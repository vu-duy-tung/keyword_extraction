I got the lunch special which was 1/3 pound of any sliced meat, side and a drink for $10.99. I chose the brisket which was flavorful, moist and very tender. They cut and weigh the meat in front where you can see and serve everything on a tray with parchment paper rather than plates. The sweet BBQ sauce is just right and a great compliment to the brisket. I highly recommend it and can't wait to come back when in town.",

    "text": "We decided to head out for some BBQ, after finding this place on Yelp.  We weren't quite sure what to expect, and were pleasantly surprised.  Since it was our first time, the very nice and friendly woman at the counter let us sample some of their brisket...amazing!  Also, the gentleman who was cutting and serving the food, was quite friendly and answered questions.  We went with the sampler, so we could try a little bit of everything.  It consisted of:  pulled pork (my absolute favorite!!!), brisket (we got the moist, and it definitely was), chicken (juicy, but a little bland), St. Louis ribs (the meat was so tender...delicious!),turkey (surprisingly tender, moist and flavorful), sausage (also quite flavorful!) plus 2 sides--we decided on potato salad and cole slaw (both really good, but I favored the slaw).  It was also served with some white bread, which is perfect to make little sandwiches, or sop up some sauce.  They had 2 sauces, a mild and spicy one.  I prefer the mild, it was sooo deliciously sweet, I could almost drink it by itself.  Hubby tried the spicy, and it was a bit much for him.  So, he also stuck with the mild, and couldn't get enough of it.  Throw in a couple of iced teas, and you've got yourself a meal...actually 2, since there was so much food, we ended up taking some home and having it later.  My only \"complaint\" is the booths...they really need to update the seats.  They were all cracked and you could feel the springs as you slid into the dips.  We will definitely head out there again, it's a bit of a drive, but for that pulled pork, I'll go anywhere!!!  Oh, and by the way, it's all gone!  We devoured our leftovers while watching some TV...it was still delicious warmed up.",

Entrance: Greeted by a couple of cashiers not sure which is willing to take my order.   Food: I order jalapeno sausage and regular sausage to see what the two were like. Mind you guys my review has a 31 years of experience of Texas bbq eatin. Always about the good ol sausage. However, this was not the experience I was looking for. I got it to go and when I got to where I was going, I decided to dive into the Jalapeno sausage and after unwrapping it, just by looking at I notice it looked super dry. I was even afraid to take a bite of it. I did it anyways and it was disgusting, I wouldn't have served that to any guys. Owners if you are going to use the Texas name, you sure as the hell need to get it together. You're not representing Texas in great spirit. I'm actually kind of upset your using the name and selling that crap to anyone for that matter. I'm not going to discredit the regular sausage because it wasn't as dry and tasted pretty good. But let's just say the jalapeno sausage left a bad taste behind.  Why not a 5: Well no need to go into details, hopefully you fix your issues, not sure how you became highly rated, but I'm in hopes my next visit I'll be able to see why.

We ordered the potato salad and the beans and the cream corn.  I wouldn't shut up about the beans.  We also got one of the jalapeno sausages.  It was pretty tasty as well.   I also went for lunch one day and got their lunch special.  I was amazingly full by the time I left, but managed to have some of their pecan pie.  It was tasty!  I would definitely go back, and also wouldn't hesitate to recommend others to go.   While I don't consume alcohol, I loved that when you walk in the door that there are coolers on the side that you can grab a bottle of beer out of.  It is a clean-feeling restaurant.  I liked that you order it by the pound and so, if desired, could order like 1/4 pound of this and 1/4 pound of that.  It is very affordable.  Two of us ate more than a healthy portion of food and it was only like $28.  Not bad for 3 sides, 3 servings of meat, drinks and bread.   It closes at 7pm though, so don't venture over here if you won't make it before then.",

    "text": "Excellent Texas BBQ from a little hole in the wall! Some reviewers here seem to be confusing this place with one in Scottsdale listed elsewhere on Yelp. Too bad as it affects their rating. We went on a Sunday about an hour before they closed so unfortunately they were out of the sausage I wanted to try. Offered a sample of brisket and man was it good (and I am very picky about fatty meat)! Decided on the pulled pork, side and drink special for $8.99. The pork was delicious as was the mac & cheese side. Reviews on here complaining about food served on a piece of butcher paper, the decor, and some of the other negatives must not have ever eaten BBQ in a real Texas joint. If you're not going for the great Texas BBQ, then please don't go.You'll ruin it for the rest of us. It's a half hour drive for us to get there but we will definitely be going back. This would be a great stop for food before a DBacks game.",

The sausage was excellent just disappointed they didn't have spicy jalapeno the last 2 times I've been there which I prefer over regular sausage but I've enjoyed the regular had plenty of flavor. I lived in Texas and ate my share of bbq and this is the real deal. They have two sauces hot and mlld, slices of bread are available upon request plus they have the pickles, onions, peppers are available as well. The sides are just sides nothing real special but their beans are the best in my opinion. All served in a tray on butcher paper just like in Texas! The last time i was there it was cash only so just be prepared. The neighborhood is a little sketchy but the bbq is for real! Don't Judge it by its cover.. Would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves bbq and lives around Phoenix go check it out!",

    "text": "In general, I love BBQ.  I grew up with a mom who raked snow and ice off the grill to BBQ in the winter!    I tried a few BBQ places when I first moved here, but I gave up on BBQ in Phoenix shortly after moving here and I didn't eat BBQ unless I cooked it.  Unfortunately for  all BBQ places in Phoenix (past, present and future), as far as I am concerned, there is LMBBQ(I try not to use another business' name in my reviews) and then there are all other BBQ places in Phoenix.    I stopped here on a whim to give this place a second try, 2 years after the first time.  I was underwhelmed by the food that I tried.  I ordered the Po'Boy sandwich... a mountain of meat... sausage, brisket (chef's choice), and pulled pork.  The meat was far too saucy for me.  I do not care for sauce on my BBQ.  I prefer the sauce as a garnish,  on the side. I think it was added to the sandwich and I wish I had been asked. The sauce wasn't very tasty itself.  The brisket was tender and juicy, but it lacked a deep smokey flavor that I enjoy!  Same for the brisket.  The sausage on my sandwich didn't taste fresh,  so I didn't eat it more than a bite or two.   Rather unfortunate because I bet normally the regular sausage is good.   The only bright spot was the jalapeno sausage I ordered on the side that, it JUST occurred to me, didn't taste like it was spiced with jalapeno, but black pepper.  Nevertheless,  the sausage was not greasy and it tasted pretty good.     i really would like to see BBQ places in and around Phoenix win, but this place is didn't satisfy my taste-buds.  For Phoenix, I suppose it meets some folks needs.  For me, its a \"do not return\", unless LMBBQ burns down.  Return Factor - 1%.",

My meal was served on a huge serving platter along with pickled onions and jalapeno.   The ribs had a bit of a unique flavor.

    "text": "I am leaning towards a 2 star rating but am bumping it up because I thought the service was great and the two boys that helped me carry my order to my car.  I really really wanted to like this place.  It is close to home but doesn't accept credit cards.  That always is annoying.  I like that you are offered a sample if you have never been.  I didn't care that much for the sample so I should have known right there.  I ordered 1 pound of lean brisket as my children do not like fat on their food.  I also ordered some st louis style ribs as they were out of beef ribs.  We added on a small container or creamed corn, a large container of macaroni and cheese and a gallon of sweet tea.  The bill was over $40 for a lunch that I had to bring home and dish out for me and 3 kids.  I think that is pretty pricey!  Everything tasted very peppery to me.  We were offered a choice of spicy or regular BBQ sauce.  They came in identical containers.  One had a marking on top which I couldn't see or notice when I got them home to open them.  I had to taste all of them before offering to kids.  The spicy was way to hot.  The regular was good but it killed my stomach trying to figure out which was which with each container.  I didn't care for the choices of bread - sesame hamburger style buns for a plastic bag or white bread slice.  Was hoping for homemade rolls or biscuits.  Brisket was very forgettable.  The ribs were best of the meats and I am not a fan of pork.    The creamed corn was by far the best part of the meal.  This was the only thing that I actually enjoyed.  Mmmmmm....  The macaroni and cheese was $8 and got thrown away with only what we sampled gone from the top.  Sad because mac & ch is one of my all time favorite foods, same with the kids.  Tons of flakes of black pepper.  Didn't like anything about it.  The sweet tea was a hit with the children since I never let them have caffeine but it was sweet and not refreshing to me.  I am more a fan of unsweet though so that could likely just be my personal opinion.  I wish the restaurant much success but these neighbors won't be back.  :(",

    "text": "I would have given this 3.5 stars if it was an option. I ordered the fatty brisket (.5 lb serving), a side of potato salad, and a cup for water. It was $11 after a $3 off coupon they offered for Yelp users. The value was fine, as this is about the market rate for BBQ. I noticed the menu had a few lunch specials that appeared to have a solid value.   The location is just off the northeast corner of the intersection and parking is limited. I would recommend carpooling if you plan on visiting with others. We arrived during the noon hour and service was concise and cordial. If you don't have time to wait out Little Miss BBQ - the best BBQ in Phoenix, in my estimation - this would seem to be a timely alternative and not far from the interstate. There's a fair amount of seating outside and picnic tables on the patio.  The brisket was good. Definitely above average but it didn't stand out. If I could go back, I would have ordered lean brisket because the fatty wasn't trimmed properly and there was some waste I had to cut off myself. If the price was a little lower, again, $9.30 is certainly reasonable for a half-pound, I could more easily excuse there being some waste. The flavor and moisture were both solid, though the burnt ends were a bit rubbery. There wasn't a strong smoky flavor to it but it was still satisfying.   As for the sides, the potato salad was decent. Nothing remarkable but certainly complementary with the brisket. The portion was pre-scooped into a cup and refrigerated. A friend I was with ordered the mac 'n cheese which I found to be quite good. The cheese was silky and had a pinch of pepper dashed in to add some dimension.   Overall, I was pleased with my experience and there was nothing, in a vacuum, that would keep me from returning. If I find myself craving some BBQ in the future and I don't have the time to wait at Little Miss, this is certainly an alternative I would consider.",

Anything with Texas in the name has my intrigue when it comes to BBQ  First of all, you get $3 off for checking in to Yelp which is a huge plus in my book. Great move by the owner. The parking is a little sparse, but we managed to get a good spot with minimal line. They have a great selection of BBQ from both fatty and lean brisket, to their signature sandwich the Texas Po Boy. The prices were consistent with other BBQ joints.  I ordered the Texas Po Boy because it covered the main types of food you're looking for: brisket, pulled pork and sausage. This sandwich is huge and comes with plenty of meat. I'd suggest it if you're coming hungry and ready to eat. It was quite tasty for every bite. The down side for me was that the sausage tended to overpower the other meats, which makes sense due to the strength of sausage flavor as a whole. I also wish they had their own BBQ sauce selection for customers. I was not a fan of the BBQ sauce they put on the sandwich for you. I would have liked to add my own, and had options like you do at other places. If you're getting brisket, I would recommend getting the lean. My friend had the \"moist\" brisket and it had a little too much fat on it. That was coming from a guy who loves fatty brisket.  All in all, it was a good BBQ experience and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for good BBQ and not in the mood to stand in line for a long time. I would definitely return when in the area.",

Normally get the Brisket and some Jalapeno Sausage. They have a small area off to the side with onions, pickles, jalapenos and some hot sauces. There are two different house sauces that they make and serve. One is mild and the other hotter.  Food is pretty good but not super great. My Brisket and Sausage seemed to be at room temperature and not very warm. The Sausage was dry and could of had more fat in it. The white bread was not very fresh and tasted like it had been sitting out too long.  Be careful where you sit down. I tried one of the red booths and about killed myself. Apparently the springs are shot and you end up lower than your body was expecting. Play it safe and go with the chair.  Definitely better than a lot of the sweeter styles that are offered around town. Give them a try and see what you think. Located south of the river in an area of town that could use some urban renewal. SMOKIN A-OK!  3.25 STARS",

    "text": "Had the brisket.  It was moist but too fatty.  Pulled pork -- portion size not bad but would have preferred sauce to be on the side. Too much sauce overpowers the flavor.    Love that food is served on paper.  Seems environmentally friendly and gives homey feel.   Pork ribs are really salty with a bunch of spices -- there's a kick there.  Definitely don't get the ribs because of the over spice. Meat does not fall off bone. Another reason to stay clear of them.  So disappointed.  Recommend the pinto beans and sweet tea.  That's all.",

The chopped beef made a delicious sandwich (for the record, a 1/2 lb of chopped beef makes 2 hefty sandwiches for less $ than most bbq joints charge for 1) but the star here was the lean brisket. Might be too dry for some but I prefer mine super lean cuz you can always add some sauce to it. They do have moist brisket as well.  The sausage was tasty too and I can't wait to see what the jalapeno version is doing.  Top notch quality and for a price that isn't gonna hurt your wallet. Proof that a lot of valley bbq restaurants are charging too much.  To put it plain and simple, THIS BBQ IS LARAPIN!  Oh yeah, cash only.",

Their flag flies at the same height as the US flag....and they make insanely killer BBQ. This is a little taste of Texas right here in AZ. As a former San Antonian - I know BBQ! Don't let the location deter you - once you step inside those doors you're transported to the Lone Star state.   The food was delicious. We tried the pork ribs, the moist brisket, and the sausage. All amazing - their meat is cooked to perfection. Next time I need to save room for the pecan pie. They serve the meat with slices of white bread and there are pickles and onions on the side - that's how they do it in Texas :) .   The service was incredible - these guys are great. They are wiling to accommodate their customers however they can. They are going to have all the NFL games this season - they have several t.v.'s. This is a perfect place to grab lunch and catch a game.   I really hope all my fellow downtowners will take the time to drive a few miles south and support this business. The food is great and affordable - one of the least expensive BBQ places I've been too. Go and eat some great food and enjoy some Texas hospitality. You won't be sorry!",

I also tried the lean brisket and moist brisket.  The sample of moist brisket was the best I have ever tasted; I would have ordered it, but sampled it after I bought the pork loin.  I have to knock it down one star for a few reasons, but I will be back many, many times for sure!   I was not a big fan of the banana pudding; it did not taste very fresh today.  A couple of the reviewers noted how good it was; I may have ordered it on an off day.   I am also disappointed that you can not order a traditional sandwich; basically, they give you white sandwich bread and offer to chop the meat up for you.  There is only one type of BBQ sauce, and I am not a huge fan of it.  But as the other reviewers noted, the meat tastes so good you may not even want any sauce!!!",

We also had the mac and cheese, homemade and perfect. My husband ordered the Texas Po Boy sandwich, a full pound of meat. Smoked sausage, brisket and pulled pork it was so flavorful. He also ordered the green beans, I didn't try them but he said they were very tasty. The staff was very friendly. The chef (maybe owner) gave us a sample of brisket. We got there before 7 (closing time) but no one rushed us and the waitress even stood and chatted with us for a bit.

Funny Story:  the first time I brought some meat home from here, my son smelled the bag and said, \"Smells like the Family Reunion up in here.\"  We always have brisket at our annual family reunion back in Texas, so when he smells brisket, he always thinks of that.....:)  I had made two trips here to get a variety of meats and sides, and they have ( for the most part ) all been big hits with me and the kiddos.  Lean brisket - can be a little dry-ish, but that's what you get when you lose the fat. Moist brisket - really moist, and excellent smoky flavor. Pork Loin - my son raved about it, called it the best pork he ever tried. Jalapeno Sausage link - nice flavor, but not hot enough for me. BBQ Chicken - nothing special - a weak point in the meats Chopped Beef - also known as chipped beef, and the sauce is a little overpowering and too salty. Red Beans - a little meat in there, and other flavors - VERY GOOD. Potato Salad - nothing memorable about it, but it was \"good\" Ribs - good flavor, but not tender enough for my tastes.  I like them falling off the bone. Banana Pudding - was GREAT one time, and was GROSS another time - WTH?  It will run about $12 per person to get a good \"two servings each\" batch of meats, so that is pretty reasonable for the quality of meat you get.  And lucky for me, they are only a couple of miles from home.  I have found my Go-To Texas BBQ place.",

Having noticed on previous reviews that they sometimes run out of brisket, I called at 10am when they opened to put in my order of moist brisket. Very glad I did because another man arrived at 4:30pm as I was picking up our brisket and was told they had run out fairly early that day. Poor old man had driven 30 minutes just to have the brisket and the rest of us had already vultured the stock. I felt bad, but not bad enough to share. The moist brisket was AMAZING. Like jaw dropping amazing. We never thought we'd have anything that rivaled Franklin's BBQ in Austin, Texas but this place might just do it. They were sold out of Jalapeno Sausage too, which other reviews suggested was good. I can't speak to that, but the creamed corn and macaroni were good. The creamed corn was somewhat unique so I'd probably go with that over the mac n cheese, but really you should skip sides altogether and just order more brisket. I might try one of the leaner cuts one day, but I also might not because the moist brisket totally knocked my socks off. Yum.  As for the old man, I think he ordered some pulled pork instead and seemed pretty happy with how that tasted as well so all is not lost if you show up late to the party.",

Cost with small beverage slightly over $22. The food tasted great with the ribs looking cooked to perfection, BUT a few hours later...I could not get off the toilet. I don't know if they used MSG in the food or what, but it doesn't matter how good the food tastes going down if it gives you \"Montezuma's Revenge\" later! I was going to give it 4 solid stars, subtracting a fifth star for boring sides and dilapidated seating, but I cannot say I'll be going back...except to my bathroom!",

My wife had the pulled pork sliders. They were also really good. The cream corn was excellent . Next time, I will,get there earlier, because I really want to try the brisket. I would definitely recommend this place.",

We also ordered Texas cream corn, coleslaw and mac n cheese to share.  We got the small portions for all of them and the size was just enough to try everything and be satisfied.  Brisket was amazing without the sauce, but even better with it.  Super tender.  Coleslaw and cream corn were great and I'll definitely have those again.  I absolutely LOVE the cream corn.  I could have a big ol' container of just that.  The mac n cheese was good.  Not great, but good.  The sweet tea was AWESOME.  They should bottle that up and sell it.  The staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and offered suggestions.  I loved the little boys that were working and hanging out.  From the look of things it seemed like their dad owns or runs the place.  One of them was so sweet and polite.  We would ask for things and he would say, \"yes mam, no mam, thank you mam\".  He even asked how everything was.  I'd go back just to hang out with him.  The only thing I noticed different from when I visited over a year ago was that they no longer sell beer and while I'd like a Shiner to add to my Texas bbq experience, the food and the staff are enough to make me come back.",

The owner (or one of them) was there and was so friendly, helpful and entertaining. Don't let the area or the building scare you... this holds True to the fact that \"the best food comes from mom and pop hole in the walls\".  The only thing I would change, is they hold back a bit on the spices in there rubs... and the BBQ sauce could be a bit better.... But all in all, great place and one of the best BBQ places in Arizona.",

I got the rib special, which come with 4 ribs, a drink, and one side, I got the mac and cheese. The ribs were falling off the bone. Texas bbq is a big fan of just seasoning the ribs with salt and pepper, and you can definitely taste it there. I am more of a sweet rib guy, but I still liked it. I also got the most brisket, which was to die for. It had that perfect bark on it, and it melted in your mouth. Then there was the mac and cheese, which has to be some of the best I have ever had. It has creamy, and some added pepper. I don't like it when the cheese is to thick. This place was really amazing. The only thing I didn't like was the price, I know smoked bbq can get pricey, but I think it was a little to expensive.",

But they were able to throw together a custom sampler plate for me with their brisket, turkey, and 2 types of sausage. It did not disappoint.  The brisket was \"fatty brisket\" and it was packed with flavor. I'm a BBQ junkie so I've had some of the best brisket in the world and their brisket is right up there.  The Turkey might have been the best BBQ turkey I've ever had. Sliced thick, tender, and packed with flavor.  Their jalapeno sausage did outshine their regular sausage, but both were fantastic.

The people working here are down to earth, you'll hear good ole country music playing in the background and you can count on seeing NFL network playing on at least one TV.  They serve your food in Pepsi and Coke creates, don't go looking for plates cause all you'll find is ole fashion wax paper.   If you don't like this place I would like to understand what makes you rise to the level of nirvana.     The parking lot is..... the first word that comes to mind that's smaller than \"tiny\". I would say parking is intimate but that's the adjective.",

The brisket was unbelievable too, and I don't even like brisket... Unfortunately they were out of beef ribs so I cant even imagine how good those are, will obviously be back to try them. Really nice people too. So far this place is better than Rudy's (pulled pork wise and sauce wise) I just wish they had baby backs instead of the St. Louis cut so cant really make a conclusion until those beef ribs have been tasted.",

This BBQ is Texas style all the way and few places outside of Texas can duplicate. The moist brisket is amazing and I like their sides and desserts as well. The owners are always there and give that family feel to the place. I recommend this place to everyone I run across. ***Disclaimer, this is not the kind of place that will make your sandwich for you and drench food with BBQ sauce. You get the food by the weight and make it your self. Its Texas style, all about the meat! Get Bread if you want and add sauce if you want. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Being from Texas, I am skeptical about all things barbecue and chicken fried outside of home.  Most places, hard as they try, will never get it right.  That being said, Texas BBQ House was like stepping into a teleporter that brought me right back to the doorstep of home.   Served up in a traditional Texas style, you walk up to the counter and order various meats by the pound.  They are sliced right in front of you, placed on butcher paper and set in a plastic crate.  You grab cold sides from a reach in fridge and order hot sides from one of the nice men at the counter.  They've got sweet tea, the good Coke (the Mexican kind in the bottle that still has real sugar), and IBC in a bottle.  Doesn't get much better than that.  Every single meat (and I do believe we tried them all) was moist and just seemed to fall apart as you picked it up.  A quality Famous Dave's has yet to master with their brisket.  The boyfriend and I decided to try order as much as we could, stuff ourselves, and go home with leftovers.  As we ordered, the staff would cut us both samples of each meat.  We were not disappointed in a single one.   After loading up on brisket, jalapeno sausage, pork loin, and ribs, they brought us samples of the creamed corn and pinto beans.  Both were excellent, but we just went with creamed corn (like we didn't already have enough food).  And what kind of barbecue dinner is complete without potato salad and coleslaw?  So, we threw both of those on as well. In True Texas tradition, they hand you as many slices of white sandwich bread as you'd like, you pay, and you're on your way to carnivore heaven.   Like I said, everything we had was delicious and I guarantee this little gem would not be shunned back home.  There are LCD televisions in every corner and they'll put on whatever game you'd like to watch.  It's chilly now, but during the nicer months you can enjoy your feast outside on picnic benches under a covered patio.  It's in the middle of nowhere, (24th street and Broadway) we nearly missed it, but they are opening a second location in Scottsdale sometime in January 2012.  I think I'll still head out to this one, though, as I can't really see myself eating barbecue around the Scottsdale crowd.  They close early (7 pm) so don't waste daytime.   Next time I'm in, we'll try not to overload ourselves and leave room for dessert.  I'm eager to try the banana pudding and the boyfriend loves pecan pie. So, I'll update on that as soon as we get hungry again.",

On my first trip I had some of the moist brisket, some ribs and some sausage.  The ribs were okay, but could have used a spicier rub on the meat. Not much smoke on them either. The brisket is so-so. Granted that this is the only place I've found in the valley to serve moist brisket or even give you a choice, but the meat was lacking flavor. It was tender though. The sauce is sweet and lacking a kick either from vinegar or spice, but if the meat is good who cares about the sauce. Sausage was just okay, didn't taste smoke on the sausage at all. I'll try this place one more time, but there are better places in the valley where the BBQ has more flavor from the rub and smoke than Texas BBQ house. I was really excited to try this place after reading the reviews, but was let down Hopefully the second time I try will be better",

NOTE: Do NOT confuse the little tiny kinda scary joint on Broadway and 27th ish street with this place.  They had a BIG sign that said \"Teax BBQ\" so I got confused.  We almost ordered but I just felt like this was NOT the place, so we left and I found it.  SOOOO glad we did!  Ok, so when I asked my husband for his rating of this place...he Stood Up and shot me a 5-Finger Salute.  *lol*  His new FAVORITE BBQ joint.  I must say, as a native Phoenician with no real experience with regional BBQs, I thought the food was top notch.  I just didn't have small kittens like my hubby...  :)  We ordered... - Moist Beef Brisket (5/5 - yum!  I never knew beef could be so moist and flavorful WITHOUT any BBQ dripping over it!) - Creamed Corn (DH said it was done right like his Grandma used to do it.  First time I have EVER eaten creamed corn...and liked it.  I will actually order it next time.) - Mac & Cheese (Just good ole creamy mac & cheese.  Wanted way more...) - Banana Pudding (VERY homemade.  Big chunks of banana in a creamy yummy pudding with 2 like Nila wafers and a big dollop of whipped cream.  We split and DH thought it was delish) - Pecan Pie (pretty good as well.  Not life changing but solid) - Sweet Teas (Diabetic Warning!  This sh_t it SO sweet, *I* did NOT get a refill!  I mean, it was totally yummy...but I started to feel my system balk at the suger overload....which means my southern DH thought it was made just right :P)  The white bread slices straight outta the bag struck me as hilarious but again, DH thought it was even more authentic due to it (and the country music, which he was digging.  Even I tapped a toe along).  The staff was super friendly and the small shop (seats outside as well though) was very comfortable for playing MTG.  They are located in an area some might consider \"Sketchy\" but I bet the building (which looks new or renovated and is lovely btw) was affordable for them!  PS:  Anyone in need of a relaxer or a fade - they are connected to a salon/barber shop which was nice looking and the barber had a line so good sign!  Seriously good eats.  Keep them in business.  I am NOT a big meat eater and I already know my next meal!   MTG Score: DH 3 / Me 0",

The pulled pork and coleslaw are not to be missed (shredded things drenched in tasty sauce = all systems go), and save room for the old-fashioned banana pudding. Not many folks in the Southwest can make a banana pudding like these fellas... and even fewer can make my mother literally pull the dessert we're sharing away from me and finish it before I've had my second bite.   Between BBQ sauce that I'd lick off the bottom of an old cowboy boot and brisket that makes me feel disloyal to my own grandmother's secret recipe, these are the areas where Texas BBQ truly shines. There's no question that this comfy hole-in-the-wall knows how to put a sauce-stained smile on my face.",

I was very put off by the fact that you are just given some slabs of meat on tissue paper. Not even a plate! If you wanted bread you were given some slices of generic white store bought bread. No thanks! The meat was good. There didn't seem to be much selection though. We all had a side of Mac and that was also fine. Shared a pecan pie slice and that was very good! The wait staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was cute. I just can't stop the comparison and feeling like I missed out. My whole family agreed.",

We avoided our regular haunt (Rudy's) and selected the new places from the best of Yelp and recommendations of local friends.  We found some winners and some losers, but Texas BBQ was by far the best of the bunch.  I had the Po' Boy special, which was a sausage topped with brisket and pulled pork, nearly a pound of meat.  All three meats were top notch, but the brisket was significantly better than most places.  My wife decided to go with the turkey breast and the creamed corn.  The breast was very moist with a nice smoke ring.  She also really liked their sauces, but her favorite of all was the creamed corn.  They make it from scratch, and it has a bit of Jalapeno for flavor.  I've never had a creamed corn that quite matched it.  The owner was very friendly and helpful, and allowed us to sample several other meats.  His young son was clearing tables, and was very polite and fun to chat with about the pit and the business.",

    "text": "Unlike most of the folks who wrote real reviews down below, I'm not from TX and I've never tried TX BBQ.  I can't compare it to any place in Austin, Dallas or Lubbock.  But I have taste buds.  And they liked it.  They liked it a lot.    I love BBQ.  Sure, there's better and worse BBQ around town based on where ya go, but generally speaking if I go to a BBQ place, I'm going to enjoy myself.  But that doesn't mean I'm going to recommend the place, or come back again, and it really doesn't mean that I'm going to write a review on it.  But as I sit here wondering how I ate that whole freaking sandwich, I know that I have just had one of the best BBQ nights in a long, long time.  And once my stomach isn't full (say, tomorrow afternoon?) I'll be calling friends to plan our next trip there.    OM-frickin-G it is awesome!  As has been mentioned in other reviews they hooked us up with some samples when we said we hadn't been there before.  Sure, their brisket leaves this taste of buttery meat in your mouth (if you don't understand that, I'm sorry for you) and makes you want much much more - but why has no one mentioned the turkey?  We only got a sample of it, but DANG I could eat a lot of that!  One day when I'm trying to be \"healthy\" I'll get that but today was not that day.  I got what I believe was called the Big ol' Boy sandwich.  When he called back for the guys to make it he said to make a BIg ol' Girl.  Nice touch dude.  So the sandwich is 1/3 pound each of BBQ chopped pork, brisket and hot links.  I am not a fan of hot links, but figured I'd give it a shot as I liked the general concept (It actually comes out as a sandwich vs. it being a make your own thing...).  I LOVED the hotlinks.  That casing had an awesome \"pop\" as you bit into it, had a black pepper-y hint that I loved, and was good enough that I would almost contemplate trying one solo.  And I have NEVER felt that way about a hot link before.  Between our samples and our meals I got to try all 3 kinds of brisket and I don't know that I'll be able to tell you my favorite.  Like picking a favorite child.  Sure, Bobby is the juiciest, but Jimmy tastes intense and smokey...well, you know what I mean...  Not sure how new this is - but they now have 2 BBQ sauces for your eating pleasure.  Normal and HOT.  Hot won't burn your lip, but definitely makes the tongue to a double take.  And the service.  Clap... Clap... Clap..Clap..Clap.Clap.Clap.Clap!!!  Right on point.  By the end of the end of our introduction to the food we knew what things were made fresh that day, what things were made every other day or weekly, and which ones came from his Grandma's kitchen.  Thank you Grandma - for both the recipes and raising folks right.  Folks were just as sweet as that tea.    I was also happy to see that even though we got there around 6:20pm and they close at 7pm, there were 3 big parties and 1 to go order that came after us.  Please folks - keep these people busy!  Don't you dare let this place go out of business because I have found my new BBQ heaven.    Review done.  Tummy still full.  Texting friends to make our next trip...",

They are from Corpus Christi, TX, so they indeed can claim \"Texas BBQ\" to their name.  Brisket was incredible moist and tender.  They apparently smoke their brisket in Oakwood for 18 hours.  Also samples Pulled Pork, St. Louis ribs, and a hot link.  Pulled Pork was also 5-stars!  Ribs and hot link weren't anything special but were still tasty (Phil's BBQ in San Diego still is king of ribs IMO).    If you give Texas BBQ house a try (and you certainly should) definitely stick to Brisket and Pulled Pork.  It's phenomenal.",

Awesome bbq served the right way, smoked fresh in house, cut fresh when ordered, dry except the pulled pork and chopped brisket, but sauce is on the table. House made of course. A tiny little shop with a tiny patio that's worth seeking out if you're in the South valley! I'll be back for sure.",

As you progress in service the line the manager stands on the food line mean mugging you all the way through the transaction, \"creepy owner\". Also total inconsistency on operating hours and always running out of meats, all of this at the expense of customer service. You never know when they are going to be open or they just decide they will be closed one weekend. 4 times of showing up on a scheduled day of operation and they were closed for some random reason. Today was the final straw. Arrived 1:30 pm and they are scheduled to close at 3 pm. Place shut down with a sign on the door \"Sorry ran out of meats\". The food was so good I looked past the above irritations up to now, but today a line in the sand has been drawn as I say \"bye Felicia\" forever as a customer and all of my food recommendations for my work colleagues , family, and friends. Great cook, lousy business acumen.",

Their Cream Corn OMG they ALWAYS run out and I can always only get a pint which to be honest is never enough, I always want more. Their Sausage, Turkey, Ribs Beef or Pork, their pulled Pork...All delish! We always go for their best item which is the BRISKET. OMG my mouth is watering just thinking about it!

    "text": "This is definitely my favorite barbecue spot in Arizona. They are consistent with their food and the customer service is always on point. I like my Brisket with a little fat on it and their cutting is perfect. My girlfriend likes hers with fat all the way through and I must say it's pretty good also. Their St. Louis Ribs are tender and flavorful before the sauce is even thought about, and the Hot Links while smaller than I'm use to pack a nice punch of spice and flavor. I also like that the Mac & Cheese is cheesy, already seasoned, and not runny like its out of a cheap box. The Green Beans are also full of flavor with just the right amount of meat mixed in. I can't wait to go back and eat.   Now I recommend calling ahead if your going after work or close to closing time. They once ran out of every meat except pulled pork, but that's when I knew I was going to be back. If they run out of meat it must be good!   #FoodJones on IG",

All the elements for this to have been a home run were there - quaint location, screen patio door, the picnic tables. But, beyond that it just didn't land for me.   I ordered the lunch special and got the brisket and potato salad. The potato salad was my fault. I was raised to know that you can't trust just anyone's potato salad. But, the brisket...it was way too fatty for me.   Again, everyone seems to love it. But, if you were born below the Mason-Dixon line, proceed with caution.",

Shiner available but no Lone Star. All good. Also, I could use some type of green veg next time, even if it is fried. Perhaps some green beans with bacon and onion?  P.S. I'm a born and raised Texan.

I haven't lived in rural Texas for quite a while. Since than while still living in Texas I got great pleasure from a great plate of BBQ and a cold beer. In Texas this is not a luxury but its a right.  Since I've lived in Arizona I have found some OK BBQ, some that was pretty good and some that just down right sucked. In general I wasn't particularly fond of any one place to get BBQ and I didn't look forward to the prospect of being in the general area of any particular BBQ joint.  This all has changed tonight. I just had by far the best BBQ I have ever had in Arizona. \"Texas BBQ House\" has got it right. They understand what it's supposed to be and how to present it to the public. Let me tell you how BBQ is done in Texas and than I will explain my experience tonight.  In Texas: *You are always treated with respect, a smile and feel welcome *You always order your meat by the pound *You never get a plate (meat paper) or a sandwich *You have choices when it comes to what kind of Brisket (lean & moist, two separate things) *You have a good selection of sides (beans, cole slaw, potato salad, corn) *Sweet Tea is a must *Good selection of condiments (pickles, onions, jalapenos) *Shiner Bock Beer *Decent country music playing  Texas BBQ House:  *I was treated with respect, a smile and felt welcome *I ordered my meat by the pound *No plates only meat paper *I had a choices of three types of Brisket *I had a good selection of sides (beans, cole slaw, potato salad, corn *i had Sweet Tea *I had a selection of condiments (pickles, onions, jalapenos) *A stack of Shiner Bock Beer *They had decent country music playing  I have completed my search for Damn Good BBQ in Phoenix, if you haven't tried this place do yourself a favor and drop in.  Note: They are not on Scottsdale Road, they only take cash and they close at 7:00 PM. All more reasons for me to like this place, it's a tiny bit of Texas just south of the Airport.",

It may not be quite as good as Rudy's, but it is pretty close.   I usually tend to stick to the lean brisket and turkey  to keep the fat and calories down and I enjoy both cuts very much. Some might not think they have enough flavor or juicyness. If so, try the moist brisket and the pork ribs. More fat and calories, but definitely more flavor.   Everything is served in the traditional Texas style, on butcher paper. Your tray is an old soda crate, and your plate is a clean sheet of butcher paper. The staff will give you a few slices of white bread based on the amount of meat you purchased. More meat, more bread.  You grab the three common sides, pickles, onions, and pickled jalapenos seperately  and the BBQ sauce is at the table.   If you want to purchase other sides, such as beans, cole slaw, etc, it is all there in the True Texas fashion. I recommend the creamed corn and the pinto beans.   As I said before, I have definitely had better Texas style BBQ in NM and Texas, but this place holds it own. My only real issue is I wish they would make a spicier bbq sauce.   I eat here about once a week, so the place definitely deserves a high rating.",

I left the Great State of Texas three years ago and have been disappointed by so many bbq restaurants throughout the state of Arizona. I was saddened by the  \"best bbq\" in Tucson and decided that, until I lived in Texas again, I would just live a meaningless bbq free existence.   As I moped through another day in the hottest place on the planet, my very thoughtful partner suggested that we try the best bbq in Phoenix, according to the Phoenix New Times. I resisted. I said I was tired, I made up lame excuses, I feigned heat sickness. When I had no more excuses I finally relented and joined him in what would be the most delicious dinner I have had in three f*in years.   Highlights of the meal:  Brisket- Tender, delicious, excellent rub and crust Ribs- Fall of the bone meat with great flavor Sauce- Just enough tang and sweet. Balanced like a god damned ballerina Coleslaw- Sweet, sour, crunchy, yummy Potato salad-  Oh how I love thee  I will be back again. I will blog about them. I will tell my friends. You will not be disappointed. If you don't believe me, go anyway. They offer free samples. If you don't cream your jeans, you can just walk out the door.",

    "text": "I was on a quest...BBQ and smoked goodness that could meet or beat the standard set by my favorite BBQ place, Rudy's, which is a Texas based chain with locations in Albuquerque. I rarely give 5 stars on first visit and this was pretty darn close...by PHX standards this is easily 5 stars!  Fate delivered an article in a local food Blog, It was touted as being like Rudy's as a result I took that as a challenge. Via Yelp I bookmarked it to try.   The locations is clean and casual. Just enough booths and tables and a small outside patio. The employees and the owner/manager were very friendly and helpful. He gave me a sample of their brisket. While not as smoked as I like was super tender and delicious. I decided on their Yelp Check In special (which is also a regular daily special) of 1/3# Brisket, side, bread and drink for $7.99. Here you buy the items a la carte and the meat by the pound. Like Rudy's there are no plates as they serve and you eat on Butcher paper. For my side I choose Creamed Corn...he gave me a sample first and dare I say this was better than Rudy's.    What I love that other places lack is the little bar with sliced onions, dill pickle slices and pickled whole jalapenos. The bread offered is your simple sliced loaf bread, his is traditional and typical of Texas style BBQ joints. You put a little meat onions, pickle and sauce o keep a slice of bread fold in half/eat taco style and enjoy. The sauce is a hint sweeter than I like, but the smoked flavor was what I enjoyed most.  I didn't see smoked baked potatoes on the menu, nor did I see the cobblers that Rudy's carries but that may come later. They do have have pecan pie, banana pudding to satisfy your sweet tooth. I already am planning my next trip so I can try more items on the menu.  They also have a nice small selection of bottled beer. What's BBQ without beer or fresh brewed sweet tea which they have as well. I was too full to dig into my homemade banana pudding.   Rudy's...you've found your match and I have found my go to BBQ in the valley. [It's CASH ONLY. They do have an ATM on site.]",

Their Moist Brisket is nothing short of amazing, certainly the BEST Brisket I have ever had at a Restaurant.  Their Pork Loin & Sausage are also fantastic.  I'm still working on the rest of the menu.  I will post up more once I sample all of it.  I love their Cream Corn Side as well as their Banana Pudding, I could just go there and order those all day.  This Restaurant is one of the top BBQ Restaurants here in the Phoenix area and I highly recommend everyone stop in & try them out.  I know they are working on opening up another one in South Scottsdale and I'm excited for that one as I live close to where it will be.  Stop in, tell them you read the AZBarbeque review & post up your thoughts.",

Some of the meat seems a little high but totally worth it.  Just means I wont be able to eat here as often as probably would like.  The sauce is on the sweeter side, then has a kick...and the pecan pie is homemade and isn't a True southern recipe but is really good too. If you are in the mood for great barbeque, try this place. Better than Rush's!",

    "text": "Fans of good Texas-style BBQ (sauceless meat fests where your only True side dish is white bread, onions and jalapenos served up on butcher paper) will find delight here.  There is BBQ sauce, but it's an afterthought.  You can get sides of meaty pintos, creamy cole slaw, gooey mac and cheese and damn near sinful creamed corn.  But honestly, all of the above compete with the space you're gonna want to reserve for the meat.    As far as I am concerned, the two offerings that I have dreams about are the fatty brisket (fall apart goodness that's juicy as hell) and the jalapeno sausage.  I slip into an amnesiac's haze when I eat them, devouring all in front of me and awakening once they are all gone.  Smoked turkey is surprisingly moist and full of flavor, and the pork loin is light and delicious.  The only miss on the menu for me is the chop beef - a near mash of meat and sauce that just doesn't do the trick.  Get a big ol' sweet tea before you leave, and order more than you think you'll eat, because you will definitely want it.  No fuss, no muss, just carnivore heaven.  PS. A lot of people have reviews here and they are for the Scottsdale location and not this place.  This one is in the middle of nowhere in Central Phoenix - it looks kind of like a roadhouse, which lends to the appeal.",

I also had full jalapeno link, not hat spicy, but certain yummy. The sides I had were cream corn and mac n cheese.  Cream corn was great had a little hint of sugar in it made it a little sweet tasting. The mac n cheese was nothing to brag about, the temp of mac n cheese was warm could be hotter.   Service- The employees are very polite and will let you taste any product if you are not certain between fall off the bone chicken or nice smoked beef brisket.   Environment- Felt like I was back in a Southern BBQ stop, small, cozy and loved the paper wrap as my plates (keeping it real, bravo)  **My only complaint is this, I have been back a few times and each time they are out of something. Last time it was the sausage links and they couldn't serve beer. Then I went back a month later and still out of sausage and no beer. Then I just went back on 10/15/2012 and they were out of Beef Brisket and Ribs. Come on! That is how you lose business by not keeping your product in stock. I had to go to Rudy's for beef brisket and I did not enough it.***  I will call before I go in again to see what products they are out off.",

I have to admit, this was pretty great brisket - they know what they're doing here. A little on the expensive side, but worth the try. I would definitely go back for sure!",

    "text": "To be honest, when we pulled up to this place I had my doubts.  It doesn't look like much on the outside - but I am so glad we stopped here.  This was AMAZING texas style BBQ.    We arrived about 30 minutes before closing time and were greeted by two really helpful, friendly ladies asking if we've ever been before.  This strikes me as the type of place that has a lot of regulars because the food is SO GOOD.       They offered us a sample of the moist brisket (their specialty) and we knew we'd come to the right place! The best brisket I've ever had!  We ordered the po boy sandwich and two sides to share and it was plenty of food for my husband and I and our kiddo.    I didn't try the sausage - but the pulled pork and brisket were amazing.  The BBQ sauce was tangy and the perfect compliment for both.... though the pulled pork could have been eaten alone because it already was really well seasoned.  The creamed corn and green beans were both great, flavorful and a good size for two people to share.    Do yourself a favor and check this place out.  We will seek this place out the next time we're in the area!",

    "text": "Texas BBQ House has the closest thing to Texas style brisket that I've found outside of Texas- props for offering it three ways, moist (fatty cut), cutter (chopped), or lean (why?), with my preference obviously being the first. Squirt on some of the \"hot\" bbq sauce (unless you're a pansy, then choose regular), add on a couple pickles, and it's heaven. White bread and red onions are optional.   Heads up, even though the wait time isn't nearly as bad as Little Miss BBQ, if you don't go early they'll be out of a lot of things, most definitely the ribs. Even going in an hour after opening on a weekday, they were down to just brisket, pulled pork, and sausage. That said, I'm not much of a fan of pulled pork but theirs was really good: not too saucy or too sweet. Hot links were solid, too.   Loved the atmosphere with picnic tables and outside seating, country music blasting, and three different football games playing. Really hit the spot when I was feeling homesick during the holidays. Opt for the $13 1-pound Texas PoBoy if you want a taste of everything!",

    "text": "Hate to do it, but today's meal was whack and totally deserving of this one star rating!  I had this place bookmarked for awhile and am seriously trying to hit a low carb diet pretty hard in order to lose some weight.  Low carb options are somewhat limited when eating out, so I figured a plate of meat would fit the bill.  I drove down, parked in the lot, and walked inside.  I asked the cashier lady (very friendly btw...best part of the visit) how everything worked.  She explained how everything is served by weight and even gave me a sample of fatty brisket to sample since it was my first time here.  I decided to go with a 1/4lb fatty brisket, a sausage link, and 3 pork spare ribs.  That and a fountain drink came out to $27.50!  I know BBQ is expensive, but sheesh!  It better be good for almost $30.00!  I took my tray to my table and dug in.  Here is how everything was...........  Fatty Brisket-  This was the best meat of the bunch, and even then, it was barely edible.  I am down with the fat.  Fat=flavor.  I am NOT down with whale blubber, gelatinous type fat.  This brisket had a huge bark of whale blubber fat.  I picked off most of it, and ate the actual meat part and it was decent.  Not the worst brisket I have ever had (Rudy's in Goodyear takes the cake on that one!), but nowhere even close to the best brisket I have had.  1/4lb is about 2 slices.  Probably should have tried the lean?  Who the hell knows....disappointed though!   Sausage Link-  Dry and chewy.  Flavor wasn't that great either!  Reminded me of eating a dried up hot dog.  At almost $5.00 for this link, I felt it was not worth it at all.  I made my way through about half of the link and couldn't eat any more.  Pork Spare Ribs-  These things were huge.  That is not necessarily good though.  The outside bark had a decent peppery taste, but the meat was a little tough, tasted like it was boiled, and just flat out didn't smell or taste too appealing.  I made my way through about 3/4 of one rib and was done...couldn't eat any more.    I boxed up my remaining sausage and 2 ribs and gave them to a homeless lady standing by the 17 freeway entrance.  While I was there at the light, she sat down, opened the box, took a couple of bites and then closed the box and stood back up to continue begging on the side of the road.  That right there should tell you something....a hungry, homeless person didn't even like the ribs and sausage enough to sit there and eat them!  Fuck, right?    Not sure how so many people love this place.  Service was very friendly, and that is the only positive thing I have to say about this visit.  There are way better BBQ places in town (Little Miss, Naked BBQ, even Rudy's is better than this joint!).  As I write this, about 4 hours later, my stomach hurts and it feels like I have to barf. $27.50 poorer...all for some barely edible BBQ.  Horrible!  I will never come back!",

The sausage was out of this world - probably one of the best smoked sausages I've ever had. The brisket, on the other hand, was just okay. In general, at least for my palate, the smoke flavor was too subtle - parts of the lean meat without the bark tasted like brisket coming out of an oven, despite the amazing smoke ring. I'd probably go back for the sausage, but in my opinion, a place that dares to put \"Texas\" and \"BBQ\" in its name absolutely has to nail brisket.",

It was dynamite and my wife ordered the brisket and got the hamburger bun to make herself an awesome sandwich.  I got the po boy sandwich, 1/3lb brisket, 1/3lb pulled pork, and 1/3 pound sausage (no bread). It was ridiculous! I liked the sausage, with mustard, but the other two were outta this world.

The guy told us that they only have so much per day and it is best to come in earlier to ensure that we get some.  We decided to try the moist and the cutter's choice and a couple variations of sauce, original and spicy.    Overall, it wasn't bad.  The moist brisket definitely lives up to the name and the cutter's choice had a pretty good texture to it.  The spicy sauce had more spice than flavor though.  I would recommend the cutter's choice and the original sauce personally.  It isn't as good as some of the BBQ I have had in New Orleans but it is decent for something closer to home if the hankering arises.    If you haven't tried it yet, I think you will enjoy it.",

    "text": "Simply put, I have not had a better brisket ever.    I'm a frequent visitor of PHX for work and have had the opportunity to try many places. Many may be put off by its location, which seems away from the city proper, but I know from experience that there are some great finds on roads less travelled.   Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  I told them I was new and asked them what were their best sellers.  Mike, who I later found out was the owner, cut me a not-so-shy slice of moist brisket.  The flavor blew me away.  From that initial experience, this has been a regular meal spot when I travel to PHX.  In many places that do dry-rub bbq, there isn't a heavy emphasis on sauce.  At texas bbq house, they once again stand out with a great regular and spicy sauce that adds to an already amazingly seasoned cut.  You don't need the sauce, but its good to know you have a good one on stand-by.  Im also perplexed on the other reviews regarding customer service.  They have always been friendly with me at lunch or dinner. This past visit I was greeted by 3 boys, the owners sons, who ensured visitors were taken care of and tables were cleaned for the next guests. A True mom and pop location that deserves praise!     Thanks Mike and team!  See you next time!",

Made myself a tall sandy for lunch by adding pickles and a sliced pepper (hot as hell).  Service is great.  Appears one of the kids works the floor, and he's sharp as a tack cleaning up after customers.  Even offered to run down a drink refill for me.    Great booths to sit in, tvs playing sports, comfortable covered outdoor patio, etc.    Only drawback was this big banner on the side wall that read, \"You're in (Dallas) Cowboy Country.\"  Eh, I hate the Dallas Cowboys, but I didn't see Tony Romo or Jerry Jones, so I'll come back for the BBQ.",

    "text": "They should change the name of this place to just \"BBQ House.\"  The Texas part is unfair to them as the BBQ in the state of Texas cannot stand up to this place.  I say this as I meander through Texas tasting any smoked flesh I can get my hands on.    The brisket at the Texas BBQ House is the best I've ever had...hands down.  I've eaten enough in my time to fill an airplane hanger so I think I'm qualified on the subject.  If you fed this to a vegan, they'd leave the restaurant and go on a long spree of violence once they realized what they were missing in life.  It's that good.  Here's the thing though, average BBQ still tastes pretty good and most of your life you'll eat average BBQ.  Once in awhile you'll get a perfectly cooked brisket or pork shoulder or rack of ribs that blows your mind.  That's this place every single time.  I'm not kidding when I say I'd take a half-pound of their moist brisket over a surf and turf from any high end steakhouse if given the choice.  They only cook a given amount a day so make sure to get there early or call ahead to make sure they have what you want.  When a place sells out of food daily...that's a good sign.  They don't compromise their product by squeezing a few more briskets in the smoker.  They have a formula for delicious food and they stick to it.    Some would say the location and shack-like appearence are a downside.  It's out of the way for sure but I find that to be a good thing.  If this place were near my home I'd weigh 400 lbs easily.  If you come here and don't like the food, you just don't like BBQ.  You might like BBQ sauce but you don't like BBQ.  And if you don't like BBQ, I weep for your misfortune.",

    "text": "*A desert landscape at midnight. A few men gather around a campfire seeking its warmth and the rare company of a passing stranger. One man, equally ravaged by the sands of time and the desolate landscape began to speak with just the smallest glimmer of contentment in his voice.*  I had heard for years the ever-so-tantalizing cry of \"melt-in-your-mouth brisket\" sung to me by oh so many men who had come before....men far more accomplished than I. I remember them telling me as a young boy, \"Son, some day you will find your brisket.\" I stared up at them with a gleam in my eyes. An innocent and naive sense of hopefulness filled me to the brink and then poured over the edges of my soul as I thought to myself, \"Yes! I will find my brisket.\"  Many years have come and gone since that time. The months like an ever strengthening gale storm pushing me further and further from my deepest, darkest desire: to find my lost brisket. Lo, the days were long; the minutes past like decades.   Soon my cynicism began to take the best of me. A crusade of the mind against the heart ensued as brisket after brisket entered my gullet and filled my disposition with neglect. Some were flavorful, sure. But none would fulfill the promise my elders had made to me as a young boy.  None, that was, until I found the Texas BBQ House of south central Phoenix. I knew the moment I walked through their doors that I was in for something special, but just what, I could not have told you. I watched a man behind the counter wield his blade flawlessly as a woman kindly prepared a basket with bread and cheesy macaroni. She had potato salad and and sausage and all sorts of other wondrous items. And then the brisket was placed before me. I could see the tenderness of the meat as its juices glistened in the daylight. I saw burnt ends that I could swear were calling for me by name. I thought, \"Could it be? Have all my dreams come True?!\" My heart went aflutter with the still unfulfilled promise of my forefathers.  Finally, the moment had arrived. I prepared a slice of bread with a few slivers of meat, and a helping of barbeque sauce. I slowly bit down as my eyes closed, hoping and preying that the day had finally come. It was like I had died and gone to heaven. I saw Jim Morrison. I went towards the light. Only...when I walked through it, there I was. Sitting at my table, across from my father, with some brisket in a slice of bread that now had a single bite taken from it. I was happy. Down to my core, I was filled with contentment. And I realized at that moment, that I hadn't been searching for that \"melt-in-your-mouth\" brisket all along...I had been searching for myself. And now, I had found it. I had found...me.  *hold for applause*  This is the Q I have been waiting for!!!! Awesome brisket, both the lean and juicy are fantastic. The sausage was the next big winner, followed by the potato salad and then the mac, but actually everything was fantastic. The hot bbq sauce has quite a kick to it, but its a whole-mouth warmth kind of thing so its quite pleasant. Without a doubt the best bbq I've had to date, and I will be back.",

They said it was a great BBQ place in the area and a good option opposed to the standard things around. Let me say, I was impressed and would have gone everyday.   The location is kind of unexpected and the parking lot was small but it is totally worth it. All the staff is friendly and they immediately gave me a piece of meat and their sweet corn to taste before I ordered. They also have good lunch specials available!  I ended up getting the slider lunch combo. The price was good and the food was absolutely amazing. They throw this stuff together so quick and cut the meat in front of you. Served up in a crate it doesn't get any more authentic! A couple of the guys got the pull boy* sandwich and it was SO MUCH FOOD! It looked delicious and I would definitely try it next time.   Overall, great staff and a hidden gem. The BBQ was delicious and served up quick right in front of you. This is a worthwhile stop and, if you're in the area, I bet already you'll be back a second time :)",

Staff is knowledgeable and friendly and there to serve. They do run out of food so get there as early as you can. They also have an app that you can order your food through which gives you a discount plus guarantees your food will be there when you arrive. Lots of other barbecue spots right in the neighborhood that I enjoy as well. Little Miss BBQ and JL Smokehouse. They are all within a mile or two of each other.

    "text": "Smell of oak wood smoke fills Texas BBQ House.  I love the sweet aroma and the nice staff.  This is the friendliest bbq I've been to in Arizona.  While waiting at the counter to order the helpful cashier offers me a piece of beef brisket to help me decide what to get.  It was melt in your mouth tender and full of smoky flavor.  They have 3 different options in the level of moisture/fat in the brisket.  I chose the moist which they were sampling.  The fat rendered down during hours of smoking in their oak pellet filled smoker.  Amazingly moist it's one of the best beef briskets I've had.  Brisket was a deal at $11 for a half pound.  I also tried a $17 beef rib and a half pound of beef brisket for $11.  Beef rib was huge and full of meat.  Very tender beef cooked to medium-medium well.  Loved the flavor from the dry rub and oak smoke.   Service is really good here.  A couple under 18 kids were keeping the place clean and greeting the guests.  I've never been to Texas but if all the bbq is as good as here I'm gonna have to go.",

    "text": "Stopped here for lunch with some co-workers while in town for business due to the stellar reviews on their brisket. I was not disappointed! These folks know how to cook proper Texas brisket and beef ribs. We were given a free sample by the friendly staff while in line and that sold us. I ended up eating half a pound of the fatty brisket, a couple sausage links, and oveer a pound of beef rib. Beef ribs are hard to come by and this one was excellent. The sausage was a bit on the dry side, but the beef was perfectly smoked with a deep smoke ring, flavorful peppery bark, and incredibly moist center.  We tried pulled pork, slaw, pinto beans, and creamed corn as well with tea to drink. The pulled pork was pre-sauced, which seems odd given nothing else was, and was kinda meh. The beans were not a sweet BBQ bean but savory cowboy beans, which I really enjoyed. The slaw and creamed corn tasted like super market generic stuff. Tea was smooth and ok, but lacked in flavor a little.  Staff was friendly and helpful- this is a counter serve place, so not a lot to comment on. The setup is similar to Rudy's where you get everything piled in a crate and then eat on butcher paper. Pricing was fair given the good quality beef- BBQ seems to be somewhat pricey in the Phoenix area. If the sides and sausage were more stand out, this would be a 5 star place!",

The brisket and the ribs are my faves and are smoked to perfection. The quality is consistent which is sometimes hard to achieve at some of these BBQ restaurants.   Sides are all very good, well actually I can't comment directly on the cream of corn because I'm not a fan. ...shudders of the thought..  The BBQ sauces are made in house and compliment the Q to a T!  The restaurant is probably a lil small for the sheer amount a foot traffic during lunch and the parking lot is a bit tight and hard to find a spot during peak times.",

This is THE BEST ribs in town, in the valley, in AZ period.  I was so incredibly impressed I sat in the restuarant with a huge smile on my face. AZ is finally starting to feel like home when you find a stellar place like this.  If you are visiting and want BBQ, go here and only here. Don't waste your time or money anywhere else.  I ended up have the St Louis Ribs... absolutely killer. A huge slab of ribs. Either BBQ sauce compliments them perfectly. The rub is so incredible that you don't even need the bbq sauce. Seriously so good.  After the ribs I sampled the brisket and the turkey.  I felt like I was Guy Fieri on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. I couldn't give the own enough compliments on the food. I was floored at how good everything was.   I also sampled the texas corn and the mac and cheese. 10/10 winners. I couldn't believe that everything I ate there was that damn good.  This place is batting 1.000. They hit it out of the park on every dish I had.  I can't say enough good things.   Keep in mind this place is in the ghetto and is a bit of a dive. But in the persuit of excellent food, that should not deter you one bit. This place is a diamond in the rough.",

The outside appearance is what I would expect for a fantastic BBQ joint... nothing fancy as I pulled into the parking lot.  I walked in to be greeted by a friendly pit master, awesome waitress, a couple of friendly locals and a great Texas menu.  Three meat poor boy on the special board, but a free taste of the moist brisket sealed the deal. Juicy with a nice subtle rub flavor with some mild smoke. I settled on the 1/2lb of Brisket, 1/2 Rack of St. Louis Ribs, Cole Slaw, sweet tea and Texas Dirt Pudding.  The brisket was awesome, juicy and tender with a hint of seasoning. The Ribs were the best St Louis ribs I have had yet. The coleslaw was so fresh and had the perfect flavor and sweetness, as good as it gets and I can only think of one other place in Georgia that came close.I tired the house BBQ sauce (i'll try the spicy next time) and absolutely loved it. The sweet tea was great and three huge glasses.  I asked myself if I should get up and order more??? but the dirt pudding looked like the end of me and hoped that after a excellent meal it would not disappoint. We'll that was almost better than the rest of the meal if the BBQ wasn't so good and in most places it would have been.  Thanks to the friendly owner this place is on my A list when In Phoenix from now on!",

I've never really had genuine before Texas BBQ but if this is it I'm completely sold.   All that aside it's at a great location and the food is high quality. They do not give you plates so be prepared to eat with your hands. I've been here several times after my initial visit and have sampled many of different meats that they offer. I've been impressed everytime and highly recommend Texas BBQ to anyone looking for great tasting meal especially barbeque",

Pulled pork, brisket, and their bbq sauces both sweet and spicy ones are incredible. They deserve the recognition for their A+ flavor in BBQ.   Now for the part that really annoys me...  - Since I've heard about the place 2 months ago, I've been there 8x (roughly 1x/week) because I work so close and love the food. 4 different times I've asked for their WiFi password, and they refuse to give it to me. I ask because I want to do some personal work on my laptop as I'm enjoying my meal. If they accommodated this, I'd easily go here probably 2x a week because of its location, great food, and it allows me to multitask. Since i spend on average $11 per visit, They're losing roughly $44/month of my business, not including the coworkers and friends I bring in with me because they can't accommodate a simple request, or set up a guest wifi.",

Nice smoky flavor with the lean brisket and it was soooo tender.  The sausage tastes like it is made fresh and the pulled pork was tasty, but a little tough. We had the potato salad and banana pudding and both were pretty good, but the banana pudding would have been better with a layer or at least more of the vanilla wafers.  The only bad thing was that they seem to run out of food quickly (This is why I gave it four stars). We tried to pick up some food yesterday and they were completely out of everything. This was at least an hour before they closed. I really wanted some ribs, but today they didn't have any. However, I understand why they do run out. Next time I will call in my order nice and early to make sure I get to try the ribs.",

( with a southern draw of course)   I was very excited to see a BBQ joint in Old town Scottsdale since I am a avid BBQ fan.  I also do a lot of my own meat smoking and love the smells and flavors so I do have some background in it   I was terribly disappointed in this place.  I ordered the 1/2 lb. BBq plate w/ coleslaw and sweet tea   First off, I don't mind the \"pay by pound\" idea in a BBQ joint but I don't like it when BBQ comes drenched in BBQ sauce, and when I mean drenched it was soaked in sauce. I like to put the sauce on myself.  Which leads me to something else I didn't like about this place, the BBQ sauce itself.  WAY to sweet.  To me when  a sauce is to sweet your covering up to much of the meat flavor.  I can put there sauce on a Mc Rib and will taste the same. :) not to knock the famous Mc Rib. There spicy sauce was actually better but since my meat already came slathered in sweet sauce I couldn't use it.   The potato salad and coleslaw seemed mast produced, in other words they bought it from a supplier, I don't know if this is True but the 8 other people I sat with last sunday all said the same thing.  With my 1/2 lb plate came white  \"FRY\"s\" sandwich bread, no joke.   If you wanted to get an actual bun for BBQ sandwiches it was $.99 extra.   Again I'm not sure where these good reviews are coming from but if I were you I would stay away and try another BBQ joint, I'm not going to give any suggestions because then people would think I'm an owner of that \"other\"  joint, I'm just going to suggest that there are way better place then here.   Did I mention the Sweet tea was good?",

    "text": "If you live out here in Phoenix there are a number of good BBQ places, many of which have a strongly Southern focus on BBQ pork, specifically ribs and pulled pork with the meat served already mixed with or covered in sauce. Texas BBQ, at least from my own personal experience (born in Texas and raised there till I was twelve and moved to Hawaii, which has a very different type of BBQ), is generally dry rubbed and smoked and any sauce is put on after you get your meal, at your discretion, and of course, thanks to the bountiful supply of cattle in the early years of the state there is a strong focus on beef BBQ and in addition, thanks to the many German settlers, it is also known for some great smoked sausage (in fact, if you find yourself in Corpus Christie take a drive out and go to Orange Grove, a small town, at least when I was there 20 years ago that is very German and wow, the sausage, but that is another story).  Well, this place, based on the BBQ brisket (always my ultimate test of Texas BBQ) makes some great BBQ and even better, it has the bare bones approach to cost that is standard in many little Texas BBQ joints and many great food hole in the wall places in general. It's not in, to say the least, the fancy part of town, all transactions are done in cash so leave your credit card at home, and the meal is provided on an empty soda crate bottom sort of thing with a piece of butcher paper on it and then the sliced meat of your choice is on another piece of butcher paper and when they ask how many slices of bread you want, and you reply, they reach into the drawer below the cash register, rip open a loaf of sliced Wonder Bread (or the equivalent) and give you that to make the traditional folded sandwich of sliced meat and BBQ sauce on bread. You can also get a sandwich special but I'm a traditionalist, I'll make my own.  In addition, I have an obsession with potato salad at BBQ places (once again, an offshoot of the German influence, I would think, on Texas BBQ cuisine and boy, the potato salad here is classic potato salad. Oh, and to drink, if you are off work, they do have Shiner Bock, in the bottle, along with a number of other beers and if you look up the Shiner brewery website, you will once again, see the strong German influence and one thing that I don't think is German, but definitely Texas, Country Music on the sound track.  Now, for those looking for a luxury experience, you may need to go to Joe's BBQ, which two of my 3 dining companions said they liked better (the whole slices of Wonder Bread did not excite them, but one of the people, along with me, was sold on this place....it is VERY authentic Texas hole-in-the-wall BBQ and it does that well and if you are looking for something other than the no-frills approach to the BBQ experience, then some other place may be more to your liking.",

We walked past it intent on our destination of choice when we we were no longer able to continue, succumbed by the intoxicating smell of smoked meat.  We pulled a quick 180 and ditched our plans in a quest to match a taste to the delicious aromas that were floating around Old Town.  THIS PLACE IS LEGIT.  We ordered the smoked links, smoked turkey, choice brisket, and the fattier cut of brisket (they have 3 choices of cuts for brisket) along with a medium side of creamed corn.  The owner and girls at the counter were throwing samples at us left and right.  Overall we were extremely satisfied, and we almost forgot to bring the promised food back for a coworker we were so preoccupied with stuffing our faces.  As if we had not had our fill we ended the midday feast with Banana Pudding which I have to say was quite awesome as well.    I will go back there tomorrow, eat, and then take a nap on their hickory logs.",

My friend and I shared a 1/2 lb of the pulled pork, which you can get with slices of white bread to make sandwiches, and we ordered creamed corn, green beans, and coleslaw as our sides.  Definitely go for the creamed corn-- creamy and delicious!  The green beans were good, filled with little bits of pork in it, and it had a very subtle kick to it.  The coleslaw was refreshing and tasty, great seasoning.  The pulled pork was delicious, super tender, juicy, and went great with both the sweet and spicy bbq sauces they had to offer.  This place thinks of everything- from ziploc bags for takeout to wet wipes for your bbq sauce stained fingers.  We had wanted to order the ribs, but they had already sold out!!

We appreciate that they don't want food to go to waste at the end of the evening, but we often need to make some substitutions on what we order if we get there after 6 pm. Last night we didn't get there soon enough, and the creamed corn was sold out. Other times it has been the regular sausage links.  Fortunately the other choices are excellent too - we just have to make those minor adjustments, and have a back up plan of what will take the place of the item that has sold out.  This is by far the best BBQ we have found, and we are fortunate to have it in the South Mountain area.",

I ordered us the pulled pork and the serving sizes are very generous and better than most places. The Texas Po' Boy was AMAZING. The price is right for any appetite :)  This place is a must.

Plus the sweet tea.  The tea was very good (though my wife thought it was too sweet...it was just the way I like it).  The brisket, while it had a nice smoke ring, had very little smokey flavor.  And basically no seasoning.  The sausage link was \"just a sausage\".  No smokiness, nothing special.  The pulled pork was drowned in sauce, so I can't say if it was smokey or not.  The flavor of the pork was OK.  Not great.  Just OK.  Two stars is \"I've experienced better\".  And I have.  Dave's BBQ is better.  Rudy's is much better.  And Joe's is vastly better.  Texas BBQ House is not bad, but it's not particularly good either.  I've certainly had worse BBQ, but there is much better available.  So why go here (unless it's just that it's convenient to where you are)?",

    "text": "I've just now come down from the high that Brooks' Place gave me eating brisket in FOR REAL ACTUAL TEXAS (see the review I made just previous to this one), so I actually went searching for a place close to home that laid claim to Texas fame. I was excited to find the Texas BBQ House with such glowing reviews. It's good, it really is. Unfortunately, it ain't quite the same.   Naturally I had the brisket. I mean, it *is* the \"Texas\"  BBQ House, right? It was good. It was tender, it was smoky, it was probably on par with the best I've had in Phoenix (which was Bobby-Q by the way, but that was a long time ago). The problem is, it didn't blow my mind, and as I mentioned, I recently had my mind blown by brisket in Texas. Maybe that isn't fair, I don't know. It is what it is.   So then what we have here is basically \"competent,\" and \"at least as good as anything similar you'll find elsewhere in Phoenix,\" which seems like faint praise. But brisket is hard. I make my own (and I'm no slouch myself) so I know exactly how hard it is. So really, just to say it's as good as I've found in Phoenix is pretty high praise.   The real problem is, little else caught my fancy. I had cole slaw on the side. It was unremarkable - could have been bought at Costco. They have one sauce, it tastes like... nothing. Like Kraft. Boring and unremarkable - and no spicy option.   Add to this that my *first* experience at TBBQH consisted of being turned away by a sign at the door saying \"SOLD OUT\" (at 4PM) and well, you basically get a three-star \"average\" review from me.  I really prefer my competent brisket to be served with mind-blowing sides and sauce(s). Alternatively, you could serve me mind-blowing brisket and merely competent sides and sauce(s) and maybe you'd get up to four stars. Either way, that's not what I got here.  Prices were OK, I suppose, $14 for a half pound of brisket, a couple ounces of cole slaw and a drink. Beef ain't cheap these days, that's for sure.  I do like the way they serve their wares - real deal Texas. Butcher paper, white bread. Plastic forks and knives. The place looks like a dive and is in a crap neighborhood, and honestly, that's all as it should be.",

I got the $10.99 lunch special, pulled pork with a bun, side of mac & cheese and a drink.  Not a bad deal and was filling!! Nice people, basic laid back atmosphere, but clean.  The bun was fresh, the pork tasted great and was cooked and was not fatty, mac & cheese was pretty good, came lots of black pepper in it :), soda was mixed well and tasted good, clean soda machine and amenities table.  I normally would never do a comparison, but since my disappointment at the nearest BBQ shop...............  Texas BBQ House is very good food at a fair price --VS-- The Barbecue Company (a mile away), is grossly overpriced and the food was not so good. (see my review).. I had the same basic meal at each location, the quality definitely goes to the Texas BBQ House, and at 2/3 of the price.........  This is my new go to lunch at my new job. Feeling blessed to have a great place so close...  Give this place a try for sure if you like good BBQ. The guys at the next table were going crazy over the brisket and sausage....",

The mac n cheese was ok.  - The mud pudding was pretty good, but describing it as a blizzard with pudding instead if ice cream made me want to go to DQ.  - Prices are a little high for BBQ in AZ, but on par with what I've experienced in TX.  - Very friendly staff.

I got the Slider Special (3 pulled pork sliders, 1 small side, and a drink). The side of Mac n Cheese was very cheesy & had a touch of pepper. The sandwiches were very good... Pork came slathered in sauce, so take that for what it's worth. The fountain drink was very watered down.   Overall, 4 out of 5 stars for efficient service, good pricing, and tasty food.",

The people here are very friendly and helpful with the menu and will give samples of their BBQ too, if you're on the fence as to what to order. Mike takes a lot of pride in his talent of BBQ and smoked meats and it shows heads and tails above other places in the valley. They chop and slice right in front of you as all of their meats are smoked on site and you can smell that smoky deliciousness! The side dishes are all good : Mac & Cheese; Potato Salad ; Cole Slaw ... And the sauces: I like that they aren't put strait on to the meats and there are options ... lots of options ! If you want sandwiches or sliders , Texas BBQ has those. The Texas Po Boy is filled with 1 lb!!!! of meat : pulled pork, brisket and a link sausage !! You will be full! I love that the place is clean and although it's always busy, as most great places are, they are efficient and friendly ! They have the option of ordering online ... I wish they were open past 7pm, as some nights my husband and I have got home and said , 'mmmm wouldn't Texas BBQ be good...?' and it's closed :-( But , it's a family run business and I get the need for time off... so plan ahead ! Get in here ... this BBQ is a surprise for being in Phoenix! :)",

I have to say, out of all the BBQ stops in the valley, this one is the best there is.  I took a few guys from work here Friday.

Unfortunately we came around 3pm and they told us that their brisket was all sold out for the day but they still had other great meats available. So we tried the sausage links, ribs & pulled pork with potato salad and the mac & cheese.(and sweet teas of course) The food was so good we came back the next morning to get the brisket and we could see why it sells out because it was delicious! Perfect blend of smokey, moist and full of flavor!! The staff is SUPER friendly and make you feel very welcome. We will definitely be back again and again and again.......",

    "text": "Ill start this out by sounding terribly biased, and just get it out of the way. I am one of their original staff members, from years ago. And while I was only there a year (and have been gone several now) I still am a fan, and keep in touch with the guys. At one point in my life, I was a vegetarian (gasp). How I ended up working at a bbq joint, God only knows. But I did, and yes I ate the food ALL the time. I personally prefer to get the turkey, and the jalapeno sausage. I don't eat ribs, never tried them, so I cant comment on them. The cream corn was my favorite side, although the beans are suuuuuuper yummy as well. If you try a dessert, the banana pudding is the way to go. You'll want more than one cup of it! Dale and Mike have been there since day one, and I respect them as owners, and how they interact with their customers. One day many months ago I ended up out west, when the Rudys in Goodyear opened. Although I felt like I was cheating, I needed to compare. That being said, although Rudy's is a more known facility, and larger, it just wasn't the same. I still prefer Texas BBQ House. The hospitality and pricing are better, and they are smack in the middle of the valley. To the people complaining about them running out of items, these meats take hours and hours to prepare, I would suggest calling ahead if its that big of a deal. If you haven't been to this place, its well worth the visit. And yes, you'll be in Cowboys Country :)",

A couple previous restaraunts were in the same location and had to close shop. To put it simply, I hope this place does not go anywhere. The beef brisket is great. Worth 4 stars itself. Barbecue sauce is on the sweet side but very tasty. Most meats are sold by weight. You have to arrive early if you want the moist brisket as it sells out early. The sides are not too much to brag about. Simple cream corn and baked beans are good, coleslaw is made fresh as I saw them preparing it in the kitchen, potato salad tastes as if it is purchased pre made.  I have eaten here about a dozen times and it always has good food. I however found another place that has a better smoke flavor to their brisket. Rudy's. Rudy's uses a real wood fired Oyler Smoker that produces a consistantly better flavor than Texas BBQ House. I will still eat here when I am in the area but if I had to choose, I am going to Rudy's as both places are the same distance from where I live.",

They slice up the Q right there at the counter, weigh your portion and wrap it to go or serve it up on butcher paper.  I chose the \"moist\" brisket, regular sausage and St Louis style ribs.  The brisket was very tender and juicy, some of the best I have had anywhere.  The sausage was also very good.  The ribs were \"fall off the bone\" tender.  The guys included some of their home made BBQ sauce and it was excellent with everything.

    "text": "I am a native Texan, and felt that Phoenix has been definitely lacking in the BBQ area.... not anymore! This brisket is awesome! So flavorful... don't need the sauce, just the way it should be. My only complaint is that they ran out of food! My fault for getting there at the end of the day. Also, proves that the food is good because they are selling out! I will be a repeat customer, for sure! The owner came by and thanked us for our business, and the other employee were friendly, too. Great experience, even better food!",

Albeit this place is smack dab in the ghetto but when you walk inside the atmosphere is very rodeo-ish.  The guys behind the counter are extremely friendly they even offer samples. MAKE SURE TO BRING CASH!!!! I hate it when restaurants make you pay cash, but it does keep the operating cost down for small business owners. On the bright side there is an ATM in the store so don't worry if you forget to bring cash. Let's get down to the star of the show; the MEAT! I had the Brisket and the Jalapeno Sausage both were served in meat paper not plates. The flavors were fully developed and easy to chew. For sides I had the Potato Salad which was standard and the Mac & Cheese which was nice and cheesy. It is a bit expensive but what good BBQ isn't. This place sells the items ala carte with the exception of the daily special. I will be back for more! Oh yeah, the BBQ sauce was served on the side and was a nice touch to all of the food",

    "text": "We recently moved to the Phoenix area from San Diego and have been in search of good BBQ.  Seems like most places add smoke flavoring which does not taste good to me.  Texas BBQ House does not add smoke!  That lets the flavor of their meat speak for itself.  And boy does it ever.  This is THE best BBQ.  I can't decide between the cutter's choice brisket and the pulled pork as my favorite.  They are both so good!  Hands down the best side dish is the creamed corn.  As the very helpful employee said, \"This is not your mama's creamed corn!\"  It is unbelievably delicious.  Highly recommend this restaurant!",

    "text": "went in today 2/12/13 had ordered mac n cheese, cutters choice brisket, pulled pork, and pork spare ribs.   First and for most I went in around 1050-11am and didn't eat until just after 1130 since I was waiting for my wife to go on her lunch break (shes a teacher in the area).  mac n cheese: warm and filling with a great flavor not to much of anything though i could have used a little more pepper in mine that is a personal preference.  Cutters choice: With a nice thick smoke ring and a nice flavor profile the cut melted in my mouth. my wife and I made it into sandwiches and with a small amount of there spicy BBQ sauce I devoured this great meat.  pork spare ribs: now let me start off by saying that Ribs are my personal choice in choosing a meat to smoke and i like mine sweet. But I had to keep in my mind open. The meat had no pull which is something to look for in a good rib. The ribs had a good flavor with the major flavor in mine seemed to be pepper but man let me tell you that these were on point. If you understand Texas BBQ you know that it rarely comes with a BBQ sauce which was the case her and honestly it didn't need it though some may say it did.   At this point in our meal I was full and was unable to get and of the pulled pork but my wife said she enjoyed it with just a little of the original BBQ sauce.   I highly recommend this place i know i will be back as long as they maintain the Q.  David Pepiton 31bravo AZ BBQ member  PS i will update my review when i have some more of the different cuts of meat.",

I never thought I'd find a place that could even come close to The Salt Lick or The County Line in the Austin area, but folks, this is the real deal. These boys know how to whip up a batch of Texas best vittles this side of El Paso! Don't go gettin' all dressed up for this one, 'cuz you are going to be wearing (and bringing) some of this home! The down home atmosphere and Shiner Bock on ice is just the start, and the finish with some pecan pie makes it all come together at the end! Great place to take the family, friends and their families, too!",

    "text": "We decided to have Texas BBQ prepare the food for our work team Holiday Party.  We figured it would be good but had no previous experience.  All I can say is WOW!!!  Every aspect of the meal was incredible.  The folks on the other end of the phone were helpful, pleasant,  and knew their product!  They gave us a \"smokin' deal\" (no pun intended).  The delivery and set up was right on time to the minute.  We had not even expected delivery.  The food was amazing!  Everyone raved.  The brisket was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  It fell apart when the fork touched it.  The pork loin was moist and succulent.  The smoke was sweet and not harsh or overpowering.  All of the sides; cowboy beans, slaw, and potato salad were fresh and homemade with just the right kick.  Also featured was one of the best BBQ sauces I have had to date.  I am a former professional chef/caterer, working in education.  Believe me, I would not take the time to write this glowing review unless all of the components lined up right:  promises kept, food well prepared; clean, ample, and delicious, and great value!  Bravo Texas BBQ!!  You have not heard the last of me!",

Texas BBQ House has the best meats and sides and for me,my wife and my 2 kids to eat was half the price of other restaraunts. I had the chicken(the meat just falls offf the bone!) My wife had the moist brisket(superb) my boys had the ribs and sausage.  The ribs r huge and delicious. Sausage was amazing.  The beans and the creamed corn are to die for.  I found my BBQ place! Like their sign says \"That's how we do it son!\"",
