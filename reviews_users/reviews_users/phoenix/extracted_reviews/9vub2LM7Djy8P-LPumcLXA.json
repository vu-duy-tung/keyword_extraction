I had never had either of the last two options so I wanted to venture out. I told the girl taking the order to surprise me and make the decision for me (she looked kind of shocked when I told her this but I told her I know what both are and I can't make up my mind on which option to try first so she can make it for me). My two tacos came and she ordered me the Lengua. I started with that and it just melted in my mouth! It was fantastic! I told her that her choice was awesome and she said it was her favorite one. Next I ate the Taco Chiwas and again that was another good choice. I cannot wait to go back and now try the Tripas and other items!",

    "text": "I first encountered the staff of Tacos Chiwas not long ago at the Devour Culinary Festival.  At that event, Tacos Chiwas and Bitter & Twisted Cocktail Parlor teamed up to make what was effectively a Mexican Sushi dish.  Basically seasoned ground beef and chimichurri rolled up and served with soy sauce.  It was a surprisingly delicious hybrid and was a big hit at the festival.  While I had no illusions about finding such a dish at Tacos Chiwas' flagship operation, I was nevertheless interested in taking a crack at their menu.  Then a crack of a different kind, the crack of shattered windows and broken registers that only jerks make.  Some world class jackasses made off with thousands of dollars during a late night robbery of Chiwas' main location.  No one was hurt, but the damage and lost cash was a nasty blow to owners Armando Hernandez and Nadia Holguin.  Upon hearing the news of the robbery from the Phoenix New Times, I decided Monday after work was as good a time as any to make my first visit and help out by enjoying a good meal here.  Located in an old drive thru restaurant on McDowell Road just west of the 51 freeway, Chiwas converted this old building into a brick and mortar taco stand.  The setup is simple and no frills with picnic table seating outside, while inside is a mix of regular tables and chairs as well as some booth seating.  Altogether I'd guess the place can fit about 50-60 at a time.  Brown walls, brown seating, brown tile, you get the idea.  Order up front and they bring out the good stuff to your table.  The menu includes much of what you'd expect to find at any taco stand with taco offerings including carne asada (beef), pastor (pork), and pollo (chicken).  Burrito offerings are also in abundance with various breakfast and lunch burrito options.  Being a first timer, I decided to go with a mix of items both familiar and unfamiliar.  First item was the Taco Chiwas, the restaurant's own housemade creation.  Beef, ham, cheese, jalapeno, and hatch chiles.  Second, a Picadillo Gordita.  Ground beef, carrots, and potatoes in what essentially looks like an open faced papusa.  Third, a cup of their Frijoles Charros.  A traditional Mexican bean soup with beans, ham, veggies, as well as some onion, garlic and bacon.  Lastly, Horchata.  Because...well...no Mexican meal is complete without a tall glass of Horchata (at least in my opinion).  Total cost for all of this including tax?  Just $11.  I gotta say the Picadillo Gordita really stood out for me.  It hit a surprisingly savory note for me.  I think it was the spices they used plus the texture of the bread.  The Taco Chiwas was also quite good, and not nearly as spicy as I'd expected.  Certainly had some heat, but not overpowering.  The soup came to my table plenty hot, but not at all spicy.  A good hearty mix of meats and beans in a tasty broth.  Honestly the Horchata was probably the only real disappointment for me as it was a little flat without much in the way of that cinnamon note I always love.  All in all though, a good meal and a good value.  Chiwas is an ideal spot for a late breakfast or lunch.  The food is cheap and the service is quick for those on the go.  I have no idea what prompted those robbers to target this place, but based on the turnout I saw today, Chiwas isn't going anywhere.  Local owners serving good food at a price point accessible to pretty much anyone.  I'll be back and I'll be excited to see what Armando and Nadia come up with at next year's Devour.",

I mainly used the tacos as a means to transport the absolutely amazing condiments to my mouth.  Tacos Chiwas has a large case of different types of salsa and veggies to add to your tacos.  There is a light green salsa that tastes like buttermilk and cilantro.  It's probably not actually made of buttermilk and cilantro, but it's incredible, and I drenched all my food in it.  I also drank it straight from the provided cup and made \"tacos\" out of cucumbers with grilled onions inside and covered in the buttermilk/cilantro sauce.  All in all, this is probably my favorite new taco place in Phoenix.",

For example, my hubby likes extra onions on everything, try to ask for that & u get answers like 'umm I'm not sure' , 'ummm we don't do extra' , 'ummm i guess I could ask'!! Seriously irritating! We go to chiwas nearly 3-4/wk and the service keeps getting worse! Last week I (a customer) helped the customer in front of me out to her car w her catering order because the girl at the counter couldn't be bothered!?!?   Also consistency is a huge issue, from order to order the exact same items vary immensely - great many times, passable others. It's a crap shoot!  Seriously wth do I spend my $$ here! Armando if you are reading this - please instill some service & consistency standards in your staff to accompany your delish food!!!!",

While it is relatively easy to make good carne asda, pollo, or pastor tacos, tripa is somewhat tricky in my experience - it has to be done really right or it will have a somewhat funky flavor. Tacos chiwas makes tacos de tripa really, really well: the tripa is crispy and oh-so tasty. It is the main reason I come to this place. All their other tacos are good, but the tripa is ambrosia for me. The salsa/fixins bar is small but sufficient and I like that they offer sauteed onions, my favorite topping. I love their horchata - refreshing, almondy, and not too sweet. For the quality of the food, the prices are good. Some time in the future I'll try their beans that everyone has been raving about, but in the meantime I'll be returning because I'm drawn by the siren song of their tacos de tripa.",

I sent my friend a picture of my lunch...and she texted back, \"Are you in Mexico again?\"...because that's how amazing this place is.  So my chubby friend and I cyber stalked Tacos Chiwas from afar, and as soon as our plane landed, we jumped in our rented clown car and literally raced to try it out. OMG. It did not disappoint.  Like at all.  As a matter of fact, half of the time we were in Sedona, we were plotting our departure time to ensure that we would have time to pick up another snack before getting on the plane.  Ahem. On to the food. I had tacos de tripa, lengua, calabacitas, barbacoa and one al pastor.  All heavenly, but the lengua was my favorite!   So so so tender and flavorful. My friend loved his crispy tripas.  They're all amazing. Because I'm a pig, I also tried a rajas gordita.  Bad idea. If you want to continue fitting in your clothes, remain on a diet or avoid obesity, don't start eating these because it was literally heavenly and so so so delicious. Horchata was on point too.  Salsa? So hot I was crying. Just the way I love it; hot yet still with flavor. Are you understanding how much I loved this place?  My friend and I nearly missed our flight because not coming back here was NOT an option. And yes, I straight up inhaled my tacos and gorditas right in the airport, like a shameless pig. Because it's good stuff y'all. Go there. And go hungry. Tacos Chiwas...I'm a forever fan!",

Its not worth $2.50 at all (4 inch total length of the corn tortilla. And its only one tortilla). My bacon egg breakfast burrito was on a 10 inch store bought tortilla and for $5.00 was definitely not worth it, i should have gone to Fillibertos for at least 15 inch tortilla with lots of egg filling. I'm going to Tacos Mich for the $.75 tacos on Wednesday at 16th st and McDowell or any night at 18th st and McDowell (corner market) for $1.00 tacos in the evening and they are great with a lot of meat. Sorry but you need to step and give better portions, your flavor won't keep you in business, its not that good.",

It is a dish that is worth traveling here to try.  The Gorditas were another standout dish. Light and fluffy, with a crisp outer shell.   I wasn't as blown away by the tacos as everyone else is. It might have just been a little over hyped for me. They are delicious tacos, in firm but pillowy homemade tortillas. They didn't change my life like the Frijoles, but if I was local I'd be back for more again and again. I will say the Tacos Chiwas needs more cheese and then it needs to be melted!

I got to work & took my first bite & it was so fresh & tasty I had to write a review. I had the Picadillo burrito with onions & it's my new spot since it's right down the street from work.  P.S.

However, I found this place to be pretty overpriced. We spent $30 on 6 street tacos, beans and horchata, where as you can get similar quality tacos and horchata from Los Taquitos for much less. That's my only complaint besides the fact that this restaurant does not serve rice. I'd eat at Tacos Chiwas again, but might pre-game with an appetizer elsewhere.",

The place is called TACOS chiwas, so forgive me for primarily trying out just the tacos. If they were called Burritos chiwas, then i would have went a different direction, but back on topic.   I tried out a taco of each variety of their meats. In comparison to their competition their tacos sizes were small, and their prices trended higher.  While most of their meats were kinda bland, the common factor was they were all watery (not to be confused with juicy).   The bean (and ham & hot dog) soup was actually kinda gross. Its like bean flavored water with floating bits of poverty meat scraps.   For being a small taco stand it was nice that they serve beer, alcohol always comes in handy to rescue an average meal.",

Whether or not She was abandoned amongst wolves as a toddler or...she has a face forward dislike for gabachos, I cannot be certain of either. I would like to compliment the red sauce but the heartburn makes her face reappear in the sad recollections as I lay dying from tacos chiwas. The recent gabacho consumption of the well marketed Taco Shop is to be appreciated. Appreciate it as much as the gloomy Skies. I have certainly noticed a degradation of the walls and the trim and the tables and the floors and the accouterments about the place. Once upon a time I went to tacos chiwas and thought it was -1 against its closest Mexicano of Rivals in South and West Phoenix. But now I realize that they have capitalized on a sentiment that runs deep in the office folk that work in Central Phoenix slightly off to the east. They want tacos they want them fast and they want to glare at your woman because it's the last thing that's walked in on boots that are made of anything that appeared here edible in a long time as you drag your bags of saddness out of your office coup. I can't blame you for your clientele but I can blame you for the barbacoa that tasted more like machaca from a decade ago that had been stepped on with the smelly feet of the vagrants in the parking lot. And as I took my first swallow I realize that the fat man with the bald head and the girl that was once the daughter of a lobo all stood witnessing me take my worst bite of anything that McDowell and 20th Street has to offer.",

If you know anything about McDowell Rd, it has great Mexican food up and down its long stretch of road. This place is a nice welcome addition to some of Arizona's great food from across the border. It was started by a couple from Chihuahua, Mexico who wanted to bring their flavors from home to the Valley. The outside doesn't look like much, but don't let that fool you. This place serves up some top-notch street tacos. Food is ordered at the counter and you have a choice to dine inside or on their patio. They have a nice variety of slow simmering meats to choose from (including lengua (beef tongue) and tripe) that are packed into fresh corn tortillas. I went for the asada, pastor and the signature taco chiwas (a combination of beef, ham, cheese, Hatch chiles and jalapenos). I seriously felt like I was chilling on some beach in Mexico putting down some buck street tacos. The meat is so tender and juicy. They have a nice condiment bar that you can get sides of salsa, guac, radishes and chilis to add to your meal. One thing I love about this place is the prices are very reasonable. Some of these new Americanized joints way overcharge for their tacos. You can get a full meal for under $10 here. I highly recommend getting their bean soup on the side - super good! Also on their menu are burritos, flour gorditas and breakfast (served 10am - noon).",

I will keep on recommending and taking my friends and family. Tacos Chiwas you're doing an excellent job!   P.s. Tortillas recien hechesitas (freshly made tortillas). Can't beat that!",

The space is cute and the smell of the tamales was mouth watering. I tried their special coffee that's made with cinnamon and piloncillo syrup....It was good, but not what I expected as it isn't milk based....More like cinnamon -y coffee. Anyway, the real stars here are the tamales.... I tried the red chili tamale and it was pretty legit....Also, it was priced at 2.50, which is super cheap compared to most restaurants. I'll be back!",

Parking lot is limited and small, and I didn't see any other alternatives if the lot was full.  The restaurant does offer drive through service.  The inside of the restaurant is also on the small side (-1).  If the place was full, I'm not sure where one would eat if they were dining in.  Staff were friendly and helpful with menu items and ordering.  The menu was conveniently located above the cashier and on the table by the cashier. The one on the table offered more explanations of the menu items versus the menu above.  I ordered three tacos and, sadly, they were very underwhelming - very small and under filled (-1).  It simply wasn't filling to consume just those 3 tacos for dinner.  The filling for the tacos also appeared uninspiring and very dry.  Don't get me wrong, the tacos were tasty.  The sauce station was not as varied or extensive as I've seen at some other places. Probably won't return based on my dissatisfaction with their tacos.",

I cant tell you how many times we have driven past this place with little consideration. Non the less we wanted some good Mexican food and ended up wanting to give it a try.  The staff here is incredibly nice and super polite. Every single person there, from the cashier to the cooks. We ordered the tacos linguas, tacos chiwas , quesadilla and the frijoles charros . ALL were fantastic but my ultimate favorite was the linguas taco. Holy goodness were they outstanding. We went back for seconds and if we hadn't been so full we would have gone for thirds. We are definitely going back and if you haven't gone yet and are debating, you should absolutely 100% go. You won't regret it.",

Highly recommend which I believe to be the highlight of their taco lineup the \"Chiwas taco\".(combination of meats).  A close second would be their Carne Asada taco,(meat prepared medium rare~ LOVE IT) which I personally believe could benefit from some avocado based salsa option but still excellent with out.    Tacos are smaller, but plenty of meat and garnish with each one.  I personally would recommend 6-7 tacos to be satisfied.   Small place , attentive staff, could also benefit from a drive thru.   Thank you and we'll be back with some friends!",

Food: Between the three of us, we ordered three burritos, a taco, a gordita, and a Mexican coke. I ordered the carne asada burrito and it was phenomenal. Get some of the sauteed onions that are available on the side counter and add them to the mix. It gives an almost Korean BBQ taste to the burrito. The portions aren't your gigantic Chipotle style sizes, but one was perfect for me.   The tacos looked really good as well, so I'll have to try them next time.   Service: no problems here. You order at the counter and they come and find you.   Seating: lots of seating both inside and out.   Come here. It's in a little sketchy of a neighborhood, but the good ones always are.",

The place didn't scream clean and sanitary, but I decided to give it a shot anyway. I kept it simple 3 chicken tacos and 1 cheese quesadilla.   Waited about 5 minutes with thoughts of delicious tacos dancing through my head. Couldn't wait to pick up the first one and bite into a juicy, perfectly seasoned taquito, but alas, it did not pan out this way.   I got my order and was already disappointed. I knew what I was in for. The chicken was chopped, dry and lacking flavor. The tortilla were on the drier side. I added some of their green mild salsa, then the red spicy one and finally some of their guacamole sauce, but unfortunately, these tacos could not be saved :(   I bit into my quesadilla and it had a nice taste on the flour tortilla, but the cheese was dreadful. It's that really cheap cheese that looks rubbery and lacks flavor.  The best part of my meal was the Mandarin Jarrito which I didn't even finish.  How any can say this place is better than Los Taquitos or Tacos Los Yaqui needs to have tastebud surgery STAT!  To be fair, as I mentioned before, I only got the chicken tacos and a plain quesadilla - but jeez, if you can't make those simple things taste great then I have doubts about the rest of the menu items. I wouldn't recommend and won't return.",

There are zero sides on the menu besides beans... which was weird but whatever. Then I was like ok chips and salsa will do... but they didn't have any? Now I'm like ok these tacos must be the greatest thing on earth if that's all you can get besides a burrito or quesadilla. Tacos came out and they were such a miss. Again feel awful for writing this but seriously? Tacos Sahuaro is by far the best taco place around if you're looking for a taco fix.",

I say a sip cause there was so much ice in my drink that there was only room for a sip of a very tasty Jamaica. But! there's always a but to these reviews. But the corn tortillas were mushy and lukewarm! Tortillas are essential to good tacos! The meats, the fillings alone don't make a taco, you need a good tortilla to back it up! Ideally you have home hand made tortillas but not everyone is able to provide them I understand! At the very least give me a HOT tortilla.   I give them 2 stars for their meats otherwise known as an 'incomplete taco.'  I give them 1 star for the Jamaica, you give me more Jamaica I give you more stars! Comprendes Mendez?  Chiwas please pay more attention to your tortillas!  In this election year I vote for more HOT tortillas and less COLD ice!  Thank you, Harry S",

It was pretty busy but there was only one person ahead of us in line so no worries. We put in our order - 3 tacos each - me: chiwas, carnitas, carne asada. Him: carnitas, al pastor, carne asada. We grab the last open table and settle in.   Fast forward to 35 minutes later when we STILL had NO tacos! We went up to complain and said it would be right out. It still took a few more minutes but finally they brought our food. Not sure what took so long but that's way too long for 6 little tacos.  That being said, they were very good. My favorite was the chiwas followed by the carnitas. The asada was just okay IMO. The meat was a little too chewy. The tortillas are really good and don't fall apart like a lot of other places. The tacos are small, street size, so we ended up getting a quesadilla too. That came out quickly and was really good.  I will probably give them another shot since the food was good. Since I don't see a lot of mentions of wait times I'm gonna say it was a fluke and something got messed up. But I might bring a back up snack with me just in case.",

Yea this place is pretty good but not as good as you may expect if your visiting the place solely based on the yelp reviews. The place is pretty small so good luck getting a empty table to eat at.  The horchata was pretty darn good, its one of those items that has one name but many different ways it can taste, not all of them are good. I tried one of my girlfriends al pastor tacos and it was ok. The best one I had was the tripa taco, really good flavor. Also tried the chiwa taco and a barbacoa taco. Their salsas definitely helped mask the dryness of the al pastor and barbacoa and added a nice kick of heat into the tacos, I started to break a little sweat after the 4th taco. I also like that the toppings on the taco are determined by what meat you picked. And for anybody that's not familiar with Mexican meat and names there's a handy menu at the front desk that breaks down the names and what the taco will consist of. Will be back for more tripa tacos and to try the others I didn't get to.",

This (former Dairy Queen?) has so many bars on the windows you may feel like you're in (or have a flashback to when you were in) the mess hall at San Quentin (Sheriff Joe Would stick you in a tent city).  Actually - the interior is very clean, the tables and chairs are new, the service provided is very nice - plus (bonus) after lunch you are not limited to 30 minutes of rec time per day in the yard.  The food is damn good.  Small portions for small prices.  Order at the counter and then take a seat in the dining area.  We tried the picadillo and rajas gorditas as well as the standard beef and chicken tacos.  Authentic.  Tasty.  But not mind-blowing...  The condiment bar es muy bueno.  The chunky salsa verde is the shining star, and their runny guacamole sauce is similar to that at El Guero Canelo.  But I thought the red sauce tasted too much of the same flavor as a can of El Pato sauce, and they slice the fresh radishes waaay too thin (like thinner than potato chip thin).  And what's up with served ice cold charred serranos?  If you want 5 stars from me those roasted peppers should be roasted daily and served warm!  This is a fine 4 star addition to the local area and, like most parolees from the big house, we will be back!!",

    "text": "Last night I got incredibly hungry. After a quick scan of the local offerings open around 8:30 pm, I narrowed my search to \"tacos\" and hit return. I then erased that search and typed in \"bars\" but quickly changed my mind back to tacos...  Now, I'm pretty well versed in what a great taco should be. I've traveled quite a bit in my day. (At 33 I feel I'm qualified to now say that, and always wanted to position it well in a sentence)   The Phoenix area, of which I am native to, has some of the best. I'm not saying it is the best. But it is definitely in the conversation.   Until last night, the best tacos I have ever eaten were from a street side cart while returning back to the US from Tijuana Mx. I think I paid 50 for two.   Enough background. Let's get to the nitty gritty.   I first noticed the gentleman manning the cook top flipping what appeared to be hand made corn tortillas. Always a good sign that you're in for a great experience. The second observation I made was the condiment stand in the corner, appetite whet. Finally, a tale tale sign of a great restaurant is a minimal, focused menu. Check and check.   It is my opinion that carne asada tacos are not the best option. Sure I like them. Sure they are good. However when it comes to flavor, lengua and cabeza are my personal favorites.   That being said, I ordered \"queiro un taco de asada, uno de pastor, y una de lengua o y para tomar coca en botella\"   I order this to go. But during my wait I saw a guy wearing a sombrero with a flowing ponytail looking like he was in 7th heaven while eating his order. A life decision was made here.   Bag in hand I hit the condiment section. Loaded up on jalapenos torreados salsa verde and guacamole salsa. Sat out front in the patio and began to enjoy.   Carne asada :)) Pastor :))) Lengua :))))))))))))  If you've come this far. Just go. Seriously. Five stars. My only regret is there aren't more stars to give.",

    "text": "Small hole in the wall restaurant with about 8 tables, was told the owner was a former cook at Pizzeria Bianco for many years until he decided to open his own restaurant.   Ordered the Taco Chiwas, Carnitas Tacos, Asada Burrito and the Deshebrada Verde Gordita which were all tasty.  The Tacos Chiwas has Beef, Ham, Cheese, Jalepeno and Hatch Chilis in a street taco size entree which I preferred and would recommend. Not too spicy, but good flavor, if the entree is named after the restaurant it better live up as the premeir dish which it was.  The Carnitas Tacos were good with the shredded pork and flavorful, would like to go back and try a few more of the others like the Asada, Pastor, Chicken or Beef Tongue.  The Asada Burrito was pretty good but the beef was slightly on the over cooked but had a pico sauce with cilantro which gave it a good fresh mix, pretty much all the offerrings of tacos can be found with a burrtio and some more. BTW the tortillas are very good.  The Deshebrada Verde Gordita which is shredded beef in a green sauce was good and in a soft shell, they do offer many other varieties so you can decide which flavor is best for you.  They do offer Breakfast Burritos, Quesidillas and a Bean Soup (Frijoles Charros) along with Horchatta and a Jamaica Drink, but that is for another time.  I ennjoyed their food and will come back to try the other side of the menu.",

    "text": "Tacos Chiwas knocks it out of the park.  I visited Tacos Chiwas after reading reviews and viewing pictures from a fellow yelper. Tacos Chiwas is a type of no-frills restaurant  that you turn to when you know exactly what you want. So if what you want is piles of meat, cradled inside steaming hot corn tortillas, you need to go to Tacos Chiwas, because the folks at Tacos Chiwas, knock taco making out of the park.  Tacos Chiwas is a family owned business that has a warm and welcoming vibe, which is always a plus. However, the real plus to Tacos Chiwas is the quality of the food, service, and products. So if you were under the impression that tacos had to be complicated, with complex sauces, lots of  garnish, served on fancy plates, think again.  On my first visit to Tacos Chiwas I had the Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos. The meat in these tacos was tender, flavorful, and practically melted in my mouth. The Carne Asada Taco is stuffed with bubbling, juicy bits of lightly marinated skirt steak, nestled in a warm homemade tortilla, delicious doesn't begin to describe the Carne Asada Taco. However, I couldn't possibly overlook the Al Pastor with its sweet meat, topped with onions and cilantro, so flavorful, moist, and delicious, I could have ate a dozen.   I am looking forward to my next visit to Tacos Chiwas, I can't want to try everything. I can't say enough about Tacos Chiwas, if you want delicious tacos, burittos, gorditas, frijoles, rice  with great service and local flavors go to Tacos Chiwas.",

They do a small number of things, and they do them well. Tacos are all excellent (there's even a vegetarian option- calabacitas), the gorditas are delicious (choice of red or green sauce. The red is divine), but for me, the Pastor Burrito was life changing. Perfect blend of flavorful and spicy, the flour tortilla holds up to the filling but still melts in your mouth, and it's large enough for a meal. Sooooo good! I even catered a party for 40 people with them recently. There is no specific catering menu- I simply ordered a metric ton of tacos & quesadillas, gave them a few days notice, and paid in advance. The service was wonderful, and guests raved about the food. Not a single taco was spared. If you're looking for a hole in the wall gem, this is it.",

And while we were waiting, the owner (a guy) came out of the kitchen to talk to the other people sitting in the dining room. I know he was an owner b/c he mentioned it a few times. He chatted with them for about 25 minutes but never acknowledged my daughter and me. $20 for two average size burritos and a horchata isn't too bad but overall just nothing special. Probably won't go back.  The restaurant itself was OK. Some people might be freaked out by the bars on the window but they're not really a big deal. The parking is tight but it works out OK.

I've tried many tacos in my life but these tacos were not extraordinary in any way. I just thought with the hype on the streets i thought that they would be spectacular. Tacos were small and overpriced and had a undescribable spice that I've never had in my life. The thing that really threw me off were the charro beans. I love beans, I love chicharones and beans but I don't like chopped up hot dog in my beans. I can tell you that my family was from Chihuahua Mexico and I've never had hot dogs in my beans.  I guess this is just a heads up if you don't like hot dogs in your beans probably skip the charros.",

    "text": "So I was really hoping this joint would have been a home run. The food IS good however it is OVER PRICED! The portions are very small as if for a small child. We ordered 6 tacos at $2.50 each, 2 veggie gorditas at $3.25 each and an asada quesadilla at $6.00 (for adding a small scoop of meat!). The bottled Jarritos were also pricey at $2.50 a pop.   The female cashier gave my husband attitude & was more concerned with ensuring the Closed sign was hung up with 30 minutes to spare. The place was very small & beyond FILTHY. I came across 4 vacant tables, each with leftover food and spilled salsa. The chairs and floor were just as bad that I became grossed out so we selected one of the 'less than dirtier' tables. A young male waiter came by to deliver a patron's food so I politely asked if he could have someone clean my table. He said sure and told an older gentleman that had been restocking their joke of a salsa bar to wipe down all the tables. I kid you not, the older gentleman glanced at the tables and simply walked away without ever returning! When my husband finally sat down he looked at the dirty place with disgust. He got up and asked the female cashier to have someone clean our table. The same young male waiter that had been delivering the food somewhat cleaned the table saying, \"Sorry man, we've been busy.\" Guess what dude, that's great but clean your damn tables. Basic common sense make great food, provide excellent customer service and tidy up your dining area ESPECIALLY when crowded.   Now here's the kicker, the restroom was even worse because it had NO toilet paper, seat covers or hand soap! I decided to \"hold it\" and leave ASAP.   We are not returning any time soon so to the owners pay closer attention to detail, train your staff to restock the bathroom and by all means CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN the dining area. I can only imagine how the kitchen must be.",

Like other Yelpers have said, it's in a quite unassuming small space off the 51 and McDowell. Forewarning, parking is definitely a premium.   The menu is simple and perfect- tacos, burritos, quesadillas, horchata and a pretty good salsa/toppings bar. Unfortunately when I came with friends they were out of sauteed onions, but the salsas were a-plenty. Just maybe a little too spicy for my pref. Because I had worked out before, I was uber hungry and easily ate 5 tacos.  With #BestWeatherEverSeason upon us, we sat outside on one of their big patio tables. All but a few went with a variety of tacos. The consensus for favorites were Tacos Chiwas & Lengua. I love cabeza tacos, so one of my girlfriends convinced me I would probably like Lengua equally. And actually it's much better especially at Tacos Chiwas! The Al Pastor was ok, just a little too heated spicy for personal pref. Add in a large $3 horchata and it was a fab meal. I basically spent $15 and left a full and happy taco-lover.",

    "text": "We originally stopped by Tacos Chiwas after they recently opened - thanks to a nice Instagram plug by the owner's former employer, famed-chef Chris Bianco. Back then, parking was easy and lines were short. Since then, we've visited several other times and watched their popularity quickly grow.  Arguably, their best option is clearly the chiwas taco. It consists of beef, ham, cheese, jalapeno and chiles. Their other tacos are mostly subjective based on personal taste. My girlfriend and I both agree that their tacos are good, but describing them as being leagues above many of the other reputable joints in Phoenix is a bit of an overstatement. Unfortunately, tripas and lengua scare the hell out of me, so I can't really provide an opinion on those until I grow some huevos.  Order the bean soup as a side. It's extremely meaty and great quality for the price you pay. I'm also a big fan of their no-nonsense asadero quesadilla, which I've ordered on both occasions. Wash everything down with a Mexican Coke and you're good to go!  One article I read described Chiwas as being a \"local hangout\" for chefs in the Valley. During our last visit, I fully expected to see Chris Bianco, Kevin Binkley, and Doug Robson all shooting the breeze, sharing a plate full of a dozen rajas gorditas. Unfortunately, I just saw what looked like regulars.  Although I do question if the hype is a bit too high, I strongly feel that Chiwas is fully deserving of their growing success.  Highly recommended!",

I had a language burrito and I'm mad I spent so much here and then ended up going to another place with my friend down the street and realized my poor decision even more. I will not be back. This is definitely geared towards Americans who like extremely bland food. A little salt and pepper would have made it tons better and I hate salt on my food! This is a hard pass.",

The menu has the basics .. tacos, gorditas, quesadillas & burritos.. lots of meat options..   On today's visit I had the carnitas & al pastor tacos served on corn tortillas.. tacos are on the smaller side.. but the flavors were spot on .. meat is tender and flavorful.. very good..   and the rajas gordita (because it sounded delicious) .. the gordita is stuffed with roasted hatch chilis, jalapenos & white asadero cheese (the kind that melts into gooey cheese .. used in quesadillas) .. this menu item is a MUST try.. you will not be disappointed!!",

    "text": "So one of my coworkers had been raving about this spot, she said it was sOoOo good. Today I finally decided to give it a try. After finding out they have received awards and were also on 'Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives' I went in having high expectations.  I am a tacos al pastor kind of girl. So here I am having high expectations I dived right into it and ordered 4 (shaking my fucking head) I shouldn't have. It was a waste of money. First of all, they are WAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too over priced. The pork meat was SOO DRY I had to drench my tacos in salsa.  The key limes that came with the tacos had no hugo. I'm 99% sure the salsa roja that I got was salsa from the day prior. It did not taste like it was made day.  I think that the salsa roja has a lot of potential and if it was would have been made same day it would have tasted better. I could be wrong maybe it was made same-day but it didn't taste like it. It was nasty, I mean it in the nicest most respectful way ever. The tacos themselves were so dry I cannot stress that enough. Maybe tacos al pastor aren't their specialty? I don't know. I was so excited about the handmade tortilla because a lot of tacos joints don't make tortillas a mano. So here I am getting more and more excited.  And the tortilla was undercooked. I am 100% Mexican I know how a tortilla is suppose to be made and how it looks and tastes when it's 'done' The ones I received with my tacos were not done.  The horchata was good, and was the only good thing about today's meal here.   I was not a fan of how the straws are not individually wrapped in paper for sanitary purposes. They're all unwrapped and in open air where anyone can easy touch them or sneeze or cough on them.  I paid in cash, I touched cash before getting my straw. I had to get a napkin to grab a straw but even then it's like what good does it do if I don't know what the person before me did. You guys get me?   As for the place, I did arrive around noon so it was fairly clean. It's very small. I was so confused I was looking for a bigger place. The parking here is a joke.   The front board has the names/menu without the prices. That was really annoying because I was in line looking up not knowing how much a taco was until I got to the very front and found out they have a few hard copy menus that have the price on them. I found out the price once I had already paid SMFH!! Is this to make more sales? That was BS, I was unhappy about that.   The cashier was friendly. The staff bringing out the food look like they hate their job with them having to call out numbers and figure out who's order is who's since they call out numbers in a low tone like come on now we're all not paying attention. Sorry we didn't hear you call out our number in a volume level 2.   I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED I WAS UNHAPPY I WAS ANNOYED   The tacos al pastor have potential. Was the OG cook out today?  I don't know. But I will not be returning for tacos.  Taco Mich is down the street and have lower prices, better tasting tacos. Wrapped straws, better back staff and larger limes with an amazing salsa roja.   I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS OVERLY HYPED PLACE.  If you try it and don't like it.   DONT SAY I DIDNT TELL YOU SO.",

We ordered Asada, Al Pastor and Vegetarian Tacos as well as a Rajas Quesadilla. The corn tortillas here WIN WIN WIN! The asada is delicious and the Al Pastor, although not off the spit, is on point. The vegetarian taco that I had was squash, corn and cheese and very reminiscent of quesadilla filling from the little stands in 3 Marias Mexico. The rajas were traditionally prepared and the quesadilla was very fresh tasting (I know, strange for a heavy cheesy item to taste fresh, I think the tortilla had something to do with it).  The salsas were spicy and well flavored and the interior was cute and super clean, even the bathroom! Definitely a nice family run taco shop that I will be visiting again in the future!",

I felt that there was a lack of flavor in the meat, although it was soft, it was definitely missing flavor. We also tried the charro beans and they were okay nothing I would say I would go back and buy.",

Handmade corn tortillas, perfectly seasoned meat that is tender, the flavors are amazing and the price more that reasonable.  Highly recommend!!!

In full disclosure I leaned as I stopped that this is owned by some friends of the family but I could have said nothing had the food not been so great. I ordered a Burrito de Lenguas and Taquitos de Tripitas and both were excellent. I grew to love tongue growing up as my mother cooked in on occasion when it was on sale but not Mexican style. The owners are from Chihuahua Mexico and hence the name, Tacos Chiwas. As much as I loved the taquitos, the burrito was far better. It is family owned so even more reason to support it. Close to downtown Phoenix for all those there and just off the 51 and McDowell if you are traveling through. You have to try it and I will return!!!",

Great salsa, friendly staff and most important the bean and cheese burrito test. My theory on the basis of a Mexican restaurant's quality is all in the bean and cheese burrito. Anyone can put a bunch of ingredients into a burrito to make it flashy and interesting but if they can make the most simple burrito right you know everything else will be good. I'll give their bean and cheese an 8.5. The burrito was a little small but the tortilla and beans were fabulous. Overall I definitely recommend!!!!",

The picadillo burrito was loaded with flavor, the carrots and potatoes added another layer that made it taste amazing. The Taco Chiwas was really good, and the cheese was melted perfectly atop the meats for a great bite ever time. Don't forget to hit up the salsa bar in the corner, they put out fresh roasted peppers while we were sitting down and I had quite a few, they were great with the green salsa from the bar on my taco.

    "text": "Tried this new place on Friday with my entire family and we all fell in love. Between all five of us we had  a wide variety of the options on the menu. Personally I had the Beef tongue taco with onions and tomatoes, the Taco chiwas which has beef, ham, cheese, jalapeno and hatch chilies and the gordita with roasted jalapenos, hatch chilies and cheese, and the frijoles charros. One of my favorite things was the homemade tortillas and this really sets them apart to me I have been to many taco restaurants but I have never actually had any of them give me homemade corn tortillas. The frijoles charros were also a stand out. If you've never had homemade tortillas or frijoles charros just drop whatever your doing and head to Tacos Chiwas. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place, my mouth is watering just thinking about their food. So glad to finally see an AMAZING taco shop open and not just another okay taco shop.",

They are a little on the small side and the meat didn't have much seasoning to it.  Total cost with a soda was $13. I was still hungry after this meal.",

My meat eating family= stated it was very good, and there was no fat on the meat in the tacos.   The taco bar is small; as well as the seating in the restaurant. All the salsas are hottt no different flavor than the \"color\" of them.   I wouldn't recommend this for vegetarians, but for meat eaters yes! Only reason we tried this is because on FB it stated the \"best taco\" place in Arizona.",

    "text": "Growing up in LA gave me an advantage experiencing diverse cultures & food, so moving to PHX has me longing for flavor. Unfortunately, to my experience AZ has fallen short of my expectations, nonetheless I keep searching. Never give up. In my slow quest, I happened to read upon Tacos Chiwas. So, on my birthday we decided to venture out & find out for ourselves whether the hype was real. After all, tacos are life.   Upon reviewing the menu I was shocked to discover the price of a taco $2.50, say what?!? $0.50 more gets you a gorda. Then I noticed $6.00 for a burrito. Trying to stay positive & not let this impact our experience, we think perhaps the price signifies large portions. Therefore, we anxiously wait for our carne asada burrito, al pastor taco, & gordita de rajas. All for $22. What a joke when we receive our order, ni para una muela. Carne asada was tender, somewhat flavorless & scarce. Al pastor was full of flavor. Rajas were okay, I personally would add queso fresco & sour cream. The salsa bar had a variety of salsas, alongside radishes & cucumbers . Our pick was the red salsa, a bit spicy. The grilled onions & jalapenos are cold, usually served warm at most taco spots . The best part was probably the  modelos, no lie. I'm kidding, the music had us moving & singing along. Although it was not 100, glad we are making progress checking off places from our bookmark list. On to the next!",

The Asada and Pastor were way above average compared to other taco spots near by.  You can tell the meat is cooked right and marinated proper.  No chewy bs here, soft tender cuts of meat that could nearly melt in your mouth.   Now let's get to those homemade, fresh corn tortillas!!  Chiwas hits the grand slam in this department!  They serve the best corn tortillas I've had in recent memory.  So soft and perfect, this is what sets Chiwas apart from the rest.    I was reluctant when I saw the price tag on these tacos ($2.50 each), 3 Pastor and 3 Asada tacos rang up to $16.29.  But with the above average price comes above average taste.    Can't wait to try some other things on the menu.",

My son and I tried the asada taco and it was delicious.  Packed full of medium cooked chunks of steak.  We also shared two gorditas.  One with beans, ground beef and potatoes.  I loved the filling but wasn't a huge fan of the breading.  Also tried the red chili with potato one.  This was a little spicy but good.  Would stick to tacos or something else next time.  Really wanted to try the bean soup but they were sold out.  The salsa bar was good but out of cucumbers and really low on radishes.  I adored the green avocado salsa.  Service was friendly and big bottles of water for $1 a huge plus in the hot summer months.   Would not hesitate to stop in again for a bite to eat.",

My sister ordered 2 carne Asada, 2 pastor, 1 chiwas taco, and bean soup. It was cheap but not as cheap as other taco places and was about $12 for each of us. The food came out super fast which was awesome and the salsa bar was also great. I really liked the salsa. The Asada tacos were the best but definitely not as good as la santisima. The pastor tacos were super dry and the chiwas tacos was underwhelming and not worth it. The bean soup was good but desperately needed salt or needed to be more spicy. It had chorizo, hot dogs, chicarrones, and ham in it. I see it being really good comfort food, but for someone who didn't grow up with a Mexican grandma, it just wasn't great.   Overall this place isn't bad, but with la santisima just around the corner I see absolutely no reason to come back here.",

Drinks: beer and sodas Food: 4 - not a True al pastor Ambiance: 3 - outdoor benches are a nice touch, no misters though  Something that started as some of the best taco's I've had is no longer the same. Something appears to be missing. The pollo and al pastor are good, but it isn't the True al pastor. Quesadillas with the same meats are available and made with flour tortilla which is good.  Dipping salsa's, cucumbers and peppers are a nice touch.",

There is plenty of parking and also outdoor seating which isn't bad when the weather is more mild. The tacos are THE BOMB. Your cannot go wrong with any of the menu honestly but some of my faves are the carne asada taco, carnitas taco and the quesadilla. The quesadilla is jam packed with greasy cheese and I love it so much. The carnitas are perfectly crispy and the carne asada has a great flavor. There is a salsa bar with a few options. I would recommend the guacamole salsa. It has a nice spice and great flavor!",

Me and the Mrs. had 5 tacos and 2 gorditas, all with different meat fillings, and they were all tasty.  They also had a fantastic condiments bar with roasted peppers (too spicey!), cuke slices, addictively scrumptious grilled onions, and 4-5 different sauces. In closing:  Looking for authentic cheap Mex? Simple flavors, not too complex? Then this is your venue, It's gotta limited menu, Spread the good word via email or text!",

I was still hungry but there was a huge line so I opted to not place another order and wait.   The exhaust fans were not working so it was very very smokey and hot inside. It's very small inside, quarters are tight. I was there on a Sunday afternoon, about 12:30pm and all indoor seating was taken. The only seating available was outside but it was 105 and NO SHADE.

It is a small modest place with a little salsa bar which is full of flavorhad the rajas Gordita which has beans, cheese, roasted poblano and Anaheim peppers, and onions with their green salsa in a toasted flour Gordita....it was oh so good! My friends had the carne asada tacos, calabecita (vegetarian) tacos, taco chewas and asada burrito....every single one of us loved our food!

    "text": "I have been going to Chiwas since they opened.  I absolutely loved the food and would sometimes go multiple times in a week.  I recently realized that i havent been going nearly as often.  A trip back to there this week told me why.    It just isn't  nearly as good as it used to be and hasn't been for awhile.  It used to be so good that I would automatically think of stopping by for a to-go order.  I typically order a few things and eat them over a day.  The chicken tacos seem to have gotten smaller, maybe not, but the chicken definitely isnt as good and is just plain dry.  I indulge my childhood loves and get a quesadilla and bean and cheese burrito.  They used to be solid.  I mean how do you goof  those up?  Well, you double or triple the amount of cheese making it borderline gross.  And because there is so much cheese it doesn't even fully melt but still somehow makes a greasy mess.  Again, these used to be good basic items done well.  Not anymore.  My last complaint was the deal breaker for me on top of everything else.  For to-go orders they provide little plastic containers for you to fill from the salsa bar.  And when I say little I mean tiny.  Not the typical size that most places use and Chiwa used to but the ones that Chinese restaurants put spicy oil into for to-go orders because you only need a little bit of that oil.  But this is salsa.  I need more than a thimble full.  Plus it is nearly impossible to fill that tiny container without spilling.  I suspect the reason for changing to the smaller size was monetary in some way.  Why else would you make such a change?  But come on.  Don't charge me $2.50 for a street taco and then get cheap with the salsa.  Next time my taco craving hits I am headed to Tacos Huicho where the tacos are $1.25 and they aren't cheap with the salsa.",

Two customers brought their food back stating it was too pink for them and wanted to exchange it. She was so rude they instead asked for a refund.  We placed our order and the food came quickly. I had a ground beef and potato burrito which proved to have a soggy tortilla. My husband really enjoyed his taco but didn't care for the seasoning in his asado burrito. Based on the poor counter service and just OK food, we probably won't be back.",

    "text": "Great Tacos! We are self proclaimed street taco snobs, so when we say we love it here, please know we are comparing all the taco shops across the west coast. We ordered the Chiwas tacos and they were  very good! They are different with the ham, but the cheese and chilles made it really good. We also tried the Carne Asada and it was very good. Carne Asada to me comes a dime a dozen and it can be boiled or have a ton of fat and this wasn't the case. The meat was grilled and they must use their own marinade because it was tender and had really good flavor. Usually I put a ton of lime and these didn't need it. We also ordered a Carne Asada quesadilla and it was very good. It wasn't too big and they use a good white cheese: it was a little greasy, but not too bad and I will order it again. The salsa bar is pretty good. The red sauce is really spicy! I'm still looking for that really good red sauce at these Taco shops and haven't found it yet, but in all it was good here. The green salsa was very good and they had two types of Guacamole salsa. One was pretty normal and good, the other was really different. It was spicy and had a sour taste. I'll have to try it again to see if I like it or not. So, this was probably my favorite taco spot in AZ so far and I highly recommend it. It's kinda small so go at a time when it may not be busy. Also, the inside was very nice and clean.",

They have small menu with all good things. We tried the pollo, asada, pork and their chiwas tacos and they were all good. They are served street taco style. Our favorites were the chiwas and the steak. There's a mini salsa bar with a couple salsa options that were both too spicy for me but that's not saying much because I can't handle too much of the hot stuff! The only thing I could see being a problem is that they're making food as ordered so there may be a little wait but, in my opinion, that's what makes it good. Fresh food is always better.

I was greeted by a sweet cashier who was very helpful while I was deciding what to order.   The tacos were great! I had the Carne Asada, Chicken and Al Pastor tacos. The quality of the meat was noticeably above your average taco place. Each taco was delicious but my favorite was definitely the Al Pastor!   I love their salsa bar, but I didn't see any limes or lemons which was kind of a bummer. I also ordered a Horchata which was delicious! And a big plus for me is that they have Mexican bottled soda (cause duh it tastes like a million times better).   I would definitely return here!! Oh and I pray that they utilize their drive thru again because I would be back like yesterday ;)",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Eat here.  Eat here all the time.  Like your life depended on it.  And of course, get the tacos. Don't know why it took me so long to get to this place, and I regret not going sooner.  Months of great tacos lost.  I ordered four tacos: al pastor, lengua, chiwas, and tripa.  This place is a tad more expensive than other Mexican joints for tacos that are a little bigger than your average street-style taco.  That is more than made up for in the quality of the tortilla and meat.    I would say the weakest of the four I tried was the al pastor.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I didn't see a spit-roast for the al pastor mat.  A tad dry and a tad less flavorful than the best al pastor that I've had.  Still good, I wouldn't call it bad, but I don't know f I'd order it again given the other options.   The lengua was soft, moist, decently flavored.  Some pieces had a little extra chew to them to add a little textural variation, overall, a very good lengua taco.  The taco chiwa is a combination that I have not tried before.  Beef, ham, cheese, jalapeno and Hatch chiles.  I know this may not make sense, but this combination was subtly flavorful, in a very good way.  The mild cheese balanced out the saltiness of the ham, the beef added the richness and the chiles added the the heat and cut some of the richness.  I expected pops of flavor, but instead, everything mellowed into each other for a balanced, almost \"light\" experience, given that the thing was mostly filed with protein.  The namesake taco here is worth it.  Finally, the tripa.  I think this was the single best taco here.  Cooked chicharron-style, it was clean (not muddy), crispy, and delicious.  I could eat these all day, even with the tortilla.  just pop them in my mouth one by one.  They are that good.  Get over your squeamishness and try the tripa.  It is a treat, becoming more rare to find in the Valley.  (I miss ya Huachinanga.)  A full quarter of my charro beans was meat, which made them some of the most flavorful charro beans I've ever had.  Bits of ham, beef, and chicharron in the broth made the tender beans super meaty and delicious.  My horchata was more than acceptable.  It as pretty good.  So, excellent meat.  Excellent tortillas.  Minimal toppings, as it should be.  All summing up to an excellent taco - one of the best in the Valley, some of the best I've tried in the nation.  (El Chato, look out.)",

Hire an extra person to keep it clean during the lunch rush and get a pest control company in there. It will be well worth the investment.

I tried to call in my order ahead of time today, however was put on hold for 13 minutes before I just hung up. Unless you have a lot of time to wait or aren't very hungry I wouldn't recommend :/",

We ordered two lengua, two tripa, one pastor tacos and one quesadilla with carne asada. I order pastor and asada everywhere I go, I always feel it's a good indicator on how good anything else is on the menu.  The tacos didn't not have much flavor, the tortillas tasted barely reheated the quesadilla tasted like they left it on a pan long enough for the cheese to melt just a bit and then took it off.  I didn't get ANY salsa (my order was taken to go) which is like 40% of the enjoyment of tacos! So bummed about that.",

The pastor had been tossed or cooked in a medium red Chile sauce, was served with pickled onions and great cilantro. The taco chiwas had ham and turkey, pickled veggies and onion in it.  I had the pastor burro, that was a combination of beans and pastor. While it was really tasty, it was too spicy for me.  But my husband finished it and added the green salsa which he said was excellent. They grilled the tortilla, which I'm not a fan of. Overall, the food was pretty good.   The restaurant really needed to be cleaned, the windows were grimy and the room was dirty looking. However, the kitchen was very clean.",

Prices are fair, though I wish the portion was just a teeny bit bigger, especially the meat.. Price ranges are comparable to TaCarbon, which by far is one of my favorite taco places, however meat portion falls short here at Tacos Chiwas. I half-expected by tacos to be like over the top filled with meat, but I guess expectations were too high. Meat was filled up to half-way of the taco and so the rest I filled with veggies (ew..) despite that I'm not even fond of vegetables.  The restaurant seems small and cozy, a family-filled environment. Of course a veggie/sauce bar near the door so you can freely choose your toppings.",

The cheese and veggie combination is too perfect. Pollo Taco: chicken is cooked to perfection. Im a big fan of marinated chicken and don't like dry cooked ones. This one is a special case I bet.

I absolutely love a good taco shop but I didn't like it enough to make the trip for them again in the future.   They have a nice little shop, with several tables inside as well as some outdoor seating. I liked the vibe of the place. They have a salsa bar inside too for you to add to your tacos. Their menu isn't too large: a few kinds of tacos, burritos, gorditas, and quesadillas.   I tried a pastor, asada, and pollo taco plus a cheese quesadilla. My girlfriend got a pollo burrito. The tacos themselves were just average. Not bad but not amazing. The pastor was the best of the trio and did not require any additional salsa on top for me. The quesadilla was surprisingly good although it is so simple.   My girlfriend didn't love the pollo burrito. She thought the chicken was dry and pretty flavorless. I felt similarly with my pollo taco - I had to add lots of salsa to liven it up.  Arrowhead water bottles were our water option. It the tacos curbed my appetite but I can think of several taco shops I would head to before returning to this spot, especially at the price point.",

We've had our go-to place for Mexican food for a good number of years now and I've been reluctant to try someplace new for fear of disappointment but my fear was completely unfounded cause Tacos Chiwas was a winner. I can't say it unseats our go-to (Taquitos Jalisco), but I'll definitely be coming back to Tacos Chiwas for tacos in the near future.  I got myself a rajas gordita, barbacoa taco, and pastor taco while the hubby got a roja gordita, taco chiwas, and carnitas taco. The rajas gordita, though vegetarian, was arguably my favorite, closely followed by the barbacoa taco. My gordita was stuffed with roasted peppers, cheese, beans, and cause I wolfed it down a little too quickly, my description is going to end with, it's absolutely delicious. The barbacoa was just melt in your mouth, smoky goodness - I'm beyond glad that I took our cashier's recommendations (she recommended our two gorditas, the pollo, asada, and barbacoa tacos).  The hubby's roja gordita was his favorite (I'll beg to differ, having favored my rajas gordita) but wasn't as big of a fan of the tacos. The carnitas taco, though done spectacularly and just melt in your mouth goodness, he said tasted more of pork than what he was expecting of a carnitas taco and the taco chiwas was just okay, according to him. Not at all disappointed by my tacos, I think I might have to try them myself and form my own opinion here. And also try our cashier's recommendation of the pollo and asada taco. And get another rajas gordita. Yeah, if it wasn't clear, Tacos Chiwas has definitely made it on our regular rotation.",

Also I thought the food should be better due to the large Hispanic population in AZ.  This joint is just okayed in my opinion. I actually have better Mexican food in OR. I read great reviews on their tacos. So we ordered 4 tacos: asada, carnitas,  taco chiwas and Barbados. We also ordered 1 order of deshebrada Roja gorditas.   When we got the order, they gave us 2 orders of gorditas and I believe my taco for asada became taco pastor. My asada was so wet and literally dripping with sauce. Now being the first time eating it, I can't tell if the order taker made a mistake or it was just a very wet asada. Either case I didn't care for it. Also it was terrible that the order girl ordered and charged us 2 gorditas when we only wanted 1. I thought the bill was much more expensive but I thought it was the high tax there. I'm not used to pay for tax for anything in OR.   The gorditas were better than the tacos and also had more meat. They were also drier and not so wet with soggy skins.  But the best part of this joint was actually their grilled onion in their dipping bar. For about $20 to get good grilled onion, no thanks. I will skip this joint next time I visit Phoenix.",

    "text": "Tacos Chiwas is an award winning casual Chihuahua Style Taqueria in Phoenix. They have been featured on Food Network's Diners Drive Ins and Dives. The Chef/Owner was also James Beard Nominated. They serve about 8 kinds of smaller sized but well packed tacos (some are tongue and cheek), gorditos, burritos, quesadillas, breakfast burritos and bean soup. You order at the counter and seat yourself (inside or patio).  We ordered and within a few minutes someone runs out our tacos to us. There is also a salsa bar for spiking things up.  We tried the asada, carnitas and the pollo. All of them were very good but today the taco that was most developed with flavors was the asada. It had this really great smoky char and was very tender and delicious. All the tacos were really great and each one was small but well packed!  Great Value at only $2.50 a taco.",

Breakfast burrito - eggs w chorizo was a real delight. Just cant get breakfast burritos like this back on the east coast.  Im not a real fan of beans but i didnt mind the refried bean layer inside.   Barbacoa taco was nice n tender. But the al pastor was the real winner here.   Perfect amount of char and crunchy bite. Tacos are loaded on a tiny tortilla w just the right amount of space to hit the salsa bar w any additions.   Decor inside is simple and clean. Service is nice n fast. This def has a spot well deserved on the tops of taco lists in the phoenix area.",

The fillings; Red Beef seemed to be the best, followed by the bean n cheese. I do not recommend the green beef. The green beef lacks flavor and is just not good.   The tacos - they are good. The barbacoa is a bit greasy but the flavor is good. The Lengua is probably the best, it was tender and tasty. The tripas were super dry and tasteless  The place is small and not so clean, that is also part of the rating.   We would come back to try other options. Perhaps, it will increase my rating.",

The cheese quesadilla melts in your mouth with an extra thin handmade flour tortilla. The gorditas were so tasty, shredded beef with green sauce and potato and beans. True authentic dining experience. This will be a regular stop when in Phoenix.  Dined there again with fellow New York family members and it was a hit!  Everyone loved the food.",

I expected more from all that I've heard about this place, but it was not just the hype that warrants a two star reviews  I'll start with the positive, fresh made tortillas, somewhat quick service, and a couple of good salsas.  Also they have a decent options for vegetarian, my wife said the calabacitas were good.  The not so good was the pricing.  $2.50 a taco is not bad, but if tacos are going to have that amount of meat and be more than $2 they better be good.  The bad/needs improvement was the meats, as well as the cold grilled onions and charred chiles that should be warm.    While the tortillas had a good bite to them, freshly made tortillas are always part of a great taco.  However, the filling is just as important and the meats I tried were very disappointing.  The lengua was meh. The barbacoa was dry, not tender and not seasoned well.  The al pastor was not really al pastor, just seasoned cubed up pork that was dry.  The best taco was the Tacos Chiwas, because it was loaded with other topping like cheese, ham, jalapenos on top of mediocre carne asada.  My wife had the chicken taco which was also dry and not really seasoned.    The gorditas were good but very basic, just meat filling.",

They have a really good guacamole salsa is the way I would describe it. They are a little pricey for a taco shop but you can tell they use higher quality meat and can see them making the tortillas fresh in the back. Will be back.",

They also have a really fun selection of Hispanic sodas which are fun to treat yourself to when you're having street tacos! When in Chihuahua, right? The service is also top notch.

Service was fine and the dining area was clean, but became very smokey towards the end of our meal.  Who doesn't like smelling like carne Asada on taco Tuesday though?  They have a simple menu- tacos, burritos, gorditas, quesadilla, and breakfast burritos.  The food is affordable ($2.50/taco) and delicious.  I had the beef Barbacoa and calabacitas tacos both of which are not on the normal menu.  Both tacos were delicious!  The barbacoa was tender and juicy and the calabacitas (squash with cheese) were on point.  I liked the red salsa the best which was spicy and flavorful.  The green salsa was also good. It's a self serve salsa bar which I typically don't like because they are usually messy and make me wonder how people can be so disgusting, but this one was very clean.   I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Rumor has it that this used to be a BBQ place in the recent past and I believe they still might be using the smoker in the back to add some delicious hints of smoke to their yummy meats. Nice!  Came here during the Christmas holidays with my wife and liked it so much that I came back the next day. The menu is very simple with just the right amount of items. Sometimes that is the best way to keep things really fresh and tasty without going overboard. They even make homemade Tortillas for their Tacos and Gorditas which are really outstanding.  Ordered mainly Tacos on the first visit and was not disappointed. My wife tried the Carne Asada and a Carnitas Taco and a side of their yummy Bean Soup. Yours truly went with a Beef Tongue, an al Pastor, the famous Chiwas Taco, and a side of Bean Soup. It was so good that we ordered a few more tacos including the special of the day which happened to be Goat and BBQ Beef Cheek.   Everything was amazing and presented in a very old school way on some plastic plates. The textures and flavors of the meats were spectacular and just melted in our mouths. They also have a very nice Salsa bar with some really cool choices to enhance your dishes.  The next day ... ordered another one of their famous Tacos Chiwas, a Rajas stuffed Gordita and a Shredded Red Chili Beef Burrito and was truly satisfied with those items as well. Tried really hard not to overeat like the day before to some success.  Service is friendly and rather quick. You basically order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Perfect amount of time to grab a bunch of goodies off the salsa bar and do a little munching before the food arrives.  This is one of those buried treasures and from the sign outside you can see the remains of an old Dairy Queen that stood here years ago. The parking lot is small but you can also park on the other side along the fence.  This is definitely my new favorite Taco Places at the moment and it even made some noise in the local PHX Magazine a while back. Hurry in and get yourself something wonderful. Try not and eat too much or you might need a delightful cat nap afterwards. QUE FANTASTICO!  4.75 STARS",

While Chiwas is great keep in mind that there are so many gems like this in our fair Valley if you are willing to leave the safe environs of Central Phoenix or Scottsdale.  Nevertheless the owners execute this very well and do a great job of placing some lesser known Chihuahuan gems next to our typical favorites.",

I was very disappointed with the food consistency.  Big no no restaurant standards... take a lesson from McDonald's, food consistency is very very important with customer satisfaction.  They had a lot of young people cooking , guessing where the discrepancy came.  Really killed my high rating.  I went from 5 stars to 3",

Fueled by what @theflav said were \"maybe the best tacos I've had in America,\" we pounded this taco feast on a lightning fast overnight trip to PHX for U2's epic Joshua Tree tour. Just simply terrific tacos! Everything. That signature taco chiwas though...sooo good! Perfectly mesquite-grilled smoky carne asada, jalapeno and Anaheim chiles and queso. And that quesadilla and the \"Best in Phoenix\" award-winning frijoles charros?!?! Mercy! Can't wait to go back!",

Our families are from Mexico so trying to find tacos that comes close to the ones made in Mexico but these become pretty close. Tacos Sahuaros is another place that I liked but the tacos al pastor are definitively better here. The tacos are smaller than we expected but full of flavor. The only reason we are taking a star off is because of the size of the tacos and the guacamole, the guacamole is very watery and doesn't really taste like real avocado. Overall, it was great!

I was happy that Tacos Chiawas had their own salsa bar filled with spicy sauces to take your taco to the next level. The gordita was amazing as well. I've never eaten a gordita before and I was happy I took my coworkers advice. This place is truly a mom-n-pop shop who serves delicious food. Everything here was cooked to perfection. I will definitely be coming back and spreading the word of this neighborhood gem.",

You are probably wondering if I live in a hole and the answer is of course not but I thought sarcasm would soften the stars rating I'm dropping here.  The truth is that although I am not a fan of bad ratings for new places I do have to share that the costs of each taco here at 2.50 per victim is a bit much for my Mexican pocket. Sorry if I offend most here but it's True. Sure this place can offer some good tacos but paying another buck for each taco is blasphemy when you have so many more options in town. Is this place busy? Yes which makes seating hard at times, it's hot too and parking is not always a guarantee.  Sorry to crash the party and be a downer but when taco joints across the city and even states are all cheaper they also can taste better regardless of the price too. You raise prices you need to sell me an experience and I regret I just felt like I visited another taco shop... That wants more of my money for less.",

The food in here is delicious.  We ordered a raja gordita, crispy tripas taco, al pastor taco, chicken taco, beans, and an horchata.  The raja gordita was money.  Green chiles w/ cheese and beans stuffed in a small homemade tortilla.  The tripas was also excellent.  Cooked crispy and tasted great.  The pastor had a perfect marinade and was cooked right.  The chicken was boring but most chicken is.    The beans were the highlight of the meal.  Fresh pinto beans with chorizo and sausages cut up.  There was even a little tripe thrown in.  Absolutely on point.    The other highlight was the tortillas.  Fresh, hand made, exceptional tortillas.  The horchata was same as you'd get anywhere else.  They also had a salsa bar that was well stocked.  An avocado salsa, tomatillo, and arbol.  Along with that there were grilled serranos, limes, radish, and some other garnishes.  The only downfall was the price.  Now don't get me wrong, this place makes a damn good street taco but $2.50 is pricey for a 4 bite street taco no matter how good it is.  A grown man can easily eat 5 of these tacos without blinking an eye.  That said the place was really busy.  So if people are willing to pay it more power to them.    Maybe I should get in on this street taco craze...",

The indoor restaurant only seats about thirty but there is outside seating as well but dining alongside of a busy street isn't high on my list. That being said, I've never had to wait for seating inside. Trust me. This family knocks out their competition and at a fraction of the price.

The tacos, salsa, jalapeno offerings are quite good.  Today I had a pollo, carne asada, and chiwas taco which is shredded beef, ham and cheese. The creamy green salsa is very good especially on the pollo taco.  I'll be back but will order differently next time, and certainly stear clear of the overhyped been soup.",

    "text": "Yes, you guessed it... Back with another Taco Tuesday experience! Came here with my taco buddy last week due to proximity and the reviews, of course. I ordered the Al Pastor, rajas gordita and their special of the week, which was a vegetarian taco with squash and cheese. I am a really big believer of salsa bars and I was really excited to find one here. We walked over to load up on salsas while we waited for our order. I was slightly disappointed to discover that almost all of them were over the top spicy :( I wish they had a few more options for people who enjoy moderate levels of spice in their food . Even their mild salsa had quite a bit of heat.   I was surprised to find myself liking the vegetarian options a lot more than the Al Pastor. It certainly wasn't bad by any means, but there is really stiff competition around town for these puppies. My friend found this a tad too spicy, but it was within my tolerance level. The vegetarian taco tasted pretty good.. although I wish it had a little more kick to it. I judiciously topped it with the \"mild\" salsa and that added a whole new dimension of flavor. I can safely say that the star of the night was the rajas gordita. It is a beautiful blend of hatch chilies, roasted jalapenos and Mexican cheese. Was it spicy? Yes. Did it pack a ton of flavor? Absolutely! I would definitely order this again.  The restaurant started getting crowded around the 7 o'clock mark and it is clearly, quite popular. And rightfully so. I would put it in the list of \"good tacos in the valley\" without deliberation!",

The combination of ham, beef, and cheese was heaven in my mouth. If you go to Tacos Chiwas and don't order a taco chiwas (or like 10 of them) then reevaluate your life choices. I also ordered a carne asada taco, el pastor taco, and frijoles charros (bean soup), and bean/cheese quesadilla- all was quite tasty. Ohhhhh their salsa bar is awesome, great pairings with the tacos. I'll be back Tacos Chiwas!!!",

    "text": "2nd time there... I did take out in the morning, I ordered the Chorizo and egg burro and I asked about adding potatoes but the place does not have any potatoes.  1st time ever that a Mexican restaurant does not serve potatoes, that's unheard of..lol...  I also ordered the bean soup(a must have everytime your there)... FOOD was EXCELLENT.... on their website it says all breakfast burritos are 5$ but their prices must have changed to 5.50 and they haven't updated their website, no big deal.  I thought the burro was alittle small for the price but nonetheless, it was very tasty, probably the best chorizo and egg burro I've ever had.  It had alittle mashed beans in the ends of the burrito.  The bean soup is out of this world.  It's got small cubes of ham I think and a piece of bacon fat.  I can't get over how good it is.  I also took the red sauce from their salsa bar.  It was extremely spicy but oh so good.  I'll get their green salsa next time, the red was just too hot for me.  I also bought a bar of Worlds Finest Chocolate bar for a 1.00.  The total bill was under 10$ so it's very cheap. Now the bad.... the place didn't seem too clean and the young girl cashier who took my order and money wasn't in a good mood, seems like a non people person and her face looked like one big pimple, not something u wanna see in a food establishment.  They have new and improved medicine for that now, please get some and use it.  There was also a slight fly problem, I had to let one out near their side door entrance.  And the salsa bar could have used a wipe down.  Their was also alittle white salsa mixed with the red.  The place was nearly empty and the restaurant should not look like that as soon as it opens... there should be constant cleaning especially when it's not busy and please keep the flies out.  There was also a fly in the cooking area.  That's unacceptable...",

It is a hole-in-the-wall, super casual, and very authentic. I LOVE their salsa bar that also had fresh radishes, cucumbers, roasted peppers, and more. BEWARE: The peppers are pretty spicy! But thanks to their refreshing bottled grapefruit soda, the numbness went away in no time.   I ordered 3 tacos - pollo, carne asada, and carnitas. All were delicious and I would absolutely get them again! My favorite was the carne asada, the marinade on the meat was so tasty! Also, my fiance ordered a rajas gordita (vegetarian) and it was so fantastic. This is an absolute must. It is a tortilla pocket filled with cheese, roasted jalapenos, and hatch chiles. Lastly, I ordered their 'bean soup' which is pinto beans with a few different meats and a fantastic broth.   I recommend eating at the restaurant to get an authentic experience and of course, take full advantage of their fresh salsa bar. They even had a cute, young mariachi band playing in the background. We'll absolutely be back!",

I hate it when I get dry tortillas with a weird texture. I tried different types of meats. They were all seasoned nicely and very juicy. My favorite was the carne asade though. The meat was so tender and flavorful. The gordita was nothing to write home about. I also ordered an horchata and it was delicious. It had a really nice balance of cinnamon flavor, rice milk flavor, and creaminess. The restaurant was small but they have about 6 or so small tables.   I would come back here again.

    "text": "Tacos Chiwas.... where have you been all of my life? We needed a quick place to eat before taking me to the airport. I was reluctant to go but the boyfriend has been good all week so I gave in to his cravings. It's definitely a hole in the wall place but I'm glad we stopped by.  I ordered the lengua and carnitas tacos. They were both garnished with chopped cilantro and onions. Both were delish but I preferred the lengua over the carnitas... flavor and texture wise. I checked out their salsa bar and got some of the sauteed onions and the roasted habaneros. The sauteed onions - a must try. The roasted habaneros added a nice spiciness to the tacos - but take small bites. You'll thank me later.  We shared a large horchata - I really enjoyed it! It's properly spiced and not overly sweet like most places.  They serve menudo on the weekends - I love a good menudo! I will definitely come back to try that.   Price - 2 tacos, a asado burrito and a large horchata came to about $15.XX including tax. Not too shabby.   Service - quick and friendly  Atmosphere - random decor like it was decorated by a person with ADHD. Look squirrel...",

    "text": "Kept an eye out for Tacos Chiwas especially after reading all the rave reviews and put it out on my Bookmarks list.  Decided to get their tacos to see they really live up to the hype. I got their Pastor, Asada and Chiwas tacos.  Perhaps I'm used to and biased towards Cal-Mex food as I found the tacos here to be just okay. The Pastor and Asada were good, lots of meat and topped with cilantro, raw chopped onion and pickled onion for the Asada tacos. The chiwas taco was topped with queso asadero and carmelized onion. For the meats, I felt that there was a good balanced portion and the toppings accentuated the flavors. However, I was not a fan of the Chiwas as I felt that it would be more fitting inside a flour tortilla, such as if was in a burrito instead with rice. The tortillas are made in house, which differentiates itself from other Mexican spots. Salsas and Limon are self service and kept cool. The salsas were refreshingly light and had a bit of heat.  If found the tacos to be okay, price is a bit high for \"street tacos\". On it's own the tacos were good, but not incredibly amazing in flavor profile compared to the street tacos that I'm accustomed to. After finishing off my tacos, I felt like it was missing something that I often look for whenever eating Mexican in CA.  Staff was nice and service was quick. Price point a little up there for tacos. Plenty of parking and easily visible from the street. They accept cash and card.",

It was my first time having Chihuahua MX style Gordita's. My friend's family is from Chihuahua and recommended I try the Gordita's because they are different from Mexican American Gordita's. I got the red Chile beef Gordita and it was delicious! I wasn't impressed with the little salsa bar but it's not fair to compare to a Sonoran style salsa bar as this style of Mexican food is from a different state.

Their tacos are ridiculously small, and they are way over priced! $3 for a smaller than a mini-taco, taco? No thanks. Maybe I'll give them another shot and try a burrito instead.  The salsa's are \"okay\". The bean soup/frijoles charros was my favorite part of my meal, they have pork in them, and the broth has good consistency.

    "text": "So much hype for this place, i.e. a Guy Fieri visit and teaming up with Valley legend Chris Bianco for a new place called Roland's.   It must have been an off day when we went.  Al pastor is always a go to for a street taco.  But this was dry, grisly and not cut off a spit that I could tell.   The asada was very dry and chewy.  The rajas gordita was pretty good.  It has beans, cheese and some onions.  The red and green version disappointed with the potato cubes.  For us that is just filler. What saved the day for us was the lengua, some of the best we have tasted.  We liked the lengua tacos so much, we ordered a burrito.  Fantastico! Our favorite item at the salsa bar was the grilled onions.  They enhanced everything.  The sauce labeled mild was the hottest.   I noticed a guy with a small to go order piling in the complimentary sliced radishes, cucumbers, grilled peppers and sauces into his bag.  I hope they can keep the salsa bar open.   At nearly $40 not including beverages for three, we left not feeling like we had eaten much.  Everything is quite small.  Oh, and the beans others wrote about before your food is served did not appear.  Maybe that deal is over but I think they need to bring it back.  There did not appear to be any Taco Tuesday specials either. With so many taco joints to try, I doubt we will go back unless the lengua craving hits.  About the only time it is feasible for us is in making an airport run.",

Of the salsas the only one that really stood out was the bright green one even if it was so thin and watery it was flavorful. The dark green salsa verde was nicely roasted but I can't tell of the flavor and 'sparkle' is that of having beer added to the salsa recipe or fermentation. The red salsa has raw earthiness of the dried red chile, and while it has a medium heat I could have used some more flavor, some garlic, maybe salt, a splash of vinegar maybe?    I ordered 2 tacos de al pastor, one lengua, one tripas, and a rajas gordia. While I did take it to go, I don't live far, and while that can explain some of the food temp and doesn't quite explain why things just seemed dry, sad and waiting for customers.  The gordia was eaten enroute back home. The tacos at home.   In short it was good. Price was not an issue.  I will likely try them again but not rushing back as soon as many other reviewers.",

My absolute favorite menu item is their award winning beans, which I believe has made this place a destination spot. Another must-try is the rajas gordita. No other description besides I'm sorry you haven't already tried it.   Chiwas' Instagram account is always updated which is important for me as a customer. Service is genuine and kind and the owners are super cool. 5 stars isn't enough!",

    "text": "i order here are ton via uber eats and this place is really hit or miss.  i dont know if it's the time of day, day of the week, or what but sometimes you get tacos that clearly taste like reheated leftovers and other times you get much better fresh tasting tacos.  it just varies a ton.   when they're on point, they're really good.  the al pastor and pollo tacos are what they are good at in my opinion.  the carne asada is almost always dry/overcooked and the taco chiwas while a great taco flavor wise, is ruined by the same almost always overcooked carne asada.    they also mark up the prices on uber eats which is lame.  that said, it's still my go to taco shop on uber eats compared to the others in my delivery zone until something better comes along.   but if i'm gonna make my way down there i much rather go to la santisima or tacos huicho in terms of consistent quality tacos.",

Cheesey joke, but something here should be cheesey if they can't get any flavor into the pastor. I just wanted delicious tacos! Why are these $2.50? Why was this Phoenix magazine's Readers Choice best tacos in 2016? Was there a change in ownership? I'm probably more annoyed than I should be... but it's because I threw the dried up, chopped up, unremarkable tacos I paid for away, and hanger is real y'all.",

Things that I would change, first is the prices. Each taco is 2.50 as much as a medium drink. A little too high compared to other taco places but I guess I understand since they have plenty Caucasian clientele. Asada meat doesn't have much flavor, it almost tastes as if it was boiled first then cooked. The pickled onions didn't really compliment the asada meat and gave it an odd taste.",
