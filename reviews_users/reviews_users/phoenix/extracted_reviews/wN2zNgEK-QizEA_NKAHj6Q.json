    "text": "Since writing my last review, this location has improved tremendously. Mind you, my last review was directly mostly towards a specific bartender who seemed to not know exactly how to make their signature drinks and lacked in the customer service department. Since then, i have been there a few times, and i can say I'm back to being a regular customer. After writing my last review, I was promptly responded to by the regional manger. They advised that the necessary steps were being taken to ensure my experience would not be experience by others or myself again. Since, I can honestly say the experience has improved drastically. Our server today, Anu, was amazing. We had him a few other times and he is super friendly and makes our drinks perfectly (cute too)! If you ever get a chance to served by him, you will be pleasantly surprised at his level of customer service!",

    "text": "I gave RA Sushi another chance after having a negative experience in a Tucson location and at this point, I think that I'm ready to cross it off my list completely. I came here for a birthday drink and snack (small order of sushi and dessert after having a meal elsewhere) and it didn't wow me by any means. The drink that I had was good, but that's pretty much it. I ordered a tuna nigiri (maguro) and the sushi order came out before any plates, chopsticks, or wasabi did so I had to sit there and wait for those to arrive before I could eat. When I was ready for dessert, I asked for an order of green tea ice cream and our waitress informed us that she would have to check if they have it, because they were out the previous day. Ten minutes go by without seeing our waitress, and I remind her that I had asked about the green tea ice cream. She apologizes, and five minutes later returns with it. This is a rather common theme throughout this experience at RA - the food is mediocre and the service is always lacking. Maybe the issue is that I prefer to sit in the bar area, which is open seating? Whatever the case, I think it'll be a little while before I return here.",

This time, my boyfriend and I ordered the crunchy calamari roll which was okay (the crab mix seemed dry), the nutty chicken salad (good!) and two orders of yellowtail nigiri. Now, is both having been in the sushi restaurant industry and also being frequent sushi eaters, the yellowtail nigiri served was pathetic. The fish was skimpy, and thin, and one even had a tear in it from being cut too thinly. Disappointing. I don't expect RA Sushi to serve high end sushi, but I expect some kind of industry standard. Service was nice but overall the food was not up to par.",

Sometimes you're just standing around waiting to be seated because nobody is in the front.    The boyfriend and I came in to grab something to eat right after the movies. He ordered the beef teriyaki bowl and I ordered the bara chirashi bowl. I wasn't given a fork so I had to request one. The one that our waitress gave me was dirty. She was looking at the fork and handed it to me anyways like I'm not going to notice it and walked away. Seriously?! She must of been deaf or something because I kept saying excuse me but she ignored me like she couldn't hear me calling her. I had to flag down another waitress to get a new clean one. To say the least I was annoyed.   On to the food. The boyfriend said his teriyaki bowl was alright. It was mostly all rice and hardly any meat. He only ate the meat and veggies leaving most of the rice in the bowl. As for my bara chirashi bowl, it wasn't as good as before but it was fulfilling and decent. Well...at least our water is on point every time we come to RA.",

The place had a decent crowd for 3:30pm on a weekday afternoon but I guess that's probably all due to happy hour, anyway I was able to be seated at the bar right away.  The bartender came over pretty quickly to see what I wanted to drink (water unfortunately as I had to go back to work afterwards) and let me peruse the menu a little bit.  The selection is pretty good, several different options to choose from that our discounted.  I ordered the spicy tuna which is always a safe bet and a couple different nigiri but I can't remember which ones right now.

It took a few minutes for our waiter to take our drink order. It seemed a little peculiar, because the lunch rush had already passed. There were only four tables to attend to, and I saw that there were at least 3 servers on the floor.  After waiting 10 minutes for our hot tea and iced tea, I told myself that I would get up and leave of he doesn't arrive with our drinks after two minutes. Sure enough, he didn't return within that time. (Which I think is pretty unacceptable.) Who knows how long it would have taken to get our drinks?  I didn't even want to imagine how long it would have taken to get our actual food.   So here I am, at a sushi restaurant a couple of miles away.

The \"crazy monkey\" roll was actually very tasty and by far the best prepared item we ordered. Anyhow, the only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 2 is because after being seated our waitress was prompt and friendly - even though I think SHE forgot to put in our 2 orders of tempura prawn rolls and then blamed the kitchen.

The only negative was the cost.  Rather high priced sushi, but that said, where else do you get fresh Wasabi, not the fake paste?  Yeah, that's right, that green paste is NOT Wasabi -- look it up.  As a side note, there was a cop outside this place watching people leave just prior to closing time.",

We stood there waiting to be seated for at least ten to fifteen minutes and almost wondered if we're supposed to seat ourselves or just leave as there was no hostess at the front desk. Once seated our waitress had to come over two times in a row to remember she already took our orders and drinks order as she forgot. The sushi was great quality and absolutely delicious. The time for the check came and we were given someone elses check and had to point it out that this wasn't ours and then had to be given the correct check. So I mean not completely terrible just annoying in general.",

Food was decent, my salmon teriyaki was over cooked but edible. I didn't want to send it back and wait even longer.  When we were done,  i had to flag down the server to get a box and the check.

    "text": "Alright, I really don't like to leave negative reviews, but tonight leaves me no choice. Really, there were 2-3 things that were really \"wrong\", but for us, they were biggies....   1. The menus were REALLY DIRTY. I understand that people touch them with dirty hands, but please, wipe them down. It is one of the first things we touch, and it doesn't give us a warm fuzzy feeling about the cleanliness of the rest of the meal/place if the first thing we experience is someone else's food /grime... Yuck.  2.  When our sushi items began to arrive, we realized that we didn't have individual plates to eat from, so we waited for our waiter to return and asked for plates to which he replied \"we are running low on those right now, I will try to bring some out when we get some out of the dishwasher\".... Ummm... This is a restaurant... How do you run out of plates??? I accept that it was a Friday night at 7:00, but there was no wait outside, and plenty of open tables inside the restaurant... This one confuses me... P.S... We NEVER got plates.  3. I won't say our waiter was terrible, but... He was certainly not great.. our glasses ran EMPTY a few times (more than once) and he was just lacking any measure of desire to be there at all.   We are longstanding Ahwatukee residents (20+ Years) and have visited this restaurant many times. Service had always been average, but tonight... The No Plate thing just really stuck with me.  Just because you are one of the few Sushi games locally doesn't mean that if you slack, people will continue to come back.   Just saying...",

It was the biggest waste of money we've spent in a long time.  This place is all about the looks and a hip vibe. NOT about the food and service. My salad was not fresh and my Chicken Yakisoba was drowning is so much sauce it was horrible to eat. My Sea Monkey was good, but then this place is all about the drinks. The rolls were ok but this is not real Sushi. The rice fell apart in the soy sauce - the mark of truly great Sushi is not only the fish, but the rice you put it on top of. Even our old favorite tempura fried ice cream was completely cold (I know it's ice cream but in the past its been warm with a little melting around the edges). This looked and tasted like it was pre-made and thrown in the microwave.   The service was horrendous! Our waitress was attentive at first but then it got busy. She asked me if I had gotten a fork with my salad. I told her no and she said she'd bring one - it never came. She picked up my son's glass from his Virgin Mojito and said she would come right back and clear the plates. She put his glass back down on the table and off she went never coming back to clear our dishes. Another one of the wait staff did. We ordered a second roll and it took 20 minutes to come out. Then she told us she'd put the ice cream in and that it shouldn't be too much longer. At that point she left our check and it took another 15 minutes for dessert to come out.   My husband is furious because we paid $110 for a meal that wasn't worth $20. My son was disappointed and we are NEVER going back. In fact we are so upset we are going to do a redo so he doesn't remember his 18th birthday like this.  All looks and no heart!",

The RA Ahwatukee location is convenient to us and good for Happy Hour cocktails and food specials.  I find that while the bar staff seems cordial enough, they are not the most outgoing or friendliest we've experienced in other comparable spots.  However, the food here is the absolute standard of what a traditional RA establishment provides - Good.  Our favorite thing to order is the 'Tunacado'...This dish features perfectly seared Ahi Tuna surrounded by delicious slices of avocado & a side of the most amazing creamy Ponzu sauce under the sun!

    "text": "It'd actually been a while since I'd been to a Ra that wasn't for drinks on a Sunday happy hour.   I was in the area with my boyfriend and we always go to this shopping center for the yogurt and we always pass Ra. I guess I couldn't remember just WHY I block Ra out of my mind until it slipped and I decided to give it another shot.  Bad idea.  It was a very very slow lunch, so when we walked in we were surprised to see no one at the host stand. We waited for a few minutes and finally a manager appeared to seat us. Our server appeared shortly after we were sat. I don't even remember her name, but she wasn't bad at all. She was probably the best thing about the whole experience - but that's not saying much.  Anyway, my boyfriend ordered the beef teriyaki lunch but he wasn't a huge fan. I didn't try it so I can't say much else about it. I ordered freshwater eel nigiri - hard to mess up, spicy tuna roll - also hard to mess up, but it was also nothing special - and a softshell crab roll. I was definitely not a fan. The roll had too many other things in it that contradicted the crab - I ended up taking out the carrots and asparagus - too hard to put in a sushi roll! I was so put off by the roll that I didn't even finish it. It was a pretty expensive roll that should have just been kept simple like all other sushi places.   For dessert, we ordered the banana maki. Again, it was nothing too special. Overall, I wasn't impressed and was reminded why I stayed away from Ra. I think they try too hard to make different and unique rolls that it ruins the flavor of it. I'll only go back to Ra MAYBE for the Sunday happy hours, if ever.",

Cool people don't have to wait the full amount of the wait time.  Happy hour lasts till 7 and offers an array of sushi and non-sushi items.  Cool people eat sushi.  I ordered the salmon and spicy shrimp nigiri and the pork gyoza just for me.  My wife ordered some vegetarian items and unfiltered sake for us.  Cool people get it unfiltered.  My items came quickly.  The vegetarian items did not.  When I inquired about this, we received an apology and two of the vegetarian items for free.  How cool is that?  Very!!

We ordered a Tempura & California Roll Lunch Combo plus a tootsy maki and a tuna avocado roll rolled in toasted sesame seeds.   The tempura arrived, everything was barely crisp, a tad greasy but otherwise somewhat edible.   When we got our sushi rolls it was apparent with one look that they were total crap, however, starving as we were we decided to carry on and eat.   Tootsy Maki= DooDoo Kaki!   Don't be fooled by the long wait, they are not making these fresh to order.  This was definitely a roll that was prepped and pre-rolled last night!  The seaweed was chewy and slimy, the dried up rice almost broke my tooth and the crab mixture was like eating mayo that sat out over night.   My Tuna and Avocado roll which I asked specifically to be rolled in TOASTED SESAME SEEDS, was no better with it's also chewy seaweed and RAW Sesame Seeds, I didn't order a  damn big mac. WTF!   The California roll that arrived lastly with the salad was the same kind of pre-rolled crap. We ended up leaving it.   Unfortunately I had to pay for this shit, but made sure to thank the sushi guys for the worst sushi I've ever eaten and let them know that I knew they  had served us pre-rolled crap, and of course they had nothing to say but \"have a nice day\"!   *vomits*",

Additionally the service was rather shoddy and IMHO rather racist. There was definitely a perceptible difference in  service to people of the brown leaning as compared to the paler people. I've been told that's a Phoenix mentality ( but I still thinks it's absolutely wrong).  As for  the sushi well the gaari was bitter ( a good sign that the place is unauthentic) and the slices of fish (which I ordered, tuna and salmon ) were too thick ( on the maki) and in the rolls too skimpy. Shushi doesn't have too many variables to play around  with so the way to determine its goodness is based on these parameters (also on the taste/texture of the rice). The lighting was too dim for a raw meat food joint.   The  servers were attractive though (again a sign that what they are selling isn't food)",

As far as the food, I have eaten at several sushi places throughout the country and they all taste a bit fishy to me. When I get sushi I actually like it to be a bit bland. I sampled some of the more exotic stuff, and it wasn't for me.  So, for not being a sushi aficionado, by avoiding the crowded times and coming to RA's during happy hour times (7-10 i think?)

I love anything with eel sauce. My husband loved the Vegas maki but there was just too much going on in it. I did love the fried lotus chips on top. Seriously, why don't they sell those things by the bag? The cocktails were just okay. Go for the happy hour because the prices are ridiculous afterward. $8.50 for a California roll? I think not! The service was extremely fast. Our sushi came out with our drinks. The wait staff were very friendly and answered all of my questions thoroughly.

Some of the combos are just gross! For example, my roll was suppose to have fresh tuna on it but it looked like they had mashed the tuna up and molded it like catnip on top of my roll! Then, our seared tuna was completely covered with huge chunks of cracked pepper and sesame seeds...that's all you could even taste! Nothing was impressive. For a $90 tab, I was hoping for at least average!",

My friends and I popped by to enjoy the reverse happy hour a couple evenings ago. Now again, the service here is typically subpar, so my expectations are never too high. The bartender delivers a martini I had ordered, and I go to take a sip. Immediately I felt like I had just sliced my lip open. When I looked at the glass, there was a huge shard sticking out where it had been broken. When the manager, Danny Hutchinson (I demanded his card) came over, he was so dismissive, even though my mouth had been cut, and I had only taken one sip of the drink. He said \"I suppose I can replace that drink you had. You know, this happens all the time\". I said what in the world!!! I would have imagined that the manager would have been a bit more concerned as and maybe offered a round of drinks for the table for our inconvenience, but he said look I can't just be buying drinks for every table..... I was appauled. He actually had the nerve to get an attitude with me. Like I said, never again!",

Sunday nights they 'transform' the bar in to the 'Flying Fish Lounge.' A DJ sets up right around 8pm in the corner of the bar and the beats stay bumping til close. Though the beats are nothing out of this world, it just spice up the bar area, but doesn't cause too much commotion in the restaurant area...  Drinks & food at RA are overpriced regularly, but as mentioned, for HH, you can't complain. The prices range from $2-$7 for both drinks & sushi specials. Big rolls like the amazing Las Vegas Roll & probably the shrimp tempura are $7, basic rolls like spicy tuna are $4, & I think the nigri is $3.. Hot sake - $1, Big Kirin beers are only like $3, & their mix drinks range, but are never that impressive.  That night I ordered two rolls (the toosty maki is always a winner if you like eel sauce) & some yummy Albacore appetizer and my tab was $19. My girlfriend ordered dessert, and it looked amazing! An asian spin on the banana split, it was served like a tempura sushi roll, but instead was fried ice cream smothered in chocolate sauce, whipped cream, strawberries, etc. looked amazing!  Oh Ra, you may be a chain but I'm glad to have you close.",

I will say that I've never had bad service at any Ra, which speaks to a pretty good corporate structure and training program. Water glasses are always filled and if there's ever a problem with the food or drinks their people are quick to remedy the situation.   The music is generally pretty decent. Eclectic mix, with everything from Biggie and Beasties to Ramones and Zeppelin. Can skew a tad loud though.  If you're looking to blow off some steam after work Ra is a solid option. And if you're with a gal, she'll more than likely approve.",

They're fantastic at making recommendations on sushi that you might like based on your taste and the drinks there are also great. I have never had anything there that I didn't enjoy. It has a hip and fun atmosphere and it's a great place to go with a group of friends so you can get different flavors of sushi and just split them.  The only thing that bothers me sometimes when I'm there is the volume of the music. It could be a little bit quieter just so conversation is easier, but other than that I have no complaints.",

They have a decent bar and a great happy hour drink menu. That's about it. Don't eat there. Their fish doesn't taste very fresh and their rolls... well, they come out looking so fancy. But that's it.

They have great specials for Sake bombs, and the Blushing Geisha is the tastiest drink they serve (think, raspberry lemonade, spiked).  It's a great environment to go with friends, especially on a Sunday night when they have a DJ spinnin.  Not to mention, the food is delicious.

However, between the appetizer order and the sushi roll order, it took about 15 minuted to place the order. There was only two other tables in our area, so it was a bit difficult to understand what was going on, it honestly made me feel like we were being overlooked. The ambience of this location was nice and welcoming. I tried the Mango Lobster roll and Crazy Money roll for the first time, both were delicious! My other half got the Crunchy Calamari roll Chili Shrimp roll, which were delicious as well, but the Chili Shrimp was spicy. From here on out, I think any location I go to, those are going to be the two rolls I go with.",

Yes, RA sets a posh vibe, sensual vibe. We came during happy hour before a movie screening, and it was busy. I was excited about the happy hour. We ordered pineapple wontons, seared tuna, and crispy spicy tuna.  As soon as the food came, I was disappointed. The portions are so tiny! I'm glad we came during happy hour because I would never pay full price for the amount of food we ordered, which tasted alright at best.  Besides the ambience and service, I would've given it a three star rating BUT I'm not sure which dish it was, but I became extremely sick afterwards, running to the bathroom - twice! For that I have to acknowledge that I really can't return here and don't recommend it.",

My husband asked why we weren't seated first for we have been waiting and the hostess said \"opps\" and if we could wait for another table. There were no tables at the time for people were finishing up still with their meals. I was so annoyed. Completely rude. Very disappointing.

You can also sit on the patio if the weather is nice. The wait staff is above average, but they sometimes are a little slow in refilling water, taking orders, etc.  For lunch, they have a great special. You get a salad, miso soup, a California roll, and a few pieces of nigiri. The sushi rolls are very fresh, and the seafood is of very high quality. They also give you a good amount of seafood for your money. The flavors are also very good on most of the sauces and seasonings.",

When I asked the waiter, Mark about it, he dismissed it and said he would inquire about it. After an unusually long while, the manager shows up at the table, apologized and took the food away. Mind you, this restaurant is nearly empty, so no one should have been as busy as it took for them to respond. It took Mark forever to check in on us, and when he did he totally ignored me unless I said something directly to him. I don't know of he felt like I ate the shrimp out of the bowl or what, be he obviously had some sort of issue with me.

I mean, just because of this roll, I have to give this place four stars.  I also had the lobster spring rolls, which weren't as amazing as the crispy spicy tuna roll, but not horrible either.

The drinks I had were a little sweet than I usually like, but still good.  We were sat right away and the service was attentive... everything I had sushi wise was very good.  I enjoyed this much more than what I had at Kobe Japanese Steakhouse & Tepan & Sushi.  I would agree with other reviewers that the music is really loud and kind of out of place for a sushi restaurant.  In fact when we first arrived the music was at a normal level and then at some point they really cranked it up so then you kind of had to shout at the people in your party.  Other than that I really enjoyed the sushi and would come back for lunch since my office is close.",

Do you go to On the Border and remark at the lack of authentic Mexican Food?  No, it's a chain therefore it cannot truly be authentic.  It's a rule.  As far as chains go Ra isn't the worst I have ever been to.  Granted the comments about the consistency of the sushi are True.  I've had both good and bad experiences here.  Overall it is a unique chain that does a decent job selling americanized sushi rolls.  You won't find the most authentic sushi here, but the calamari roll, the Las Vegas roll, and the Gojira roll are worth trying, as long as you aren't expecting \"authentic\" sushi as some of the previous reviewers were.",

I didn't have much of a preference and wanted to make it easy for my friends who have a 1 yr old. They decided on this place, so I went with it! Next time I'll speak up and share my yelp knowledge...  Don't come here if you want good sushi. This place is mediocre at best. Maybe they don't have great sushi in AZ given the lack of ports?? I am always weary of eating sushi far from the coast. Anyway, I got a rainbow roll and spicy tuna roll. My husband also got some nigiri and dumplings. The nigiri and rainbow roll was just ok. Nothing really amazing in terms of presentation. My rainbow roll wasn't rolled very tightly and was kind of falling apart. The fish wasn't the most flavorful. The spicy tuna roll was just bad. It wasn't real spicy tuna!! They just took regular tuna and mixed it with sriracha/mayo...wtf?! I can't comment on the dumplings as I have to eat gluten free (Celiac). My husband said they weren't bad. Everything else I mentioned was safe for me to eat.   We also went here during happy hour. I felt like the happy hour was just ok...they had a big selection to choose from (drinks and food), but the discount wasn't that much. I feel like they could have offered more discount or deals. The service was fine, and they have giant booths to accommodate large parties. However, I won't be back. I also feel like I need to go eat really good sushi now to make up for this bad experience.",

Food is pretty good, I wouldn't say the best but this isn't the kind of sushi place you go to for amazing sushi, it is after all a chain. I really enjoy coming here and love the feel! You can hop on over to the bar next door for a prolonged evening or the opposite side to go see a movie, great location too.",

I can't believe this place is still open in Ahwatukee.   Seriously, the experience was disgusting and gross. I will never come back again.  Horrible!!!",

We previously came here for their 4 items for $25 and had nice service and good food.  Other times we've come and had smelly sushi (ahi tuna should not smell fishy) and my salad had dried up pieces of lettuce in it.  Not wilted, so old it was dried up and crispy.  Sometimes the staff is knowledgeable, other times they don't know what type of fish their summer special, Red Seabream, is comparable to.  The good has outweighed the bad so this is a 3 star review when it is closer to a 2.5 star review.  Other than the email specials/gift cards they send me and the late night menu, I would eat local for sushi.",

The cooked chicken was barely warm and our waiter was unfamiliar with what came with the meals. We spent half our meal thirsty because we couldn't even get water. When we started to sit down the tables were set but dirty. The hostess apologized and we walked from table to table until we found a clean one.....yet she sent no one to clean them. They had dried food on them and crumbs on the chairs. In the end, the waiter came to me and said he comped one of our meals and a half of another. After reviewing the ticket....he comped us for a meal we didn't even order because he charged us for a dinner meal in addition the the lunch meals we ordered. I've eaten at the one in Tempe and Scottsdale and had no problems. The health board should make a visit to this place as well!  I'd stay away from this place!",

Rice for sushi was seasoned ok but the rice was a little undercooked. I got the vegetable sushi which was wrapped in some weird product that was not tasty at all. The dragon roll came with a sweet teriyaki sauce on top which would've been better if it was less sweet and had more ginger or sesame or savory flavor. The service was fine. The restaurant is kind of dirty and run down looking, very dark, obnoxious music. Won't return. I like supermarket sushi better.",

There's always music playing in the background--different volumes depending on which day of the week it is and what area of the establishment you're located. It can be either dance-floor thumpin' or just background noise. Move to a different part of the restaurant accordingly.  Service is decent. Barely friendly (but enough), and frequently slow.

We sat at the bar for 15 minutes and waited before just walking out. It's not like they were super busy. We would've understood that. We sat there and watched 4 employees talking and laughing with each other having a great time while we sat there just looking at them like, \"are you going to serve us?\" I think we may just be done with this spot that used to be our favorite place to go. They have one awesome bartender nowadays, Nate. If he isn't working we just won't be going there again. It would be nice if the employees took care of customers rather than spending all their time socializing with each other.",

    "text": "I'm typically a big fan of RA sushi. This was my first time at this location since my gym is around the corner and it was convenient at the time. It took about 6 minutes for a bar tender to introduce the self and ask for drink orders, another 10 minutes to receive the waters we asked for and by then we knew what we wanted to order so we went ahead and ordered the food. Literally... 25 minutes for my buddy to get his 1st roll... and it then took 40 minutes (from order) for my poke bowl which was not what I expected- much smaller and not that delicious) and his teriyaki bowl to arrive. Once we finished... I had to ask the bartender if he put in the order for my Rainbow roll that I ordered with the other items- to which I asked to cance and close out since I was still overwhelmingly hungry and dissatisfied thus far. He gave me a voucher for $8 to use on my next visit since he felt bad. He was cool, but the place was so crowded that it affected our visit, our order, our drinks (which were refilled once in the time we were there), etc. not a pleasant experience and more of a let down than anything",

We had two kids in our party and she was so patient and kind with them when they were ordering. We loved her! The new \"RA\" men is really bad though. I purchased the featured ramen which was $15 and had zero flavor. The broth tasted like nothing and the pork was mostly fat and wasn't seasoned or anything. I totally get this is a sushi restaurant and the sushi is amazing. But when I expressed the ramen wasn't right she took it back and I expected maybe a different one or to not be charged? Our entire party passed it around and everyone thought there was something wrong with that ramen. Anyway - great service and sushi! I just wouldn't order the Ramen.",

We sat in a booth towards the back that straight up smelled like urine.  The vinyl on the bench was also torn up so every time they must have wiped the seat, moisture was getting down into the padding.  Needless to say, I sat in something wet and it was gross and it was on top of the pee smell.  Add sticky tables and a general emptiness on a Saturday night and I would have decided to go anywhere else at all.",

Another time, my charge was meant to be $23, but when I got my card back, I noticed the charge was now $33! These servers are either always making mistakes, or always trying to over charge and get a bigger tip on top. Almost every time I come here I receive bad service, never had such bad service at any other restaurant. Tried other RA's and have had similar bad experiences. I only continue to go because my friends do",

Which is why this is a two star instead of Zero. We were finished with all other food and drinks by the time the food we had originally ordered finally came. We had told the server we didn't want it anymore as we were ready to leave. He had told me he took it off our bill. When the server came he added it back onto our bill because he saw it had been dropped at the table. He then said oh so I can add it back onto your bill?! after we had said we didn't want it. Just kinda wow. What server would put food back onto a check that was clearly their bad and or the kitchens bad. Probably the worst experience I've ever had when dining out. I didnt speak to a manager but thought it should be addressed",

We were seated right away but at a table that was more appropriate for 4 people. The food was mediocare at best. I ordered Teriyaki chicken. The chicken was rubbery and tough to chew. The waitress took it back and I asked for the salmon instead. It took at least 15 minutes for it to come out. The salmon was fine but they put it on the same veggies and rice as the chicken had been on so they were now lukewarm. We also had sashimi. although the salmon was good, the albacore was cut very thick and had a fishy flavor. The halibut looked good but was flavorless and chewy. Finally, the server wasn't very attentive and we had to track her down several times to place our order, get more drinks and water, etc.",

    "text": "Ok. Let me be clear. This is typically our choice for sushi. Not because it's the greatest sushi in the world but because we like the service and atmosphere and can't go wrong  with happy hour menu. Tonight, we called ahead for party of 6. I spoke to Rachel who told me they did not usually take phone reservations but that she would oblige me because there was only one party on list in front of us. We arrived five minutes afterward-I was told we would be texted when table was ready and that they  would text when table available. We watched EVERY SINGLE PARTY be seated ahead of us and FINALLY received text one hour and 49 minutes after talking to Rachel. Sadly for RA, we already were at Ginban enjoying drinks and appetizers because we grew tired of watching walk in parties be seated before us.  Also sad for RA:  my boyfriend and I used to regularly choose this for late night, dinner, and happy hour. Now, I will NEVER spend my $$ there.  Not when I can choose from places with food and drink that compete and that pretend to value my patronage like Stingray, mido, or Ginban. Btw. If you drive two miles southwest into awhatukee, you will find a sushi restaurant that is just as good or better and where the staff value your patronage. Thanks Ginban. FU RA. You guys won't get a cent of my business EVER AGAIN. If I could give .0135 stars- I totally would. You guys suck. Your sushi is average and your hostesses don't know how to anticipate a mid size party. You pissed me off beyond repair tonight.",

The bartender explained that it was happy hour and offered the happy hour menu in addition to the regular menu. The happy hour prices didn't seem veery happy. $5 well drinks and $6-$8 specialty drinks. Food choices were also on \"special\" but comparing them to the regular price on the menu we found most were only discounted less than a dollar. In once instance, it was a 23 cent discount. The seaweed salad was pretty tasty but the rest was just average. The bartender waiting on us was more focused on two regulars or friends that sat on the other side of the bar than the other four patrons that she was supposed to be taking care of. When she would come around she was nice enough but definitely not attentive. Empty drinks, empty plates, long waits for food etc. there was a bottle of Japanese whisky that caught my eye that I asked about. She said that she heard good things about it. When I asked the price she said $8.50. I had her get me some on the rocks. I didn't really care for it, it tasted more like a scotch than a regular whisky but that wasn't her fault but I was a little taken back when she brought the check out and informed us that the drink was actually $11.50 (oops). With so many other sushi places in the valley, I don't think we'll be coming back to Ra. Oh well, live and learn.",

    "text": "I'm so torn on RA. (I know. I'm a brave person, getting up and going to work everyday and functioning with such a heavy load on my shoulders.)  Really though...I feel like I should have outgrown RA by now, but I haven't. I initially went to the Tempe location back in the day when I was 18 and hated sushi (forgive me, I was young and stupid. Mostly stupid) and ate noodles every time I was forced to go there by my ex or my friends. Now I am pretty well-versed on the sushi world and eat it every chance I get.  No, RA is not the best sushi restaurant in town. No, it is not the most authentic. But it always draws me back in. The happy hour, the drinks (Umami Punch, you are my liquid soulmate), the special rolls...I can't help myself. (\"I wish I knew how to quit you\"...)  I WANT to hate RA, mostly due to the douchebags it tends to attract, at ANY of the locations (we live in 'Tukee now, so obviously we frequent this location a lot), but I still can't. We went a few weeks ago for happy hour with some friends, and it was busy (of course). No biggie, we sat at the bar and had a drink or two while waiting for our table. They told us 15-30 minutes and we realized it had been longer than that...went up to check on our spot and lo and behold, our buzzy-thingy was not working and they had skipped us on the list and because of this, have missed the happy hour cutoff. NOOO! I needed me some cheap dranks and sushi! We sat down, the waitress talked to the manager about what happened, and the manager came over and talked to us, apologized, and let us know any food we ordered (sadly not alcohol as well, but I understand why not) would still be happy hour pricing. Pretty cool, as some places would have had a pretty \"oh well\" attitude about it.  Overall, RA is like crack, and once you've had it, you'll develop a habit you just can't kick. Pass the soft shell crab roll, please...",

I must say I think the service is indeed better at the one on Ray, food taste more as it should here too. I had their vegas roll, totally delicious! I love the happy hour here more than anything! Ill be returning again and again...  I'm glad I finally found a sushi place that almost can hold it's own against the ones I frequented in CA.",

    "text": "What the heck is the vegan doing at a sushi bar? Eating kick ass sushi!   This is my second experience dining at Ra and it was a good one! The veggie rolls are great. Stuffed with avocado and asparagus and super delicious. My only complaint is that our rolls fell apart, a problem that my girlfriend has had in the past here and that we did not encounter at Ra's Old Town Scottsdale location.  I was notified that the vegetable tempura rolls were also vegan, except that they are fried in the same oil as poultry and seafood. There was no noticeable fish and/or chicken taste so it's edible, IMO. This had squash (I think) and eggplant and was served with an eel sauce (V).  It was really loud, being late night on a Friday. But our server was very helpful. It is pricey, though! Each roll we got was $6-7 and when you add a sake bomber you're looking at an expensive night. Looking forward to going back for happy hour some day.",

Parking is usually crazy because they share it with a movie theater and other businesses.   We were seated and ordered our drinks and all was well.  We ordered our food and we ordered 3 rolls.  It took them 45 minutes to bring out our rolls when we were starving.  They never take that long and it was just unacceptable.  Every time we asked our server to bring us something we knew it was going to take him 10 minutes to come back with it.  Our daughter was waiting for her cheater chopsticks so she could eat with us, and that took forever. Same with our bill etc. It was a pain in the ass.  Their rolls are pretty mediocre anyway.  They are never rolled tightly and they are tiny.  I don't think we will be visiting a chain like this in a while.  We will stick to a mom and pop sushi restaurant.",

The young lady that helped us provided us with good suggestions and timely service.  As for the food, what can I say, after I finished the last piece or sushi, I still wanted more. Our appetizer was great also. I would suggest the miso soup paired with the tempura vegetables.   The sushi was the next best thing. I was fresh, well prepared, and the gave us generous portions. We had basic sushi, (cucumber roll, California roll, and the Philly roll), yet they were as yummy as can be.  Lastly our dessert! My wife enjoyed the green tea ice cream, while I devoured a banana split concoction with fresh fruits, ice cream, and tasty glazes.  I would recommend you try this place. Indeed the price was good too.",

I sat down while waiting for a friend and just felt the worst vibe from the waitress and the bartender who acknowledged my presence with a mere glance. When I asked for a glass of water with the lemons on the side the waitress placed the lemons on a napkin instead of a dish.  Needless to say, I was annoyed so when my friend called to say she was pulling up, I decided to head over to the sandbar instead.",

I remember thinking it was good before, but I think it's just cause I was not so widely exposed to sushi and plus, the ambience - being on Mill, with friends, during college, and the beginning of a night out - was what made it fun. So, going to this location was all right. The sushi was decent, nothing too special. I did however enjoy the drinks. They had the ingredients available to make my drink, a Geisha Flower. And surprisingly, other sushi joints don't have some ingredients so that's what made, hence the 3.5 and not just a 3.",

Then a bus boy walks by and we asked him if we had a server (it was supposed to be Nichole)  Then a manager comes by and sees us looking at our watches and all around for \"Nichole\" I see a blonde servers back to us a few times (Nichole) never even looks over at us. The manager takes our food order back to the kitchen. Nichole makes an appearance and before I can ask for a drink she swirls away. We ask the server from another area if we can order our beverages from her, so she takes our drink order. Finally my salmon carpaccio comes, luke warm, and the sauce is NOT the correct taste too much wasabi-mayo.... not even close to Mesa or Scottsdales carpaccio... my co worker gets her miso soup and is not even finished when \"Nichole\" walks up grabs the bowl and says \"are you finished?\" my friend doesn't like people touching her food while she is still eating... so she tells her to go ahead and take it. It has been 35 minutes now... NO drinks, and the rest of our lunch nowhere to be found.... So we just walked out... LOUSY food LOUSY service or rather \"NO\" service unbelievable   I was so shocked because I have never had a bad experience at the other Ra's     PS.... the portions were so small they might as well use smaller plates now :(",

    "text": "RA is sort of like sushi for people who want to say they go to RA.  I don't know how else to put that.  I came here for reverse happy hour the other night after not having been to RA in more than a year.  I used to go to the RA on Mill Ave in college, but I have not really seen a need to go to RA since.  It is just OK.  It is nothing special.  It is a little overpriced for the quality, portion-sizes and service.  The sushi is just... meh.  The one menu item I did enjoy quite a bit on my last visit was the Crispy Onion Albacore, which was 5 pieces of seared Albacore in a garlic ponzu sauce.  It was pretty weird, though.  There were no pieces of crispy onions on it, as indicated on the menu.  There were only a couple wontons on top.  Strange!  RA is a little too young, too funky, too not-so-me.  The clientele at this location seems to mostly be young twenties, but maybe that is because I have only been to this location after 7 p.m.  Still, on date night it is convenient to go to a movie and then the reverse happy hour, which is moderately priced.  At least until Pita Jungle gets their reverse happy hour going next door, there's a chance you might see me at RA again.",

Richard, the manager, was infinitely generous, helpful, and patient with our catering. We were able to rope off part of the restaurant for our celebration. There was a designated staff of 2 or 3 servers and we could even decorate as we pleased. All of our 45 guests couldn't stop talking about how awesome the food was and how beautiful the decor was! Delicious and unique appetizers such as the pineapple cheese wontons and yakitori skewers and the delicious iced tea really won everyone over. Thank you so much RA staff for making my wedding day so special! You're \"RA\"-some! We will never forget it. :)",

The service is okay, pretty friendly, just busy.  I tried the Mango Margarita last time and it was delicious.  With so many items on the sushi happy hour menu now, it is hard to pick sometimes, so I just got my usual of the Spicy Tuna Roll and the Salmon Nigiri, and of course, always edamame!  The side of grilled veggies is also one of my favorites, a little on the spicy side, just the way I like them!  Go on your birthday and enjoy a full size Tempura Ice Cream dessert!

Perhaps it's management hoping that I won't notice how awful the food is by painfully triggering my eardrums.    The noodle soup, the title of which goes something like... $14 bowl of soup (I don't know, it was so noisy, I couldn't think!) was TERRIBLE.  I really can't expound on why I found it disgusting.  All I remember as I tasted the broth and noodles was a flashback of Warner Bros. cartoons where a character (was it Bugs Bunny?) was shoveling paper money into a burning fireplace.  Total waste of money.  Mom didn't like the soup, as well.    A coworker of mine and I met here for happy hour and tried many apps, which I do admit were nicely priced.  The low prices aren't enough to get me to return, however.  The one plate I remember liking, so much so that I ordered it twice (we were very hungry) was made of tofu.  I even wrote it down and asked for it at my favorite sushi resto, but they didn't know what it could be, much less replicate it.  Since I'm not much of a drinker, I cannot discuss happy hour drink specials as I only drink water- I rarely order alcohol because I prefer to eat my calories.  Sayona-Ra!",

    "text": "RA Sushi maximizes what Phoenix is capable of doing when it comes to sushi. It picks a specific set of dishes upon which it perfects the craft of. Each piece of sushi ordered stays intact, and, while the fish isn't as fresh as it would be in other cities like Los Angeles or Seattle, it accomplishes what it originally set out to do.  I ordered the Rainbow Roll and then backed it up with a Sapporo. It was a good combination. Sushi has to be defined in terms of its form, notably if it can stay together in one piece when you pick it up with chopsticks. It stayed in one piece, each and every one.  The Sapporo was good too, it's what you expect out of a Japanese standard beer.   As far as the ambiance, the bar is situated on the right as soon as you walk in, and the main dining room is on the left side which is situated with the sushi bar. The windows are full body and give you a view of the shopping center parking lot. Not too glamorous, but in the desert, your options to view things isn't too diverse anyway.  Service was good, they were attentive and mindful of the tone set at our table, so that was good.   Would return, but I don't live in Ahwatukee and only came to meet a friend to discuss business matters. So we'll see.",

The door is offset to the point that I couldn't lift it up high enough to get the latch locked. There's no way the door will stay shut without using one hand the entire time to keep it shut. Quite annoying. The food was pretty good. It wasn't spectacular enough for me to make another 45 min drive to return though. :(",

I ordered 4 sushi rolls, some chow mein noodles, some pepper thing for appetizer my bf always like to eat, and sake. My bf told the server it was my birthday. She gave us a comped ice cream cake dessert which was nice of them!  The bill came out to $50 which wasn't bad for all that food and drink! Service is always great! I never had a bad time here.

My friend and I have been to this location multiple times and have suffered some red flags, but this time really blew us out of the water.  When we arrived there were five other people at the bar. The waitress who I believe her name is, Natalie. Was slow and inattentive. She obviously did not want to be there. After waiting 20 minutes, we chose to try and move to the dining area when who I believe was a manager, encouraged us to stay and he assisted us. His work ethic was just as poor if not worse for not leading as an example.   As a restaurant manager myself from a high end resort who serves over 2,000 people from 5am to 9am and then double that number for dinner.... I am painfully disappointed.",

It was long enough that we really couldn't remember if we liked this place or not.  So, we decided to give it a try. We were seated promptly, and had our drink orders settled in no time. I ordered the Chicken Udon, and we also ordered a selection of sushi. The shrimp calamari sushi, vegetable tempura sushi, and the dragon roll. The chicken udon was great. Plenty of chunks of chicken and a tasty broth, with perfectly cooked noodles. There was enough to share between us. The dragon roll was also delicious, with a great sauce drizzled on top. We were a little less impressed with the shrimp calamari and vegetable tempura rolls. The tempura pieces dusting them made the dishes really dry to eat. The vegetable tempura could have used a bit more flavoring to the ingredients.   We have some favorite sushi joints, so this one probably won't push them out of the way. But all in all the restaurant isn't all that bad. We definitely be back for more udon.",

Soothing and fun, there was a pretty good happy hour menu but prices weren't the greatest. $7 for a shrimp tempura roll which is not much less than what we'd normally pay. I'm also super bias cause I also hate shrimp tempura rolls when they put veggies in it like asparagus... needless to say wasn't too big of a fan... edamame was over salted but the soybeans themselves were sweet and fantastic. Hubby tried to order a shrimp fried rice but they only do chicken and it would have been a $4 upcharge so that was also a bummer.",

The service I received was exceptional. Our waiter was pretty prompt and got our orders in and the food took about 10-15 mins to come out which is fine. Our waiter also came and checked on us periodically to fill waters and ask if we needed anything else.   I recommend The Lobster Roll, The Vegas Roll, and The Chili Ponzu Yellowtail roll. One word, Exquisite! Other then that, the rest of the rolls were delightful. Also, recommend coming around happy hour time to save money. Cheers!",

    "text": "BACKGROUND  My friend, Eva, LOVES getting happy hour at this particular location, hence, we've been here countless times, and we've ALWAYS had a great time here.  I've also been here on date nights, and solo, and it's a solid place to get sushi  RA SUSHI BAR RESTAURANT  Interestingly, Benihana Inc owns/franchises the RA SUSHI brand, along with 116 Japanese cuisine restaurants around the world, including Benihana Teppanyaki brand, and Haru, and was founded in 1964, by Hiroaki \"Rocky\" Aoki, in NYC.  Now that there are five Phoenix area locations, including, Ahwatukee, North Scottsdale, Mesa, Old Town Scottsdale, and Tempe, it's safe to say the RA SUSHI franchise is going strong in Arizona.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  My last experience at this establishment was last week after my dentist extravaganza. After 3 hours of dentistry, I thought I deserved a little sushi treat.  At this location, I usually like sitting at the bar, although at my last visit, I sat at the sushi bar and chatted with the very charming sushi chef.  Of course, I asked for my FAVORITE drink, the Fuzzy Momo Bellini, and sadly, their frozen ice machine was broken.   Ughhhh, that drink is my highlight. Oh well, I tried the Pretty in Pink, and it was alright, but not a Fuzzy Momo Bellini.  Since the Pretty in Pink didn't hit the spot, I got a Sapporo light. I also ordered the quail egg shooter, which came with sake, which was VERY DELICIOUS.  One of my mainstay, must-haves, is the tuna sashimi, as the tuna is always EXCELLENT here. Then, I like to venture out and try some fancy rolls.  My sushi chef recommend the caterpillar roll and the rainbow roll, and I picked the mango lobster roll, which were all OMG YUMMY; like melt in your mouth fantastic flavors.   The servers are always very pleasant, this time I was lucky to have Bryana. Even when you sit at the sushi bar, the servers take the drink orders and bring out the items from the kitchen that don't involve the sushi bar.  CONCLUSION  RA SUSHI has a soft spot in my heart, since I've had so many great experiences here, so I admit a little bit of a bias.   Honestly, this particular location is nice, and mostly 4 Star, although parts of the experience were 3-3.5 Star, mostly the decor. It's a competitive market out there with all of the new high end spots, so I need to be honest.  For the non-aficionado, this Ahwatukee location of RA SUSHI BAR RESTAURANT is a solid place to get sushi.  4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Plenty of parking out front.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frasushi.com&s=915add3c3a36259734cec547ac7e007419692c9a4bd76032ca4de054d4e87eaf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rasushi.com</a>",

    "text": "Normally I am never on this side of town. I was in the complex and absolutely starving and pleasantly surprised that  RA are opens at 11 a.m!!    I ordered the blueberry watermelon Martini to start, very crisp and refreshing. I don't know why but I decided to try a different martini and went with the mango. A little bit disappointed here,  the mango flavor was very faint and bitter, I was expecting more of an overpowering sweet flavor. Definitely wouldn't  order the mango margarita again.  I ordered two entrees. The first one was the tuna salad off of the lunch menu. I was a little hesitant at first but happy with the outcome. For only $7.90 it was a steal. The saled had seared ahi tuna with albacore tuna. The tataki and garlic panzu sause woken tast busds I never even know I had. The flavor was  literally explosive. The earthy greens, tuna and sauteed cashews gave the saled a fresh and crisp tast. No joke I think this is the best salad I have ever had in my life  I also ordered the crazy monkey rolls. Rolls come with smoked salmon, mango and cream cheese rolled and talk with avocados red tempora bites and sauteed cashews drizzled with mango and Spiel sauce I also got the spicy mayo and jalapeno smoked Mayo on the side.   When I got my order our there was no spicky mayo. When I took my first bite of the crazy money till I was extremely disappoint. With the description smoke salmon  I was expecting a smoky flavor however this is not the case at all. The role had a very overpowering fishy taste. Very distasteful. I also thought there would be a lot more cream cheese and they're all there was barely even a sliver. I will definitely never her order this roll again.  Know for the services. I'm a little hesitant about this one. My server was very fast but not friendly. Being 11am the place was dead and I expected a little more friendliness. When I had questions about CERN rolls instead of answering my question I was redirected to certain areas of the money. I personally thought this is a little bit unnecessary. Throughout my dining experience which was about an hour and a half not once was I asked how I was doing or if I like my food, to me this is absolutely unacceptable especially with our a being and nicer establishment. I would expect this kind of service from my local burger shop not 'Re. If my server bothered asking me a how i was doing she would know that i was not satisfied with what I orders.   For paying $51.8p I really do expect a lot more. Even have to stop at another employee to pay my tab.  Needles to say I will not be coming back to this location. Bummer to i just got a job in the complex and though this was going to be my go to spot for lunch.   Good things there is so many options in this area. But seriously I would talk to your bartender. Although she was not rude whatsoever and the food came out that fast which I appreciate. I just felt like I was an inconvenience and that I was bothering her anytime I ask for something.   For being the only Patron in the bar for the last half-hour there was no reason for her not to ask me how I'm doing and if I like my food ext, ridiculous. I guess only certain type of customers matter. But on the flip sise I am more quiet reserved type of person so I won't address an issue unless I'm asked how I like my food and how my dining experience was. But nevertheless I don't think is okeay to ignore your customer for over 1hr and a half.",

Pork dumplings have an overload of spices and more in the sauce.  Not a good pick for kiddos.  (Never seen it anywhere else).  Edamame was good....just perfectly salted.  (Why the 2 stars).  Sushi was: Tuna: I guess u have to ask for wasabi to be placed between rice and fish.  I thought it normally has some.  My bad!  But the tuna was so fatty we could not chew it.  Next! Salmon: stinky and way oily.  Not sure what happened here?!? Crab: it's imitation but it doesn't need to be the loser of a race between a lobster and an airplane!  (See pics!)  Disappointed.",

There were four waiters in our area. 10 minutes turned into 20 minutes and not one waiter came to our table. At least one of them could have came to ask if we wanted water. Two new bales were seated with drinks and one even had appetizers. I would normally leave a place like this but my daughter was hungry. I went to ask the hostess (red hair) if I could speak to a manager, she said ok and went to look for him. The second hostess(blond) asked what the problem was and I told her. She stated that they had a rush and were busy ( all while looking at her phone. The manager  (James) came out and after explaining the situation, James apologized and said that he would help. James appeared to be disappointed and wanted to make my first experience better. James took our orders and eventually our waiter came. Our waiter Jack stated that there was a mix up in the rotation blah blah blah because each waiter looked right in my face and said nothing. Jack however did put his best kiss ass attitude on from that point on. The food was excellent and if it were not for James, I wouldn't return. James did alter out bill by taking one roll, seaweed salad and $10 extra off of our bill. James is a great manager. as long as they have people like him and Red hair, I will be back and change the amount of stars",

If not Happy Hour, this place becomes a fairly standard sushi place, from a price perspective - but on happy hour they have good food for fairly cheap. And anyone that knows my thrifty self knows that I enjoy a good Happy Hour deal.   The service was good. The waitress hovered a little too much for my liking, and in despite of this excessive hovering showed a little low attention to detail. Good thing the food quality is good. We tried a little of everything from their Happy Hour Menu and taste-wise it was delicious and enjoyed by everybody in our party.   I haven't been to any other RA franchise partner locations, but this one is big and nice. I mean I really was surprised in a pleasant way.

Grossly overpriced for what we received and service was mediocre at best. Nothing like white rice and a flattened piece of chicken for $16, no veggies, no sides, no nothing, the breading was the only thing I cared for. The sushi roll was falling apart and was not cut to an appropriate size, we had to cut the pieces smaller with a fork and knife. The lobster spring rolls were good but not good enough to go back. Better bang for your buck elsewhere, with better food, better service and better music that is not meant for 12 year old girls.",

The waiter took my water glass from the table to refill it and didn't come back for almost ten minutes as an example. Not sure he really knows how to wait a table. Their signature cocktail was so sweet it was hard to finish. The short rib appetizers were bland and very fatty. The vegetable roll was very bland as well.  Bad drinks, bad food, bad service.  We won't be going back soon.",

Other times, it looks like a work of art.  it depends how busy they are.   But always tastes decent.  The music in the restaurant is uncomfortably loud & dark.  On permanent night club setting.  Whenever I see little kids eating here, I question their parents' decisions.  Even during Happy hour, their drinks are expensive.  I always go home disappointed by their cocktails... even with the discount... because they're just not good.  Stick with beer.

We stood there for what seemed like 10 minutes before the hostess finally appeared and what a negative nancy she was! Our server, a young blond guy, was much nicer and very attentive.   The food was good we had the tootsy maki roll, and 2 salmon  bento boxes. Bento boxes were a little over priced, it was after 3 so they were no longer on special for $8.75 but instead 11. I recommend the baby umami punch drink during happy hour wouldn't pay full price for it but at 6.75 it's not bad. Could be less ice and more drink though!   Overall experience was ok. My bf and I joked that a requirement to work there must be to be bitch-y because wow most these girls sure were! RA do some customer service training with your people and you'll be golden !",

Don't know how anybody could not give it 5 stars.    The sushi has always been great.  We have never had a bad piece of sushi here - in fact my sake bomber and I consider it to be kind of the standard by which we measure other places that serve sushi.    Yes, the Kirin sake bombers are always on special, but I like Asahi better than Kirin and they have both, so I'm in good shape.    Additionally, the female employees are generally pretty attractive at this place, which makes it easier to sit and hang out for extended periods of time.  And there are usually a couple of dude bartenders that my wife can stare at a little, so she's placated.    The crowd is usally pretty good Thursday, Friday & Saturday nights, the club music type atmosphere is current, relevant and helps keep you in high spirits.  Finally, since the theater is right next door, you can people watch from the patio pretty easily.    Pricing is what you would expect for a place of this caliber and atmosphere.    Highly recommend.",

All the food was super-fresh. Yellowtail was a little too cold, actually, had to let it sit for a few minutes. Had to wait a little longer than I'd like to pay the check, but that's because our server clearly had too many tables to handle - when the place is packed like that, they should schedule more servers to come in.",

But be warned, if you're in the mood for authentic and fresh sushi and a relaxing atmosphere, this is not the place.  The patio, during the cooler months, is quieter and more enjoyable (and is a decent place to people-watch on weekend nights). They have a great bar if you're looking to socialize and have a few cocktails during happy hour.   The special rolls are good. I love their Ultimate Shrimp Tempura roll and their Ahi Tuna is good. However, the seafood is not as fresh as it could be. The prices are a bit expensive for only receiving decent sushi.   When you're traveling and don't know any local sushi joints, Ra is a reliable chain to go to.",

    "text": "We came here because we were excited about their extensive yet reasonably priced happy hour menu. Unfortunately, after eating here, that's the only positive I can think of.   The two of us ordered quite a bit: salmon nigiri, pineapple cheese wonton, short ribs, sweet onion salmon, crispy onion albacore, and kaisen ceviche. The waitress accidentally got us one instead of three nigiri so it came out in two orders. The salmon quality was mediocre, but each order didn't even look like it came from the same restaurant. Different cut, different portion, one with wasabi, one without. Just very concerning sign of quality. Both the sweet onion salmon & crispy onion albacore were sliced so small you could barely see the fish in the marinade. The short ribs and pineapple cheese wonton were nothing special, but also very small. The kaisen ceviche was the best dish, but it was clearly not real ceviche as the seafood was so well done it was obvious it was cooked beforehand instead of made with raw seafood. The portions were so modest we ended up ordering dessert as well, which was pretty mediocre as well.   I generally don't like to write about service, but it was just so blatantly bad here. We were seated at a table with place settings yet wasn't even cleaned. They were confused about which server was ours. Waitress confused our order. She spilled beer on our table, laughed it off and didn't even apologized. Later she would clear our dishes while putting other customers drinks on our table. And the restroom looked and smelled like it wasn't cleaned all day.   Summary: very disappointed after spending nearly $60 for 2 while getting mediocre food with skimpy portions and subpar service.",

Found that there was a RA sushi bar right near the place we were staying at, and so what I thought was going to be a decent sushi place; since we have one back in CA ended up turning into a horrible experience. To be honest the only good thing I remember about this place was the hot waitress and the green tea...lol...I mean the service took forever (which btw it was around 3 pm and no one was in the restaurant), so either we had some beginner sushi chef learning the ropes or they just decided to take there sweet ass time. If it weren't for the eye candy and the green tea I wouldn't be able to give it any stars, but I decided to be nice and at least give them a star for effort. Have fun for whoever decides to try out this place. Never going back that's for sure. =P",

The happy hour menu is pretty extensive with appetizers ranging from the standard california roll to gyoza, seafood dynamite, and coconut shrimp skewer things.  However, where RA truly shines is it's specials on alcohol.  Food may be ordered when the hunger arises concurrently with inebriation, but at that point it doesn't matter if it's just so-so or even sub-par (it's like having beer goggles, but for food, not chicks).  However, I can't give this place a complete crap rating because of all the wonderful drunken memories I've had here (the few times I actually remembered the outings/the first half of the outing).",

There's always a manager to be seen, I talked to one of the managers (James) Who came by to take some dishes off of the table and ask us how our meal was. He was knowledgeable and professional. You can modify pretty much any roll or entree. This restaurant doesn't only serve sushi, it has things like chicken or beef teriyaki, yakisoba, Udon, and all kinds of delicious appetizers. The clam udon and scallop dynamite roll are amazing! Perhaps the best thing about RA is there happy hour, from 3 to 7 and 10 to close. their bar is fun and has a great atmosphere. Their lunch specials are fantastic as well. If you are a more experienced sushi eater, they have sea urchin, toro, octopus. As you can probably tell, I come here all the time. Overall, this is just a really great place for any time of the day.",

I dated a guy many years ago who was really into sushi and he would take me to the best Omaha has to offer and show me how to use the chopsticks and mix the wasabi, the whole 9 yards.  I gave it the good ol' college try, and I just can't do it.  My stomach rolls over after a couple of pieces.  Well, I think that, combined with the fact that when he purchased his new 7 Series, I didn't writhe all over it like Tawny Kitaen,  made me less appealing.  Such is life.  Now I'm married to a man who doesn't like sushi either.    What was I saying?  Oh yeah!  We had a great lunch at RA between movies.  We each had the shrimp tempura bento box, which came with 4 shrimps, a spring roll, a potsticker, a salad, miso soup, and some fluffy white rice for $8.95.  Everything was delicious.  We also tried their seaweed salad which was nice and fresh.  The service  was great too.  We  had a few of their cocktails which if memory serves, were very tasty, but we got a little loaded and then went to see Gravity in 3D, so my memory is a little hazy.   It was one of THOSE afternoons.    I thought the lunch was definitely a great deal and would go back for that anytime.",

After walking into the loud club-like atmosphere, we chose to sit at the bar for the experience with the Sushi Chef. After watching some children left unattended playing at the sushi bar; a server walked up and asked for our drink order. He then explained that since the Sushi Chef's get too much attention and \"step on our (servers) toes we now order through us\". (Typically if you eat at the bar, you order with the Sushi Chef and bypass the server). After ordering three sushi rolls, we sat and tried to have a conversation. The music was so loud and distracting that it took away from the enjoyment that could have occurred. All throughout our meal, we were interrupted by our server chatting it up about his personal preferences while reaching across us for the plates. I'm assuming that the manager didn't explain to the server how to clean up and not physically put your body on top of the customer repeatedly.  Overall, the food was bland and UNDERwhelming, typically priced and will not be tasted again by us. Thanks RA for reminding me that True quality is not something you shoot for.",

The rolls weren't very large or flavorful.  BUT, their Happy Hour is fantastic and the plating is aesthetically admirable. One dish I particularly enjoyed were the mussels in this flavorful garlic and leek broth. I ordered extra white rice on the side and make a little soup and was stuffed. Super filling and delectable.  Also, their sashimi is nice, which I always find is the mark of fresh fish at a restaurant..  Happy and pleased. Keep up the good work guys!",

Good thing we always check our tab. They took the $23 off of the bill and as we were getting ready to go a waiter came up and gave us our food and we declined it.

    "text": "It was pretty bad overall. We came in around 12:30PM on Sunday and there were only 2 other tables in the place. We felt rushed even though we said we wanted/asked to take our time. The appetizers came our and the waitress immediately returned with our lunch specials. The pineapple cheese wontons hardly had any filling. We paid $8.30 for for of them. I would have been mad even paying $4. We still had food on our plate when the waitress came back and started to clear them. Bye half of my lunch. Next we ordered the fried ice cream for desert and it just seemed dry and crumbly. To top it off when we were asked for the 3rd time if we wanted to pay our bill, as soon as the waitress walked away I was so annoyed so I put down cash and left. The waitress saw us get up to leave and ran to the the table to make sure we weren't dining and dashing. I guess maybe that happens a lot here since the place was overall quite bad. I have been to Ra many times before in Tucson and it was much better. Not sure if this location is just off or if the quality overall at this chain is slipping. Either way we won't be back.",

They have changed the menu since I was last in (not that long ago)...new prices on some things (I'm lookin at you happy hour menu) but it's not enough to turn me away.

While our buddy took care of us and served us the most beautiful cuts of fish, everything else here is pretty generic.  By all means, the fish is delicious and fresh but for the price, what are we really getting here?  The portions are on the smaller side considering how much you're paying.  Sure the atmosphere is great and the decor is gorgeous but in the end, you're just really paying to say you went to RA.  Even the servers can be a bit on the snobbish uppidy side.  Take your money and support the small local businesses around town!  One positive thing I will say about RA is that I do love the Umami Punch.  Great cocktail to share with a significant other.",

Went to Ra yesterday (Sunday night around 9pm) and there wasn't very many people in the whole place but music was blasting from the bar area. Little obnoxious (just because it's louder doesn't make it better, this isn't Tao). There was no hostess around and finally a waiter took us to the dining area. We asked for a booth and out of the entire dining area, there was one other party and of course we were seated directly behind them and next to the kitchen entrance non the less (lazy seating if you ask me, people don't like to sit next to other people... like in a movie theater). It stunk and the booth seats looked greasy and bits of food left over from the previous party (is this the only booth they use?). We asked to move to a table and we were moved to near the walkway (again, kind of lazy) and there was food all over the floor yet again. So weird because they weren't busy whatsoever. We decided to go elsewhere and on the way out saw the hostess sitting on the counter as she mumbled \"goodnight\" to us. Maybe she could have vacuumed the place since it was so slow and seemed to be doing nothing else but \"stealing a paycheck\".  Also the bathroom smelt like a bathroom... not good.   Ra always has good food, I just wish they out more effort into their appearance.",

I always forget when it's happy hour, and I order a roll, the roll is more rice than usual and smaller portions of fish--the same held True here.  But that was my fault.  The rainbow roll was $8.99, so why not spend a little more and get the non-happy hour rainbow roll with less rice and bigger pieces of fish?  Next time I will.  All in all, the sushi was good as was the tuna tataki (also at the happy hour price).  That was a meal in itself!  I had ordered seaweed salad, but cancelled that when I saw the tuna tataki.  So much food!  Service was excellent--we had Nikki and she acted like she really wanted to be there and that she loved working there.  How refreshing!  I also completed their web survey, so we have a $10 credit when we go back (good for 30 days from our visit).  Love it!",

If your like me and like red meat, grease, and dairy products this IS NOT YOUR PLACE.   My buddy got a bunch of items from the sushi bar and he liked them.

Highly recommend this place for a family dinner, me and my family shared a number of platters and none of the platters dissapointed. BEST CALAMARI EVER, you definitely have to try it if you go. I hardly order sushi so I wouldn't trust my judgement entirely but I really liked the sushi I had here. Also they definitely aren't stingy with their alcohol, for an $8 drink (we came during happy hour) you might just leave the place a little buzzed. Our waitress and the staff were very exuberant and friendly I'd say 5 stars on customer service. Only recommendation I would give the company based on my experience is to change their chicken teriyaki dish. It needed more flavor and I didn't enjoy the selection of vegetables it came with.",

This past time my husband and I went, he could have sworn the rice was different on the rolls (I couldn't really tell a difference but he didn't like it) and I know this is small to most people, but they don't have the low-sodium soy sauce anymore. We tried the regular soy sauce and just did a tiny bit, but it was so salty and overpowering, that we couldn't really enjoy our rolls.

    "text": "I've only been to this Ra once or twice, but I think the price is overestimated here.  Maybe people are having too much Sake.  The service is decent, ambiance is very faux Japanese-American deal.  Sushi is pretty good and if you go during happy hour it's a steal.  Sake and Kirin is like 3 or 4 bucks and you can get a thing of Sake for $1.  They have a nice patio sitting area to people watch. Great place if you want to catch a friend for lunch or do dinner and a movie.",

Not only were the selections minimal, the quality seemed to suffer greatly as well.  We won't be back, especially with all of the other great happy hours in the area. Nice move corporate! Let's see how that one works out for you.",
