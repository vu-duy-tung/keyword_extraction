    "text": "I grew up eating Cheddar's. It's a smaller chain that doesn't advertise and how consistent, cheap food that's actually pretty good. My husband and I were excited one finally opened up in Arizona, specifically the Phoenix area, even if that location is way out in Chandler.  It's a big restaurant, so a wait usually isn't too bad. The food ranges from eh to pretty good to hey this isn't too bad. For appetizers, the onions rings aren't bad, and neither is the queso.  For entrees, you can get some healthier options. I usually like the veggie plate with a salad. Chicken fried steak is a good staple, and the burger isn't bad (although you have to order fries separately). The Caesar salad pasta is an interesting take on two dishes - basically a big Caesar salad on top of a bed of pasta.  Desserts are all pretty good too. Mixed cocktails are fun and the painkiller is actually strong.  If you're on a budget and in the Chandler area, especially if you have kids, Cheddar's is a good way to go. I like to eat here when I'm homesick and trying to save some money.",

Anyway, it was my birthday and my parents wanted to treat me for a nice lunch to which we all decided after looking online at what cheddar's was all about, to try it out.  When we got there, the inside looked amazing, a bit upscale and the menu selection looked inviting and I was happy about the combination choices as well, given that I am that person that needs to try everything.   We ordered the stack of onion rings as an appetizer which was delicious. I also ordered strawberry lemonade which was really good, a bit on the sweet side though. For an entree, I had a half rack of ribs/fried shrimp combo with fries and a side of mac and cheese which was amazing.   I would definitely come back for more!",

But I'll explain why. We ordered chicken tenders, fries, house salad and fish n' chips.   I was leaning towards trying a burger, but I wanted to see how he deep fry skills were here. In which I was sadly disappointed, the skin was not as crispy as I imagined, and very bland. The fish inside was just weird, I feel like it was the wrong type of fish to deep fry? Oh if I could only remember if it was cod on the menu but my memory fails me. All I can say is that it was the quality was not memorable at all. There wasn't even lemons or coleslaw on the side, no fries either. The chicken strips were just ok and the house salad was your run of the mill, feels like iceberg salad from a bag mix.   This place remind me of big chain restaurants like Chili's and Applebee's, and there's nothing wrong with those places, they're just mediocre in the quality of food and expectations, and this place falls along those lines. Sorry, wish I was more impressed but I'm just not.",

We told him it was our first time dining at cheddar's and he gave us a full speech about the menu including multiple great recommendations from each section. He was very personable, quick and kind. My buddy and I are going to go back there almost completely because of Tyrell!  We ended up ordering almost everything he recommended. I started with the Wisconsin cheese bites and my buddy had the queso dip. I had the chicken tenders & ribs combo with a side of string beans and mac n cheese as my entree. My buddy had the chicken tenders & shrimp combo with sides of fries and mac n cheese for his entree. All of those was delicious! I could spend time explaining what was amazing about every part of these dishes but then this post would be too long!   We ended the meal with the big cookie dessert. This was good but not great. The cookie was too airy and slightly over baked but the ice cream was still good haha.   Over all this place was awesome; my roommates and I are definitely going back!",

The service was friendly and attentive. We stared with the queso dip, which was decent.  I ordered the Asian chicken salad and the boyfriend got the Tuscan chicken sandwich. The salad was very good, and a little different  with having mango and a touch of mint. The chicken sandwich was pretty average. Everything is very affordable, with entrees  around $10. The food is a solid 3 stars, service/atmosphere 4 stars, price value 4 stars.",

    "text": "Third visit today since this place opened.  The decor is fantastic and that's all I have nice to say.  The hostess staff is rude, insolent, self absorbed and untrained.  Three times I have had to deal with an obviously overwhelmed young girl with a waiting list, waiting disks and asking names.  Let alone figuring out how to instruct the seater where to take a party.  I understand long waits and long lines and am very patient but not a rude hostess who acts like if another person walks through the door to eat at this restaurant, she will be leaving.  My husband enjoys the short and tight skirts on the hostess staff though.  Today's visit was no better to start.  I really felt like I interrupted a private conversation asking for a table for three.    When we were seated, apparently the server had been triple seated and argued with the hostess right in front of us.  Truly.  I felt like I should go elsewhere.  Anyway, after a lot of excuses ahead of time why she won't be with us quickly and why our food won't arrive quickly we finally were served.  I ordered the fish and chips and the batter was raw inside and fries were cold.  Not much more I can say.  The manager did come by when the server noticed I didn't eat the food and he did take that plate off the bill but I can truly say, third time was NOT a charm.  I'll be going back much later when they get more experience and time under their belt.  For now, 1 star.  I'm hoping I'm wrong.",

Decor is nice and they have a pretty fish tank.  My husband enjoyed his big stack of onion rings.  Otherwise the food was pretty mediocre and over priced in my opinion.  You could get similar food at a Chilis with no wait and half the check in my opinion.  The food was about the same quality.    My husband also had a burger, and I had chicken fingers.  2 people in our party had a beer, but no desserts and we still ended up with an $80 + tab before tip.  It seems expensive for pretty typical 3 star food in my opinion.  Nothing outstanding here.",

I got the chicken tenders and fried shrimp which was amazing also it all tasted fresh I did have an issue with the mashed potatoes which seemed like a puree but still had great flavor. My wife got the chicken pot pie which was amazing the crust was so flaky and delicious we also got the Wisconsin cheese bites which were very yummy. we ended the night with a choclate bread pudding which melted in our mouths!!  highly reccomended",

    "text": "Welcome to the next best thing of Chandler, AZ. I can see folks driving across town on a weekend evening to get away with the family and enjoy some amazing dishes.   I am from Colorado, where Cheddars Restaurants are prevalent, so I knew what to expect.   Right now, the restaurant is new so there seem to be a lot of bodies (servers, managers, hosts) but this will change. The service and the overall execution of food delivery will improve over time; I am confident about that.   Let's get going with the knitty-gritty details of the experience I had.   To begin, we walked into the restaurant and the decor and space was beautiful. The hostesses at the front were extremely friendly and smiling at our presence. There seemed to be a manager up at the desk who was trying to run the show, and in my opinion, it was a little overbearing and lacking a genuine feel. Kenna (the manager at the desk) was very knowledgable about the restaurant and the history thereof, but proved to be a little domineering and abrasive during our entire visit. I am all about managers circling the restaurant and interacting with guests, but I witnessed her seat a couple at a table and I wasn't impressed with the work ethic. The man was in a wheelchair and his wife had already sat down, and Kenna could have stayed with the guest and attempted to make him feel comfortable; rather, she stood five feet away and observed him attempt to maneuver in between the chairs to get situated (all while attracting a great deal of attention to his table, which I'm sure is not what he wanted).   The service we personally received was lacking, but this is most likely because of the newness of the servers and the missing experience. Our server was friendly and patient as we decided our entrees and she attempted to make conversation. She took our orders and all seemed well, but after our food arrived, she was no where to be seen until we were ready for the check. We had two other servers attempt to clear our plates and refill our drinks.   During your restaurant visit, your drink should never be empty, and at one point, I had two empty drinks in front of me and no signs of getting them filled again.   My burger was phenomenal. I am a \"plain-Dane\" when it comes to food and drink so my burger was supposed to be plain with cheese and cooked as lightly as possible and it was perfect. The chicken tenders were our appetizer and boy do I recommend those. They were awesome! My girlfriend enjoyed a \"wedding cake\" drink and might I say that their drink prices are also amazing. The restaurant I work in charges twice the amount for drinks. If you can dine at a place with heavy portions AND good prices, do it!   There is one last thing that I would like to comment on. Sometimes at the tables you will find ketchup or salt and pepper or sugar, etc. and regardless of the toppings on the table, they should ALL be full. I had to shake and squeeze the ketchup plenty of times in order to get a pile on my plate. That's a pet peeve of mine, so maybe that's only a complaint I would have.   PS, the music is hip and appropriate and perfectly loud. The bar is completely separate from the dining room which is also nice.   All in all, with the right hosts, the right servers, and the right appetite, you will find happiness.   As always, I share my bill price and the tip I left.   Our bill was around $37 and I left $50. I have high hopes for this place.",

Despite the name, my husband and I tired it because it looked so nice from the outside, the inside looks nice as well, like an upscale diner. It was hands down the worst service we each had ever had. We weren't even mad, you kinda have to laugh plus we felt so sorry for our server, there was a manger going to all the tables surrounding us and apologizing. We attributed that to opening restaurant jitters and went back 3 weeks later. It was exactly the same experience, food was ok, when we finally got what we ordered, which most times we didn't. It's like all the servers there not only are new to serving, but completely new to writing things down and remembering them later.   All in all, this a great place to take people if you are patient and don't want to spend a lot of money. For my money, I'll be going across the parking lot to Mimi's. The money saved isn't worth the headache.",

We didn't stay in the restaurant long enough to be greeted by our waiter. As soon as you walk in there was the most disgusting smell that only got worse as we got to our table. We sat down and decided that wasn't something we could bare to smell while we ate dinner so we left. To me this seems like a cleanliness issue and we won't be returning.",

The last three times were far below par and I have to wonder why the sudden downturn in quality? 6 of our8 entrees were incorrect with all 3 steak being way, way over done. Would have sent them back except it took so long to get our food out the first time that it would have been closing time before any food would have come back out. Ice cold mashed potatoes and fettucini alfredo to boot! What started out as a great restaurant has turned into a huge disappointment. Time to find a new reliable family restaurant!",

Sure, the view is that of a parking lot, but really you can't beat the weather and it was significantly quieter than inside. I will be continuing my visits here and recommend them.   Food wise- the pot pie is really good, citrus glazed salmon is great, the buffalo chicken wrap was good (huge tho, its like getting 2 burritos) and (fun fact) everything is from scratch.   Enjoy",

    "text": "Well.. The food at Cheddar's is really good. This is about the 5th time we've dined there. Every time, the food was expertly cooked.  Our server was attentive and polite.  The bathrooms were impeccable.  I docked them a star because:  1: They only had one option for hot sauce, which is Tabasco. I like Tabasco, but for fried options, I prefer Louisiana.. or any other kind for that matter.  2. The table behind us had a couple with a 1 year old that kept screeching. Our entire meal was ruined by a couple of parents that didn't care about the noise their kid was making.  As we ate, I scanned the room, looking at other people's reactions. Each table within sight had at least 2 patrons that were upset by what was going on.   There was a staff member that was going around asking everyone how their meal was and I heard a couple of people complain, but nothing was done about it. The guy never came by my table to get feedback from us.   Our server asked if we wanted to order dessert. I told her it was too noisy and I declined a menu.   It's a Friday night. People are out trying to have a nice meal after a long week. Granted, the ambient noise level at Cheddar's is pretty high, but the noise this child was making was jarring and just plain unnecessary.   When the staff and management lets things like this happen, it sends a clear message to the patrons. I have been in a couple of restaurants that have successfully put an end to similar situations. Offer them a seat in the patio and a free dessert.  My wife and I have 2 daughters. We know how it is to be parents of young children. One of them was a noisy child. One of us was responsible enough to take my daughter outside until she behaved. If the parents aren't parenting in the restaurant responsibly, then the restaurant should take measures to make sure the rest of the patrons aren't negatively affected by a couple that neglects to keep their child at an acceptable volume.  I like the food at Cheddar's. I will probably return and keep them on a \"short leash\". The first sign of trouble, I will be more proactive and simply walk out, since now I know staff and management will not save my night from parents like the ones I mentioned above.  If the management of Cheddar's is actually reading this, you people need to have a staff meeting about what to do in these situations. This incident happened between 6:50-7:30 on Friday, September 22, 2017. The table in question was located right behind the host station, right in front, and in heard the screeching as I was giving my name to the host, and we looked at each other and acknowledged the noise this child was made, so I know he was aware of the problem. He was just as annoyed as I was.",

You can also choose two sides and I would highly recommend the Mac n cheese as a side dish. As a family, we have tried most of the entrees.  I have had to return both the lemon pepper chicken and sirloin steak due to overcooking. Both times, we were given a replacement meal and the chef came to our table to be sure that we were happy with our replacement. Very professional and appreciated.

But everything else has has been very bland and not good. I got the potato soup... didn't like it all.

    "text": "We finally got to try this Cheddars last night. We had been to one in Florida 11 years ago and really enjoyed it. We went on a Saturday evening around 7, and had about a 30 minute wait which isn't bad at all.  Nice looking, well decorated, dimly lit restaurant. We were seated in a nice booth by the window in the bar area, which was a bonus as we could watch the Olympics while we waited. Our waitress was nice and did a good job with our orders and keeping our drinks well stocked. The food itself was good, plenty of selection and reasonable prices. Although we didn't order a cocktail, they looked good and were a great deal. $5.49 for a mango and berry margarita? And it was big! Looked great!  The reason I am knocking off several stars is because during the course of waiting for our food to arrive, a tiny black ant crawled across my forearm at the table. Hmm, no biggie, it's AZ, bugs happen. I killed it and didn't think much of it. Then I noticed he had friends, about 8-10 of them all together crawling across our table. Seemed to be coming in from the window, as there were none under the table.  I told our waitress, who was bringing our food right then. Didn't make a big deal out of it, my husband used the light on his iPhone to show her the ants, and we discreetly asked to be moved to the high top table in the bar near us. No need to cause a commotion or upset any other diners. Not a huge deal, but seriously, ants on our table? Not something you'd enjoy at a nice dinner out. So, after getting approval from the server working the bar, she agreed to move us. We moved, got our food and enjoyed it for the most part.  My real concern is that the manager never came by, and the server never apologized for the situation. Nothing, not a word. Our dirty dishes sat on that table most of our meal, then a bus boy came and cleared the table, and reset it for the next guests. Yuck! Really? You're going to reseat that table with ants on it? I asked the waitress when she brought our bill if she'd mentioned it to the manager. She started to say \"I will tell him\", then when I said \"I thought he'd come by\", she said \"oh, I told him, he should be by soon\". We sat and waited a while longer, and nothing. No apology, no visit, nada. So, we left.  Very disappointing. I expected more from this restaurant and wanted to like it here. Sadly, the lack of care will lead us to never return and not recommend to our friends. Bugs crawling on your table is just unacceptable and I'm shocked the server and manager don't agree.",

Plus, I had chicken tortilla soup with corn tortilla strips and a ceasar salad that had a tasty crossiant with it.  Later, I returned for dinner.  I ordered a house salad with ranch dressing. Plus, I ordered a chicken pot pie.  I thought the chicken pot pie was delicious.  I looked to see if this restaurant had any other locations because this one is so far away.  I wish there was a location in Glendale, AZ.  I would be a frequent diner.  Unfortunately, there is only one in Tucson.  They have great prices and both of my servers provided great service.",

My wife and I had a great dinner here last night: wonderful food, Tyrell was a very attentive and responsive waiter, loved the room,etc. Then the bill came and what a shock! The cost of my drink order - Jamesons on the rocks had been broken down into two elements: Jameson (<a href=\"mailto:2@5.99\">2@5.99</a>), and Rocks (2@.95)!!! They had charged me $.95 extra per drink for ICE!  I asked our waiter about the charge ( no hostility - he really did do a fine job, and by this time we were laughing about the very thought of an extra for ice). He was apologetic and, I believe a bit embarrassed to tell us that \" that's just how we have to write up drinks\".  We didn't push it. We were in too good of a mood to get into a wrangle over two bucks.   Maybe this is something that has been going on for a while and we just haven't noticed, but we've contacted a number of friends about this and so far they are all as slack-jawed about it as we are. I don't remember seeing a notice on the menus of such charges, but then again we weren't looking for it so we could have missed it.   We'll go again, but next time I'll order my drink neat, and take the ice out of the water glass - or bring my own.",

Being from the South, I know comfort food and this place nailed it.  The broccoli cheese casserole was amazing, salmon was amazing.  Sweet tea which is a comfort food staple was perfect.  Then, of all things Sabrina asked if I saved room for dessert.  I'm like, heck ya, I'm a professional.  I paced myself.  Then she brings out what can only be described as death by chocolate.  She could have wheeled out an insulin pump with it but I'm not sure how to self medicate with one of those.  The whole lunch was great and the manager, Tim, stopped by to check on my progress.  I asked him if he brought a spoon cause it takes a village to finish off that cake.  He let me down, had to do it by myself and I ended up tapping out.

    "text": "Visited for Sunday dinner, the wait was about 15 minutes for a table which was very reasonable with no reservations. Had a coupon for the free chicken tenders with entree which is one of our favorites aside from the queso for an appetizer.   Ordered a Chicken BBQ Platter with a side of mac and cheese, loaded baked potato and upgraded the salad. The sauce on the chicken is spot on and the skin cooked to perfect crispness. The mac and cheese hit the spot and potato good too. Croissants are good but glad you only get one because they are decadent! Would like to see the option to get a side order of onion rings on entrees. We love onion rings, but the appetizer size is just too much to do with everything else.   We tried out the new $4.99 sweet and spicy shrimp appetizer (we got an email advertising for it, but it's not on the menu) and it was well worth it. Shrimp were perfectly cooked and sauce was perfect. Unfortunately we didn't have room for the lettuce wraps that they also had. I hope the shrimp make it to a permanent menu offering.   We ordered the sweetened mango iced tea, which was a little too sweet for my husband, but Travis was an excellent waiter and took care of us - adjusting the sweetness. The strawberry lemonade was delightful - love the little pieces of strawberries in there (also love that it is free refills).   We made it to dessert and tried the hot fudge cake sundae, which is a must do at least once in your life. The cake is a monster, but don't worry you can take it home if you can't finish. This dessert is definitely for sharing. We actually ended up with a lot of leftovers, which is great because there certainly is value for what you pay for. Not only is the food good quality, they don't skimp on the meat, sauces are great, and prices are reasonable (even better when they run specials and coupons - do sign up for their email club).   Our service Sunday was fantastic and Travis was one of the best waiters we have had in a long time; I hope we get him again.   Decor is lovely and a nice place to dine. We will be back.",

I've been to multiple Cheddars in different states and this experience wasn't the greatest to say the least. I was sitting at 110 in the bar area. (Yes I heard the table number we were going to before we sat) Haha. So anyways. The women who was our server was one of those who assumes because my fiance and I are a \"younger\" couple we probably won't tip good. She seemed like she's been there awhile as she didn't write our order down. Which is okay I use to do that all the time. But its all unfortunate because we are both ex servers. Myself 10 years and also a bartender for 3. She had 3 tables and was also working the bar with 2 other women. She paid attention, went back talked, small talked with the family next to us and the older couples multiple times. It was not that \"busy time\" where there were a million people there either. The only and first time we saw her for the first 30 min was to take our order. I wasn't even upset until it got worse. So the butter croissants came out AFTER the food. (Mind you she hasn't been over once.) even after the food came out. & they were cold which means they weren't grabbed right away.. I have THREE server friends who work at cheddars who say its like impossible to not get those out right away. So she finally comes over after already eating. I had also planned on ordering a painkiller.But by then dinner was pretty much whatever. She came over finally we told her the buns came out with the food, she took them away filled my water, and never came back after that. We saw her one time after our order not to apologize not to say anything. She of course was around to bring us the check. Smh. I HATE leaving reviews like this but how hard is it to give ALL of your customers the same treatment??",

My wife ordered a strawberry lemonade and our waiter said \"I'm sorry but we were out of fresh strawberries so I put a syrup in it, if it is OK with you?\"  It had a good taste, and I had ice water which was OK.  I ordered NEW BOURBON GLAZED PORK CHOP 10.99  10 oz. center-cut, bone-in pork chop on a bed of mashed potatoes and topped with bourbon glaze and homemade onion rings.  It was served with one side, I chose coleslaw. My wife had COUNTRY FRIED STEAK 9.99  Hand-breaded served with mashed potatoes, gravy, Southern green beans (we substituted Broccoli Cheese Casserole), Texas toast, and an order of Honey Butter Croissants, 3 for 2.99 which were very good, warm, flakey and gooey sweet!  Both our mashed potatoes were luke warm, the broccoli casserole was too and didn't have a good flavor.  The glaze on my chop was very good as were the small mound of onion rings.  The pork, however, was mostly tough and lukewarm as well.  The cole slaw was very good.  Overall I don't think it is worth returning to try something else.",

We are regulars here and only once I sent a steak back and they brought out a newly fresh grilled one. Not just heated the one sent back.  That right there is quality.  Love this place. Chicken fingers are handmade. Croissant and cake. Cookie are sinful.  8 ounce sirloin and 3-4 chicken fingers with two sides $14. And it's lean and good. (Example of good price for food)",

    "text": "Cheddar's is a nice family restaurant with an upscale layout and reasonably priced menu.  While they have a large menu, the best options tend to be comfort foods such as chicken tenders, fried shrimp, homemade onion rings, etc.  The portions are very large and the food does feel somewhat heavy.  They have a full bar and the desserts all looked good.  The service was pretty good, and though there were several errors everything was corrected easily.  On the way out they gave my kids cookies which was certainly a big hit.  I consider Cheddar's in the Applebees's class of restaurants, but definitely put it one grade higher.",

We ordered the onion rings with two types of dipping sauces for our appetizer and the onion rings were too greasy for me. We also ordered the Nachos and Queso which was excellent.  I ordered the chicken tenders with shrimp along with french fries and coleslaw as my two sides. They did not bring my coleslaw nor my chicken tenders.  My waiter apologized and brought them to me. My daughter's and I shared dessert which was very good.  Even though my order was not complete I would still recommend and visit again. The food is good. My daughter's and I enjoyed ourselves.",

The food came out fast and was super good. I can see why the place was so busy. I only had to wait 10 minutes which was fine. It gave me a chance to look over the menu. The menu has many different options to choose from. Plus they offer a \"lighter \" portion if you want to go that route. I had the Strawberry lemonade with actual strawberries in it. I would recommend that drink. For food I had the salmon with the bourbon glaze. It was so yummy. The sides were delicious too. I felt like I was eating at grandmas house.

So for the food: Queso and chips for signing up added bonus totally unexpected. My food the Cajun pasta great, Shawn went out of his way to make sure it was spicy. No complaints here what so ever.  My date all had a great experience the bourbon glazed salmon, she loved it. Not sure about the negative reviews here but I would ignore them completely. We had a great time with great food. To management: I would suggest promoting Shawn to a trainer, he deserves it!  We will be back soon, thanks guys!!!!!!!!!!",

Be weary of the red beans and rice, it's a little too watery for my taste.   I come here all the time with my family or with friends, it's a great place to enjoy a meal.",

My wife ordered the ribs, but found that the sauce was too tangy/spicy for her taste. There was not a thing wrong with them, just a matter of taste. Our server graciously brought her a menu to pick something else. The manager also came by the table to make sure that we were taken care of. This was all so nicely done, very classy.

Love the margaritas ( so cheap and good) and the chicken tenders, steak, and Cesar salad are also great.   Also just an update from my last post. I posted about a waitress and she found me on Yelp and commented on my post! (I didn't approve the comment because she just made excuses). I thought that was soooooo unprofessional!

We decided we wanted to go somewhere with a good selection of food where we could talk and have a meal together. There were going to be 9 in our party so a couple of my family members went early to get our name on the list. They handed us a pager and we proceeded to all meet in the bar and stood around a tiny table. They would not seat us until there was at least 6 of our party there. When 5 arrived we checked on the table as it had been about an hour at this point. The hostess alerted us that the other party members had already been seated. We went back but much to our surprise they had not seated our party they had given our table away. They questioned us and asked us if we were sure!!!! Uh yea we know who we were going to meet for dinner!!! Turns out the hostess didn't check the pager and it wasn't working. We sat a little longer in the bar and asked to speak to the manager. She came up and basically told us the same thing.....we all looked at each other like DUH idiot we know there's someone sitting at our table but what are you going to do about it? She told us basically we would just have to wait. We found it hard to believe that there wasn't a single other section where you could put two tables together. Most of us are pretty irate by now because it's been an hour and forty five minutes. The manager tried to smooth things over by telling us when we got seated, if ever at this point we could have free appetizers. We questioned her again about what she could do because really none of us wanted to even eat there. We decided to walk out and will not ever go back to that restaurant again. Talk about a lack of communication and mismanagement. I'd give half a star if I could. I worked in the food service industry and have never encountered such an incompetent manager.",

However when I looked up to see if I could reserve a table as a call ahead the website said I could, when I called this bitchy lady answered and she said \"excuse me we don't do that.\" One, no need to be rude about it and two, I did that two weeks ago.  I'm not sure what changed in two weeks but regardless you should update the website, and get less bitchy receptionist. I also over heard one of your servers say \"I'm over this place.\" Might wanna work on making your servers happy because they're the face of your restaurant.",

Tried the spinach appetizer. Hot, gooey from the melted mozzarella melted on top and simply delish. Came with a salsa that was amazing. Wife got a burger with bacon and onion rings inside. I got the philly steak sandwich. Most time when you get the philly they use canned sliced mushrooms. Not here! Nice, fresh buttons split in half and sauteed perfectly. Server was exceptionally attentive. I would definitely recommend!",

After months and months of waiting for acknowledgment from Cheddar's about this issue, Cheddar's response is \"6/16/2016  Hi Carey, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We would like to have someone reach out to you personally, so please send us a private message with your contact information. Thank you.\"  First of all, send you a private message where? Secondly, what about the two previous private messages I sent using the FEEDBACK survey on the receipt and the email I sent directly using the CONTACT US form on your web-site? Both of which were ignored.  I'm right here. Feel free to say publicly what you want to say to me privately. No national franchise charges tax on a tip. Go eat at Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Texas Roadhouse, Applebee's, Chili's, Cheesecake Factory... literally anywhere in the country and see for yourself.  Financially penalizing your customers for leaving a gift to their server is INSANE and discourages a generous gift.  I hope you order a pizza some day and when the delivery driver brings it to your door and you tip the delivery driver $5, I hope the delivery driver says to you, \"Oh, if you're going to tip me $5, you have to give me $5.50 to cover the sales tax.\" I just want to see how outraged you are. Surely the simple solution is to take the $5 back and not leave any tip at all. I already pay tax on my income, I shouldn't have to pay tax on the servers income, too.  What is there to talk about? There is no precedent for this practice. There is no excuse for it. There is nothing to discuss. Change the deceitful and anti-consumer practice of charging tax on a tip. If and when you do, please let me know and I'll give you future business. Until then, I'm warning everyone I know to pay attention to the receipt they get at your establishment that literally NO OTHER NATIONAL FRANCHISE condones, practices or endorses.  Thank you. I look forward to your public response here.",

All sorts of drink specials like Texas Margarita at $3.99 for a giant salt rimmed refreshing lip smacking drink. Started off with the croissants piping hot smothered in honey!  Then had the dinner portion of fried and battered chicken breasts, 2 monsters crispy and piping hot over Texas toast smothered in peppery white gravy of the gods.  Side of garlic mashed and southern green beans overfilling the plate.  Loved this dish and brought half home for under $25, wow.  Place was packed with happy satisfied customers, including me.",

The hostess didn't impress me because she didn't bother asking for my name or greeting me. Just asked \"how many?\" And gave me a beeper. Once it went off, she just yelled party of 2!? It would have been better if she had said my name. I dunno. One of those things.  Our server was great! I thought the idea of having the card with some info about our server like their fav entree was a cool touch. Something I hadn't seen before   We ordered the small bacon cheese fries and cheese curds for apps. Omg sooo much bacon on the fries. They did not skimp. The cheese curds were great, they had a light panko crust on them that made them super crispy.  Meal wise my husband had the ribs and chicken tenders. I had the mango salsa tilapia and  shrimp. Ribs were tender and tasty and chicken tenders were sooo good. They had a light batter on them and were not greasy. It's funny because I wouldn't think of ordering them but they were really good.   My mango salsa tilapia was super tasty. Seasoning was just right. I had a side of Broccoli and Mac n cheese. Broccoli was bland but it was steamed broccoli so can't say that wasn't expected. But mixed it in with the Mac n cheese and it was great lol.   Overall this place was very good. Service was great. Not at all what I had expected. Pricing is very very reasonable. Burgers for $6!! Definitely will be back.",

I thought I'd try it out and see why they are so popular in the southern states. Great looking restaurant with some neat decor (love the aquarium). Just a little on the dark side when it comes to lighting. The server did a good job, but I didn't care for the \"homemade\" queso appetizer. I've made better at home and the presentation of it wasn't the greatest. But I will say the chicken tenders and the chicken fried steak were fantastic. The meat in the CFS was tender and the outside was nice and crispy. It's a nice family restaurant that fits in perfectly with Chandler culture so I give it a slight thumbs up.",

If you like being transferred to the bar multiple times to place a to go order this is your place.   I recently called to place a to go order at night and was immediately transferred to the bar like they usually do. I was on hold for a couple minutes just for someone to answer and greet me again asking what I needed. I explained I still needed to place a to go order. When I finally got the right person to take my order (I'm assuming he bartender) they acted as if I was an I convenience. (We will see how inconvenient I am when I don't leave a tip because of poor service). When I arrive I walk into the bar and ask the bartender why I was transferred twice. The reply: \" well it's busy\" and \"I don't know why the hostess doesn't take your order they have he ability to\". The bar wasn't even busy (unless 3 tables and 2-3 employees in the bar is overwhelming). I was super discouraged by the service I received considering BJ's Brewery has better food and better service for a little higher price and is 2 Min away from the chandler location. But maybe I have to pay to get good service and not expect it at this location. I was told someone was going to reach out to me but that hasn't happened yet. 2 stars because the food tasted good.",

    "text": "I enjoyed myself! My fiance works in the same plaza and I mentioned to her that I wanted to try this place so a few nights ago she suggested we meet up there after she got off. On the outside and on the inside, it looks like a really nice restaurant like I'm new to the foodie game but I thought this place was pretty swanky. So imagine my surprise when I saw the menu and the prices - extremely, extremely reasonable. Like how TGIFriday's used to be before it got all snobby and overpriced on us. Maybe I'm just used to NY prices but nothing on the menu was over $14 if I recall correctly. The menu was typical American fare: burgers, sandwiches, salads, steak, seafood, and some pastas. We skipped the appetizer and my fiance ordered the bacon cheeseburger. It was cooked well, tasted good, I really enjoyed her fries. They weren't too crunchy and they were seasoned well, not overly salty. I ordered the New Orleans pasta. The bread it came with was delicious (of course) and it wasn't too spicy to where my mouth was on fire. It was just enough. It had sausage, chicken, and shrimp. The chicken looked weird, like, I made my fiance try it to make sure it was chicken and before she tasted it she assured me it was sausage and it wasn't. So chicken that looks like sausage was a little weird for me for it tasted good. I took half of it home and ate it for dinner the next day and it tastes even better. We ordered the monster cookie for dessert and we weren't really feeling it. It was like a chocolate chip butter cookie, it was brittle on the sides and didn't have a cookie taste or feel to it. They're made to order which was fine for us but we're BIG fans of the pizookie from BJ's and that was no pizookie. Overall, I would definitely go back. Our waiter, Mike, was so nice and his demeanor was cool as a cucumber, I bet he never gets mad, lol. Next time, however, I'll ride with my fiance so that I can drink because that Painkiller drink looked delicious and the 2 per customer limit really has me intrigued.",

Then our waitress came to take our drink order and after she was there and he commented \"does everyone here hate their jobs\". Our food came out fast, and was delivered by someone who wasn't our server and our server was cleaning the booth behind us and asked from there if we needed anything else. Our drinks were never refilled, and our server did not come by at all after our food was dropped off. I was waiting to ask for a dressing but she never came back. Finally, we get our bill at give her the gift card. She comes back and says it is not working and just stands there like we are trying not to pay. My husband gave her our debit card and we pay and leave. We call the number of the back of the gift card from the parking lot and it says we have $25 on it. So now we are still stuck with this gift card. Food was cheap, but service was awful.",

As noted in many of the reviews, the menu is stocked full of american comfort food and I certainly made sure I got my fill.  We ordered the two most popular appetizers on the menu.  The Wisconsin Cheese Bites and the Chips and Queso.  Both were delicious!!     I love baked potato soup- so gave that a try to and it was also very good.  There was plenty of food so we all kind of picked at the main course dishes which consisted of the monte cristo sandwhich and the chicken tenders.    Everything was really good, the restaurant was clean and the ambience comfortable.  The price was what you would expect around 9$ for the meals.    Only reason I didn't give the full 5 stars here was for the service.  The waiter was nice but didn't check on us after taking our order.  We had to grab him to get refills after I food arrived.  If we order appetizers pre meal- we most likely will need those drinks refilled by the time the meal arrives.  We only saw him again when he was ready to give us our check.  Not a huge deal, but they werent very busy when we were there so it was a little disappointing.    I will definitely go back- I would like to try the ribs and we had a good experience all in all.",

The salad was iceberg lettuce with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Service admitted it was her first day. The service could have been great and the food would still have made this place not somewhere we will return. Prices weren't bad, but food quality w",

I went with the scratch bacon cheeseburger, one went with the Monte Cristo as mentioned and ten the other went with the Philly Cheesesteak.   Overall good came out quick and was well prepared. Nothing really blew us out of the water so it was 'okay'. I like my burger medium and it was pretty cooked but then realized I didn't get an option (which is not uncommon).

Very cool fish aquarium, several large screen LCDs. Watching the NBA playoffs. The lighting nice. Not to bright or dark, perfect.  First up, a tall glass of Blue Moon, $5.49, and a Margarita on the rocks (huge glass), $4,49. Yes, the price is good. They don't do happy hour pricing, makes sense I guess. We split the appetizer, Triple Threat Sampler, skins, fried curds, and chicken, $10.19. My favorite food for the whole meal came from this dish, the Wisconsin Cheese Bites. Better than Culver's. One reoccurring theme throughout the food we  had is the batter used, crisp, light, tasty, non-oily.  For dinner we split the Country Fried Steak, and sides. We choose the Broccoli Cheese Casserole and Mac/Cheese, $9.99. The steak was hugh, batter again perfectly fried. The gravy was ok, could of used more on the side. The steak was laid over the  Texas toast, which was okay. The Broccoli Casserole was very good, Mac and Cheese was okay. I guess I was expecting more flavor. For the price, no complaints.  Dessert, the seasonal Crisp A LA Mode. Vanilla ice cream, cinnamon, caramel sauce, apple crisp, $5.49. This dessert was huge and very good.  Went to the bathroom when I first got there, both paper towel holders had no paper towels. On my way out I mentioned it to Jason the restaurant manager, he said ok, and took care of it. Later on he stopped by our table and asked how everything was, I told him in so many words too good, and the price is a right. He was friendly, left and came back with some warm cookies, nice touch.Caitlyn our server was very friendly, helpful and there when we needed her. The food came out pretty quick for being busy. Our side dish was not correct,  she took care of it right away.   For the ambiance, price, quality of food, and service, too good. We will be back.",

They must've changed their recipes or something because all the food tasted completely different than before. They pride themselves on their chicken tenders being flaky and delicious but they were in fact quite the opposite. It tasted rubbery with too much batter, I was having high school cafeteria flashbacks. And apparently they consider onions and salt as \"seasoning\" for their rice. Absolutely no flavor. Extremely Disappointing. Cannot see myself returning  in the near future as much as I hate to say it.",

The only time I've ever seen or dined at a Cheddar's was in Dallas, TX.  The minute I saw it I made up my mind to dine there for dinner after running my errands. I ordered the Combo Chicken Tenders and Shrimp with a loaded baked potato and a salad with Honey Mustard Dressing. I've only been to Cheddar's twice and ordered the same thing both times.  I looked over the menu for a while with hopes of trying something new but when the server came to take our order she immediately told us the list of items they were out of for the evening.  I can't remember what they were but I was considering one of them.  They did not however, run out of dinner rolls *smile*  Good Lord the dinner rolls!  In addition to the few food items they were out of for the evening, they were also out of Strawberry lemonade.  I thought that was pretty strange.  We were able to order one strawberry lemonade for the both of us (my boyfriend and I) but when we asked for refills they were all out.  Bummer!",

    "text": "When I first saw the Cheddars had gone in at this location I assumed it was a nicer restaurant with higher prices. Then I looked on Yelp and read all the wonderful reviews and found out it was very reasonably priced so I decided to check it out. I finally got there and decided to splurge since it was my birthday week and order the steak dinner. It wasn't too big of a splurge because the steak dinner was only $10.79 before tax . That's a pretty darn good price for a steak dinner .  I only really dealt with two people, the girl who seated me and my waitress, but both were very pleasant and cheerful. I looked over the menu decided on a steak dinner, medium rare, with my two sides of mashed potatoes and green beans cooked with ham.   The food arrived expeditiously and the first thing I noticed was when I put the fork in the meat it slid right in showing me that the meat must be pretty tender. The knife also glided right through the meat so I was instantly impressed. I had been to the Outback 2 or 3 times in the previous months and got one of their steak specials and could not even get the fork to pierce the meat it was so tough. I also felt like a lumberjack trying to saw through the meat with the knife at the Outback and had determined not to go back . This surprised me because the theme of that restaurant its steaks.   Back to the Cheddars steak, it was an 8 ounce compared to the 6 ounce at either Sizzler or Outback, was cooked perfectly, nice and red inside, and was incredibly tender and delicious. The potatoes were obviously homemade. The green beans were delicious.  I got back there a couple of other times before I left town. One time I got the whitefish and it was delicious.  I learned to like whitefish while I was in Michigan and although the Whitefish here is not quite as good as it was in Michigan it was still well worth getting.   I was gone from the area for a couple of years and I looked forward to coming to Cheddars when I returned. My daughter and I came in here the other night and I got the whitefish again. It's still had wonderful flavor although the top was a little dried out which made it hard to cut through. You don't get a choice of vegetables now but what it came with, rice and a nice salad, was very good so that was okay. The price was still very reasonable. It looks like the steak prices might have gone up a bit since I was here before though.   I'd still love to come back and try another one of their steaks and probably will soon. If we had a Cheddar's in San Diego I imagine I would patronize it often. The atmosphere is almost like that of a more expensive restaurant and the service has always been good. I definitely would recommend this place for others",

    "text": "Pretty average experience. I came here with my family on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. Due to our somewhat large party, we sat outside on the patio. With the restaurant being short staffed at the moment we only had one waiter. (They had \"we are hiring\"signs around the restaurant) He was kind and worked well but made a few mistakes with our orders and wasn't around as much as he should've been to offer refills or to see if we were all good. My food overall was okay...I got the grilled buffalo chicken wrap and it wasn't that great. The chicken inside was in big chunks and the cheese wasn't melted at all which made it unpleasant to eat. One thing that stood out to me was that the staff would take their breaks on the patio as well which made it awkward to eat while the kitchen staff or servers were sitting around us and decompressing.   One factor that was good about the restaurant were the prices. Pretty affordable menu with a variety of appealing options.   Overall pretty average experience but might be willing to give it another shot.",

    "text": "The service and management at this location were beyond terrible.  We went out as a group of 5 during lunch on a Friday.  Seated right away, which was nice, a waitress came by a few minutes later.  My one friend asked about the beers and was told by the waitress she does not know the drink menu, sorry.  Ok, we looked at the menu ourselves but instead of asking the bar tender, she just retorted with I don't know.  My other friend can not have breaded foods so asked if it was possible to have chicken fingers grilled not fried.  She then just stared at him responded again with Yea I know know.  My friend said well can you please ask?  Our drinks were brought by and no straws, I had to ask her for the straws.  We placed our order and instead of giving my friend an answer (who by now just decided on a salad) she just suggested a totally different item, deflecting from what he asked her.  Over 35 minutes went by for some chicken wraps, a salad and a fish and chips.  When the food came, my wrap was correct while my one friends was not.  They also forgot one of the salads.  At this point, we did not have much more time left, so my friend said she would keep the wrap given and proceeded to pick it up.  It was grabbed FROM her and told it was someone else's food.  She told the server \"yes but I already touched it\" and they still took it to another table.  Now she waits another 10 minutes for them to make HER wrap- to go.  AT this point she asked for a manager who came over hot and ready to argue.  No management skills.  No training on conversations with clients.  Just simply was condescending to my friend and cut off each time she explained her case and ended it with \"we are making you one to go will THAT make you happy\".  No one else got a discount on their botched food or terrible service.  I suggest to the District Manager that you send the Friday afternoon Female Manager back to training whoever she is (as a manger I always introduced myself to a client first, that did not happen in this case).  I will not return here ever again.  Sorry your staff feels the burden to help their tables.",

Be prepared for poor service and plan on extra time because everything takes longer then it should and you even have to ask for drinks refills and remind the server of your order!

    "text": "This review is only about the incredible service of Michael Dunn.   (Cheddar's Chandler)   It took two weeks to think of the perfect words to express the outstanding service that was bestowed upon my aunt and I, by our entertaining and professional waiter Michael Dunn. I have never had a dinning experience like this ever in my 30 years and I'm 30. (Not even my mother served me as well as him and she burped me...Ha.) All jokes aside, I have been to several 5 star restaurants that did not have his amazing passion for customer service. I have been to Cheddar's a couple times,  the food is always wonderful and service is always friendly....... But Michael Dunn is a God send. He needs to train other people in the art of serving. Not only was he extremely professional, he had a personality that was entertaining and welcoming. Michael is amazing. My aunt and I agree that we will only be served by him from now on. The other staff is wonderful, but once you have the Michael experience you are addicted. He is so attentive it is unmatched in comparison to other outside dining experiences I've encountered. He spoke so highly of the restaurant and is definitely management material. He will surely have successful and bright future with any endeavor he takes on! Michael Dunn is the answer to everything!!! We will be seeing him very soon for another ultimate dining experience!!!   This is just a small summary to describe this Man's service,  but there are no words that can tell you the experience I had. You just have to experience his service yourself.   Jenae F.",

    "text": "DONT GO!!! Where to start... One of the poorest experience I have had in my life. We inform them that we were on our lunch hour , they took our order (after informing us that we couldn't place the order over the phone prior to our arrival ) after ignoring us for about five minutes the waitress followed us from the table to the bar, and took our order. She came back about three minutes later informed us that she had to transfer it to the bar staff, after 20 minutes we asked the bar staff (Nick to be specific) where our order was, he informed us that he would go check and after returning seven minutes later we asked if we could get it to go( at this time we are now 35 minutes into our order/stay, still no water, no soup, no acknowledgment). We asked Nick if we could speak to the manager , who proceeded to take his time coming over, and another five minutes wasted, The manager Chuck McMalton made it to us, with no expression on his face just nodded and walked off after hearing her complaint. A few minutes later we received our order and our bills. I proceeded to take my food and walk to the front desk to request the manager again, at this time the bartender Nick proceeded to freak out thinking I was stealing his food and started talking smack about me to the rest of the patrons in the bar. The manager , finally made his way to me, now keep in mind we are 45 minutes into our lunch & this does not include our drive time, The manager proceeds to snatch aggressively the bag of food out of my hand and in for me I was still to pay for my beverage. This staff was so aggressively rude, inconsiderate, and unprofessional. Other customers and staff were highly shocked at their behavior towards us. They handed out more excuses as to why it wasn't their fault. The manager was 'suppose' to behave in a professional manner. Chuck literally snatched the bag of food out of my hand as if I was a criminal, all while maintained my composure and I was politely and quietly trying to express my concerns with his lack of ownership or empathy. Btw we were late arriving back to our employer by 20 minutes due to this fiasco and we never received any service nor hot food.",

Our server was awesome, kept our drinks filled at all times, gave great recommendations, and was basically just on the top of his game. My baby was a bit fussy and servers, bussers, and even a manager stopped by just to say hi to her. The service was seriously the best!  And holy crap the prices... we were very surprised at how decently priced everything was! The food wasn't \"out of this word\" or anything, but it was pretty yummy!  We ordered the Santa Fe spinach dip as a starter and then I got the chicken pot pie and my husband got ribs and chicken tenders. The portions were huge and we went home with a lot of leftovers! Then the manager came over and said welcome to cheddars(since it was our first time) and brought us freshly baked cookies for free! It was awesome! Anyway, we left SUPER full and we will definitely be back!",

The ribs was the best part of the whole meal. They were half rack BBQ dry rub ribs, and they were very yummy. Had a lot of flavor to them. They were very very tender, falling off the bone. This was my first meal from them and so far so good.  The price was about $12 and some change. I hope it's like this or better every time I go.",

Once you place your order, you'd be thankful to see your server before your meal arrives to ensure you're doing okay. Last week our server took our order and we didn't see her again until about 20 minutes after the manager brought out our meals. The steak was overcooked and not \"medium\" as I had ordered. It was so dry that I dipped it in the sauce that comes with the grilled shrimp. This place has so much potential if the service would improve.

    "text": "I haven't been to a Cheddar's in about ten years, with the last one I visited being in San Angelo, TX. I remember the food being bar-ish, with no real interesting sway working for or against my palette. So to my surprise, this Cheddar's food was very good.  The appetizer we ordered was the Spinach Dip. It was good... Served SUPER fast (literally, we ordered it, had a few sentences of conversation, and it was delivered from the back). It got to our table so fast, we both paused in disbelief and said \"whoa\". The dip itself was a bit full of spinach, but arguably, it's called \"Spinach Dip\" not \"Cream with a little hint of spinach\". This was a welcomed change to the appetizer and it was 4.5 stars. The chips provided with the dip were delicious - thin, warm, crispy, and fresh tasting - not stale from sitting under a heat lamp like some other restaurants. We didn't have enough chips to cover the dip, but I'll explain more on that later.   I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak sub Steamed Brocolli instead of green beans, and my girlfriend got the Grilled Baja Chicken as described in the menu. The portion for the Chicken Fried Steak was abundant, and the way it was prepared was great. The crust on the CFS was golden, flaky, and flavorful without being overly heavy in battered flavor... I think it might have been a light egg-wash and flour mixture... whatever it was, it was perfect. The actual meat of the CFS was perfect, not too dry, not too greasy from the frying process. And it was piping hot. The white gravy that was on the CFS and garlic-mashed potatoes was fantastic, as well... I actually wish they had given me more, but found that the meal was still fantastic without it. The garlic-mashed potatoes were also great... from scratch, with some of the skin still apparent, just like my grandmother used to make.  I tried the dish my girlfriend had, the Grilled Baja Chicken from the \"Lighter Side\" part of the menu; this was on point, as well. For a Baja-described dish, I was expecting it to taste heavy, like it would hit my stomach like most spanish-american inspired meals often do because of the heavy amounts of oils in the food. This was not the case at all. The chicken was light and flavorful, with the right amount of spices to bring out the flavor of the savory, juicy chicken, without burying it to the point that you can't taste the rest of your food. The black beans were a nice touch and melded well in the mouth with the chicken and the rice.Very well done, indeed. 5 Stars  For dessert, we ordered the Peach Cobbler. It was warm and gooey, while the caramel drizzled vanilla ice cream was cold and perched on top... I was pretty full from eating just half of the Chicken Fried Steak meal, but we managed to eat most of the dessert and it was wonderful! It came out super fast, and was a great ending to our meal.  Now the one thing that stood out above everything else was the service. We had \"Juste\" (pronounced \"yoo-stuh\") as our server. It was fantastic all around. She never let our drinks dip below half-way before automatically refilling them, without us having to flag her down from across the restaurant or catch her as she was flying by. As the chips to our appetizer were getting low, she brought us a hot refill of chips without us even mentioning it. Our waters were instantly replaced at half-way... Juste worked stealthily, allowing my girlfriend and I a chance to carry on a good conversation without worrying about our drinks being low. She was fast on everything; everytime she asked if we needed something, if we made a request, it was immediately fulfilled, without waiting for her to go around to the entire restaurant to save herself trips to the kitchen. That made a huge difference in service time for us and we thank her tremendously for that. She was also smiling and seemed to enjoy being there, which made for an instant pleasantry while she was engaging us to fulfill her duties. Her service was so good that we felt compelled to tell the manager about our positive experience. If we could give her 1000 stars, we most certainly would.  Having read some of the other recent reviews, I find myself wondering if we were just super lucky tonight... did the planets align? I don't believe in that nonsense... I attribute our fantastic dining experience to Juste's impeccable serving abilities - making sure our orders were right, delivered fast, and that our table was never left waiting for anything at any moment. It is thanks to her that we will most definitely be returning again. We HIGHLY recommend this Cheddar's - if their entire serving staff performs as well as Juste, this restaurant will never disappoint you.",

We went on a Friday evening and it was packed as usual. But the wait was not too bad. Staff was really fast and friendly. Inside is nicely decorated and modern. Huge fish tank in middle of restaraunt. We started with the queso and chips. It was so good we ordered 2 orders. The chips were fresh, crisp, and light not greasy at all. We ordered the queso with ground beef, it was seasoned perfectly. It also comes with a mild salsa,also pretty good. Ribs & Shrimp: Melt in your mouth ribs, crispy seasoned shrimp  Philly Cheesesteak: Stuffed with tender meat and loads of cheese Chicken Fingers: lightly fried, not too much batter, very juicy Oh and the cocktails!! Painkiller: Must Try! Creamy, and fruity you def dont taste any alcohol  Sweet Tea: Sweet and lemony! Strong but good! I hope that they expand more West! I would be a regular!",

Any how we were quite impressed and pleased with our waitress Elizabeth here at the chandler location she gave out such great customer service so we hope she gets recognized for that and anyone who's looking to dine here ask for Elizabeth and tip her!!!   Thank you Cheddars Scratch Kitchen for a 5 Star Service,   Love the Ustic family.",

What a lousy experience. The quality & service has definitely gone downhill! We sat for about 10 minutes before our server even greeted us. Took our drink order, came back about 10 minutes later and asked my girlfriend what she had ordered again cause he couldn't read his own handwriting. Now going on 20 minutes without even a drink! I ordered my usual, steak came out well done when I ordered it medium. Mac and cheese side was cold! My girlfriend had baby carrots for her side that never came out. Server was nowhere to be found throughout the meal, didn't even stop to ask how everything was. I got up and walked to the manager for her carrots and the water I ordered 20 minutes prior. Truly disappointing! Don't think we will be returning!",

The entire menu is made from scratch and it's easy to tell. Super fresh and tasty food. All of the sides are my personal favorite. They have an option on the menu where you whole meal can just be a bunch of sides... amazing.  I would personally recommend any of the potatoes, the Mac and cheese, the corn, or the broccoli cheddar casserole (so so so good)!",

The manager was horrible...didn't seem to know how to address the situation either time. The server never came back after the second time. We waited 20 mins after the 2 finished their meals and had to have another employee find the manager to see if we were getting a bill...while our server stood a few feet away talking to another employee. The manager did end up \"comping\" the meals. Have never had an experience this bad at any restaurant anywhere...ever. Oh...also the women's bathroom had no towels and no one ever \"serviced\" it the whole time we were there.",

Our server was pretty awesome, super nice, apparently half of my table have had her as a server before and says she's super consistent with great service, I'd believe it. She recommend for me to do the rib and chicken entree, and told me how delicious, tender and juicy all the meats were, so of course I had to get it.  Food came out and looked amazing! Went to cut into my rib, so I wouldn't be too barbaric, my knife wouldn't cut through the meat!   Right on time, our server came by and I asked her if it was suppose to be like this,* tries penetrating the meat with my fork, wouldn't go through* \"oh wow, no that never happens,  let me take it back and get you a new one!\" Manager comes over introduced himself and asked about our food,  as soon as I opened my mouth to tell him, his demeanor already started to change and didn't seem like he cared to even hear me out. My new plate came out and he asked me to cut into this one, it was a tad more tender, and I basically told him it was fine, I didn't want to waste more food. He apologized and left.  As I cut into it some more and ate it,  the meat was extremely dry, like frost bite or overcooked in the microwave then dried out. Safe to say I wasn't going to eat that, just ate my chicken and sides then left.[ even took pix of my ribs to show my bf how not to ever cook our ribs at home]  They took half of my meal off and I paid the rest. I might come back, but won't be ordering ribs.  Their chicken was yum though!",

    "text": "Cheddar's is like any other chain restaurant at this price level.  Not bad.  Not great either.  Do I ever regret eating there?  No.  Am I really excited to go back?  No.  Well, maybe for a couple of things.  About a month ago my husband and I stopped in for dinner.  I ordered the ribs and fried shrimp and he ordered the sirloin and chicken tenders.  The beer choices were really not that interesting.  He ended up with a Sam Adams Oktoberfest and said it went well with his meal.  Now, here's where I get excited.  The Texas Sweet Tea.  That is one tasty adult beverage, and at $3.79 a very good price.  I could get really ornery on a few of those.  I also love their warm croissants.  Three of those are $2.99 and they are delicious!  My ribs were a little dry but the fried shrimp was good.  Nice and lightly breaded, and not overcooked.  My side of mac and cheese was delicious, but very small.  About 3 bites.  The green beans were flavorless, like they had been sitting in water all day.  My husband had ordered the sirloin med rare and it came out med well.  Just ugh.  It was edible, but just barely.  The chicken tenders were ok, but seemed like they had been sitting for awhile.  His side of broccoli was good.  Overall it's just a real \"meh\" experience for us.  John took great care of us in the bar.  He was busting his butt taking care of customers at the bar and in the booths like we were.  He's 5 stars all the way, but when we were finished, the total with tip was close to $55.  While we were walking to the car I asked my husband if he felt that was a 50-dollar meal.  He said, \"No way.  Should have gone to Firebirds for that amount of money.\"  I totally agree.  I could see us stopping in for a couple of drinks or something, but the food just doesn't excite me.  There are some much better places right across the street.",

There is one saiad on the GF menu, a chicken salad with candied pecans, but you have to skip the pecans and can only get balsamic vinaigrette or french dressing.  None of that sounded good, so I wound up ordering a bun-less burger and fries.  It was okay - it was a huge burger so it was filling, but the bacon on it was too salty.  They have a kid's menu with plenty of options - the mac n cheese was too fancy for my daughter - it had a bread crust on top and the apples with yogurt is chopped up green apples mixed with yogurt and golden raisins.  My son said it was very tart.",

We sat at the booths closest to the kitchen all we could hear was a loud female yelling at her staff at the top of her lungs!  Our food took 30 minutes and when it did arrive, both my steak and my husbands steak was burnt!!  We asked for a manager, twice.  When she finally came to the table I could tell by her voice she was the one screaming like a banshee in the kitchen.  She never apologized just took our plates and said we would have new ones right out.  After another 30 minutes we left.  The hostess said nothing to us upon our exit.  We will never return.  The service was horrible! Some hispanic girl with huge eyebrows kept touching our glasses by the rim! YUCKY!!!!!",

Worst experience ever!!! it took our waiter a good 30-35 minuets to get our drink order which he ended up messing that up and after he took the drink order he told us to \"not play musical chairs\" why this was said to 12 adults as if we were at a party I have no clue. The waiter ran of and then came the manager asking if we had a problem with out waiter and if we wanted  a new one which we said yes too and walked away...well 10 minutes later here comes the same damn waiter with the incomplete and incorrect drink order. We go on he try's to correct it the another 10 minutes go by and he's ready for the food order which he repeated correctly but when we got the food 5 out of 12 of us didn't get half of our food. We asked for condiments and butter which he kept forgetting which was expected for the way the night had already played out. Not to mention we were sat in a corner where there was no air at all so we asked them to open the door on the patio which they did. Needless to say the service was crap and the food was blah so I will not be back here. We get better service at Denny and our orders are correct!",

My husband hadn't eaten all day and was only able to choke down half of the gray colored jalapeno burger. I was super excited about their baked spagetti. However half way through I started feeling sick to my stomach. Being a vegetarian I asked the waitress again if they had used chicken stock or any meat product. She assured me they hadn't & then told me she hoped my day got better. My response was that my day is fine & I hoped their food got better. Also everything from the bread to the corn was so butter slathered that not even my 4 year old would eat one of her favs, corn. We were also seated next to the door to the patio and had servers going in & out to smoke. When they started seating the patio everyone had to come past or even stand next to our table where 3 people asked me what I was eating.. this was a horrible experience from front to back. If you want to enjoy your dining experience do not go to Cheddar's.",

    "text": "Heard good things about the place and decided to try it out. Hostess was very rude, asked for a table and a high chair as we our 6 month old Granddaughter with us. Directed us to a table in the very busy center section of the restaurant surrounded by senior citizens. I politely asked her to sit somewhere else as I would not want to disturb if she was to get fussy. Nothing against seniors but they do tend to get a little annoyed when they are relaxing and socializing. She got irritated and said well I have one table in the bar area, I said that was fine and she rudely asked an employee on a break to get up and move. Once we ordered we received half of our order and quickly the server explained her error which was not a problem since it was a whole rib order and she would bring out the other half. When my Husband took a bite of his broccoli he bit into a small 1 inch strip of a purple plastic thing..not too mention the broccoli didn't look that great, the second helping they brought looked much better. Also the order of ribs we did get were cold and didn't seem fresh at all, I thought it was just us but the couple next to us had the same issue with theirs. The manager came out ....at our request to apologize and make it right. We thought she had mentioned a discount for our inconvenience which was another 20 min wait...thank God the baby was on her best behavior. I hesitated on writing this review but then thought..it started out with a very rude hostess which I definitely should have mentioned to the manger..she didn't even greet us as we left..but she sure did the for the couple behind us. Not quite sure I will give this place another try :(",

My fish, though, were amazing; very possibly the best ive ever had. after some dealing with it, the waitress saw my mom and our friend were unhappy, so we had them remake it. then, thinking very accurately, she asked if we wanted my plate hot-held so we could eat at the same time. our friend often thinks of such, and it is one of his pet peeves; so she then was brilliant at that. when we got our food, we were all extremely happy; they decided to remake my food as well to halp make things as best as possible. my mom and our friend both loved their salmon, and (even though I didn't think it was possible) my second plate was even better! there was so much flavor in my fish I felt like one piece was 2 or 3. when we finished eating we still had lots of food to take home, and then they brought out Croissants! those themselves were so good that even though we [thought] we were full, we ate every last bite.  all in all, the experience was very good, and the food was delicious. and for the price? its definitely worth it. you could easily spend around the same amount at Denny's, Chili's and other such American food restaurants.",

I explained I had called ahead to the host. She handed me a buzzer and said nothing i can do. We only waited 20 minutes for a table. Not on patio. No explanation. Still nice big table inside but not what our party of 8 expected. Steak ordered medium was very well. Two loaded baked potatoes were loaded with butter and nothing else. One salad came with no dressing.one salad never came.   Getting water refills extra napkins and our near $100.00 check at the end wasn't timely at all. Then overcharged and had to be corrected.   In the days past the managers would stroll and ask the guests how things were. When Cheddars Chandler opened the restaurant things were good.  In part due to the managers asking if you needed anything. I think this created seperation from other like restaurants. It also helped servers with guest gap attention at the tables. I said  hello to the manager when we were leaving. He was busy, told him everything was fine. It wasnt a time for a conversation. We go to this restaurant once or twice a month. We will go back as I am counting on a better experience.  I still recommend cheddars. Fact is we like the place. Just not our night.",

We waited 35 minutes for our cocktails only to be told \"the bar was behind\"! Then we waited an additional 30 minutes for our food. When our food arrived we were missing half of our sides. The waitress came over after us sitting there not eating and said \"is something wrong\"? We said we didn't get our mashed potatoes for either plate or our salad. She said \"oh I subbed the potatoes for the salad they must have messed up in the kitchen\". First of all a server should never blame the kitchen and we never asked to sub the sides. She never apologized and the management didn't seem to care either. A man we are assuming was the manager walked by several times and never said a word. We were not the only ones upset either. The table next to us didn't get their drinks until AFTER their food!  On another note the food was decent.",

Came here with family friends and ordered the steak and shrimp and specified that I wanted the steak medium to medium well. Steak came back overdone. Travis the waiter, Who was wonderful,  apologized and offered me a salad while I waited and the rest of my party ate. The second steak came out and Travis waited until I cut into it to make sure it was right and sure enough it was completely well done. He apologized again and said he would have the manager come over. By this time my party had finished eating. The manager came over and apologized again. He informed me that the kitchen manager was back in the kitchen and would be personally cooking my steak. Even though I didn't want to have my party wait I really wanted the steak more than ever now of course since numerous steaks had come to the table and been taken away. Finally the THIRD steak came out and I was so glad and I cut into it and could not believe it was completely well done. This time I thought maybe they don't have pink steaks and I'll just taste it. Dry and over done. I just could not believe it. So Travis comped the meal, apologized profusely and we paid the remainder of the bill. Left disappointed and  hungry.",

    "text": "Based on other previous reviews, my dad and I skipped a dinner here 2 weeks ago (my dad is very particular when it comes to service). I figured 2 weeks was long enough to get things situated and it was time to give it a shot. We were not disappointed!  To sum things up for readers: Out of all the different items ordered, only 1 was a regret. The service was prompt, friendly, helpful and didn't miss a step. Because it was only one side dish that didn't make the grade, I decided it wouldn't be fair to knock it down a star just for that.  So my experience still deserves a 5 star and will look forward to a repeat visit in the future.   Read on if you are one for details:  We arrived at just after 4pm on a Thursday and were seated immediately.  Within 2 minutes our server Blake was there to ask about our drink order. We always go for iced tea but my dad needs to have a spoon for stirring (lack of spoon puts you on the never again list) and extra lemon. After another 5 minutes,Blake had teas, lemons and the ever important spoon delivered for thirst quenching to commence.   He asked if we had a chance to think about appetizers and though we hadn't, my dad asked him what he would order. He hands down told us their hand battered onion rings. So began our Cheddar's food adventure.   The onion rings are amazing but the portion is huge for 2 people. For entrees, I ordered the steak and chicken tender (as these were also highly recommened by our awesome server) combo with green beans, baked potato and mushrooms. My dad chose the Ribeye meal with mushrooms, green beans and mac n cheese.   Blake didnt miss a step when it came to drink refills. He had it there before even asked and he even remembered the extra lemons in my dad's.   As to entree taste: I give it an 85%. Of course everyone has different tastes but here is the breakdown for me.  1) Steak- both were cooked as requested. Not overpowered by seasoning.   2) Chicken tenders - I see why they brag about these. The batter had a great flavor that was very crispy and yet not greasy. The chicken itself was cooked perfect to retain all its juiciness!  3) Mushrooms - not a flavor I am used to as at home I am a simple butter and extra dash of salt gal but they were good and thankfully not overcooked.   4) Baked Potato- Yes you can screw up a potato but thankfully this wasn't one of the times. Only I wish bacon wasn't an extra charge :(  5) Green Beans - I am more of a salty gal rather than sweet so it was odd to have sweetened green beans. No idea with what (my dad thought maybe brown sugar?) but those I had to use the salt shaker on.   6) Mac n Cheese - This was the one side dish we felt was seriously lacking. Being I make my own from scratch I figured its gotta be at least half as good. NOPE... my comment on this to my dad \"I think I would have been better off with mac n cheese from KFC across the way\". YUP... that sad.   If you braved your way through this, hope you have a delicious experience too. :)",

I honestly haven't ever seen cheese-steak prepared as this (was) with diced mushrooms, onions, and peppers with see through paper thin \"snips\" of beef.  Skip it, the coleslaw, and black beans.  On the other hand, two ordered the ribs and I assure you not even a sliver of meat remained!  Baked potato, french fries, and broccoli cheddar casserole - all very good.  Word to the wise...\"fan out\" when ordering to improve your chances of success.",

I work about 1.5 miles away, and was hoping to add Cheddars to our lunch rotation, but due to slow service (we went early at 11:15 to ensure we could be seated immediately, which we were) our lunch ended up being 75 minutes, and our waiter seemed new and did not share our sense of urgency, after we expressed it twice. Chuck, the manager, did come by our table twice to make sure we were ok, and apologized profusely that we were delayed. Just wish we could go back, but I don't think that's an option.   Btw- the chicken tenders come in a quantity of SIX with two sides. Plenty to split with a friend. For $10. And they are delish!",

It's kind of hard to ruin chicken fingers and fries any where you go! They're great at Red Robin. Cheddars is way over priced for three people. Had to wait quite awhile since it was Saturday afternoon. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again. There are better restaurants in Chandler.",

Our waitress seemed like she hated her job and acted like we were bothering her by just Being there. It took 30 minutes for her to get out order. She did not refill our drinks at all, we had to ask another waiter got refills as she was nowhere to be found. Food was good when it arrived but it took about 20 minutes after we finished our food to even get our bill. No check up or anything from her, we probably saw her 3 times the entire time and the only time she smiled was when she handed us the check. One of the worst customer service experience I have had and it makes me not want to go back there at all.",

To my surprise it was busy but not packed, the food here was great but I have to give the Sirloin steak about a 2 only because of the flavor, it was cooked well and the presentation was good for a chain restaurant. I mentioned something about the Steak to the waitress (Paula), which she was sweet and quiet charming. The manager was quick to come come and offer his forgiveness for the steak and offer up a replacement but you know me, I am not that picky. I only wanted to finish eating because I was starving. I gave  his place 3 stars because it is a franchise chair, (not Ruth Chris), and the flavor of the steak. Don't get me wrong everything but that was great the buttered corn IS the best in the business, so good in fact it made up for the steak...yes that good. I would recommend this place I will return myself, it has a nice atmosphere and outdoor seating and if you know about AZ in the spring time the weather here is epic right now, so some wine or a beer in the outdoor patio might be the way to go if that's your thing. Well till next time my fellow Yelpers!! Bon Apatite...",

    "text": "Came back to Cheddar's a couple of nights ago because I was still craving those ribs that I didn't get to try on the first visit. We arrived at the restaurant at 6:45pm. I had called ahead and asked about the wait time for 2 and I was informed that the wait was about 35 minutes. We were okay with that. When we got to the restaurant the wait had increased to 45 minutes which was whatever, I understand that they are busy and they are the new kid on the block. Right away we after sitting in the waiting area we witnessed a rather unpleasant scene unfold. A very unhappy gentleman was at the hostess stand yelling that he had been waiting for 2 hours. Now this is rather ridiculous and if he and his party had been waiting that long, they should have approached the stand earlier or just left, there is no need to wait that long to be seated in a restaurant, I guarantee the food here is not worth a 2 hour wait. They GM came over to the stand and told the man that they would get him seated immediately. He did follow the GM to the table but he was clearly very angry. After that, we witnessed about 3 other guests come up to the stand and say they had been waiting well over 45 minutes. They were all seated right away. The manager came back to the hostess stand and yelled at all of the girls (3 of them) working on the seating chart. It was very unprofessional and he should have done this at a different time in a different setting. Clearly, all they needed at that point was help. Poor management. This whole seating debacle seemed to set everything back and we didn't end up being seated until 7:45pm.   Once seated we were greeted quickly by our waitress. She was nice and got us water right away. Unfortunately after she got us water, we only saw her about once every 15-20 minutes. First my fiance ordered a starter salad. We received this about 20 minutes after being seated. We usually share the salad so we asked for an additional plate, never got it. It had hardly any ranch on it so we asked for an extra side of ranch, we never got it. We ordered our entrees when our salad came out, I ordered the ribs with mac and cheese and cole slaw, my fiance ordered the chicken fingers 50/50 with half buffalo and half original and fries. It took another 30 minutes for the food to arrive. We saw many other tables around us, who had been seated after us receive their food before we did. I do have to say that the ribs were good, not the best I have ever had but they were tasty. The mac and cheese was really good. The problem was with my fiance's meal. First of all, the half buffalo, half original was a joke. I thought based on pictures that had been posted that the buffalo strips came out similar to a buffalo wing. Wrong. Instead they just shook some buffalo sauce over the top of the strips which coated parts of all of the chicken strips making them all buffalo, not 50/50. It also made them extremely soggy and the breading just fell apart, not very appetizing. When the chicken strips came out he had asked for barbecue sauce right away. We waited and waited and never saw our waitress. No barbecue sauce to be found. Sometimes you really need a sauce to be able to eat a meal, this was one of those cases. My fiance never received his sauce and was very unhappy about the entire meal. Service was horrible. It was non existent really. I can only imagine that based on the way that the GM was talking to the hostess staff that it also carried over to the wait staff which in turn, I'm sure makes for a very stressful environment especially for new staff. It was 9:15pm when we left the restaurant.  Overall my assessment is that Cheddar's has a long way to go to become a smooth running restaurant. They need to work out some kinks in both customer service and the kitchen in order to improve the experience for their guests. They just simply don't know how to handle how busy the restaurant currently is and this is not making a good impression for a new restaurant. It will be a long time before I visit Cheddar's again. The food is pretty good but not worth an hour wait and poor customer service.",

This location is prime, just on the other side of the 101 to Chandler Mall. Restaurant is extremely clean and looks amazing. You would think from the inside this is a fancy restaurant until you read the prices and think \"YES, good food that's actually affordable!\" Since this is a new restaurant, expect to wait unless of course you come at like 9:30PM on a weeknight. Service was friendly and efficient, even though it was busy when we came. We ordered an appetizer of chips and queso (adding meat is FREE). Delicious! I ordered the Chicken Caesar  pasta salad, which has been my go-to dish at Cheddar's ever since I've known about it. I think my favorite part of the meal is the unbelievably soft and buttery croissant that comes with the meal. I could eat an entire tray of those things. In fact, during this visit, I had 3 and they only charged me for 2. We didn't get dessert- too full honestly. My boyfriend had a few drinks as well and walked out of there for $40.   Great value, food and service. I will keep coming back!!!",

    "text": "Cheddar is better but not here.  I was invited to join in on a birthday celebration dinner so I went. I checked out the menu before hand just to see the options I had.  Nothing wet my whistle but to be polite I went.  Just as I expected,  lousy tasteless bland American food. But, wait, the place was packed and hungry people waiting to get in. I'm puzzled ?  The service we had was as bad as the food I ordered. Our salads were to be served before our meal and it didn't happen.  But our server had a good excuse she said \" boy are we busy\"  My beer battered fish and chips were luke warm and the fries were cold and dry. I only choose that menu item because nothing else appealed to me.  I could go on and on but I don't want to waste my time just like the people that prepared my food.  Cheddar needs to get better, but not for me..yuck !",

We ordered the tortilla soup, bourbon glazed pork chop (came with mashed potatoes, fried onion rings, mac and cheese), and an appetizer that had chicken tenders, cheese bits, and loaded potato skins.  I finished my pork chop plate and almost licked the mac and cheese dish.  Yup, it was that good.  The appetizer plate was too large to finish so my companion took it home.  I tasted everything and it was delicious, especially the seasoning on chicken tenders. (what is the world did they put in that batter?!)   Our server was Karissa. She was super attentive, and told us a little about the restaurant since it was our first time here.  At the end, the manager came by and gave us warm chocolate chip cookies.  Amazing.  Everything was delicious and I will be back real soon.  Feel like going back right now and I only left there a few hours ago.  LOL",

I only got one refill on my drink today, and it stayed empty the entire second half of my meal. My food came out about 5 minutes after the rest of my party. Those things aside... It is one of my favorite places to eat. The meat loaf is the best you'll ever have. I suggest you start off with some chips and queso, and do yourself a favor and add the free seasoned beef to the queso. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "This review consists of a tale of two meals!   The first time my wife and I had been here was for lunch. We sat in the bar area and our server was excellent! She was thorough in explaining the restaurant's concept and menu items. She was attentive but not invasive. The food was excellent and we had a very pleasant meal.   Based on that experience, we decided to go back for a dinner meal around Valentine's Day. When we entered the restaurant, a lady without a uniform didn't even look up at us and only asked how many in our party. She handed two menus to a young man who did an average job of seating and exchanging pleasantries with us. The server was extremely poor, in fact, one of the worst of any restaurant we have been in for sometime! Whether it was asking us if we were ready to order directly after we'd been seated, to the lack of attention to cleaning appetizer plates and never filling drinks unless we caught her attention, she just appeared to dislike her job intensely.   With that being said, I filled out the customer survey from the check and asked someone to contact me, as I believe that a place cannot improve without the knowledge of how some of their employees are coming across. The manager did call me a few days later and I shared what had happened and he said that he appreciated the constructive feedback. I just wanted him to be aware of what we encountered both times we had eaten there so he knew the positives and negatives.",

Came here for dinner on a Friday but the wait line was out the door so we decided to come back another time (make reservations for dinner) came back for lunch on a Sunday and it was moderately busy, there was a wait line out the door as we left around 12:30pm so this place is popular.   The floor was a buzz with servers all over the place, looked very well staffed and all tables were tended to from what I could see. Our server Amy was a delight and kept our drinks topped off without being intrusive or upsetting the dining experience. Thumbs up to her!   Menu is large with a decent selection of just about every type of 'American' foods. Steaks, pastas, chicken, wraps, sandwiches, burgers, appetizers. Large non alcoholic and alcoholic drink menu.   Check this place out, I'll be back :)",

Such a bummer coming here and getting crappy service.  We ordered a appetizer their version of cheese bites, they are ok nothing like culvers. I got the Chicken fried steak which was so yummy. It's a pretty big piece I couldn't finish ,and my dinner date got the 8oz steak and Chicken fingers. Pretty good size , food is great and the price is right.

Our entree's were: Monte Cristo which was delicious but with a bit too much breading out balancing the inside, the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, a little salty but good, the grilled salmon was excellent, fried fish and shrimp was devoured in minutes and Lastly, the 14oz sirloin was so good, ordered medium rare and as I was cutting pieces of it they were disappearing into other plates, I had too many roaming forks stealing pieces of a great steak, tender, juicy, flavorful and this evenings winner for us.    Our waitress, Jordan, provided satisfactory service to start then it became better service as she appeared to loosen up from her earlier kinda robotic first impression. Overall, I'll be back again from SoCal in my visits to my Dad. Thank You.",

This is a Texas chain which claims that all food is prepared fresh and seems to focus on the American standard menu. The decor is stone and dark wood with booths, tables and chairs, and a very nice bar area. There are also some tables outside. Everything looked super clean.  We were seated immediately and our server was prompt and attentive. I had the $6.49 lunch special and selected the Monte Cristo sandwich with a raspberry sauce for dipping and loaded baked potato. The sandwich was wrapped in a golden fried batter with powdered sugar on top. The batter was reminiscent of doughnut dough. I though this was odd at first but the more I ate of it the better I liked it.  My friend had a strawberry lemonade ($2.99) and the veggie platter ($7.99). The servings sizes were more than enough for lunch (I took home half my sandwich). The food was tasty.   I highly recommend this restaurant and plan on returning to try the Bourbon salmon! I also would like to try the broccoli casserole.",

And apparently cooking from scratch means not using heat because my key west chicken and shrimp consisted of 4 ice cold shrimpy shrimp on the smallest chicken breast known to man. They had to have trimmed meat off of said chicken breast to get it so small unless it was actually squab. The aforementioned broccoli casserole was in the shape of a scooper in a side dish. The sauce on the chicken and shrimp was tasty and was mixed with canned pineapple and some diced tomorrow to make \"pineapple pico de gallo\". My husband got the sirloin and shrimp. I am not sure what weight it was supposed to be, but it was smaller than my chicken breast.  And it was medium well rather than medium. He did enjoy the fried shrimp which were much larger than their cold cousins on my plate. The drink menu looked interesting, but I wouldn't recommend eating.",

However, I'm giving another 4 stars because our server Christopher was awesome and our food was good as well. C ordered the fried shrimp dinner $10.79. According to him the shrimp was very tasty. Since he ate everything on the plate, I'll take his word for it. The rest of us ordered the full racks of ribs $15.49 ea. This is the rib bargain of the century. I have it almost every time we're here & they are very good ribs. I would add however, that if you like your ribs wet, ask for extra bbq sauce either on the ribs or on the side as they do skimp a bit on the sauce. I got my ribs with the Steamed Fresh Broccoli and Southern Green Beans. They were both just fine. Again I ordered the Sangria Swirl & yet again it was not swirled. This time it was all just mixed in. For $3.99 it still is a BARGAIN! And that is the regular price, not a happy hour price. K & I just paid $9 ea for a frozen Margarita at Tia Rosa and although it was a fine Marg, seriously! This is a 3 star place, but the prices and servers like Christopher bump it up a notch. Four Stars.",

We decided to be seated outside since it was a shorter wait. In my opinion event the outside seating was great because they have misters EVERYWHERE! And living in Arizona that is greatly appreciated. The desserts are very cheap for what they give you. We got a hot fudge sundae cake and a monster cookie. They were both HUGE and delicious!",

We got there about 5:20 or so and were seated immediately but the place was pretty much packed.  10 minutes later and then half of Chandler showed up.  Not sure what the wait times were but it looked to be at least a half an hour based on the number of people.  Service was ok.  They just opened in April so I expect they're still working out bugs but overall no complaints.

    "text": "It was at around 6pm on a Saturday and the three of us wanted dinner and after driving past it several times we decided to give Cheddar's a try.  The wait was 15 mins max.  I decided to try the frozen strawberry margarita which was not the greatest.  We also ordered the fried mozerella bites with marinara and the kid got chicken strips with mac and cheese.  Must have been good cause she ate all but 1of the 3 chicken strips.  For dinner we got the fish & chips and chicken pot pie.  Decent and sufficiently delicious as well as affordale.  Reminded me of a nicer looking Black Eyed Pea restaurant which have all closed here in AZ.  All in all a nice experience.  We will definitely be returning to try more of the menu.",

    "text": "I have been to Cheddar's in Texas a few times. I have been here twice  since this location has opened.   I figured I should go here twice before I review.  In the first experience was the first day. We got seated pretty quickly,  they had a lot of help from trainers and such.  We got the queso w/ beef. Pretty good. The lemon chicken I ordered  wasn't really lemony. But it tasted good so no worries. The only problem with the first experience was the waiter almost forgot to pick up my card to run it. Overall that experience was a 4.  Today, I went with my mom to relive our Texan days.  Sadly this experience was not so hot. The buzzers didn't work and they had to yell our name to get our table. Our waitress was horrendous. She kept up selling ( I understand that is part of the job), but when we both said, I we don't drink we do not want a painkiller.  But she also asked 3 times if we wanted appetizers when we stated we did not want them. It took a good half hour to get our food, without getting a refill. We saw the other waiters who were doing a great job keeping their  tables happy. When we did see her we asked for our check. No asking if we wanted a desert or if we wanted a box...  She came pretty quick back with a check.  That experience was a 2. I understand they are newly open,and that explains the buzzer things. But no refills and getting drinks quickly especially in Arizona is a big part. I am just glad they opened in March and not in June.   Overall  Food- 4 (my mom didn't like her Texas toast moist from the food). Service- 3 ( From what I watched most of the waiters were on their tables pretty even, just not mine).  Atmosphere- 5 Clean and nice.   I would also say, we had waiters pretty close to our tables all the times having conversations with each others the entire time. It was kind of off putting to know about their life when maybe someone might of wanted something?",

I saw other tables around me getting service and saw the manager greeting other tables, but still I didn't get service. I was sitting right next to the POS and probably saw 6 different waiters, but none checked on me. I finally became tired of waiting and left. They really need to invest in service. I went next door to Outback and had my beer within 3 minutes and the appetizer within 5 minutes.",

My husband had the 8 oz sirloin, medium...it was cooked perfectly. I had the lemon pepper chicken, which was also cooked to perfection (I hate paying for dry chicken at a restaurant!). Both of our sides (mashed potatoes, broccoli cheddar casserole, and steamed broccoli) were nothing mind blowing, but still tasty. I couldn't resist the strawberry swirl margarita at only $3.99, it was massive and delicious. The interior is nice and warm. Overall a great first impression, especially when we received the bill! This place is an awesome value.",

I don't know why this place only has 3 1/2 stars. Staff is always friendly. Some appetizers come out within minutes of ordering them and always taste delicious. All the chicken dishes came out perfect and not dry. Every side dish is delicious and flavorful. I just had the ribs and was surprised how well they came out (better than Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse) meat falls off the bone and is not dry one bit. I recommend this place to everyone and have gotten nothing but good reviews back from friends that have eaten here. This ace never disappoints. Kudos to you cheddar's a for being such a well priced restaurant with amazing food. Thank you for all the great meals!",

    "text": "5 stars for my latest visit. From what I was expecting to what I got exceeded my expectations, so that could be a big part of my 5 star review. Complainers tend to complain so I try and look past someone giving a bad rating cause their drink didn't get refilled in time. Things like that will happen occasionally, fortunately though for me it didn't haha. I had a freaking blast and couldn't believe that I LOVVeED EVERYTHING I tried, delicious melt in your mouth honey butter croissants,  amazingly crispy hot from the frier onion rings (in amazing dipping sauces one with kick one without)  chips & creamy spinach and artichoke dip,  chilled house salad before meal with cracked pepper & ranch dressing,  then of course my entree came just in time, the grilled lemon pepper chicken on rice with 2 SIDES, (loaded baked potato, fancy Real mac & cheese)  the chicken was so flavor and cooked so well I feel like I could taste a fire wood(cedar wood maybe) grill type flavor (not sure if they use one) but it was up there in flavor and the perfect way it came apart when I sliced into it,  usually I'd expect the Mac and cheese as more of a filler but I was so surprised how good it was and the baked potato was what you would hope a good size and properly cooked one would taste like with the right amount of cheese sour cream and real butter, add a little salt and pepper to it and it was excellent. As if it couldn't get any better a surprised chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream compliments on the house for just mentioning how good everything was, there were 6 of us total and everyone had a different dish and was freaking having foodgasams and the manager just happen to stop by at the right time doing his routine check to make sure everyone is having a enjoyable meal and a pleasant experience and I guessed he liked how much we were enjoying it. Oh I almost forgot to mention i tried my wife's steak and it was so perfectly cooked and seasoned I thought it was a higher end steak and the craziest part to all of this is my meal was 8.99, my wife's 9.99 both including the 2 sides, I added the side salad for 3 bucks and the whole party of 6 split 2 appetizers well priced I remember. I also felt like the service and atmosphere and the way the waiters were trained as well as how nice they were dressed was much above what the food cost.! Maybe you won't have an epic experience like My party and I did but I'd bet you would get close if you didn't stray to far.",

First, the bad:  The restaurant has only been open for three weeks, and it showed in many ways, but my overall experience was a good one. We went on a Thursday night, and there was  25-30 minute wait to be seated. There were a few empty tables on the patio, but apparently not enough waitstaff on duty to cover them. The hostesses were a bit...immature? Our buzzer device went off to signal that our table was ready, but when we went inside, we found that another waitress had given our table to a different party. They did apologize profusely and get us another table within a few minutes. During that time, a guest came up and thrust two soaking wet menus at one of the hostesses and declared that they had spilled their drinks on them. The hostess could not seem to comprehend how to handle the matter, and told the hostess beside her that it was, \"totally disgusting!\" Which it might have been, but she could have handled it with more grace and tact while customers where within easy earshot. I think what I witnessed was mostly growing pains for a place that hasn't had time yet for the .to get a sense of rhythm and teamwork--and I think once that happens, these problems will disappear entirely  The good:  The atmosphere is fantastic. For a place that says it is a casual cafe, it has more of an upscale feel to it. Our party of six each ordered a different item, and we were all more than pleased with both the pricing and quality of the food. Our waiter Justin was friendly and personable and kept on top of refills and checked on us often enough to be efficient without being annoying. The manager came out and chatted with us at the end of our meal to check on how felt about our dining experience, and assured us that any hiccups they were currently experiencing would be smoothed out very quickly.  I would definitely go back--it seems like a good place for happy hour, too, with a separate bar area.  If you are wary because of the other reviews, I would say to wait a couple of months before giving it a try to give them a chance to work out the kinks in the service.",

However, Cheddar's was smart and had the old building torn down.  They've built a new structure, exactly how they want.  It looks great inside and out; my kids loved the large fish tank.  Being in training mode, the service was A+.  We had multiple managers stop by asking how everything was and our server was great too.  We had no issues and everyone was friendly.  I so hope they stay this way when they finally open their doors.  We tried two appetizers: chips & homemade queso and the homemade onion rings.  Five stars for both.  My picky 3 year old actually enjoyed the queso.  My wife and daughter said the onion rings were the best they've ever tried.  Not greasy at all.  I had heard good things about both and they did not disappoint.  If you like onion rings, you must try these for sure.  I tried the baby back ribs and my wife tried the philly cheesesteak.  While I absolutely loved the ribs, my wife said she'd probably skip the philly next time.  She said it wasn't bad, just not one of the better sandwiches she's had.  My ribs were much meatier than similar orders from Chili's or the Outback.  If I ever crave baby back ribs again, I'm going to Cheddar's.  I also had a baked potato (average) and buttered off-the-cob corn (decent).  My boys tried the mac and cheese, which they said was good, but would have preferred without the breadcrumb topping.  Their sides were the apple and yogurt medley, which they thought was the dessert!  My daughter likes a lot of different foods (unlike her picky brothers), so she could have had anything on the kids menu and been fine with it.   I had her try the chicken tenders (which I had also heard good things about).  They are excellent!  I'm not going to lie, I tried a bite, or two, ok maybe three!  They are hand-breaded and clearly one of the best things on the menu.  I know I will be ordering the full size entree in one of my future visits.  Her side was french fries, which were seasoned and cooked perfectly.  As for prices, take your typical Chili's or Applebee's menu and subtract a dollar or two from everything.  Not a bad deal at all.  When you add in the quality of the food (items being made in-house, etc.), there is no comparison, Cheddar's is the clear-cut winner.  I can already picture this place on a Friday or Saturday evening... good luck trying to get in.  Overall, Cheddar's has great food at good prices.  This family of five will be back for sure.",

    "text": "Have been to Cheddars in several locations, and the service is always the same....poor.  This has to be a corporate culture thing.  The staff stand around gossiping among themselves, completely oblivious to what is going on around them.  My server, who was at least trying, had no confidence, experience, and/or individual discretion for achieving customer service.  Each time I had a question he had to go ask his boss, and each time, he came back with a \"no\" answer.  No, we can't sub onion rings, even for an up-charge... Blah blah blah... My appetizer was completely forgotten, but there was no apology and no effort to make it right.  On our way out of the restaurant, four hostess girls were crowded around the hostess booth, chatting, and not one noticed us, or said thank you.  When a restaurant is so new to town, would expect to see best foot forward for at least a few months.  The food was ok, but nothing special... You can do better going elsewhere.",

Food was good, especially grilled salmon, Philly cheesesteak, chicken tenders, and fries.  Sides of  cole slaw and apple/yogurt were so-so.  Service was friendly and helpful and reasonably prompt given how busy it was.  Decor is quite nice, and food presentation was excellent.  I'd have given it four or five stars if other customers weren't so noisy it was hard to hear each other across the table. The management might consider better sound- absorbing floor coverings and wall hangings.",

    "text": "I have great memories of eating at Cheddars in Bolingbrook, IL and I was quite happy to see one in Chandler, AZ.  We have eaten there twice in the three weeks they have been open, one being the day the opened.  The first time we were there again opening night.  They weren't busy which was good.  We shared the Wisconsin Cheese Bites appetizer and they were great!  I ordered their New Orleans Pasta which sounded great on the menu.  When it arrived the noodles were very much over cooked and chicken was dry.  Since it was their first day I politely told the server to let the kitchen know they over cooked the pasta.  My meal was comped no questions asked and was given a free desert.  I was pleased with the server but the kitchen was super slow and really wasn't cooking the food well.  I know it was opening night and we decided we would give them another shot.  We did, three weeks later today.  We ordered the same appetizer and I ordered the chicken fingers and shrimp combo with broccoli cheese casserole and Mac and cheese.  I also requested my chicken fingers to be half classic and the other half BBQ.  The meal came quite quick.  However no broccoli cheese casserole and when it did come it was cold and half the portion it should have been.  They gave me mashed potatoes with gravy on the side which I did not order and my chicken fingers were not BBQ, they were buffalo.  My wife ordered chicken finger and sirloin combo with mashed potatoes and gravy and broccoli cheese casserole and opted to have half of her chicken fingers with garlic Parmesan and the other half classic.  Her ordered arrived with no gravy and honey mustard on the potatoes.  Her broccoli cheese casserole was cold and the chicken fingers were wrong.  Her steak was medium well and was ordered as medium.  The manager corrected the order but the broccoli cheese casserole came back cold again.  Third time was the charm as they finally came back steaming hot.  He comped both combos with no questions asked.  The server we had the first time recognized us and came by and said hello and he knew we were not happy.  He too was unhappy with the way things were going at the restaurant and is already looking for another place to work.  He said the kitchen was ridiculous and all the general manager has done is comped meals left and right.  I definitely caution choosing to eat at this Cheddars because they still have inexperienced cooks in the kitchen.",

We were seated immediately. Our waitress looked like she had something better to do and when I asked if I had soup and salad she said they didn't have that combo and that she didn't make the menu. Understandable. But her attitude never changed. My boyfriend ordered a BBQ burger and loved it and then we decided to order a pazookie. Huge mistake. After 30 minutes the manager came and said the pazookie was dropped on the floor and they are getting a new one. We waited another 30 mins for our new one and when it finally came we were excited to eat it. Upon diving in we moved the ice cream over and seriously found a pubic hair in our pazookie between the I've cream and cookie. Completely ruined our appetite. Because of our overall experience I will not be returning and would not recommend this place to anybody looking for an uplifting place to eat. Thumbs down.",

The appetizer came out pretty quickly. don't ever order the queso dip because it tastes Exactly like that Tostitos queso cheese dip. the spinach dip was delicious but it was cold in the middle so they had to take it to the back to reheat it but they just brought me a new one. The  chicken fingers were just like any other chicken fingers but they were fresh. then we waited 43 minutes to get two burgers and a salmon. the Burger was good but it was nothing to rave about the mac and Cheese tasted like store bought mac and cheese And the fries were good . My wife said the salmon could have been cooked at a higher temperature it was blackened . all in all the price very fair for the food it's better than denny's and probably a little bit cheaper than denny's all I know Is your going to wait and there hours on there website are wrong they close at 10 not 11 on weekdays had to find out the hard way . But its a good 3 stars. Just make sure not to order the queso and the mac and cheese.",

I had the citrus salmon and he had a chicken mushroom dinner. Overall for the price I don't have too much to complain about. The portion was perfect, my salmon was grilled perfect. No dryness whatsoever in his chicken either. Really the only negative was the baby puree which my husband said was supposed to be his mashed potatoes, and his rice was over done while mine was a bit underdone. All in all, I definitely think this place is a step up from Applebee's and would give it another try. Service was good and attentive which was appreciated since we arrived close to closing time.",

Of course we were leery after reviewing the menu online: after all, how good can the food be at those prices? Well we got our answer - GREAT! Huge portions (realistically, too huge) and everything was incredibly fresh and bright. The beer battered fish and chips was amongst the best I've had. It was so light it was almost tempura like, but I could still barely finish about 1 and a 1/2 pieces of the 4 huge pieces of fish on my plate. We easily brought home enough food for another full meal. As for the service, pretty exceptional - knowledgable about the menu and super friendly! We may have just found our new family meal place.

My wife and I have been here three times and all three have been very consistent... really good service (three different servers), HUGE portions, great prices, good place for family, quality food.   I'll say that each time we've ordered pretty basic stuff: the pot pie, a couple wraps, some chicken tenders, etc. All very good and mostly better than I expected. The pot pie was a bit bland, but quality stuff inside so it doesn't taste like a frozen box top, like many other restaurant pot pies.   An example of some awesomeness: for $8.95 you can get a \"three course\" lunch with soup, salad and entree-type item. My wife took at least 1/2 of it home and it was great later.   From what I can tell, though, they only have a couple tables to seat 8+ people... so you're going to wait if you bring a party.   I'll continue to go here (when the line isn't out the door) and bring even my pickiest friends because the menu is so varied and the quality is high.",

(basically a better version of it than Bennigans if you have ever been to one of those). The only downfall was the Alfredo was very bland, the server offered something else but since their portions are pretty large we just said it was ok and shared the other items.

    "text": "This was my second visit to Cheddars and my husband's first. I ate here 2 weeks ago with friends for lunch and they were all pleased with their food. Cheddars calls itself a \"scratch\" kitchen since everything is freshly made. I had ribs, loaded baked potato, and cole slaw and my husband had the mango miso salmon with rice & broccoli.  The ribs were slightly overcooked but tasted great and the other food exceeded our expectations. The price was very affordable $10.70 for the ribs and $9 for the salmon. We shared the apple crisp ala mode ($5)which was delicious, but too large for us to eat. Next time I think I will order their \"Painkiller cocktail.\" The wait staff were friendly and helpful and the ambience, warm and inviting. I have decided that this is our new go to restaurant.",

There was a annoying fly that kept going around our table and at times would land on our straws and it even went into my wife's margarita. The waitress was kind enough to replace the margarita. I ordered a chicken buffalo wrap and I was just not impressed with the flavor, was not spicy at all. I'll have to give it another try next time I'm around the area and try something different on their menu. For now, I'll have to give it a 2 star rating.",

That being said, their bartenders really need to learn how to make an alcoholic drink. When we first started going to Cheddars, the drinks were perfect--and we frequented all the time, but the last few months the drinks have been awful. Specifically their soda mixed alcoholic beverages--you're supposed to add a SPLASH of coke, not fill the whole thing up with it.... It has nothing to do with the alcohol content-which is lacking, but it has to do with the taste of the drinks...they're either too overpowering with sweet and sour mix or with too much soda...  We know the drinks are cheap, but that doesn't mean the quality of them should suffer.",

    "text": "My review of 4 stars is based on just the food being a little salty but overall fantastic comfort food and great atmosphere. It also helped that our server,  Matt, was one of the best we've had in awhile.   When first walking in, they have a classy brick look and huge fish aquarium.... Honestly didn't expect it so nice inside for the prices (nicer than an Outback's or Applebee's).  The Wisconsin Cheese Bites was our appetizer and they were delicious!  Even though these are salty, that's how cheese curds should be and the batter on them were fantastic.    My wife got the New Orleans Alfredo pasta dish which had great flavor and a mixture of shrimp, dark meat chicken (in case you only like white meat) and sausage.  Had peppers and carmalized onions which really made the dish.   I got the crispy fish and shrimp.   My fault for getting fried appetizer and entree but the plate was good.  The white fish (catfish) was not as seasoned as the shrimp but still very light (perfect for the batter).  The coleslaw was actually really good which makes sense since the ribs are popular here.   Before I get to the dessert ...  I have to reiterate that our server Matt was awesome.  You can tell he's a fan of his job and the food which is always encouraging.   He helped us decide on entrees and the number one thing is he had refills brought out every time we were almost done with our current one.   Top notch service there!   The dessert we got was their Monster cookie Sundae.  Pazookie as we like to call it.   Best one we've ever had...  The cookie makes or breaks these and it was a HUGE fluffy chocolate chip cookie that was amazing! Highly recommended!   Overall...  For the price,  we will definitely be back to try their potpie and bbq ribs.   Give it a shot if you haven't yet!",

We also ordered the margaritas, strawberry and the Maui...well MAAAAAHALO! So damn, Ono (delicious)! Then came the Redfish, salmon, chicken fried chicken and chicken tenders.

    "text": "Jen found this place by searching the area using Yelp. We have been trying to try new places and we totally scored with this pick.   Jen saw they had fried cheese curds which they call Cheddar Bites on the menu and knows I love them. We ordered those and some hand breaded o-rings for apps. $5 for the rings and it was a huge pile the size of my head. The bites were breaded in a crispy Panko like breading and were frickin awesome. Also, they have the good ranch and not the sour cheap stuff.   Jen ordered New Orelans Pasta and I ordered the hand breaded chicken strips. The breading was flaky and not too thick; just right. The chicken strips were about an inch thick in diameter, juicy, and tender. They were great. Jen's bowl of pasta was enough to feed at least two people. It had shrimp, chicken, and sausage. Jen said it was just ok. I thought the chicken was a little overcooked as it was dry and tough. We both agreed it could have used a little more spice and flavor.   All of that plus our drinks and our bill was only $42.20. We had leftover equal to the amount we ate; at least. It was a really really good deal for all that we ordered.   The server Matthew was spot on and we never had to wait long for a refill or extra side of sauce. The booths were big and roomy and the decor was very nice and warming. The menu had a really wide variety from pasta and salads to steak and seafood. Definitely something for everyone and very good prices. We will definitely be back.",

The decor has such a sleek modern feel with a few strokes of country in there. I really want to love it but the food is so sub par. The service is good... but they try to be great which just comes off a little rushed. I have come when it isn't very crowded at around 3 pm on weekdays so they shouldn't be in such a hurry. They are quite friendly overall and refill drinks often. The first time I ordered the lemon pepper fish and it was well cooked as the texture was flaky and soft but it is far too salty. I had a similar experience with their sweet heat chicken and their Monte cristo sandwich as well as their sausage pasta. Everything is oversalted. I keep coming because it is close to the job and they seem to have quality ingredients but they just need to cut the salt. Their one redeeming menu item so far is the chicken strip basket. Those chicken strips are tender and crisp and the meat is moist. It is well breaded but I still do prefer real chicken skin over breading. Overall I would like this place so much more if the food was less salted",

It was new to us and a quick look at the menu seemed like it had a nice variety.  Something which scared us at first, there were tons of people standing outside and just inside their door way.  So we immediately thought there would be a long wait.  We figured it was a post-church rush, given it was a Sunday.  We waded through the mass and made it to the hostess stand.  We asked the wait time for two, and she said, \"Oh, there isn't one.\"    AWESOME!    \"But just wait over there and someone will seat you.\"  :/  Huh?  What happened to no wait??  About 5 minutes later, we sat down at a nice sized booth and given some menus.  We had time to run through it and figure out what we wanted to eat and drink.  So, we waited.  And waited some more.  And then thought, \"Its been 5 minutes, and not even waters have been delivered... Should we just leave??\"   Just then, our waitress popped over.  We placed our orders and chatted about our shopping plans.  During the discussion, we unraveled our neatly wrapped silverware, to find the fork and knife were both dirty with dried up food :(    Our food showed up relatively quick.  Not fast, not slow.  We got a club sandwich with coleslaw and some salmon with broccoli and rice.  Both meals looked good and tasted good.  Though, the coleslaw wasn't much for a side.  Literally two good sized bites and it's done.    All in all... it wasn't a bad experience.  But we weren't wow'd by it either.  We may give it another shot....",

    "text": "I've eaten at Cheddar's in CO about 10 times, it was always a 5 or 4 at the worst.  So...  Craving their chicken fried steak for about a year, I decided to make to 24 mile drive to this Cheddar's in Chandler.  I arrived shortly after they opened - about 11:20 am.  That may have been part of the issue - they were busy getting ready for the day.  I ordered the CFS, mashed potatoes, and green beans.  I'd never had their green beans before, and they reminded me of what came out of a Del Monte can back when I was a kid.  Not good, in other words.  I've always had and enjoyed the broccoli in previous visits.  The main event - the CFS....  well...  it was rubbery.  Nothing like I'd experienced at Cheddar's before.  Definitely not up to their normal standards that I've experienced over the past 7 years.  The bartender/waitress was busy, but she saved the day when she asked me if I wanted an iced tea for the road.  That was an unexpected nice touch.  I'll make the trip south to give the place a chance to redeem itself in the future - when they are on their game there isn't a comparable Chicken Fried Steak.  I know how it is when a place just opens for the day, next time I'll arrive a little later in the day.",

Everything from the appetizer to the entree was really salty for me. I ordered the chicken fried steak. The steak was tough. Is it supposed to be that hard to eat? I'm not sure if my expectations were wrong. There was also way too much batter on the steak. Sauce was salty, our onion rings appetizer was salty, and my chicken tortilla soup was salty as well. Three strikes, you're out, Cheddar's.  I never expect much out of a chain restaurant, but Cheddar's was just really disappointing on this particular visit.",

And as for the food, both meals were outstanding.  When we come to the valley Cheddars is one of our first choices to have lunch at.  The bathrooms were well maintained and the eating area was very very clean.   We live in Casa Grande and wish very much if Cheddars would build down here.

Some of the food is made from scratch, so there's a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it. Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive.  She actually waited before coming back and asking how our food was.  At most other places, servers come back right after they bring you the food, and you don't even have two bites in, so I appreciated her waiting for us to get a chance to taste it.   The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice. Visable location from the street. Inside, the furniture is dark but the lighting makes up for it.  Where we sat, near the patio, we got a lot of natural lighting as well. Our waitress only did one thing wrong, which was giving my aunt the bill instead of my Nana, like she had asked (it was my aunt's birthday and Nana wanted to pay w/o my aunt seeing the amount).  But other than that, everything was perfect.",

    "text": "Why did the Yelper swipe left on Cheddar's?  It was just no Gouda.  Hubby and I sometimes have a difficult time agreeing on a place to eat. He likes hearty, old-fashioned meals (mostly meat and potatoes),and I am somewhat of a promiscuous eater. Unlike my hubby, I like to explore healthy, foodie, and veggie-filled dishes. Needless to say, Cheddars wasn't my idea of an amazing meal, but we found ourselves there anyways, in spite of my wanton dining desires.  It's a nice facility - there are stone hedges throughout, big booth seating, a huge decorative fan, and a wall with an aquarium. The ambiance was  cozy, although the lighting was a bit too low for my liking. I found myself asking, what nasty little things are they trying to hide??? Since I had already committed, I decided to let that nagging thought go and order-in. Our server was attentive but I wasn't in the mood for any conversation, so we ordered quickly.  Our meals were mediocre at best. I had lemon chicken, rice, mashed potatoes, and broccoli-cheese bake. My meat was just dry, and well, it didn't bring out the best in me. In fact, I got a little gassy after eating my meal. Hubby had a steak, salad, and baked potato. He liked the salad and baked potato, but said his steak was tough and asked for A1 sauce (he never uses A1 unless he thinks it's lacking in flavor or juiciness).  Neither one of us felt any sparks, it was just meh. We were hungry; they fed us. After realizing we didn't have much of anything in common with Cheddar's, we both decided to swipe left.",

We requested outdoor seating as it was a nice evening.  Our wait time was understandably 45 minutes given there were prom  and birthday parties going on.  When we were called the manager took us to an indoor table.  I asked if there were any available outdoor tables and he and another manager said no.  A third man checked and walked us outside where I counted about 8 empty tables.     The food has always been so good and great sizable portions but not so much last night.   We ordered medium ribeye steaks and both were well overdone and dry.   My husbands shrimp was over cooked and dry.    The loaded baked potato was nothing more than a baked potato with a little butter and sour cream.   Carrots were undercooked.   My husband asked two servers for bbq sauce when they had a minute but it never came.  Most servers were busy with 10+ tables so didn't have time to check on the smaller tables.  Very disappointed.  Sorry Cheddar's but that's our last visit.",

Weekends are super busy but they don't do reservations, so first come first serve. If you want though my husband and I go on weekday nights when it's not nearly as crowded, and our servers can spend more time at our table. Although we've never had a bad server busy or not.   The food we have tried so far is an extensive list. All of it good. I personally think the cheese curds are a must, croissants are worth ordering right when you sit down, and you get a coupon for their queso if you sign up for emails! My husband adores the onion rings and for like $6 you get enough to feed 4 people easily.   As for meals, anything seafood I get and love. Husband has thoroughly enjoyed the ribs and honey Dijon chicken. But if you don't get full off of appetizers and meals alone, the dessert will leave you rolling out the door. Chocolate cake is gigantic in size and flavor. Highly recommend.   Overall, restaurant has always been clean and food has come out quickly. It's not your 5-star gourmet super fancy dinner joint, although the food is always perfect for the price and servers will be accommodating. My family and I will continue to come here and enjoy Cheddar's when we can!",

I had the half rack of ribs with grilled shrimp combo with the broccoli casserole as previously mentioned and mashed potatoes as sides. I have no complaints. Though I ordered to go, I did stay and enjoyed the house Long Island iced tea (I am a Long Island enthusiast). For $7 this was a great addition to my meal. I am visiting from out of town on a work trip and am thankful yelp reviews lead me here. I may come back later this week!",

We had a really good lunch there which was second only to the awesome service we received. The food tastes unique and down home style, I was surprised to find out it's a chain it was that good. Oh well, so what! It's good so we'll be seeking it out again. The food didn't take long to arrive at our table and our server was on it making sure our drinks were refilled constantly. I adored their mac n cheese. Adored. That alone will bring me back. The menu is extensive beyond belief with a ton of different types of food offerings, so it will be fun to keep trying new things. Thanks, Cheddar's, because of your server we will definitely be back!",

I'm a huge aquarium fan so getting a seat right in front of the fish tank just made our date night that much better. The prices are awesome for how much food you get. My girlfriend and I ordered the chicken tender platter. They were out of the Honey Hot unfortunately but the Buffalo was still pretty . The ranch there is top tier also, reminds you of Wing Stop ranch and everyone knows that's the best ranch around lol. I ordered the corn as a side instead of the coleslaw that came with the meal. Only thing I had a problem with for the food, is the corn seems like it may be out a can? Not a huge deal due to the pricing but was a bit strange. Our waitress was really nice. Only odd thing, is when we received the bill she became a little touchy and touched my shoulder. Made my girlfriend and I a little uncomfortable. Other than that, definitely recommend this place. We'll be coming back soon so I can't try the Honey Hot tenders!",

Against my better judgement, I still placed the order. The in-store service from the bartender was passive aggressive. Got home and the croissant had honey mustard splurged all over it, it was gross.

I've been here many times and I always order the same thing... the Bourbon glazed salmon is to die for. It comes with rice and two sides of your choice. I typically get a side of fries and Mac and cheese. For some reason, my Mac and cheese ALWAYS comes warm and not hot... like it's been sitting in a warmer or something and not made fresh? And same goes for my fries, they never seem to be fresh every time I order them.   Also, they didn't have much dessert options to choose from. They only have two options if I remember correctly.   I had to minus .5 stars because of that. But all in all, the food is delicious and the staff are always friendly.   P.S. order the Honey Butter Croissants!!! Trust me on this one.",

They told us 15 minutes, but suggested the bar for faster service. We sat at the bar. The bartender was amazing!! She was efficient, yet we didn't feel rushed at all. Everyone loved what they ordered. I had the steak with broccoli casserole (OMG!!! So good), and others had salmon, shrimp, grilled cheese, and another of us had steak. I will say that next time I will order the steak medium as mine was too dry and chewy at medium-well, but the flavor was really good! We were checked on multiple times, and the bartender continued to be friendly and efficient. I will definitely be coming back here...great service, amazing food!",

I wanted broccoli cheese casserole as my side, but they were also out of that.  When the food arrived it was lukewarm.  The macaroni & cheese was cold and tasteless.  My shrimp and steak were lukewarm  I think our food had been sitting there for awhile.  Our waitress replaced the macaroni & cheese, but it was still just lukewarm.

    "text": "The decor here is extremely nice, up to date and super clean and as said by many others I had high expectations for the food. I agree the quality is no different than if you were to go to chilis or Applebee's. Nothing to rave about. I was disappointed.  Our waitress was super nice, it was about 4pm on a Monday so seating was immediate. I was disappointed that there were a group of employees sitting at a table across the way chit chatting in a large group I'm guessing due to the lack of customers at that time of day but it gave an unprofessional feel.  I ordered the Cajun pasta, again nothing to rave about, and I didn't much care for the sauce. The garlic bread was ok but tasted like the same ones I get from the store, Texas garlic toast in the freezer section. And they charged extra when I asked for an extra piece of toast, which I found silly due to the pricing.  My husband ordered the steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli, the steak was decent, I liked it better than my pasta and the sides were bland.  I expected more. We will try it again I'm sure in hopes of better food.",

Easily enough for 2-3 servings. Mashed potatoes were decent, cheese curds were tasty with a unique panko type coating. Broccoli cheese casserole was exceedingly cheesy with rice and a little broccoli. Overall, good home style food. A little heavy for our taste but I can see how others would enjoy it.",

We expected to wait for about 30 mins but was pleasantly surprised when we were seated right away. There were 3 in our party.  The service was great.  The food was perfect.  Strangely enough, despite the restaurant being packed, I could hear my husband and son talking without a struggle.   My son had the kid's meal - chicken tenders with mac and cheese - he loved it.  He finished his plate and told us he was full.  Which is amazing since he never seems to fill up.  I had the grilled salmon (blackened) at the server's recommendation.  It was perfect.  My sides were the broccoli and cheddar casserole (delicious) and potatoes (ok...I'll pick a different side next time).  My husband had the New Orleans pasta.  A hearty dish. A lot of sausage and shrimp.  Spicy though.    Meals averaged around $10 give or take a few dollars.  The kid's meals are $4.99 including drink.  I was impressed with the food and service and can't wait to go back.",

He told her we do not that. 1st off all if everything is cooked from scratch the chef should know how to saute some shrimp or maybe the waiter didn't want to deal with a complicated order. I don't know. I was very unimpressed & I'm not a harsh critic at all but It was my moms friends birthday and she was even disappointed with the service because the lack of care and concern of the waiter. He didn't wanna do anything we asked of him. Omg. But because the manager walked up and greeted us personally I will give this 2 stars and the croissants with honey butter was to die for. But the service made this a 1 star visit along with Luke warm food. Only good things about my first visit is in the picture.",

Only one problem with the visit.   Cheese curds: sadly, over cooked, when fried cheese is over cooked the cheese will come out of the breading leaving them hallow, busy night though so it's ok, it happens.   Grilled tilapia with shrimp and mango salsa: very, very good! I'm on a mango kick lately so it was very delicious. Fish was cooked just right, even the rice was good, a lot of places have gross rice that clumps up, this wasn't.    Fried chicken strips: I liked them, really crunchy  Sides: Mac and cheese: soooooo good, and I'm super picky about mac and cheese, I loved it! Highly recommend!  Broccoli: good, not too soft and not hard  Mash potatoes and gravy: really good, love their gravy  The dessert cookie: I got one to-go, haven't had it yet but looks amazing. I asked them to put the ice cream in a separate container so that the warm cookie wouldn't melt the ice cream on the drive home, they were actually nice enough to put each ingredient in a separate closed container. =)  The service: awesome service!! Didn't wait long for anything, didn't go without a refill, and the waitress was a sweetheart! The receipt says her name was Susannah.  Definitely will be back.",

We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and seated right on the spot as well (good timing on our part as they had a lobby full on our way out).  The server was very friendly and all meals came out as ordered.  I saw what I assume was the manager walking around observing the team, which is not something I'd seen previously.  The atmosphere has been well maintained.  Comfortable seating and a very nice decor.  The food itself was very good.  A great improvement and worthy of an updated review.",

You get the point, it was beautiful. I naturally expected beautiful food to go with it.  We sat at the bar and were fortunate enough to be helped by Charles who was seriously fantastic! Attentive, drinks were great, super friendly, simply wonderful service. He is probably the only reason we'd give it a second try.   I ordered the Philly cheese steak which was super salty, greasy and basically inedible. The cheese wasn't even quite melted. The coleslaw tasted like it was straight from KFC and I haven't stepped foot in a KFC for like 10 years and I still remember being sick from it.  I really, really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. Amazing service at the bar 5 stars... food 2 stars. I may go back for a drink but that's about it. And not more than one, mind you, they were really good but also very pricy!",

    "text": "All you need to know about Cheddar's is that it serves good comfort food and has a well stocked, ample bar area.    We came here on a Friday night around five. Cheddar's was in the middle of it's opening week growing pains. We were told there was a ten to fifteen minute wait, and nearly fifty-five minutes later, we were seated. LOL  As noted above, the food makes up for the confusion at the hostess station. The servers were on top of their game, and many were backing each other up, busing each other's tables. Nice!  The atmosphere was busy as you could imagine.  But, Jeff the Manager was walking around, keeping a watchful eye on things. He made a point of visiting each table and greeting guests by saying: \"welcome to your new favorite neighbor restaurant,\". It worked on us. Double, nice!!  The menu is mixture of burgers and steaks, with the prices being extraordinarily reasonable. The half pound burgers on the menu were only$6.29-6.79, with the chicken and steaks around $11-14.   We started with two ice teas, one regular, the other a Long Island.  Surprisingly they were less than $2.00 apart and came out almost immediately. Did I mention our server Lori was good?  She treated us as if we were her only table!  After the teas arrive, we decided to try the Spinach Dip (see photo) for $5.99. It was very tasty, served with light tortilla chips and warm salsa.   For our entree, we ordered a half rack of BBQ ribs ($10.79)and the Rib-Eye Philly Steak Sandwich ($8.49).  The ribs had a nice smokey taste. While the only downside was the sandwich, which seemed to have more mushrooms than steak.    As mentioned above prices are very reasonable, and yes we'll be back after the newness and crowds settled down. Expect to pay around $25 each, including one drink each, one appetizer, taxes and gratuities.   So Three and a half Stars \"A-Okay\". But this might change, since Cheddar's has the potential to become a goto neighbor restaurant.",

Probably the biggest reason we don't visit more often\" That was the comment I left months back.   This evening we had MARK for server and I purposely didn't order water for the fact that it tastes so bad and I won't even sip it. MARK looked at me weird when I said I didn't want anything to drink with the meal. A few minutes later he came back and asked if I wanted anything when the food comes out. I said no again, but added that I didn't want any water because it tasted so horrible. He smiled, looked at me and said \"no worries, I got you\" and he returned with bottles of water and a glass of ice. Absolutely fantastic service!",

Liked it so much wife bought me gift card for Father's Day. We've visited 5 times in 3 months it's 40 minutes from our house. The pain killer drink was very tasty. The decor would lead you to think it had higher entree prices but very affordable you can have great meal and leave cheaper than bill at Olive Garden or the like.  Kids meal is good daughter enjoys grill cheese and the cheddar broccoli is awesome.  Give a try won't be disappointed",

We both looked at the receipt like 'is that right'? What a deal.  The restaurant is very nicely done, love the huge fans, and our waitress Emily was great with suggestions.   We sat in the bar area where they had the games on, but with close see captioning on and the volume down which was nice as we could actually carry on a conversation. The food was cooked to perfection and boy are we stuffed!  They have a huge menu so we will have to go back to try some of their other offerings.  Two thumbs up!",

The chicken was great! The honey mustard dressing was a little strong. I would have preferred something different.   Service was friendly, but somewhat superficial. She would ask us how things were, but zoom off before we could ask for something. She never picked up our dishes, and we had to ask for a to-go container.

So everyone has been telling us to get the meatloaf because it's the best, so my bf got the meatloaf, I got the orleans pasta, and we also got the baked potato soup.  The pasta was really salty, not sure if jambalaya is supposed to be really salty because of all the seasoning but it shouldn't be to the point where I can't eat it! And the meatloaf was good but not great like what everyone says it is. However, the soup was really delicious!  I would come back, but this place wouldn't be my first choice to dine to.",

I did notice while I sat there all of the waitresses/ waiters seemed very attentive and nice. That's not seen very often these days so , kudos to team Cheddar's !  My husband had the ribs and steak with coleslaw and fries, he said it was good, but nothing he would want to go back for. Myself, again am vegetarian so it was very hard to find something.  The soups all have meat in them so although you can choose off a sides list , I really didn't want 4 sides but a real meal.  With that being said, it's not a go to for me but the service as well as the drinks are AMAZING!",

The hostess sat us down and our waitress came over right away. She was very friendly from the start! The inside was loud and it was very busy!   The menu is not too big and they have it to where it's easy to read. They have all the entrees under different categories depending on what it is you want to eat.   We ordered:   One grilled salmon on top of rice and my two sides being mashed potatoes and sweet corn  One grilled chicken with Mac and cheese and cheesy broccoli casserole   One spinach dip   My grilled salmon was delicious. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The mashed potatoes weren't good though and they tasted too much like boxed mashed potatoes. They felt like they had been cooked with too much water. Yuck. My corn was okay nothing special.   When my friend got her food we noticed that her sides were wrong. We then quickly informed our server and she kindly said she would bring out the correct ones. A few minutes later, she brought out the Mac and cheese and the broccoli casserole my friend had originally ordered and she was nice about it.   The spinach dip was AMAZING. It was hot and gooey, yummy! It also came with fresh chips and salsa on the side.   We were there about two hours or so and at the end our server brought us out some warm chocolate chip cookies to go.  They were delicious!  Prices are reasonable and the food is good. Our server was the best and she was very attentive!   They have a huge ceiling fan when you walk in which is super COOL.  OH AND WAIT THE CROISSANTS ARE TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!",

I remember how delicious and yummy they were! They used to be free and served at every table, I mean it's only 3 dollars but still. But they were absolutely amazing and I enjoyed every second of eating them! It was hard not to order another order of it. My bf and I both ordered chicken tenders with ranch and hot buffalo. They were not bad and i would order again. The prices are really not that bad at all and incredibly reasonable. You expect it would be a lot more because the restaurant is upscale.

When you walk in, past the front counter, is this giant fan that spins vertically, and it is one of the most unique interior design choices I have ever seen. The atmosphere here is great, friendly and helpful staff, and clean facilities.   Their menu offers a variety of re-imagined American food, from Dijon Chicken and Mushrooms to Blackened Salmon Salad. I ended up going with the Monte Cristo sandwich, because the thought of a ham and cheese sandwich with raspberry jam sounded like two things that shouldn't go together, but wow, Cheddar's really made the sandwich into something unique! Instead of using sandwich bread, Cheddar's used a sort of donut to hold all the pieces together. If you have a sweet tooth, I would definitely recommend this sandwich!   Really enjoyed this place, and I'm looking forward to trying some of their other unique takes on food.",

I'm not talking about stellar food but if you want to down to earth, good, and comforting food, this is a place to check out. If you read their menu, they use fresh ingredients and they cook all of their food. You might be thinking, \"Well, duh, all restaurants cook their food.\" I encourage you to read about chain restaurants and what they actually serve you. Anyways, enough ranting.   I have been here several times but most recently, I got the chicken fried steak. They asked if I wanted the lunch or dinner portion. The only difference is that you get two chicken fillets in the dinner meal. The difference was $2. I ended up ordering the dinner portion so I can could have leftovers for lunch the next day. My portion was huge! For $11, I was impressed by how much food I got. I also go the honey butter croissants. This are so good and flaky! For all the times I've been here, I've never had something that I didn't like. They offer a huge selections of options too! There is something for everybody.  They are usually packed on the weekends and you have to wait for a table but to me, it's totally worth it!",

It took over 15 mins for our table of 5 to get their drinks and the service was slow when it came to our food as well.  Despite the wait, I really enjoyed the chicken pot pie I had and side of Mac n Cheese. The drinks and food are very descent and I'd give them another shot and hopefully have better service.",

    "text": "I would love to give it a better review considering how beautiful it is inside. But there's just been too many hiccups that bring this down. I came here on Sunday at 9:50pm and were told they were closed, and infact on that particular day they closed 'earlier than usual' (which is unfortunate since the hostess that answered that phone stated 11pm is when they closed and  the hours on the website also state 11pm). It seems like there's a lack of communication on somebodies end in regards to the correct timing.   Anyways, onto the actual restaurant. Based off the decorating inside is what really carries this review to three stars. Nonetheless, I was excited to try this place that just came to Chandler. Me and my party of three came here and were welcomed by the managers promptly and told for us to enjoy our meal. We had our drink orders in and we had ordered the santa fe queso and onion rings for starters. The onion rings were rather good, but the queso was just a mess. It really tasted like the queso that I purchase from the store for my sporting events in my house. Everyone in my party ordered a variety of burgers(we're not very original). I chose the mac and cheese as a side, which I thought was also just okay. They were a bit cold, and to spend 2.49$ on a side I expected at least more than ~4 bites of mac and cheese. We waited quite a while for the burgers as well, but i'm just going to assume since this restaurant just opened that they've not used to this influx of customers on a weekday. The burger itself is very good, not the best, but for the price-- you can't beat it.  Food:  2/5 (I just wasn't impressed, honestly) Interior: 5/5 (gorgeous)",

    "text": "I have been waiting for this place to open for a while now, so as soon as I found out it was finally open I cancelled my dinner plans and came here instead.  Being opening week I know not to expect the service to be perfect so my 4 stars are only for the food. If I had to rate the service there would most definitely be less stars. These people are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. They kept bringing people things they never ordered multiple times,  and the waiter didn't even know what sodas they had. On to the food, my boyfriend ordered the half rack of ribs with the chicken tenders. The ribs were so delicious, they were juicy and the meat fell off the bone.  We got my son the grill chicken kids meal. It came with rice and we got the mac and cheese for the side. My son loved the mac and cheese, he ate the whole thing! The grill chicken was cooked perfect, which was awesome because they normally over cook it in almost every restaurant we go to.  And last, I eventually got the 50/50 tenders half original and half buffalo with mash potatoes and corn. They messed up my order at first, they only gave me buffalo tenders so instead of taking some of my buffalo tenders away and bringing me a couple of original tenders later. I had to wait 15 mins for them to make me original tenders and when they were finally done they just heated up my buffalo tenders so they didn't taste so good. You can tell they were reheated. The original tenders were good they were juicy and crispy on the outside.  Nothing special about the corn or mashpotatos though, I expected them to be better since everything is made from scratch.  I also got a salad which the waiter forgot to give us, we got it after we had gotten our meals. The salad was really cold, and I felt like I bit into ice when I ate the tomatoes.  Not nearly enough dressing either and since our waiter was Mia after the mess up,  I just didn't eat it. Overall other than my buffalo tenders, the food tasted Like the previous chaddars that I have been to in texas which is the reason why I was so excited to begin with. Hopefully when I go back everyone has been trained and the service is as good as the food.",

    "text": "When I found out they were opening a Cheddars here I got really excited b/c it's one of my favorite restaurants back home. The place was packed for it to be 5:15 in the afternoon. At first, the wait was 30-35mins, but then I went back to back if we could eat out on the patio and were seated right away. Even though the place was packed, the food came out hella quickly which was surprising. I ordered my fav, New Orleans Pasta and it tasted the same as back home...GOOD! It was my coworker's first time trying Cheddar's & she loved it. Which is saying a lot b/c she's picky as hell (She might read this & if so, Hey Girl! *waves*).   Our server Demera was nice. Her service was prompt and she was engaging. We stayed there, unexpectedly, about 4 hours, & Demera still came over asking if we needed anything & refilled our drinks. Most waitresses would be giving you the evil eye wanting you to get out after you've paid lol. I teased her asking why they raise the price of the croissants here to 3/$2.99 when back home they're 3/1.89 lol. You gotta try the croissants! (I didn't get it this time, but also try the frozen Texas Margarita)  I did order the Monster cookie for the first time and it was a bit too sweet. I probably wouldn't get that again. I'm not much of a sweets eater anyway.  All in all, Cheddar's is a great restaurant with good food and nice portion sizes at a very reasonable prices.",

    "text": "So I finally got the opportunity to get over to this place last night.  I've been dying to experience the hype and I was quickly disappointed.    When my daughter and I got there it was perfect timing. We were greeted and seated right away. But when we were leaving people were waiting for tables.    Our meal consisted of an appetizer and two entrees.  So let's start with the appetizer.  We started off with a small portion of the Texas cheese fries.  It was perfect for two.  It was more than enough actually.  You could do this for three and stretching it maybe for four.  Overall the flavor was good but it was very salty.  I could feel my hands swelling as we were still there.    Our dinner entrees.  My daughter ordered the bacon burger.  Fries are extra with the burger.  My daughter asked about the cost of the salad and our server told her she's give it to her complimentary.  I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and you get a side with that so I ordered the Mac and cheese.  Which I was told \" good choice\" at time of ordering.  So this made me very excited about my choice.     Let's start with the bacon burger.  Appearances are very deceiving and plating is a big miss.  It was a half pound burger on a plate.  All by its lonesome.  So that just looked odd.  My daughter picks up her burger and takes her first bite and quickly spits out what she just bit off.  I asked what was wrong and she takes the top of the bun off and in the finely shredded lettuce she had to hunt for the pickles.  When she found them, and if she liked pickles, she would have pickle with every bite and the bacon.  She loves her bacon and had to take it out because it wasn't quit cooked all the way.  Needless to say she could only eat half of it and left the rest behind.    Now for my buffalo chicken wrap and Mac and cheese.  It was two tortillas cut in half with a side of ranch dressing for dipping.  Here appearances were not deceiving.  I could tell by the tortilla that I would not be happy and again plating is a miss.  I took my first bite and wondered where the buffalo sauce was.  It was very bland from that standpoint.  I couldn't taste buffalo sauce at all.  Disappointing.  Then just like my daughter I begin to taste pickle.  I unroll the wrap and I too would have had pickle with every bite.  I didn't even eat half of my meal.  Then I decided to move on to my side.  Another disappointment.  The cheese was very bland and watered down.    Service.  Our waitress was very nice but we didn't have a check in or asked at all how our meal was.  I finally got a refill on my tea after the bill came.  Our total bill came to $28.00 and it probably would have been better off going to a drive through and saved half and gotten a better meal.    This restaurant falls into the category of new American and gastropub.  New American yes, I could see that.  Gastropub I'm still questioning.  I've been to a great, high end gastropub in Los Angeles and I can't even compare the two.  I think they missed that mark.  I think you can tell by my one star rating that I won't be going back again.",

But our most recent visit was less than satisfactory. It took around 15 minutes before someone even asked for our drink. The waitress said she was about to get off but since our original waiter was so busy, she would take our table. First I thought that was really nice and then I could easily see she regretted her decision and wanted to leave lol. Our original waiter came up asking for our drink order and we explained we had already been helped. Anyways so then it took about 10 more minutes to receive our drinks, we just got waters and one soda. Then it came time to order the food. We got onions rings, chicken pot pie, chicken tenders, and spasagna with meat sauce. Never had it with meat sauce so I figured I would try something new, along with the chicken pot pie. Normally they have the best onions rings and chicken strips. After waiting 45 minutes for our food, it was not tasty at all :( the chicken pot pie I could barely eat. The chicken in it was so disgusting and unseasoned. The onions rings were literally dripping with grease and they usually don't! The spasagna itself was okay, but their meat sauce was not good at all. Plus it was still frozen on some parts. Yeah, like, biting into a tomato and meat ice pop D: so that made the spasagna cold. I always thought they made the sauces daily, not kept them frozen. The chicken strips were lacking, too, so I was so heart broken. I loved this place so much :( I'm hoping that my next visit will be much better, and I can update this review.",

Our appetizer chips and queso was delicious, and the mango tea even better!! I had the lunch combo half sandwich/wrap abd two sides. I went with the buffalo chicken wrap. The flavor was there, hoping for a tad more buffalo sauce, abd the bedding in the chicken was somewhat soggy and falling off but over all the flavor was good. For sides I tried the tortilla soup not the best I've had. The loaded baked potato side was most definitely loaded. It was my favorite part of the dish. My husband had the chicken tenders and steak other than the soggy onion strings his meal was delish! Over all good experience.",

    "text": "This restaurant goes into my list of scary restaurants.   The waitress was friendly and the food came out in a timely manner.   I ordered a Cheddar Club sandwich.  In seeing that the turkey was processed, I removed most of the turkey and ate one of the four sections.  When I started to take of the turkey in the next section I noticed something strange in it.  Every slice of cheese still had the paper on it.  In looking at all three sections left, every piece of cheese had the paper on it.  Yikes, I already ate one section.    We found a manager and explained the issue. He whisked my plate up and said he would take it off the bill and ask if I wanted something else.  Before I could answer, he was gone.  No apology and certainly no concern for me.  It felt like an expected problem.   The waitress came buy and flung the bill on the table and was suddenly very rude. Something was really weird at that point.    I emailed the company the next day.  They never responded.  Makes me wonder what else they are hiding from.",

    "text": "Cheddar's is OKAY. I'm glad to have finally tried this place from the wonder of the occasional drive-by. Is it a cheese place?! Not really. It is your classic American restaurant. But I didn't leave with a super happy and satisfied stomach. I came with a party of about 20 and was initially told it would take about 1.5 hours to seat us but they managed to accommodate us on their patio seating within 30 minutes. Kudos to them! It was greatly appreciated. However, the menu wasn't very exciting. I had a hard time choosing what to order and not because everything sounded really good but because nothing really stood out to me. You have your typical appetizers, salads, pastas, and dinners categorized by protein. I went with the grilled chicken alfredo pasta with vegetables and it was alright. Not too flavorful. I had to hold back from adding salt. My boyfriend went with the ribeye steak with broccoli and mac & cheese which I tried and it wasn't bad at all. The mac & cheese was my favorite, nice and creamy. I tried the Cajun pasta as well and it had the flavor I was looking far. For dessert I had the giant cookie and it was giant, served on like a huge spoon! It was a little over-baked for my taste, I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked. I had the pleasure of trying their croissant bread pudding though and it was excellent. All in all I have mixed feelings about this place. Would I come back here? Probably not. But it was a pleasant experience with friends. Staff was attentive and food came out in a reasonable amount of time considering our large party. Some bad choices on my part but I would like that what I think sounds good to be great. Does that make sense?",

    "text": "We went to this restaurant for a team lunch from work. Several people on our team had meeting and were going to be late. The hostess did not want to seat those of us who were there and so we ask her to seat us at a table for two where tables could be added as our group expanded. She was going to put us in a booth, that was clearly not going to work for the expansion. So we asked to be seated outside. The manager came over after we were seated and explained to us that they were not prepared to have customers outside and to be patient. (As he was saying this the staff was preparing for another group on the patio.) The manager also said that we should not have been seated before our group had fully arrived, implying that the putting together of the tables was an inconvenience to him and his team. The manager went on to say more comments compounding the feeling of being uncomfortable and unwelcomed. I will never go to your restaurant again, personally or professionally and will explain this situation to everyone I hear planning a meal at your business. If this is the kind of person promoted into management through your business, your business is one that I choose to not support. Furthermore, he was short and sarcastic with a waitress who was bring out the food orders and asking who had what, he told her the chicken obviously goes to the only person left without food in front of them. It was sickening his treatment of people.   On a good note. Our waiter, Mike, who was very pleasant, helped to salvage some of the pleasantness of our Friday team lunches.",

The burgers DO NOT come with fries, be aware of that.  My GRILLED fish taco turned out to be FRIED FISH STICKS and under cooked.

Along with the Wisconsin cheese bites (addictive) and chips and queso (good).   Our server warned us that their portions were large here and we did notice a few to-go bags leaving while we were waiting, so we kept that in mind when ordering our main dish. Between our family we tried the baby back ribs (ok), chicken tenders (ok), Sweet Heat Chicken & Shrimp (a joke), Top Sirloin Steak (so rubbery it was painful to eat), and the smokehouse burger (good but regular size).  We noticed that in no way did any of the portions seem \"large\" in comparison to any other restaurants I've been to, so not sure why that was emphasized by our waiter.  All-in-all, this is typical chain-style American food. The drink I had was good, the meal I had was forgetable. The value wasn't there either. We all agreed we wouldn't return.",

My party of five had such a hard time we actually spoke to the GM who was there that night.  The manager was absolutely rude to the point our waiter apologized for his behavior.  Other then I think the waiter wants his position he came back to our table to talk with us about the managers response to two of my party disliking their food and brought over the GM. For the waiter to notice the managers behavior should tell you something.  So the story, our wait time was 15 minutes less then we were quoted.  We ordered our food, the fun part!  We had a chicken tender meal, two chicken fried steaks and two Cajun pasta's. The pasta's came cold and they were sent back. We were under the impression the we're making fresh food but it came back so quickly it obviously was the same. The noodles were over cooked.  This is when the manager came by and asked if it was better. They said yes because it was hot. Then after two bites they couldn't eat it because it was mush. The manager came back then got rude because they had originally said it was good. They were referring to the temperature. He actually argued with my party and basically called them liars.  Okay, chicken strips I was told were chicken strips. My chicken fried steak was actually okay but nothing to write home about so don't get okay confused with a craving.  Needless to say both pastas are now off the bill and they have lost their appetites. They were offered dessert and we were given our bill.  Bill paid and still waiting for dessert. After 15+ minutes I told the people next to us they could have our dessert and we left.  Hope they get there groove on but I'm not so sure I will be back.",

The atmosphere was nice and clean. My daughter was fascinated with the fish tank which was right by our table. The reason I give it a 4 stars ( really 4.5) is because of the cheese bites being a little salty and the toughness of my hubby's ribeye. We will be back though!",

When we contacted the restaurant by phone, we were blown off and only told they would talk to the kitchen. Four of us sent emails to them with no response back. We had very good service from the wait staff, but the customer service we have received after the incident has been horrible. To not be acknowledged or given a response was bad customer service. An apology is all we were looking for. Our family will never eat there again and we won't be referring anyone either.",

    "text": "Wow is this place poppin! We arrived and the place was packed. There was a 5 to 10 minute wait, and we were super hungry. We sat down in 5 minutes! I didn't want to come here when the place opened and thought I'd give them some time to work out the new business kinks. I'm glad I did, cause looking at all the bad reviews and good ones had me very curious about this place. But anyway the service was really awesome, the girl asked all the right questions and took down our whole order... The only thing was she sold herself short a little bit by not following through with all the awesome questions she had... For instance my wife ordered the chicken Alfredo, she said it came with veggies and my wife said she would like them on the side. well, we never got them at all. The other thing is she asked if we wanted our salads before our food, and said yes! Definitely.... And of course our food came out with our salad, equaling our food to be cold after we ate our salad. Food was not hot! Probably the biggest complaint. It was slightly warm though, and atleast it was good... I warned the staff but I didn't want them to take my food. Was only trying to inform them. The garlic bread served with our food was only 1 little piece, and really soggy with butter, barely toasted, no crunch to it at all! I asked for more bread, and she brought me 1 more slice of sogginess.....oh well, me and my wife are extremely picky, and like lots of bread to go with our New Orleans pasta and chicken Alfredo. Honestly we really liked the food even though the little things didn't add up very nicely. We will come back! They are always super slammed so I could tell the waitress was overwhelmed and the kitchen staff wasn't working with her to really make the customers extremely happy. You can tell this place is going to have a lot of criticism, but I recommend trying it out and see if it's for you, maybe give it another month for things to slow down a little bit, but ultimately the food is good, service is good, decor is nice.... Place is loud, but what do you expect from a new business thats just jam packed with curious Arizonans.",

Cheddars wishes it was : Fridays or Chili's   Cheddars tries to look like (interior design and ambiance) and will never be in 1bil years Kate Mantelini. If u don't  know what Kate Mantelini is, then you just don't know how far American comfort food has come since 1981  Verbose (Longer) review: With a copper sign and a name like cheddars  was expecting a lot more, especially when entering cheddars and experiencing the ambiance and interior design., the rotating fans were impressive  as well as the fish tank.  When we all got the menu, we instantly were transported back to 1989 Chili's or Cocos, jaws dropped, all three of us struggled to comprehend the pairing of food to the motif and name of the restaurant.    One of us attempted to order something \"cheddar-y\", the Texas fries. Opinion:  tastes like bacon potato wedges from Jack in the Box, although Jack in the box  has softer cheese, making it a bit better.  I ordered the chicken Alfredo: opinion, go to Frys, Ralph's, albertsons or your local market and buy a buitoni frozen pasta, save $4, it's the same thing.  Rosemary Chicken sandwich: way too much mayo, bun was rosemary bread, chicken was blackened to cover up the rubbery texture, meal was not even %50 eaten  In fact all our meals including, the best of the bunch, the chx pot pie, we're only %50 eaten. Not worth the time or sodium  To top it off the appetizer and entrees came out at the same time and the side salads came out 5 min later, wtf?  Never going back",

The first time, I thought it was somehow by mistake, but then it happened a second time and now I will NEVER go back! Oh and the last time we went not only did they give me raw chicken strips, my aunt also ordered chicken and instead they gave her fish. Get it right people!!",

If you're looking for dessert, try the apple crisp... however. You'll need to share it. It's large!",

Onion rings, best ever.  For myself, I ordered steak. There are four offerings: a sirloin and a ribeye. I ordered the 6 oz sirloin cause I thought that was enough for me, $9.99 with two sides. Now the grilling gave it a nice flavor, but it was like chewing an old rope. I have not worked harder to eat something this half-year; I have a boot I think I could eat quicker. Again, good flavor, just not very edible. I fault myself for being attracted by the price; I should know better. My advice to you, if you order steak here; spend a little more, take the ribeye; avoid the sirloin.",

We were sat down promptly but it took forever for the waiter to finally come to our table. It wasn't crowded we evan asked the hostess if we could get service after sitting there fir some time she said and pointed to our waiter that was him  Instead of asking if she could get us something just water.When our server finally came over we ordered. We ordered the 8oz salmon abd didn't look like 8oz. We were so hungry we ate got our bill and left! It was a very disappointing experience.

I went here for the first time last night expecting a decent night out with my girlfriend, and I was just disappointed. We were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes, we waited 45. Once we were seated our waiter got my drink order wrong twice. I eventually just left it alone and had a water. We ordered the chips and queso for an appetizer and mediocre is about the best adjective I'd have for it. The queso had a film over the top of it like it had been sitting for awhile. Although the salsa was actually pretty good. My girlfriend ordered the steak and chicken tenders, and she said it was average at best. Her mashed potatoes had a giant clump of potato in the middle of it, almost like they didn't mash half a potato.  I had ordered the lemon pepper chicken, and I have to say it was the worst dish I've ever received in a restaurant. I have NEVER sent a dish back before, but I had to. The chicken was rubbery and bland, the rice was undercooked and had zero seasoning. The best part of it was the green beans. I guess if I had any sort of recommendation from this place it would be the green beans. I would expect this sort of experience from a place like Boston market or something, but for me to go out to dinner and spend $50, I'm expecting something better than this.  If you're thinking of coming here for something new, don't bother. Awful food, mediocre service.",

Baked potato - cold so butter didn't melt.  Corn very tasty.  Meal was cheap but I was missing a salad and bread.  Next time I'll substitute a salad for corn.

    "text": "I want to like this restaurant. The 3rd time my BF and I visited was this afternoon. We received a coupon for chicken fingers in the mail so we thought we would try again. Since I think it will take too long to explain the 3 visits we've made I'll summarize the pros and cons below:  Pros:  * Great breading on chicken strips * Good drinks * Fresh food  * Fish was cooked well  Cons: * Literally had portion of a butter stick wrapper in my corn on one visit * My BF witnessed a waiter drop knife on floor then pick up and put back on someone's plate (today 6/11/17) * Timeliness is questionable (sometimes we had service when we wanted, other times we've had to wait to grab someone walking by) * Inconsistency in food quality. Really loved onion rings once, but ordered fries with my meal and found them soggy and old. Seemed unusual since this was during the same visit. * Staff seems plentiful yet no one appears to want to work there. No one has been particularly cheerful or knowledgeable in my 3 visits.   The bartender told us today that it had been very busy and everyone was there to redeem the chicken fingers coupons. She mentioned that the marketing clearly had worked but she was pointing out how they were unprepared to handle the onslaught of customers.   We witnessed several employees hanging out at the side bar picking up drinks etc, but it seemed slightly unprofessional to see a presumed cook staring at the bartender's butt while waiting for his personal order to come up. Also, to see so many employees standing around, presumably waiting for drink orders. I know there were tables to be cleared and waters to be freshened.  I am not a F&B professional, but I do know that something is going wrong here and it appears to be staff. If I ask what to order between 2 dishes, I appreciate more than just a, \"well, they're both good\"-type answer.   Maybe the issue is with management but clearly the staff is lacking. Their numbers are great but their skills are limited.   I want to like this place. Please tell me why I should ever try again.",

    "text": "First time at this restaurant. Came to try the salmon lunch and have a drink after work. Was seated but a lovely host and everything started great. About 10 mins of just sitting there no waiter had even stop by the table to check on us. About another 7 mins passes and finally a waiter came and ask if we had been help and we said no then he took or drink order and food order. We ordered the Maui Margarita. Which was a blended drink with mango and strawberry puree with a kiwi sauce on top and a green shot on the side. The waiter came back 20 mind later with no drink stating the bar ran out of strawberry puree. So we informed him that we want the same drink just without the strawberry. Waiter came back about 12 mins later with a completely different drink. There was no shot on the side no green kiwi sauce on top it was just a complete different drink then what we ordered. I tried to explain that we wanted the same drink just with out the strawberry puree and he keep telling us they don't have the drink we ordered. Then I tried to explain to him do you not have the drink or did you guys just run out of the strawberry puree. Then again he states just the puree. So then I said OK well we want the same drink we order just minus the strawberry puree. He didn't understand because his answer was we don't have the drink. So I asked to speak with he manager. The manager took his sweet time coming to the table mean while our food came out. Nice and hot a fresh but took then forever to get the food out to us.  Manager finally showed up and I explain the situation to him and he had a dumb founded look on his face as if we were wrong and the waiter was right. He stated the waiter rung in a mango Margarita and that's the drink we have in front of us. Then I explained again that we didn't order a mango Margarita that we order a Maui Margarita with all the extras. After auguring with him for about 6 mins he finally left and  made us the correct drinks but he had a look on his face as if he didn't want to.Needless to say they finally got the drink right but my experience with the waiter and the manager left a bad taste in my mouth and I will never return back to this restaurant or tell my friend and family to go. There waiter and management need some serious training in customer service.Instead of the Manager just try to correct the issue he want to argue with me. Neither the waiter or manager apologized for the situation.",

My family still loved it, but I only found it just OK.  My daughter and I had the Monte Cristo sandwich.  The insides of the sandwich was good, but the fried dough outer shell was a bit greasy and not very good tasting.  My daughter still loves it.  My wife enjoyed her bacon burger, mostly because the bacon was really thick, especially in these days where most bacon in burgers and sandwiches are so thin that you can read through it.  My other daughter go the Philly Cheese Steak.  She ordered it w/o mushrooms and it came with mushrooms.  They quickly changed it which surprised me.  We had their famous Skillet Cookie Sunday was just OK.  The chocolate chip cookie was very bland and the there was not much flavor to the hot fudge sauce.",

Very good, and not over oily.. nice flavors.  1/2 Rack Ribs ... great flavor, and a little overcooked, but that worked out so you can uses a fork n eat without getting overly messy.  Grilled Shrimp - had an off taste, definitely over cooked as well, but was edible.  Broccoli Cheese Casserole was actually VERY good, could almost eat that as a main dish..   Not quite what we expected, but will be back periodically.,  ** bartender wasn't too attentive, we usually sit at the bar to get better service,",

It was a doughnut sandwich worthy of the most deep fried of state fairs. Had it been served at a fair on a stick, it would have been an amusing oddity. Our surly waiter clearly hated his job and stomped around morosely, so we didn't dare say anything about it. My advice based on what we were served at out table: if you are going to brag about \"cooking from scratch,\" you should at least make sure your cooks can actually cook. And the aggression level of both our waiter and the manager was high-middling to just plain high.  Based upon how we were treated, the waiter and manager made it very clear in a number of ways that they would probably be happy if we never again darken any Cheddar's door. Since I can't imagine any circumstance which would cause us to return to any Cheddar's at any location, it worked out for us all in the end.",

Amazing. We both ordered the grilled tilapia/shrimp entree. The entree came with wild rice and 2 sides...I chose broccoli and Mac & cheese. The broccoli was a little mushy, however it was steamed and bright green. Everything exceeded my expectations. So good, my friend ordered another entree to take home to her hubby spur of the moment.

Once we were seated, it took a while for our server to come get our drink order. We ordered the nachos as an appetizer, which took about 15 to 20 minutes to arrive. They were not great but edible. My husband ordered the Monte Cristo and  I ordered the fish and chips with mac n cheese. Shortly after ordering, our server informed us they were out of the Monte Cristo. It was a bit confusing because it's made with basic ingredients right? If it's made from scratch, what could they possibly be out of? He ordered the country fried steak instead. Our meals came and they were good, but nothing that I couldn't live without. Our server seemed less than thrilled to be at work and did the bare minimum to take care of us. I am not the type of person that wants to be waited on hand and foot, but she didn't refill my drink once or take away our appetizer dishes before our food came out. I was so disappointed with our experience today because I've heard so many great things and wanted to really love it. I'm not sure if I will return in the future. Maybe to try the Monte Cristo, if it's available!",

And we love going to local places, so dont be fooled this is a chain. A small chain but still a chain throughout the USA.  We ordered a lot of food and the portion sizes are huge. So if you are into that - big plus.  Most memorable part of the meal - cheese curds and mac and cheese side. 4 stars for the atmosphere and service.",

I flagged the waitress down and let her know about the problem. Knowing that this is a great place, I thought it would be taken care of. I received my plate back from the manager. Instead of a \"sorry this isn't up to your standards, and we will fix it,\" I received a \"this is why you are wrong\". Not good customer service at all. I ate it because at that point if the manager won't help, then you are just out of luck. Mistakes happen, I get that. When you are called out on it, fix the mistake.

I usually ask for two of them because they are just that good. My normal entree is a small sirloin and chicken fingers plate with two sides. The Mac and cheese is really really good as a side and I usually pair it with fries. My sirloin a has been cooked a perfect medium rare each time I've gotten it.  On to the negative: Out of the times I've been here, twice I've been skipped by servers. Tons of servers walk passed us and didn't stop by at all. Two times I've sat in the booth with no one coming to greet us for 10~ minutes so we've gotten up and left and gone somewhere else. Tonight we are going to outback next door.  Even getting bad food at a restaurant, service can always make up for it but when there is no service and the food is good, you lose any of my business. It's a bummer because we enjoy cheddars.

Service was decent, he was very friendly. The hostess did bump into the food runner and knocked some of our onion rings onto the floor. The poor guy kept apologizing profusely, however we only lost about 3-4 of them and we didn't really care. Good value for the food!",

I often order from a lunch specials menu for price and portion size, plus those dishes often come out faster.  Service was good.  Our server was sufficiently attentive but not overbearing.  Food came out a little slowly.  Menu looked like a pretty typical \"casual dining\" place.  The food itself was good.  Was it anything really special?  No.  But it was good.  I had key lime chicken.  It was a tad dry, but with the pineapple pico that wasn't a problem.  My wife had the Cajun pasta.  It also was good.  The same sort of food you'd find at Chili's, Applebees, TGIFridays (are they still around?), and that sort of thing.  The interior/decor was a little more relaxed than most of those, however.  Not a lot of clutter or TVs, just a big aquarium.  I wouldn't make a point of going here, but I wouldn't avoid it either.  It was good, but not compelling.",

Although, there was an expected wait as it was prime dinner time, but we did not mind. Our server was great; friendly, courteous, and welcoming. The onion rings we ordered were delicious, at first I wished there was additional seasoning in the breading. Later eating them as leftovers, they were delicious just the way they are made. The hand crafted teas were both delicious, free refills, and did not taste syrupy or too sweet; they were more so on the refreshing side, some of the best flavored teas I've had. The shrimp with the cocktail sauce, delicious with and without. The chicken tenders, usually tossed in an optional sauce of honey hot or buffalo, I ordered the honey hot on the side since I'm not usually one for hot sauces. Just in case, I also ordered additional ranch on the side. I must say, both sauces are on the top of my condiment sauce list. The only issue I really had, and the reason for the 4 stars, is because of the mac and cheese. It was more so on the thinner side of cheese sauce and I could almost taste the water the pasta was boiled in. Steak had a great simple flavor. We will definitely be back, and a thought the chicken plate may be my go to, I am always willing to explore the menu.",

Employees, Management and Corporate all acknowledge a long-standing issue with water taste and quality here.  Municipal water does NOT taste this bad; even unfiltered Chandler water.  I was told the water is filtered, but I have a difficult time believing that.  There is some serious subterranean defect that is contributing to the water issue here; I have not encountered such an aversion to water anywhere else like this before.   Yes, it is that bad that my whole review is dedicated to how me and my dining companions could not find enjoyment in our meal (in an otherwise acceptable food experience) because of the water offered for consumption.  It was so bad that we each needed to order beer and wine just to avoid the water source here.  The food served here is acceptable and is what should be expected from a chain such as Darden; average food that could and would be elevated by other experiences yet falls short.  What is not acceptable is the oversight in addressing the quality and taste of the tap water served here.  The service is typical Darden Restaurants which is to say that it is a bit heavy handed on greeters, bussers and upper management wandering about, and not heavy enough on quality food preparation, capable line cooks, proper execution of recipes or focused enough on consistent food prep in the kitchen.   Our table unanimously agreed that the food was tasty (although two steaks had to be sent back to the kitchen to be re-made) however, the experience in dealing with beverages here was NOT acceptable - nor was the solution: \"We have tea and soda.\"  \"The water in the tea is heated and does not that that bad.\"  Really?  It's still the same water in those beverages as it is in this awful water glass!  The atmosphere was trendy and appropriate given the cuisine and price.  I just couldn't help but think that the water in the fish tank displayed in the dining room would taste better that what is served - I remember looking around at other tables to see if other diners had issues with their water but all their tables seemed to knowingly be devoid of water glasses.  Maybe they were forewarned about the water.  Overall, I think that Cheddar's has a good concept and acceptable food.  I will return just to see if the water situation has been addressed, however, I am not counting on much change to something that you do not pay for.  Alas, I feel that I am clearly in the minority of water snobbiness, but consider yourself warned: BYOB.  And, by the way, Don't Drink the Water!

The steaks are AMAZING; cooked perfectly as ordered. Broccoli cheddar casserole AMAZING; medium crunchy fresh broccoli.The restaurant was very clean, bathrooms are really nice and also very clean. Very surprised with the price as well, prices are more then reasonable for the portions and quality. Will start coming more frequently!",

Brick walls, tile floors, nice booths, and a nice freshwater African cichlids aquarium behind the bar.  There are televisions placed throughout the restaurant. I was able to watch the Utah Jazz vs. Phoenix Suns game (the Jazz beat them, but I'm from Utah so that was a good thing.  :)  I ordered the queso and chips to start my meal.  The queso was good.  The chips were okay.  A few weren't crispy.  For the main course I order the 20 oz. bone-in ribeye, medium.  For my sides I chose the loaded baked potato and the mac and cheese.  The steak was good, a little over medium toward the ourside, but perfect near the bone.  The mac and cheese was excellent.  I could eat a whole bowl of the mac and cheese alone. The baked potato was cook well.  Michael my waiter was great.  Refills came fast.  He knew the menu well and was very personable.  The manager stopped by part way through my meal to make sure \"everything was okay\".  Overall a great steak and a good meal.",

    "text": "My boyfriend & I have been coming to this location for quite awhile and even after we moved 30 minutes away kept coming back because of the food and service. Sadly, after tonight we won't be making the trip anymore.  We placed an order for pick up and were told 18-22 minutes which is completely fine with it being a Sunday night, we assumed it would be a little busy and have no problem waiting. I was told on the phone when placing the order to head to the bar where Amanda would have the order. When we got to the restaurant to pick up the order, the hostesses and manager were up front. They were very nice and helpful and directed us to the bar for the to-go order. When we asked the girl behind the bar (I'm assuming Amanda, she didn't tell us her name) about the order for pick up she right away seemed annoyed that we had asked her for anything. We brushed it off, we get it, it's busy & maybe it's a long night- no worries. She asked for the name, the order was under my boyfriend's name. She looked at her orders and told him she didn't have our order on her list. So he thought maybe there was a mix up with the name since she just looked at him with a blank stare. So he told her what we ordered instead. She said, \"Nope don't have that\". Then silence....no apology, no offer to put the order in (which we would have had no problem waiting for). Just stared and rudely made him feel uncomfortable for asking about our order.  We understand sometimes mistakes happen & orders get forgotten, just let us know what's going on. Don't make your customer feel in the wrong and like they're an annoyance.   **Attached a screenshot of when we placed the order this evening.",

    "text": "I'll preface in saying this was my first time going, but it won't be my last. I went here with my wife to celebrate her birthday. The menu isn't overly complex to read and is refreshing in being a single (though large) page. I ordered the half rack of ribs and chicken strips combo, with a loaded baked potato and fries. It. Was. Awesome. I am a BBQ freak and I pretty much hate restaurant BBQ sauce - no one makes it right, except for a few specific places. Cheddar's BBQ sauce, however, is phenomenal and isn't a generic, watered down brown sugar paste. It has a mature flavor that demands attention, actually adds to the meal but can stand by itself, and doesn't make my face pucker from sweetness. It tastes the way BBQ sauce should. The ribs themselves were very good, easy to separate from the bone, and quality. As for the chicken strips/tenders: this is the first place I have ever been where chicken strips are placed as entree and they pull weight. I was very skeptical of what felt like a kid's order; I was blown away when I dug in. I'm craving them as I write this review right now.  The ranch was amazing and contributed to the taste of the meal as well. Keeping in mind that everything is made in house from scratch, I'm not sure why I would have thought it would be any less than what it was. The meal was memorable and delightfully surprising. I eat big meals; I wasn't able to finish my sides and took them home with me for later in the week. My only negative notes are that the strawberry and raspberry lemonades were not as good as lemonades I've had at Chili's or even Red Robin. The table service at Cheddars far surpassed both of those locations.",

    "text": "This is my first time ever writing a review for a restaurant and I go out to eat way more often than I should. I first found out about this place about this time last year when I went out to dinner with my aunt and her husband. Since that first visit, I have been hooked and try to go about once a month or so with my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I have even recommended this place to our friends and coworkers who have gone out and tried this place multiple times as well.   So by this point, I have tried a lot of the items off of their menu and definitely have a few favorites. By far, the honey butter croissants are the best item on the menu. I order them every single time and crave them constantly. The stacked nachos are also a favorite of my boyfriend and mine, as we have tried nachos at many, many other places and nothing quite lives up to Cheddar's. The broccoli cheese casserole is also to die for and the steaks are well-seasoned and always come out cooked exactly as I like/order. I've tried a lot of their pastas and they are not bad, but however, not as good as their other items. My boyfriend really likes their burgers and their Philly cheesesteak.   I know this review is really long, but hang in there. My boyfriend and I are both fairly young (we turned 20 this year) and since young couples are notorious for being bad tippers, we often get poor service whenever we go out to eat. However, at Cheddar's the service has always been excellent and one server in particular has started to recognize us and is always very kind and makes our dining experience memorable each and every time.   So, in short, the food is great. Certain items on the menu are better than others, so if you have one experience that isn't all that great, give them another try! The service has always been spectacular as well, regardless of who is waiting on us.",

    "text": "My husband and I eat here practically every week. We love the food,and it is consistently good. We have had excellent servers and several servers who barely know the basics (offer a refill, check on the guests, offer a box for leftovers). Please tell your servers to show a little personality and not act like they can barely slow down to bring you whatever and can hardly wait to get away from the customers. I'm not talking about extended conversations. I'm talking about the ultra minimalists who take an order, usually without a smile. Who ask if everything is ok as they keep on walking. Who usually drop the bill, without a presenter, and who seem oblivious to obvious needs like boxes and drink refills. My final comment is about the badly ripped seat in the booth I was offered. Please don't ruin this beautiful restaurant with seats that cut into people's legs.",

Sometimes the food is amazing and everything is on point and at times they take forever and the food is on the greasier or salty side. I understand that things happen, that there are off days but maybe I've just been going way too much on their bad days? I don't know. Service has always been accommodating though, specially when they have mistakes, so at least that.   Food - depends on what you get. Did not enjoy the Chicken Pot Pie but I love the Chicken Tenders and their amazing mustard sauce.   On drinks I've had their Painkiler and Texas Sweet Tea(with liquor) and both were just alright.   Meh. That's my rating. Sure I'll eat here but I probably won't be craving for it.",

The food... the BBQ chicken and ribs combo was decent but didn't impress.  Still, no big complaints about that. One member of our party had the soup and sides combo and the sides were so bland he didn't eat most of it.  When he declined a take home box, the server, who could clearly see the meal wasn't hardly touched, didn't even ask if he was dissatisfied.  They apparently can't be bothered to get a water filter because the water tastes terrible, so get a soda or something to drink.    Bottom line:  The prices were very reasonable, but the food is hit or miss and the service is less than impressive.  I don't see myself going back.",

    "text": "After many wistful nights staring longingly at their online menu and many canceled plans to pop into the restaurant, we finally got to dine at Cheddar's.  Cheddar's serves up some great American comfort food at a decent price.  The place was buzzing with activity but there were still lots of empty tables available at 6pm on a Friday night.  The three of us shared the Wisconsin Cheese Bites as an appetizer.  These were super delicious when they were hot out the fryer.  \"Melty, oozing, little clouds of cheese that's lightly battered\" would be how I describe them.  Even after they cooled down significantly, they were still a nice little treat.  Although a bit salty, I liked them.  I love cheese!  My dinner companions had ribs, chicken tenders, and some sides.  I tried a little bite of the ribs and they were right --- they were a little dry despite the nice glaze!  I was fooled.  The mac and cheese also had a weird texture.  It felt a little gritty.  Is it just me?  Anyways, I ordered the chicken pot pie for myself and it was amazing!  Crusty flaky top with big chunks of chicken with some peas, carrots, and potatoes all swimming in a creamy sauce... Oh man!  It made the Painkiller cocktail go down smoothly.  I also got a house salad with blue cheese dressing on the side with my pot pie and it was refreshing and delicious.  I only wish there were more giant chunks of blue cheese.    While I'm not entirely sold on Cheddar's and I can't say it was everything I hoped for and more, I had a lovely dinner with two of best guys in town!  Would I come back?  Probably.  I think I want to try the chicken tenders!",

I went in for my birthday dinner and waitted for 22 min for our appetizer, we didn't even get the appetizer after that time went by our waiter came up to us and said they ran out of queso for the dish so it was ok we told them to just cancel that order and we'll just have the rest. We then proceeded to wait another 25 min while tables around us got their food. It got to the point where we had to just get up and leave because we were starving. We left, as I got in the car I realized I had forgotten my wallet inside on the chair. I went in to go get it an it wasn't there but the table was clean. I asked if a wallet was turned in and they said nobody had turned in a wallet but I had been no where but that seat. I'm not one to point fingers but clearly someone picked up the wallet and decided to keep quiet about the finding. I hope no one has this same issue and that that person receives there karma",

That's not a very good reason to abandon your tables.  As for food, we ordered the spinach dip which was really good, a steak with fried shrimp, and the baked spaghetti.

The restuarant is very loud, parking can be a problem depending on the day/time.The prices are good, maybe due to smaller portions. On the receipt they figure the tip for you which seemed like a nice touch, however they figure it with the TAX! Uh, no thank you I can figure 15-20% on my own and it doesn't inclue tipping on the tax.   This is a restaurant you settle for I wouldn't go out of my way for it. I'm guessing the reason for the 4 & 5 star reviews is due to the location near the mall and the plethora of bad chains to choose from.",

This place is about an hour away from me and I drove here just for that because I know how good they usually are from the Cheddar's I would always go to back in Oklahoma. Their Monte Cristo is literally hands-down, the best fried sandwich ever. Perfectly crisp to the bite, served with raspberry preservatives (a great combination), and was well worth the drive! The side of macaroni that I had was also really good! I've been trying to branch off and try some of their other food, but I always end up running right back to their Monte Cristo. Amazeballs. Every bite is exquisite and it puts a smile on your face!  Overall experience and taste; I'm feeling a light to decent 9/10 for this place.  Ya'll know this is just my experience right?",

The menu has a ton of options, so it should have something for just about anyone. Also the prices are very good for the amount of food they give, the portions are quite big. That was the good. The server was there and made sure my water cup stayed full, but seemed a bit disengaged and brought us our check with our food, which I found kind of odd. As for the food.. two of my kids got chicken tenders but none of them ate them saying they didn't like them. My other kid got the Mac and Cheese and enjoyed it. My wife got the buffalo chicken wrap and ate most of it. I ordered the ribs and chicken tenders with a \"loaded\" potato and Mac and cheese. I took one bite of the Mac and cheese and the loaded baked potato was plain and just sour cream and cheese. The ribs seemed over cooked and were ok and the chicken tenders were plain. Overall, there are a lot worse options out there but we probably will chose elsewhere in the future.",

First it's Thursday night and they refused to push tables together so the whole party could sit together. The manager said it's again at corporate policy. Is it against corporate policy to make your customers Happy? I GUESS SO! So our group of 16 after waing 1 hr 10.min had to be separated.... one in a table and one set in a booth nearby but completely separated. Then we order. While Graylin our waiter tried his best we had a few dishes that had to be sent back one in which was never replaced(he assumed they didn't want it) Plus my steak tasted like the most fatty cartilidged top,sirloin ever, and was Dec not cooked to a medium.  I didn't send it back because we had been waiting for 2 hours for this disastrous dinner. Needless to say I'm contacting corporate and will not be back. Thank you Cheddars for making my large group of family members feel like more work then it was worth ... next time move 5 tables and let people who come together eat together .",

We've been to the Chandler location three times since. The food is excellent and the service is great every time. On our most recent visit our server Issac was attentive, helpful and polite. We love the classy atmosphere and have enjoyed each experience here. You can't beat the quality for the prices.   Today I was happy to discover that they have excellent frozen margaritas. They compare to Macayo's frozen margaritas. They are frozen in a machine rather than blended.  The Texas Frozen margarita will freeze your brain, so beware!  The good news is that there is plenty of tequila in there so you'll warm right up!  That is something about Cheddar's that I've noticed, they don't skimp on the booze.    After three visits we've had the ribs, chicken strips, sirloin steak, bbq burger and all of it was delicious! My favorite thing so far has been the ribs because the meat is tender and smoky with a smothering of sweet and smoky bbq sauce.  My favorite item menu has to be the chocolate croissant bread pudding.   We highly recommend Cheddar's!",

Transferring takeout orders to the bar phone, especially when they are busy, leaves you waiting on the phone listening to the ring tone forever, and then eventually gets you transferred back to the front desk to the hostess who (at least tonight) gets irritated that the client is frustrated that no one is answering the phone to take the order. After two rounds of this, we ordered from Rigatony's.",

This time we did have some issues and the service was slow HOWEVER, the manager ERIN and I spoke about the bathroom being unattended, the food issues, a soup brought without a spoon, and a few other issues.  ERIN the manager was almost distraught for us she felt so bad that she comped our entire meal AND gave us some coupons.  I have never had such impeccable manager interception and care.  We WILL go again if only for ERIN.  She even gave us her card to call in advance so she could supervise our event.  Thank you ERIN!",

I had the chicken fried steak and it actually had a REAL STEAK inside the yummy fried coating!  The mashed potatoes and gravy were perfect! And the corn-OMG!!  One of my sons had a bacon cheeseburger and the other had cheese fries.  Both were very happy! My husband enjoyed his steak, and they had two choices of steak sauce too!  We shared a cookie/ice cream concoction of gumminess but next time we're trying the HUGE piece of chocolate cake/ice cream!  Looking forward to going back!  BTW, very reasonably priced.  We got out of there, tip included, for $62.",

    "text": "So, today's is my daughter's 11th birthday. She's been here before with her mother and asked me to take her. I agreed because the menu looked pretty good and I was prepared to take wherever she wanted to go. It's in a building near Chandler Mall that I recall being several different restaurants over the years. The ambiance was pretty good when we arrived and it reminded me of a KEG Restaurant. We got seated pretty quickly and my kid excitedly told the waiter it was her birthday. He just kinda looked at her and then asked me if I wanted a drink. I was not excited about the lack of craft and local brews but he said they also had one SanTan brew. He also said they had other bottle types in the back. I asked if he had an IPA. He said he didn't think so & just stared at me for a good minute rather than suggesting he'd go check or anything. By now I was pretty uncomfortable and just ordered the SanTan. We got our order taken pretty quickly. She got the Salmon. I got the ribs & buffalo tenders w/ broccoli cheese casserole that I heard was good.   Food came. The tenders were moist but buffalo sauce was sparse. I had to ask for more. Ribs were fine but not falling off the bone like the waiter suggested. The broccoli casserole came in the smallest bowl I've ever seen. It was half empty and crunchy on the top. I took one bite with the spoon & it was half gone. It was also warm at best. Ugh. There wasn't even enough to send back.  So we finished our food & I snuck away to ask the waiter if they had a birthday dessert. He said they didn't so I ordered the fudge cake. I asked if they have a candle. He said they don't. I asked if they sing or anything for a kid's birthday. He acted like I was crazy. I went back to my table shaking my head. He brought out the cake a little while later (it's huge and is clearly for 5 people!!). We ate what we could and then asked for a box and our check.   I got the check and was really surprised that the dessert was charged on there. Seriously? I was disappointed, but we already ate part. Then I saw the bill, & they had suggested tips on it. 22% tip? WTF. There was no way. And then I noticed that was WITH tax. Since when does anyone tip on tax? Come on! I tipped 14% and promise to never go to this place again.",
