However both times I've gone the customer service from the employees have been terrible. The girls there are just one a terrible mood, too busy, and they're just plain rude. Please work on your customer service. I'd pick nami over this place 1,000 times. Nami is incredibly friendly and excited to serve you. So walk a couple steps over to nami for delicious food and great people. I'd rather starve than go to The Coronado and get treated like crap.",

    "text": "REALLY impressed with this place. i'll set the scene...it's a weekend and one of our reg spots, Green/Nami, is only offering brunch and is SLAMMED. we were too hungry to wait and we didn't want breakfast - it was 1 p.m. son!...as we're driving away looking for lunch, the girl says Coronado looks good. we try it.  all of the servers were attentive and on-point. the food was amazely! we tried the red bean quesadilla which was one of the best quesadillas i've ever had. we tried the chili which was a nice amount of spicy but not too much...the front person was kind enough to let us know the chili sitch, that it may be HOT. i liked the iced tea selections. i liked the crowd...not TOO full but a healthy stream of customers.  i'd imagine if more of the Green/Nami crowd knew about this place, which is like 100 feet away, Coronado would be even more busy. Coronado has a really creative menu with a lot of interesting combos (such as a red bean quesadilla). we look fwd to going back.  //we tried  the cookies, which didn't suit our tastes...the mexican chocolate cookie was too spicy and not chocolate enough; the rosemary chocolate chip was too rosemary-heavy...we might try more of the baked goods, but it would be nicer if they covered the croissants and such, instead of leaving them out in the open. there are too many transactions around that front area to leave exposed food. that's about the only complaint. the open-air set-up would just prevent us from ordering uncovered items near the register.//  prices: not high, not low. right in the middle we thought.  plenty of parking but a dirt lot - not ideal if yer car is just-washed.  overall a really cool old house funky vegan place that delivers on service and flavor. we will return. i hope the experience is consistently this enjoyable.",

The staff are white and said insensitive jokes and they knew at the get go I was not having a good time. I feel I bought something that is meant for an appetizer and prices up the wall, even for vegan food. I can tell received smaller portion of fries and worse tray than my friends who actually like this place. I think people like this place because of the stuck up atmosphere. Yet these jerks cannot take a critique and understand that I was not receiving a good service. But hey I am just this guy expressing his bad experience where I know there are people who love this place. I am all about feminism and veganism but customer service should be given, not derived from people who love this place. I have eaten places with cheaper prices, better food, vegan, and the best customer service. And the Chef was Female. If you guys want my opinion, choose to go to Green than to this self-entitled place.",

They were almost demonic. They gave me a really weird feeling and completely took away from the entire experience. I may be exaggerating but they almost made me afraid to stay in there. I wonder if they are the owners pictures or were there from the previous owners of the house. Either way I really question WHY they are there.**      *Great food, pictures made for a very bad vibe.*",

    "text": "After just landing in Phoenix, my boyfriend and I (both vegetarians) found this little place on our way to the Grand Canyon. This place is tiny but oh so cute and cozy! We ordered at the counter and then found some seats outside. This is a great spot to hang out and relax for a nice meal, a good coffee, or even just a small bite.  We ordered the black coffee chili & cornbread and the potato tacos. The tacos were decent and we devoured them pretty fast, but the chili was so cold! The chili was literally near frozen in the center. We told someone immediately, and she apologized and brought us a new one right away. Unfortunately, this one was almost just as cold. The chili really was delicious though and we were pretty hungry, and so we decided not to say anything this second time and just \"eat around the cold part.\"  To our surprise, a few moments later, the young woman that gave us the second chili presented us with a receipt refunding not just the chili but OUR ENTIRE ORDER! She also apologized to us again and thanked us for stopping by. During our visit, this place was just working out the kinks, since they were still quite new. The food itself was creative and delicious, and the customer service was impeccable!  We still ordered some coffees to go, because we just couldn't leave without spending a penny in such a friendly place!",

We both had ordered the supposedly famous jackfruit sandwich, but they were out of jackfruit so the server gave us each a free pastry to make up for not being able to order what we had wanted.  We are both vegetarian, and have dabbled in being vegan, so the menu was right up our alley. Hubby ordered the potato tacos and I got the monte vista (sp?) sandwich, and we shared the street corn. The street corn was AMAZING, but they did give our order to another couple who had ordered the same thing but arrived after us, and so we ended up eating the corn after our main meal because it arrived so late. We also both got iced horchattes (horchatta lattes) which was a nice twist.  We sat outside since it was crowded inside, but there were misters and the patio is shaded so I didn't feel hot. They allow dogs on the outdoor patio which is good to know so we can bring our dog next time. :) Overall a good experience and I'm hoping to come back and try the jackfruit sandwiches sometime soon",

    "text": "Food: I am not vegan or vegetarian (or even remotely close).I am a skeptic of any Mexican inspired food that claims to be both delicious and animal free since my compatriots love to eat even the ugliest part of an animal. Call me converted! The potato taco was DELICIOSO. I had no idea that potatoes could taste that way. Witchcraft! every single pastry I have eaten here has been perfect. they could sell this stuff in high end grocery stores and they SHOULD because this is America and our bellies demand it. Specifically - the sea salt Mexican wedding cookies & the dulce de leche filled cupcakes with meringue are delectable. I haven't eaten anything else here, so once I have I will come back and update. I usually give five stars for repeat performances.   Ambience: This restaurant is in a beautifully restored house in a historic neighborhood, so there are little nooks and crannies to explore both in and out of doors here. The decor is relaxed, clean and tasteful. Dog friendly porch included. There are theme nights with DJs and sweet music, so I am looking forward to attending one of those.  Note: I think it is important to keep expectations in order, here. The bar is small but mighty as is the staff. Good things come to those who wait, so remember you're not at McDonald's. The selections are proportional to the size of the whole operation, which is a bit on the smaller side. I say do a few things and do it well, so I am a fan of a small restaurant. Any foodie worth their salt knows that a 14-page menu is a bad sign. Though the menu is small, it is varied. It can get a bit crampy at the bar when you are ordering during high traffic times, so you might want to claim your stake at a table and take a menu with you to decide, then pop up to the bar to order when you're ready.  Edit: I am coming back to update to five stars. You can tell these owners really care about their community - locally and nationally. They team up with local vendors and have events to raise money for causes. 5 STARS!",

The cauliflower tacos, which used to be a very good reason to go there, lack the same complexity of flavor that they used to have. Prices are a bit high for what you get. $40 for two burritos and two cocktails is ok if all of the above are great. The cocktails are generally good but the food is more inconsistent. It would also help if they did not have heavy metal music blaring on the patio.",

I love goat cheese but good GOD, it is rich and you don't need that much of it unless there is something added to cut the richness of it.  It came with a TINY splash of jalapeno marmalade. Not near enough!! I expected sweet (marmalade) and hot (jalapeno) and it wasn't spicy at all, only sweet.  NO Jalapeno flavor whatsoever maybe green bell pepper? Take it off the menu or do something to cut the richness of the cheese for GOD's sake.  It was awful!!   I go to the counter and tell the girl that it wasn't what I expected and that I wanted to order a salad.  I ordered the beet salad with goat cheese and she informed me that the salad had goat cheese on it.  I told her I knew that.  I informed her that I liked goat cheese just not how they prepared it in the quesadilla.  So she charged me for the salad and it came out with a TINY sprinkle of goat cheese.  Couldn't even taste it because there was so little of it.  Go figure!  Anyway, the salad was actually fantastic even with not enough goat cheese. It would have been even better had there been cheese on it.  I would recommend it if you like beets. I paid $22.00 for basically a salad since I couldn't eat the quesadilla so not exactly happy about it but better than having nothing to eat and paying $9.00 to starve.",

    "text": "Flew in for a quick weekend trip in Pheonix/Scottsdale/Tempe are and met up with my buddy who's a local. He had heard great reviews about this place and wanted to show me because I'm a vegetarian. The place is super cute - it's basically a family home flipped into a restaurant. You order from the counter and they'll bring it to you. They have outdoor seating and also some inside but we sat outside. We ordered: 1) bottle of wine 2) goat cheese quesadillas 3) chorizo tacos 4) the beet salad. OMG THE QUESADILLAS WERE SO GOOOOOD  it was a great combo of sweet, savory, and even a little bit of spice. Wow, it just melts and oozes into your mouth with a bit of crunch. Definitely recommend!!! The chorizo tacos were kinda bland, which was disappointing because I was hoping for it to be good since I love chorizo. The salad was also okay. It was for my friend and not for me haha so I didn't enjoy it as much. I would totally come back again if I'm back in Phoenix.",

The cauliflower tacos were my fav at one time but now have continuously been served a bit greasy.  We went 2 days ago in the evening and I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  The biscuits were extremely hard.  We also ordered the rosemary cookies and they were truly hard and when we went to exchange for something else, they said it would cost us more lol - when we told them about the cookies as well as demonstrated how hard they were the staff said they had changed the recipe.  I used to love this place but definitely off of my list to never return.  Too bad - good news is New American Green is across the street and always consistent with quality and tasty vegan food.",

    "text": "The Coronado is one of the few places in town that does vegetarian/vegan food right.  They don't try to go overboard with holistic or intimidating ingredients. They don't try to make entrees that try too hard to substitute meat. They just take whole foods and turn them into ridiculously craveable plates.   The food is always delicious whether you're going for a weekend brunch, weekday happy hour, or late night meal. The cocktails are fresh and range from classic to experimental. The overall vibe is relaxed and grassroots.  So, don't fall for the assumption that vegetarian/vegan can't be satisfying; come to The Coronado and let them win you over with the palm and an order of potato tacos.",

The Cauliflower Tacos - my fave - were top notch tonight. Not sure who was in the kitchen but I can usually finish all 3 tacos and had to stop at 2 cause FOOD COMA. So good. The Nolce Dulce was creamy and deep, perfect combo beer for this meal. See you next week Coronado! We love you!",

After claiming a spot as our own, I walked back up to the bar to place our order with the bartender. She was super nice and extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu. We ordered fried guacamole, jackfruit sliders (we ordered it on sandwich bread, to make it vegan), and the burrito.    The chips that came with the guacamole were crisp and flavorful and the fries that accompanied the jackfruit sandwich and burrito were incredible. I don't usually eat fries, but these were the perfect size to enable the slightly crusted outside to contrast its soft, starchy inside. We cleaned our plates and we walked out full and happy.   We liked this place and will return again. It is awesome that their menu only contains vegetarian and vegan options. It shows that this place is definitely cognizant of compassion for animals and the environment.   Some other people's post talk about the menu being limited in choice. I actually prefer that because I tend to get the FOMO shakes. That is, the fear of missing out shakes. With a limited menu, it makes making a confident decision so much easier.",

(It rained last time I was here, too.)  I like this place - the charm of it. There is plenty of seating, both inside and out, and the interior features some really cool artwork, too. The bar is small but clean, and well-stocked for the size.  The first time I visited, my friend and I ordered food: the chili/cornbread and the potato tacos. Both dishes were very dry. We were not impressed, but we enjoyed our time here anyway.  There was also a small mishap with the coffee filters last time... I ordered a pour-over and, after nearly 30 minutes of waiting, was told that the filters kept breaking so I wouldn't be getting any hot coffee that night. Very strange. I had them bring me a tea instead.  This time, I have ordered the root beer they have on tap (a GENIUS addition to the menu, in my humble opinion). It is very tasty. I would order it again for sure.  Despite the subpar dishes (to my taste) and the unusual case of defective filters, I can't help but like this place. It has all the elements one might expect of a small neighborhood cafe.  The staff has always been super friendly, too, which counts for a lot in my book. The Coronado is a new addition to the area - I think it will do well. If you've never been, stop by for a root beer! If you want it to rain, just sit on the front porch - it's worked for me every time!  ;)",

Liam and Emily have done it again, folks!    Super cute decor, lots of little spots to sit in and outside.  They have locally roasted coffee from Xanadu (which I'm currently sipping on and loving), tasty house-made pastries (I got a vegan cherry chocolate scone...and then I got one more for the road, sooooo good!), breakfast and lunch items, beer and rootbeer on tap, house cocktails, etc.  This place has something for everyone and I cannot wait to go back and try it all!!",

I literally came in and ordered a biscuit,jam, and eggs. 15 minutes later no food.  The excuse is there was a to go order for an order of 30 tacos. Well 15 minutes prior I was the one ordering the to go. Why did the other order take priority over mine? It is always something with the wait time aside from today. Although the food is amazing, my time is precious and don't have time to wait 20 - 30 plus minutes for something as simple as a side item biscuit and jam. Once they get more help, a bigger kitchen or better location to accommodate the thriving business I'll come back.",

    "text": "I want to love this place and my first visit I did. I'm actually really sad to give this place 2 stars, because on a good day they are 5 stars, but that's the problem. Consistent quality.   My first visit, I had just an app and a cocktail, and I was blown away. It was so good! My next visit, tried those famous cauliflower tacos and was blown away- so good.  The visit I tried potato tacos. They were not great. Really dry and bland. I thought, maybe this just isn't the right thing to order. I tasted my friends chorizo and tofu tacos and they were pretty good though.  Next visit, apparently the manager went on vacation and didn't order any food. They were out of 60% of the menu. We got the fried guacomole- just unfried because they didn't have any of the crumbs. Went ahead and ordered the cauliflower tacos and the chorizo tacos, since they were out of nearly everything else. This time the cauliflower was fried too long and dark brown and soggy. Still edible, but not as delicious.  Then take another friend yesterday. We split cauliflower tacos and jackfruit sandwhich. 2 of the 3 cauliflower tacos are awesome. The 3rd has raw coating on half of the cauliflower... wet sticky brown stuff. That was not good. Then the jackfruit sandwhich. Sorry for this... Yuck. It was gross. I cook jackfruit too. To be more detailed than \"yuck\". It was bland, like no salt or seasoning. There wasn't any pop to the flavor, no salt, no acid. The texture was mainly mushy with a mild sweet undertone. It was just disgusting. I tried adding lots of salt and lime juice... anything I could put on it to make it palatable. It was just terrible. The salad that came with was good.  So, this place is hit or miss. It bums me out, because I am strictly plant based and really appreciate vegan restaurants that do more than just fake meats. The staff is always polite, the casual atmosphere is cool, but if the food is great one day disgusting the next. Well, that's not okay- that doesn't qualify for 3-4 or 5 stars. They have to get it together. I really hope they do too, because it could should and has been great.",

The only thing that would make it better is more seating. We had the fried guacamole, cauliflower tacos and chili guacamole fries. Everything was fantastic. Even my meat eating husband was raving about the food. We got some desserts before we left; a hibiscus cookie sandwich, a walnut brownie and a salted peanut butter blondie. The blondie was WAY too salty and pretty dry, the brownie was good, but the cookie was incredible! We ended up buying two more. Even if you aren't vegan or vegetarian, The Coronado won't leave you disappointed. I can't wait to go back!",

Even though the food quality is good the combinations are no better than the \"green\" vegetarian place across the street. A for the effort but a C- for the food. Here is the dilemma. Small place ok, short and to the point menu ok, but it's not well balanced nutritiously. You not eating processed soy crap but too much embellishments of non nutrient packed foods and breads, and other things. I get it and I want to support small businesses but I want well thought out quality NUTRIENT packed foods that tastes good! Trust me it possible just look at True Foods. Another thing I have noticed is the prices have went up like $2-$3 for each item...ok makes sense again but I am going to see more veggies, better ingredient like 0 canola oil you know stuff like that happen to feel like it worth it.Nevertheless give this place a try if you don't mind skipping on the nutrient here and there.... otherwise you may feel blah leaving the place.",

The menu is filled with delicious-sounding items and coffee - including a Horchatte that I really wanted to try but knew would upset my stomach (I have a hard time with sugary foods).  I ordered the goat cheese and jalapeno marmalade quesadilla and a mixed drink I can't remember the name of (it was whiskey and wine?! omg). The atmosphere here is absolutely perfect with each room feeling cozy. It's well decorated, and the staff is friendly. I couldn't stop staring at everything on the walls! Even the bathroom had awesome art. My friend had the Good Morning Sandwich, and even though they were out of both suggested bread replacements, they offered another option quickly and apologetically. Apparently their sourdough is popular!   My quesadilla was easily one of the best things I've eaten in a long time. It had just the right amount of goat cheese that perfectly paired with the jalapeno. I've been missing good spicy Mexican-inspired food, and this hit the spot. I ordered something spicy, and it was ACTUALLY spicy. I don't get that in my hometown of Pittsburgh too often! Each bite was heaven for me; I would eat this again and again if I had to. Not only was the food freaking delicious, it was also beautiful. For such simple items, they put effort into the appearance as well, which I fully appreciated.   Other menu items seemed super exciting too. I rarely go somewhere and want to try all the things because I am so picky, but their menu is perfect from top to bottom. It's pretty rare that I am this pleased with food, but Phoenix is treating my appetite quite well! I highly recommend The Coronado.   Bonus: Their hours are pretty long, 6am-10pm.",

It's a fun, modern atmosphere and the staff was very friendly, knowledgable. You pay when u order at the register. I do wish there was more walking around room though, a lot of the tables are set up to the sides and only one person at a time can walk through each room, making for a lil awkwardness. I decided to go with the Cauliflower Tacos over the veggie burger. Omg it was sooo delicious they fried the cauliflower and had a avocado, maybe like mustard mix drizzled over it with sunflower seeds. I definitely want to go back and try what else they have to offer",

The service is really spotty and I can attest to other reviewers complaints that some of the staff are not so friendly. It's also kind of inexcusable to me to serve store-bought tortillas in Phoenix. The mason jar thing has also been done to death, just use some decent glassware already. Lastly, the seating situation is frustrating and doesn't make a whole lot of sense for the space.   The picture I've submitted is the owner herself, Emily, pleading for fake positive reviews (which the owners are notorious for.) This has nothing to do with my own feelings on their personal stance on law enforcement but instead in hopes that Yelp will see this and crack down on it. It's unfair to other local restaurants that actually earn their positive reviews instead of paying for them or soliciting their friends/family to write them.",

The jalapeno jam didn't so much for me- it wasn't spicy and the jam aspect of it just made everything sticky.   The drinks: they were watered down. Are they supposed to be herbal drinks or cocktails? Either way.. not down to try them again.",

You stand at the bar which is located in a room just off the front door and order your food as well as pay for it when you order. Then you select your own table (if you are lucky enough to find an open one!) and they bring your food to you. We were fortunate as someone was leaving right when we walked outside on the patio.  The food was amazing! Seasoned so well that we did not even need to add salt! The cauliflower tacos were our favorite, although the potato tacos were a close second. You can choose regular cheese or vegan cheese sprinkled on them. The beet burger was delicious as well and I loved that it had the crunchy fried onions on it.  This is not a fancy place but to me - that was part of the charm. Even if you are a meat eater - you will still love this place!  You may just decide to eat vegan/vegetarian more often!!",

    "text": "My Wife and I came here last week for a late lunch.  You see, Junior was out of town on a school trip and my wife took the week off, so we had a \"staycation\" and were able to enjoy some restaurants we don't normally get to, The Coronado being one of them.   9 months ago, we decided to try a Vegan diet. I'll spare the details, but it's been a great choice for us.  My Brother and Sis'-in-law got us a gift card for this establishment for Christmas, and we finally made it down to try it.   For those that have not been there, The Coronado is located in a small renovated house on the N/E corner of 7th Street an Monte Vista.  Being that we went at an off time, we had no problem parking in the dirt lot on the north side of the restaurant.  I'd describe the interior as eclectic and hipster modern.  When you enter the front door, the counter/drink area is off to your left.  We were greeted by the young lady behind the counter and told that we order at the counter, and our food will be brought out to our table.    My Wife and I grabbed a table in the back room and checked out the menu.  We kept going back and forth between tacos and burgers; we decided on the latter.  We went up front to the counter and ordered our meals, the Tepary Bean Burger with fries for my wife, and the Red Potato Garbanzo Burger with salad and a side of fries (we are on staycation after all...) for me and 2 iced teas to drink.  We also selected the focaccia bread as the vegan option over the buttermilk bun.  The young lady at the counter brought us our teas (they are made fresh when you order) after a few minutes.  Another server brought out our food a couple of minutes after the teas.  Both the burgers looked hidden under the focaccia bread, but the salad and the homemade fries (long thick cut) looked great; it was at this point that I noticed my burger was slathered with mayonnaise.  I purposely selected the Red Potato and Garbanzo burger because of the 3 burgers listed on the menu, it's the only one without mayo, yet here I am looking at a thick spread of mayo (vegan or otherwise, I don't like mayo) peaking out at me from under the focaccia.    Well...as I've stated before, I don't send food back, ever; and even if I wanted to, the server was nowhere to be found.  She had dropped off our food and disappeared at almost light speed.  So...I made do with what I had and tried to enjoy my burger.  Both burgers were tasty, but crumbly which is understandable considering what they are made from.  My wife liked hers, and from what I could taste of mine, it was quite good; unfortunately the mayo not only hid the flavor of the burger, but also the agave mustard which was disappointing.  I also don't think that focaccia bread is a great choice for a vegan burger, since it's more dense and harder than the burger it's supporting; try getting some soft vegan rolls, other restaurants do it.  As I mentioned above, the french fries were home made and thick cut.  They looked wonderful and were seasoned nicely.  However, they were not cooked long enough.  They were flaccid.  A little more time in the fryer, and they would have been much better.  The catsup served on the side did have a very nice flavor.  The side salad I had with my burger was the high point of my meal, the dressing was light and very tasty.  The mixed greens were fresh and so were the tomatoes.  When we had finished our meals, yet another person showed up to take our plates.  No one checked on us while we were eating to see if we needed anything, no refills of our drinks were offered.  We left; full, but unsatisfied.    Before our visit, we had no idea of the controversy involving the owner of this restaurant, we simply had a gift card and wanted to try a new stop on our vegan journey.  My advice to the owner...spend more time in your restaurant overseeing your staff and making sure they can properly prepare, cook, and serve the food on your menu and less time trying to drive away half the population from your establishment.",

I got the Horchatte which is part horchata and part latte as well as the Huevos Rancheros. And I must say that this was the first time in WEEKS I was truly eating something I was excited to eat. The corn tortillas, vegetarian \"black coffee\" chili, fried eggs (you can choose tofu) and Oaxaca cheese with some hot sauce that they give you if you want was PHENOMENAL. I inhaled it. It's one of those place that you'd go back later to have the exact same meal. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a restaurant that makes their stomach and taste buds happy. I can't wait to eat my way through their menu.",

Even if you aren't vegan, or have ever been curious about \"where we get our protein\". It's worth stopping in. You'll enjoy an amazing meal, and great customer service!",

But customer service has never been good... possibly decent if the counter person is someone new and they haven't been indoctrinated to being a bitch. I've been here more than 30 or so times and each and every time, the counter person is always rude, arrogant, and pretentious with holier-than-thou smug look and attitude. Tonight... when I'm really hungry and not in the mood to tolerate shitty attitude, this was the straw the broke the camel's back. I mentioned I had a burger before but don't remember what it was and the counter person said it probably was the red potatoes/garbanzo but suggested the beet burger and I'm not into it. I asked if I could get crispy onions that normally would come on the beet burger to be placed on the red potatoes/garbanzo burger and the counter person said No! In an offended way and flustered while she talked down to me saying that I should have the food the way it's made because everything is paired perfectly the way it is. Ok, I wanted to walk out then and there. Ummm... if I'm paying for something, would it fucking kill you to put onions on burger for me since I like onions?! I ended up ordering the breakfast burrito instead and just wanted to have something to refuel. Seriously, what ever happened to customer service?! I hate how vegans are so damn smug. You can take your Marxist attitudes and shove it. This is another place that's gone wrong.",

    "text": "RUDE STAFF!!!  I was a frequent visitor to the coronado and would always make the 20 min drive. But after yesterday I will definitely not visit and I will stop telling all the people I know to visit. We were at the establishment for over 30 mins waiting for our food and then a food runner finally sees us and says your ticket number got confused I think your food has been sitting there I will get it. He then brings out our now room temperature food and then realizes that they never even made the kids cheese crisp. My niece was super hungry and fussy so I went to talk to a manager and as the manager is checking on it I kind of started venting to a worker that I see ALL the time and am always kind to. I tell her I'm sorry I realize it wasn't you who took the order but that I know my brother is always a good tipper it's just a little frustrating we come here all the time(we just spent over 80 dollars here) and her response in a rude tone is \"yea you should tip 20% and you come here all the time so you should know we are busy and are all human and make mistakes\" I was like woah then my brothers girlfriend came to let me know to forget about it because she could hear how she was talking to me. Then when I went to let my brother know what she said she left her spot from behind the bar to run up to our table and scold me some more in her loud rude tone that there is nothing more they can do and that they are checking on it. It was a super weird and embarrassing situation, I was always taught that the customer is always right, I wasn't screaming I was frustrated and venting to an employee that I saw all the time and maybe could understand that there was a fussy hungry 3 year old and I just got off of a plane and we drove straight there to enjoy their food, offer a cookie that they sell for 4 dollars, ask if I need a drink refill(which my prickly pear Arnold Palmer was mainly all watered down lemonade). Don't tell the customer to get over it. Not the kind of customer service I want in a business especially the amount of money and the miles it takes to get there. This was not the first time I have experienced attitude here this just takes the cake. I see a lot of reviews talking about it, maybe it's the same person and it's time to clean up shop or have a work shop class on how to treat customers. I know I would be sent home immediately if I thought I could talk to a customer like that.",

My friends and I proceeded to order food and drinks. Having spent the money (a lot of it) we waited inside for our food. A waitress with short brown hair came up to us and told us the dog was not allowed in the restaurant. We did not know this considering there were other dogs at the restaurant and the fact that the bar manager told us our dog was cute. I proceeded to ask if there was any seating outside and the waitress said no. To add, the outdoor seating was FULL. I asked if we were able to get seats outside and a table to sit at considering we just spent a good amount of money at this restaurant (to sit and eat at). We would have happily ate outside, but I would assume a restaurant would provide enough seating for paying customers. Beware, SMALL patio. The waitress refused to get us a table. She was extremely rude and made offensive comments to us. I have never had such a bad restaurant experience in my life, and I eat out daily. This waitress should be fired the way she handled the situation. I am completely shocked at the nasty unhappy attitude these staff have. No staff in the restaurant seemed to know what do to. Staff scrambling around like chickens with their head cut off. Never again will I ever spend my money or time at a negative place like this that treats their customers with no respect. NONE. This is my only time posting a review and I believe this needs to be shared.",

    "text": "I hadn't been back to The Coronado since the menu change, so I decided to drop in for a couple of things. The quaint cafe-esque atmosphere was the same and I had a reason to knock out a rosemary chocolate chip cookie. (It was staring me down, so I showed it who was boss.)  I ordered:  - $9.00 Cauliflower Tacos which are masa-battered cauliflower florets on top of guacamole, chopped spinach, pepitas, and avocado dressing  - $11.00 Red Potato and Garbanzo Burger which is a potato and garbanzo bean patty accompanied with spinach and tomato/agave mustard on a buttermilk bun.  Well...let me start by saying TC does have interesting combinations, but the food is overkill. Can't fault them there, though, because no where does the restaurant claim to serve healthy food.   My plates were tasty and comforting, but thinking of the quantities of oil consumed, it was less healthier than I prefer when eating out. I actually went home and ate a huge salad after that.  Here are my thoughts on how the dishes could be better:  I don't know why anyone would order the potato garbanzo burger with a side a fries. The patty by itself was delicious, soft, and falls apart easily. Unfortunately taste was overpowered by the thick starch-overloaded bun. The side salad I opted for was a pretty green arugula salad. It meant well, but the quantity was so small I could have easily used it as garnishment for the sandwich. Need more salad!  One thing annoyed me about the sandwich. The menu made no mention of mayo, but the cook spread mayo (vegan I presume - YUCK!) on the bun. So not only was the sandwich more oily on my tongue, it was slippery to bite into too. I wanted to slap the cook -- not for a good reason.  For anyone that doesn't like thick buns, I suggest asking if they would substitute a wrap or pita pocket. Even a lettuce wrap would be much better than that thick buttermilk thing.    As for the cauliflower tacos, once again the delivery was over done. Masa breading AND corn tortilla? Come on. The fried masa is oily and once it's cold it falls off into the guacamole (naturally oil rich). The tacos would taste much better with roasted cauliflower.   But anyway, I'm not a cook. I just eat. Three stars for the food this time around.",

Every item I've tried on the menu has been great.  The setting in an old house is so cool and unique.  The location, the vibe, the food, the crowd, it's all great.  Selfishly I hope it doesn't get too big because I love the feeling of knowing a great little spot that most mainstream ppl don't know about, but I wish them all the success they can possibly achieve.  Staff is full of hustlers that seem passionate about the place succeeding.  A++",

The Coronado is a vegetarian restaurant from the people behind Bragg's Factory Diner (which I loved and was so upset when it closed). I was so happy to see the Bragg's people opened a new place.... and improved it with a full bar! The Coronado is a great place for coffee, drinks, breakfast, dessert and happy hour. They have a delicious cocktail that involves horchata...not sure what it's called, but it's fabulous. You can get this drink on the cheap until 7 pm.... I repeat, 7 pm!!! Hooray for late happy hours.   As good as their hh is, I think their breakfast is even better. They have an amazing egg sandwich served on a delicious flaky biscuit, topped with perfectly cooked veggies and a fabulously sweet/savory mustard sauce. I (almost) didn't miss the meat.   While your there, you have to get at least one baked good. I have had some amazingly delicious cookies and cupcakes here... the selection is always different and consistently impressive.   I highly recommend The Coronado to vegetarians and meat eaters alike!  PS 1500!!!",

    "text": "On both of my recent visits to The Coronado, expectations have been exceeded! On my first visit, I went with the guacamole fries ... Hand-cut fries topped with fresh guac and vegan chili.  That's pretty much a vegan's heaven for indulgence foods. I could not finish this order.  Ate about half of it and saved the rest for another meal.  I also had a small salad on the side which was perfect to lighten up my meal of fries!   The second visit I had the cauliflower tacos... I didn't think they could top the chili-guac fries, but they did!  I will definitely be back for those tacos!  I also got a s'mores cookie sandwich.  This was two choc chip cookies sandwiched with a fluffy vanilla-ish frosting type of substance.  It was good, DECADENT, but not like a s'mores.  I'm sort of a s'mores-aholic, so I'm a tough critic.  I should also note it was very oily.  Soaked through the paper baggie they put it in for to-go orders.  I'd suggest less butter substitute and darker chocolate in the cookie recipe, and something containing marshmallows on the inside filling.    Its a small place, but they've always had table open when I've stopped in towards the end of happy hour.  It is counter service, so place your order at the front, take your number and sit and wait for the deliciousness.",

Have had 3 postmates orders with the Coronado and all 3 were wrong. and when I called to let me know they simply said \"OK\" No sorry no we will do better. just \"OK\" Every item that had a quantity of more than one on our order they only sent one Not cool. We have people now in our office with no food even though they paid. Also might want to go over with the cook how to cook eggs ordered over medium got hard fried",

    "text": "My gf and I love The Coronado. The chill atmosphere, prompt service, and fresh food keep us coming back quite often.   They really should know us by name here, haha.   Her favorites are the vegan pancakes which they only offer on the weekends from 10am-2pm I believe. Never had better vegan pancakes.   We are both pretty fond of the potato tacos.   My personal favorite is the beet burger. I get it almost every time I go and it never fails me.   Also, this may sound basic but their fries too omg! Always on point and fresh!  It's counter service then everything else is self serv (napkins, forks, water, etc) so at times we've felt kind of like a burden asking for things. I'm not a fan of that aspect BUT it's really a laid back atmosphere and the staff is nice.   For sweets we go for the brownies and the muffins. Blueberry is my fave! Whoever bakes those things have very special hands.   They have fresh squeezed orange juice too (need I say more about that?) haha  Outside seating available(doggy friendly :)).  Bathroom photos scare me though. Can't go into the bathrooms alone bec I'm a wimp obvi.   Oh! And they just added stuff to the menu. I tried the fried chimichanga and YUM!   4 stars because the customer service can definitely be strengthened. I'm not wowed by it but my overall experience every time I go is worth returning for!",

    "text": "Without a doubt, the best meal of my recent trip through New Mexico, Arizona and southern California was at The Coronado in Phoenix. And -- much to my surprise and delight -- it was totally vegetarian/vegan!  This is not a fancy restaurant -- though it is somewhat quaint and quirky (check out the photos on the restroom walls). You order and pay at the counter, you get a number, you get your drinks at the bar, you select a table somewhere in the bungalow or on the patio, and you wait for your food to come.   I ordered a \"bean burger\" (a tepary bean and mushroom patty topped with roasted tomatoes, arugula & vegan mayo on a bun) along with fries and a beer. The flavor, the texture, the condiments, the bun, and the overall quality of the \"burger\" was excellent. Even meat eaters (such as I normally am) will be fully sated. And the fries were as good as any I have eaten at any establishment. Should a carnivore end up eating here with vegan friends (or by accident) the fries alone should satisfy them. A side of grilled street corn on the cob swimming in vegan mayo and dusted with spices was also quite good.   My only complaint -- and it is a small one -- is serving beer in pint jars. Yes, it assures me that I received a pint, but I like real beer glasses.  So -- herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores alike -- If you like tasty food you should be satisfied at The Coronado PHX.",

    "text": "I really want this to be our go to place for family breakfasts on the weekend because I have so many fond memories of weekend meals out with my family growing up and I want the same for my kids. And even though I go with my kids and I always see people there with kids, this is just not a family friendly restaurant. I can't quite figure out why. Maybe it's because when I ask for a side of fruit they look at me like I have 3 heads. How hard can it be to put some cut fruit in a bowl and upcharge by a magnitude of 10? Seems like an easy win. Maybe it's because of the contemptuous glares from the cashier person on repeat as my kids are joyfully playing games at our table. Sure they're loud, but they're not screaming in anger, we're talking sounds of children's laughter here. I would understand if this was Friday night fine dining, but it's Sunday morning, the doors are open and I can hear the city bus offloading outside. Maybe it's because they can't seem to serve plain pancakes before 10am. It doesn't seem like it would be that hard to do but they've assured me it is. I've asked. But honestly, it's probably because they don't want to be family friendly. Or benefit of the doubt, maybe they don't know they're not family friendly because not enough of the staff has kids. It's one of the two. Don't get me wrong, I get that it's not their job to cater to me and my 2 year old twins. I'm just putting this out there in case anyone else shared my longing for a family friendly vegan spot. I'll still be looking and going to Scramble for now where I can get vegan french toast and be home before 10am. And I'll probably still come to Coronado every few months hoping for that fruit cup and early morning pancakes because I'm a glutton for punishment.   Shout out for the always delish food and the nice guy who offered me a bag when he saw me trying to manage the diaper bag, a toddler and 2 take out boxes.",

There were lots of interesting looking restaurants but my husband had heard of this place so decided to dine here.   We parked on the side street because near noon the parking lot was already full. We walked in through the patio and entered the old house which is now the restaurant. It was cozy and lively music was playing. We grabbed a menu and stood in a short line. I was in the mood for a big juicy burger. That was not to be the outcome. This place is vegetarian and vegan. The burgers didn't look appealing to me but the menu was very interesting. We both decided on the huevos rancheros and what a score! They were delicious. We were served two corn tortillas topped with a veggie chili, light cheese and two perfectly cooked eggs. I was full by the time we were finished. I really wanted to try something from the pastry case but I am still eating light after a glutinous Thanksgiving. Darn it!    Service was friendly and food came out on a reasonable time in spite of the noon hour. I'd go back and be more adventurous next time and I'll grab a scone there too!",

I picked the fried guacamole, which was pretty standard, and the red bean quesadilla. I didn't think this would be good, but it was amazing! It's savory with red peppers and a nacho cheeze sauce on top and they provide huge portions. I only ate half and saved the rest for later - unfortunately, the tortilla got soggy so it wasn't as good the next day.",

Come into the Coronado at any time and you'll find some sort of cash collection jar for local LGBTQ+ rights groups or even for raising protest money for fighting the Dakota pipeline. Every employee has been nothing but kind, even during their busiest times.   Recently, I've been calling in my orders to go on my way home from class and they've still provided the same great, quick service. Some of my favorites include the cauliflower tacos, biscuits and gravy, fried guacamole, and breakfast sandwich with tofu. Drink wise, you can't go wrong with a nice chai, and they're always happy to make it according to taste, whether you prefer a more spicy chai or sweet. They've recently expanded the parking availability, but there is also plenty of street space if you turn down Monte Vista. Thank you Coronado for continuing to nourish Phoenix.",

Adds a perfect sweetness and coolness factor to the chili, which is a bit spicy. Amazing first experience! Beautiful, hip atmosphere; it's a house converted into a restaurant. Love that kind. And service was great. They should keep to-go silverware where it's in reach of the customers because I had to ask for mine, but other than that I have no complaints. Their fresh baked pastries looked to die for... pretty sure they're all vegan... I was so tempted but I had just come from Dark Hall Coffee (the Coronado's sibling) so I told myself \"another day Maddie... they'll always be here\". Dark Hall will be my next review! All good things at the Coronado. Highly recommend for a vegetarian/vegan, or even for an omnivore because the menu is mostly plant based instead of meat-alternative-based, not so much soy or seitan but instead just vegetables in the entrees.",

I got the cauliflower tacos. The breaded cauliflower is salty and well spiced. Very tasty! The creamy orange sauce on it was lost, not much flavor. I had to search for the guacamole, seems there was a little on the bottom of the tortilla.   The cauliflower was so bomb but I longed for an acidic slaw on it to cut the saltiness of the cauliflower - which was the only other thing I tasted. What can I say? I'm a bold flavors girl.   I'd come back to try other dishes and enjoy the funky house scene. Definitely worth a try.",

    "text": "I miss Bragg's Diner.  I'm not a vegan, not even a vegetarian.  But Bragg's had some darn good food.  Their Grand Ave restaurant was also set in what was originally the old Bragg's Pie Factory.  And Bragg's Diner lived up to the building's namesake with some delicious sweet treats.  Unfortunately, Bragg's is now long gone.  But the owners of Bragg's quickly reappeared in the building that once housed the old Coronado Cafe.  After a failed attempt to resurrect the Coronado Cafe by the previous owners, Bragg's owner Liam Murtagh and his crew transformed the old cafe into The Coronado.  Just like Bragg's the food here is primarily vegan with a few non-vegan items mixed in.  Let's see what Murtagh has come up with shall we?  The restaurant itself has a very old soul.  The bones of the building on 7th Street and Monte Vista are relatively unchanged after all these years.  There's some noticeable changes in the decor from The Coronado's prior iterations, but overall the setup is the same.  An old house with multiple small rooms on the inside and a roomy patio area on the outside.  Order at the front counter, grab a number, pick a seat.  I picked the tiny corner room in the back where there's seating for just six.  Its a quaint but cozy little corner and there are shelves upon shelves of board games and books back there.  Perfect little area to kill time reading, chatting with friends, or play one of those board games.  For my first go around here, I decided on a burger.  Ah but I did say this place is primarily vegan didn't I?  This burger is made using garbanzo beans and red potatoes.  Topped with spinach, tomato, and agave mustard.  The bun almost has the texture of a hardened buttermilk biscuit, though thankfully not as flaky.  Came with a side of fries.  Also got one of their house made cherry pop tarts because, well it was just staring at me from the pastry case.  Total cost including tax came to about $16.  Admittedly more expensive than a burger meal you'd get elsewhere, but healthier options often are.  The burger was pretty solid.  The difference in texture from a regular burger was noticeable, but for the most part that didn't take away from the flavor profile.  The mustard was definitely the star of this dish.  Not too spicy, but had just enough to give it a little kick.  Very clean flavors and not heavy at all.  The fries were also cooked just right.  Would've liked a little more cherry filling in my pop tart than I got, but it was still a satisfactory dessert.  Overall a good meal and pretty much in line with the type of meals I remember eating at Bragg's.  So now you have three distinct options on 7th Street if you're a vegan.  Green, Nami, and now The Coronado.  The atmosphere here was super chill like that of a coffee house.  The crowd and staff here during my visit were pretty progressive (borderline hippie in some spots), but friendly and relaxed.  Like I said, I'm a carnivore but even I can appreciate when a vegetarian establishment hits on a good concept.  Bragg's had a winning formula for years.  It appears The Coronado has found its mojo too.",

Love the outdoor and indoor seating areas. The menu has a lot of options for vegans/vegetarians and I had a hard time deciding what to get. I wish I'd been hungrier to try more foods but that day I had something light the \"good morning sandwich\" which was great. My friend's ordered Red potato and garbanzo burger, chorizo tacos (I hear are super popular) and the veggie hummus plate. We all loved our food very much. Service was perfect, wouldn't change a thing, will definitely come back!",

The highlight of the menu for me is the cauliflower tacos, but if I'm not willing to indulge in such a high calorie dish I will skip eating here.   Coronado is definitely a place where I'm consistently shocked by how expensive my order is--a drip coffee and a chia pudding for $9?! Vegetarian tacos and a latte--$15?!

    "text": "My wife and I ate at The Coronado on May 27, 2017 while traveling across the country.  We had the cauliflower tacos, avocado toast, biscuits and gravy with tofu scramble on the side.  The overall meal was good.  I always enjoy a restaurant doing something with cauliflower and I recommend the avocado toast.  Even though it sounds plain, the quality of the bread complimented the dish.   Sadly, due to their public anti-law enforcement stances against Phoenix hiring more police officers and their ignorant views of how police are hurting their community; I can not support their establishment.  Phoenix PD is 1,200 officers short for a city of that size and emergency calls can take up to 15 minutes for law enforcement to respond.  The owners Emily and Liam's anti-police stance are so strong they went to a city hearing to oppose any hiring of police officers and make statements of how law enforcement \"hurts\" the community.  Up until these public statements, my wife and I were planning to go back during our next trip in June.  Now, I am not going to return.  The owners did not know it at the time, but I am a law enforcement officer.  This knowledge of their anti-police views effected my remembrance of my experience there.  So, I am giving two stars for the food and knowing my hard earned money went to help a place that does not welcome law enforcement, which means I was not welcome there.   I hope Yelp keeps my review.  I am an actual customer of this restaurant and their anti-police stances effected my experience of eating there.  Yelp allows other reviews that go beyond the quality of food and this review is no different than other criticisms for cleanliness, decor, and attitude of the servers/owner.  My review is no different.  Since the owners wanted make public their negative views about members of their community  (law enforcement), that should be taken in consideration when making my review of my experience there.  I would have never went to the place if I known I am not welcome. I wished I never gave money to them.",

    "text": "One thing that I'm rather embarrassed to admit upfront is that I've never had a purely vegan meal. Not to belabor the point, but the Coronado has definitely sold me on the proposition of eating a strictly plant based cuisine. Definitely not going to make declarative statements comparing this to other vegan establishments in the valley, but I would recommend this for anybody who wants to either try that branch of cuisine or wants a low key place to grab a tasty meal.   The first thing that sticks out to me is the building itself. It's in a retrofitted older house in the Coronado neighborhood of Phoenix, and that gives it some character. Cramped is a word that you could easily use to describe the interior; I felt like I was about to run into somebody else on a few occasions while inside. I also want to point out the rad pictures in one of the restrooms, just a bunch of kids wearing creepy masks. It doesn't add much overall, but it was enjoyable in a weird way.   As for the food, this is the most positive part about the establishment. My dining companion and I ordered a hummus plate to share, and they had the chorizo tacos with eggs and I had the cauliflower tacos. The hummus plate was delicious; it comes with cucumbers, carrots, fresh jalapenos, and chips. The texture was a little on the chunkier side, but it paired well with the vegetables on the plate. The cauliflower tacos exceeded my expectations by having this tangy, crunchy edge. The guacamole in it also helps tie it all together. It definitely set a high bar for vegan meals in the future. I can't comment on the faux chorizo in those tacos, but my companion had nothing but good things to say about them. Last thing to point out is they have a good drip coffee offering, and it's cool that it has self refills.  So if you want to get some vegan food, this is a place to get it. There may or may not be better vegan options in the area, but to reiterate this was my first experience with vegan cuisine. There are some concerns about the overall tightness of the space here, but it's not enough to ruin the entire experience.",

    "text": "I was so looking forward to eating here after reading the reviews.  But, I realize now that the rating is high because there are few alternative vegan/vegetarian places in Phoenix. The breakfast was fine, just not all what I was hoping for.    Breakfast tofu eggs were spiced but, it was one-note, nothing special.  Breakfast potatoes (fried russet) were served hot but very bland (no veggies, etc).  Avocado on toast came with arugula, sprouts, cashew pesto -- sounds good but did not add up to great.    The herbal tea was amazingly good, as was the service, both at the counter and in the kitchen.  The folks working here are awesome.  The cafe has a choice of seating areas that make it a wonderful choice for small groups, as well as singles eating alone.  The Coronado was fine.  And, for Phoenix it may be outstanding.  But, if you've had good vegan breakfasts elsewhere (Tucson Bentley's; Salt Lake City Vertical Diner, etc), then the Coronado won't meet your expectations.  But, if you are lazy and don't feel like cooking breakfast for yourself, then the Coronado is the place to go.",

The blonde woman who was helping other customers saw us and went back to talking to them. They had already finish ordering but still chatting. I stood there. A waiter thought we were there for a pick up, I clarified and that we were there eat inside and he said \"oh\". And walked away. Finally it was our turn but the lady at the cashier ignored us. Went back to what she was doing, did not say \"Hi\" or \"Ill be right with you\". She just walked away. I stood there for another couple minutes before deciding to leave.

But our order took 1 hour to get ready, and it wasn't that busy. One of my friends had to leave before because we didn't realize it would take that long, so she couldn't even try her meal. When it finally arrived, the waitress was completely lost. She couldn't say what the dishes were, we had to figure it out by ourselves by opening the burgers and sandwiches. After we were done eating, she comes back with another plate asking if it was ours   I liked the food, but it's not worth the waiting.",

Then the delicious cauliflower tacos. Yummmm. The bakery treats are pretty tasty as well. I also like getting the tofu scramble. So good. I would definitely recommend this place to vegans, vegetarians or anyone that would like to eat a bit healthier.",

    "text": "Visit number two and still unimpressed.   I didn't mentioned in my first review; but the order at the counter concept does not work with their layout. Not at all. It's awkward and cramped.   I can see how it could take quite a bit of time when there is only one person taking orders, making drinks, and answering the phone. The counter gal seemed to be frustrated. She received a phone call from someone trying to order two burgers. She sternly affirmed they were a vegan restaurant and offered no alternative options. She seemed off put and didn't have the best customer service skills, especially when it came to informing meat eaters that vegan restaurants offer 'great food' still!   As a previous bartender I also found it slightly humorous when a female customer asked for a 'really light beer' and she suggested an IPA. She followed with orange blossom which was a much better option. Well there's my nit picky service review.   Food- got the cauliflower tacos. Wanted to love them because I was starving. Over all presentation was great. But I had to add Cholula sauce to give it any flavor. I could hardly taste the red(?) avocado cream dressing. The corn tortillas were also hard :/ the cauliflower was nicely fried but still lacked flavor.   I look forward to the next vegan restaurant...  But hey; thanks for existing. I still chose to come to the Coronado instead of their near by competitor Green. I still vote for vegetables instead of soy based processed mock meats.",

The potato tacos were actually just really crispy little potato squares, without any sauce really, wrapped in a crappy corn tortilla. The deep fried guacamole looks like a little turd on the plate in the middle of some chips, and the drinks were so so. It's just not a good place to sit and eat with people, because there is not a lot of room, and you order at the coffee counter. I've heard it is an awesome coffee shop, but I would stick to that. It just wasn't at all what I expected.",

I can't speak much to their speediness, since I called in a pick-up order and couldn't get out of work very quickly, so arrived at the restaurant about 15 minutes after my estimated pick up time. But, it was ready and they were very friendly. I do think the prices are more than I'd like to spend on a regular basis, but I will definitely be returning here for lunch frequently. I can't wait to try the fried guacamole.",

The portions were smaller than I'm used to, and I didn't even finish my food because of how bland everything tasted. I ordered the chili and guacamole fries. I also tasted the cauliflower tacos and the market vegetable scramble with tofu. Not a lot of places have managed to master a tofu scramble so I didn't expect much from it, but I did expect the cauliflower tacos to taste a lot better. The chili guacamole fries were super dry. The fries seemed like they were sitting out for a bit because they were super dry and the only thing that made them seem warm was the chili on top of it. The best thing I had their was the iced jasmine green tea. The tea was really flavorful. Needless to say I spent $30+ for mine and my BF food and I left hungry and disappointed. I normally expect to pay more for vegan food, but it's usually because it is full of flavor and variety. This place reminded me why people think vegan food is tasteless. There are definitely better vegan spots out there. The I would give the food 1 star, but the set up of this place 4 stars because it is really cute and quaint. The tea easily gets 5 stars! Probably won't be back unless I want some more tea.",

I can't believe it took me this long to try it.  It has muddled cilantro, cucumber, and serrano peppers, made with tequila and Cointreau. It is spicy and refreshing! I had the street corn as an appetizer, which was delicious, and the calabacitas burrito. So freaking good.  Another new favorite of mine off the menu. I don't know what the sauce they serve on the side is,  but it was a spicy chipotle-y awesomeness and I want it on everything. I took a bag of Xanadu coffee and a piece of peanut butter chocolate cake to go. The cake is rich, and moist, and amazing.

    "text": "I traveled for a day to Phoenix and although I am not Vegan or Vegetarian I still enjoy vegan/vegetarian food! With that being said I love a good beef burger BUT I also love a good Veggie burger and this place rocks on the Veggie Burgers.  Real quick before I rave about the veggie burger.  Parking is on the street and limited, I happened to LYFT all around town.  I sat outside and phoenix is Very HOT but this restraint had it covered with misters that surrounded the outside seating area of the restaurant I felt a little spoiled and definitely taken care of.  The inside is a little small maybe seating about 30 people with small bar table facing the window seating maybe 3-4.  The people were friendly and service was great!!  Anyway back to that RED POTATO & GARBANZO BURGER OMG!! Amazing the burger was soft but not sloppy, flavorful and it sat on a buttermilk bun that did not fall apart the bun definitely handled the burger staying in tact not becoming soggy!! there were tomatoes, spinach, and vegan mayo & agave mustard!! Heaven to my taste buds served with a small side of fries.  Now I love fries and the fries were homemade fries cut from potatoes not skinny little matchstick fries.  I was being greedy thinking that I would want a 2nd helping but Nope I had just enough fries to get by.   Please enjoy and don't forget to try their deserts I believe that I had a vegan chocolate chip cookies!!   Prices are not bad at all ranging from $4-20. with happy hour and brunch specials on the weekends.  Order and delivery available with DoorDash and Postmates.  Enjoy",

The service system is that you order at the counter , then choose a seat indoor or outdoors and the food is served at your seat. The have great vegetarian and vegan options which was something we loved. We started with the fried guacamole which was simply amazing, the sauces on the chips are definitely worth a try. For mains we ordered the cauliflower taco which had cripsy fried cauliflower bits with a delicious sauce. We also tried the garbanzo and potato burger which was well made. On the whole, pretty place, friendly staff and simply good food.",

I started to read a book while there! The environment was laid back and lots of people were there conversing and doing work on laptops. Check on my pictures below!   Vegan biscuits and gravy  Mmm mmmm mmmmmm. Home style cooking! Really tasty and tasted just like non vegan biscuits and gravy would have. I would have liked for it to have a little more flavor but it was still filling.   Vegan Spiced muffin  Yum!!! Probably my favorite dish that I had. It was extremely moist and just the right amount of sweetness. It wasn't heavy like the biscuits and gravy and tasted perfect for a breakfast dish or snack. It also was very fresh and a decent size.   Vegan Fried avocado with chips  Wow! What a unique spin on the traditional guacamole and chips. This dish was beautifully prepared and had a slight kick to it. The fried avocado was nice and crispy and there was a perfect amount of chips for dipping. I loved the avocado sauce drizzled on top.   Tofu scramble breakfast Sammy ( I can't remember the exact name)  Such a Flavor packed breakfast sandwich  loaded with some fresh veggies like mushrooms, spinach, and tomatoes. Usually when I try to make a tofu scramble at home, it never turns out right. But this definitely hit the spot. I wish the bread choice was different because it seemed to crumble and fall apart.",

The young man who helped us order couldn't have been more patient (I was obviously indecisive because of the overwhelming amount of vegan AND gluten free options!), and the interior is charming and inviting. We went with the homemade Horchata and Bloody Mary for drinks, split a \"deconstructed\" breakfast burrito (half flour tortilla, half corn to make it GF), and the GF Snickerdoodle Blondie. Highly recommend all 4! This place is a must-go for any plant-based visitor or native to the Phoenix area.",

I know there's only so much that can done to rewire these spaces, so just come here with a full battery.",

It's furnished and decorated with interesting art which makes it a cool environment to be in. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall a good vibe, both indoor and outdoor seating with heaters outside to keep warm during winter. The bathrooms are also very clean.  The fried guacamole was interesting and rather tasteful. It was more of a try once type of thing for me but I'm sure plenty of people will fall in love with it. The cauliflower tacos on the other hand totally won me over. They're the best vegan tacos I've had in Phoenix. Be sure to ask for a side of cilantro to throw on top of the tacos. The ketchup that cane with the fries was interesting. It seemed as if they added cinnamon or something. It wasn't exactly my cup of tea. Not a big coffee drinker but it seems like this is one of the more popular small coffee shops around town.",

Today I called @ 920 am (Az time) to place a takeout order. I was asked to hold and waited 7 minutes. I ended the call since no one came back to the line and called again. The second time I was placed on hold for 5 minuets, I ended the call since no one came back to the line (again) & called back a 3rd time. During the 3rd attempt of calling to place an order I was placed on hold for 11 minutes. After the 11 minute hold the person who took my order didn't apologize for the wait. I find this to be very unprofessional and rude.  Moving on..... There is literally only one cash register available. It would be within the establishments best interest to invest in another register to provide better service for customers who are in a hurry (especially after being placed on hold several times.)  I don't advise anyone to phone takeout orders during the weekend. It's crowded and understaffed.",

I have been back several times since and my service and the food has been nearly perfect. Each time, it was like it always was before my ONE bad experience. Then the other day, I wanted to order a platter for NY girlfriend's birthday celebration at work. I placed the order, set the pickup time, and the Manager I dealt with took very good care of me. To top that off, I kept having to switch my pickup time, and he was very nice and helpful each time. I feel bad it took me this long to write this update but every time I thought about doing it, I got busy. I would like to add, that after my original review, a manager did reach out to me but I never responded. I'm guessing the girl that helped me the first time probably had some things on her mind that had her upset because I have never had a bad experience before or since that day. Hey, we are all human. I am back to loving The Coronado and that makes my girlfriend happy as I am also back to bringing her the califlower tacos she enjoys so much.",

Really you can't go wrong, everything I've had there is excellent, and I honestly think I've eaten every vegan option on their menu!!  Soooo good!!  HIGHLY recommended!!!!

Seriously delish food for veggies and non-veggies alike. We wound up coming back for a second bite before the end of our trip, by request of the meat-eating mother. I ordered the tofu chorizo tacos and fried guacamole the first trip, and the potato tacos the second trip.  Totally worth the second trip. Can't wait to visit next time I'm in town",

I have never been to this restaurant before and I had questions that I didn't get to ask. My husband and I wanted to try a couple of different items since we didn't know when we would be in the area again, but every time we were cut off and she was giving us our total. At one point I asked her to hold on that I wanted to order more. The other reason for the 4 stars is space. This place is TINY and you have to keep walking around hoping someone gets up and you can get a place to sit. We finally found a seat and then came the food :-) I ordered the cauliflower tacos which were delicious! My husband had the red potato and garbanzo bean burger which was also really good. He loved the fresh cut fries and couldn't stop talking about how good the ketchup was. I had to try the burger and  we both agreed that it was probably one of the best vegan burgers we have had. Next, we tried the fried guacamole. I know that there are great reviews about the guacamole ( that's why we tried it) but we didn't care for it and I LOVE guacamole. The guacamole was lacking in flavor. The fresh made tortilla chips were over cooked. We would not order that dish again. The menu had lots of other items that sounded yummy so we will be back. Oh, I forgot to mention the weird pictures of people that hang in the bathroom. You have to check them out!",

Pastries were delicious, I preferred the scone. Scramble was yummy and came with homemade hot sauce which was a treat. Tacos were crispy and delicious. The pepitas on top were a lovely touch.

    "text": "The Coronado is a quaint little vegetarian restaurant right in the heart of the Coronado Historic District. It is a small revamped house that emanates a cozy coffeehouse atmosphere.  I have visited the Coronado twice before and was really impressed with the service, atmosphere, and food. I decided to take my husband there for lunch since he's never been to a vegetarian restaurant. When we first walked in, the tables and couches were full, so we decided to sit outside. This was fine since with us since Phoenix is finally coming into fall season! The patio is dog-friendly which is nice for dog lovers like myself. Ordering is done at the bar (yes, they serve alcohol!), which can be a little crowded when busy. The bar had fresh flowers by the ordering station which was a nice touch (I love plants!).  It took about five minutes for someone to acknowledge us. The employees seemed a little under pressure due to what they said were \"mess ups\".  They did apologize for the wait though. They offer delivery service and online ordering, so I'm sure that might have something to do with the somewhat chaotic vibe that I felt.  After receiving a sincere apology for the wait, I decided to order two farmyard scrambles and a goat cheese quesadilla. When the employee read back the order, it was wrong so I ended repeating myself two more times. Our food seemed like it took a while to come out but maybe it's because we started feeling the afternoon heat. Luckily they turned on the misters to keep us cool!  When our food finally did come out, our vegetable scrambles were made with tofu instead of eggs. So we had to send the order back and wait a while longer. It wasn't too big of a big deal since we were sharing the goat cheese quesadilla, which was AMAZING! The quesadilla was a little soggier than last my last visit (I prefer crispy quesadillas). The quesadilla contained goat cheese and a homemade jalapeno marmalade. At $6, it was worth every penny!  After devouring half of the quesadilla, the Farmyard Scramble finally came out. It consisted scrambled eggs and locally grown vegetables such as green beans, squash, and sweet potatoes. Also included was a house made spicy sauce on the side that was pretty tasty.  I enjoyed the entree but it was a very small portion and a little on the pricey side at $9 each.  After my meal, I decided to try some coffee: a large latte with soy milk. The employee told me that they would bring it out to me when it was ready. I waited for what seemed more than enough time for a coffee to be made. I ended up going inside to check and it was just sitting on the bar. Not really a big deal under normal circumstances, but my sole intention for visiting the Coronado this past Monday was to leave a review on Yelp! Unfortunately I must have caught them on a bad day. On the plus side, the coffee was full of flavor. Probably the best coffee that I've tasted in a long time.   Sadly, my husband wasn't too impressed with the customer service or food so it probably won't be a place that I will frequent with him. I will go back for two reasons: the goat cheese quesadilla and the coffee. I really think that I caught them on an off day. The Coronado has a unique atmosphere, a full bar, exquisite coffee, and a palatable vegetarian menu. I'm giving four stars instead of five because of the pricing and inconsistency with the customer service.",

A friend of mine described it as \"a mix between Lux and Braggs\" (RIP), something I definitely agree with after visiting.  The bar is also the counter you order food from, and is covered in fresh pastries in little glass cases. They had plenty of cookies, tarts, pies, and even a pineapple cake. Water, napkins, and silverware are all self-serve. Seating is also DIY, and while it's limited inside the tiny rooms, there's a huge patio on the side and even a few tables in the front.   My husband and I are obnoxiously small eaters, so we split the jackfruit siders and fries. I nearly licked the plate clean! Flavor and texture was awesome. Spicy mayo was perfect. Between the two of us, it was the ideal amount of food. Even with a full stomach, though, I couldn't help eyeing the Monte Vista Torta ordered by the table next to us. It was gorgeous, and something I will definitely be trying on my next visit.",

Being my first time I asked a lot of questions about the food on the menu.  The avacado sauce? Yep, vegan.  The Santa Fe Sauce? Yep, vegan.  The delicious looking vanilla bean and orange marmalade cake and other delicious looking pastries? You guessed it, vegan! They even had a vegan horchatte (horchata and espresso)! I can definitely say with certainty that I was fully satisfied when I left, only barely stopping myself from buying the remainder of the vanilla bean orange marmalade cake that was left to smuggle into the show I was attending with my friend and a couple of forks.  Barely resisted.  Like almost gave in. I will definitely be back again as often as I can make it as there was a lot more food I wanted to try.  As for the cake, it better not be there the next time I go or I may not be able to resist.  Is it wrong to want to go to a restaurant just to eat an entire cake and a horchatte?",

I didn't catch a name from anyone, but they were way beyond helpful and kind. The woman behind the bar with glasses especially, I REALLY liked her. I wasn't sure which menu items were vegan, so I went up to ask her and she explained that their sauces are all made there and vegan. The best part? The pastries are vegan and they're to die for.  I ate the Jalapeno Waffle and a Snickerdoodle. SO SO SO good. This was the most delicious waffle of my life and I don't even care that I paid $8 for a little waffle, it was that good. Unfortunately, they were out of the Biscuits and Gravy that my mom had ordered (we walked in late morning/lunch time) so she had some avocado pesto sandwich that I don't know the name of. She said that was incredibly good, but she kept raving about how good the ketchup was. Because that item was unavailable after we had ordered, a man brought us over a box of pastries (PB and chocolate cookie, snickerdoodle and a cranberry scone). This was so unnecessary, but extremely kind and secured a return visit. Those freaking pastries will win me over each and every time. I didn't realize how close they were to Nami, but I won't be going there again after visiting here. Better parking, better staff, better atmosphere all around.",

The pictures in the bathrooms were uber-creepy, reminded us of Season One of True Detective, but the rest was all tasteful and adorbs. We had the biscuits and gravy, jalapeno waffles and a spicy dirty chai. It was all delicious! The service was amazing, friendly and fast. Although we did not partake, it looks like they have a liquor license and have a happy hour. I can only hope that this location will keep busy since they have a bit of competition right across the street from Green and Nami. Although no alcohol is served at the other spots. Everything is vegetarian here and mostly vegan. Can't wait to go back and try it for dinner!",

My friend ordered the Huevos Rancheros and although she thought they were a little small in portion for the price, she said they were really good.

My friend and I shared some of it. Cute little place and I will definitely be back to try the pastries that looked really unique and good.

We were rushed through the line during Sunday brunch and when my friend asked whether they could add vegan cheese the girl taking her order got slightly preachy about how they don't serve any processed fake cheeses or meat.  A simple \"sorry, no we don't\" would've been better.  Oh and by the way if you serve regular cheese isn't that just as processed as cheese made from nuts? Anyway I had the tofu veggie scramble with charred pea pods.  My friend had the breakfast sandwich which she said was a little dry, probably because the biscuit was too big compared to the filling and they don't use any of that \"processed\" cheese, butter or mayo to add moisture.  The desserts in the case did look good, but we ended up not buying any.",

We had several different entree's.  The street corn (I didn't care for it myself as the corn was really overcooked and hard to eat), the Monte Vista Torta (very good...with yummy baked fries), the Chili and Cornbread (also very good....almost as good as the chili and cornbread I make at home ;-), and the Goat Cheese Quesadilla with Jalapeno Marmalade (the star of the meal...we even ordered a second to share!)  I also had an Evergreen cocktail.  Basically a spicy margarita.  So good, but it was spicy!  Everyone who worked there was so nice and helpful.  Even the owner/chef came out and talked to us.

Inside we were immediately greeted by a friendly barista that gave us the ins and outs. I ordered the cauliflower tacos (they came highly recommended), my boyfriend got the chorizo tacos (made with tofu) and we split a side of fries. Everything was DELICIOUS!!! Bonus they have a fantastic game selection (Guess Who, Clue, Jersey Shore puzzle). It was a place I could easily spend all day. There was only one drawback- they have a great beer selection (if you like IPAs), but the beer wasn't super cold. I was probably the first to order one (it was 11:30AM), but I am a girl that likes an ice cold brew. Other than that it was a totally amazing experience!!",

Yes it has Vegan food! But delicious VEGAN FOOD!! So far I have had the Calabacitas Burrito, lots of good fresh veggies in a yummy tortilla! I did let them know I would prefer if the veggies were cut up smaller. The lady who I told was so nice about listening to me. I have also had the Goat Cheese Quesadilla not my favorite, I love Goat Cheese but it was just too much for me. The Jalapeno Marmalade was excellent though! My absolute favorite is the Black Coffee Chili and Cornbread!!! The Chili is full of yummy beans corn and lots of other veggies! But the spice is PERFECT! It has a nice kick to it! And the Cornbread is outstanding! Who knew Vegan butter was so good! I also love their breakfast and coffee! Now the bakery items are in a category in there own! Everything is displayed by the coffee bar and EVERYTHING is delicious and addicting! I have had the cookies and a Chocolate Cherry Scone! Both are out of this world good! This place is literally steps away from my desk at work so it is very dangerous!! Please give The Coronado a chance! Great friendly people who really care about the food and drinks they are serving! My only complaint is.. I wish they would decorate for Halloween! That old house is perfect for Halloween..my favorite holiday! ;)",

I found the potato tacos to be dry. The chips with the guacamole were chewy. The salad was expensive for what it was.  2. Went during Happy Hour and the beer I got was $5+tax and served in a 10?oz glass. I'd hate to see how much that little beer would cost during regular hours.  3. Came with our 18-month old. No highchairs.  Space is nice, both indoors and out; service was good. Patio is dog-friendly.",

Whether you're looking for uniquely delicious breakfast fare (jalapeno waffles and a horchatte - yes, I did spell that correctly and it's exactly the beverage combo you'd expect!), fresh pastries, lunch (potato tacos!), happy hour (signature cocktails, locally sourced vino), dinner (jackfruit sliders!)... they seriously have something for everyone in your crowd to drool over and you'll never notice that it's non-carniverous! Plus, they put a lot of effort into being a welcoming community spot, so there's also some fun event going on -- DJ spinning, board games, live music, storytellers. It's just one of those places you always want to be at -- like hanging out at your best friend's home but with way better food (sorry, best friend!) If you haven't been yet, it's totally worth checking out.",

The nice thing about this place is that they also have drinks and they will serve them with vodka instead of gin if that is what you like.

Today, though, I paid for my scone and macchiato since I'd left the coupon at home. Totally worth it. The espresso is up there with Giant. And the dark chocolate and cherry scone was appropriately sized, not a big box bakery Goliath. Perhaps too much raw sugar on top. I brushed a bit off.   The space offers a better feel than Coronado Cafe and Urban Vine (terrible name) did. Decor is Lux meets Cartel,  and the wood floor homifies it warmly.   Though no demitasse cups yet, the super-friendly and accommodating barista offered me the macchiato in a tiny glass jar. Worked for me.   $2 off signature cocktails during happy hour. A very intriguing lunch and dinner menu with nearly all entries vegan. Can't wait to go for weekend breakfast.   Welcome to the neighborhood.   UPDATE: Finally had lunch here. Just awesome. The server brought us some gratis potato tacos. Savory and delicious, but the double corn tortilla likely unnecessary. One will do.   I had the Monte Vista torta and the standout components were the salty zucchini and buoyant focaccia. A bit pricey at $11 but a solid lunch.   We had the back room for five of us. A bit echoey but cozy and private.   Can't wait to try the cocktails.",

It lasted me 3 meals. He got the quesadilla which was pretty thin and good, but could use some veggies inside or cabbage on top. A little thin and plain. He also got the tomato alcohol drink which was very, very tiny. I've never seen such a small amount of alcohol besides a shot. Would come back.

    "text": "Vegans and omnis, do yourself a favor and eat here. The Coronado is a great place to introduce vegan/vegetarian food to your non-veg family and friends, as everything can be made vegan or vegetarian, so they can ease into the foods they're more familiar with (e.g. choice of eggs or tofu, cotija cheese or vegan cheese). It's counter service, so if it's your first time, it's not clear if you order right away or take a seat, but the employees are friendly and seem to recognize right away if you need a little guidance. Every time I come back, I always try a new pastry (particularly a new vegan pop tart) and new entree and I've never been disappointed. Plus, I love that The Coronado doesn't rely on mock meats as a restaurant. While I'm definitely not one to shy away from mock meats, it feels like a more impressive and wholesome dining experience having food THAT good and not needing some version of mock chicken, beef, etc. I guarantee you'll find something you like, whether you swing by for a pastry and coffee or tacos during happy hour.",

Speaking of not getting what you want...don't ever come to this restaurant if you have literally any standards for customer services. I was overcharged for a drink and when asked for a refund of the price difference I felt as if I was the biggest inconvenience in the entire world.  I used to love this place but they changed their menu way too much as well as the horrible service I'd rather break my veganism and eat at McDonald's. At least the food would match the price.",

We could have got a half order of the biscuits and gravy and shared just one because their biscuits are pretty big. Loved that they were nice and soft and the mushroom gravy mmmm good. Overall, everything was great from the food to the friendly staff. If I wasn't visiting from out of town, I'd definitely be back to try more from this place.",

Maybe I've only visited during busy hours, who knows. Regardless, someone should always make an effort to make sure the tables look decent before new customers sit down.

We came storming over hungry and found relatively inexpensive, healthy, and tasty vegan food.  The garbanzo bean patty burger had nice blends of herbs. We also ordered chorizo taco made from tofu base that had powerful and juicy tastes.",

You place your order at the counter and then get a number that you take with you to a table, where your food will be brought to you. We decided to dine outside on the patio. Seating is pretty limited here but it's nice for small groups (up to 6).   I honestly wanted so many things on the menu but we had to settle for getting 2 things to share between us. We got the deep fried guacamole and the potato tacos. Deep fried guac honestly just sounds amazing because it combines two of my favorite things into one dish. It's basically a ball of guac that's crisp on the outside served on a platter of chips. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish - the only thing was that the tortilla chips were a little too thick for my liking. I would've liked thinner chips. The potato tacos were also amazing, but just had slightly too much cabbage on them. I'm sure next time I could just ask for less cabbage.   Also, the servings here are massive. The tacos order came with 3 massive tacos that were well stuffed. Not the tiny tacos that some places try to pass off as \"adult servings.\"   I can't wait to come back here and try more dishes off the menu. Next on my list are the chili guac fries and the red bean quesadilla. This place is a hidden gem in this city!",

It is especially fun at night with the strings of lights across the roof illuminating everything.   The food is also pretty good, but everyone knows that. We've been there for breakfast and lunch, and so far we're going to join the masses and say that the cauliflower tacos are the best things on the menu. I have enjoyed everything I've had there. I can't lie - it's not my favorite veg joint in the Valley - but it is up there.  And I have to give a shout out to the employees. Everyone I've run across there are super cool, super friendly, and super chill. The trifecta of a great service. I often think, \"Man, I want to be friends with you!\"   I like the vibe, I like the food, but I am not a super fan of the set up. It is kind of frustrating that there is no separate line for drinks, so if you want another drink during your meal, prepare to line up and wait a long time. It also seems like a bad business model because I would have gotten a second drink for sure last weekend if there wasn't 15 people in line, and the line usually moves sloooow. But I get it - it's popular. This is really just a secondary whine (in lieu of my second wine).",

My only negative is that they do not have a separate fryer for gluten free dishes. I would love to try the cauliflower tacos and other dishes but I can't because of the cross contamination. Occasionally they do have gluten free desserts which are quite tasty.  Parking lot is small but there is an abundance of street parking.

    "text": "The quick review: -Food is good, cauliflower tacos made it worth the stop. I'm intrigued to return for all of their different \"burgers\", and I enjoyed my handcrafted drink. Atmosphere is cramped and the self serve water and silverware makes it less appealing and more of a cafeteria than a restaurant.   The long.....Such a dichotomy of reactions and emotions evoking some deep thought. First, not so much on this place itself but more of a comment on a vegetarian/vegan restaurant in general. I found myself wondering if they had a meat option so I asked....they don't. I thought, hmmm practically every restaurant in America has a vegetarian/vegan option and vegans/vegetarians would be upset if they didn't. Heck even the last steak house I was at had a vegetarian burger. Doesn't it make sense that the vegetarian restaurant should have a meat option for a meat eater meeting his vegetarian friends for a meal?? I think so, and if vegetarian/vegans wish to cry foul anytime an option isn't available for them, well then it should be the same in reverse should it not?   Ok, enough of my soap box. The food we did have was quite good. As I said above in my quick review the cauliflower tacos were quite good. Even good enough that I have thoughts of blindfolding my meat Only eating friend and having him try them.    The fried guacamole is good but not necessarily because it's fried. Once you break it open it makes for a solid guacamole and the home made chips with the drizzled red sauce are quite delicious.   What to do with tipping. You walk in and can sit anywhere. Just order at the bar and get a number.  When paying, the tip screen comes up and I pretty naturally hit the 20% option and find a table. Then the food comes and we're asked if there is anything else they can get for us. I ask for a couple of waters to accompany our adult drinks and food. I'm then told that water is self serve and oh yes, so is silverware.  This may have been a bit too much self serve for me to tell you the truth. Hmm, well that's not True. It just certainly changes my impression of the type of restaurant it is. This puts their service level on par with the likes of Panera and such...tip accordingly for your taste. No one checked on us during our meal either. More drinks would mean a trip to the bar.   My margarita, by a different name (can't remember the name), was quite good and they have a good sized list of specialty drinks that I could definitely make a good night of.   Lastly, I was excited to see the game shelf but after opening several and finding out that none of them appear to contain the required parts and pieces was disappointed to find out it is more decoration than potential added fun. Also, particularly for an evening of meeting a couple friends for drinks, I would say this is a place better visited in the cooler months as the patio would be nice and the interior of this old house although quaint, is not exactly well air conditioned.",

The horchata shouldn't be called horchata , the waitress even called it horchateee which made me giggle. The chai was flavorless , the cauliflower tacos were crispy and the sauce on top was the best part, my husband had a chickpea burger but it was literally just mashed chickpeas on a bun. Nothing to write home about, my friends had the fried guacamole which I think is a cool concept but by the time it comes out the guacamole is brown and has that weird taste to it from the heat... maybe I'll give it another shot to update this review but overall I don't think I'll be going back.",

After you  order you pay at the counter with square which prompts you to tip 15 percent, 20 percent, or 30, which made me really uncomfortable when I am expected to get my own water and silverware. As far as food, we ordered coffee, alcohol, an appetizer, and four entrees. My son's avocado sandwich and my moms meal were brought out 10 minutes before the appetizer. We ordered my son's sandwich with no spinach but they added it anyway. I picked it off. He started complaining right away that his root beer smelled bad, and after smelling it myself it was clear that the glass was unclean, and smelled musty.   They added sauce on my husband's after he asked them not to, and when we complained they said oh well the guy taking the orders is new. After our meal i mentioned that the root beer smelled really badly and the bartender smelled it, admitted it smelled bad, but didn't really care and acted indigent. I ended up spending over fifty bucks for lunch, and no one left happy. Avoid avoid  avoid.",

When they realized how much time had lapsed since our order, they promptly gave us the lemonade and a mini cake, while we continued to wait. This cake reminded me of baked goods my grandmother made.  It was delicious and you could taste the home made in it.  Soon after, food arrived.  The cauliflower tacos were amazing and a zucchini sandwich with fries were great . The ketchup was different and we spent time trying to figure out the secret ingredient, which was cinnamon.  I will be back again.",

Everything on their menu looks so good and I can't wait to get back to try it all. They have everything from breakfast sandwiches to veggie burgers to tacos. This is a great spot for everyone-- whether you are vegetarian or not you will find some satisfying and tasty food here!  On my first visit I really went all out and ordered the special which was a beet burger with fries and a brown sugar poptart (because, duh) and one of their famous biscuits. The burger was so hearty and delicious. It was made from beets and quinoa and had a slightly sweet taste and topped with a smoky poblano corn mixture. Everything from the toasted bun, to the ketchup for the fries was spot on. (Seriously the ketchup is sooo good and I don't even like ketchup normally.) Of course the poptart was delicious and perfectly flaky and the biscuit with jam & butter was out of this world.   The service was also amazing. Everyone is so happy and nice at The Coronado and you can tell they enjoy what they do and take pride in their food. Such a great spot! I would HIGHLY recommend visiting The Coronado-- vegetarian or not!  I also heard they have a great happy hour that I am planning on checking out!",

To drink I ordered an iced tea, they actually don't even brew your glass of tea until you order it and then pour it in to a cup of ice to chill it. I chose green and it was good.

Then I saw The Coronado and it immediately struck my attention. I was going too fast to make a furious right turn, but I couldn't due to traffic and I spent the next 20 minutes winding through the back neighborhoods trying to find a way to get back to this place. Tip: put this in your GPS! Parking is behind the restaurant with very limited/compact spaces.   Once I walked into the cute house-style restaurant, I was greeted by two very friendly employees that introduced themselves, handed me a menu, and then asked if I wanted a cocktail. It was 11am on a Saturday, so I decided to ask if they had mimosas. She said that they weren't on the menu but she'd be happy to make one for me. How sweet!   I ordered the Irish breakfast with cage-free local eggs, beet sausage (vegan), irish soda bread (vegan), and rosemary potatoes (also vegan). When they served the meal to me, the sweet employee asked me if I needed anything else and chatted a little. She was so genuinely lovely and nice that it warmed my heart.   Just thinking about this, I am so happy! It was one of the best meals that I have ever had for breakfast. I am so very excited to go back each weekend and try everything on their menu!",

Look, all joking aside, I know I'll catch flack for this but to hell with it, what elevates Us above the tiers of the animal kingdom is the ability to laugh, and laugh at ourselves.   Don't take life to seriously, you'll never get outta here alive.   Truth is, I'm no stranger to plant-based meal plans & I've been a Coronado Fan-Girl (#Vagitarian) for a little over a while.   Their Facebook, their Social Media--I can only describe it as a Campaign against ignorance.   All I can say is: commendable...beyond admiration.   In the end, I'll leave you with this fact: the term 'Vegan', is an archaic Word from the Olmec translation for 'Bad Hunter'.   ;-)  I loved the vibe of this place. It's like an Oregon house Wizard Of Oz'ed down to A-Hell-I-Zona.   Whether you're a carnivore or or a Vagitarian--you are what you eat, all pun intended--I recommend you try Coronado.   Expand your mind, and if you don't like it, fine. All the more for me.   Best part for me is the family. I grew up without one and from watching the crew you could tell there was a lot of family in this old house.   To me, that's the best history/memories.

They take the time to get to know their regulars, and support so many amazing charities and organizations.  The food is AMAZING. The goat cheese quesadilla (they have a few non-vegan options) is my favorite. The fried guacamole and cauliflower tacos are so delicious. They have a rotating brunch menu too which always satisfies. Plus, they have the most amazing cocktails, and are always thinking up new concoctions! The atmosphere is adorable too; The Coronado has a huge patio and is inside an old house. Go visit The Coronado. Meet Emily and Elle. Eat, drink and be happy.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try this place, all vegan/vegetarian menu plus a coffee house, thought this would be my new spot. However, it was a bit disappointing. When I first walked in, it was extremely chaotic. It was hard to figure out where to order and seating is scattered inside and outside. I felt claustrophobic inside but the outside patio was spacious with large picnic tables. Maybe, it just happens to be busy on Sunday morning during the brunch hours but I definitely can't see myself getting work done in this environment. Also, my friend was able to locate only one outlet inside.     Now for the food, I decided to get one of each tacos: cauliflower, potato, and chorizo which they were happy to accommodate my request even though its not on the menu. I'm sure the potato tacos would have been really good if they weren't under cooked however, they were seasoned well and cut to the appropriate size. The chorizo taco was my least favorite, the only good part was the sauce. I got it with eggs, maybe its better with tofu. Lastly, the cauliflower taco was the only taco that made me say, Yes! Thank you for turning out right. The cauliflower was seasoned well and served with spinach. My friend got the chorizo tacos and she wasn't too happy with hers either.   While ordering, there were two treats in the display that caught my eye: the chocolate truffle, and the orange-chile brownie. I decided to go with the brownie and it was Ah---mazing! The brownie was dense with a kick of spice. The cream cheese and granulated sugar garnish complemented the chile brownie. It was the  best part of my meal.   I would probably return for their sweet treats and coffee/tea when it's not so busy and maybe give their potato tacos another try.",

Since I enjoyed it a lot before, I wanted to give the food a shot. I went in tonight and ordered my burger with salad and one of there alcoholic beverages. When we got our food, I was given French fries versus a salad. Not a big issue, but when I alerted the cashier about how I wasn't given a salad, she gave me major attitude and suggested my friend must've gotten the fries (she didn't). By the time I received my food, and halfway through my burger, I realized that I didn't have my drink yet. When I went up to ask about my drink, another cashier said \"you didn't pay for one.\" Well sis.... my 40 dollar check said otherwise. She said she would scroll through and check to see if I purchased one, but by that time I was finished with my meal. ANOTHER cashier came up to me and I asked her for a refund on my drink since I never received it. She was very, very nice and sweet and I wish I grabbed her name so I could shout her out but I didn't so thanks blue haired girl, you da best, and @coronado, keep her bc she's the one with the best attitude on your entire team. When you switch your menu, I didn't know that meant that you had to switch y'all attitudes too",

    "text": "This is a cute place to stop and have a bite to eat. The exterior was very welcoming with. Lots of great vegetarian and vegan choices to enjoy.  We went there later in the evening after flying in to the Phoenix airport. Indoor seating was limited and the tables ranged from 2-4 people at most. There was a back area that was reserved that could potentially seat 6 people but it because of space it would have a more intimate feel.  Seating outside was better and they had picnic tables that you could sit at along with machines that sprayed a light mist in to the air to keep the dry Arizona heat at bay. This restaurant has a more casual feel. You order your food at the bar/register, take a number, and then they bring your order out to you. We decided to go with more of their vegan fare. The cauliflower tacos were on point and the portions for tacos were surprisingly large if you are used to the authentic Mexican size tacos. I enjoy food with a little more seasoning but they were very well done nonetheless. The cauliflower inside was breaded and fried to perfection. The chili fries were hearty and satisfying.  I would recommend this place. It has a more intimate feel and is a nice casual place to relax with friends and talk.  I'm giving it four stars because I found the seating and space to be not that comfortable and I expect the ambience to be a little more upscale for the price of the food. Also, is a bit pricey, we paid 12 dollars for 3 tacos but the portions as I said were large so it kinda offset the cost for me mentally. I'm not sure if they are using organic vegetables and products which may explain the price but as I said the quality of the food was good. I'm also rating this restaurant a little lower simply because the food didn't make my tastebuds tingle.  I've had some amazing vegan food and this just wasn't up there for me. Funny side note: they had these creepy dolls in different spots in the restaurant (see my video). They said they were preparing for Halloween (it was only September at the time we visited) but personally, I'm scared of dolls and in my opinion this may lead to indigestion!  Weird choice of decoration!",

There is a sitting outside, but I do not recommend if you do not like to be toasted or burnt to crisp. There's a little shade, but not too much. The line starts outside if it's busy. Their door is small like a house door. They have a drink menu and main dish menu. They have a variety of mix drinks, but not so much on their main dish.   We ordered salad, chimichanga, avocado toast, burger, taco, biscuits with gravy. Their biscuits are pretty huge and can fill you up pretty well. My chimichanga was okay. I am not a vegan so I was looking for that meat taste on my tongue. There was not enough flavor on my chimichanga; a good sauce on the side may have made it better.   The alcoholic drinks are good. They have variety of it and they name their drinks after girl names. I think I had Ellaine and Lucy? Both are good drinks.   Overall service was okay. Nobody really helped us to choose and recommend their best in house. Parking is okay. Busy days, you'd probably have to park far because they have a small parking lot. Price was a bit pricey. 300 dollars for 6 people.",

    "text": "We got off the plane in Phoenix and realized we were going to need food for our rental-car-drive down to Tucson. Yes, we backtracked a little bit to get food from The Coronado, but I was, and still am, fine with it.  I quickly perused the menu on their website as soon as I could turn airplane mode off my phone - and my sister and I decided to get the same thing: the beet and quinoa burger with fries.   We got to The Coronado about 10 minutes before their closing time - so though it was late and dark outside, the set up was visibly very cute. It was smaller than I imagined, with people mainly sitting out front enjoying the weather.   This place seems to be an order-and-seat-yourself kind of establishment. We had a pick-up order, but with only one iPad to \"square\" our payment, we had to wait in a small line while others ordered. This place is a little pricier than I was expecting (13.50 for a burger), but it was vegan and tasty and well needed at 9pm. (It's all vegetarian/vegan from what I could gather...)  I was sad that we were taking our food to go, as I would have liked to check out the atmosphere and set up a little bit more, but Tucson was calling. It seems like it'd be a fabulous place for locals, cute, quaint, rustic.  The Beet+Quinoa burger was tasty. I had opted for this particular burger because of the toppings: corn poblano relish, fried crispy onions. This is definitely a burger for those who prefer the earthier taste of beets - it was a deep red/pink color and tasted of the fresh root. Mmmm. There was ketchup that came with the fries - and it was unlike any ketchup I've ever had. I assume it was a house-made condiment, but it was sweet! It tasted like there was cinnamon and sugar in it - creating a ketchupy, churro batter flavor. It was interesting and definitely shook up the meal.    Food is never ideal eating in the car, and in a perfect night this meal would have been enjoyed in-house. However, I'm glad we made the backtrack trip to check them out. It needs to be another stop in my future, because their fried guacamole has left me with questions and cravings.",

    "text": "So I'm back here in Phoenix for the third time visiting and every time I come out here, I look for vegan food - specifically tacos!   So thanks to this lovely app, I found this restaurant.  I must say Phoenix has a lot of vegan places to choose from, unlike Cincinnati.  But this place is interesting and it's kind of small - I was curious how the sitting was going to go, but it worked out.  They offer outside seating, which I like. They have the mist machine going to keep you cool.  The inside is interesting in a good way. I like that they have desert and the drink selections right there where the counter is.  The place is pretty clean and open for the most part, doesn't feel crowded.  Now the good part - I ordered the chorizo tacos and I must say, they are delicious!   I got it with tofu and the flavors were all there! It didn't have the spicy chorizo flavors completely, but none the less it was a delicious combination of other flavors. The tacos didn't make me feel full and sluggish, which I like!  I also had some of the lemonade, that was pretty good. It was a little too sweet for me, but I don't eat a lot of sweet foods. I like more tartness from lemonade- but it was still yummy ! I also ordered the raspberry scone and I can't wait to try it. It looks great! Overall- awesome place!!  I will be back to try more food.",

So with that said they do not take reservations- so get in and grab a table! The menu is so great but we both just wanted to try the vegan chili. Soooo good! The other mind numbing piece though is the cornbread that accompanies it. It was the moistest cornbread I have ever had! And this is without butter! We also ordered a couple really great craft cocktails. I currently need to go back to try the other menu options.   If you are looking for a great vegan meal with great cocktails this is your place!",

    "text": "Another local gem I discovered thanks to Yelp, The Coronado Phoenix. I've probably driven by a hundred times and never even noticed but now that I've been in it's obviously a great spot! Centrally located and directly on 7th street for easy access.   I really appreciated the casual and innovative vibes of this establishment. Lots of delish and original vegetarian that actually feel satisfying and inspired. Add a lot of adult indulgences is a nice unexpected bonus. The dog friendly patio is a welcome amenity.   The interior layout is a bit awkward and I wasn't sure if I should wait for a hostess or waitress. Eventually I wandered up to the counter that affirmed its all counter ordering which is fine was just a little confusing.   My drinks and meal were quickly delivered and completely delicious. We arrived during happy hour and enjoyed some of the specials. Definitely a place I'd like to revisit",

I came by with a friend around 11 am on a Monday and was surprised to see how crowded it was in terms of parking. Luckily there was ONE spot left when we pulled in!   I ordered the \"chorizo\" tacos with tofu, my friend got the breakfast burrito with eggs, and we split the fried guac. Now first off, the fried guacamole was amazing and I'm slightly addicted/dreaming of when I can go back and get some more! The tacos were pretty tasty and well seasoned and were some of the better tofu tacos that I've had the pleasure of eating. My friend seemed to like the burrito as well so yay there! Outside seating is adorable and definitely the way to go a sunny *aka not volcano burning* day~   So glad to find a vegetarian/vegan friendly place in AZ. Overall a great place to grab some delicious food so I'll definitely be back!",

The cauliflower taco in particular is what my therapist told me to try. Once I got there though, there were soooo many other things I wanted to try. It was a pretty packed house, the only seats available were outside and the high top area near the front.   I went back and forth with a few items on the menu but took the suggestion of my therapist and the lady behind the counter and went with the cauliflower tacos. They were absolutely delicious. I loved the batter they're fried in. I will say, they didn't have much to them though and I've had better vegan cauliflower tacos but they were good!! I plan to visit again and again and try something new every time. I like this place!",

It didn't blow my mind, but I really liked the sauces they used on everything. They were just the right amount of spicy without setting my mouth on fire. I thought the tofu could have used some seasoning/salt. The service, however, did blow me away! They were so nice and accommodating and brought me silverware and drinks even though this is something that you self serve.

With industry standard of maintaining a food cost of under 33% they are saying their food cost are $3 for their chili and cornbread. It's obvious that they are not following industry standards. Why on earth would their be mushrooms in chili. What a major and expensive disappointment",

The first time I visited the establishment was with my girlfriend and a group of friends for their \"Simpsons\" trivia night. We had a large group and the place was packed with a lot of people so the service looked a little flustered, constantly running around trying to figure out where orders were going. The man at the counter didn't know what a whiskey sour was, but his female counterpart made what my girlfriend calls \"THE BEST IN THE WORLD\" I tried the red bean quesadilla that night and really enjoyed it while my girlfriend had the street corn, and we split a hummus platter. I was a little confused by getting a full parsnip, and jalapeno as part of the vegies on the platter (girlfriend doesn't like spicy foods, I love them) but the hummus was good and overall the food and drinks were good. Came back about a month later for another \"Simpsons\" Trivia night and the girl friend and I were alone this time. Again, full kudos to the woman behind the whiskey sour ^_^ The girlfriend constantly gushed over how amazing the vegan pastries are, and I finally got to try the Vegan Poptarts, this one had apple cinnamon and I should have bought more I took one bite and instantly wanted more. Also, got to try the Pistachio sandwich pastry that was so good my girlfriend handed out a piece to a customer just to share how good it was. We ordered the Biscuit and Gravy, and I got the breakfast burrito with tofu instead of egg. It was a amazing night, with more good food and good people.  Today is 3/2/17 and I cant wait to go back, I'm thinking I need breakfast on Saturday there ^_^",

They were cooked perfectly and the sauce in the tacos had a good flavour and really complimented the tacos.   Also not sure why the other reviewer complained about using store-bought tortillas. This isn't some crazy authentic mexican place in the barrio that has homemade everything...not surprised by the tortillas at all. Also had the homemade lemonade and it had a really good flavour and nice tartness. Will totally be going again to try more things. Highly recommended!",

Different sections of limited seating here, including a balcony. Tons of choice here. I came once for dinner and once for breakfast, and everything I ordered was delicious -- special mention to the cauliflower tacos and the breakfast tofu scramble. Prices are reasonable, though the portions aren't that big, so I ended up ordering multiple things which can get the price up, but it's still not bad. It's counter service, and then they bring out your food, which took a while for my breakfast meal; though the service was very friendly. Highly recommended.",

The Coronado house alone has such a nice vibe to it, there are separate rooms you can choose to sit in and plenty of seating arrangements outside. It's really easy to split multiple things on the menu if you can't decide on just one and it's definitely filling. I recommend going during happy hour cause their drinks are awesome. Staff is great, always making good short conversation. I do wish that some of their breakfast items (like their scramble) had a little more to it because of the price but I ain't totally hatin, all around thumbs up.",

Entrance:  we walked around the location trying to figure out the deal...do we seat ourselves?...is their table or counter service...???  I had to find one of the three people working there to find out if we seated ourselves or what.  I was informed \"Oh, this is counter service only.\"  Cool.  I'll find my own seat.  Found a table in the nice warmth of the patio but it was full of the prior customers' rubbish....plates, glasses, food, silverware.  We sat there and looked at the menus, thinking someone would come along to clean off the little table were seated at.  I went in and placed our orders and we just wanted waters.  No offer of glasses so I again had to search for SOMETHING to drink out of.  I apparently snatched the \"pay\" cups, but crap, no help to figure this out!  Oh well.  Back to the table.  The rubbish still there.  So I cleaned everything off and put the stuff in trash and bins.  Obviously there was no post-customer wipe up of the table despite my cleaning it off.  At this point. I'm wondering why in the H**L I left a tip.  I'M DOING ALL THE DAMN WORK.  *sigh*  Moving on.  Food:  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich on FOCACCIA bread but it was served on hard ass sour dough bread that could not be bitten in to because it was so hard.  Also, the veggies were yellow squash and I think butternut.  The veggies were cold and greasy with just the grill marks like it was dragged across the grill.  There was ZERO flavor.  I broke up the sandwich because the bread was so hard and was going to eat it like a salad.  The butternut squash was RAW AND HARD.  Unbelievably hard.  Salt and cholula were the saviors of this ridiculous entree.  It was disappointing.  My husband ordered the FRESH BAKED biscuits and gravy.  I'm not sure if this entree is supposed to be served COLD .  COLDCOLDCOLD.  And congealed.  The biscuits were so hard they \"thunked\" when you tapped them with the fork.  The inside of the biscuits were edible but that was hard satisfying when the gravy was just gross.   We were invisible.  No staff spoke to us, greeted us or thanked us.  And I fricken' tipped!  WTH???  Do yourself a favor and skip right on across the street to GREEN RESTAURANT and NAMI.  You will be thrilled with the service, food, accurate order and did I say service?  No THAT'S worth the tip.    Geez.  I have to go back because I was so confident this would be my awesome vegan dining experience, I bought TWO certificates to this place and I'm not one to waste.  If my next experience improves, I will update this review.  Sad.  Gross and I was still hungry when I left, but I DID clean my table.",

I'd never been, but I love independent coffee houses, so off we went. We enjoyed our food and the atmosphere so much we actually went back the next morning, too. Food takes a little bit of time and portions are reasonably sized, which some may find small compared to the normal American-huge ones you get elsewhere. But everything we had over the course of the two days was delicious. The outside patio is comfy and very dog friendly and staff is accommodating and pleasant. One star reluctantly docked because we found the coffee to be, quite frankly, pretty bad. Would absolutely go back, though!",

    "text": "I like smaller towns and local places. Not that I haven't enjoyed a chain restaurant but there's something homey about local places that I miss living in the larger Phoenix area. Finding The Coronado has really made me feel better about living in this big city. It's charming inside where we ordered and surprisingly quiet on the patio despite there proximity to a busy street. It's close to many downtown attractions. I ordered the cauliflower tacos which were amazing. I loved the crunchy batter on the outside! My friend got the potato tacos and loved the spicy sauce. We shared a plate of fries. I will say, I'm not a ketchup girl. I usually eat my fries straight but I tried there ketchup and I'm not sure what's in it but if they bottled it, I'd buy it! Bonus points for the patio being dog friendly. We both work at a veterinary clinic and brought my friend's dog, Wren, with us. Wren gives 5 paws up for all the love and attention the staff gave her. We will be back! Follow The Coronado on Instagram if you want to see all the amazing food they make!",

It makes meeting up with your non-vegan friends so much easier. They offer coffee, tea and cocktails so there's something to indulge in no matter what time you get there! The food is consistent and always fresh. If you've been hesitant about vegan food this is the place for an incredible first time. The cauliflower tacos are everyone's favorite. They offer several non-vegan dishes with cheese and egg if you're not ready to give it up just yet. Their pastries are decadent and use ingredients like rosemary and lavender making the experience so much more exciting. They are constantly giving back to the community with Coffee For A Cause where one hundred percent of their proceeds go to a local charity.  Acts like this make The Coronado feel less like a restaurant and more like a community. If you can only pick one place to grab a bite, the Coronado is the place to do it.",

The good morning sandwich I ordered was really good, the agave mustard was a nice touch.  One point of suggestion I brought up to the woman behind the counter was the fact that the coronado up charges for non-dairy milk. I found this to be really off putting from a restaurant that is trying to support the vegan community. I told her I would rather pay more for every single coffee drink (as a flat rate like most vegetarian/vegan places) on the menu than be charged extra for being vegan. An extra fee for being vegan is something I'd expect from a restaurant or coffee shop that doesn't understand the vegan culture or community.  Also, wondered where the cow diary is sourced from, not that I eat it, but as a customer who is supporting this restaurant. With a little tweaking The coronado could be a really awesome spot not only for vegetarians but vegans too :)",

Menu is small but great offerings - cheap prices for what you get. Had cauliflower tacos & street corn which was more than enough and very tasty.  Ordered a drink - the Edgemont -- nice light and tasty.  We sat and talked for 2 hours and no one bothered us other than to remove or dishes and ask if there was anything we needed.

They make it a priority to keep their guests happy-- if you try something new and don't like it, they'll be more than happy to fix you up with something new (usually free of cost, at least to my experience).  I recommend the fried guac as an appetizer. It comes on a plate as a decent sized ball of their own guacamole with plenty of chips. The last few times I've eaten here I ordered the avocado sandwich. The pesto in it is amazing! You get an option of coleslaw or fries too; both equally amazing. The coleslaw has apples in it which is a unique and tasty touch. The fries are nice and fat and their ketchup is insanely good with a sweet taste to it. I wanna say they make it themselves bc the consistency is a bit runny compared to others. I've also had the potato tacos, which comes with three filling tacos.  Make sure you try their baked goods!! Usually all vegan and SO SO tasty!! If they've got lemon bars: do it!",

The atmosphere was awesome and had that classic downtown Phoenix vibe in an old converted house, though it was a bit confusing on where to go when I first walked in. The owner and other employees were very nice as well. My boyfriend and I ordered the fried guacamole (on happy hour) and the red potato and gazpacho burger with the brown sugar lemonade. Everything was delicious, including the fries, the house made ketchup, and the other amazing house made sauces. Reasonably priced for fresh, delicious vegan/vegetarian food, and it looked like they had great coffee drinks although we didn't try any. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area again!",

    "text": "This is my new favorite restaurant in Phoenix.   The first time I visited I was a little bit discouraged because I was on a time crunch and ordered 2 cauliflower tacos to go. There was only one order in front of us but our order still took 45 minutes to be prepared! It was infuriating. However, the lovely people behind the counter apologized and said they were very understaffed and refunded our card for our wait time. Very lovely.  So by the time I returned, I was fully prepared for a higher wait time but deemed those delicious tacos well worth it and braved their very busy Friday night. I ordered the same cauliflower tacos with  2local beers and a fried guacamole. I found a seat outside on the welcoming patio and settled in for my wait. 5 minutes later my food was on the table. Bravo! That fried guac? Holy guacamole! Yum! Just the atmosphere, the explosively delicious food and the appropriate pricing makes this place just phenomenal. I was very happy with the improved speed of service and retract my previous apprehension toward the place.  So delicious. So impressive. So happy to have somewhere I can enjoy vegan and vegetarian food that my meat eating boyfriend can also enjoy.  He even said to me that he had no idea now much he could love a vegan restaurant.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants good food, good atmosphere and good people to be around.   The only negative points I have are that, being in a small building downtown, it gets a little crowded inside the there's not enough space for the line to grow when you're waiting to order. I would love to see this place grow and expand and just keep blowing me out of the water.",

    "text": "It is past time for an update.  I have now tried almost every vegan item on their menu. Everything has been delicious and their house-made sauces are to die for!   Their breakfast sandwich and Farmyard Tofu Scramble dishes are great breakfast choices. I like the Biscuits & Gravy, but if you aren't a mushroom fan you may want to avoid because their mushroom gravy contains hella mushrooms.   For lunch, the Potato Tacos, Cauliflower Tacos, and Fried Guacamole are my absolute favorites. So much incredible flavor in all the above, and have I mentioned the sauces??!! (Vegan hack: Omit cheese from the Potato Tacos.)  The Red Bean Quesadilla is delicious, and if you're like me and don't like cheese (even vegan cheese) rest easy, as this quesadilla is queso-free. Yay!   The Red Potato and Garbanzo Bean Burger is very tasty, but vegans must remember that this place is vegetarian, not vegan, and they will NOT ask you/warn you about non-vegan items. The bread for this burger is not vegan, but there is a vegan alternative. Vegans must remember to ask for vegan when ordering, just to be safe.   Last, but not least, the desserts are now ALL vegan, and they are AMAZING! So many delicious concoctions, and all so buttery, sweet and dreamy!  No more drooling in sorrow at yummy-looking non-vegan cakes sitting next to the 1 or 2 vegan options of the day.  I hadn't had Thumbprints in nearly a decade. Their baker makes an unbelievably rich & buttery vegan Thumbprint cookie, filled with various fruit centers.   Muffins, cookies, brownies, scones, pinwheels, pop tarts, and sometimes we're blessed with whole cakes, which always sell out within hours.  It's a great hang out spot too.  Lots of board games to enjoy before or after your meal.  They host special events, like Simpson Trivia nights, too.  This is easily one of my favorite vegan spots for both dine-in and carry out.  They often have Groupon deals.  Opens early, closes late.  Follow them on social media to get info on brunch specials, dessert features, and events.",

Super easy to order and I chose cash as my payment option since I was paying with a Groupon.   I chose 9pm as my pickup time and arrived a few minutes afterwards. The young lady working was very friendly and patient as I pulled up my voucher and my food was packed and ready for me. Super easy to redeem and I got a Mexican hot chocolate cookie, because who can resist fresh baked treats?  I ordered the street corn, which I would pass on for next time. I love corn on the cob but I think the charred aspect wasn't jiving with me. The potato tacos are delicious, love that they come with lime to add some zing to it. And the quesadillas were sweet, savory and spicy all in one, just like I like it.   This is a great place to dine in or carry out, and their menu has lots to choose from!",

Everyone was very accommodating, even the server that wasn't on duty and was just hanging out.     Our table ordered fries and the hummus plate to start.  The fries were hand cut and came with a homemade ketchup that was a little sweet but delicious.  I thought the fries were a real bargain at $3.   The hummus plate was beautiful and full of veggies.  The squash was just lightly grilled and the carrots were served raw.   Micro beet greens garnished the hummus.   Definitely hand crafted and delicious.     I ordered the Goat Cheese & Jalapeno Marmalade Quesadilla made with local goat cheese and  house-made jalapeno marmalade.  I'm going to  make this at home.  Others at our table ordered the jalapeno waffles and Coronado Salad.     The raspberry tea was delicious.  I would have liked to have tried some of their cookies (and cocktails)!

We arrived, and sat on the patio to look over the menu then went inside to order at the bar -easy enough. My friend got the Cauliflower Tacos with the Cypress cocktail and I got the Goat Cheese & Jalapeno Marmalade Quesadilla, Fried Guacamole and the Evergreen cocktail. Unfortunately, our food arrived about 15 minutes before our drinks, which wasn't a huge issue, but it would have been nice to enjoy the drinks a bit before the food. But things happen, they were a bit busy, I get it. The fried guac was fantastic, a bit pricy for what they give you but delicious nonetheless. I even considered ordering a second round! The quesadilla was pretty good too, I wouldn't say it was the best quesadilla I've ever had, but it did the trick. The Evergreen cocktail (Quinta de Gomez, Cointreau, simple syrup, lime, cilantro, Serrano pepper, cucumber and club soda) was extremely refreshing and the Serrano pepper gave it a nice kick-would definitely order again! All-in-all it was an enjoyable experience. The staff was great, the atmosphere was relaxed and casual and I will be back for that guac! I am very interested in their breakfast burrito, it looked delicious!",

First, I tried the chorizo tacos which were hands down extremely comparable to the real thing. I didn't even think twice about having real eggs or beef chorizo. You can tell the cooks take great care to pay attention to details. The grilled corn tortillas added an extra touch. Next up I decided to give a burger a try. The garbanzo, red potato burger will not disappoint you as it provides a well melded combination of perfectly seasoned ingredients that will keep you from ever missing an all beef patty. The dish is served with your choice of French fries or a salad and not just your run of the mills salads an arugula based salad with cherry tomatoes and a balsamic dressing. Each dish I ordered shows the great care taken to provide not only we'll prepared food but, an artistic flare to simple yet wholesome bites that will keep me coming back for more.",

The service is stellar. My spirits always feel lifted after I've eaten there. Usually, I'm a creature of habit when it comes to going out to eat, but I make a point to try something new every time I visit The Coronado and it's always been delicious. The potato tacos are a favorite of mine.  Overall, it's a really dope space that is great for hanging out, grabbing a coffee, studying, or for events and meetings.",

I returned to show my significant other the greatness that is their cauliflower tacos. In addition we tried the goat cheese and jalapeno quesadilla, a little more on the dessert side with the sweetness from jelly they also use. Definitely also loved the vegan horchata made with almond milk. The flavors and the vibe are right I will be returning frequently!",

    "text": "Before I get started on my first dining experience at The Coronado, I will be completely transparent with you - I am not a Vegetarian, nor am I a Vegan. So what am I doing at this type of joint?  Well, short story long - my wife recently gave birth to a beautiful baby girl a few months ago. Yaaaaaaay...us. Well, basically our not-so-little baby would bust out with crazy rashes all over her chubby face and equally chubby body after Dairy Queen feedings (aka Mommy's breastfeeding sessions). Well, it turns out that our daughter is allergic to dairy, so for the first time ever, my wifey needs to avoid anything with dairy in it for the sake of our baby daughter. So we immediately drove to LGO Pizzeria and ordered a cheese pizza.   Siiiiiiike.   When I heard \"dairy-free\" I initially thought my wife would have to just Bugs Bunny it all the way with carrots for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Well, thank God for The Coronado! So many dairy-free/vegan options! And they actually don't taste like sandpaper. (Come to think of it, I've never actually tried sandpaper.)   Numero Uno Tip Time, folks... When you first arrive here, don't sit outside on the nice patio like complete noobsicles, waiting for the servers to take your order...like we did the first time around. You'll be drenched by the misters before anyone comes by your table to write down your order. Instead, get straight outta Noob City and order inside, at the counter, like the rest of The Coronado pros. Afterwards, you can proceed to the patio with your dignity intact.   At the counter I asked the friendly lady what she recommended, and she said \"The jackfruit sliders are good.\" Then I implied no pressure and asked, \"If you could only choose 1 item on the menu what would it be?\" And she quickly and confidently mentioned, \"The cauliflower tacos - hands down.\" At that very moment, the thought of eating cauliflower tacos sounded as joyous as sucking on tree sap for sustenance.   However, when I took that first bite of the misunderstood cauliflower taco, I was happier than a Brony attending his first My Little Pony club meeting. Waaaaaay better than tree sap. For realz. I would order that sucker again. And again. The cauliflower was delightfully covered In crispy (not overtly thick) batter and topped with creamy sauce goodness. The jackfruit burger was also mighty tasty, so I'm happy my wife and I shared the two dishes. If not, I would've jacked her jackfruit burger. Yeah, I went there. (Ahhh...the marriage benefits we take for granted.) We also shared the horchata latte, as well as the delicious, dairy-free Nutella-style pop tart.   As a non-vegan, married to a wife on a brand new non-dairy diet, we cannot wait to go back to this terrific joint to try new vegan dishes and once again - get our cauliflower on. Like tomorrow.",

The place itself is in a converted historic home so it literally has that \"homey\" feel. The best things on the menu (and I've tried nearly everything) are the cauliflower tacos, potato tacos (hold the cheese) and deep fried Guac.  The jackfruit sliders could definitely use some work but otherwise you will be happy dining here! Ask for San Jose salsa for extra flavor and spice.  I only wish that this was the type of restaurant where you are seated and your order is taken at your table because it can get tight at the bar.  Huge plus for long hours everyday from about 6 am to 10 or 11 p.m.!",

The mushroom gravy was to die for earthy peppery nice consistency. But for 10 something a plate I expected a little more bang for my Buck . The gravy was sparing and dish had no sides with it . The avocado toast had this amazing avocado pesto and greens on the side a very tasty flavorful light snack but for nine dollars a plate it also was lacking in portion size one piece of toast and half a cup of mixed greens would cost me 3/4 of the price to duplicate at home. Again for 9 something I expected at least two pieces of toast and a bigger salad.  Now the wait time was ridiculous the ordering process ridiculous. Waited twenty minutes in line ordered at a counter was given a number. Seating was sparse and what was available was family style seating on long picnic tables on the patio. When informing the wait staff about seating issues we were told to ask to share .My daughter proceeded to ask a number of patrons in family style patio seating who were sitting in groups of two or three if they would mind sharing and got shot down several times . We opted to get our order to go and waited thirty more minutes for our food. It was a very aggravating and uncomfortable experience for overpriced food.",

    "text": "A solid 3/5 for my first visit. I will probably try again and see if my next experience is better (or worse). It would be 5/5 if this was a strictly food-based review.  The set-up is.. awkward. Like the whole hip-restaurant-in-a-historical-house theme all over this city is cute, but in this case it's.. jarring. The rooms are small, including the one with the order counter, so when it gets busy it becomes very crowded in there.  I ordered the goat cheese & jalapeno marmalade quesadilla and it was everything I wanted it to be. Very good!   Except I didn't have my drink through the first half of my meal. I had ordered an iced tea. I guess the drinks are made by the cashier, but she was busy trying to serve the line of people that formed in front of her after I ordered. So a guy brought out my food, and I waited a couple minutes.. no sign of tea. I got about half-way through and went back up to the front to ask about my tea. The cashier was apologetic and clearly overwhelmed (I felt kinda bad about it!).   Once your drink is ready, you have to pick it up at the counter (unlike the food, which is brought to you).. this is awkward when there's a huge crowd waiting to order. Not only that, but if I hadn't been very close to the front of the restaurant, I might've had no idea that my drink was ready. I could have waited by the counter, but I had a plate of food. This system works in some places, like Jobot - because their building is basically one big open space. So anyone can hear their drink order be called out and see it on the counter. In this restaurant, it's a lot harder to make it work effectively, because it's a bunch of different rooms.  Again, food was good. I was just kind of weirded out by the way their 'system' works. It seems like it could be done in a way that isn't so inconvenient.  Maybe i'll just use postmates next time..",

The environment was great and the service was good (the only reason I gave them any stars) but the food and coffee were terrible. We ordered the beet burger which was fresh but utterly flavorless; the biscuits and gravy lacked not only spice but just salt and the biscuits were hard and cold; and the chorizo tacos had beautiful presentation but were tiny and again lacking any flavor. Won't be back.",

    "text": "So apparently I am notorious for going to places just before they close, not intentionally by the way. Anyways, I arrived to The Coronado about 30-45 minutes before they closed and I'm never fond of doing that because I have that feeling of the employees being irritated or wanting to rush me. Once again I was proven wrong in a good way!  The restaurant is located right off of 7th street just north past McDowell, close to Nami and Green New American (which are also vegan/vegetarian spots that I love!), so it was really easy to find. I love the look of the building as it looks like it might've been a house at some point in time. It's quite small but I honestly love restaurants like that because it gives it a more homey feel (no pun intended).  I walked in and was instantly greeted by the cashier as she walked to the register. The setting was awesome! Dim lighting in some parts of the (house) and big abstract paintings paintings right when you walk in. It might be a personal preference but I love that coffee shop type atmosphere when I go to a restaurant. The music was chill so it matched the vibe of the place.  Moving along, so I already knew what I wanted to order, originally wanted 2 potato tacos and 1 cauliflower taco, but the cashier told me they can only do 3 taco combo.....I don't think she understood what I meant because I've seen that people have mixed different tacos from other pictures, however, I just brushed it off and got 3 cauliflower tacos without the pepitas (pumpkin seeds).  When I took the first bite..........WHAT IS LIFE!!! The tacos are SO flavorful, I swear I was eating a fish taco, but a much better version that doesn't make me bloated afterwards! The cauliflower was lightly battered and fried and it had guacamole, spinach & creamy avocado dressing. It's literally like a light version of a fish taco, almost could not even tell the difference besides it being slightly sweeter than a fish taco (by now I think you can tell that I love fish tacos). It was pretty late when I went there so unfortunately I couldn't finish all 3 tacos so I'm hoping they will still taste good warmed up. Regardless, it was delicious!  Customer service was great as well. I asked for a to go box after finishing only 1 taco so the cashier I'm guessing assumed that I felt that I needed to hurry and finish before closing time so she assured me that I didn't have to rush and that they will still be there 3 minutes even after closing if I wanted to stay. I thanked her for the offered but told her I was full already so she understood lol.  Needless to say I will definitely come back again and THOROUGHLY enjoy my food next time, and I am hoping to try the Mexican corn and chili guacamole fries, those sounded amazing as well. Stoked to find another great vegan/vegetarian spot!",

    "text": "I was looking forward to this place. They have coffee, pastries, desserts, and food. Most importantly, a great menu for all the vegetarian/vegans out there. Brunch is served on Saturday & Sunday, 10am-2pm. I had the small horchatte, a smooth mixture of the housemade vegan horchata & espresso. The idea of adding espresso into the horchata was surprisingly enjoyable - just a heads up that this is an iced beverage. I also tried the chorizo tacos with eggs, and was sadly disappointed. Basically, it was a corn tortilla with under-seasoned scrambled eggs. The presentation with peppers and onions topping the tacos was appetizing, yet the taste was lacking. It was a bit of a struggle to finish. Maybe opting for the tofu option would have resulted in a different outcome. They were nice enough to accommodate my friend's order of trying a chorizo, potato, and cauliflower taco all in one plate. The potatoes in the taco were undercooked. The cauliflower was on point though. I would recommend the cauliflower if you're going for the tacos. The cookies are delicious!!! I couldn't get enough of that molasses spice white chocolate cookie.   I love that there is the option to sit inside or outside. My friend and I sat outside the patio, and certainly enjoyed catching some sunshine. The walkway around the tables are very narrow. If you're lucky, the couch inside might be available for you to sit. Unfortunately, I was only able to find one plug. This is definitely not a good place to do work for an extended period of time.   They were very fast at making drinks. As I approached the counter, the barista was already making the drink for me. Be prepared to wait 20-30 minutes for your food on a busy day. I was not impressed with the food, but will stop by for their drinks and desserts in the near future.",

    "text": "Vegan. Vegetarian. Say these words and you're sure to get different reactions from different people. Some might swoon, others scoff, but everyone has an opinion about this eating lifestyle.    Me? Well, I try to hate everyone equally, so that said, I tend to be a scoffer...    Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate this lifestyle. Whether it's chosen for health reasons or compassion, I think it can be a noble cause. The problem is that as with all things, there's always a group of people who tend to ruin it for the rest.   You know the ones. They smugly flash their veggie-ism in others faces with an attitude of superiority. Constantly trying to convert others because their way is the \"best\" way...   That said, when the lady-person wanted to check out The Coronado, and I saw it was a Veg restaurant, well obviously I scoffed. Then of course I agreed... because I like food.   The restaurant appears to be a converted home and borders the Historic Coronado neighborhood. I would assume this has something to do with the name. I will not research whether or not that is True.   We went inside and the interior seemed cozy, eclectic and charming. They have a full bar, a small, but diverse local draught beer selection and coffee. You order inside at a counter, get your drink, a number and then they bring the food to your table when its ready.   I didn't expect much from the food. I was really just along for the ride. We got the red potato & garbanzo bean burger with fries, the fried guacamole and the cauliflower tacos.   When everything arrived, the first thing I noticed was that the presentation was well done. The food looked great, but then tasted even better. The fried guacamole slightly edged out the other items as my favorite. The tortilla chips were excellent. They tasted like they were baked rather than fried. They were thick and crisp not like typical thin tortilla chips.   The amount a flavor in all the food was impressive. I didn't expect to be such a fan. If this is what good vegetarian food is like, I could easily eat it on a regular basis.   We also got a couple of baked goods before we left. A cupcake and some kind of a brownie. I've had a vegan cupcake before and was not happy about the experience, but this one was on another level. It had a little kick of spice and was nice and moist. So delicious.  If any vegetarians want some company going around preaching the gospel of veggie-ism, you let me know and I'll join you... at least until I feel like having a steak.",

The patios would be great if it wasn't so hot outside, but it is June in Phoenix.   Had the avocado pesto sandwich with fries and the cauliflower tacos- delicious!   Will definitely visit again!",

    "text": "I love the Coronado neighborhood and the restaurants that line 7th St. I dropped by here for a quick bite on my way to work. This place was once the Coronado Cafe and is now just The Coronado (owned by the same owner that managed Bragg's Factory Diner on Grand Ave). The converted home they operate out of has a lot of history in the area and makes for a nice relaxed dining experience. The Coronado is counter service and they have both indoor and outdoor patio seating. The menu is vegetarian and consists of breakfast, small bites and sandwiches. The counter area serves wine/beer/alcohol and is a full espresso bar. I ordered the Red Potato & Garbanzo Burger and really enjoyed the flavor of the agave mustard they top it with. The street corn was quite delicious as well. The atmosphere was super laid back and they do a great job of creating a nice community feel while you are here. Some people were here for dinner, some on laptops and others playing board games or just having a conversation. My only gripe was that there wasn't a whole lot of pastries to choose from (probably because I came just before closing time).",

    "text": "Like having dinner at a friends house. Very cozy space and eclectic decorations. I will say it was a bit awkward getting seated with menus. We walked in and there was only one bartender around and she was busy helping someone out with a togo order and answering the phone while also making drinks so we finally just grabbed a menu off the bar and seated ourselves. They had a bunch of board games for us to play while we waited, that was a nice touch.  Walked back up to the bar to order since no one else came to us while we were seated, she was super friendly and informative. Great bartender. We got a beer flight and ordered our food and had to grab our own silverware,napkins,and water from a table by the door which was a little awkward having to hold all of that and walk back to your table.  Food came out about 15-20 min later, jackfruit slider and fries were awesome! Just wish they put more jackfruit and less purple cabbage. Biscuiys n gravy needs some work. Gravy tasted like cinnamon and cloves and was more sweet than hearty and savory. Husbands omelet was a little skimpy, he said it was underseasoned and needed a protein in it. The rosemary chocolate chip cookie was so so delicious.  All in all i will be back because i want so bad for vegan restaurants to succeed, being a vegan myself. I just hope they work on their recipes and their restaurant setup so that they are successful and get great reviews.",

It was soo good and had that excellent sauce to go with! The chimi is stuffed with incredible yummy soyrizzo it was just full of flavor!! And of course we had some potatoes on the side! Mimosas $6 which isn't too bad! I was stuffed and for my non vegan man he enjoyed and was stuffed!

You order at the bar and seat yourself as well as get your own waters and silverware. Cute little converted historic home so we liked the atmosphere though it does get very crowded so seats can be hard to find at times.   Food prices were OK, a bit steep but not way out of line. Flavor wise everything was just OK. A few of us got the avocado toast and the toast was pretty burnt and the pesto looked pretty old, very dark. The avocado was tasty and perfectly ripe. Another got the breakfast burrito and we liked it better than the toast. 2 avocado toasts, add 1 egg to each and also 2 drip coffees with reasonable tip and tax came to about $35.    The drip coffee was pretty bad. Very strange sour taste to it, we could hardly drink it. Not quite satisfied with the coffee one of us went and purchased their Horchata w/ espresso and it was delicious, best thing all day. We purchased a scone to go which was pretty dry and not a bunch of flavor.   Overall some things were OK, some not as good and some bad. Staff was friendly but nothing that stood out as great. We may give it another try just in case we caught them on an off day.",

Very unique and the chips and the sauce were fantastic. Best thing of the night was the cauliflower tacos. Just get these when you come here. Great dish. Last but most certainly not least, you have to try the rosemary chocolate chip cookie. This is literally on my top 3 favorite cookies list and I usually don't toss around those words lightly. Incredible.   Very small restaurant so probably not good for a large group unless you can snag a few tables outside. Also, was not impressed with their cocktails. If this place improved their drinks a bit I can see myself coming back here many times.",

You do order your own food art the main counter rather than getting your order taken like at a normal sit down restaurant - but the waitress at the front told us that right up front so it wasn't a big deal at all.   *Disclaimer: I do have food allergies to dairy and soy.* I didn't have any reactions from the food listed below.  My friend and I both ordered the avocado toast. I opted to get mine without the tomatoes and we both thought our orders tasted great! My friend also ordered a hazelnut pastry and thought it a little dry but it was good.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "I have been coming to the Coronado several times a week since it opened.  My favs: potato tacos w/ cilantro lime dressing, the red bean quesadilla, the biscuits and muffins.   This vegetarian cafe-bar continues to be great asset to the Coronado neighborhood. Thanks to its vegetarian fare, political activism, eclectic, old-house trappings, good music variety, and inclusive vibe, the place feels urban, laid-back, and authentic. More than any other restaurant in town, you'll join a diverse group of patrons of all different backgrounds, ages, genders, fashion preferences, with pets, with kids, for parties, meetings, dates, solitude, or just hanging out - all are welcome for any occasion.   The staff is highly professional and proficient - friendly but adept at moving things along (important b/c this place gets packed).   Little thing 1: I do wish that all those working at the front counter were trained to make a proper cappuccino. There is a wide range in results. However, the new espresso machine is quite incredible - you can really taste the difference.  Little thing 2: I would like it if staff would consistently bring cutlery and napkins to tables instead of directing you to get it yourself (some folks will kindly assist, but not everyone). Customers are confused and have to get up and down several times to collect their meal accoutrements, thereby clogging up the main room. I can't imagine it'd take that much extra time, customers would appreciate it and it could \"clear the lanes\" on crowded days.   Good call on putting a water station outside - that's helpful.   And...hands down, you guys have the freakiest bathroom photo collection eveeeer. (I love it!)   See y'all soon. Probably in the next 10 minutes.",

    "text": "First I'm going to plug the Veg-Friendly UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) and say herbivores in Phoenix now have a monthly event in which they can unite!   The Coronado is most definitely a comforting little cottage for everything from light bites, to coffee, to cocktails, to full meals. The pastries are regarding as quality stuff, and like the rest of the menu can be either vegetarian -or- vegan.   Here's what I had:   The Sheridan - Groovy wine and whisky cocktail that went down smooth despite obviously being quite strong. Don't let this combination of alcohols fool you, this is legit.   Goat cheese and jalapeno marmalade quesadiilla - I don't think I could finish an entire helping of this myself, but it's *great* for sharing. Very satisfying even if it is sweeter than anticipated.   Garbanzo and potato burger, with fries: OK, this is the most starchy entree known to man even if it *is* good. My buttermilk bun, an optional component that can be swapped to make this vegan, was good. The burger itself, even slathered with a delicious dijon mustard, just was too...light compared to any other veggie burger I've had. Don't get me wrong it was a good dinner, I just kinda finished it feeling as though I'd gorged myself on snack food. Alas, a plate full of pure carbs is something I did to myself. Coronado merely delivered, but at least it was tasty!   So personally I am not sure I'd rely on this for a dinner spot. But I will say I will most definitely return to sit on the lovely patio with coffee in one hand and a cold, craft one in the other. And no one will complain about dietary restrictions. Pretty cool, right?",

They have good ingredients fresh but no matter what you will never get the same meal here. It will come prepared differently each time. For example Today I ordered avocado toast and what I got was a  slice of bread not toasted with a half of an avocado thrown on top ummm wow for a price of $8.00 I could have gotten 10 acacados and a loaf of bread and made this myself. The problem to me is the employees don't take any pride in what they are doing and cut corners because they don't care.  I think the owner needs to sit down and get everyone on the same page when it comes to how they want their food prepared. I waited to do a review here until I had gone back at least 4 times and ordered the same thing everytime. And everytime myself and my boyfriend have both had the same experience here. No consistency.",

It was a bit too gingery but still good.  The evergreen was too spicy.  The chocolate cherry muffin was good.  They don't have decaf coffee but they do have decaf tea so that was nice.

It's pretty cute how it's in a house but it did feel pretty crammed. Next time if it wasn't so hot I'd sit outside!  It's hard deciding what to order when everything on the menu looks amazing. I thought about going for the potato tacos, a table nearby got them and it looked tasty. I ended up getting the potato garbanzo burger with fries. The sauce on the burger was really good but the patty kinda fell apart. It was delicious though! The fries were incredible as well. I also got to try some of the beet burger which I think I liked even more. The Yale drink was good too! Everything was a tad pricey, but worth it. Only complaint is that the people working there aren't the nicest, but that's ok. They weren't mean just kinda short with me and seemed to be in a bad mood. Otherwise a great experience though!",

Working in the food industry it's certainly a fact if someone is rude your whole experience is ruined or there is a sour taste in your mouth even before you start eating. Every time I'm greeted by someone at the register who's not friendly and looks like they don't want to be there. I get it, but start hiring people with customer service skills or do a more in depth interview because they ruin the whole meal with attitudes :(",

As an ardent Anti-Trump citizen and a lover of vegan deliciousness, this place was just amazing! Thank you for the well-crafted cocktails, perfectly presented vegan tastiness, and for your dedication to politics with integrity. I'm sure as more people realize what a train wreck of a president they elected, they'll be by in droves to support a restaurant with excellent food and the ethics to match.",

We ordered the breakfast burrito with tofu instead of eggs, the biscuits and gravy, and the Tahini Brussels sprout Caesar salad. Our favorite dish was definitely the salad! I ordered the prickly pear iced tea; it came unsweetened and wasn't bitter! We are looking forward to coming back and trying more items on their menu!

Definitely get the fresh squeezed orange juice  We loaded up on sweets for our Grand Canyon trip (rosemary chocolate chip cookies, cookies & cream brownies, lemon scones, cherry pie scones, pecan pie pop tart, & a cinnamon roll pop tart) & they are all scrumptious!",

    "text": "A vegetarian restaurant that hosts Simpsons trivia sounds like something out of my dream journal. Unfortunately, the food needs some work.  My first visit was the best, and the next two went downhill. On my first visit, my dad and I shared the cauliflower tacos and red bean quesadilla. It was happy hour so he got a beer that he loved, and I had a nice prickly pear tequila cocktail. The tacos have been the best thing that I've tried on the menu. They came with a very spicy sauce that my dad and I loved.  The next visit was with my husband during Simpsons trivia. The event was fun although I was a little exasperated that they doubled booked a poetry reading at the same time that delayed our start. My husband enjoyed a couple cocktails, and we ordered the chili fries, jackfruit sliders and chorizo tacos. My husband liked his tacos; I thought the jackfruit sliders were ok but had way too much bun. The chili fries were cold and not that good.  My last visit was during lunch. I decided to take advantage of the all day breakfast and got the biscuits and gravy with an egg. The biscuits were awful. So hard and bland. The mushroom gravy was too sweet, and the whole dish was too cold. I also got a mexican chocolate cookie that I only ate half of. I've made better in my own kitchen.  If I'm in the area, I'll stick with Green.",

I give it three stars because to me the food seemed like it was almost there, but not quite yet. It was pretty mushy in fact. It could have just been the time I have been here, though. I would be willing to try it again. :)",

Now down to the business of the food...Both times that I've been here, the food just blows me away! Everything is so fresh and has some serious flavor! The first time I ordered the cauliflower tacos, and they were so tasty and light, yet filling! This time I got the Tepary Bean burger (Not pictured. Sorry, I was hungry!), and was one is the best vegan burgers that I've ever had! The soft bun, and the one big stewed tomato on top is perfection! I will be back here again and again!",

    "text": "I think this place has a great vibe, and the menu certainly looks good but unfortunately I did not enjoy the food. This may be better for dining in, however i ordered potato tacos and the goat cheese & jalapeno marmalade quesadillas to go. Unfortunately none of it went over well. There were three tacos in the order - there was a lot of sauce on one, and barely any on the other two. The potatoes were really overcooked, dry and salty. The quesadilla was a bit better, but still the jalapeno marmalade was way too sweet without the kick of heat needed to balance it out.  On a more positive note, their bakery treats were nice, I ordered a caramel, rosemary and chocolate chip cookie, along with a blood orange pound cake and both were good.",

    "text": "This restaurant has really, really good food! I'm a vegan who lives about 5 minutes away and would love to frequent this place for their awesome cuisine, BUT I have been there 5 times now and every. single. time. the staff has been unfriendly and downright rude!! They have never once greeted me upon walking in, even though there's always a girl behind the bar deadpan staring at me. \"Are you who I order from?\" I asked the first time, and she sort of huffed back \"uh, yeah..\".   I resorted to sending my boyfriend in for takeout after about 3 horrible service experiences and every time he's gone in, he comes out in a bad mood from how unkindly he was treated from the staff. He went in the other day just for pastries for my birthday, and after being ignored by Ms. Edgy Barkeep as usual, stood by the pastry case for almost 20 minutes as the guy working it chatted up his friends.   The kids that work here ALL have a holier-than-thou chip on their cold shoulders and are hands-down the worst staff of any place I know. They are there because they look the part and not because they have any competency in service whatsoever. I too am in my early twenties and would never dream of treating customers the way they consistently treat me and everyone I've mistakenly recommended the Coronado to. Yes, the food is good, but I won't send in any more friends to be treated like intruders in an exclusive club for employees and their friends. And I will absolutely never give this place my business again.  I've never met the owner/chef but from his food and their Instagram page he seems like a really nice guy. I just sort of get the sense that he has made it a little too comfortable for the front-of-house employees who have been standing around loudly talking to their friends with profane and unprofessional language and doing nothing productive to service each and every time I've been in. It's a cool place to work, I'm sure, but it's still a job and should be treated that way.  I really want to love this place, and would eat their food all the time, but to be met with such hostility isn't even worth spending 2 minutes inside to pick up takeout.",

    "text": "We have mostly loved the food here, but the place is kinda quirky.  Pros:  - Plenty of parking, but enter slowly because there's a huge bump that needs to be regraded in this dirt/rock lot and lower cars may bottom out - Cute interior - Friendly staff (that may or may not be hopped up on espresso so be prepared to be shouted at drill sergeant style when you walk in) - Close to the best vegan baked goods in town (if they have cherry \"pop tarts\" and that's your thing try one) - Creative menu - Nice food presentation (dine-in) - Good for takeout, but know your vegan substitutes and double check them  Cons: - The space IS NOT big enough to do the order at the counter and find a table thing like other places do successfully, so after you order and get your tabletop number stand there may not be a place to sit.  - Due to the above, when you dine-in you may feel rushed because of the groups of people wandering through the tiny rooms trying to gauge how close you are to finishing your meal.  - Service is slow. - Buns aren't vegan and must be substituted out for focaccia or whole grain bread - double check all substitutions, especially with takeout. - They served charred, inedible street corn in a takeout order, which tells us food quality standards aren't a big deal to the kitchen staff - again, double check all orders. - If you get coleslaw on the side with a sandwich for takeout the bottom of your bun/focaccia/whole grain bread will be soggy. - They don't serve decaf espresso drinks for health and environmental reasons, despite there being alternatives.",

It was quaint to say the least.  I sat outside at one of the picnic tables and had a good wait for my breakfast with my wife.  When it arrived though....so tasty.  Possibly the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had.  I tried the \"Good Morning Sandwich\" and it was well worth the wait.  My wife had the chorizo tacos and they were so good, she even shared a bite with me!   I'm a fan of this place for sure.  My only displeasure was with the wait time for our food.

I love the art on the inside and general decor is urban yet modern.   The menu boasts many vegan options. Everything is described throughly and its hard to chose just one dish. The bests are the corn, cauliflower tacos, and definitely the drinks. Brown sugar lemonade, horchata, and chocolate soda with organic vodka. All delicious!  The parking lot is small but its not that big of an issue. I would definitely visit again.",
