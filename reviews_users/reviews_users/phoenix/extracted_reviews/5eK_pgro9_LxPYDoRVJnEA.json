Good quality and the price is what you'd expect for nearby downtown restaurant. The place is small but has a wonderful outdoor patio option and the menu doesn't have too much to chose from but the options they do offer are pretty delish! Cute little coffee station you can pick up your coffee from. I had the espresso.. the coffee quality was ok. A bit sour for my taste but overall not bad.",

This place is nice for a college student or two people in a hurry. The food was okay but nothing off the charts! The coffee is put in thermal pumps you get yourself I was not too jazzed up about that  being that I seen a review for top 10 Phoenix breakfast spots. The cashier guy was a little snooty when I asked a question stated its right there pick two of those choices. The manager did come buy ask if it was okay, but who wants to complain when your trying to visit with old friends. The staff was nice who delivered our order. I ordered the chorizo benidict which looked good but they left all the grease on my plate! Will not be back!",

Just drip coffee. I will move this to 5 stars... If you do pour over coffee :)   Breakfast was great- Mexican Benedict: poached egg over chorizo and a corn cake. Delicious!!!

I went with 2 friends- I got the Johnny Cakes which were phenomenal, and a huge portion too. It came with 2 sausage links and fresh strawberries on top, a side of the most incredible homemade rice pudding I've ever tasted, with syrup on the side. Soooo good! My friends got the Pain Perdu and the French toast. I love how they do the cold drip coffee as well and U can see the drip system up on the wall.   The line moved quick (you order at the register and then they give you a number and you wait at a table). Also they do not permit you to hold a table while your party goes up and orders and that's something they enforce. You choose your table only after ordering. They bring the food out to you. Service was great as well. Will definitely be back!!!!",

Inside has a nice, relaxing ambiance to it. Again, it wasn't crowded when we went, but I can imagine it may not be as relaxing if it got really busy inside. I must also say that the restroom was really nice, which is always a plus.  The service was fine. Nothing to complain about there.  The food was good. The menu is small, but at the same time has a good selection to choose from if that makes sense. We had the johnnycakes with turkey sausage and the blackstone scramble with flour tortilla. The johnnycakes were really good. Love that corn in them. The sweet rice was also a great side with that. The turkey sausage was a little dry, but had a nice spice to it. The scramble was solid. The pork shoulder was cooked nicely and was a perfect size for the scramble. The prices were also very reasonable for the portions.  Overall, good spot to grab some breakfast/brunch. Reasonable prices, solid food, generous portions.",

    "text": "Me and my husband went on a Saturday morning around 930ish AM and it was little busy. From outside, it is a pretty small place, walking in one can smell the wonderful aromas coming from the restaurant, they have small outdoor seating here, not good for summer months with the way temperature has been, there is no mist or fans out there. Upon entering the restaurant, there is a sign to take the menu and order and manager will seat you. We ordered the special for that day, which was Steak Rancheros. My husband loved the special, for me not so much. The salsa on the steak was very good. Their coffee was great. Their servers were really good and polite. The man at the register was very impatient and just wanted to be done and move on to next person. We told him that this was our first time coming, what do you recommend, he did not have anything to say. So we asked him again, what do you think about the special? he said- \"it's good!\". That is how we made our choice, we did not want to hold the line. My husband ordered Orange juice, which is nothing spectacular, it has the taste of a regular grocery store juice. I ordered waffle as extra and it was okay. When it came, it looked like it was already sitting for a while. I have posted the same pics with and without flash. They do not have much sitting area inside, their high tables and chairs are very uncomfortable to sit in. I am not sure what all the hype is about, or may we just ended up coming on the wrong day. I have no desire to go out of my way to visit this place again.",

I was expecting the server to offer a comparable price for the 3 coffees since the restaurant made an excuse about the \"pitchers not being delivered\" but I guess my expectations were too high. This left a bitter taste in my mouth (not in the good coffee way), and there's also no refill. Since I run on caffeine, there just wasn't enough there to wake me up.   Strike 2 - I ordered the blackstone scramble, and the eggs tasted absolutely bland. I'm always looking for a kick in my breakfast to help me wake up (sensing a theme here?)...it just didn't hit that note for me despite the delicious description on the menu.  I should not need to drown my food in tabasco for flavor.   Strike 3 - I can see the ordering system working to improve efficiency, but in this case, since there were no designated waiters, there was no motivation to assist/clean tables. I didn't see many patrons leaving tip, and this just creates a no win situation on both sides.  And I'm out",

It sounds weird (I mean a pork chop on a waffle with an egg?) but it will change your life. For the better. And their infused coffee, delish. Or if plain ole joe is more up your alley, they have bottomless cups of freshly brewed local beans. Also, they use Schrieners sausage. Nuff said. Oh and the people there are awesome! Super nice, welcoming, make you feel like a regular even if it's your first time!   In summation, go to Vovomeena. You will thank me.",

The food and atmosphere is definately in with the hipster crowd right down to the 19th century hair cuts some of the staff was sportin'.    They do not serve alcohol but they had a coffee and tea bar for those looking for caffiene fix.    The only downfall was that it was very crowded and hard to find a seat.  When you did find a seat you had individuals standing around either looking for their seat, the menu, or in line to order.  However if their only downfall is that they are too busy then I guess they are doing something right!  Will definately be back!",

    "text": "The menu is honest and clear: no substitutions. That being said, I couldn't help it. My heart wanted the one omelette option on the menu to be a chorizo omelette instead of a potato omelette. When I asked for the change, the portly hipster behind the counter gave me that look. The one that says, \"dude, we're so popular right now we don't have to give you anything.\"  He told me they aren't able to change a thing. I ordered the waffle, bacon, and potoatoes, with a side of scrambled eggs. The waffle wasn't my favorite kind (I prefer one that's crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside). This waffle was just soft, like a pancake. The eggs were typical. Not fluffy air goodness, like I always hope eggs will be. Bacon was limp and fatty.  Sometimes I feel like a breakfast spot like this gets its high ratings mostly because it tries very hard to be unique and trendy, less than because the food is actually delicious. But I'll be honest: I've never craved a pork chop in my breakfast, and this place isn't changing my mind on that front.   If you're wanting pancakes and the like (basically dessert) then you're going to love their options here. But c'mon, you could go to a million hip places in the valley that offer a carb-rich, sugar filled pancake and be thrilled. The real posers of breakfast are revealed in how they do the non-carb options. Sorry Vovomeena. For me, you're nothing more than a hipster poser. Great coffee though.",

First, the pros:  - Clean setting. - Great vibe. - Lots of people. - Friendly staff. - Great looking pics on Yelp.  Based on all the pics on Yelp, I decided to order the Mexican benedict. The chorizo sold me. When it arrived, I started to indulge in the dish and thought to myself that, \"this isn't as good as I was hoping.\" No big deal... I still liked the place and the vibe. The reviews were good and when I'm back in the area, I'll try something else. I'm not one to want to waste food so I finished my plate and started to go about my day. Again, no big deal.    As soon as I got into the parking lot, I started to feel weird. Maybe a little gassy... that happens, right? I just burped it along as my buddy and I were headed to play a round of golf. I'm still a little gassy on the first hole (not even an hour after eating). Then it hits me on the third hole. Not to be too graphic, but it was coming out of both ends and all I can taste coming up was the chorizo.  It's been a few days and my tummy is still a little unsettling from this meal.  I'm not writing this to tell you not to go there because clearly people have enjoyed their experiences but I will be very hard pressed to give this place another shot.",

The pocket has a good flavor mix with the cheese and sausage and it's more than filling.  The Mexican Benedict had great texture to the muffin on the bottom, good balance to the chorizo, and a sauce that complemented everything.  Overall both dishes have a lot of flavor without overwhelming you and it gave me the impression that I'd like most things on their menu.  Clean place, friendly staff, and at that time of day they are the only shop open so parking isn't a problem.  They have a nice patio and access to ice water refills.  They server soda in cans which is a bummer but that's just my OCD.  Good place for families, singles, pretty much people of all ages.",

Shortly the manager (?) came out and apologized for the mistake, said my order would be out in less than a minute, and handed me cash for what I'd paid for the meal saying he wanted to make it right. An apology would have been sufficient. He went the extra mile to give me a refund.   My breakfast was great, as usual, and I was very impressed with the way they quickly remedied their mistake.

The Mexican Benedict was absolutely delicious with the chorizo on top of the sopes and the potatoes were well seasoned and fluffy. Definitely a must try breakfast item of theirs! I can now understand why it is one of their most popular dishes. I loved the idea of a cold brew sampler in order to try the different flavors they offered. All three flavors I tried: the Black and Tan, peppermint mocha, and orange peel ginger were some of the most flavorful cold brews I've had.   I cannot wait to visit Vovomeena again and try the other breakfast items on their menu! It is a must for breakfast in Phoenix!",

    "text": "This spot got our morning off to a GREAT start! You grab a menu and look at it while in line, but the options are so many you won't know when you get to the register. Thanks to all of the great yelp photos, the winner of my \"tournament of decision\" was the Mexican Benedict.  From there, I was able to step to the side to order an iced mocha before sitting down wherever we wanted. I think this is a great wrinkle because the food comes out quick and seats for most in line are available, like clock work. NO one was standing around waiting for a seat even though the line was to the door when w got there.  The Mexican Benedict was amazing, with a spicy chorizo along with the usual. I found myself savoring every bite, and the flavor was consistent.   The manager was warm and informative to everyone eating, and we felt so enjoyable while we ate good food. Such a smooth and pleasant time before the day had turned epic.   This is a great place to fuel up with good quality food and brunch energy!   Well done, Phoenix!!",

I was a little annoyed at first for having to wait in line to order, but once I got the menu, I was thankful for the extra time to decide what I wanted (I needed it).   b.m.o.c.: honestly, I don't even like pork or pork chops, but this sounded worthwhile and I'm really glad I went with it. the porkchop was delicious af and went super well with the waffle and poached eggs. It was kind of like an eggs benedict but with a better quality meat and carb substitute. They could probably top it with hollandaise and make it work tbh. I want it again...and again...  orchard french toast: challah? a million times yes. and the grated apple? actually might be the best french toast dish I've ever had. I'm surprised I finished 80% of both of these plates tbh. I was full the rest of the day.  cold brew flight: I learned afterwards you can actually pick which coffee options you want, which I wish I had known beforehand. everything I got was still good but also all kind of tasted more or less the same. I wish I could go back already and try the other options!  my favorite thing about this place was actually the decor. everything is super cute and photo-worthy. I love the signage and the coffee lab wall art. even the framed art prints in the bathroom were adorable.   congrats on winning brunch.",

The food was good. We ordered the 3 sisters omelette and the Johnny cakes. Johnny cakes tasted like cornbread and it was pretty good all around except for the rice. Not much of a horchata person and that's what it reminded me of. The omelette was perfect, no complaints there. Coffee was great! There was a cute coffee bar inside. Had little jars with sugar cubes, loved it. It almost made me add one to my coffee and I don't even put sugar in my coffee! I will recommend this place. Thanks again.",

The owner/manager maybe came to me and asked if I'd been in before, gave me a menu and said to order at the counter when I was ready. I waited for my friend and we ordered our plates along with orange juice.  Food came out fairly quick and everything looked fresh and good. I got the Wilcox Avenue breakfast, which included two eggs, spuds, biscuit and choice of meat (which I declined). I also got a Portuguese donut which came with jam and was tasty. I enjoyed my meal and it was filling and affordable. My friend got the Pawtucket West and her two pancakes were ginormous. She also liked her choices and the juice was refreshing. Definitely recommend this spot, great service as well.",

The parking was difficult to find, but there was plenty of parking once I figured it out. I was looking forward to trying a flight of their Japanese Cold Brew but unfortunately the guy who normally does it wasn't working that day. Instead, I tried an iced coffee. It was very good with the right balance of sweet and strong. To eat, I ordered the biscuits & gravy -  buttermilk biscuits, white sausage gravy, and two eggs on top. My husband ordered the Mexican Benedict - poached eggs, chorizo, hollandaise sauce on an English muffin with fried potatoes. After ordering and paying inside, we sat outside on the cute patio. Our food was delivered rather quickly. My biscuits and gravy dish was very good. The sausage gravy was very flavorful and the biscuits were very fluffy and tender. My husband's dish was also very tasty - the chorizo being the star of the plate. Overall, everything we tried was very good and would recommend others to try as well. Their pain perdu - a bread pudding French toast - looks and sounds delicious. I'll definitely be back to try a few other items.",

The two times I went, the person I was with got the b.m.o.c. and I end up eating almost half of it. So good. The perfect dish for a salty sweet craving. The pork chop is more or less a thick piece of ham and the smokey flavor and brine soaks into the waffle. Amazing. The pain perdu is good too but it is all sweet and I do prefer a savory flavor. This last time I had the Johnnycakes which were good but once the b.m.o.c was placed on the other side of the table, I completely forgot about them. They did have fresh corn and a mild Chile flavor. They cut easily but trying to fork them to your mouth was ridiculous. They fell apart really easily. The prickly pear syrup was good and mildly sweet. I love Vovomeena!",

    "text": "Had brunch with a co-worker here today. Food was delicious and flavorful. Excellent for brunch. Mexican Egg Benedict was phenomenal! Their espresso machine was broken but the Japanese Cold Brews were nice and strong. You get to add your own sugars and creamers to your taste at the bar area.  We told the barista it was our first time dining there and he gave us a quick tour and break down of the restaurant. So, you grab a menu and when you're ready, place your order at the register. If you order coffee or tea you pick it up at the bar. You get to pick your own seats and they'll bring your food out to you.  Although quaint, the place has a very unique look; comfortable but sophisticated. There's also a patio sitting area if you chose to sit outdoors. The employees were kind and helpful when we asked about their recommendations. They were also attentive in offering/providing condiments/extras and clearing our table.   Definitely going back, definitely a new favorite!",

So I was thankful for my two sistas from other mistas for joining me for brunch.  This place is super cute and absolutely delish! I ordered the Mexican Benedict.  Sopes instead of bread...chorizo, cilantro and a lovely poached egg with hollandaise sauce! Served with their spuds...I added their arugula salad and dropped that on top of the benedict...perfection!    This place is great! I know we will be back and I'll definitely have the banana bread pudding french toast my friend got...that ish was off the chain!",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time based on the good reviews and enjoying Tuck Shop, however this was a pretty epic fail   We arrive at the restaurant and were told by the barista how the menu and ordering works, and we placed our order of the mandatory BMOC and the grillades, and supplemented that with a Coconut Macaroon (not the French hard shell style) that looked good at the counter. We ordered hot green tea and a cappa  The macaroon was mainly coconut with very little cake to it, which was fun for a bit or two, then was one note and disappointing...which was a common theme  The tea came in a regular bag (which was a little bit disappointing for a place that touts their coffee, you would think tea would be more than an afterthought, and then the cappa - which ended up being an espresso covering in foam in a full sized coffee mug. It was clear the barista had no idea what they were doing, I am sure there is a name for espresso doted with foam but it was not in the right cup nor was it what I ordered - that was disappointing. They seem to specialized in cold brew and had 5 or 6 of them going, so maybe that is all they are good at, it certainly isn't making a milk based coffee drink  The food looked good upon coming out however and the first bite of the BMOC was pretty good, the waffle with syrup and apples was done properly and the pork chop was a good piece of meat, the egg was cooked well. The issue was that it was unbalanced when the components were eaten seperatly and one note when eaten together. The pork chop was salty and a bit oversmoked, so for a bite or two it was great, then it was boring.  The grillades was pretty poor all the way around, the biscuit's were not very good and the meat was simple pressed ground beef and it was overly salty, the gravy was not that appealing, a pretty poor rif on traditional biscuit's and gravy  about 1/3rd of the way through the meal we decided we were wasting calories and it was time to go  If you want a great waffle and pork chop - Matt's Big Breakfast is pretty amazing upon comparison - I had wanted to try this place to give it a comparison, and it really makes Matt's stand out, simplicity done well is very hard and they do it there, not so much at Vovomeena",

We had the BMOC - this was supposed to have a \"massive smoked pork chop\"  but really it was a thick piece of brined pork that was over brined: too salty and had the texture of lunch meat.  We were excited to try the famous portuguese donut, too bad it tasted greasy like cold fried fair food.  Ugh.  The best part of the breakfast was the savory crepe.  It was tender and cooked perfectly.  The chicken and scrambled egg filling was a bit flat though.  I did order it without the fontina cheese, perhaps that was supposed to carry the dish?  Each ingredient should stand on its own, and they didn't.    There are way too many other places that have GREAT breakfasts.  Try Melrose Kitchen on 7th Ave/Indian School instead. chilaquiles, huevos rancheros, and bottomless flavored lemonades.  Breakfast for two closer to $20.",

    "text": "Now this is breakfast! Just landed in Phoenix and my family and me were so hungry. Peanuts on the plane are cool, but I need some substance. And substance did I get. Looked to my trusty Yelpers for a place near the hotel and this was the first place to come up. Didn't even bother to look at the menu, Siri, tell me where to go.   When we arrived, we had to park in a tiny lot, where cars circle in hopes for a spot to open. Luckily, someone was leaving as we were coming. Inside is super cute with seating inside and shaded seating outside. Here you grab a menu, order, then seat yourself. Menus are on the wall, we had a time finding them. Everything had a name that I'm not used to reading. On a whim, I ordered Johnnycakes, which was 2 corn & chile cakes, sweet rice, syrup, and potatoes.  No egg and no meat, the guy put extra potatoes. Ok, sir, you're cool and already know me!  My family placed their orders and we all waited patiently. All the plates came out relatively close to one another and we dug in. Now, looking from the outside, you would not guess at all what you were about to bite into, but it was a pleasant surprise. It was literally corn & chile! With the syrup and sweet rice it was just too delicious. The cakes were a good size, too. And there were strawberries on top. My. Goodness. I couldn't stop. Then to the potatoes ,which were perfectly crispy some bites. I was in breakfast heaven, and I'm not a big fan unless is basic. But this blew all the other breakfasts out of the orange juice! My family really enjoyed theirs too as their plates were empty. I couldn't finish all of mine, I think the extra spuds got me, since I finished those.",

This restaurant has a personal take on breakfast standards, my favorite was the eggs benedict served on sopes. Biscuits and gravy were generous and hearty. The portuguese donuts have a daunting amount of sugar on them but it's actually just the right amount to survive a 105 afternoon in Phoenix.  The care they take with each dish is obvious and appreciated.",

I've never seen turkey sausage that looked like that. All in all, though, a good choice.",

I really appreciated how their menu was not huge. I like places that pick a few things and do them well. That certainly turned out to be the case. The Mexican Benedict was absolutely delicious. What fantastic texture and flavor!  The coffee is excellent and the environment is charming and warm. Seating was a little tight but I found a spot before my food was ready. It was a little too cold and wet for a patio spot that day, but the patio does offer additional seating for the other 99% of Arizona's weather.  Parking can also be a challenge because the one lot serves many different businesses in the same complex. Arrive early and be ready to circle the lot a few times, or park off site and walk off some of those calories ahead of time.  I'll definitely be stopping by Vovomeena again, and recommending it to my friends!",

He was a bit apprehensive to take \"little sister's advice\" on where to go eat, but I know he liked it -- even though he won't tell me so. Lol.  My brother and I were both wanting a breakfast burrito, but since it was a Saturday, we had to choose something else (they only serve the breakfast burrito during the week). I opted for The Banging Pocket (mostly because that's what the guy at the counter recommended) and my brother got the Tortilla Espanola. I also ordered a latte, my brother ordered the cold brew. Now I'm not much of a fan of cold brew typically, but theirs is amazing! They infuse the cold brew with different flavors so it mixes it up a bit; it's not your normal cold brew, I can promise you that!   Since it was a beautiful Saturday morning and not too hot out, we sat outside sipping our coffee while the food was prepared. It didn't take long for the food to come out though, which was surprising considering they were busy (thanks for being awesome kitchen staff!) The Banging Pocket was, well quite bangin' -- extremely flavorful with the mix of scrambled eggs, Schreiner's banger sausage and smoked gouda (my fave!), with a side of roasted potatoes on the side. Definitely hit the spot with me. My brother devoured the Tortilla Espanola, and said it was amazing (the clean plate would've told me that, though, hehe).   I loved the atmosphere, the food, and the absolutely kind and informative staff at Vovomeena. I just wish it wasn't so far from me. I will definitely drive out here again soon though. It's so worth it!",

When I have time to meet up with friends, it's always for breakfast and we need another location to give us a break from Snooze. I agree with a previous post about the lack of signage for those using Google Maps. We pulled into the parking lot feeling a bit confused. Once we found the restaurant enterance around the corner, my husband went up to order for all 6 of us as to not crowd the cashier, and the kids and I found a table that a previous group had just left. As we were walking toward it, the manager abruptly told us that we couldn't seat ourselves and had to wait to order first. I explained that my husband just did as he was walking over with the number but that didn't change his condescending demeanor. He had us step aside while he cleaned and separated the tables into 2-tops again. After asking us how many, he then went right back over to the tables and put them right back to the same configuration. Really????  Other than this negative, unwelcoming  manager who gave no response to any \"thank-yous\", the food was great and the coffee bar was as well. I'm not sure how, or why this person has a managerial position but I hope he one day finds happiness elsewhere. We all deserve that.  Update: I received an email from the manager after this post which in itself, was impressive. It's always a good indication that they care about the business and the customers it serves. Perhaps my interpretation was unfair. Like i said, the food was great and that's what really matters to me so I'll definitely be back.",

It was my first visit and the guy at the register (possibly the owner? manager?) pointed out at least 4 dishes that were either totally gluten free or could be adjusted. I went with the Mexican Benedict and I was pleasantly surprised with how crunchy the sopes turned out to be. The chorizo was delicious and the poached eggs were perfect. The potatoes could have had some crunch and/or seasoning, but... obviously not a deal breaker since I still cleaned my plate.   The possible owner/manager also walked by and asked each table about their meal. I know a lot of places do that, but it seemed really genuine here.  I know they have fancy coffee here, but I just got a regular ol' cup. Loved that they had raw sugar cubes. I'll be back for sure!",

They have seating inside and a patio connected to the restaurant and then a shared patio (Chipotle, salad place and a poke place in the same space) with extra seating.  I ordered the johnnycakes that came with crispy potatoes and a small side of sweet rice pudding along with a watermelon infused tea. The cakes were a mix of sweet/salty as they've got tiny pieces of corn and chile in them but strawberries on top and maple syrup to pour over if you'd like. I'm used to small, chunky cakes but these were HUGE! I couldn't even finish all of the food I received so a total bang for your buck!  The guys who run the space were great, super service focus and in an area with so many choices, I'd make this mine again and again!",

Space is very narrow Have to get your own coffee  Overall, I recommend this place for a brunch. Easier if it's a small group since seating can be a little more competitive than what I would like it to be.

It's banana bread pudding french toast covered in a whiskey caramel sauce and bananas. This is the stuff dreams are made of. Additionally, there's hardly ever a wait.

    "text": "This new breakfast/brunch place from the Tuck Shop owners is the lone gem in a row of typical chain restaurants at the SE corner of McDowell and 7th Avenue. By coincidence, I ended up eating here three Sundays in a row. So, I've been able to sample a variety of entrees from their menu--which isn't all your typical eggs and bacon. That's a good thing in this case. My favorite so far is their Tortilla Espanola_ the perfect texture and combination of potato and egg with a brava sauce. They also offer Portuguese donuts. They are OK. They are like funnel cakes but seem to be made from a lot more egg. The set-up is pretty in and out. You look at the menu and line up to place your order. If you order a beverage, you move over to the coffee bar after paying for your order.   Besides the scrumptious menu, I love the decor. They have space on the patio and a bike rack. Inside, there are floor-to-ceiling ropes smartly placed between people dining and people lining up to make their orders. I also like the hanging shelves of glass bottles behind the coffee bar. The brick and industrial materials gives the place a modern and simple feel.  I recommend getting there before 11 a.m. That's about when it starts getting pretty crowded. There is no signage out front so it's easy to miss. Parking is accessible on 7th Avenue, just south of McDowell.",

    "text": "I've eaten here once; I got their food to go once; and I walked out without eating once. My first visit was odd. I ordered the staff recommended Mexican eggs Benedict. The plate was way overpowered buy the taste of chili. Chili for breakfast is not appealing nor tasty.         For the takeout \"I went back to give them a second chance\" I ordered scrambled eggs, sausage, and tators. It was good.           Then came my final visit. I arrived on a weekend with four family members including my wife. When we came in my wife sat at a table while I went up to order (it's weird but you order at a counter NO servers here). While I was waiting to order a manager or staff member went over to my wife and told her that she \"couldn't squat at tables, that the tables turn over fast and that she could only sit down after ordering\". Odd right? My wife got up feeling unconformable, told me what happened and we left.          To be honest their food isn't that good. I just wanted desperately to find a breakfast place to go to regularly. Phoenix is missing good breakfast places.",

    "text": "Had breakfast here this morning, and while there are still some kinks to be worked out, it was overall a very pleasant way to start the day. I had already stopped in a few times since they opened for coffee on the way to work, so I already knew the staff is friendly and courteous. This was confirmed today when, on their first really busy Sunday, the kitchen was backed up and the wait for food was long (we waited over 30 minutes for ours to come out, and even then it came out in waves).   Both our server and the (owner? manager?) made a point to stop at our table and thank us for our patience as they experienced their first busy weekend. Hey, I don't mind waiting too much if it's obviously something the management is aware of and trying to fix. I'm sure it will be smoother next time.   The food was excellent and lives up to the standards expected from the folks at Tuck Shop. We went with the boxty, two donuts, sauteed potatoes, a pancake (1 is very large and fluffy), and an egg/cheese omelet.   Critiques: 1)The menu specifically states \"no substitutions\" for breakfasts. However, I was told when I ordered that if I didn't want a side of meat, they would deduct the charge for it. So apparently, they are not as inflexible as they seem, but I wish I had known that while I was frantically trying to compose a breakfast that didn't include meat.   2)Because of the above-mentioned \"rule\", the logical solution is to order from the (small) a la carte section at the bottom, which is what my husband did. It would be nice if they would ask if you want everything to come out on the same plate rather than trying to fit a separate plate for 1 pancake, potatoes, 1 omelette, and donuts on the table when it was really all one meal. We ended up doing it ourselves at the table and handing 3 empty plates back to the server.   3)Order the donuts. If you like things that are amazing, then don't miss these. OK, that wasn't a critique. I just couldn't wait to mention these little puffs of funnel-cake heaven.  4)Hey! Vovomeena! There are a lot of vegetarians in the world, and we want to give you money to make our food. We're not asking you to change your world-view or anything, but just a little acknowledgement that not everyone wants a \"choice of meat\" on every single menu item. You guys are pretty light on the fruit and vegetable side of things, and no, fried potatoes don't count. And how about some other options besides cheese in the omelette? Please?   5)If you are an inflexible vegan, there is absolutely nothing you can eat here. Except maybe the potatoes, but I bet they're sauteed in butter. You can, however, enjoy a tasty soy latte and pout while your friends enjoy their food. But then again, you're vegan; you're used to this. (sigh)  I will eat here again. I promise to add a star next time if either the wait time or the non-meat options are improved...I will even think about adding TWO stars if both of those requests are heeded.",

Oh, and a pork chop. There's a lot going on.  I wish that they were a bit more flexible with the menu. They're very clear about no substitutions, which they're doing in an attempt to ramp up the \"fast service\" style that they're aiming for, but it rules out a few menu options for me I'd otherwise be really excited to try, and that's a bit of a bummer.  The service was really good the first time we went. The second time, we had a hiccup where my meal had gotten lost in the ether, so I didn't get to eat until after my entire party was pretty well done with their food. But mistakes occasionally happen, so no real love lost.  Overall, it's pretty damn tasty, and a fun experience. And TONS of food. Worth swinging by.",

The menu is also unique and a refreshing change from the typical breakfast fare offered at most other places. The ambiance is modern, and comfortable.

    "text": "Had brunch there today with my husband and daughter.  Would they come back?  Most definitely not.  Would I come back?  Maybe, in a year or two assuming they stay in business.    Would I encourage people to try this place?  Yes, but on a leisurely day, and not when you want to impress or be impressed.     The space is pleasant: ample outside seating, high ceilings, narrow hall running east west with plenty of light coming in from both ends.  They have a limited but ample menu with items that conceptually sound delicious.  (You know, like Tuck and Astor House.)  After more than 40 minutes of waiting, we had: 1.  boxty (grated apple & potato pancakes, honey mascarpone, choice of meat).  The grated apple is not cooked into the pancakes but put on top.  Honey mascarpone was sickeningly sweet, and pancakes were peppery -- weird combination.  I picked sausage as my meat choice but it wasn't served with my boxty.  I asked the server \"Was I supposed to get sausage with my boxty?\"  She responded, \"I don't know, were you?\"   I showed her the menu and the sausages were brought out shortly; but response was borderline rude and at best it showed she didn't know the menu which had 12 items on it.    2.  johnnycakes (corn and chiles, stack of three, sweet rice & fruit, choice of meat).  This might have been the best item from the three that we ordered.  The pancakes were beautifully browned; like fluffy cornbread.  But something was missing to tie the flavors of the pancakes, sausage, sweet rice & fruit together.  Maybe syrup?  Maybe a butter chile sauce?  But the sweet rice needs to go.  3.  piperrada (fry up of pork shoulder, green & red peppers, tomato, onion, two eggs on top).  The number one ingredient in the entree description was barely there.  Hubby did the rude thing of picking his food apart right after it came, maybe because he was not happy that his first two picks (grillades and mexican benedict) were not available.  Table manners aside, when he removed the two eggs from the top of the pile, the underneath was mostly red and green peppers and onions.  If you pieced together the pork shoulder pieces like a jigsaw puzzle, it might have ended up being the size of a small bacon strip.  Tomatoes were also missing.  Two separate people asked if everything was going ok and my hubby told both of them that he was not happy about the pork shoulder.  But nothing was offered, no substitution, no refund, nada.    I don't remember the last time my husband complained in a restaurant.   That is usually my gig, and even I don't often do it.  Today I had a feeling any complaints would fall on deaf ears. We had to wait quite a while for a food and during that time  I saw several customers going to the counter making non-positive gesticulations and being met with a response that I could lip read as \"So sorry.\"  I also saw four very frustrated cooks who spent quite a bit of time looking at the ticket items while very little food was coming out of the kitchen.    We felt bad for everyone:  the cooks, the owners, the patrons, and us.  Such a downer for a brunch.   From our table, I ate the most food in hopes of eventually understanding the concept from each dish.  (If it matters, I wear size 0 pants and am not prone to just eating anything and everything.)   In the end, while my daughter looked at me in disdain, I told her I just needed the calories to make up for the effort in getting there, for the wait, and for the money spent.  Supporting local businesses is a must, but it shouldn't be painful. I think Vovomeena could be good someday if it works out its kinks.  But I'll wait a long while before I risk another downer of a brunch again.",

    "text": "See the blog for more:  With Aileen and I arriving nearly simultaneously we entered the crisp new space only to be greeted at the front seating area by a pair of baristas standing before the Japanese Cold Brew contraptions and with everyone bright and smiling we were invited to take a seat anywhere we like, eventually settling on a four-top in front of the open kitchen.  Greeted next by our server, a delightful young woman named Hedda, and then by the restaurant's manager it was explained to us that the method of operation was to grab a menu and then order at the counter while coffee is done self-serve and with that in mind we perused the menu and the restaurant's interior before making our selections.  With the space largely empty at such an early hour (but later to fill to capacity as I sat studying till 9:30) we both admired the cozy industrial/shabby chic interior and with The Shins and Minus the Bear amongst the morning soundtrack the restaurant was lively but not loud, though a small group on the outdoor patio seemed to be having quite a good (boisterous) time.  Chatting as we waited it would not be long before the food arrived and purported to have overordered I personally thought everything looked just right when our table was filled - particularly as I sipped on my third cup of the Vovomeena's bold and intensely earthy brew.  Taking notes from various culinary traditions including the Deep South, England, Ireland, Portugal, and more our meal started with a simple buttermilk biscuit topped with salted butter and paired with a side of strawberry rhubarb jam.  With a light crisp to the exterior while the interior crumb was moist and rife with lightly sour notes I partook in the top half of the biscuit while my friend enjoyed the bottom and although good on its own the addition of the jam was definitely more my style.  Moving next to the one dish I'd probably not have ordered if I were visiting on my own, the \"Banging Pocket\" with Shreiner's Banger, Scrambled eggs, and smoked gouda wrapped in a pita was actually quite good, though largely due to the use of quality ingredients more than anything particularly done with them as the pocket of pillowy bread featured a nice balance of fluffy eggs, spicy sausage, and just enough cheese to make it 'stick.'  Neglecting the \"griddled spuds\" on the side largely because I found them a bit too greasy I will note they were quite tender and well complimented by the salt, pepper, and onions.  Noting my propensity for sweet over savory at breakfast it was not until Hedda described the \"Boxty\" that we decided to order it and while it too was just a bit greasy the overall effect of the hot and crisp potatoes juxtaposed against the sour shredded apple and creamy but sweet mascarpone was quite nice.  A sort of sweet meets savory hash brown served with choice of meat I personally would have preferred to see the bacon, also Schreiner's, more thoroughly cooked but that is just a matter of personal preference as the quality of the meat was quite impressive either way.  For the next choice - the most expensive on the menu with good reason - the B.M.O.C. would prove every bit as good as its description would have you to believe.  Beginning at its base with a crispy waffle lightly tinged with vanilla notes and plenty of butter then subsequently topped with apples cooked down in maple syrup, a smoked pork chop, two poached eggs, and finally a crunchy Portuguese donut it would be hard to call this plate anything but gluttonous...or delicious.  In a dish where any number of elements could have shined, what truly set this dish apart for me was actually the chop - a smoky and savory slab of meat that was easily cut with a butter knife and fork and nicely matched by the intense sweetness of the rest of the plate.  Better than the famous \"chop and chick\" at Matt's and less expensive (without the line) this will, and should, become the restaurant's signature in my opinion.  Moving last to the \"dessert for breakfast\" item that had originally drawn me into Vovomeena the day the menu was first published, the pain perdu was simply exceptional.  Featuring dense banana bread rendered into a custard style bread pudding and subsequently sliced to be fried up on the grill this was everything I want from bread pudding - crisp and caramelized on the exterior, soft and dense within, and topped with bold \"whiskey caramel\" sauce plus ripe bananas that push the dish ever-so-close to \"too sweet\" while still keeping things in check, particularly when matched with the Schriener's Sausage.  At $6.95 you'd be hard pressed to find a better breakfast dish in town and having sampled my fair share of bread puddings I'd put this iteration in my top ten.",

I'll tell you what, the name implies Portuguese food but having grown up on it, this is the farthest thing from it and a huge disappointment!   Obviously the people who have given it a high rating have never experienced a GREAT Portuguese breakfast and have been fooled into thinking a luke warm grease drenched not fully cooked lump of batter is a donut or treat in the traditional style of cooking..... NOT!!!  I asked the server if they have Linguica which is a traditional Portuguese sausage and he said he thought they had it once but no..... I'm not sure he knew what I was talking about. ..... Vovo-no-idea!   We all commented on one common denominator of each of our pretty tasteless orders....... The eggs!!!   Real or Powdered (reconstituted) ..... either way, just not very good.

I expected what I read, \"Pork Shoulder\" and seriously folks, it paled in comparison to a Denny's Denver omelet..... it was a very strange thin finely chopped ham colored meat.... very odd.  I do not see this restaurant lasting.......  This is Phoenix and what we have come to know about eating out there is that, \"If it is going to make it, it has to be consistently good\"  There are sooo many restaurants there and sooo much competition amongst them that this place is not going to last.  The seating is horrible not to mention Stupid.....  I get the first come first serve thing but we were told to just hold on and not get excited because we would get a great seat...... It never happened and we were three people assigned to a two person table that we couldn't get all the plates on and on the patio between two doors causing us to be brushed up against by every server and patron........    The inside has a neat trendy look and feel but I need more than that in order to appreciate it as an actual eating establishment.  Oh, the coffee was good...... I'll up it a star!  Forgettable!",

We did talk with the manager and their food was comp'ed, so that redeemed the situation slightly.  I was also unimpressed with their selection.  Every menu should have something vegan or something that can be made vegan to accommodate those who choose to not consume animal products.  I see two other reviewers highlighted this as an issue.    I'm giving it two stars instead of one because the coffee was good and they had almond milk and stevia for it...although there was no counterspace to make your coffee (for those of us not getting something fancier than just a cup o' joe).",

First, my food order was made wrong, so I boxed it to take home (several hundred miles away) and they literally went all out to make it right, but I had to leave to start my journey home. Back home, family enjoyed the chicken fijata pita. So I would say, it would be a good food to take home.   Second, wow, the customer service is amazing. Everyone was super nice and accommodating. I would totally visit here again.  Lastly, this place made my Phoenix trip worth it. I would recommend this place for breakfast and to try out, because they have the most awesome customer service I have seen.   So give it a try and judge for yourself.   Happy breakfasting.",

The food was good, a bit eccentric, but different and fun. I wasn't a big fan of the mocha but my mom liked her coffee. The beans were roasted in Cave Creek. You grab a menu when you come in and then jump in line and place your order and then pay at the counter then find a table and they bring you your food and take your dishes away when you are finished. It's very well run. I had the biscuits and gravy and my mom had the Mexican eggs Benedict. I'm from Chicago and only like Chicago style sausage, so I wasn't a big fan of the sausage in either, but it's a chorizo so it's different.  Those two meals and the coffee and mocha plus two orange juices was $40, so a bit pricey, but good.  It filled us both up.",

With an open kitchen cooking up a storm and a barista counter for your coffee.  You need to order at in a line and pick your seating after.  I was looking at the menu; very traditional american breakfast, but with funky modern twist.  I went for the b.m.o.c, Waffles with a pork chop atop and apple maple syrup and finished with an over easy egg with a side of Portuguese donut.  It was sweet and savory at the same time while the oozy egg gave it a smooth texture to every bite.    Service overall was welcoming and quick.  I didn't get a chance to order and coffee, but definitely and next time for me and Bo Bites recommendation! - Enjoy!",

Make sure you try the potatoes and mango iced tea. I was on vacation from Minnesota and we went here for breakfast every single day (4 days in a row). The manager even noticed we were frequent customers and wrote us a coupon for 1/2 off our next meals. I wish I could bring this restaurant back home with me!! If I could rate over 5 stars I would.",

Comes atop a beautifully made waffle and apple compote, with two eggs (made your way. Mine were a perfect over medium) on top.  They chose a quasi-fast casual dining model, so you pay first and receive your order via server. Ambience is great for foodies, like myself, who enjoy taking photos of everything, and the service was very responsive, efficient and cordial.",

The parking here though is a bit hard to find - you may end up needing to park next door. I had to park in Zoe's kitchen because parking lot was full.   I ordered the tortilla espanola with the sausage. The food arrived pretty fast! The tortilla espanola was interesting - first time having it. It had a soft spongy texture - looked like savory cake! The sausage was good, and the salad that came with it was a little greasy for me. Not sure what they put on it but overall the entire dish was good.   Definitely recommend for brunch in youre in the area!",

You can browse through it, but you don't place your order until you get to the cashier and then your party is seated. If you place any coffee orders, you pick it up at a separate counter to the left of the cash register. My party of 6 were immediately seated and coffee was promptly made. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating with our larger party. Our food took less than 20min and was brought out to our table. Food ranged from an omelette, to a breakfast sandwich, and a tortilla espanola. Overall, food was good maybe lacked just slight seasoning on the tortilla espanola, and the additional Portuguese donuts were delicious. The venue itself is pretty awesome and I highly recommend checking out!",

It makes for a quick dining experience.  When we arrived, there were menus really to pick up and ordering was at the counter.  We received our drinks first and a number so they could bring our food to our table.  The food was simple, hearty, healthy, and good.  I had their breakfast crepe and it came with a side of arugula salad in a vinaigrette dressing.  I had some potatoes from my friend's dish and they were so good.  One side of the potato wedge was crisped and it was like eating a hearty French fry.  They even have Japanese drip cold brew.  We were in and out within 30 minutes and plenty of time to explore the city after.",

Consistency for years and years of us coming here, I took a photo on IG in May of 2013 and since then they've only improved!   If you want a party in your mouth, dine here.  If you're timid on trying new things, don't dine here.  They specialize in dishes you won't see anywhere else and the menu proves that!  I highly recommend VOvomeena if you are ready to take breakfast up a notch!",

It was still plenty of food and really good.  The coffee??? Let me just say, wow! Right up my alley. Strong, robust and Very smooth. I'm not sure what brand, but super good. Didn't make my stomach nauseous as some do.  I assume the owner, or one of them, was going table to table checking on things. Very accommodating. Nice touch.

You put in your order at the counter, walk over to the coffee bar if you got a coffee drink, and then sit down with your number and wait for your food to come out.   I was in a super french toast mood so I went with the orchard french toast and of course got a side of the spuds. I also grabbed a japanese cold brew because come on, you can't pass up on coffee. Now in terms of the food, the french toast was deeelicious. Sweet without being too overwhelming and definitely a good portion for the price. Man the spuds were so good, they almost overshadowed the main dish! They were really well seasoned and tasted great by themselves and with hot sauce! The japanese cold brew didn't really meet my expectations, but I'll probably try out a different coffee drink when I'm there next time.   Service was great and the food was delicious so I can definitely see myself dropping by again!",

I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quick bite and some caffeine in a clean, quiet environment.",

Vovomeena has no pretenses.  Pick a menu, order at the counter/cashier, get a number and wait.  If you don't know the drill you might feel a bit lost at first.   The small outdoors dining area is quaint and shared with other businesses.  The morning dine time was quiet and peaceful.   Ordered the Johnny Cakes.  These are 2 large corn 'pancakes'.  Fresh corn and green chiles are dotted throughout, with strawberries on top.  Crispy on the outside, moist and flavorful inside.  A definite recommendation.  These are served with sweet rice and a choice of bacon and sausage.  The sausage had a good bite with plenty of texture.  Nice. The rice seemed like an afterthought, but was tasty nonetheless.   Overall a good dining experience and recommended for a delicious meal.",

    "text": "My friend wanted to take me to breakfast and when she mentioned the place I was thrilled to try it out, being from out of town and judging by the reviews it was worth the try.  The interior was beautiful. I absolutely loved the decor, it was simple and clean. Even the bathroom was designed well. You order your food first and then seat yourself at a table. Beware of large brunch crowds.   The food alone was wonderful. The meals were perfection and prepared with the slightest simple yet effective touch. What really drew me to the place was the flight of cold brew, what a genius idea!! We ordered a mexican benedict and a BOMC. The benedict was exactly what I expected, its presentation was great and the chorizo definitely gave off it's mexican flavor. The BOMC was spectacular. The portion is enough for two and easily one of my favorite dishes, even though I haven't tried anything else.....it was just that good. The pork chop was tender and wasn't too seasoned so the pork flavor alone was enlightening. The waffle was a perfect sweetness and my eggs were as good as scrambled eggs can be. The portuguese donut it was paired with was cute, light and powdered with sugar. I didn't have much of it because I was already extremely full from the dish, which was bittersweet. I had a iced latte with vanilla and it was great, smooth and sweet. We also had the flight which will get you to that coffee high. I can't remember the names of the brews but the jalapeno one was interesting, though wouldn't be my first choice.  I would recommend the restaurant to any breakfast or coffee aficionado. If I'm ever in the area again I would love to stop by. I hope to try some of their other establishments if ever the opportunity arose.",

The flow for counter service is a little confusing on the first visit, but on our most-recent trip, the guy at the coffee bar was doing a great job directing traffic and explaining the process to the first-timers with confused expressions. The breakfast sausage is the best around; it tastes like it's cooked in the rendered fat from a slow-roasted pork shoulder--layer upon layer of porky deliciousness that gets Vovomeena a fifth star.",

Truly a stellar coffee product that is created with care and precision that you can taste. It's as artful as it is delicious.   I knew it was more than I could eat, but I had to order the b.m.o.c., which is a waffle topped with a pork chop and eggs. This dish is also garnished with a Portuguese donut. My husband ordered the savory crepes, which were topped with a red pepper sauce that replaces ketchup in my book.   Truly satisfying, tasty and the service was top-notch despite the order-at-the-counter-and-pick-a-seat setup.",

I'm SUPER glad we tried it, as we'll probably be back this coming weekend. The menu is very simple, straight forward and to the point. they have close to 10 different menu items, a mix of omelettes, meats and breakfast dishes. I went with the Biscuits and Gravy with over easy eggs and a Vanilla latte. Wifey had this omellette with feta and a ton of veggies. My daughter went with the kids pancake and eggs, HUGE pancake that was easily enough for her to share with her daddy haha The sausage gravy was the perfect consistency, and the biscuits were done just right. Wifey LOVED her omelette as well. Teh coffee was also done just perfect. All in all, just a great meal at a cool little spot. we'll for sure be back!",

Fantastic selection of very interesting and well done breakfast dishes, and wonderful Japanese style cold brewed iced coffee.   They have a dog friendly patio around the back, where the waitstaff bring our dogs water in dog bowls without even asking for it.   Even more impressive is the service. We were there today (Sunday) and the place was very busy. My wife ordered her favorite, apple and potato boxty. Some time after we ordered, but before we got served, they ran out of boxty. Kai, the manager, came over and offered her anything else on the menu. And then he did something I had only heard about from my parents, about how fine restaurants used to be run. He comped BOTH our meals in apology for running out of my wife's favorite. I thought this kind of service had gone the way of the dodo. I was blown away.",

Two of us had a BMOC and a pain perdu.  It was a nice combo, hearty, savory, sweet.  The BMOC's tender waffle is a counterpoint to all of the other goodness that smothers it while the smoked pork chop is in small pieces to make the eating easier.  Pain perdu is a luscious excuse to eat bread pudding for a meal!  Ask for the syrups and sauces on the side so that you can customize your sugar rush.  The ginger morning moonshine was good, but I'll probably pass on the next trip and there will be another visit in the plans soon.",

Whenever I go to a new spot, especially one with such great reviews, I'm eager to talk to the staff about their favorite dishes and drinks. When I approached them with my typical excitement and list of menu questions, they showed minimal interest and had dull responses. I even asked for recommendations and the cashier wasn't very enthusiastic about any of the items really. A Portuguese donut sounded interesting so I asked how they were and I was told they are, \"just eh.\" Wow! I couldn't even believe it but I didn't order one because of it.   As a coffee addict I was pretty excited about the cold brew flight - but disappointed with all three flavors. They just weren't for me :( I'm not one to complain but I asked if I could just have a hot coffee instead. What was nice was one of the waitstaff refunded me the difference in price, even though I didn't ask to be. Even still, he just sort of awkwardly walked up to my table, handed me cash, mumbled that it was for the difference in price, and walked away. Not sure if I just caught the restaurant on an odd day or something but my entire service experience was just really was strange.   Both my friend's meal and my own tasted just okay. Nothing special about it. Pretty bummed because I was excited to find a new, cool brunch spot. On to the next one!",

    "text": "We went for breakfast on Sunday morning, and managed to beat the rush. The decor is fun, albeit totally hipster. There's a great little patio which you'll totally find me on, once the weather isn't so damn miserable. The menu is small, but mighty, and there are oodles of things we want to go back to try.   Now, I realise that I'm one of the few less-than-four-star reviews, but I have good reason! I would have given this place 5 stars, had it not been for two things that made me knock off a couple stars.   But first, let me start with the really good stuff: the food. In general. We got the Johnnycakes and the Mexican Benedict to share. The star was the johnnycakes. They sounded interesting, but neither of us were prepared for the incredible flavours. The cakes themselves are actually pretty savory, with whole kernels of corn, and green chilis. They've got texture, and a little bit of a kick, and by themselves are so good. Pair them with arroz con leche, strawberries, and syrup, and you've got a flavour combination that is enough to wake up any pallette! I made sure to get some of the cake (with syrup), some of the arroz con leche, and a strawberry on to my fork... wow. Just wow. Green chilis and maple syrup are not a combination I would have imagined being tasty, but damn! The savory with the sweet was just the right balance. And the bacon it came with was thick-cut and damn good.   The Mexican Benedict was pretty great, too. The chorizo was the real deal! But, here's where I took off a star... the eggs were overcooked. You can't have eggs benedict with overcooked eggs. The yolks weren't runny, which is the best part! Solid yolks were a total disappointment. I had to take a star off. I was so looking forward to runny yolks, mixed in with the chorizo. The potatoes also contributed to my removing a star or two... they were just blah. Nothing special. Not a lot of flavour. Compared to the flavour of the johnnycakes and the chorizo, I expected something a little more interesting, even if they are \"just potatoes\". Not a lot of seasoning, and I think they may have been cooked with onions, only one small sliver of onion made it on to my plate with the potatoes. Boo.   The other reason I took off a star: the coffee. They're all about their Japanese cold brew stuff. My lady friend LOVES cold brew coffee, and ordered a coffee float, with vanilla bean gelato. Mind you, the cold brew was one of the main reasons we went there. Sadly, her coffee was so bitter it was practically undrinkable. I'm not a fan of coffee, but even I could tell it was way more bitter than it should have been, when I tasted it. So that was extremely disappointing.   We'll be back, and I may give the benedict another go, but this time if the eggs are overcooked, I'll be sending it back. Yes, I'll be that dude. Same with the coffee. I'd love to see them do something to amp up the eggs, especially since the rest of their food has so much going for it. It's sad to see the potatoes fall flat. We are excited to try the other things on the menu... it's just a shame that the things we were most looking forward to fell kind of flat.   But those johhnycakes though!!!",

    "text": "Phoenix is literally littered with restaurants.  With a pizza places opening up on every bloody corner saturating the market with tomato sauce and charred crusts, to concept restaurants taking over the world, there seems to be a new \"hang out\" brewery or up and coming hot spot on every corner.  I have been coming to Phoenix now for 6 years back and forth and have tried a multitude of the culinary prowess here in the land of cactus and hipsters mixed with pretentious yoga moms who talk incessantly about their new diets and fired trainers.  It seems unlikely that the boom is ever going to end.  Frankly its a bit daunting and pretty stinkin hard to keep up with them all opening and closing.  But......it is good to know that there are a few places that seem to never loose their food edge.  I apparently stumbled on one today.  Vovomeena is a quaint, ugh...what a stupid word quaint, little gem of of 7th Ave and McDowell tucked behind some of the more annoying chain spots that surround it.  You have to get a menu first and decide what you want before you sit down, which I think is brilliant as it only makes me want to punch the jerk faces in the nostrils when they walk into a small spot with their whole family and their stupid dog in a bag and plop down just to \"save\" their seat.  You people deserve to wait.  You are no more important than the people who are going along with the restaurants rules and regs to keep the flow.    Once you decide off their beautifully minimal menu of about 12 or so items you make you way to the counter, order, grab your number and THEN sit down.  The service is also minimal.  I happen to like that.  They take your order, bring you your food and leave you the hell alone.  They ask if you need anything else and go away.  You are left to get your own coffee and water, which is right around the corner basically from anywhere you are sitting, unless on the patio.  Again I like that.  It cuts down on all the hoopla and stupid speak which, truthfully, unless you are obsessed with yourself, you don't really want to talk about anyway ESPECIALLY AT BREAKFAST!!  I drank to much last night and I want food, good food and coffee and some bloody peace and quiet, so thank you staff.  Not to say they lack anything as they will hop right to if you do, but you are pretty much left to fend.  I ordered the waffle and pork chop with poached eggs and a perfectly crisp beignet plopped right on top.  Whoa doggy it was delicious, every last bite, because I destroyed it like fat kid at Christmas.  I wanted to high five the cooks but they were busy so I gave a verbal \"brilliant\" to the one who was eyeballing me to see if I liked his food.  Seriously people this place is really quality.  My normal haunt is Matt's Big Breakfast or Dicks Hideaway but I have officially got a new fave in the valley.  Thank you FOH Staff and Kitchen of Vovomeena, I will be back to try the rest of the menu and bring my appetite for more of you yummy goodness.  Cheers.",

We generally have a rule that when visiting a new city, we don't eat at the same place twice...but rules were made to be broken!  We had the b.m.o.c., the Mexican Benedict and the banger pocket. The b.m.o.c. Pork chop was moist and tender, the waffle light and crisp and the accompanying prickly pear syrup was a perfect finish. The Mexican Benedict was equally delicious with flavorful chorizo, perfectly poached eggs and a very good hollandaise to top it off, all on a crisp sope. The banger pocket was good and a hearty portion. Of the three is wasn't our favorite, but if we were hung over it probably would have been!  Get a jug of Morning Moonshine and a cream cheese muffin if you need something before your meal arrives, which on this morning our food arrived quickly and hot.  The staff was also attentive, friendly and engaging. If you are in Phoenix, this is a must eat stop.",

    "text": "Vovomeena having amazing breakfast and was the best breakfast that I have in my vacation to Tuscon, Phoenix & Sedona.  My parents normally have a traditional chinese breakfast and they love the food here too.  The  pain perdu - a bread pudding French toast - looks and tasted delicious as posted by many Yelpers and I agree.  I also order the Mexican Benedict and was really good.  I really wanted to swing back again before my trip was over but unfortunately I was not able to make it.  The sausages was good meat.  Ordering  & Seating can get confusing for newbie : So here is a recap (please click helpful)   1) There is a front (Bigger parking lot) & back entrances (smaller parking lot - you see the coffee barrister & the restroom if you enter thru here - go to front to order.). 2) Don't get a seat ,  you have to \"ORDER FIRST\" before you get seated ( The ordering is near the front entrance ) 3) After you order and paid you get a NUMBER. 4) You take that NUMBER and get on another line by the wall  across from the coffee barrister This is where the manager will find seats for you. 5) The process seem to be okay as I was able to get at seat 10 mins after I order and paid. 6) After I got seated , I probably got my food in another 8-10 mins.     For the great food, I feel okay for this process.",

I figured it would be busy, but it seems that they have an efficient system for seating guests after they've placed their orders. The breakfast was delicious and hopefully we'll get a chance to go back again soon!",

The sweet rice was like a breakfast rice & raisins dish and meshed perfectly with the savory cakes.

Aside from that minor, brief disappointment, the meal was filling and good.    One of my friends got a french toast dish... totally sweet and delicious... and probably best as a dessert.  Another friend got the mexican benedict dish which was quite flavorful.    The flight of coffee samplers were interesting... especially the lemon/jalepeno coffee.

Topped with two eggs sunny side up, it was the perfect combination of savory and sweet. I was pleasantly surprised that the pork chop was smoked,  which really made it pop! On the side was a warm Portuguese donut, which is like a fritter, only less dense and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Although very oily, it was sweet and delicious. The coffee was excellent, roasted locally in Cave Creek.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was modern and traditional fused together. It's small, but well lit, and family friendly. I was intrigued by the walk up format and the tiny front kitchen. It is a wonder that they work so efficiently and quickly there. The service was fast and friendly. The prices were good, nothing more than $12, and the majority of the small menu breakfast entrees were $8-9. A great value.  I do believe I've found my new favorite breakfast diner!",

The restaurant was bustling with smiling people enjoying their meals. I tried the pawtucket west: two LARGE fluffy and yummy tasting pancakes with choice of meat, (I had bacon) and skillet potatoes. My hubby had the BMOC: which was beautifully done and tasty: waffle, pork chop, eggs and a freshly made donut on top. I had this coffee, they seem to specialize in, and it was really good, really. Sometimes we have to give places another chance, I'm glad I did for Vovomeena. (Random: the decor everywhere is well done and intriguing, even in the restroom. hahaha).",

I would call this counter service, you order at the register than take your table.  After that your food is brought to you and everything else is just like a regular restaurant.  The menu is made up of the normal breakfast and brunch items and then the other items are things that you normally wouldn't think of but of boy, did they sure look and smell good when they went by us.  Our party had the famous biscuits and gravy -YUMMY; Blackstone Scramble - YUMMY and then the Banging Pocket - YUMMY!!  Next time I'm getting the Pain Perdu because it looked and smelled so good.  The service is top notch and everything was very clean.  They have indoor and outdoor seating available and dogs are welcomed on the patio. I would highly recommend Vovomeena for breakfast/brunch.",

You grab a menu prior to being seated, get in line to order with the cashier. Once you pay, you'll be given a number, then you can sit at a table.  I had the pancakes, with sausage and two eggs. Delicious!! The syrup is so tasty. You serve your own coffee but juice can be grabbed right before paying. No servers to wait on you, they just bring out your food and you aren't bothered again. It's a bit loud due to poor acoustics and folks chattering. I do not recommend bringing kids, more of an adult restaurant.",

It catches your eye when you see a line out the door!    As you go to order, food is being prepared right in front of you.   I ordered what people talk about, the Pain Perdu.  The thing that stuck out for me was the Whiskey caramel sauce!  It covers the banana bread pudding french toast and is accompanied with two thick slices of bacon.  It is topped with slices of fresh banana.    Some very comforting dishes if you are in the mood for something sweet or down right tasty they have it all.  Also ordered was the mexican benedict.  It was made with deliciously poached eggs, having a mix chorizo, tomato, onion, it had memorable flavor.   Reasonable breakfast prices with tasty selections.",

And this place had some awesome reviews on Yelp, and it did not disappoint!  I ordered the egg and bacon sandwich on a croissant with home fries and my husband ordered the biscuits and gravy. We both ordered a coffee each. After ordering you food/drink at the register, the coffee station is was located next to the register with hot coffee (decaf as well) and they also featured a Japanese cold brewing area, which was very interesting to watch against the coffee bar wall.  After ordering, everything is self serve. Also for any coffee snubs, they also offering lump sugar, either raw or white. As well as, various milks for your coffee. Also have a water area with cups.  Our meal was so delicious, just want we wanted! The vibe was laid back and the atmosphere was hip. They also had outdoor seating. Next time, I'd love to try the pain perdu.",

    "text": "I left a review for this place and saved it in draft mode after having a unpleasant experience here last year. The service was bad and the food just wasn't good. After taking my mom to Matt's during her visit here, I told her about this place since I had heard so many good things about it.  I ordered the B.M.O.C., my son had the biscuit & gravy & the pain perdu and my mom had the Pawtucket West, none of us were pleased, my eggs arrived cold and when I asked that it be placed in the microwave to warm up a helper stated \"we don't have a microwave here\" and walked off....needless to say I was refunded my money back for my meal while my mother & son opted to deal with what they had and not complain.  I originally came home and wrote a yelp review to which I was contacted by the owner and offered the opportunity to come back and have breakfast on him in an attempt to change my perception of this place. I agreed, and THOUGHT I saved my review in draft mode for an update of the original review in addition to the new one, but apparently I did not because it's gone. Anywho, although my firm is located less than a mile from here and my son attends the art school across the street, I have never felt the need to come back for that comp meal.   So I guess it's safe to just leave my 2 stars (which is only 2 because of the owner) and keep it moving. I will state that although the helper guy was extremely rude, the owner was very nice and accommodating and did everything in his power to appease me.",

This place didn't disappoint.   I really liked the food here. I wouldn't eat here often because most of the food was on the heavier side, but it was really good. If you want pancakes, this place has really good ones.  They also have freshly squeezed orange juice.   The food came out fairly quickly.   Definitely go here for good breakfast.",

The tortilla was over cooked and bland, and was definitely not Spanish as suggested in the menu.   Vovomeena is also not for folks expecting decent customer service. If you're a disabled woman asking for a glass of water, then don't be surprised if you're asked to head to the water cooler and help yourself - \"I don't bring water to the customers. Customers do it themselves\"   Overall, extremely disappointed and would recommend to stay away!",

They could stand to figure out their seating situation. The seating is organized like a Carl Jr's (ordering food, get a number, then sit). This causes table chaos, because people come in, scope out a spot, then a representative from the table places the order. I call shenanigans, because my wife and I had to order than wait, then literally run to the first available table.   As we finished up, the line grew out the door, and I felt bad for the poor suckers who were going to give Vovomeena their cash, then have to stand and wait for a table to open up.   We were sure to let the manager know this problem, but not sure what's in store for their future.",

I also sampled stale biscuits and gravy. Honestly, KFC has better biscuits. Maybe it was just an off day.   I DID enjoy the outdoor patio and order-at-the-counter/seat yourself nature of the place.

We had heard awesome things and boy, it did not disappoint! We had a flight of 3 different kinds - lemon jalapeno, med, and ginger cardamom. They were all delicious. The first one you could really taste the lemon, not so much the jalapeno, the med was nice and bold, and the ginger cardamom was my FAV. Nice and spicy.  Note: cold brew has MORE caffeine in it!  For food we got the BMOC and the Pain Perdu. Both were excellent. The pork on the BMOC was nice and moist and smoky. The Portuguese donut was fluffy and not too sweet. Pain Perdu is just SINFUL. Banana bread pudding French toast with whiskey caramel sauce?! Oh you must. You'll gain 5 lbs but you just have to do it.  My only gripe is that both dishes were swimming in sauce. It was too much. My waffle was soggy on the BMOC because it was drowning in syrup. And it whiskey caramel sauce is so rich, they could really just drizzle it on there and it would suffice. Next time I will order the syrup and sauce on the side! I suggest you do the same.  Overall, really good experience. Customer service was warm and friendly. Mostly hipster crowd but there were families there too so we felt totally comfortable as well. Will return!",

    "text": "My hubby and I have a standing ritual of having Sunday brunch together.  This week we decided to go to the independent standout, on what I call \"chain restaurant row\" on 7th Ave and McDowell.   And for those who live in South Phoenix/Laveen area, like we do, the trip took us an easy 15 minute drive in Sunday traffic to downtown.  If you are going for Sunday breakfast, being an early riser has it's advantages.  I recommend going between the hours of 8:30 and 10:30 am.  We arrived at 10:15am and witnessed  the place fill up quickly at 10:30am.  We entered the restaurant from the 7th Ave parking lot.  Vovomeena's has an entrance via the patio.   When you enter from the patio, it's a bit confusing orientation.  To the right you will see the kitchen and that's where you start by grabbing a menu off the wall, stand in line, and place/pay your order at the cashier.  They will give you a number and the server brings the food to the table when ready.   I recommend looking over the menu online prior to your visit, because frankly, I imagine this process to be backed up when the place is crowded by the newbies trying to decide what they want to eat -- there isn't much space to move, so the pressure is on.  I noted there were quite a few family with kids.  While my husband and I have a son, we were on a \"date brunch\" so we chose to sit AWAY from the families :)    I do imagine the patio - during nice whether - to be a perfect spot to have a family breakfast so don't be afraid to bring them along.  But let's get to the food!   Vovomeena's serves up such creative concoctions <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vovomeena.com%2Fmenu.html&s=681a7ac23afc6437a334db13bdd472c5fc31de03c3d3600d588a49ad45dd971b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">vovomeena.com/menu.html</a>  I enjoyed the \"Johnnycakes\", described  on the menu as two chile corn hotcakes, prickly pear maple syrup, served with a side of  sweet rice, and choice of meat.   Layman translation:  sweet corn tamale (with chile) pancakes, rice pudding, and either bacon or schreiner sausage.   I loved my meal - but was not a fan of the prickly pear maple syrup (so much that my husband was reminded of a scene from the Tom Hanks movie \"Big\" when he chews and spits out his food.)  On our next visit, I look forward to trying the \"Mexican Benedict\" , poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, served on sopes.   This is the kind of interesting culinary twists you can expect to see on the menu.  There is plenty on the menu to keep me entertained and no negative experience to be critical of.     Check it out!",

And talk about the menu! Johnnycakes oh my! Corn and chili pancakes with prickly pear maple syrup- what?!!! DELICIOUS! And the coffee from Morning Moonshine, a roaster I'll admit I'd never heard of before but am SO glad I've discovered! That's coming from a Portland, Oregon food capital foodie but thank goodness my mom lives in Phoenix and I can count on visiting Vovomeena each time I'm in town.

At this restaurant, you order first, and then you wait in another line for the manager to seat you. It is not self-seating. Also, I liked how there is an open space by the kitchen for you to see the chief and line cooks. The cooks work so hard; I wish I could just tip them personally.  Favorite Banding pocket - Schreiner's banger, 2 scrambled eggs, smoked gouda in pita bread with spuds.",

I tried: Mexican Benedict, three sisters omelet, savory crepes, orchard French toast, and the chicken and waffles. Everything had it own distinct flavor combos that worked really well together. I really liked the savory crepes with the arugula salad! The chicken and waffles was massive! And delicious. The Mexican Benedict was chorizo on a masa cake mmmmmmmm. I'm significantly fatter now.  When you come in and order at the counter and then they seat you. We came in on a Saturday at 10 and only waited maybe 20-30 min for everything, which for tasty brunch on a weekend is great!  Lastly, they have 2 gender neutral bathrooms that are super nice. Great job! Highly recommended!!",

It might be a bit crowded during busy hours. There are entrance in front and behind the restaurant with limited parking spots. The coffee tasted a bit burnt.

Parking is either right off McDowell which is behind the building, or you can park on the other side off 7th Ave.   They have patio seating, or indoor. They close early afternoon so make sure & check hours.   I may try it out again & order something sweet next time. Enjoy the pics",

I think the food is really good, he LOVES the BMOC and the Mexican Benedict is delicious.  HOWEVER, we have repeatedly had just NOT GOOD customer service, at times verging on terrible. The  usual manager is generally rude and seems strangely arrogant. This morning was the last straw. I ordered the orange and ginger cold brew that I always get, but this time it tasted extremely OFF. I drank about a quarter of the glass thinking that maybe it was just in my head but decided that it most definitely tasted like mold. I even had my friend try it to see what she thought and she immediately spat it out it was so terrible. I told the manager and he gave me a different drink, but I told him that I was adamant there was mold in that coffee container and he just didn't seem that concerned. To me serving a moldy drink to a customer is a pretty huge deal.... after this last time dining here I just can't overlook the bad things for the good anymore.",

The meal was fantastic - the pork chop and eggs on the BMOC were perfectly cooked and the light and airy waffle contrasted nicely. If I would have ordered again, and if I had unlimited calories, I would have gotten the Pain Perdu - it is banana bread French toast with a whiskey caramel sauce, so I don't think much more needs to be said. Quick service and an attentive staff made this a fantastic breakfast. The next time I am in Phoenix, I will definitely return.",

I had a lot of trouble picking something as a lot of the menu looks good, but I was very satisfied with what I got.  Ally (vegan): There are no formal vegan items on the menu. However, thanks to the chef who came out to greet us, I ordered the Blackstone Scramble without the meat and eggs with a substitute of potatoes. Delicious and super filling!   It's a smaller restaurant with a hole in the wall feel. When you walk in you have to order your food at the register and afterwards they seat you. No issues there, just different. It's a bit pricey but the quality of food matches the price point, so good if you're looking for a bit nicer of a spot to have breakfast or brunch. Right as we finished eating the line was almost at the door so it might be a good idea to call and ask how busy they are before coming.",

We got the award winning banana French toast. It was super rich and sweet. If you like sweet this one is perfect. It's pretty much like dessert. The bacon we got with it was yummy, thick cut and perfect for the sweet combo.   The coffee was also spot on. They have the Japanese drip system which was just the perfect jolt for the morning.   I liked the decor of the place and the natural light coming in. And they have an awesome mural at one if he entrances.   Looking forward to going back to trying more of their interesting food.",

The customer pays, then waits to get seated and served. Everything went very smoothly and my husband and I were very pleased. The food was delicious! The beverages were self-service (coffee, water, etc.) The staff were all very friendly. Even though it was very busy, with this operation, we really didn't have to wait very long.

Their coffee is very strong and if you just get plain old coffee, it is bottomless, which for an avid coffee drinker like myself, is definitely a win-win. The service was awesome, and their manager came and checked on me twice even though you don't have a server, which I thought was icing on the cake. It's a quiet enough place to do some work, and by being able to order at the counter instead of having a server, there isn't this huge pressure to leave so the server can make more money. Will definitely return to try the cold brew flight!!",

I ordered the Johnnycakes, which are pancakes made with corn and Chile with pear-maple syrup. They were delicious- not spicy from the Chile and definitely savory vs. a normal pancake. They were a little heavy (I could only eat 1.5), so don't expect to want lunch. People I was with all ordered Mexican Benedict's. At first I had food envy as they looked sooooo good (they put egg and meat on sopes instead of English muffins), but after tasting both, I got the better breakfast. Finally, coffee, as described by many other Yelp reviewers, was pretty darn good. The 15 hour cold brews process doubles the caffeine and cuts the bitterness, but, as a traditionalist, I still got the regular coffee. It was great, and I had four cups. This is worth the stop for the experience, uniqueness and overall good food.",

It is chorizo on top of a thick corn cake of sorts...then topped with eggs and hollandaise. I think I probably gained at least a pound from this meal.

    "text": "We were driving across country and wanted to have a great breakfast. We found Vovomeena in Phoenix - a small boutique breakfast cafe. The decor is contemporary and warm - the coffee is fantastic - piping hot and fresh - the food is artisinal and the menu is well conceived.  There are so many delicious sounding items that we agonized over to what to get. My companion settled upon the biscuits and gravy which he found to be spicy and wonderfully herbal and delicious. The person who took my order was kind enough to give me some a la carte items - so I had the waffle with handmade turkey sausage and two lovely poached eggs on a big white plate. Everything was tasty - with the minor exception that my dish was warm and not hot. The host who made a point of talking to all of the guests came by our table and we talked about the temperature of the food - he graciously offered to change it out and I declined. Everyone there was warm and hospitable. The name of the cafe is based on the Portuguese word for grandmother - and the sense of warmth and family and tradition and breakfast is all wonderfully present in this little place.",

    "text": "I really appreciate places like these, where they put a lot of thought and creativity in their foods. I wish I could give it a higher star rating, but I have to be honest. I tried it on two different occasions because I always want to give a place a review after at least visiting it twice. The food is well done and thought out, but maybe the execution is bad or they are trying to doing too much.   The first time actually was a while ago, since I am not usually at this area of town at all. I tried the BMOC which is their signature dish or most popular. While I admit it is very impressive looking, it is very difficult to eat. The pork chop is just so dominating and so salty, that it takes several tries until you can find a right balance. I understand what they are going for, since a lot of other places are always trying to balance this sweet-salty flavors. It is almost impossible to balance and sometimes it comes out bland, because the flavors don't compliment but cancels each other out. I do like complex flavors but I like consistent well define flavors where every bite is the same. It was kind of a let down  The second time, I tried the grillades, which is their take on biscuit and gravy. The beef was nice and tender small pieces, but the sauce was too spicy(heat wise). All I could taste was the heat, it again just dominated everything. I also think that everything is in the details in the dish, the biscuit was dry and chewy and had a weird artificial flavor to it. I had a side of potatoes which were done well , but was cold, I could not believe that they would do that at a place like this. This is a self serve type of place, so as far as service is concerned it is what you expect.   Lastly I really would have given this place a 2 star for its food, but I raised it to 3 star because they were trying to be different and the quality and thoughtfulness of the food is good, just  the execution does not work here.",

I think I'm taking off the star because I felt almost uncomfortable eating there, like I might stain or break some piece of art or antique children that was made by the blind albino children of Nepal (but only the ones named Frank). Can a space be *too* atmospheric? I didn't think so... but I appear to have been proven wrong.  The breakfast was great, though, I had the grillades. Nice, rich, buttery biscuits, delicious peppery gravy, and chunks of very tender beef. Only ding was that they could do scrambled, over easy/medium/hard or sunny side up - nothing else. That covers 96% of the requests out there, but hey, I'm a food hipster, right? I like my eggs basted.",

This is a self serve place, you have to wait in line to order food, then you have to look for a place to sit (very uncomfortable when the place is full, and its tiny too! ), you get your own coffee and refills. The food was not so great, and lacked a lot of seasoning and flavor. The main thing that bothered me was the lack of accommodation of substitutes for their menu. I eat egg whites, and when I was asked how I wanted my eggs cooked, I said egg whites. The guy gave me this frustrated look and weird stare, and told me with attitude \" No, you can't get egg whites, we don't do egg whites\"  Oh, and they also don't do any sides, you want pancakes? be prepared to pay over $10 for another meal.  Rude customer service, poor food choices/accommodations, and terrible coffee. I've had better breakfast and better experience else where and better tasting coffee too. I will not be returning here, not a fan of overpriced self serve places.",

    "text": "We are in town for spring training and this morning I was looking for a nice breakfast spot. I actually found Vovomeena mentioned in an online article listing the five best breakfast spots in Phoenix. We drove up and found quick parking and noticed that they were a fast casual restaurant in that you line up, order at the counter and seat yourself with a number to wait for your food to come out. This actually works very well for this restaurant in that they have a fairly small but eclectic menu (no substitutions please). We got there right in time as we only had one couple ahead of us in line and as we waited I saw an order of their biscuits and gravy get served up. My mind was made up, biscuits it would be. I chased it with their Japanese style ice coffee. The food came out quickly and it was delicious. The gravy had a rich peppery taste to it complimented by the big chunks of sausage generously smothered over a delicious split biscuit. As we ate the line at the counter grew to extend itself out the door. Now for those of you thinking that fast casual means little to no service, Vovomeena will prove you wrong. The food was brought out by a friendly food runner and as we were wrapping up our meal, I believe it was the manger, stopped by to ask us about our experience and chatted with us a while, answering my question about the name of the place. Meena being the nickname of the owners grandmother and Vovo being short for grandmother in Portuguese. It was an awesome breakfast and I would highly recommend it.",

    "text": "I was in Phoenix recently for the WWE Royal Rumble. To kill some time that morning, my friend introduced me to Portlandia on his iPad in our wretched hotel room. Around 11AM, we were hungry and ready to check out, so we consulted Yelp for brunch options and settled on Vovomeena.  Upon arrival, I wasn't sure if I was still in Phoenix, or somehow had been transported into a Portlandia sketch. As others have noted, it's THAT hipster. A \"flight\" of Japanese cold brewed coffee - really? Even more amusing was the proud barista describing the cold brew process and the different coffees. And I have no idea how he could tell the different coffees apart ... it's easy with a flight of beers, but coffee all pretty much looks the same. But after pinching myself and realizing I was still in Phoenix, I went for the flight of cold brews. (When in Rome ... err ... Phoenix, right?)  The food options were equally hipster, with a selection of a dozen or so breakfast/brunch offerings featuring fresh, locally sourced food. The only thing NOT hipster about the food are the prices. I typically expect places like this to be a bit pricy, but Vovomeena is a VERY good value. Most of the selections are in the $7-9 range. I ordered the most expensive selection - the b.m.o.c. It featues a smoked pork chop, waffle, two eggs, and a \"Portuguese Donut Tower\" (basically a funnel cake) for $9.95. My friend got the \"pain perdu\" - banana bread pudding french toast with a caramel glaze and choice of meat for $7.50. Both portions were ample, and everything was delicious.   And even though this is counter service, the service was great. I joke about the barista, but the kid (he looked like he was 17) was really nice and knowledgeable. It reminded me of talking to a brewer (or beer nerd) at a brewpub - he had that level of knowledge. And when I went back for a 16 oz cold coffee after I finished my flight, he admitted he accidentally made an extra flight, and asked if me and my friend wanted it. Thanks dude! Needless to say, between 1 1/2 flights and the 16 oz coffee, I was amply caffeinated for the day.   Of all the places we went to in Phoenix, this was my favorite by far. I doubt if I ever will be back in Phoenix ... but if I do, Vovomeena is a must stop for me.",

I have eaten there 3 times now but I only order 1 thing on the menu which I do enjoy quite a bit because their other items are a little unusual for me.  I went to eat there again yesterday and I was very sorry to see they have removed all side items off their menu. So I cannot order an omelet or 2 scrambles eggs with bacon, or a side of toast. Its one of the nine items or nothing. That does not work for me so that is why i have given this restaurant 3 stars.

The owner/manager checked with us several times to make sure everything was ok.  We went early enough that there was no wait and the food was served within 10 min.  (4)We ordered the boxty and the piperrada with iced Japanese Brew.  I agree with Michael U that the boxty was a tiny bit greasy, but the sweet savory flavor with the added texture of apple crunch was a great mouthful.  The crunchy thick bacon on the side was perfect! The piperrada had good flavor.   I was hoping the pork shoulder would be slow cooked and shredded, but it seemed more like a chopped cured ham type flavor/consistency.   Thanks Vovomeena for a great early breakfast.  Will be coming back until we try every menu item, especially can't wait to taste the portuguese donuts someone else raved about!",

Well, we are here to tell you, this should be the place they are standing in line for, it's that good.  From the moment you walk in and notice the delectable dishes on the tables of the customers, you know you've stepped into something very unique for the palate.  Then, you pick up a menu and you know you aren't in Kansas anymore...........the names of the dishes are different, the ingredients are different, the choices are creative, and about the best coffee I've tasted.  It looks like a factory, but it delivers like nonconformity.  What to have?  we tried the chorizo benedict, the savory crepes, and the grilladas and if we had tummy room, we would have tried more.  Sufficeth it to say, we won't be standing in line for Matt's next time ---- we'll set our sights and our gps to this place!  Well done, vovomeena!",

As you're in line to order you're right outside the kitchen do you can see how fast they're working and getting all these dishes together. They know what they're doing! I got the Mexican Benedict because I saw everyone talking about it here on Yelp. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed!! Perfect portion size and the flavor was so good!! My husband got the banana pudding French toast, the name on the menu was something different, don't remember what it was but his dish was just as good! So much flavor in every single bite.

The only negative thing I can say is that seating (self-seating in this place) can be a little difficult and annoying during busy times, not fun when you have kid/s in tow.  Even more annoying is seeing people lingering over their completed meals and empty cups of coffee, chatting away like they have nothing else to do all day, while there are people waiting for a table to open up.  Not Vovomeena's fault, but the seating issue has factored into my decisions when I find myself wanting to eat here late morning on a weekend.   Anyway, the food is great, the staff is great (I LOVE YOU KAI !!!)  Eat here.  Eat here often.  You won't be sorry!",

I had Savory Crapes and I will dream about them tonight. They were amazing. My boyfriend had BMOC and he was really happy with his order as well.   This place is just one more reason for me to love breakfast even more so.

I saw the cold brew flights on yelp so this easily became a weekend destination. Unfortunately I work most weekend mornings but finally had the opportunity to stop by this previous weekend.  I ordered the waffle with bacon and potatoes. You have NO idea how happy I am that there is a place that offers a breakfast dish with no eggs. I'm not the biggest breakfast fan (because I despise eggs), and unless you feel the same way you don't realize how they are in just about every breakfast dish. Aaaannnyyyyyway, my waffle was awesome (with strawberry jam because I can't stand maple syrup either) and my bacon and potatoes were good too. Got a Portugese donut, because duh, and I was super full after that.  My cold brew flight was good. They use Roastery of Cave Creek coffee which is excellent coffee. This flight consisted of the Black & Tan (a Roc2 roast), vanilla coco-something (vanilla bean and cocoa nibs), and lemon jalapeno. The first two, yes. The last one....not for me. We chatted with the barista when we were leaving about the brewing system they use, as well as espresso drinks. He was very knowledgable and came across somewhat passionate about coffee.  The only downside was that on a Saturday morning, it was a little difficult to relax while eating. It gets pretty crowded and they are quick to clear your table after you have taken your last bite. Service is quick though, and we had no issue getting a table.  We'll be back, for sure.",

    "text": "I'm so glad to have a fun neighborhood spot to go to for brunch! We came here on Saturday morning. We must have arrived with a big wave of people, because there were about 8 people in line waiting to order food in front of us. (FYI - this was rare, the rest of the time we were there, there wasn't more than 3 or 4 people waiting in line) We didn't mind waiting because we got time to look over the menu and look around at the decor. The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere - modern, yet rustic? The only thing that concerned me was that when you wait in line you stand at a shoulder-height counter overlooking the kitchen and there was no protective glass shield. I felt like a misplaced sneeze could've contaminated all the food being prepped on the line!  Our food came out in exactly 20 minutes. For having 8 orders in front of us, I thought that was good time. The portions were generous. I ordered the BMOC and had to take half of my pork chop home (...but I am a girl and I don't eat that much). The food was pretty awesome. The pork chop was tender, the apple sauce (kind of like apple pie filling) they drizzled on top was sweet but not TOO sweet. My only gripe was that they placed the porkchop on top of my waffle and covered the whole thing in apple sauce so my waffle wasn't as crispy as I would've liked. if I ordered it again I would ask for the waffle on the side, maybe on a separate plate.  My friend ordered the Banging Pocket, which he loved. I tried a bite and it was really good! What put it over the top was the salsa that came in a little side cup. I've had many salsas before but there was something really special about this stuff! Very flavorful, kind of tasted like they used roasted tomatoes or something because it had a very deep and rich flavor. He did not have any leftovers to take home.  With all of the interesting choices on the menu, we could come back here several times and not get bored. I also love that you can bring your dog on their outside patio :)  Edited to add that the service was very friendly. When we walked in they explained to us how it works (order food at counter, food served at your table) and everyone else was also helpful too.",

I also tried the Tortilla Espanola which is a great take on the traditional Spanish omelet.  In Spain, tortilla = omelet so don't expect any circular discs of cooked masa.  The Portuguese donuts are tasty treats as well.  Basically, they're fried dough with powdered sugar on top.  Simple and yummy.    The line moved quickly and the food came out rapidly and accurately.  The price is fair as you can have a very hearty breakfast for two with coffee for about $25-$30.  There's patio seating or plenty of tables on the interior.  If in the 7th Ave area, this is a great breakfast/brunch spot.",

I can't wait to go back and try the chorizo eggs Benedict!",

You order before seating yourself, they have their own little coffee bar where you can see how they brew the Japanese drip coffee.   While paying for the meal I noticed some $20 bills in their tip jar so expected a lot. Was sadly disappointed by the three meals that my family shared. The coffee was delicious, the potatoes were delicious....annnnd thats about it. Willing to give the place another chance though!",

The next layer is the best part it was the smoked pork chop grilled to perfection and fork tender. The scrambled eggs on top got the smoke flavor too. Yummy. The other meal ordered was the Wilcox avenue. Scrambled eggs, bacon and wheat toast. All good. Cold brewed coffee is not bitter. Will be back for sure. Counter service very friendly.",

The host quickly attended to us upon walking in to give us a quick how to on ordering at the register and self-seating. The menu had a small but perfect amount of selections. It was difficult to choose because each dish was unique and sounded delish. The burrito had a fresh taste - and I typically do not like burritos.  I'm going back for another for sure. The side of potatoes were perfectly cooked - some had a crisp to them.  The Johnny cakes were amazing! The corn and the overall texture/flavor was on point. Kudos to the chef for the creativity and palette. The decor is modern eclectic with a relaxed friendly vibe. This place is a must!",

I have had the pain perdu which is bannana bread french toast fresh bannanas sliced on top and a whiskey caramel sauce on top and the savory crepes with chicken and egg inside and a homemade sauce over the top.  Both dishes were AMAZING I will for sure go back just for those, but will have to try the rest of the menu first.

Vovomeena is a perfect addition to the 7th Avenue and McDowell corner, which is mostly occupied by chain restaurants. They serve up incredible Japanese cold brew coffee, which makes me wonder if I can ever go back to a plain ol' Starbucks drip. The coffee has great, bold flavor and not bitterness. They have a few varieties and even offer a coffee flight.  The star of the menu is the B.M.O.C. It's a Man Vs. Food-kind of dish -- Schreiner'ssmoked pork chop, waffle two eggs and a Portuguese donut tower with apple-maple syrup. And yes it can be finished in one sitting. The 3 Sister Strata -- a egg and cheese casserole, with zucchini, black beans and corn, is delicious, hearty, yet light. It comes with a side of meat, bacon or sausage, both of which come from Schreiner's Fine Sausages on 7th Street. I love that they source local ingredients, from meat to coffee.   I'm eyeing the Pain Perdu --banana bread pudding french toast --for my next visit or maybe the johnnycakes, made with corn and chili. You really can't go wrong with this menu.",

Very hipster decor but it doesn't take away from the relaxed, breakfast/brunch vibes.   We get Johnnycakes almost every time we eat here. One of my favorite and most unique breakfasts in Phoenix. I could eat this every day. The warm rice pudding on the side is a nice touch. Always enjoy the japanese cold brew but the regular brewed and espresso drinks have also been great.

This gal is super cool, very inspirational and extremely positive. BTW loved the boots.  I learned more today from their coffee guru's about their craft coffee. Japanese Cold Brew. The process is like an IV drip into grounds, a 12 hour process with no heat. This is old Japanese style coffee making. They have a flight of three available light, medium and bold. Three different beans for each. I remember two of the three beans are Ethiopian and Honduras. This was an excellent iced coffee with pure flavors.  My meal was Corn Jonniecake Flapjacks with a side of sweet rice which looked like a pudding, fresh fruit on top and a couple strips of bacon. $7. A delicious breakfast.",

The choice was easy to try Vovomeena when I saw Johnnycakes on the menu.  This is a must for any Rhode Islander that has moved away!  The menu had a few references to my rhode Island upbringing.  Great atmosphere when you walk in - neighborhood place and very comfortable.  The cold drip coffee is unique and has great flavor - I went for the iced decaf today and will get again.  Now for the food - I ordered the Johnnycakes (corn pancakes) light and flavorful with real corn inside adding to the texture of the pancake.  I tried it with a piece of bacon and sausage - both very good.  The twist on the pate was the sweet rice - what a compliment to the johnnycakes. The prickly pear maple syrup compliments it very well.  I will be back and back and back again - thank you!",

The coffee is pretty good, we just had the regular coffee bit they've got quite a selection of brews. The food was great, well priced, and you get a lot of food for what you pay. I recommend getting the sausage, it tasted like it was cooked over an open flame and its taste reminded me of camping :)",

They need just a little of a fifth ingredient; passion. Service is confusing, if you sit at a table they move you because you have to order first, it throws people off and it gets annoying, I left my stuff at a table and they sat someone at that table, I understand the rule, but I guess I really don't like that one.

The Coffee was awesome but the food was way too greasy and way too salty, I felt sick the rest of the day. This all coming from someone who typically likes salty food. I realize breky can be a greasy treat but this was too much fat and salt for my taste.  We tried it again to give it a second chance and went with a friend who happened to be a Vegan. There was nothing on the menu she could eat. It's 2013 ya gotta be a little accommodating to other peoples food restrictions in a restaurant. So, two strikes and you're out in my book.",

For breakfast I had the Wilcox Avenue which was 2 eggs, the best potatoes ever, biscuit and sausage! And yes I added the Portuguese donut!! Everything was amazing! My friend had the pancakes bacon and spuds which was delish as well! My other friend ordered the same as I but with a side of gravy for her biscuit which I normally do not like but she had me taste it and it was the best gravy! The whole place reminded us of our grandma's kitchen! This is REAL comfort good food cooked right to order! It is a nice clean classy diner feel to it! I told the manager we would be back soon, as we were.. the very next Friday! We are calling Vovomeena our little secret and getaway from work!",

You order from a selected menu and pay up front; then, they give you a number and you wait at your table. Their coffee is awesome and the staff is super friendly, but I wasn't too keen with having a selected menu. Reading \"No Substitutes Please\" at the top of the menu didn't help either. The food is okay but nothing blew me away or would make me want to come back.",

We are both spoiled because I cook everything from scratch all the time, so the best way I can explain it is that they had lots of great concepts (using banana bread instead of regular French toast, for example), but the food itself wasn't super flavorful.  The individual ingredients like the meat  and bread used in the benedict could have been tastier.  I loved the fried potatoes that came as a side dish for breakfast.  The coffee was just okay and the espresso wasn't good. I think that most people would probably love it, but if you're an extreme foodie, or maybe it was just us, we wouldn't return.",

The food omg the food was amazing. I had the Mexican Benedict and my gf had the biscuits, gravy and eggs. They were sooooo good the egg was delicious and the chorizo was very good not too salty and everything being on top of the sope I highly recommend this dish. The biscuits were nice and fluffy and the gravy was very flavorful. Next time I'm in the Arizona area this is definitely going to be my go to spot for breakfast. Thank you so much to the man in glasses who I believe was the owner for his hospitality my family and I appreciated it very much. To anyone reading supporting local businesses like Vovomeena are just as good as finding gold I tell ya.",

The restaurant is fine, it's clean, on the smaller side, but nice. I go up to the counter and ask the guy taking the order \"which is better: Pancake or Waffle?\" and he straight faced told me \"They are the same, just a different shape.\" That right there I should've walked out. I ended up ordering the pancakes with eggs and a side of bacon and an Iced Tea. Sat down, and they brought my order relatively quickly. As soon as I saw the bacon I knew I wasn't going to dig it. Tried the pancakes, they had a weird after taste. Not sure if it was the syrup or what, but I didn't get through half of them. Bacon was limp and not very good, blah. Eggs were probably the only thing I finished. I was about to take off when the manager was making his rounds and asked how everything was and if I liked it. I informed him of what I thought of the food and he was quick to offer a refund or replacement. That right there was the best part of my experience, the managers customer service(only reason it didn't get a one star).   Needless to say I have no desire to go back or recommend the place to co-workers, friends or family.",

They have unique food combinations that are delicious, a very comfortable dinning experience and their name is fun to say ~ Vovomeena.  Say it with me; \"Vovomeena\" :-)  zee food ~ My fave is the Mexican Benedict or the BMOC.  They both are excellent choices!  The Mexican Benedict has great favor and textures with poached eggs a top of the english muffins with some chorizo and a great hollandaise.  The BMOC is pockchop/waffle/eggies and a portuguese donut (not made by a portugese person nor flown in from Portugal because I asked..) is a flavor-fest!   My son loves the Pain Perdu which is banana bread pudding french toast with the most amazing whiskey caramel sauce and a side of bacon or sausage.  I like it as well! The coffee is great and they provide you with a to-go cup when you're ready.    zee place to eat ~ it's nicely decorated with plenty of seating despite this place is so small.  They have a few larger tables, which provide you an opportunity to dine with others you may or may not know :-)  The staff is very friendly and they are always ready to help you find their morning moonshine.    It's a great little place for breakfast.  I hope to see you there some day soon!  I'll save you a spot at the end of the big table :-)",

The Pain perdu is Banana bread pudding French toast, whiskey caramel, and a choice of meat or spuds. Like the G that I am, I had the turkey sausage and the spuds (so damn good)! The sausage was OK, but the spuds were cooked to perfection, and let me tell you about that banana bread pudding French toast... \"So, good you'd slap yo Momma\" - Pops! Much like the Terminator, \"We'll be back!\" to terminate some other yummy selections from their simple, but yummy menu selection.  Until Next Time...

I've had Vovomeena bookmarked for a couple months or so, and my sister, who lives nearby, assured everyone it was a solid choice.  First, the vibe is super hip, as others have noted. However, I felt very welcomed, even with my parents and a toddler in tow.   The coffee is obviously a main attraction here, and the coffee bar side is worked by a couple guys who seriously know and care about what they are doing. I got a tea latte, since I'm not into coffee, which they had never made, but they were very interested in making helpful suggestions for something I would like.  The food was delicious, and I think between our party of 8, we tried most of the breakfast menu. The Banging Pocket (Shreiner's sausage, duh, it's the only sausage to eat in Phx these days!), the boxty (unique, kinda fruity), johnny cakes (loved! my fave!), mexican benedict, something about 3 sisters that was slightly mexican in style, and the savory crepes....all were really delicious. I even loved the link sausage and I am usually a sausage avoider.  On top of all that, a cool location, and I cannot recomment Vovomeena enough!",

The coffee was good but overpriced. The food itself was average at best. The bacon I got was tough. One good thing was the arugula salad, the dressing was delicious.

To make an unbiased assessment, I refused to order the pain perdu the first time. My logic being: how good can a place REALLY be if they only serve one fantastic item? So, I ordered the Blackstone scramble while my boyfriend decided to continue his search for the best biscuits and gravy.  The food was as fabulous as I had read. The biscuits and gravy were some of the best he had ever had and I made a personal oath to come try the pain perdu. That mission was completed today and I concur with all the positive reviews.

But after trying Vovomeena this weekend, I may have to make an exception.  When my boyfriend and I walked in, we were a little confused about how it works. The manager was super friendly and guided us through the process. You order at the register, they give you a number, you pick a seat, and they deliver your food. I ordered the tortilla espanola, which is a potato and egg Spanish omelet, and my boyfriend got the pancakes with sausage. We also got two donuts to share, because why not?  The highlight for us both was the omelete. My boyfriend doesn't like eggs, and after trying the omelete, he said he would probably get that next time. The omelete is very basic, but it's still delicious and the hot sauce it comes with adds the perfect kick. We both also really liked the pancakes. Nothing fancy about them- they just taste like really really good homemade pancakes.   While the side of sausage was delicious, my side of bacon was kind of lackluster. I would definitely recommend the sausage over the bacon. The donuts were also just okay. They just didn't taste like they were freshly made.  We got here about 9am and didn't have to wait at all. But by the time we left, there was quite the line waiting for tables to open up since it's seat yourself. They also had a decent sized patio, but since it was raining, everyone wanted to sit inside. I'm thinking the crowd might not be so bad when outside seating is also an option.  I almost forgot to mention, the prices were great! With our two entrees, side of donuts, glass of milk, and a coffee, the bill was barely $20. I will definitely be adding Vovomeena into the brunch rotation!",

Wonderful coffee. Nice people. So awesome.",

However ... upon taking the first bite of their banana bread pudding French toast ... it was as if I was in the restaurant all by myself! It was that good!   Pain Perdu is the name of the dish. I will go back to this place just for another order of that! But it is also fun as the line to order passed directly by the open kitchen. You get to see what all of the dishes look like and even ask the cooks what everything is.  Price: little high Ambience: noisy hustle bustle  Service: quick and friendly  French Toast:  AMAZING!!",

    "text": "Upon entering Vovomeena we knew that the five us stuck out like a sore thumb. Strangers in a new land searching for a delicious breakfast that will carry us through until lunch time.  I didn't catch the gentleman's name, but he knew we were outsiders. He told us about the restaurant. That we were allowed to sit anywhere, and that we should grab a menu and wait in line to order.  While waiting you can check out the cooks preparing others food. The sights and the smells were very inviting, and only made us that much more hungry. The entire menu looked good, so I decided to start the top with the Blackstone Scramble.  Of course you gotta order the bottomless cup of coffee too. I added Almond Milk to mine because I hadn't seen this option out in my native city Las Vegas. Everyone ordered food, and everyone's looked great.  Even better we were all quiet, and most importantly we all cleaned our plates.  We had a wonderful experience at Vovomeena and we will definitely return the next time we visit Phoenix.  I think I'll just keep checking things off the list, and go for whatever is second on the menu next time.  Oh, and if you want a really soothing experience.....go check out the bathroom. It's quite calming.",

Not because the restaurant itself is featured in the show (it's not), but because this restaurant is the sort of place that they're always poking tongue-in-cheek fun of. It's hipsterish, it's a wee bit self-important, and you'll come up on phrases like 'hand-crafted' a LOT, but the simple fact of the matter is that they've got DAMNED good food, some DAMNED good coffee, a DAMNED friendly staff, and DAMNED adequate seating.  We came here for brunch (oh shut up) and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. You *ARE* going to be surrounded by Caucasian hipsters with children named Schuyler and Harrison, but that shouldn't turn you off too much. This place has gotten some good buzz lately, and I'm thinking that they'll probably just get more and more crowded in the coming months. That's why you need to get out there RIGHT NOW and enjoy some good food and good coffee, so when you take your friends with you you can be all like:    \"Oh yeah you know I used to come here all the time before it was popular\"  And you'll be a better person for it.",

    "text": "The food is excellent, the prices are very fair and the customer service is excellent. Super cute hipster location with an open kitchen. When we walked in we were greeted by a friendly guy who seemed to fit the roll of a manager. He explained how it works, you order at the counter first and get a number and there always seems to be enough open space (tables) once you order and get your number. The server will bring your food out a few minutes later.   We all opted for the fresh orange juice, which was outstanding! We had the Pain Perdu which I didn't care for.  I was thinking Pain Perdu was going to be a banana French toast/ bread pudding type of deal, but to me it taste like soggy fruit cake with bananas over it and a rich caramel sauce.The floating manager guy was super accommodating and recommended the Orchard French toast as a replacement. Yummy. The French toast was perfect with the apple ribbons to provide a nice subtle Apple crunch and flavor change throughout the dish. We had Johnny pancakes with eggs over easy which was my fav. The pancakes are huge and delicious and the eggs were perfectly seasoned and cooked. We had pork sausage, turkey sausage and the potatoes side. All were delicious! The sausage was hearty, a bit spicy and good sized, but most importantly, not oily so the high quality of meat should definitely be noted. This was the best turkey sausage I've ever had. We also got the waffle kid's meal which comes with 3 delicious fluffy waffle sections and a sausage for $4.95.   2 adult meals, a kids meal and 3 fresh orange juice for $33 is a very great deal. We can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.",

The quality of the food rivals, well sorta-almost rivals a Big Breakfast, and while that may not sound like an overt compliment, that is actually high praise! The winner point here is the ability to avoid the turista/gawker contingent that plagues Matt's. You can reasonably expect to get a comfortable seat here except mid-mornings on the weekends, when it does get very crowded. We stopped coming for a while when there were more-than-occasional loud-baby issues at these very crowded times last year; it seems to me that management did nothing to encourage the young parents to perhaps take the unhappy one on a brief outdoor excursion to maybe give a break to the other patrons. This would be less of a problem if the acoustics of the layout were different--Vovomeena can get loud when crowded. Anyway, it's a problem all restaurants face, it just seems Vovomeena didn't quite master the communications with the new-child set. We just started leaving when we'd come in and see babies, and then just stopped coming in altogether when this happened a few times in a row. Things seem to have been sorted on this front in 2015, and so we've returned",

    "text": "I think for those of us who came in on the wknd of 9/30 the place was too busy and they still need time to figure out the kinks like others said. It was busy, which is a good sign, but also they were running short on the menu so I wasnt able to get the grillades just yet. Thats what Ive been wanting to try. I did have the BMOC, but it didnt excite me like some of the other reviews. I did have the pain perdu a week prior when it wasnt crowded, which is the banana bread pudding french toast and I have to say those were excellent and by far my fave thing I have tried there. My hubby had the boxty and mexican eggs benedict(by the way to other comment who mentioned, they had Sriracha and Cholulah the day we came in) Hubby said a piece of toast would go well with the Mexican Benedict to help finish up all the stuff on the plate, other then that he liked it, and hes a big fan of the Japanese Coffee also and said he probably wont go to Starbucks again either. The Boxty was interesting, but I was too busy eating my banana bread pudding french toast with Whiskey Caramel Sauce. The food is very rich and Ive found Im stuffed and cant even finish my plate, so Im usually taking some to go. If you are coming with a large group on a busy day you will probably have to sit outside at the big long counter tables. Most of the seating inside is for groups of 2-4. Very happy to get more variety in the strip mall! And yes the manager is out speaking to customers and was carrying food out along with the staff. We will be back!",

    "text": "we went to Phoenix for a show and our son found this place.  Being in the restaurant business myself  I am not so easy to please..... however I found this place so very refreshing with dishes out of the wall. The pricing is right and the food is homy with no pretention to be out of this world. Just VERY good homemade food. My wife asked if she should have the biscuits or whole grain bread. DUH.... the newly fresh baked biscuits were sitting right there in front of her. For those who have all those ideas of what they should do my answer is that those should open their own restaurant and make it better. Easy to talk and critic.... put your money, experience, knowledge and ideas where your mouth is. In my opinion this place is a go. When it come to no changes on your orders....,.. I agree. You are insulting the creator of  the concept. Get a life..... do you ask to split a Mc Donald???? with chipolte sauce???? Mc Do doesn't even know what that is. Congratulation on your concept. Great food and Great coffee. What a way to start the day with a smile.",

The filling was delicious and the sauce that topped it was fantastic. My boyfriend has the Pepperonata which he raved about. Even though it was a busy Sunday morning, we got served  more quickly than we expected. The coffee was excellent as well - a vitally important part of any Sunday breakfast!  As another reviewer mentioned, I would like to see more non-meat options on the menu. I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm not big on sausage and pork chops either. I could probably be happy with the crepes on every visit - they are that good - but I'd like to have a few more choices.  I'd gladly up a star too if I saw that happen.",

Give it a try and you will fall in love. Guaranteed. Oh they also have a really friendly staff. All in all, nothing but best...",

The coffee alone is worthy to make me a continued patron of this place. I'm happy to add this restaurant to a string of Breakfast joint faves within Central Phoenix. Cheers!!!",

No odd dry parts, flavor was incredible. Sauce was perfect. And I got the sausage...yum! Done of the best links I've ever had. Perfect snap and delicious flavor. Hubby got the Mexican Benedict which is fabulous. I'm not a huge chorizo fan nor am I a big corn meal(masa) fan, bit this was epic. My husband who is pickier than a toddler loved it. \"Make sure you give them a good review\" and for him to say that..well it means something. I thought he would be overwhelmed buy the noise, counter order, trendy factor, but in the end none of the discomfort of those things was a problem because the food was that good. Very quick service. I do wish someone ran around and filled your coffee, but it wasn't a big deal to get up and get my own. I'm full, happy, and will for sure be back the next time I'm in town!",

He loves the variety of fresh coffee they offer.   In a fast pace moving line I ended up ordering the Portuguese Pancakes, passed on the meat and had the breakfast potatoes. They are called something else but they are potatoes. I will put it to you like this I am a pancake person. It is one food I could eat daily. Vovomeena has the best pancakes I have ever had in my life. I repeat BEST! I don't know what is in them but the flavor is so amazing I eat them without syrup and butter. My potatoes were good too but the is one problem. A good problem every time I eat here I order pancakes and fill up on them so I miss the opportunity to try anything else.   I could go on about the pancakes forever but I have to not fail to forget there service is top notch. This Resturant is all about customer service. Every person who works there you can tell they enjoy their job.   It is worth the travel I highly recommend stopping in and of course getting the pancakes. lol!",

    "text": "I don't even know what was in the 3 sisters omelet To make it so amazing, but they found the perfect seasoning blend to go with all the cheese and vegetables. Easily the most memorable omelet I have ever had. My husband got the Mexican Benedict, which was really good, but for the first time ever, he was jealous of what I ordered!  The spuds that came on the side were perfectly crispy and tender. The orange juice was unmistakeable fresh. We stumbled in to this place because it was close to our Airbnb and the pictures looked cute. Lucky for us the interior was even better than the pictures. We spent almost the entire meal pointing out interesting touches, and admiring their coffee and tea bar. Loved everything about it, can't wait to make our way back and try something else from their menu.",

Long Review: I've only ate here once and only did take-out instead of dine-in. I've been meaning to come here to try out their breakfast since the rating of review is so high and it's right across from my work place. If I had the time, I would like to dine in next time. Let's start with the exterior. To be honest, this place is easily missed, if I didn't look up on yelp, I wouldn't have notice Vovomeena, which is a damn shame. For people who are used to looking at restaurant with your bare eyes, it's going to be difficult to locate this place since it's behind most of other food shops. However, upon finding the location and the entrance, it was beautiful. Small area outside, yet elegant for people who preferred outside breakfast. Upon entering Vovomeena, the interior environment felt warm and rich (in details of ornaments, of course). I didn't get much look around because I honestly did not have much time until I start my day of work. So, I was more focus on the menu and finding what I'd want to eat. But there were old painting around the walls and frame seems fairly worn out. Do not misunderstand me, this is by no mean a critique, I feel like frames and painting being a little worn out is a sign of classic touch to fit the morning glory of the day, the important meal of the day, breakfast. As for the service, I'm honestly not sure yet since I haven't dine in. But when I did my order and got my order, it was simple and fast so that was good. Now onto my main dish, the food, oh... goodness. I chose Mexican Benedict because egg benedict is my favorite breakfast dish. Upon touching the poach eggs, it felt almost as if soft boiled eggs. However, when ripping its' soft belly, what gurshed out is the shimmering yoke wanting to be playfully poked. On top of that is the balanced hollandaise sauce waiting to be in touch with the yoke. Leaving the other soft side is where you get your crisp bun and ground beef marinated and fried in Spanish ways. On the side the accompanies the egg benedicts is the side of country fried potatoes. Soft and gentle yet fried crispy enough to hear a crunch upon the bite. It also well seasoned that ketchup isn't necessary. All that said though, it wasn't enough to go out of my way to stop by here and grab breakfast everyday because, really? $12 something for a breakfast? That's a bit much even for mid class. It is True that price is purely subjective without doubt, but in my book a breakfast should be no more than $8. But anyway, I definitely recommend trying this place out, but I wouldn't recommend eating here everyday unless you're here for light coffee or if you have extra money to spend. Otherwise, I feel that this place is worthy of eating.",

Salsa that was served with this was quite good. Pocket itself was ok in both of our opinions. Try the Portuguese donut as well...mostly like a funnel cake but still tasty. Only drawback to this place would be the limited seating especially if you have a large party. Otherwise, for 2-4 people, you shouldn't have any problems.",

So you wait on line to order your food before getting seated. We were a party of 7 and they were nice enough to seat us towards the back by ourselves.   From the other reviews on yelp I ordered the banana french toast and it was delicious. If you have a sweet tooth definitely go for this. I also really appreciate the potatoes that came with it since it added the right amount of savory to my sweet dish. I had thought i ordered a donut and the waitress went to check on it for me. When she came back she told me I actually didnt order it but they made an extra and gave it to me. Legit almost started crying 1. because i cant believe i forgot to order the donut. i love donuts! and 2. that she just gave me one.  I dont remember what my friends ordered but they all really enjoyed their food and we all enjoyed our donuts! It was light fluffy and had a healthy dusting of sugar!  The service was great and they never rushed us to leave even though we were a big party and took up a rather large table. I'll definitely remember this place the next time I'm back in Phoenix.",

One piece was fairly crispy and the other very limp and fatty.",

Everything is/was delicious  Blackstone Scramble was yummy & I took half home to eat later and that turned out to be what's happened with every dish I've gotten there. Tortilla Espanola was good, light, & delish but I only got one bite cause it wasn't mine.  My boyfriend had nothing to bring home so it was at least that good.  We did a Mexican Benny & a special Portuguese Benny and shared each having one of each, again, I brought half home. This was so good and the eggs were poached perfectly. Not spicy so I loaded the Cholula and the potatoes were great for soaking up the extra sauces. On the sweeter side of the menu we've tried the Pain Perdu which is SUPER SWEET!!! Dense and delicious 2-4 bites and wow enough sugar for a week! The Orchard French Toast is my favorite, a quarter of this dish is plenty but totes worth it!!! Lastly, GET COFFEE, it's all so good and then add some sweet Italian cream and you're in heaven.  bon appetit!   Also, the servers are friendly and will grab you a to go container if you need so you don't have to wait for the line if it's long",

What drew me to Vovomeena was the beautiful mural on the outside of the restaurant.  We came on a day that wasn't too busy and decided to sit in the back outside to be on our laptops. The wifi isn't amazing and there will be a lot of little birds hopping around outside in the summer. But overall Vovomeena is one that I would return to when I come back to Phoenix!",

    "text": "Vovomeena has delicious food, and good coffee. Before we had kids I would have given it 4-5 stars. The seating is a little cramped, and I don't love the counter service model, but before kids those negatives were easy to overlook.   Since having children (2) it pains me too say that I won't be returning. The counter service model makes it nearly impossible to order. You can't sit down until you've placed your orders, and tables are already slim pickings. The management acts irritated with everything (even before I had kids) but that is super amplified with kids. If your order takes a second, or your kids are antsy (remember they have to wait in line too, because they can't sit down), or you add a juice to the order or anything really the two male managers make you feel like shit. They glare at you, they sigh, they DO NOT offer to make anything easier.   The last straw was that my wife took our boys to breakfast on a weekday morning, early. It wasn't busy. She had our 2 year old and was carrying our 7 month old. She ordered, they made her feel bad in the way described above. No one offered to help her carry the 2 orange juices she ordered, so she had to leave them at the counter, find a table and come back for them even though there was no one in line behind her. Then she had to ask where the high chairs were (arms full of infant and hand holding a 2 year old) and the manager pointed to the corner and then watched as she sat our 2 year old at a table alone so that she could carry the high chair with our son still in her arms. Then she had to sit him in the high chair, strap him in and walk back to the counter to get her drinks. Meanwhile they were still no new customers.   I just feel like ok, you're a counter service restaurant, but she specifically came a time that wouldn't be busy. Customer service should never be this bad. Also, guess what? Kids are part of the human race and having them shouldn't disqualify you from eating at a breakfast joint. The food is good, but everything else sucks.",

The menu looked more unique than the other locations open so I figured this would be my breakfast stop while I was in town. The location is super cute with plenty of shaded outdoor seating. The inside is really trendy and casual. It's an order at the counter then find your seats kind of place.  I went super early before it got busy so we ordered and sat down pretty quickly. I ordered the Blackstone Scramble, my boyfriend ordered the Johnnycakes. While the Blackstone Scramble was very tasty, the Johnnycakes totally stole the show. The corn pancakes were out of this world, and the prickly pear maple syrup was so unique. I kept stealing bites from his plate while also eating my own scramble. I also enjoyed the sweet rice that came with the Johnnycakes, it was basically warm rice pudding.  If you're looking for a quick, casual place to get a unique breakfast and some good coffee; Vovomeena is the place!",

I had the Mexican Benedict which was poached eggs with chorizo on sopes was great and ordering a waffle on the side is a great choice.  I've been curious about this joint for some time. I'm not going to claim myself as a breakfast connoisseur, but my gut knows what it likes and that's Vovomeena. I did enjoy popping the poached egg, it's always rewarding to see the yolk smothering it all.",

Then servers come by with your food pretty shortly after. There is also a separate coffee bar. The set up is more fast casual, but the quality of the food and layout is definitely that of an upscale brunch place. The food is SO GOOD!!! You cannot go wrong with any of it, but I highly recommend the Blackstone scramble. I would 100% return!",

    "text": "I AM SO HAPPY that I finally made it in to Vovomeena! You guys, this place lives up to the hype and I absolutely love it.   For starters, the setup was a bit different than I expected. You stand in line and order at the counter (which is cool because you can see the chefs cooking up their creations as you wait), then get a number, visit the coffee bar (because you MUST get their Cold Brew), and then the manager will find you a table. You cannot snag a table BEFORE you order. But it was packed when we showed up and by the time we got through the line, there was the perfect table for our group of 4! So don't fret!   I ordered their classic breakfast sandwich that was on the softest brioche bun with eggs, bacon, pepper jack cheese, and chipotle aioli. It. Was. Dreamy. They served simple breakfast potatoes on the side that were also fab. I am a sucker for potatoes so this as the side made me happy! I also snagged a fresh orange juice and then our group ordered a jug of their Cold Brew because we all had to try it. If you have a group, the jug is the way to go. Let me tell you, I am so happy that we did because you guys, this stuff is amazing and will give you the energy boost that you need to get through the day!   I will 100% be back ASAP because it was incredible! Definitely expect a wait between 9a-12p on weekends because it is a very popular spot but they've got it down and you won't even notice that you're waiting! The ambiance is GREAT. See you soon, Vovomeena!",

I usually go for the sweets but was craving some protein so my friend and I split the Pain Perdu and the 3 Sisters Omelet - it was perfect. The omelet was good with a good amount of veggies and not completely overwhelmed with cheese but the Pain Perdu just stole the show. It was a banana bread pudding french toast, so think a really dense banana bread, but moist like a french toast, topped with a sliced banana. For most items on the menu, you have a choice of meat (bacon, sausage, or turkey sausage) or spuds. Obviously, I went for bacon and it was perfect, balancing out the sweet Pain Perdu. Vovomeena gets a thumbs up from me!",

My husband got the waffle with pork and egg and it was not like anything we've had before, so many levels of flavors and textures. We left thoroughly satisfied. The inside and patio of this place are so cute too! The only thing we didn't like is the \"order at the counter then sit down\" style but it was worth it here.",

    "text": "I found myself with a morning free and contacted a very good AOB buddy of mine, T, and asked him if he wanted to join me for coffee and a bite to eat. \"Sure, but I only have an hour or so. Where do you want to meet?\" He said. Hmm, he lives about 2 miles away from Vovomeena and I had bookmarked this place a while ago so it seemed like a good time to give it a try. First of all, let's deal with the location. No problem for me. Personally, I typed the address into Google Maps and let the software do its thing. I read some people were unhappy because Vovomeena was hard to find. I guess they don't have a cell phone with Google Maps, or a computer at home with same, or GPS in their car, or... seriously. If you can't find a place that has an address, who's fault is it? Bash the establishment? It just makes you look silly. The place is on the South East corner of McDowell and 7th Ave. It's there. Just pull in and park, you'll find it. Once you're inside you'll be happy you went through all the hard work it was to find Vovomeena in the first place. OK, I'm being sarcastic. The innards are cool. Simply laid out with a coffee bar as you walk in. And it serves Japanese Cold Drip Coffee so if you're a fan, get some. There's also a good variety of other coffee's according to my friend so the variety should satisfy most coffee drinkers. Plenty of Yelpers have pointed out how you order and blah blah blah, so I'm not going to go over it again. I felt the guy behind the counter who took our order was very pleasant. I had a few questions about the menu since I was a Vovomeena virgin and he gave me all the insight I needed. We chatted about nothing in particular and he seemed like a very pleasant person. We had already grabbed a table in back before we ordered so once our orders were in T got himself some coffee and I opted for the fresh orange juice. Yummy stuff. The orange juice that is. I don't drink coffee.  I had the Banging Pocket ($9.95). This thing is huge. I was very impressed with the portion size. A delicious pita stuffed with scrambled eggs, sliced Schreiner's sausage, and smoked gouda. I felt everything worked together well. Winner winner Pita dinner. Could it have used maybe some other ingredients? Sure, I'm a chef. But I think the focus here is showcasing the Schreiner sausage, which this \"sandwich\" did. I enjoyed it. If you read the ingredients on the menu and think it should have something else, ask. There were also some lovely breakfast type potatoes alongside. T ordered the Pain Perdu ($9.50). It's a banana bread pudding French toast with Whiskey caramel sauce. He said it was pretty good. It looked good. He ate the whole thing. There were a couple of, let's say, hiccups however. The plastic varnish coating on out table was peeling away. That's because the sanitizer, cleaner and whatever else they might spray on it to wipe it down does nasty stuff to the top coat of the tables. Another issue is that since T and I ordered separately our food didn't come out together. T ordered first and I asked the guy taking the orders if he could just put my order under the same number. Nope. No can do. So the food didn't come out together. In fact, the food came out way to far apart. 3 - 5 minutes. Unacceptable. Both are easy fixes though.  Great Food. Fair Prices. Pleasant Staff. Timing issues. Furniture in need of repair/replacement. 4 Stars.",

It's hidden behind the Five Guys in that center so we'd never even seen it before. We were fortunate that it was not as busy as some other Yelpers have experienced and,showing up during a lull, the coffee bar guy even came over and discussed the menu with us.   Great service, great food, love the atmosphere and coffee. And all just an easy bike ride down 5th Ave. Sinfully delicious but a worthwhile breakfast bookmark.",

However I lucked out and found this place. Cute little brunch ish spot.  Most of the menu said \"your choice of meat\" so that meant for me as a veg look elsewhere until I found the roasted veggie and egg burrito (to go only) for ~5.50   I raced back to my desk and tore open the bag. It smelled great maybe beacuse it was also close to 1:30pm and I was starving, but it was a bit small, the tortilla was a bit too soft and moist for my liking the eggs were well cooked as were the veggies the cheese added a bit too much grease for my liking.  The included salsa was unique as it was hot more like a chunky tomato soup.  If you are not veg maybe you will find a few more options than I.",

The location was ridiculously hard to locate, the decor is adorable, and the food was subpar. Walking in had no direction on what to do, apparently you walk to a wall and grab a menu then proceed to the cashier stand and order, then grab a number and seat yourself, which I found to be slightly edgey yet confusing. My cashier was unpleasant to order with as I was with a vegetarian person and she wouldn't budge on letting us upcharge for a french toast? It would have to of been a separate charge to an addition of their meal. I ordered a Mexican Benedict which seemed like a nice modern twist, everything they could have cooked before service, THEY DID AND IT SHOWED. The poached egg, was over cooked (no runny yolk at all) and cooked well before I ordered, as were their breakfast potatoes, which were too thick, par cooked, slightly cold and just mainly inedible. Overall, it's a neat concept restaurant, yet I would not go back.",

    "text": "If you've read my reviews of Tuck Shop or Astor House, you knew I would be at Vovomeena within a week of them opening.  My dad and I made breakfast plans and he requested Astor House.  I let him know they opened a new place right by Easley's we had to try instead.  He happily obliged. Vovomeena is a saving grace for an awesome brick center that was face-lifted to house small chain eateries.  I shouldn't be so hard; I love Zoyo too.  Just like Astor House (and the other eateries there), Vovomeena is order at the counter and a staff member will bring you your food.  I recommend finding an open table before ordering and claiming it with sunglasses or a book.  We were there the weekend after it opened and open tables were sparse.  I'm sure by the time I finally got around to writing my review (two months later) that it must be much busier and tables even more sparse. I woke up that day craving biscuits and gravy; so I naturally ordered the biscuits and grillades.  See my Astor House review if you want to know more about this tasty dish.  (It's just as awesome in the aves).  At a little nudging from me, my dad ordered the BMOC - Big Man On Campus.  Heck yes!  A deliciously rich waffle topped with the best pork chop I have ever had, over medium eggs, syrup, and a Portuguese donut for good measure.  I knew the waffle would be bomb because I've had the waffles at Tuck Shop (you can read about those too in my Tuck Shop review).  This pork chop was heavenly.  I'm telling you that I'm seriously planning to make pork loin with maple syrup in homage to this pork chop at Christmas.  Cut it with a fork smoked tender meat... oh my goodness!  I don't know that I could ever finish a BMOC on my own, but was happy to eat some of my dad's.  The donut was a perfect dessert my dad and I shared at the end.  Light and fluffy with a taste reminiscent of funnel cake.   Vovomeena has that amazing cold brewed coffee chocked full of the caffeine I love.  Fantastically attentive and friendly staff - probably from all that cold brewed coffee. The space is that modern, industrial chic that we all love.  There's a buffet table near one of the entrances we thought was the hostess stand before we determined it was also counter order and seat yourself - my only complaint.  Though it is not really a complaint.   I can't wait to go back and try more.  I'm disappointed in myself that I was so hell bent on having grillades that day, I didn't get to try two brand new dishes.  Luckily, it's just down the street.",

    "text": "My partner and I have been to Vovomeena three times, and everytime it was great. Full disclosure, though, the second time we went we only got the iced coffee as their kitchen had run out of food! (This was around 12:30 on a Sunday; absolutely forgivable for a restaurant who just opened and is working out the kinks, and if that's the worst thing that will happen when we visit then that's a pretty great sign.)  The space is absolutely gorgeous. You forget that you're in the midst of a glut of chain restaurants and it definitely rivals the Tuck Shop for ambiance. It's wonderful that they're both different yet obviously part of the same family. Another thing those two spots have in common? Gorgeous, uni-sex restrooms. It's a small touch, but it always make a restaurant feel more like home when the washroom is nice and I always appreciate non-gendered restrooms.   Another plus is the counter service; it makes things a little quicker and is smart for the lunch concept. The service itself has been gracious, from the barista to the counterperson to the kitchen staff to the busers, with a special mention to the manager, who has been sincere and nice. This level of service is impressive for a new restaurant. (Stark contrast to the Chipotle 20 feet away, where the staff still acts like it's the first opening day and runs around like chickens with their heads cut off, but that's a whole other review!)  Lastly, the food is fantastic. I had the B.M.O.C. the first time to quench my enormous weekend appetite and the pork chop was remarkable. The waffle got a little lost, but I tried the waffle on its own the last time I was there and I think I'll just get that from now it, as it's really fantastic all by itself. Other items tried and approved, the tortilla espanola and the johnnycakes were really great. (The rice that comes with the johnnycakes was a fantastic complement to the johnnycakes, please don't get rid of it like another review suggests!) The prices are fair, I think ordering a la carte might be the most economical option if I end up going here as often as I want to. Also, the food comes up a little slowly but it's nothing unusual for brunch.  My only critique, although I'm not taking off a star: please get real maple syrup! I saw some fake syrup being walked into the kitchen one day, and the syrup that came with the waffle seemed overly sweet, so I'm guessing that the real stuff isn't being served. I could be wrong, though, as I'm not maple syrup expert, just an enthusiast. All the other ingredients seem top notch, though (thanks for locally sourcing the meat, so this former vegetarian can eat it without much guilt!)",

This morning I got their signature Japanese iced coffee and the Espanola which was kind of an egg, potato, spinach and cheese pie with a chunky red sauce that is bursting with flavors.  The decor is sustainable and hip, chairs were comfortable, lighting is good, staff is friendly and personable as well... Can you tell I like the place?",

I truly had a wonderful breakfast, I ordered the Wilcox Avenue which is a traditional breakfast - i wanted to play it safe.. lol And it was amazing. as i was waiting for my food i saw a few other dishes that looked amazing. The menu is small yet the options have so many items it seems bigger. The best part is the coffee bar which is all \"locally crafted\" as it states on their menu. They can make u just about anything!! Ben the Barista was a super sweet guy and gave great service!! The decor is beautiful. Check it out!! u will not be disappointed!!",

    "text": "Me and my bf have been wanting to try this place for a while because we've seen other Yelpers' reviews and pictures. First off, for first timers, vovomeena is one of those places where you stand in line and order first then get to find a table, which I don't mind, unless there are no tables available by the time you order. We ended up sitting outside. The food came out pretty quickly; I ordered the Mexican Benedict and my bf ordered the Banging Pocket. My food looked good at first glance, until I noticed a puddle of grease under the eggs. Since it was a variation of a traditional Benedict, it came on sopes instead of English muffins, which was not my cup of tea. The Banging Pocket was described to me as cheesy eggs and sausage in a pita.  It was very one-note and just needed something... The food was nothing to rave about and definitely nothing to come back for. We decided that this was one of the few times Yelp ratings and reviews let us down :(",

The food was very delicious, ordered a sandwich (forgot which one) and enjoyed it way more than my date :-0   My only complaint, is the parking sucks as it seems they share a small lot with other businesses.",

Absolutely one of my favourite breakfast places in CenPho and every single trip here has been a wonderful experience. They have enough cold brew here to fuel a zombie army for ever with those massive yama towers in the background. The coffee is fresh and strong and the barista is very friendly and helpful.  The decor is definitely worth taking a picture or two, the place is spotlessly clean every single time and  the portion sizes are generous. Definitely will come back for more !",

    "text": "This is my first and may be my last experience with Vovomeena. Google Maps is our constant companion while on travel as is Yelp in helping us to navigate an area which we are unfamiliar. My husband and I value our breakfast time and after a search I decided upon this local place. We made our way over with the help of Google maps and imagine our surprise when the app said we were there but none of the restaurants were of the name we were seeking. Puzzled we walked about the corner thinking a restaurant should have some kind of signage especially if tied to the same block of businesses. Still nothing. Having gone so far I was not deterred and proceeded to call the restaurant. The phone was answered and I asked for help if we were at the right location. Somewhat tinged with an air of pretension the staff person directed us to the back area of the business fronts stating we had to gain entrance through the courtyard. My husband and I made our way around the side of the building and saw a sign (at last!) that stated Access to Courtyard. A bit wary because it looked like the area where they would dump grease or trash I slowly creaked open the heavy metal gate to come upon a small man seated upon a bucket having a smoke. I asked if this was the entrance in a somewhat sheepish tone but also keenly aware that local businesses can at times have their quirks. He looked at me and chuckled but said nothing aside from a slight shake of the head. I asked again unsure if we were in on the joke or the butt of it and then slowly backed out thinking this can't be right. One final push took us around the corner to the back where finally we saw a small patio area with a sign (yay, another one) nestled in a receded business area that directed us to the restaurant. At the entrance there were posted directions for guests (a bit Soup Nazi-ish  but I guess they need order) and my husband and I after making our decisions made our way to the register. The cashier was not friendly asked for our order and had the air of pretention and exasperation with new guests that immediately made me feel unwelcome as if our presence was a bother (think nothing of the need for patronage and common courtesy for your customers). I ordered a variation on eggs benedict while my my husband had an egg scramble with a tortilla, coffee, orange juice and waters. We chose outdoor patio seating to have our meal. Not long after a gentleman came out with our food which looked reasonably good but was made better by his much more customer service oriented attitude. My meal was 2 poached eggs set upon a bed of chorizo with 2 hockey puck sized corn meal discs. The dish was \"ok\". To me not worth the effort and slights taken but enough to fill the void. My husband found his eggs to be a bit bland as well and used a copious amount tobasco sauce to give it additional flavor. Coffee was fine and maybe would have bliwn my socks off had we ordered the specialty coffee and not just the regular offering. Wanting to end with a bit of sweet we ordered one Portuguese doughnut to share. The doughnut was a small disc made heavy with the residual grease gathered at the bottom from not having been drained properly. We ate little of it noting the simplicity of such an offering goofed not speaking well to an establishment that holds itself in such high regard. Overall the experience was lackluster and little effort made by staff to make it any better less the server of our food. WilAnd then l I make my way back ever? Probably not. I think a business should value it's customers and not think a haughty attitide will be made up for with mediocre food.",

I would recommend this to everyone who's around the area looking for a quick breakfast/brunch place. Will go back once I head out to AZ again!",

The parking lot is small but we had no issues - we came on a Monday at around 9 am so it was not packed and not a long wait. I am not sure how packed it is on the weekend but on a weekday, it was totally a laid back and chill atmosphere. They have a separate place where you can get drinks and cups for ice water.   The food was amazing! The innovative menu and obvious care in the prep of the food and tasty, generous portions is the reason for the 5 stars.   We loved the BMOC - waffle (soft inside and just melt-in-your mouth delicious), a tender sweet-yet-savoury pork chop, and an apple syrup that I wish I could buy a bottle to take home, and a egg. OMG! It was so good, better than any version waffles I have ever had. It is worth a trip just to have this! It came with a Portuguese donut which was too delicious to describe with mere words (I think it would have tasted like pillows of heaven if it had been warmed up...).  The Mexican Benedict was novel - spicy meat topped with an egg. I have to admit I have had better hollandaise sauce but it wasn't bad, just not the best... The corn (?) tortillas-like cup instead of English muffin I didn't really think added much to the dish - might I suggest a sweet corn pancake instead? Well, that's just the foodie in me imagining I could do better   There are so many other menu items that look just unbelievable and I need to try so I am definitely coming back!",

    "text": "I'm so sorry to write this review, especially after reading some of the higher rated reviews, but here's my opinion.  First things first: seating. For large and wide bodies, pure agony! The seats are very small and uncomfortable. There are outside benches that will accommodate large bodies like mine, but it's August. I'm not eating outside.  Inside the place is very cute. You order at the register and your food is subsequently delivered to your table. Self serve water with small plastic pixie cups so if you're thirsty, fill several cups at one time.  I ordered the Wilcox which consists of a salty biscuit, a strange tasting jam, half cooked bacon, sliced half done potatoes, scrambled eggs. I was not happy.   Thinking back, I should have asked what the jam was made of rather than simply ignoring it. Also, I could have asked them to crisp my bacon, but it was busy and I didn't want to bother people.   All in all, I will return to try another dish, but I'll have to return when it's pleasant enough for me to sit outside.",

The ordering is seamless, there was a line on a Sunday morning, which would be expected and the manager helps you find a seat. I ordered the Mexican Benedict and bottle water, $16. I sat down and shortly after my plate arrived. I had my first bite and it seemed a bit underwhelming. The hype with all the positive reviews I was anticipating a breakfast packed full of flavor and originality. I felt it fell quite short, lack of any taste or unique flavor. It wasn't the best, but certainly not the worse. I wouldn't go back, if I had a choice.",

I normally don't eat salads but this one was arugula and it tasted pretty crisp. My bf said it tasted like grass, but I told him if it did then people would be eating grass by the handful. I chose the sausage as my meat option and it had a similar mouth feel like bratwurst.   My bf liked the simplicity of the classic egg sandwich. Can't go wrong with classic.",

Pick up a menu before you get to the register to order & before finding a seat.. you will get a number and a mug, to get your own coffee if you have drip coffee with your order ..  I've had the Mexican Benedict it was a delicious twist on chorizo & eggs .. every bite was full of flavor.. highly recommend   On my recent visit I had the Wilcox Avenue which comes with eggs your way, schreiner sausage (locally made, amazing.. so good!), potatoes & toast with a jam that I poured on everything it was delicious.. possibly homemade.  The drip coffee is also rich and flavorful without that burnt aftertaste you get from a lot of coffee places. The coffee counter has your choice of milk .. soy almond half&half and all the sugar options you could need as well.  Stop by the place for breakfast lunch or brunch you won't be disappointed",

I had the Johnnycakes which was, \"two corn and chile cakes, prickly pear syrup, sweet rice, choice of meat or spuds\" ($9.50).  My favorite part of the dish was the sweet rice which was essentially excellent rice pudding! Mmm I'm wondering if I can just order that on its own.   The pancakes weren't bad, just not my jam. I took what I couldn't finish home and used my maple syrup on the cakes, and it was much better! I think the prickly pear syrup is just too subtle.  The place is however very beautiful! Love the interior design, truly some original features like the vertical rope divider (my favorite part).",

You order first, and then you wait in another line for the manager to seat you (they don't allow you to seat yourself or save tables). I thought that was a little weird but oh well- we didn't end up waiting too long after ordering to be seated.   I'm giving Vovomeena 3 stars because the food just was not that impressive. I ordered the classic egg sandwhich and was so excited about the chipotle aioli sauce but the sandwhich ended up being pretty dry and flavorless. I would not order this again. I also tried the Mexican egg Benedict which I was not impressed by either. The meat was not marinated well and the sopa was very rough. Overall, the food was not as enjoyable as I hoped.",

There's areas to work, areas to socialize and an outdoor patio. The food is unique, as they are adjacent to common fast food chains. Their menu is creative and it was really good food.  The 'meh': It was a tad pricey, especially given there are much less expensive choices within twenty feet. And yes, at least one of them are very healthy. More good : Vovomeena has a healthy menu.  The ugly: Parking! Oh man. Tiny lot afforded to a very popular corner. There are a few alleys to navigate, two very busy roads, and an extremely popular location with a small parking lot. There is a road parallel to McDowell you can park on, but be careful, lots of driveways and some no zones.",

It is definitely a hidden gem, and I'm so glad I found it!  As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by the manager and prompted to order at the front . The menu selection is very diverse for brunch. After reading the various reviews on Yelp, it seemed that the Mexican Benedict was one of the most popular items so that's what I got. Despite being pretty busy, the food was done in less than 20 minutes for our table! This is crazy for a nice brunch place! I'm use to waiting at least an hour for food and table! Not here!!  The Mexican Benedict was very flavorful and unique. I've never had anything quite like it for breakfast! Poached eggs were perfectly cooked on a bed of chorizo and sopes. My partner got the 3 sister omelet. Very cheesy with unique flavors!  All in all, this hidden gem has top notch brunch and coffee  at a reasonable price without the crazy long waits of other places in the valley! Will definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "After several years of going here, it seems they've finally set into their stride.  I almost always order the b.m.o.c. and I encourage you to do so as well.    When they first opened they would endeavor to really impress you with the dish, the quality is still there, but the presentation has become more functional, with less pizzaz.    The proprietor is almost always there, and makes the rounds to his customers, a good touch.   The wifi seems slow and weak.   The coffee is very excellent, and I suspect they hate wasting such excellent coffee because it's almost always on the verge of running out.  Good job at increasing the size of the coffee mugs, which reduces the number of refill trips.   There's sometimes a long line so I would get their either before or after the brunch rush.  I've gone at 1pm for a late Sunday brunch and there was nobody in line.   Overall, 5 stars.  The menu is so dialed in I am sure, but I'd love to see some new things, or variants on the classics.  I know exactly what I'm going to get when I go to Vovomeena... A good solid breakfast.",

I have always had such positive experiences here, and whenever I have family or friends in town I bring them to vovomeena. I think the quality of each dish is outstanding time and time again, paired with the friendly staff and quick service I am never disappointed. If you come before 8 you won't need to wait too long, but even if you do come in the busier time of day 9:30-12 its worth the wait! Thank you Vovomeena! And as always support local and family owned businesses.",

I remember being satisfied though.  The way they have the service set up is that you get seated (or in a cue) once you place your order.  Tables are turned rather fast and food comes out pretty quick as well.  I loved the self serve tea and coffee station they have, it really sets the vibe for Vovomeena and makes you feel like you're in another state/country.  I did have an issue with my plate, however the server immediately gave attention to the matter and swapped it out right away.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends/fam and can see this being an instant favorite brunch spot!!",

    "text": "I came here last Saturday with my best friend for a post Junior League rummage sale breakfast and we were impressed.    The decor is cute, you feel almost like you are in someones home, even if the traffic flow and set up the restaurant is somewhat perplexing at first.  Soon enough we figured out where and how to order.    For other first timers, apparently you grab a menu at the end of the line that runs right in front of the open kitchen, you chose what you want while in line and then place your order and pay at the end of the line.  Not a bad set up as it allows you to see right into the cooking stations and watch the chefs in action (which is both neat and reassuring at the same time) but, when you get to the end of the line and pay that is where you are expected to also add your gratuity, and I just don't like the idea of having to pay gratuity on a meal before I've even been served or tasted the food.    Am I the only one that feels that way?  I think setting it up like that almost encourages patrons to hold back on the gratuity because we have to bet on the law of averages and assume that the service will be mid-grade so that we're not over tipping and if the service was great the server loses because lots of people don't carry cash.  I'm definitely not gonna swipe my debit card again simply to pay an additional gratuity.  Tipping at the end of the meal represents a better snapshot of how the diners experience really was.  Okay, getting off my soapbox now...  So, I ordered the Mexican Benedict and it was very good; spicy, savory and filling.  The poached egg was laid atop a perfectly flavorful bed of chorizo and smothered in delicious Hollandaise sauce.  Sadly I didn't detect any tomato or cilantro in mine.  Perhaps it was cooked into the chorizo and that's why I couldn't taste it?  That's okay though.  Honestly, the only aspect of the meal I didn't like was the dense, cold sopes that the eggs were perched atop of; they were hard, flavorless and cold.  While I understand wanting to keep with the Mexican theme, I still think that an English muffin (or anything else) would have been a better option here.  Or maybe just heat up the sopes first, so that they're hot and soft?  My best friend ordered the Pain Perdue with whiskey caramel sauce.  Oh, dear sweet, 6 lb, 7 oz. baby Jesus, it was SO GOOD.  It had the perfect texture and sponginess and spice.  You could really taste the bananas and the whiskey sauce was the perfect complement to the French toast; amazing.  It was served with two pieces of breakfast meat (she chose bacon) and the bacon was just so-so.  Not really brilliant or detracting, just your average piece of bacon.    She had a caramel latte and I had a plain cup of coffee, she loved her coffee and I thought mine was just okay.  Again just average coffee.  Decent, but not exotic in any way.  The service was very good and we were brought our food within just a few minutes of taking our number and having a seat.  About halfway through our meal we were checked on to make sure we were doing well, we were, and then we spent the rest of the meal enjoying the food and the decor and making silent comments about the eclectic assortment of guests around us.  (When you've been best friends for over 25 years, you learn to have whole conversations with just a look.)     So while I did mention a couple of things that I thought could be improved upon (the cold sopes and the advance gratuity being the most important issues) I still had a great visit, and it was a nice breakfast out for both of us.  We will definitely be back.",

He gave me a menu and explained a little bit about the process of what to expect when dining here. While you wait in line to place your order you're able to watch the cooks grill up some of the tasty plate options which makes it even tougher to figure out what you want to eat. The aroma from the grill is just intoxicating!! Ok.... focus!!! :) So, the juice if freshly squeezed here too. Talk about every single detail was evaluated here. You are seated after you order your food so don't pick a table prematurely. You can choose to dine in or outside either way the atmosphere is very inviting. So back to the food. I've had the chorizo, biscuits and gravy, waffles and chicken, and the ham. Everything tasted spectacular and was cooked perfectly. The way that they plate the food here is a work of art. I guess you can see that I'm a fan. So fellow yelpers and foodies you need to come and check this spot out if you haven't already, see you there!",

Five stars for the first visit, and 1 star for the second- great coffee, and free refills to boot, so what's not to love?, so an average of 3 stars.  Will return to try the B.M.O.C. again.  Hope to bump it up to four stars, which is a good review from me, as I'm assuming this isn't a GMO-free establishment...",

The dish is just called \"johnnycakes.\" You know, johnnycake - noun - a flat cornmeal cake typically baked or fried on a griddle.  I received two, plate-sized. Studded with corn. Stacked with fresh strawberries. Oh, and scoop of sweet rice pudding. Plus, two sausages. And a pitcher of prickly pear maple syrup. So, when you order the johnnycakes, know that it may be a working title, and that the definition is approximate at best.   Use this flexibility to your advantage and continue adding brunch items with reckless abandon. Don't think about it.* I recommend four poached eggs and a doughnut.  *Unless you have something to do in the next four hours, besides for nap.",

We called ahead to see if there was a wait, and the person of the phone responded with there's never a wait, but it's a little busy right now. I was curious to know how there is never a wait, and it's because you go up to place your order and then find a seat. Very clever way to handle a rush in my opinion. We tried the Japanese iced coffee and it was really good. I had the tortilla espanola, which was delicious and fluffy like a cake, but savory like an omelet. I also ordered a Portuguese doughnut, which was kinda harder than what I would expect a doughnut to be, it was lightly sweet, so it kind of reminded me of a flattened churro.",

Was told the Portuguese donut wasn't available anymore and was kinda disappointed but when they brought out my food I had to ask if that was it or not. Apparently I lucked out and got it anyhow.   4 stars because of the great tasting food. Solid amount of food to definitely feed you and your girlfriend (bmoc at least).  Come give em a try!

Came in this morning for the amazing biscuits & gravy and had a side of a pancake - delicious as always!  And the coffee - OMG!   One little snag - the water had a funny taste. Mentioned it to the manager, Kaj, and he promptly brought us a bottle of water! Really above what's necessary, but just a sign of the high quality of customer service.

The restaurant opens at 6:30 and I arrive at 6:25 with the doors unlocked. I peaked my head in and asked if they were open. I told, who looked like the owner, I just wanted to grab a cup of coffee. The server snottily replied that they weren't and I need to come back after they opened. I thought five minutes was strange but I went back out to my car. Just as I do that I see three people walk in and get seated for breakfast. So strange.  I have heard the world about their  cold brew and had to try it. The wait staff was so cold even after I told them this was my first time there and to tell me about their coffee selections and menu. I, myself, am a culinary school graduate and a past restaurant owner. Customer service is everything. I ended up settling on a six dollar cup of the worst cold brew I've ever had. It was so bad that I told the man waiting on me that the coffee tasted strange, asked for a different kind and to hold the sweetener. I then walked over to the coffee bar to add my own sugar when I look down and see the entire table covered with ants. They did promptly clean up the table. The cold brew was absolutely disgusting, the customer service was even worse and I won't be going back to try breakfast. So sad.",

    "text": "Great brunch place with a cool southern twist to the traditional american diner brunch food. The cuban benedict daily special tasted more like an open top burger than the traditional eggs benedict. The b.m.o.c was rather large in portion size. I like that the slightly salty smoked pork chop goes very well with the plain waffles and sweet apple-maple syrup. The blend in sweet and salty, as well as the different textures made this a rather well executed dish.  Their special Japanese ice coffee was also rather tasty, and definitely did the job of giving me the caffeine kick I needed!",

    "text": "So I've lived downtown for over a year now but only just now got around to trying this place for the first time.  Yeah, I know, fail on my part.  But better late than never.  I've always loved Tuck Shop and found out the same owners also run this little breakfast place.  So up early on a Sunday morning I decided to venture in.  I wandered in by myself right at opening.  The restaurant is packed into a cluster of restaurants on the southeast corner of 7th Ave & McDowell.  You can enter from the courtyard patio area on the west or the parking lot on the east.  The interior is cute and comfortable with enough seating for probably around 40-50 people, though it still has the feel of a small tucked away place.  There's a couple of counter areas inside.  One looks like it was strictly for selling their in-house Mornin Moonshine coffee brand.  The main counter is where you put in your order.  No waiter service here as you just order your meal at the main counter and find seating on your own.  Easy enough for me since I was by myself and the bulk of the morning crowd didn't stream in till later.  Looking through Yelp and perusing the menu, the BMOC seems to be the star here so I decided to give that a whirl.  Meal came out to me about 10 minutes after I ordered.  Long story short, this is a breakfast that eats like a dinner.  The layers from bottom to top are as follows:  Waffle, smoked pork chop, apple maple syrup (with actual diced apples), 2 eggs (any style you want), and a fried donut with powdered sugar.  I can promise you won't go home hungry after eating this.  Lots of flavor in this thing.  I especially loved the apple syrup as it helps mellow the smoke flavor of the pork chop and goes excellent with the waffle.  The pork chop itself is well cooked and hearty, though the smokiness of the pork chop might have been a little bit overpowering for my taste.  But overall, good solid chop.  The best way to attack this dish in my humble opinion is to try and get a fork full of all 5 layers at the same time.  You get a little of everything.  Total tab for the BMOC as well as an OJ came to about $15.  Pretty reasonable for the amount of food I got.  I think next time I come here I might give the Mexican Benedict or the Johnnycakes a try.  Overall a pretty solid and unique breakfast and brunch option downtown.  My first experience wasn't perfect, but more than worthy of another visit (and next time it won't be a year in the making).",

As we placed our order, the man taking our order walked away mid-sentence for 2 full minutes with no explanation or reasoning given to us. After we got through placing our order, we were told to go stand by the wall and the manager would seat us. About 90 seconds later a man walked over and just said \"Seat?\" to us. We said yes and were seated at a table that was halfway in the walkway from the kitchen. Due to this, both kitchen staff and customers who had just placed orders bumped into the back of my chair and head constantly. In the end, we won't be returning. Not due to the food, which was very good, but the service and environment were too strenuous to entice a return visit unfortunately.",

I didn't mind standing in line knowing I was going to be ordering at the end of it, and loved how they made sure tables weren't occupied until you had a number for your food. It really kept people moving without worrying about holding a table. Loved their patio seating too.  I had a really hard time deciding what to eat because there were so many delicious sounding, and looking (yes, I was that person creeping on other's breakfasts as we were standing in line). I finally settled on their biscuits and gravy because that's one of my favorite breakfast foods- it was so delicious!! Definitely want to try their Mexican benedict next time I'm in town.  Loved their Japanese cold-brewed coffee as well! Smooth, rich and totally hit the spot!  The owner, I think, was working the register when we ordered and he was so friendly and welcoming- that kind of attention goes a long way. I will definitely be back!",

I've been here a good handful of times and tried something different from the menu each time.  My favorite so far is either the Mexican Benedict or the Banging Pocket. Each has its merits.   This gem is from the same folks that brought us Tuck Shop and Astor House. The same staff from what I remember from Astor house, even, if I remember correctly. Everyone is super friendly regardless.  Just one more reason to love breakfast. Thanks Vovomeena!",

The place is set back into a little courtyard, so the outside seating is pretty relaxed with no cars whizzing by or anything.  This is a popular place, for sure - for good reason.  So prepare for a wait.  It's the type of place where you walk in, grab a menu, and stand in line to order - then they bring you the food after you order.  I've always been a fan of that style, so when you're done eating, you just leave, but it took so long that I was wishing I could just relax at a table instead of standing in line for over 30 minutes, but whatever.  I loved the menu.  Short but sweet with creative breakfast options.  So many things I wanted to try.  I loved the biscuits and gravy.  Coffee was meh - made in mass quantity instead of to order.  My girlfriend liked her breakfast, but didn't love it.  We'll be back...",

The main thing that keeps me from going back more often is that the food is generally very heavy, and the menu doesn't have the flexibility one usually expects with breakfast. For instance, you can get bangers in the one dish that features them, but not as an option in place of the breakfast links that come with one or two other dishes. No building your own breakfast here. The menu hasn't changed in the few years since they opened, so things are pretty much set in stone.",

Not that doctored up stuff from the can that other places like to pass as \"homemade!\", nicely poached eggs and fluffy biscuits! The coffee was great, service was good, the only complaint I have was the food was not that hot.  Grab a menu at the end of the rope wall and pick your passion by ordering at the counter. Fast and friendly service is waiting for you here so check them out!  Second time I had the Banging Pocket and it was a flavor explosion (does all that sound right?)! Piping hot and a nice fluffy pita, can't beat this thing, I was full half way through, but kept on eating.  Check this place out for sure as its a hidden gem in Phoenix!!",

The inflated price, inconsistent quality of food, and terrible staff has driven me away.  This all started about 1 month ago..  I took my family here, gloating about how this would change their opinion of how breakfast should taste.  Well after getting my order(b.m.o.c) wrong, and then giving me the biscuits and gravy, they served my family(they were a separate ticket) and then gave me another order of biscuits and gravy, which was still wrong..  I brought this up with my waiter, who then promptly said he would make it right and return with my b.m.o.c..  Sadly another employee showed up at our table, leaned over with her elbows on our table and started reading over a ticket..  She then looked menacingly at our table and walked away while scoffing.  About 15 minutes later, the saddest pork chop covered by a waffle, with an over cooked egg sat in front of me.  Not only was the presentation wrong, but the pork chop looked anemic and obviously was not of the same standard that I had before.  So I ate my food and left, never looking back.  Sorry Vovemeena, but you aren't the first place to lose a customer over terrible front of house workers.",

Running out of eggs...... send one of your hipsters to the damn store to buy more!  Do your eggs come from special Vovomeena chickens?? I'm pretty sure I'd be OK with some store bought organic eggs. Like I said, food is excellent, that's why we come here. Straighten up your inconsistencies please",

A lifelong Phoenix resident took me here and swore by it, so I came with an open mind despite a difficult parking situation in the small attached lot. Upon entering you wait in line to place your order and I chose the biscuits and gravy as well as the unlimited hot coffee before taking our seat.   The coffee itself was great and worthy of any boutique coffee shop in LA! While I got the unlimited hot coffee (for only $3!) my friend got the cold brew sampler which was a unique experience if you're a cold brew lover! Out of her four cold brews she really liked three of them, so don't go into it planning to love each one but if you want to try new things it's a great option.  When our food arrived I was blown away by the biscuits and gravy. As many here have said, they're incredibly rich and indulgent but are the perfect treat if you're craving something heavy on the carbs and cream! The menu is expansive, as well, so next time I'm in Phoenix I'll certainly come back to try something new!",

The atmosphere is also great, relaxed and beautifully decorated. I love that one can see the exposed supplies, ingredients, and other items in the back of house.

    "text": "We stumbled on this place via yelp, when we looked for an open breakfast place when we arrived in Arizona for a vacation. Our flight came in early. We found this, was not totally easy to find (blame it on the GPS) but when we did, we were in for a surprise. The place is hip, the food was great, and the service is exceptional. There were food choices that were among things I was not familiar with so I was willing to try out. We ordered 2 different items. They came out really well, except that I am not a big fan of waffles and, well, I ordered waffles. It was a little too sweet, being that it was mixed with some compote or apple-something. Otherwise, it was good. Outside of food, the service was great. The manager and food server were there helping us out as we figured where to go on our visit. You cant find that easily elsewhere-- staff members, who are willing to talk to you.  Do check this place out if you want good food and wonderful people in AZ!",

I'm ok with smaller portions but this really was stretching it especially for $9.  Same for the Pain Perdu.

It's an order then sit down place which works pretty well unless there's a group like the 5 of us trying to make up our minds. Sorry everyone! I was tempted by many offerings but  but I got the BMOC which has a porkchop that was smoked and heaven \"scent\" on a waffle with eggs on top of that and a Portuguese donut - I shared this meal with the 3 year old because it is enormous! Hubby got the waffle, son in law got the chorizo egg special, daughter got a tortilla espanola --the meats are superb and come from Schreiner's - I tried the sausage and it had a little spicyness to it and was everything you hope for. It was hard to engage in a conversation because everyone was oohing and ahhin over their breakfast. We loved the flavor of the home fried potatoes too! The donut was light and not like True Malasada's but great for a regular donut. And the baby ate EVERYTHING! I also had a latte and my daughter a cappuccino. This is a great local place with an excellent combo of breakfast AND great coffee -- I don't recall Matt's Big Breakfast offering lattes do you? BONUS! -- we didn't have to wait an hour! This is a great little place -- try it -- you'll like it!",

It's simple with a twist. I'll be back and this time I'm going for the tortilla espanola!",

    "text": "I went here based on a yelp review and enjoyed my experience.   First, the decor is very charming and modern. The place has great ambiance and the people that work there seemed genuinely nice.   Second, coffee was amazing! I'm a bit of a coffee snob and chose this place over Matt's Big Breakfast based solely on the rave coffee reviews. Best $2 I ever spent on a cup of joe. It's pour-over quality coffee reminiscent of Blue Bottle Coffee Co. in San Francisco.   Third, the food was pretty good. In our group of three we got the pancakes, potatoes and choice of meat, the savory crepes and the pain perdu.  The pancakes, potatoes and sausage my friend got were average. I tried her potatoes which were my favorite part of her meal.  The crepes were....interesting...but in a good way, like when you first try something and you're not sure you'll like it, so you keep eating, intrigued, and then you decide that this is really good though perhaps more like something you crave every once in a while than something you'd eat regularly....bit of stream of consciousness for you...the pain perdu was too much too sweet....it's a banana bread pudding topped with a sweet and salty, thick caramel sauce and fresh banana slices....you get two brownie-sized squares of it with a side of bacon....I hated that my crunchy bacon was covered in the caramel sauce....I enjoyed this meal because the bread is not sweet, but super sweetened by the caramel sauce...it's just too much for breakfast and would be better if they reduced the portion size of the bread pudding and added some eggs or potatoes....my tummy felt queezy after such a sweet meal...glad my friends shared their meals to portion mine out.   The menu's knid of limited, but I think it keeps the place original. I'd definitely recommend and maybe even return just to sit and sip their delicious coffee.",

Since we were a bigger party, someone helped us grab a table after a few minutes of waiting to the side.  I had the Mexican Benedict, which was delicious but with the sopes and spuds, was a little too much carb for me.  My iced latte with almond milk was perfect!   My friends had the bangers and the tortilla Espanola which they enjoyed as well.  My vegan friend was also able to find some options and they helped my friend with her two-year-old with an egg option on the side.  The service was prompt, even considering how busy they were at the time.  We all enjoyed brunch and i will definitely be back!",

Overall, it's a great breakfast place.  The food is delicious and something different from your usual egg benedict and pancakes.  We got the boxty and grillades which was delicious.  It did take a while for us to get our food and the set up is a bit confusing.  It's counter service so you'll need to order first and then find a place to sit.  Also, if you order coffee, you need to go to the coffee counter to pick it up.  Once you get the hang of it, it's a pleasant brunch experience.  The Japanese coffee was good as well.",

If the server would of told us in a nice way maybe we would of stayed but when you are waiting  in  a line with  a car seat they should of at least acknowledged that since it's open seating but the server rudely told u its first come first serve.

Although, it is not very classy and upscale place, the menu and coffee is really good.  Arrived later in the morning for good seating.  It is very popular.  I wonder why?   Their BMOC is a special dish; they were out when we ordered. But it gets rave reviews. Not to worry, there are many good choices on the menu.  Very frustrating when you want to order almost everything on the menu.  Their Japanese cold-brewed coffee is also a special attraction.  Nothing quite like it.  You order and find a seat.  They bring food to your table.  Parking is a little tight in that area.",

They ask you not to barney a table until you've ordered and believe it or not the system works.    Waiting in line to order you can see them preparing the food; yummy.  Small menu but choices I've not seen elsewhere. I got the tortilla espanola and the hubby got the mexican benedict.  Both were cooked well and were tasty.  Not earth shattering but good.  When they dropped our breakfasts they asked if we wanted condiments and it took him a full 5 minutes (while the breakfast cooled) before he came back with them.  I'd suggest they carry the items on their person - only complaint.",

A few key elements set Vovomeena as the bar for us: 1. quaint menu, quality ingredients, presentation {we've tried 75% of the breakfast menu- all excellent, but we keep coming back to the Pain Perdu & Mexican Eggs Benedict}; 2. friendly & familiar faces : the staff at Vovomeena stick around. It's nice to recognize faces behind the counter & in the kitchen. It doesn't have to be an \"everybody knows your name\" kind of place to feel just welcoming enough; 3. location & atmosphere. It's nestled in a perfect location just off I-10; to add, the outdoor seating is lovely & indoor decor & 'space' gives a great vibe even for family dining (we usually need 2 highchairs at our table).  Thank you, Vovomeena, for a consistent, thoughtful & enjoyable dining experience in the Valley!",

The pain perdu is an absolute must. Banana syrupy goodness! I can't break away from the original eggs-potatoes-bacon / sausage breakfast - it's so nice when a restaurant gets it right! (The jam..get the jam.)   Indoor / outdoor seating. Take a menu off the wall and order with the cashier near the kitchen.",

I decided to go with Yelp's recommendations of the BMOC.  This thing was insane!  A waffle, then a pork chop, two eggs, maple syrup and some kind of fruit, and just as a little \"cherry on top\" for your breakfast sundae, they give you a small donut hole with some powder.    It was quite tasty!  However, it was too much for me to take.  It would practically take two of me to finish it all. Luckily, I was set to hike Squaw Peak right after.  So I didn't feel too guilty getting down with that kind of breakfast.  It actually gave me the extra motivation and boost of energy I needed.   On a side note, the iced coffee was a little too strong for my blood.  I'm sure other coffee drinkers would love it.",

We drove over 20 miles to specifically to eat here.  Coffee is excellent too and very unique: I love their variety of cold drips.   The big negative (or a positive spending on your perspective) is that this place is too NOISY! This is primarily why I am giving 3/5 stars. If it wasn't so stinking loud in here I would easily give 4-4.5 stars.",

You order at the counter first, then wait for the manager to seat you. Between the three of us we ordered the Mexican eggs Benedict, pain perdu (French toast), kid's egg/bacon/pancake, fresh oj, and a Portuguese doughnut.   Let's start out with the reason I will come back... the Portuguese doughnut was one of the best doughnuts I've ever had! You'll find it on the bottom of the menu, \"add a Portuguese doughnut to your order (duh!) 1.50\". Well said guys! Get one!   Second on the list is the pain perdu which my hubby ordered. He would only share two bites and I was reluctantly understanding. I wouldn't have wanted to share it either! I was a little disappointed with the chorizo on my Benedict. It was overly greasy and a little spicy for me (just preference).   Worth a try friend!",

In Hawaii, there are these little donuts called malasadas but they are technically Portuguese donuts and they are amazing. So I was hoping to get something close at Vovomeena. I didn't but overall my experience was still good.  The boyfriend and I went early on a Saturday so it wasn't very busy. We looked around lost and confused for a moment until someone came up to us and told us the drill - order at counter and they bring it to your table. I went basic - eggs and bacon, boyfriend went for the French toast and of course we ordered two donuts.  The food came out pretty quickly and the portions were large. My food was good but nothing unbelievable. Boyfriend liked his French toast - it was very dense and heavy so if you're looking for something light, the French toast is not. (I know French toast is not usually a \"light\" item - I'm just sayin' this was exceptionally heavy.) As excited as we were about the donuts, we were kinda let down. They tasted more like funnel cake than donuts - greasy and heavy.   The staff was nice, the food was okay but I don't think we'll go out of our way to go here again.",

Just put a pitcher of syrup on my table, please.  Extra syrup could not render the pancakes finish-able.  The potatoes were also likewise very dry.  I only finished the bacon.  I didn't order, since I was the birthday guest, but it looks like you order your food and coffee at separate counters.  Is that the case?  And if so, is that necessary?  Do I really want to stand in 2 lines for my breakfast?  No.  I don't even want to stand in one line.  Unless that line is at Matt's.  Around 11:00, the music got so loud I had trouble hearing my friends talking.  And there were a LOT of kids there, if you're into that thing.  Also, I have had TERRIBLE reflux all day.

Smoked pork chop topped with a waffle, two fried eggs and a Portuguese donut all smothered in apple maple syrup. I was full about 2/3 of the way through this madness but  finished like a champ. 3 cups of coffee later I was able to avoid the food coma but I was still stuffed from breakfast around 8pm that same day. Give it a go homey!",

The food is wonderful, and the decor is just as wonderful. The parking, however, is impossible after 10am. Go early.  The kitchen area is a little disorganized and disheveled, but the kitchen staff manages to crank out quality and good tasting dishes at a good pace.    I'll definitely be back. The food and service is superior. I'll just avert my eyes next time I'm standing towards the kitchen. OK I'm lying: I always look and cannot stop.",

    "text": "Got the boxty, a jar of coffee (refillable at 10% off), and the day's special lemon tart. The food came out super fast and it was so good. Pancake-sized boxty (2) with shredded apple and a sweet butter on top, paired with two thick-cut slices of bacon.  It's set up where you grab a menu off the wall and go down the line to order at the end. You can see the cooks working without a glass barrier as you stand in line - so don't sneeze.  If you order a jar of coffee at the food counter, the coffee counter further into the restaurant gets a ticket so you pick it up there. It's a plastic-lidded mason jar with a custom label and is filled from jugs in the fridge. It fills about 4 of the ice-filled tumblers/plastic to-go cups and it totally worth the $10. It's super smooth and tasty and not at all bitter. I barely had to put anything into it; I could definitely drink it black and I usually can't with coffee. The boxty was much larger than I expected and the potato vs. sweet apple flavour was distinct from each other and very complimentary, rather than one overpowering the other. The bacon was super tasty too.  The lemon tart was small and plain but still pretty good. I'm not sure what other offerings they have since it said it was the day's \"special\" offering. They also had cookies on the counter and a little cooler of bottled drinks and orange juice at the check out.  A filling breakfast with amazing coffee for just over $20! I will definitely be back!  PS. All the people writing reviews and complaining about lack of vegan choices - there are other restaurants that cater to your special, self-imposed diet. Never, ever expect people to cater to you. It's such a stupid reason to criticize a public place.",

    "text": "One of the other Yelpers mentioned this place was like the restaurant from the \"Brunch Village\" episode from Portlandia and they were absolutely right! Phoenix has its version of \"Fisherman's Porch\" and it does what it does well.  That being said, this place is not for everyone. If you are not gastro-venturous and willing to pay for being so, then this is probably not your scene.  I was actually happy to find that I literally beat the crowd Sat around 11am (there was absolutely no one in line when I placed my order and the second I was handed my number there was a line out the door..,?). They have an interesting service setup here, which again, only works for a place like this. It is quasi-counter service in that you order at the counter and are given a number and afterwards can choose your seat. They also have a coffeebar, where you see the japanese cold brew drips hourglassing above, where you can pick up your ordered beverages. Based on your number, your food is brought to your table.  I ordered the mexican benedict (warning, the sauce and chorizo do have a somewhat spicy kick to them) which was delicious. The potatoes in other reviews were mentioned as \"mushy\" but I did not find them to be so. They were not as crispy as they could have been, but definitely leaned towards the cooked rather than soft side. I also loved that they have a \"coffee flight\" of their japanese cold brews. The ones I sampled were the \"straight\", vanilla cocao, and an lemon jalapeno. The latter was the only one I did not care for. I could have had a full serving of the vanilla cocoa as the density of the coffee balanced out the sweetness of the flavoring and was just perfection!   I ended my meal with a portuguese donut, which is, imho, the lovechild of a beignet and indian fry bread, and I will say, their offspring was exquisitely delicious!  The space itself was great and I loved the rustic contempo decor. The patio seating area is a kind of shared space w/the entrance to the courtyard of the little shopping center they occupy. Parking is a little limted, but thankfully I didn't have any issues finding a space.  All in all, a fantastic experience and should I ever find myself in the downtown area (or short drive from Sky Harbor) again, I will make a detour.",

    "text": "Great brunch place and not as expensive as what you would find in New York! My recommendations are the Johnnycakes and the b.m.o.c.  Johnnycakes (Two corn and chile cakes, prickly pear maple syrup, sweet rice) - My favorite of what we ordered. The cakes tasted like thin crispy cornbread with whole corn kernels throughout the pancake. The syrup was on the flowery side. Add a side of potatoes and this was a perfect breakfast.  b. m. o. c. (Massive Smoked Pork Chop, waffle, 2 eggs, Portuguese donut) - The waffle itself was soggy, but the pork chop was juicy and massive as advertised. It was similar to ham and it combined well with apple compote. The donut tasted like a fried fritter. I recommend ordering this.  Pain Perdu (Banana bread pudding french toast, whiskey caramel) - The banana bread was too sweet and too soggy. The whiskey caramel added more unnecessary sweetness. Order this only if you have a huge sweet tooth. I loved the crispy side of potatoes though.   Biscuits and Gravy (Buttermilk Biscuit, Hector's White Sausage Gravy, Two Eggs - The sausage had a somewhat spicy kick. Biscuits were fluffy. Eat this dish while warm because the gravy becomes too thick and viscous.  Order at the cash register and they'll bring you the food to the table. To get drinks, order/retrieve them from the drinks counter. Overall, I enjoyed this place and if I lived here I would frequent this place often.",

The prices were adorable and the portions were decent size for the affordable price.  I ordered the Waffle, Bacon and Potatoes and at $8.95 it was priced accordingly.  It was yummy, real maple syrup would be a good addition vs. the corn syrup buttersworth/jemima one they served.

The flavor is amazing and I loved the texture (tender inside like a buttermilk pancake with a crispy exterior). The fresh strawberries and syrup was fantastic with it. The sweet rice was a cinnamon rice pudding that was good, but an odd addition to the cakes.  Mexican Benedict ($10.95): Poached eggs, chorizo, tomato, cilantro, hollandaise on sopes with spuds. I just love variations of the traditional benedict and this one really hit the mark for me. The sopes were wonderful and such a great alternative to the English muffin. Obviously, chorizo is always great and it worked really well here; also, its spice was toned down a bit by the hollandaise. The spuds were tasty, too.  You order and pay at the counter and then grab a table. The menu is fun; I definitely have my eye on other items for another visit, however, those Johnnycakes are a must again! Fantastic service.",

    "text": "My friends and I needed to find a good restaurant on our way to Phoenix Comic Fest in May 2018. We decided to try this place, and we were amazed by the fresh food and excellent staff. We would recommend the pancakes and biscuits and gravy. Although, we were even impressed by the toast and jam with eggs, and the chorizo was just perfect. The coffee is the best we have tasted, and we ended up returning for breakfast for the following day of the fest. Next time I visit, I will bring my family and friends. I cannot wait to try other items on the menu. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

The only one was right about their door, but you can't see it well from the street. We got lost and drove around and couldn't find it. I had to text my sister to see where it's at.   I ordered the banging pocket which I didn't think was very banging. Lol. It comes with sausage and eggs wrapped in a pita with a side of potatoes. It would've been nice with some onions or mushrooms or something. It just wasn't anything great.   There isn't a lot of seating at the restaurant. You probably have to come early to get a table or you'll end up sitting outside in the hot weather. They should really install misters. The service was really good but it was a far drive for mediocre food.",

    "text": "We stumbled upon this place while searching for some breakfast/lunch places in Phoenix. This place was pretty busy upon entering. There were only a couple of tables open. The food was amazing. The biscuits and gravy were top notch. The biscuits were soft yet had a crispy texture, and the gravy was creamy and had delicious sausage pieces in it. The all-you-can-drink coffee was very good. It didn't taste like cheap drip coffee. It was bold and full-bodied and went very well with our food.   The environment was nice in that the doors were open to a nice patio area with outdoor seating. The only thing is that you can't sit where you want. You have to wait until after your order and then they find a table for you. A positive for this method is that you don't have to scramble to find an open table (like you do at In-N-Out!).   We will definitely return to try the other items on the menu. So many menu items that sounded so good. But they are a bit pricey for breakfast, so we can't return very often.",

This place was bookmarked a while ago and it has 4.5 stars so we decided to give it a try.   The place was a bit hidden for us since we didn't see it from the street. Parking seems to be limited but we didn't have trouble getting a spot.   It's a quick place for breakfast/brunch. You order at the counter, get a number display and you grab a table. I went with the Savory Crepes - they were just okay. Nothing stood out and I wished I had ordered the orchard french toast that I was eyeballin on the menu. It wasn't that it was bad, it was just so plain. Maybe it was my sweet tooth that made me feel guilty.  My sister went with the banging pocket (I think that was what it was called). She said it was enjoyable but also was not impressed. She did enjoy the fresh squeezed orange juice and I managed to steal a few sips of it. Not a bad way to start a Friday after a funeral service. No complaints about the food and service was quick & friendly.",

There are a few parking spaces in the back lot near the Easley's Fun House side.   As most popular brunch places, coming on a Sunday afternoon, this place was extremely packed. They have 2 entrances front and back. It can be confusing if you entered from the back since no sign or service directing you until you walked to the front seeing a long waiting line.   You place the order and paid at the counter then they bring the food to your table. You can watch them preparing the food while you order. It's an open kitchen. They do have outside seating area shared with other businesses.   I tried the special eggs Benedict on board and the Japanese cold brew. It was a basic hearty meal but nothing special. The Japanese cold brew was just ok. It didn't fully capture the coffee flavors that I am used to in a Japanese cold brew. Their Portuguese donut was decent but I felt overpriced ($1.50 for a really small piece).  Overall, it's great little place in a vibrant changing neighborhood.",

First impression was that I lucked up on finding the place but  Vovomeena is such a cute little restaurant. It's family friendly with plenty of parking.  When I arrived the line was flowing out of the door (which explained why no one could answer the phone). A long line of happy people is always a good sign. I stood in line reading the menu for a few minutes but I already knew what I wanted to order. Once I made it in the door I noticed what I assumed was the manager running back and forth and being very welcoming to guests. In fact, it seemed that all the staff did equal work but the gentleman who stood out just seemed like the one who made sure everyone was happy.  So I stopped him and told him I wanted to order take out. He led me over to another section of the restaurant where I put my order before waiting a short while for my food. The service and food (orchard French toast, turkey sausage and hasbrowns) were great! I highly recommend this wonderful neighborhood jewel.",

    "text": "We have become brunch lovers so it was exciting to see unique menu options at Vovomeena. The have a convenient setup so when patrons get there, they can get in line and order prior to being seated. While it's not the biggest restaurant, we were able to order & get seated immediately at one of the tables outside. Our food came out in just a short while.  I chose the 3 Sisters Omelette & my husband chose the Banging Pocket. It was nice that multiple menu options were served with your choice of bacon, sausage, or potatoes. When we were in line, we had the full view of the kitchen; I had seen them cooking up potatoes and they looked delicious so I got those as my side with the Omelette!  My husband loved the Banging Pocket which came with the potatoes. It was a pretty sizeable breakfast but he was able to eat the whole thing. The Omelette was tasty with the black beans, corn, zucchini, & cheese. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the feta that was on top. It felt like there was too much & the strong flavor of the cheese overpowered the others flavors. The Banging Pocket came with a side of salsa which I actually think would've gone well with the omelette as well. I'd ask for that next time ... and no feta!  If I were looking for something different, I'd come back to Vovomeena. It probably wouldn't be my #1 choice but there are other options they offer which I'd like to try!",

I expected to have to wait a long time to order and get a table but surprisingly they were pretty quick about it. You enter the cafe and grab a menu to start, you get in line and order with the cashier and if you ordered coffee you will get it from the coffee bar. The barista was very quick and the cold brew was amazing. I added sweet Italian cream that was available as well as a little simple syrup. We waited in the line to be sat for maybe 3-4 minutes then the host sat us. The food came just as quickly, I ordered the egg sandwich without bacon as I am a vegetarian. It was very good!! The chipotle aioli really hit the spot. I would definitely come back here.",

    "text": "Vovomeena. A good.. ish place.  I say ish because my experience here was unique. It was good. And bad. And awkward.  We arrived later in the afternoon. I work in service so I won't go anywhere with less than 30 mins to close. Anyways. We arrived with around 40 mins to close and the man at the counter, I believe a manager? Or supervisor idk he had keys to lock up.  I have some diet restrictions and needed some walk thru the menu. He was pretty helpful. But idk I just got like an annoyed attitude like he would rather be anywhere else kinda vibe. Which is understandable I tots get it. No one really enjoys working, but fake it till you make it right brah?!  Anywho after that things were chill. I got my food. Pretty good. Fresh. Cooked well. Tasty. You can tell that someone is invested and cares about the quality of their establishment.  But it's not really something I'd write home to mah about. The decor on another hand is really cute and the colors compliment one another. I also really enjoyed their art on the wall. You could tell that it was original and probably made by a local artist. Paintings of facial portraits. The ocean. Some Picasso shit. It was cool to look at. My friend got the special. A burrito of some sorts. And it comes with fruit. It was fresh honeydew and it looked so good that I couldn't help but start to crave. They were closing up it was like 1:20 at this point so I walked up to the counter and asked for some fruit to go. The OG guy again helped out and started to offer to box up the rest of the melon when the chica stated \"tengo hombre\". OG immediately started to say that actually they were going to use the melon for a special tomorrow, or whatever BS he came up with on the spot   Now to give you a picture, I'm a white girl. Like a basic white bitch. A full on gringa. But I know some Spanish and I know that means \"I'm hungry\".  And I said \"oh that's cool. She's  hungry, I understand I like fruit too\" and walked back to my table. Bitch stole mi fruta  Then I went back to get a box for my leftovers and I heard him speaking to the server assistant dude telling him what happened and laughing   I mean it's a funny ass story. The dude was probably just over worked and tired; and the chica was just getting off of work and hungry. I get it.   But it was terrible customer service. Will not come back. And will not recommend.",

    "text": "2019 Update a year later.    I've been in a few times since my last update.    And I must say things have not gone well.   For the last year I've suggested this place to many especially for the biscuits and gravy.  I can no longer do that.    I ordered the biscuits and gravy with side order of bacon.   And it wasn't anything like it used to be.  Where was the white gravy with big chunks of sausage and big biscuit ?!  This time The gravy was sour with very small  pieces of sausage and was a brownish/yellowish color (the super yellow in the pic is egg yolk) I ordered bacon which was flacid no crispness at all.  This was nothing like I remembered.  It looked like a plate throw up.   See pic.  Which is funny because even though i only had a few bites but couldn't get 3 miles away before having to pull the car over and throw up.  I did mention the sourness to someone in the coffee area as I was leaving. He offered to get me a free meal ticket.   Which I declined, as I will no longer put my stomach through this.     For over $17 for biscuits and gravy 2 eggs , 2 slices of bacon and coffee the only redeeming factor was the coffee.  But definitely NOT worth the $17       Previous update: Manager asked us to come out and try it again.    This time was so much better, coffee was as great as ever. Food was great.  My dad loved his meal. People were so friendly.    I appreciate that they put the eggs on the side (instead of on pancakes). Without even being asked.  Now if they could just get more comfortable seating...dad (79 yrs old) (no padding on his butt) and I (with back issues) both had troubles getting up from the hard metal chairs.   But I'll just bring cushions next time. Lol",

They had a special latte - the Thin Mint latte - and it was everything you'd think it would be and more. It even came with a thin mint on the side. The Pain Perdu banana bread french toast was pretty heavy and sweet, but was really delicious! I'd recommend splitting that with someone and getting something more savory as your main meal if you don't like overly sweet dishes. The atmosphere inside is cozy and cool. Will be back!",

    "text": "The banana nut muffins taste like Cap'n Crunch! Their muffins are baked with love. Soft, moist, fresh and flavorful.   3.5 Star review.  I've seen nothing but great reviews and recommendations for this breakfast joint.  It was quite busy the morning I came - looked like some business meetings even took place here. A wait was understood but the lines died out and it got to a point where we thought they forgot about us. When I went to check on my table's order, the guy at the counter let me know that it would be right out. And it did come to us within the next couple minutes. Everyone was super apologetic and a gentleman (perhaps a manager? Owner?) even came by and checked up on us, apologized, and gave us three muffins on the house. Such a kind and appreciated gesture - not to mention those muffins are fantastic! Might even be the best thing we had on the menu!   I ordered the classic egg sandwich. The bread was really soft and you can never go wrong with eggs and bacon. Overall I enjoyed my sandwich. I would order it again.   My boyfriend ordered the Wilcox Avenue which was just eggs, a choice of meat, and toast. Again, simple, he also enjoyed his food with some Tapatio.   My brother and his girlfriend on the other hand did not have too pleasant of a breakfast. He got the Blackstone Scramble, which he said was barely seasoned and had an overwhelming amount of bell peppers.. And she ordered the Mexican Benedict. She is a lover of all Benedict's. That is, until today. The chorizo was not very flavorful. Again, the meal was just pretty bland and the eggs were over poached. There was such high expectations as everyone raves over them but it did not deliver in the least bit.   It made sense why my boyfriend and I were happy with our meals because what we ordered doesn't require seasoning.   What really made me disappointed were the spuds that are served with every meal. Now, I don't know if it's a thing to just kind of boil potatoes and call it good but I was not a fan! The amount of time we waited I feel like they should've sat on the stove top a little longer to get at least a crisp if there's absolutely no flavors added. Not even copious amounts of pepper or ketchup could save those.  Aside from that - if I were around the area, I would probably stop in for a muffin and some tea or coffee.",

I had the classic egg sandwich with potatoes on the side and he had the Blackstone scramble with a flour tortilla on the side. I tasted the scramble and the tortilla, both tasted homemade and delicious. The egg sandwich exceeded expectations. I love Eggslut sandwiches, but the Vovomeena sandwich now holds first place for me. I will definitely be returning whenever we're in town again.  Tl;dr: service was fast, food tasted homemade and delicious.",

I think I would have been decently pleased with myself had I made it at home, but for the price...? Not worth it. The significant other had Wilcox Avenue, which was eggs, potatoes and a biscuit. Again, all quite bland. I think the best thing we had to say about the meal was how crispy the outside of the potatoes were.  Upsides: Ambience was really cool. Service was decent. They let you help yourself to water. So, you know, not all bad.",

    "text": "I only tried two dishes here, but I felt like both were extremely heavy. In glancing through the menu, it seemed that most of the dishes bordered on the heavy, carb-full side of brunch. Not that there's anything wrong with that, and brunch food tends to be heavy in general, but I felt that Vovomeena definitely took that to a new extreme with the dishes I tried. They were very unbalanced, and I didn't feel like finishing the meal after a few bites because of how one-dimensional the flavors felt.   Vovomeena is located in a small plaza with a shared parking lot between a few restaurants. Parking can be insane during the lunchtime rush, but it's not usually too hard to find a spot. Tables felt somewhat sticky to me, and unfortunately there were quite a few flies hovering around (not that that's the restaurant's fault). The mechanism is order first at the counter, grab drinks as they're made at the counter, and then find self seating. Service at the counter was short, although the waiter manning the tables was nice and checked on us a few times.  Iced cold brew: This was a far cry from the fragrant, nutty cold brew coffee that the menu promised. I much prefer the Starbucks cold brew even, and this was very watered down and bland in comparison. The cup was also half ice, which I wasn't a fan of.  HMOC: waffle topped with pork loin and donut. This combination was very interesting, and I hadn't really had anything like it before. My main issue with this dish, as I've mentioned above, is how it was heavy upon heavy upon heavy. The waffle was sweet and syrupy, then on top the pork loin was salty and dense (it tasted more like ham so I was surprised), and finally there's a fried donut on top that was also very rich. I felt that there wasn't a component to alleviate some of the richness of the dish, so it was hard to enjoy after the first few bites. I actually preferred that the pork had been cured or marinated before, as the saltiness similar to ham could combat the sweetness of the waffle and donut a little.   Pain Perdu: I know this is a Yelp favorite, but it was really just banana bread smothered in syrup. There wasn't really anything that suggested french toast to me, and paying $10+ for two slices of banana bread soaked in syrup with half a sliced banana on top didn't feel worth it to me. The banana bread was also really, really sweet, which was then exacerbated by the syrup on top. The whole dish was so sweet that it made the banana taste bland.   I was lured in by the amazing reviews, but I don't know that I'd return for a second visit.",

    "text": "First off, I spent a great deal of time trying to figure out just what in the hell Vovomeena is supposed to mean. To me, it sounds like the name of some badly designed budget-friendly economy car model from the 90s that was plagued with mechanical problems and ultimately had to be recalled due to safety issues. Unfortunately, I was wrong. It's actually named after the owner's grandmother, so that's that.  We've visited Vovomeena a couple of times, with a good two-year gap in-between both stops. The place has both indoor and outdoor seating and is going for the cafe-styled order at the counter approach. Be warned that if you're visiting later in the day, they will inevitably be out of something - which has happened to us on both occasions.   From what I've experienced, you're fine playing it safe with something like the Willcox Avenue, which consists of your traditional eggs, meat choice (bacon in our case), and a biscuit or toast - although it can be swapped out with a pancake if you wish. The plate also includes spuds, which are potato slices that are only very lightly cooked and served up in pretty small portions. However, everything is very good quality.  If you want to get a bit crazy, go with the B.M.O.C., which consists of a waffle that's topped with a pork chop, two eggs, and a Portuguese donut. The combination is something that people will either love or loathe, depending on how your brain is wired. Personally, I thought it was good, but a bit too heavy on the stomach for someone like myself. I'm glad I tried it, but I doubt I'd order it again.  Vovomeena seems to have its fair share of fans. When studying the menu, they clearly have a nice balance of both unique creations and traditional items that isn't overwhelming. Although I doubt I'd ever put it into regular rotation, it's worth visiting on those Sunday mornings when I'm in the mood to do some brunch experimentation.  Recommended!",

The coffee was unique, against the wall were glass cylinders that dripped coffee slowly into larger cylinders.  I was told this is the new wave of coffee making.  Okay, then I need a cup right now...  I coffee was good, not great but good.  Here comes the brunch.... my husband ordered the French toast... wow.... it was definitely delicious!

Saw this place advertised in the Sunday paper and decided to try it out. My boyfriend at the time and I went and the place was packed which is usually a good sign. However, given the size and arrangement of the restaurant it was very uncomfortable waiting on a line that seemed to be a bit all over the place and confusing to some newcomers such as ourselves. We waited on line for several minutes with the hope that the food should be awesome and worth the wait and hassle. I'm not looking at the menu but I think he got the Perdu something or other (one of there best dish items) and I had the biscuits and gravy. We were extremely underwhelmed. His dish was burnt and my dish tasted only like sage only. I would give the place one star after the long wait and the overly hyped food but decided to give it two because I don't remember the place being dirty.",

    "text": "So first off I wanted to state that I understand that certain restaurants don't want to allow any substitutions from their menu, but there's a difference between saying 'no substitutions' and 'we can't accommodate that\". when i ordered the breakfast sandwich I asked if they could please do egg whites instead of the fried egg, the guy behind the counter just said 'no i can't accommodate that'. This was a Wednesday morning at around 9:30, there was no line of people, the place had about 4 customers that were sitting and was by no means busy. I asked the guy if they used real eggs, he replied yes, so i asked again why they couldn't just do egg whites, because I am allergic to the yolk. The guy just responded again \"we can't accommodate that\" I then asked. ok, well if that's the case, can you please at least make sure the egg is fried over hard so i can just cut out the yolk then? he replied that over hard is how the egg is prepared. I said, ok, then that should work. My boyfriend ordered his food as well, we paid and went outside to sit. When our food finally came out to us I was disappointed to see that they made the egg over medium and cut the sandwich in half spilling the yolk all over the sandwich. I looked at the guy that delivered the sandwich and said 'you guys cut the yolk all over the sandwich, i can't eat this'. He then just set down the plate and said \"is there anything else you guys need?\" and before we could say anything he just walked away. i at least was able to eat the few little over-cooked potatoes that came with the sandwich, other than that it was a waste of money. So once again i'd like to point out, I get that the world doesn't revolve around me and that me having an allergy to egg yolk isn't something that restaurants like this care about and need to attempt to help with, however, when you tell me that you are cooking something OVER HARD after you hear that I have an allergy, and you don't cook it that way and spill yolk all over it, it makes me feel like you actually went out of your way in order to punish me for my allergy. well at least the coffee was good.",

Others with whom I've dined have enjoyed their meals as well - and that BMOC is the BOMB.   Love it when one of my favorite restaurants for dinner (Tuck Shop) turns out to be owned by the same folks as one of my favorite breakfast spots. I didn't realize that the owners were the same until my second visit to Vovo and it was then that I caught on. (Now I just have to try their other place, \"The Astor House.\")  Vovomeena is counter-order, delivered to your table kind of breakfast place. The queue has always been at least seven to ten deep, but it moves quickly and the food pops out pretty quickly. The menu is unique, diverse and the portions are pretty reasonable for the price point and uniqueness of the dish. The service has always been chatty and memorable. I like it!  The main downfall is that the seating can be somewhat cramped; always prefer the patio but it can easily become too cold or warm. Likewise, the parking lot is certifiably \"for maniacs only\" - it is very tight. There is limited street parking on Lynwood  - residential street south of the parking lot.   Speaking of this area and specifically the street just mentioned - part of the historic \"Roosevelt District\" and it's a niceafter-breakfast idea to take a stroll and to walk off that meal!",

Parking is tricky and you will get towed for parking at nearby businesses.",

I got the biscuits and gravy which were AMAZING. The gravy is seriously to die for. I could have their biscuits and gravy everyday! I had left overs and purposely saved it for the following morning just to savor the gravy. Yes. It. Is. Divine.  My cousin got the waffle with sausage and eggs. The waffle was also delicious!! She's also in loooove with their Japenese coffee!  As for the rest of the menu, there wasn't that much more that was screaming out to me. I knew biscuits and gravy was the right option, and it did not disappoint. We'll probably be back..... just for the biscuits and gravy. Lol",

    "text": "I pass Vovoveema all the time; it was one of those brunch places that remained a mystery to me because they specialize in unconventional brunch dishes. For instance, their signature dish is a B.M.O.C. a huge pork chop with a waffle, eggs, and Portuguese donuts on the side! As curious as it sounded, we decided to save the extra pounds and try their Biscuits and Gravy as well as the Pain Perdu instead.  Both were delicious! The gravy tasted home-cooked and had all the components of comfort food. I thought it tasted something of a distant cousin to a chicken pot pie. The Pain Perdu was one of the largest most delicious French toast I've ever had. It was oozing of bananas, and I was surprised I kept eating it bite after bite!  Finally, we also ordered a coffee flight and had a chance to sample three iced coffees sourced locally in Phoenix. They were made using a Japanese cold-brewing method; I'd recommend trying it, because the taste does differ from cold brews, and if you're already at Vovoveema, why not? Come to Vovoveema if you'd like to take your taste buds on a different journey off the traditional brunch path.",

There isn't a waiter but a nice gentleman walks around making sure all is well. Basically, walk in, order your food and have a seat. They bring the food to your table which was nice. This is more of a cafe spot but very urban and comfortable feel to it. Very modern with some chic added if that makes any sense. Any-who. Perfect place for brunch date with some girlfriends or partner. Food was tasty as i ordered the Mexican Benedict because this is Sonoran dessert and why not order Mexican right. Definitely recommend.",

Employees were nice.  Cons: There are no fountain drinks, that means $2.50 for 1 can of coke. It's one of those strange \"order at the counter, we bring it to you\" places. This leaves a ridiculously long line zig-zagging throughout the entire walkway and eating area of an already cramped dining room. Outdoor seating had only wobbly plastic tables and chairs which led to numerous spills of the coffee.  I won't be going again but if it's your first time and you love coffee, go during the week to avoid the insanely long line and wait time.",

Their food is mostly good, but there are a huge problem for a restaurant of this quality:  they use LIQUID EGG PRODUCT for their scrambled eggs and omelets. This is what McDonald's uses for their scrambled eggs. Liquid egg product has no place in a high quality establishment. They sacrifice quality for speed. The egg product is one example. The other is that their donuts are fried ahead of time and served cold. They have a cold, greasy taste. Where, if they were fried to order, they would be delicious. Vovomeena wants to be a high end establishment, but their process doesn't match up with that goal. Sometimes there are small sacrifices in speed that are so much worth any extra wait.",

I really liked how they smoked the pork chop, it was juicy almost like a ham, but not nearly as salty which I prefer. Normally I always get sunny side up/over easy since I love the ooey gooeyness of the egg yolk, but their scramble didn't disappoint. It was light and fluffy and not over cooked at all :). The doughnut was a little too sweet and oily for my liking and by the time I got to it I was already pretty full from the rest of the meal.

I'm hoping that he'll be able to make some very minor modifications on the menu to account for the vegan population of downtown Phoenix.  Otherwise, I do believe that the owner cares about his businesses and the community.  Fingers crossed.   -- ORIGINAL Review:  Since the corner of McDowell and 7th Ave. is what I refer to as the place where chain restaurants go to die, it makes me happy that there's a local breakfast joint attempting to infiltrate the system.  The first time I ate here was a couple of weeks ago, early on a Sunday and it was delicious.  You walk up to the counter to order, get a number and then sit where you like.  It's small, but there's a nice outdoor patio which should be nice for the next couple of weeks.  Their coffee is amazing and they provide dairy alternatives for those of us who do not use cream in our coffee.    The first time I ordered the BMOC:  a waffle with apple/maple syrup, a smoked porkchop and eggs. (and a portuguese donut!)  Wowza.  Breakfast heaven. The second time I attempted to order the 3 Sisters Strata, but they hadn't received some order or something and it wasn't available, so I settled on the savory crepes.  Also delicious.  Their romesco sauce is delish.  HOWEVER - I can only give three stars.  My vegan friends are simply not able to eat here because whomever wrote the menu just doesn't provide easy alternatives and the second time I ate here my friend's pancakes showed up in 5 minutes while my fiance and I continued to wait an additional 30!  The manager was great about it and very professional, but his excuse about how pancakes are made faster than the rest is ridiculous - when there are orders that take longer, you simply make the longest item first and work your way up.    I'll probably be back, but I'm seriously hoping for some vegan alternatives on the menu and better time management.",

Waffles were okay, no better than most places I have been to.",

    "text": "Vovomeena is located on the SE corner of 7th Ave and McDowell in the same center as how you roll sushi.  The place is very small and has a patio with a few tables as well.  The inside is modern and hipsterishly decorated.  You order at the counter and take a number and have a seat.  You can see the two cooks at the counter in the tiny kitchen preparing your food.  What was awkward was the barista is also the server.  So I found myself waiting for my drink while she was running around serving and bussing tables.  This place was packed so there is no reason they can't hire someone else to serve and bus tables.  Unless that person called out this is something that should be addressed.  I ordered the Mexican Benedict.  My dish was a pair of sopes with chorizo and poached eggs on top with hollandaise.  Along with country potatoes on the side.  The sope tasted store bought, the chorizo was okay but a bit greasy.  It also didn't taste homemade.  The eggs were both overcooked.  Poached eggs are by definition runny.  These egg yokes were rock solid.  The potatoes tasted good but were cold and needed lots of hot sauce.  My wife ordered the tortilla espanola with a green salad.  I literally had to laugh because the green salad was just plain arugula tossed with a vinagerette dressing.  The Spanish omelet was basically a slice of a fritatta that consisted of egg and potatos on top of a red salsa.  It was all very plain and simple but not in a way that showcased the ingredients.  The highlight of both our meals was definitely the bacon.  It was nicely smoked and tasted delicious.  If I had to guess it was bought from Schreiners  The meal was about 25 bucks with a tip.  I personally won't recommend this place and wouldn't drive across town to try it again.  I feel confident after the two meals I've tried there is not much else more to offer.  Very hip, very trendy, tad over priced, and poorly executed on several levels.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt and three stars but I would strongly suggest you temper your expectations.",

We also tried the Wilcox plate: bacon, house potatoes, plain biscuits, and absolutely perfect eggs. Everything was prepared beautifully and served hot.   The staff was friendly and despite the fact it does look like a less than ideal location from outside, it's a great place once you're through the doors.   I visited with a friend and I'd recommend this location mostly for parties of 2, 4 at the most. There are only a few larger spaces available.   Side note: The first time we tried to eat here it was around 11 on a Saturday and the lines were crazy, both the line to order and the line that you then wait in for your table. We were there with three kids and it was immediately obvious that it would be a long wait before one of the handful of larger tables was available. We decided to leave because it clearly wasn't a great time for a family visit. (At which point we drove over to Luci's at The Orchard and it was a perfect day to sit outside and enjoy their patio along with our kids.)",

    "text": "Meh.  Wanted to love this place but even with the cutester name Vovomeena is clearly not in the same foodie league as the far superior Matt's Big Breakfast.   Visited on a Sunday with my 15 year old daughter - located in a strip shopping complex downtown off McDowell. You enter from the back parking lot pavement. Cute inside but honestly nothing that special in terms of decor or ambiance. Unique? Not really.   Daughter ordered the \"Pain Perdu\" Banana Bread Pudding French Toast and I ordered the Tortilla Espanola.   The menu selection honestly left both of us in the dust - looks like the owners are trying way too hard to come up with foodie names and odd mixtures of flavors that make it feel quite limited.  The French Toast arrived and my daughter hated it - she described it as a wet, gloppy, overly sugary soggy mess and said it also tasted like there was meat inside the French Toast (yuck).   After a few bites she sent it back (happily accepted by the friendly staff btw) and got a plain waffle instead (she rated it as fair). She said the bacon was OK but nowhere near as good as Matt's BB. Oh well.   My Tortilla Espnola was decent - probably more potato than egg, a little dry - I've had better. I asked for a little olive oil to serve on top to moisten it a bit - server responded and said the kitchen didn't have olive oil, but \"would I like some vegetable oil instead?\"  A supposedly foodie place that doesn't have olive oil - anywhere? Good grief.   Ignore all the raves at this VERY mediocre spot. This is not and will not be the hot new spot downtown - not even close. LUX does a far better breakfast, so does Coronado Cafe or the reigning champ... Matt's Big Breakfast.   Work on the food and food choices here folks - you guys are trying way too hard.   Good food means simple pleasures prepared and served well. Won't be back.",

The line went fast and food came pretty quick too, considering our mouths were watering just from seeing what others seated around us had ordered. I ordered the Wilcox Avenue which came with 2 eggs cooked to order (I got over medium and they were perfect), breakfast potatoes (well seasoned chunks and perfectly cooked with nice crispy bits), choice of toast or biscuit (GET THE BISCUIT!!!! SERIOUSLY!!! ), and choice of breakfast meat (I got bacon and it was thick cut and nicely cooked, not too crispy and not too flimsy). The biscuit was buttery, flakey, just melts in your mouth. Also comes with side of FRESH strawberry jam. I added a side of the homemade gravy to dip my biscuit in, which has nice chunks of shreiners sausage. Well seasoned. Creamy. So good. To say it was delicious is a huge understatement. My husband got the Blackstone scramble which came with sliced pork shoulder (think nicely smoked really good thick ham pieces), 2 eggs scrambled with onion, garlic, tomato and peppers. This was served with a delicious homemade mouth watering tortilla to wrap it all up in, breakfast burrito style if you desire. My 12 year old daughter got the 12 and under kids choice called the Primrose Hill with choice 3 items: pancake or waffle (she got the waffle which tasted so slightly sweet yummy vanilla malted butter-so so good), eggs, and bacon or sausage. She couldn't even finish half of the waffle it was so thick! We opted for waters which was self service by the coffee area which was also interesting. I would definitely return just for the biscuit and gravy. It was all so filling. I didn't get any pictures because we ate it so fast!",

So you order at the counter, take a number and they bring the food out to you - kind of like Panera or Paradise Bakery.  We tried the orchard french toast and biscuits and gravy.  Both were solid solid dishes!  At about $10 each, I think the french toast could have used another slice though.  The lemon bar was also very good, though my friend thought it was a bit too tart.  I enjoyed it though, seems like they included pulp which I liked.  The coffee was also delicious - hot not iced.  Yes, I am a fan, though it lost 1 star for portion size.",

    "text": "Updated review, I went back per manager request for second try, food much much better, had a grand experience. Not a fan of of the order at the counter and still not a fan of the prepackaged orange juice in plastic cups and odd coffee flight in plastic jugs. Nonetheless the food and drink was spot on.  Great place, almost 5 stars, I'll start with cons then pros:  Cons: Order at bar, my personal preference this takes away ambiance. It causes you to rush your order, keeps you from ordering more, awkward if you are a visitor from Out of town. You can see into the kitchen which could be cool but this kitchen is not the prettiest, looks messy. The place is awkwardly run, folks running around all over, coffee bar has plastic jugs of brewed coffee, be cooler if the coffee was in glass dispensers or something classier. Dirty tables, I wouldn't care so much but if you are required to self seat you have to navigate them Coffee bar is messy, ugly glass fridge showing off messy storage Going back to kitchen which is in clear view, messy messy, bizarre, empty boxes, crap all over floor, food supplies etc. OJ is prepared and stored in plastic cups, I personally would Prefer to get my OJ in a glass. Food although good, seemed a bit messy when served, I saw into the kitchen as mentioned above and the chefs were sloppily throwing food onto a plate. I may be the exception but it was nothing like the Yelp pics. I had to carry a large coffee flight, my OJ, a number, my wallet, phone all around searching for a table  Pros: Food tasted good, I had the pork chop on a waffle, it was soaked to death in a syrup, I've been on a low carb diet so it was heaven but had I not I think it should be a tad drier. The chop was basically a ham steak, it was a bit acrid, over cooked on grill and sugars burnt. Coffee flight was good, unique flavor a Easy parking  Overall, a bit satisfied but more so disappointed, been trying to get here for years. I'm a very frequent patron of Tuck Shop, I believe they own or partnered with this place.  I'll return although with lower expectations.",

    "text": "This is closer to a 3.5 review but I can't quite nudge it up to a 4.  First off, the food is really good.  We had a Benedict and Johnny Cakes.  Both were tasty,a s was the coffee.  The menu was diverse and interesting and the food arrived quickly.  We were lucky enough to share a table  with some friendly people .  The place was packed, with people walking back and forth looking for seating.   Now for the stuff that needs improvement:  I am not a fan of the stand-in,-line, serve-yourself format in small spaces.  The coffee stand is awkwardly placed and, combined with the lack of seating, makes for a lot of unnecessary congestion.  I get the need to turn tables quickly but would like to be able to linger over a cup of coffee, especially at these prices.  I wish you well , Vovomeena, and know that you have a lot of fans.  I may try you again on a weekday but you're a little too claustrophobic and hectic for me on the weekends..",

I'm not a huge pork chop fan, but this one was cooked to perfection. The mixtures of the sweet and savory fulfilled all of my breakfast cravings. The sweet waffle, apple-maple syrup, and Portuguese doughnut paired perfectly with my poached eggs and pork chop.   The portion for the price was incredible. I definitely could not finish my meal, and I like to eat.   I also had the Japanese cold brewed coffee which was refreshing on a warm Phoenix morning.  I was surprised how strong the coffee was. Next time I will try the flight of flavors.   I will be back!!",

    "text": "I'm always amazed by the uniqueness of Phoenix and the restaurants that are hidden in little corners, just like Vovomeena. I love the mismatched chairs, the simple order at the counter set up and the various cold pour coffees they offer.      I went for a morning brunch with a group of friends on the past rainy Saturday morning. I was torn between every single thing on the menu because it all looked amazing, but wound up getting the 3 Sisters Omelette. I grabbed an O.J. from the little deli case (tasted fresh squeezed!) and a hot coffee. When I went over to the coffee counter and realized they do in house infused coffees I couldn't resist. I got the ginger infused coffee and my friend got the mint one..I was on cloud nine--and not just from all the caffeine!       We sat outside and got sprinkled on but it was perfect all around. Our food came quickly and my omelette was sensational. With black beans, corn, zucchini, mozzarella, feta and two sausages on the side it was a filling meal, but not over the top. The blend of zucchini and black beans with mozz were delicious, I couldn't get over how amazing one of my friends' Pain Perdu looked though. Whiskey caramel sauce? I mean c'mon. That's my next victim for sure.     The staff was friendly, but busy, and the decor is homey and old school vintage. You'll want to sit and relax for awhile while you people watch and sip your delicious drinks!",
