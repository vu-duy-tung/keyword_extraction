I was told, \" we are booked for the night.\"  We showed up at 9pm and were seated immediately.  There were MANY empty seats.  I am not sure what the deal was with seating us earlier.  The food was INSANE good.  We each got a filet. We got a backed potato and Fleming's potatoes.  I am not sure why we got them, since we were so stuffed and had to get them to go.  We got the chocolate lava cake for dessert.  It was good, not great.  It tasted burned.  We got the calamari for an appetizer. They were slightly soggy.  The wine was great.  The service was great.  Overall, VERY GOOD.  I will definitely go back!",

We had reservations and were seated immediately.   I had the Flemings martini, and a glass of red wine, along with a daily special featuring steak and tempura shrimp, along with a wedge salad and my date had a scallops dish, along with red wine.   The wedge salad is amongst the best you'll ever find.  They will even chop it up for you if you request.  Savory and delicious.  The steak and tempura shrimp had better flavor on the steak side of things, although friend anything is not my favorite lately.  The shrimp did come with a delicious dipping sauce.   The wine list is amazing and something Flemings is famous for.  We even requested a dessert, which normally takes some time to prepare, and I was concerned, as we were there right at closing time.  But they were gracious and prepared everything to our liking.    The dining room is always elegant, although there was a very loud mouth gentleman talking at top volume about drugs and medical marijuana dispensaries that did not want to seem to quiet down.  At all.  The dining room was empty when we left, as we were the last ones there.  It is strange that this town closes so early on a Thursday, but truly it was a ghost town after 10pm.  Even the waitress was walking to her car as we left.     Overall a wonderful elegant dining experience, and I'd recommend any Flemings locations.",

It continues with the wedge salad, which is still above average, but not nearly as good as I'm used to (i.e., the bacon should be chopped and the blue cheese dressing should have more chunks of blue cheese).    The Flemings Potatoes were excellent.  My rib eye was underwhelming.  It didn't have the usual crust I've come to expect.  Service was good.",

    "text": "This restaurant has a lot going for it. We celebrated our anniversary here before seeing Phantom of the Opera, and they definitely kept the night classy. They fell short of five stars, but in ways that made 4 stars an easy decision.  It started with a reservation. Perhaps we just aren't regulars, but people would come in after us and be seated before us for the exact same reservation, exact same time. This is the moment I knew we'd have time issues.   However, we were wished happy anniversary by everyone as we sat, and they signed a card and gave a small box of chocolates. The service tried to be great, and nearly succeeded. The place was loud, but in a festive kind of way. Not quite romantic, but fun nonetheless.  The servers took great care of us, making solid recommendations and being generally humorous and engaging. Unfortunately, they also brought out the calamari appetizer AFTER the steak, and only after being reminded. Yet I can't completely throw them under the bus, because they took the calamari off the check.  And that calamari. Amazing. And that New York Strip. Perfection. And that chicken. Total win. Even the gnocchi was great. The salad sucked, but it was a basic Caesar. Just wish they'd used something other than hearts in there. But the rest was amazing.   Again, overall amazing food, and a solid recovery that kept this a four star experience even with the blunders. I still left wanting to come back. And come back we will.",

We have been going to Fleming's for years and will continue to do so.  Yes, it is expensive for a typical night out so it's not a go-to that often for us but we still really enjoy the little splurge every now and again.  Fleming's is a great date night or special occasion place with friends.  I typically get the petite filet with the 3oz add-on shelled lobster tail.  The filet is always cooked to perfection and extremely tasty.  The lobster looks small when it is served but is always the right amount for me.  We almost always get a few sides and last night was no different.  We had our standard creamed spinach (my fav), Fleming's potatoes and creamed corn (I wasn't a huge fan of the creamed corn as it was a little spicy and that's not my thing).  The service is always excellent.  Almost forgot to mention that I love the Farmer's Daughter Martini...Delicious!  But beware, they go down quickly!  It's always a nice night out at Fleming's.  Just writing this review is making me hungry!!",

Neither of us were able to finish our meals because we wanted to leave space for desert. We shared the crime brulee. It was amazing. We topped it with the Chantilly cream, which you can just eat alone with a spoon. It was the perfect cap to the night.

    "text": "Not what you would expect for a $150+ meal for two. For an \"upscale\" steakhouse the food and service were nothing great. First, we never got the bread our server said would be right out when we arrived. We proceeded to ask for it two additional times before it was finally brought to us when we received our entree. The halibut was ok, but over cooked and the sauce on top was over bearing. The calamari was decent, but I have definitely had better. I also wish they put whatever sauce they had on it on the side so they breaded part stayed crispy. The only saving grace of the meal were the Fleming's potatoes. They were delicious. I doubt I would ever find myself back here, but if I did I would get the potatoes. Lastly, its not necessary to ask every time you refill water/ice tea, just fill it up and if I am not thirsty anymore I won't drink it and thus you won't refill it.   If you are looking for a delicious meal with great service this is not the place for you. My personal favorite in the valley is Mastro's City Hall - you will not leave disappointed.",

    "text": "Tonight was my Birthday (7/17/2017) and so we went to Flemings to celebrate. Appetizer of Shrimp cocktail came out and it looked and tasted very good. Order was taken for dinner and my wife ordered a side salad as her meal because she wasn't super hungry and decided to add salmon to it to flare it up. I ordered the king crab leg entree but wanted soup to come out first, which it did a short while later along with my wife's salad that was supposed to be an entree. Now the salad, although premature, didn't come out as requested with Salmon on it (as my wife may have considered eating it since it was at the table already) so it was sent back. Soup was very good and flavorful and the servers and assistant were on point as far as pre-bussing and getting refills. Ok, now entrees hit the table. First impression was Blah.... presentation was severely lacking. My wife's salad is really just lettuce with a small filet of salmon on top. Not really much body to the salad and she said the salmon was very bland as she couldn't have butter... but you would have thought the chef could have gotten creative with it despite the allergy to butter/oil. Now my Crab legs, when it was placed in front of me it was 3 small pieces about 6in in length that were halved. That's it, very boring and portion size for amount paid was horrible. I inquired with food runner about the portion size confirming this was my entree and he said yes. My wife and I looked at each other in amazement. Approximately 5 min later or so into the meal one of our two servers came by and said \"your other half of your meal will be out shortly\". Well that's a relief, but when it came out it tasted like salt water from the ocean and was not edible. 50% of the cost was comp'd. The server also spilled Ice Tea on/in my wife's purse. When we get the bill, my wife was charged $44 for the salmon and I think $12 for the lettuce. A $56 salmon salad that was horrible at best. The salad was more expensive than my crab legs. So Sad, time to find a new place.",

We had a couple of non-food related problems on our visit a couple of weeks ago.   As we waited for our table, my daughter purchased the three of us drinks at the bar to make the wait a little more enjoyable. After being seated at our table, we were hit up by the manager for a new bar-bill total. Their mistake. This was a bit uncomfortable and looked to the surrounding tables as if we tried to pull a fast one. Not a comfortable situation. It seemed to me as if they might have taken the small hit instead of coming to our table asking for a couple of dollars.    The other issue involved virtually non-existent ADA restroom access for a person in a wheelchair. This is huge for injured persons in wheelchairs and if you happen to be a para or quadrapaligic, forget about it. First, you will not be able to get into the bathroom stall unless you are quite creative and then, when leaving, you will find the main door opens inward and even if you are able to get hold of the handle in the small space provided, you won't be able to open it and move your chair at the same time. Imagine having to ask someone walking by to open the door to the bathroom door so you can get back to your table  With all the ADA tools available, an upscale establishment like this should pony up for a push button door control!",

Great place to bring a date if you don't mind to spend so much money, but actually it's worth it...  I had a beer, a great IPA, rotator from widmer brothers. Very nice.  Then we ordered some appetizers, some seafood, shrimps and crab and lobster plate. That was beautiful, fresh and the sauces with it were so good. I was already full after this but we had then one of their suggestion. A huge piece of beef for 2 with a very long bone. I can't remember its name. Sides : the corn and mashed potatoes with garlic. Insane. Great. We also had some onions, so tasty! Amazing! I was so full after this but I couldn't resist to try one of their desserts. I had the creme brulee, and god it was perfect! I tried several times before but that one is the best I had in USA. Served with fresh berries.  And then, the coffee. You guys don't know what is a real espresso, I'm sorry to tell you this. But actually Flemings espresso is great! Oh and, I forgot the most important... The bread. They give you a big piece with sauces, blue cheese and a whipped butter. Oh my god this is the best bread I had in the area. Even if it's not as good as French baguette, that was pretty good.  I will go back to that place for sure, expensive one but worth it so bad!",

Gigi gets 5 stars, she was great. I made reservations months in advance because I was coming to town to celebrate my moms 75th birthday...not realizing it was Restaurant Week. We had a party of 6. The waiter was VERY busy when we arrived at 6:30pm on time for our reservation. He brought us menus and seemed bugged from the beginning. He was not happy when my mom asked for the Pre Fixe menu. She eats smaller portions so why not? 2 ordered off the Pre Fixe menu and 3 of us ordered off the regular menu. (one of our party left because he became ill from travel and dehydration) I ordered the tuna steak which was cut in half, not a steak but a 1/2\" LITTLE piece that had been cut horizontally into two small pieces and was $47.00 The others ordered steak and a lamb chop which looked plentiful. We had 3 sides as well as salads and dessert. The food honestly was just okay. Not worth the $375.00 plus 20% tip which I paid but it was not earned. I am really disappointed in Flemings, it was always my go-to steakhouse even though I dont eat anything but fish...thanks for the memories.",

I almost cried that's how good it tasted. they give you a little box of chocolate truffles that I have yet to try and $25 off your next visit, worth every Penny of. our $250 Bill. a must-try for your special occasion!",

    "text": "This is a strange review to write, because I'm a fan of Fleming's. I expect to write a 5 star review every time... but today, this is a 3 Star review that was bumped to 4 for good reason. I came in with a party of 8 coworkers, celebrating the end of the year. Our party included a mixture of people, some who eat at higher end restaurants on occasion, and some who were experiencing $50 steaks for the first time. Those of us with a little more experience, hyped up Fleming's and set expectations high. After all, it doesn't get a whole heck of a lot better. Right? We took advantage and ordered a lot of food. For starters we had the crab cakes, the calamari and the cold seafood tower. The calamari was fantastic! Great flavor, and this coming from someone who normally doesn't like calamari. Crab cake was good, though not amazing, and everything in the seafood tower was solid.  We had a couple of bottles of  a great Cab, Stag's Leap Artemis- which was wonderful ($135 a bottle). A few salads were ordered, all looked good and plates were cleaned. We shared a number of sides; Fleming's potatoes, mashed potatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, Brussel sprouts, and the Mac-n-cheese. All the sides were good, no complaints at all. Fleming's potatoes and the Brussels sprouts (believe it or not) seemed to get the best reviews. The disappointment tonight, shockingly, was the steaks. 7 of 8 ordered steaks. 5 of the 7 were cooked at the wrong temperature, 4 under cooked and one over cooked.  I'm not a complainer and I'm pretty good at eating a steak anywhere around medium, but my steak was medium-rare and closer to rare than medium-rare. As I cut around the edges of my $60 steak, I noticed others doing the same. After taking a pole, I learned that nearly everyone had an issue with their temperature. Problem was, by the time a waiter came by to see how everything was, the meal was half over. He asked how everything was, and I showed him my steak. I asked, \"what temperature is this?\", he said \"mid-rare\", that's right! But I ordered medium, and so did he, and so did she, and him over there...all the medium temps were cooked mid/rare to rare and one was cooked closer to med/well. Not one was cooked perfectly. Very surprised. I've never had temperatures so far off, for so many, in a single meal at any restaurant.  The issue of course is sending your steak back when the meal is half over. By the time you get it returned, everyone is finished and you're eating alone! No thanks, I'm not going to send it back- but I'm not happy. I expect wrong temperatures from Outback or Texas Roadhouse, but not Fleming's. And certainly not 5 of 7 steaks. If that was the end, I'd call this a 3 Star review. However....  The manager came by and said he heard there was a problem with some of the temperatures, I showed him what was left of my steak, explained that 5 of the 7 were wrong and why it was too late in the meal to send them back. He apologized, and without batting and eye, said they expect better and so should we...and took all 5 steaks off our bill. That's about $300, just like that.   I wasn't asking for free food and truth be told, my undercooked steak was still really tasty, just not the way I ordered it. The manager could have stopped at offering to cook our steaks more, or bringing a new one, but understood that it was too late. He went above and beyond my expectations by removing them from our bill. And that's why I had to add a star.   Will I be back? Yes I will. I've had a number of 5 star experiences at Fleming's...and now that I know there's basically a money back guarantee, I've got nothing to lose! A+ on the customer service.",

Something called Fleming's potatoes which is about a  three-by-five brick of augratin potatoes with cheese on top, $13.

I had a $50 ribeye that was so disappointing, I  honestly believe I could have gotten a better steak at Denny's with breakfast. The one cocktail I had was $11 and maybe had a half a shot of bourbon.

    "text": "This is sort of a tough review.  Flemings puts themselves out as high-end, and they charge high-end prices.  So one expects more from them than, for example, a Black Angus.  Normally I wouldn't go to a high-end steak house.  Frankly between my wife and I, we can do as well or better at home.  She does a couple of different seasonings depending on her mood, and I am pretty good at grilling them.  Anyway...we were invited to a seminar and the deal was they would feed us here.  Flemings does have some menu options you won't see at Black Angus, which is fine.  On this occasion I had the filet medallions (I think that's what they called them) with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Really nothing that fancy, but done properly this would be really good.  First point...I ordered medium well.  We agreed (the waiter and I) that this meant there would be a little pink, but not much.  Just a bit.  So when it come out it's medium rare.  VERY pink.  Not even medium.  Gotta mark them down for that.  Lots of places do that, and it's annoying.  I've given up asking anyone to cook it more because it always comes back either dry or burned.  Not Flemings specifically, but any steak place.  It's like they're annoyed...\"you want it done more, I'll show you 'done more', you cretin!!\".  Instead I just live with it.  Flavor-wise the filet was good.  Basic seasoning, nothing fancy.  But \"nothing fancy\" works in this case.  Nice flavor.  The potatoes were a bit cheesy, not much garlic.  They were fine.    Nothing special.  I think a bit more garlic was in order as I couldn't really detect any. The green beans I thought were a little under-cooked but I know a lot of people like that crisp snap.  The seasoning of the beans was good.  More than just a little salt, they really jazzed them up.  I liked them.  So the verdict?  Well, given how they bill themselves and what you pay I simply expect more.  I expect exciting flavors (even with potatoes), and I expect them to know what \"medium-well\" means and how to achieve it.  The meal was fine.  Even good.  But was it truly \"high-end\"?  I don't think so.  I've had high-end a few times, and this wasn't it.  So they're \"OK\", but I can't go so far as to say I'm a fan.  Three stars.",

We started with the chilled seafood tower which while pricey, was excellent.  This was followed by salads and I have to say that I preferred the\"old\" Wedge versus the New Wedge. The previous Wedge was the best that I have had anywhere and was just the right combination of flavors and crispy iceberg lettuce.  Steaks (Filets and Prime Ribeyes)  were tender, moist, and cooked to perfection.  Personally, I just prefer the high-temperature broiling method that Flemings uses to cook their steaks versus an open-flame/grilling approach. One diner had Seabass which fresh and tender. Sides (grilled asparagus, Fleming's potatoes, and creamed spinach) are always fresh and flavorful and among the best I've had anywhere.  The Raymond Napa Valley Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon was a nice value accompaniment with the steaks.  Creme Brulee was excellent and the Chantilly cream is just sinful.  A great place for special occasion.",

Loved it! *Molten chocolate cake- I don't normally like this type of dessert, but the portion was so big, I shared my husband's. It was rich, but not obnoxiously sweet. Served with premium vanilla ice cream, tulle cookies, pistachios, and the most Delicious homemade whipped cream I've ever had. The only downsides: * Fleming's potatoes were a bit oily and didn't taste the jalapeno. Next time I'll try one of the mashed choices. * One of my pet peeves is when a menu lists a ton of ingredients for an item, and it seems to be fully inclusive but it's not. This is the case with the house salad. The menu listed cranberries, tomatoes, croutons, etc. but not onions. I didn't think to ask bc the description seemed very comprehensive. Well, there were red onions all over the salad I had to pick off and some type of shallots or other similar onion relative chopped into small pieces that could not be separated. I can't eat onions, so I tasted the salad but couldn't eat it. The lemon vinaigrette dressing was excellent, though. $ - We got two entrees, 2 salads, two side orders, one dessert, and 2 nonalcoholic beverages for $104. Not bad at all for the quality of food. We will definitely be back.",

From the very beginning, she came across as very snooty and condescending. It made the whole table feel uncomfortable to the point of almost requesting another server. During the entire meal, she made little snide remarks and felt the need to correct us about everything from the type of coffee they serve, whether the cappuccino was sweetened, what order we needed to order in and even how bad the blood Mary's were there. She didn't check on the food after served and seemed bothered by any questions about the menu. Overall, it was a very bad experience not necessarily because of the food but because of Aubrey.  Although we looked young, everyone at that table makes 6 figures a year with platinum Amex cards as you saw. Don't do that...be mean, judgmental and arrogant. You were officially the lowest tip I have left in the last 20 years. Flemings you deserve and have better servers. Please know that Aubrey is not representing the brand or the chandler restaurant well at all.",

OK enough said about that, the service here is phenomenal excellent wait staff excellent food my wife went here for her birthday and had a great time we stuck to small plates not because we were worried about cost but we like to eat smaller portions and I am NOT one to really go for a $60 steak I do believe that's a bit on the high side. We started off with a spinach salad that was outstanding and I had the soup of the day which was a leek soup which was really one of the best I've ever had for the main course we had a short rib and a shrimp and scallop dish both wonderfully prepared actuall  did have a good bottle of wine and topped off with the creme brulee I understand that there molten lava cake is something to be seen but we're creme brulee fans and it was again perfectly prepared and enough for two the same is True of their side dishes   again the service was outstanding the waiter was attentive without being overly bearing this is a perfect place for an anniversary or birthday it's certainly not going to be your Thursday night steak joint but highly recomend for special treat.",

Our family enjoys a good cut that's perfectly done to each person's speculations. Also the service was perfect. Our server was thoughtful and attentive, without overly interrupting when we didn't need anything. However, for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu, we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive, more fancy, not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return. If I'm paying this much, I'd like to feel a little more pampered.",

We had a reservation so we walked in and was greeted with an Anniversary card that was signed by the staff! Unbelievable! We get seated and order our drinks and meal. The service was spectacular! The food is amazing. Everything was perfect to make our night so special. The manager came to our table to greet us and wished us a Happy Anniversary. My boyfriend asked a question about his meal and noticed they left off the bacon on his steak. No big deal but the manager took care of it immediately. After we finished our meal, we got our check and our waiter gave us a $50 gift card and some gourmet chocolate! We could not believe it. Our experience was unforgettable and we plan to go back very soon! Service goes a long way and they nailed it!",

One of the best entrees we've ever had.  Now it's hard to go to a steak house and order anything but steak but this particular dish is worth the sacrifice.  A full half of chicken beautifully grilled and surrounded by a dozen or more mouth-watering spinach gnocchi.  Everything was wonderful, from the bread & spreads to the creme brulee, but the star of the night was the free range chicken.",

    "text": "My wife and I met 2 friends at the bar for some happy hour and dinner action last night.  It was about 6:30 and I think we snagged just about the last open table.    I was pretty impressed with their happy hour selections and prices.  The ladies had glasses of wine and the guys had a Kettle martini with blue cheese olives (my absolute fav!).  The martini was excellent especially because it was 6 bucks.  The wine pour was a bit skimpy though.  The 4 of us shared the crab cake appetizer and it was excellent and will definitely order it again.  For an entree I ordered the sliced fliet mignon burger sans bun.  It is exactly as it sounds; basically a sliced filet mignon.  It was pretty thick so I have no idea how people actually eat the thing on a bun.  Anyway it was excellent as well as good sized.  I would order it again but I keep reading about how the Fleming's prime burger is very good not to mention a 3rd of the cost of the sliced filet burger.  I will probably try that next time.  My wife ordered the portebello mushroom burger and it was awesome.  It was topped with sauteed spinach and goat cheese.  OMG sooo good!  I should order that next time to put on top of a real burger.  It  was actually very good and I could see myself ordering that if I was not in the mood for red meat.  For dessert we all shared the lava cake.  WOW! Sooo good!  You have to order it 20 minutes in advance so you know it is fresh.  It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a bowl of fresh homemade whip cream.  The whole thing was just awesome but that whip cream put it over the edge.  The entire staff that waited on us during the evening were very fast and friendly.  All-in-all it was an excellent evening with great food and service.  I will definitely be back!",

The only (2) two complaints that I have: the prime burger is a whooping 1105 calories (and I'm not even sure if this includes the special sauce and the two onion rings that are served on the side). It's my fault I should've asked the server since the caloric intake is not listed on the menu.  Second issue, how many times do you have to ask a server for straws until you get frustrated. Also, wouldn't you think that an empty glass of water means \" please fill up my glass\". Come on servers this is a high end establishment. Get it together!!!!! Very frustrating!",

They were beyond annoyed by this time and we were kept waiting in the lobby for them to fix this code red catastrophe (insert eye roll).Ok so on to the actual meal. Our waitress was here and there and forgot more often than forgivable. Also when we were ordering our meal she asked us if we wanted soup or salad with our entree, in my opinion implying that it was included with the order, but guess what? Not the case. This establishment tries to act like it is some high end steak house, but they only succeed in ACTING like it. My meal was cold and the steaks were a joke. The only good review that I would give would be for their clam chowder. As we were exiting the restaurant the hostesses gave us no more than a look in our direction leaving me feeling like a second class citizen... who spent more than $500 on a below average meal.",

We are not a family that minds spending a little for excellent food but this meal did not meet the standard for the amount our meal was for three people.  The portions of the appetizers we shared were tiny. I think we had three pieces of ravioli in the ravioli dish which was not much. My steak left a pile of inedible gristle that filled a quarter of my plate and I don't even usually mind a little fat which adds flavour.  It was clearly not edible but the waiter asked me 'aren't you going g to eat that?' 'Uh..that's a no.' For the price I would not go there again. Too expensive for mid level quality.

Here's their 3 course meal:  1)Fleming's Salad: Candied walnuts, dried cranberries, tomatoes and croutons. Rating: 3/5. The salad was decent, but not memorable. I thought the salad was very simple, nothing to rave over. When I think of a good salad, I think of Wildflower's combination salad. This one was just average.   2) Lite Filet Mignon served with Fleming's Potatoes. Rating: 3.5/5. Maybe it's because I had Sushi Roku's Filet Mignon 4 days prior (which was superb and steak isn't even their speciality). The Filet Mignon was good, I just expected it to be a lot more juicy and tender since it is a steak house afterall.   3) Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse. Rating: 1/5. The first bite was OK, I had two or three more bites expecting it to be much better but it didn't get better. Our waitress even said it was her favorite... but it was a total disappointment.   Overall, they've got great service and its a classy restaurant. However, I do not think I'll be coming back. All I could think about was this was the most expensive meal I've had in a year and for ~$50 it's a plane ticket from PHX to SAN.",

They provided a gift card and some truffles for my girlfriend which was a nice touch. The reason for the poor review is are table was surrounded by gnats that were flying around us during our entire meal. One even landed in our wine glass and we had to brush them away which made for an unromantic dinner. We told the waitress and they called see us brushing the gnats away but made no attempt to move us. Not sure if it's a lack of cleaning in that area but avoid the back booths.",

    "text": "Consistently incredible service and flawless steaks award Fleming's Steakhouse five big ones. I've been to steakhouses all over the country and this place holds it's own with the best of them while not being overbearingly expensive. It's not cheap by any means, and it's got a dash more of the old school cool flare than the modern feel to it, but I don't consider that a particular fault. Few places at this point in time get me as fired up as knowing I'm going to Fleming's for a bone-in rib-eye... that thing is a masterpiece.",

Wedge salad was a pleasure - big slices of blue cheese on fresh bacon.  Wonderful.  All entrees were prepared perfectly - dry aged ribeye, filet, salmon - excellent.  Mac and cheese and au gratin potatoes were just as decadent as we'd expect.  The onions were a bit grainy but not bad.  For desert we got a molten lava cake - oozy as expected plus a perfectly crisp vanilla cookie and ice cream.  Wow.  A grass hopper for a night cap and I'm already planning my next trip.

    "text": "It was my Birthday and my wife, her mom, a dear friend and I headed to Fleming's Steakhouse in Chandler, AZ. We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately.   The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish? In short, we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal.  Next time, we'll go to a well tried place for steaks and more. Durant's, downtown Phoenix and worth the drive.",

    "text": "What an amazing night we had.  We were looking for restaurants tonight in and near Tempe (we're visiting from Los Angeles), we found Flemings!  And then I remembered I  had a gift card for $100 that a friend had given me.  The portions looked so huge that we decided to split an entree, a potato and a salad. We even split a glass of wine!  It was a wonderful decision.  As we looked around, we saw all male/female couples and we pondered and wondered if male/female couples were treated any differently than us. So Janet casually asked our waitress  if she were homophobic. She said, \"No, not at all!\"  We told her we were celebrating our anniversary - 2 years of legal marriage and almost 24 years of being together.  She thought that was great!  How wonderful, we thought.  We even showed her a picture of our 3 month old granddaughter.  So we ate our delicious meal which was excellent, everything cooked to perfection- we were too full for dessert.  The check comes and it's almost exactly $100... $102 to be exact. Great!  I took out the gift card and was about to pay when the manager comes over and extends his hand and says \"I hear it's your anniversary!\"  \"Yes,\" we say.  He tells us that they are very supportive of us and he is so happy to tell us that the whole meal was comped!  We were more than thrilled!  Not only for the comped meal but for the recognition that we are as legit as any other couple.  They even brought us some Godiva chocolates to take with us.  Please patronize Flemings whatever your relationship status! We come back here about once a year and will certainly come back again - for our next anniversary!  All because we decided to speak up and be seen as who we are - a couple, in love, celebrating with good food and a great atmosphere. And instead of prejudice, we were met with compassion, equality and legitimacy. Made us feel very special. Megan was our server who was great even before she knew about us. And Anthony was the manager who was so genuinely kind and generous. We were really astonished!  The whole staff was great.  Oh and when one of the male/female couples left (one of the ones we noticed were very sweet and close to each other) they came over to us and said \"We overheard it was your anniversary and we wanted to tell you our congratulations!\"   Amazing!!  How far we've come. Thank goodness.",

And we had to complain about the service the last time we went in and thought we would give it a shot again maybe it was just a new guy or something. The food was also so bad the last time we had to return the meals after waiting for so long to get it. This time around there were 4 of us, he took our drink order one person at a time (literally turned around and walked off after one person ordered and did not return for a long time) After we all finally got drinks I was able to get him to take an appetizer order. It was brought out after a while. When it was delivered he came by and took out menus. Did not take our order. Just grabbed the menus. After he came back to collect the empty seafood tower I asked him if he would like to take our dinner order. \"Oh are you ready to order?\" Really?? Who orders their entre after finishing the app? After our mediocre steaks were delivered 2 HOURS AFTER WE GOT THERE is when we decided we would never return. We sat at the table for 30 min after we were done eating and our table had been cleared waiting for our $500 bill. We had to flag down another waiter to get it delivered who told us all their servers including Ray has worked there for about 15 years and was chuckling about the poor service we had received 2 times in a row from him. I have been a waitress and a bartender for many years, so I can laugh off a crappy server here and there. But when you are dropping $500 on a dinner that isn't even amazing it is nothing to laugh about. The service is ridiculous and the prices they charge for their only decent food is outrageous. WILL NEVER RETURN!",

If the ribeye was in fact a \"prime\" ribeye, they did one heck of a job cooking all of the flavor out of it.  To mask the horrible grill work, they covered the steak with more salt that was necessary for the entire cow.  I've been lucky enough to dine an a wide array of steak houses that claim to serve \"prime\" steak, and this is the bottom of the list.  I would not recommend this restaurant for a large group as the atmosphere is quite loud.  We had six people at our table and a conversation that included everyone was not possible.  To end on a positive note, the servers and wait staff were terrific.  They are easily on-par with other prime steakhouses around the country.  Regarding the item on the menu that I enjoyed the most was the sweet chili calamari.",

    "text": "New Year's Eve reservations were made well in advance, but when we got there on time, the lobby was packed, people were lined up waiting, and the bar had no seating. We were told when we checked in that previous customers decided to linger and so the wait time would be about 20 mins to half an hour and that we could order a drink in the bar lounge while we waited.  Well there was absolutely no room in the bar  or anywhere else to wait, so we waited for about 20 mins lined up against a wall in the pathway of waitstaff.  People just kept  coming and waiting and waiting and waiting. If Flemings is going to take reservations, they need to honor that and not greedily overbook so that there are so many people waiting in the lobby that there is no breathing room.  I'm sure that they have done New Years Eve before and should be able to guess pretty accurately how many reservations to take. Otherwise, they should be honest and say, sorry we don't take reservations and it is on a first come serve basis so that people can plan for that. Management is really not concerned with how customers view this restaurant. Management is really not concerned with how customers view this restaurant since the manager didn't acknowledge the problem when we spoke to him  or apologize or do anything else. We used to think Fleming was a pretty good restaurant,  but we don't plan to go there again or recommend others to go there or take our out of town guests there.  It's the principle of the thing. People will hear about our experience there as we are always asked about where to eat. A word of advice to the management.  Customer service IS very important to the survival of any business.",

We each ordered a filet mignon and a bunch of sides to share. One of the steaks was supposed to be well-done and came out pretty pink. He wasn't going to say anything but the server came back and noticed it was pink. She apologized and took it back. The steak was brought back and was still a little undercooked. They comped the steak off the tab. The managers, Bruce and Mark, both came over separately apologizing and did whatever they could to make it right and they sure did. They gave us free desserts and took off the filet off our tab. Brittany was so personable. Mark and Bruce really were nice and accommodating. We didn't expect anything out of and they went the extra mile to make us feel special. I am in awe with these amazing people who provided us with a wonderful and special dinner.

Thank you Bruce, Mark, and Brittany for giving us an amazing evening at your restaurant. We appreciate it so much!!",

We had a wonderful server, and were greeted by the manager who congratulated us. The ambiance is very nice for special occasions and anniversaries, however if you wanted to catch the football game or baseball game, you could eat at the bar area. The noise from the bar area does not carry into the fine dining area.   We both ordered a Caesar salad, the filet mignon and lobster tail, and for dessert we shared the chocolate lava cake AND the cheesecake. Their prices are fair - it's a fine dining establishment. The filet mignon was cooked exactly how I wanted it, and the lobster was delicious. Needless to say, I will be looking forward to celebrating at this Fleming's again.",

Waiter and staff were very nice..professional. Takes our Drink order..spends the next half hour with the group of 20. Finally I get his attention and beg for another beer. I actually have to ask about getting an appetizer...Dang..  So far the anniversary is going south.... Next we decide to split a $65 Ribeye medium rare..... Comes out raw. Dang.... Could have went to Safeway for this steak. Server tells me be careful with the plate...Hot...and all that.  It was about as hot as a chilled salad plate at Applebees. Dang.. So much for sizzling butter.  Ah..man...Well the coffee was delicious....I will say that. Again, the waiter and staff were top notch. The food was no better than Sizzler..and that is after dropping $200.  Cant risk going back with that kind of damage....",

    "text": "I don't normally like to write negative reviews, and I certainly did not expect to write one about this steak chain based on its reputation, but our first experience here will be our last.  We chose to eat at Fleming's because we wanted a nice dinner before a show we were seeing at the AMC Cinema across the highway.  Our reservation was early, 5PM, just at opening.  Perhaps this was the mistake we made, or perhaps our experience was typical.  Entering the restaurant I was instantly blinded by how dark it was.  It was as if they had forgotten to turn on the lights.  Being led to our small, cramped, too narrow booth, I bumped into other booth edges and tripped over chairs because I could not see them.  After squeezing into the seat I was handed the wine list which I also could not read.  It took a good 10 minutes for my eyes to adjust to the cave-like lighting.  Not impressed.  Also not impressive was the waiter, who maybe was having a bad day or maybe he had just arrived and was not yet in \"waiter mode\" or maybe he was just a jerk, but he was not attentive nor seemingly interested in serving us.  He did not have a suggestion for wine even after I informed him I was ordering a bottle, which is not in character for a \"Wine\" restaurant.  If he worked for me he'd have been out on his ear.  The wine list was good, although short on our favorite varietals.  We found the one red Zinfandel on the list to try.  And then we waited.  A bus boy brought us water, but no bread.  Other tables seemed to have bread.  We waited some more.  And some more.  Does it take 30 minutes to get a bottle of wine?  I started checking my watch, knowing we only had 2 hours until the show.  Eventually the waiter returned with the wine.  I tried to joke with him that maybe the bottle was just a hard one to find and he grunted something unintelligible, showed me the label for 5 seconds and popped the cork, then asked if we were ready to order.  We ordered salads and steaks and he said \"thanks\" and left.  OK, I will pour my own glass.  The salads were the highlight of the meal.  My wife had a wedge and I had their special salad, and we both enjoyed them.  This was the only part of the meal we enjoyed.  When the steaks arrived we had to ask for bread to accompany the meat, which eventually arrived.  The steaks looked to be done to our Med-Rare order but both my wife's filet and my aged NY Strip were raw at one end.  It was almost as if they had been half-off the grill.  We could not eat them, and had no time to send them back.  We ate what we could and had the rest boxed to nuke at home.  My wife ordered a side of mushrooms and I the asparagus, and while the asparagus was done it was flavorless and my wife's mushrooms so full of garlic that was all they tasted of.  We finished our wine, paid the nearly $300 check and left.  We will not be back.  Also, we cannot assert that there were hormones in the beef, but my wife is sensitive to this and after eating here she was sick for some time.  Ugh.  We cannot assert that the beef was tainted... however...",

    "text": "Why 3 stars?? When I eat at somewhere like Fleming's and pay the prices that they ask, my expectations are higher than usual: I expect to be impressed. I have been to Fleming's restaurants several times over the years, although I think the last few visits have been to the Scottsdale location.   My wife and I came for a prime rib special. The set menu included the meat, two sides, and two desserts. We were able to get a reservation for 7pm, but ended up getting free earlier, so we stopped by to see if there were any walk-in tables available. It is worth noting that walk-ins are probably difficult to come by here: the dining room was booked solid until our reservation time. Curiously, though, the dining room was basically EMPTY. We were offered a seat on the patio, which was fine. We were told that we could sit in the bar. Sadly, the tiny bar was already full of people who knew how this works.  Service: I have to give props to the waitstaff. The people handling our table were great. Our water glasses were never less than half full, despite being on the patio and that requiring a special trip during the first part of our visit. We seemed to have come at a transition time for some of the staff, so we didn't start with him, but Casey was ultimately our waiter and he was great.  Meat: While not my favorite cut of meat, I have roasted several rib roasts and do enjoy it. I am accustomed to a more round than blade-shaped cut of prime rib, but you can carve a slice from different places on the roast, and they will have different shapes. We ordered the steaks medium, and they came out a bit more brown (well) than mauve (medium). I know, I know: medium rare is the way to eat prime rib and how we usually cook it at home. Out, though, I've had too many experiences where that comes out still bleeding, so I asked for something a little more \"done\" this time. It was not worth complaining about, since it was pretty close and I don't like wasting food. I chalked it up to learning how Fleming's interprets doneness for prime rib. The meat came with three sauces for dipping the meat into: a creamy horseradish, an au jus, and a third one that had a bit of vinegar and spice to it. That was nice.  Sides: We had the Fleming's potatoes and the grilled asparagus. The asparagus was cooked well, but some of the stalks still had the hard part on the ends -- you know, the part that you usually snap off before cooking? It is still asparagus, but I would expect a little more care from a high-end place like Fleming's. The potatoes that impressed us so much last time were a little flat this time. They were creamy and good, but not amazing.  Dessert: My wife had the cheesecake and I had the creme brulee. The second was by far the star of the show. Unless there is a reason you can't have it, get that one. Seriously. I guess the molten chocolate cake is popular as well, but I'll take custard over cake just about any day. My wife said the cheesecake was nothing special and that I had definitely made the better choice.   I generally like Fleming's enough to give it 4 stars, and, overall, the meal was fine, but it wasn't spectacular as I feel it should have been at a place like this. According to the other reviews, I apparently need to order the filet. For me on this visit, though, the Yelp 3-stars = \"A-OK\"",

It was very fancy, from the moment I sashayed my pretty little self in, to the time I was escorted to my white linened table, with their newfangled iPad wine and dessert list.  The parmesan crusty loaf was accompanied by both a feta and sundried tomato spreads, but I like Firebird's bolero loaf better.  The water tasted chlorinated though.  I could understand maybe bleach, ya know, for whiter teeth  Once again, I chose the wrong venue to sport my lederhosen and ICP mesh half shirt.  This place was popping, at 9:30pm.  It's nice to see the older generation still having date nights... with what appears to be their granddaughters.  :/  My waitress, Megan was an old soul and classy delight.  I am nearly transported to the days of old Hollywood, when people had nannies and rode elevators.  This is surely out of my element, but tonight, I'm self medicating, without the alcohol or Mexican quaaludes.  The bone in ribeye was near sheer perfection, with a taste that eschewed my typical topping of gefilte fish with cream.  The Thai green beans were a lil spicy, and a lot of fun.  And I'm pretty sure my Spidey senses were tingling thanks to some green Chile in the taters.  You know... PO-TA-TOES... boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew",

    "text": "My wife and I were in town for a family wedding and decided to look for a steakhouse during our visit. We originally were looking for a local restaurant or one not available to us in our local area. We did not have much luck between closed(11/26/18 - Monday night) or not very good reviews so we drove to Fleming's. I will have preface that I dined at a location in LA several years ago with my mother and was disappointed and have never returned. On with our dining experience. We were greeted warmly and seated promptly. (again a Monday night). We were equally warmly greeted by our server, Zoe. We were given ample time to review the both the wine/cocktail menu and the food menu. Zoe went over our options and we placed our orders. We ordered salads to start, Caesar and the Wedge and both were very nice and served promptly. My wife ordered the petite filet med rare and I ordered the bone in ribeye, also med rare. My wife's ordered was cooked perfectly and both entres came out timely EXCEPT that I was brought the incorrect ribeye, boneless. I politely pointed out the error....from there we were both amazed at the response and treatment we received. Zoe quickly corrected the oversight(after rechecking her notes) and the correct ribeye was out quickly and cooked to perfection. Zoe and the mgr both apologized though I did not complain only pointed out that it was the incorrect steak. No fuss....Marc Flatley was the mgr on duty and also bought a round of the wine that we were drinking which was much appreciated though not expected. Fleming's also brought out an additional side with my steak. We were quite content with the amount of food we had! We enjoyed an exceptional meal and will put Fleming's back on my rotation of steakhouses. We both truly appreciate both Marc and Zoe going above and beyond for us. If you are in Chandler I highly recommend them as your choice when looking for a steakhouse for both service and dining experience...Ask for Zoe's station!!!",

I found a lovely wine on their great wine list and my husband went with a wine recommended by the server which he enjoyed. We both had steak which was cooked as requested and to perfection. If I was to be picky, I would say the side dish of fries I had did not justify the $10 price charge. For dessert I had cheesecake which is the best I've had in a long, long time. Again the staff recognised my birthday and the cheesecake had a candle on it. When we were paying the bill I was given a lovely box of truffles and a gift voucher. Yes, it is expensive but if you have an event you are celebrating they do go that extra yard to make it a memorable occasion for you :-)",

The salads followed we had the Caesar (great flavor) and Flemings (very bland). This is where the bad starts my husbands NY strip was cooked properly but mine and my friends were not I ordered med rare ( I received med well) my friend ordered med (got med rare) I sent mine back, the server was not happy with that. After 15 min I got my new steak done right, at this point the rest of the table were finished eating so we ordered dessert and reminded our server we wanted a meal to go and our check because we had to leave soon. She seemed very busy and I had to flag down another server to pay our bill, after 25-30 min we finally had our meal and could leave. Bottom line I think next time we want a good steak we'll go to the Scottsdale location or City Hall!",

Our visit lasted exactly 5 minutes.  That was long enough to have a seat at the bar and have the snobby bartender treat us like lepers for deigning to ask questions about the specials.  Judging by his terse and unhelpful answers, you're either in their little Happy Hour club and already have the options memorized, or you're out, so don't bother him.    I don't know if the bartender is trying to apply the Jehovah's Witness Heaven Limit to the number of people allowed to enjoy Fleming's Happy Hour, or if he was annoyed that he couldn't carry on an uninterrupted conversation with a coworker about scheduling work hours, or if he's just a knob, but we were interested in having a nice little time out, not cracking some bartender-induced secret code of Happy Hour enlightenment, so we got up and left.  We went across the lot to another restaurant and were treated to friendly service, great food, and good drinks, at a real Happy Hour with happy people.",

Bread was slightly dry and tasteless.  Creme Bruelle was great, but the berries looked worn out.  Had a reservation for a booth....younger manager placed us at a table in the middle of the restaurant since it was first come, first serve for seating according to him.  We were puzzled.  There were lots of tables along the walls, but we got the table in the center.  It was loud.  With that being said, I think eating a 5 pm is a good idea if you need a booth for privacy and quietness.  Next, do not eat their specials.  They are average.  Order off the main menu.  Last, the Chocolate Volcano cake is average.  It is not worth the extra time or money.  If in doubt about where you are seated, get up and leave.  We will do that next time.  Why make a reservation if the requests are ignored?  Tonight was an average meal at a noisy restaurant.  I can get that at Outback for less money and their quality is often better than Flemings!",

    "text": "I agree with David M and Ada G. regarding the service in the bar. If you go here, do not dine in the bar. The hostess might tell you its full service at the bar but the service at the bar is noticeably lacking. If you have a choice between waiting for a table and eating at the bar, eat at the table.  We were rushed, not all of our food was packed to go, water not refilled without asking (and waiter never apologized for failing to refill drinks), steak knives were not brought with the food, bread was not brought out without asking, had to ask for refill on wine (since when has a waiter not asked for refill on alcoholic drinks)...all of the usual amenities that are provided at table service was severely lacking at the bar.  The other aspect that annoyed me was that I asked for fried onion strings or straws on my steak and asked if they could prepare it. The server immediately got defensive and acted as if I was asking  foie gras on the side. Instead of simply responding with \"It shouldn't be a problem, I'll see what we can do\" His response was remniscient of a server at Applebees \"Well since we don't offer that item on the menu, I just don't know if they can make that\" Seriously, was I dining at Black Angus? It's called common sense, I can understand that response if I was asking for something other than fried onion strings. Very amateur to say the least!  The food itself is amazing at this location. They reall cook steaks well and if you order a medium, it comes perfectly cooked with mostly pink inside and just a little charred on the outside. It's one of the few places that really understand what a medium steak is and they don't overcook it like most places.  I like their steaks better than many more well known places including Donovans and Ruth Chris.  The service needs to improve even at the tables. You don't receive that royal treatment like you do at other upscale steak restaurants including Ruth Chris, Donovan's etc. I can understand that type of service if I'm dining at Outback Steakhouse but we just spent $167 for two and were formally and professionally dressed yet we were rushed as if we were eating at Chipotle during lunch rush hour.  The service needs to improve especially for a fine dining establishment. The basics like refilling drinks, smiling, addressing people as sir/mam, apologizing if items are forgotten are basic elements of good service at a fine dining restaurant yet it was lacking here. If you want an example of great service, go to Durants",

    "text": "This was the second time I've been to Fleming's. Both times have been very enjoyable. This time, a friend told me about a bar special called 5 for 6 'til 7. It is five menu items (mixed drinks, wine, appetisers, etc. for $6 until 7 P.M.). You can still order off the menu, but the specials are only available in the bar, and tables are available in the bar area. Everything we ordered was excellent. I had the steak sandwich (another bar special), which was terrific. If you are a wine drinker, don't go to Fleming's if you are thirsty. The amount of wine they serve (a friend ordered a glass of Merlot) for $6 is ridiculous. They bring a huge glass for the wine, and a little carafe of wine, barely enough to wet the inside of the glass. Stick with the mixed drinks or beer. For you beer drinkers, beer is only available in bottles. No beer on tap, which is a shame for a restaurant of this caliber. Hopefully, when the economy improves, Fleming's will continue with some kind of specials, like the 5 for 6 'til 7.",

I ordered a cheesecake to go and they forgot the sauce that went with the cheesecake.  Our bill came to $133.00. Now I'm not sure what part of that experience was worth what we paid. There wasn't anything about the food or the experience that was that spectacular.",

If you enjoy a good steak paired with an excellent wine (they have a huge wine list), you should definitely give Fleming's a try.  I'm an out of towner who travels frequently to Chandler and this restaurant tops my list.",

Had the clam chowder at 13.95 a bowl with a ton of the bread, which is served with 2 great flavored butters (cheesy). Chowder was was very good, not overly rich with cream like some places. Had the 12 oz filet medium rare with the fleming potatoes (yum!), Brussel sprouts, and some shoestring potatoes (very crispy).Everything was great, with the steak done perfectly.Of course at these prices you should expect that. I have had the chocolate lava dessert before, but this time shared the carrot cake for dessert, both are excellent. Another nice prime steak dining experience.",

The appetizers and sides come in decent sizes as well. Their bread served with two different cheeses is delicious. When your food comes out, it's literally still cooking from the plate, which is great- shows that it's fresh. I would say to order your meat one above what you would usually - so instead of medium rare, get a medium. I get bad to send my steak back, but they did it without a hassle and were so kind. Bottom line up front, the steak is always fresh (juicy and flavorful), pricey, but worth it.",

I stupidly thought it would be priced in the same realm. Nope, 17 bucks. I find that super annoying. I mean the food was good but really? 17$ for three pieces of bacon? It was clear we were there for happy hour, were looking at the happy hour menu. Seems to me something should have been said. I will not be back. The Keg is much better anyway.",

    "text": "I came here recently for a special occasion dinner with my office staff and it was very nice.  The restaurant itself is well designed, with muted colors, dark woods and dimmed lighting.  The wait staff was neatly presented in crisp white shirts and clean, black service aprons.  We prearranged for a pre-printed dinner menu that was labeled as being for our party that night.  I thought that it was a nice touch, and I am well aware that it was also a clever cost containment measure since it also kept our staff from wildly ordering off of the regular Fleming's menu.  Our servers were all very gracious and attentive and took very good care of our party of about 25.  Our food was all brought out at the same time, which was no small feat on the kitchen's part.  Everyone seemed genuinely happy with their food, I didn't see anyone complaining about anything.    I ordered the petite filet, medium rare, and it was absolutely perfect in every way.  The meat was cooked perfectly and was tender, moist and delicious.  There were various sides served 'family style' raging from buttered corn to asparagus, and they were all very good as well.  As a dessert I ordered creme brulee, and it was deliciously creamy with the perfectly sugar crust on top.  My only complaint about my food, and it is minor, was that the creme brulee wasn't the ice cold temperature that I usually prefer.  I like my creme brulee pre-fired so that it has time to cool off before I eat it.  I don't care for warm custard, but it's purely a personal preference and I still thought the dessert was fantastic.  The only other thing I would point out is that many people aren't fans of the a la carte menu system, it can be annoying, and ridiculously expensive, to order every side dish seperately from the main entree.     That said, this was still a great experience in a wonderful restaurant.  I highly recommend it for any special occasion dinner as long as your budget will allow it.",

It was incredibly stringy and tough to the point of being impossible to eat. To their credit, once I complained they brought out two new cuts that were very good. Cooked perfectly and tender although under-seasoned. But it made me wonder about how those initial cuts could get through the quality control process. I mean, they were ridiculously awful.  I thought about it being the $29 prime rib special and that's what they give people and then hope they don't complain, but I don't think they would play with their reputation like that. On the plus side, the Flemings potatoes, bread, salad and cheesecake were awesome, but it's time we try a different steakhouse.",

    "text": "09/01/10  My first, and (so far) only, visit to Fleming's.  I give it 2.5 stars...  First thing I noticed was that it was very dark inside- a pet peeve of mine.  Second, the service looked either harried or aloof.  Where were the smiling faces?  It was 4:15 pm, which meant the doors had just opened 15 minutes ago, and there weren't many guests yet waiting to be seated.  (There were about eight people at the bar area.)  I soon met my server, whose cold gaze and unsmiling face already had me thinking maybe this place was not such a good idea.    After studying the menu, I decided I'd try the Prime Burger for $6. I also asked if I could sample a couple of red wines before ordering a glass of one.  I've been to many venues where this is not a problem, and sometimes, when I can't decide, even willingly offered!  This Fleming's location isn't one of these venues.  My query brought about a more negative change of attitude from my server, but I did get to try two very small samples before choosing a glass.  While I waited for the burger to arrive, I began to boot up my laptop- thank goodness I brought it, bec. the burger took a long time...  The bar area was filling up fast, and the servers started to look even more agitated that I was starting to wonder what was all the fuss?  Finally, just under 20 minutes later, my beautiful burger arrived.  Huge patty, smothered w/ cheese and topped w/ thick-cut, peppered, and smoked bacon, tomato, onion, lettuce, and a pretzel bun.  The one huge onion ring was a nice touch.  The burger was juicy (cooked to my specified medium), quite substantial, and delicious w/ the cheddar, veggies, and bun.  The thick-cut bacon, however, was so salty, that I had to take the slices off!  I was a bit disappointed, since it was such a hearty portion of bacon.  I wouldn't mind having another Prime burger, minus the bacon, for happy hour again, but I'd choose another location.   BTW, as I was enjoying the burger, I finally figured out why all the harried faces and the servers' hustle and bustle-- it seemed like everyone in the bar area had chosen the burger!  The table of six in front of me all had burgers... At $6, it's a steal for diners, but perhaps not expensive enough to garner a nice tip?  Hmm... well, not if the servers' attitudes continue to be cold and distant!",

But we never had a chance considering he never came back to ask if we wanted another wine or beer...very unwelcoming and we felt like we were a nuisance after a table of 6 were sat just beside us. My husband had to go to the hostess station to ask for a check. Considering the average prices for dinner at Flemings, I would expect better service. We have had beyond better service at local places as well as high priced. Texas Star in San Diego comes to my mind.",

    "text": "If you're looking for that ultimate Fleming's experience you've saved up months for - don't bother coming to this location. Please make the drive up to Scottsdale where the standard seems to be a lot higher than here.   It's pretty packed during Happy Hour but because of that, I get the feeling that the servers in the bar and patio area know they're getting shafted with probably lower than expected tips thus, lower customer service. I sat on the patio for dinner and was not expecting to spend my night constantly waving at the server like I was at dim sum - not here of all places.   Food is great and pretty much on par with other locations, but the service here is like nails on a chalkboard. We sat on the patio and if you order anything other than water, don't expect the server to come by and give you another refill. It's best you measure out your sips for the rest of your dinner. In the time it took to get another beer, you would have sworn they were self-brewing in the kitchen because that's how long it took. Asked for bread service but it never came, even after our entrees came and we asked a third time. What was pretty irritating was that all the other parties who sat down after us in the same area were getting great service, refills, bread, etc. They were all bigger parties and ordering wine glass after wine, so I had a guess as to why he would baby their tables and not ours. Regardless, never in my wildest dreams did I think that my childhood dream of being invisible would come True, but this server definitely made sure of it. Not as exciting as I thought it would be.   We told the manager what was going on and all he could say was that our server had 7 years of experience and was amazing at what he did. If only I had a manager that could say such amazing things about me while I ignored all my responsibilities at work and watched YouTube all day. The manager offered us free dessert, but it didn't really matter to me especially since I did not come for dessert. I came for the upscale ambiance and opportunity to wow the company I was with. I thought I was at Fleming's and left feeling like I was at Chili's.",

It gives off a classy and elegant feel without being too pretentious.    The bread that was given at the beginning was average.  Hard on the outside and soft on the inside.  It was the butter that was taken me by surprise.  There was a chiptole butter and also a sour cream butter.  The chiptole butter was the best.    I chose a Chilean sea bass with sauteed spinach.  It was a flakey and stringy texture as a great bass would have.  The bread crumbs on top added a nice crunchy texture for contrast.  It was a fresh fish which didn't have a fishy taste, but not as good of a taste as expected.  My friend had the filet mignon with crab on top and scallops on the side.  The scallops were the best.  Not too bouncy and cooked just right.  The crab has a mediocre taste.  Something common like it can be made at home.  The filet is tender deep red meat and not that flavorful because of the lack of fat.  And again, it was average.  The dessert was the best part of the meal.  The chocolate lava cake with REAL whipped cream.   The warm rich chocolate center with vanilla ice cream and pistachio on top added to the whole cake.    Overall the food was pretty good, but the value isn't.  For as much as it costs, I would be expecting something better.",

Who doesn't hate those bartenders/servers that sell you on terrible products just because they are more expensive?   Now let's talk about the food. Always cooked to order and promptly served. You never get the feeling that YOU, the guest, are bothering the staff. Maybe that is just at the bar, but hopefully it extends to the whole restaurant!!! They have a fantastic happy hour from 5-7, then have ANOTHER one from 8-10!!!! The second is a little more expensive but sooo worth it!!! I will continue to dine and suggest other do the same.",

    "text": "First review I've decided to write for a restaurant so far, but felt I had to after reading dozens of reviews prior to coming in, with certain expectations that were not met, and feeling that I wish someone had written what I'm going to write.   To start off, I'd like to come out and say we did not make it past a round of drinks here. This review is strictly related to the \"experience\", or in our case, lack there-of. We left after 30+ minutes, in large part due to the large gaps in time between the server coming back to check on us.  Our unfortunate experience was rather short, so I'll try to keep it to the point. It was the wife and I's 4 year anniversary. I made same-day reservations for a Friday night (9/5) at 7:15. We pulled up and used the valet out-front, which was nice. We walked in and were seated within a few minutes. So far, so good. We were seated at a 4-top in the middle of what I can only describe as a cattle yard. Everyone seemed so close together, with booths surrounding the room, apparently the only good seats in the house. The wife likes to sit next to me, so I thought I'd ask to switch. Upon getting up to request a booth, I was told they had already sat it... Oddly enough, said booth wasn't sat for another minute or two after I had returned to my seat. Not a big deal, as the experience I was hoping for could easily make up for it.   I returned to my seat in time to greet our server (40+ yo woman) who had only been there briefly. Rather than offering her name, all she said was \"Cocktails?!\". My wife said she was interested in a glass of wine, and asked for a possible suggestion. The server handed her an iPad to look through instead of, ya know, imparting knowledge that a seasoned server should do at a \"fine dining\" establishment. We told her we'd need a few minutes to look through the cocktail list, and upon her return she then asked us if we're interested in hearing the specials for the night. I wanted to cut off her butchered attempt at telling us the features, but didn't have the heart to do so.  Their beer/wine menu does not allow one to discern if the beer is draft or bottled. So, while I did not ask, I was not told how the beer I ordered would come, but at least my $7 bottled beer was delivered with a glass. My wife ordered a glass of wine, and at that point, I handed the server my card when she asked if we'd like to start with any appetizers. Clearly knowing something was wrong, she bleakly stated, \"Oh, just the drinks? But it's your anniversary! I hope it's not something we did.\" and walked away.  The way she said it, she clearly could not care less and seemed glad for us to be leaving. I'm under 30, so maybe she assumed we were cheap. Both my wife and I have worked before in the restaurant industry for a combined 12+ years. We left a 50% tip to dismiss any conclusion on their part that we are \"cheap.\"  While I am sure the food is great, as that's all the other reviews seem to cover, if you are looking for an intimate restaurant to visit with your significant other and are looking for a level of service that is on par with the price, then dine elsewhere. I personally am not willing to pay $50+ for a steak and $10 for a baked potato if the level of service I receive is that of a 2am visit to Denny's. I've only been in AZ a year, so perhaps the bar is much lower here for fine dining than it is in Seattle (El Gaucho, Palisades, Canlis, Daniel's Broiler, Salty's, etc).   Very discouraging visit for our first time. We won't be back.",

    "text": "Once again my wife and I made our annual pilgrimage to Flemings for our anniversary. This place is upscale and pricy, so we only go here for this special occasion. The food here is extraordinary. Why else would we go to a dimly lit high priced restaurant? We had reservations for 5:30 on a Sunday. We usually go on Sundays because that is when they have prime rib, (my favorite).   I started my meal with the French onion soup. The soup has bold beefy broth loaded with onions topped with melted gruyere and parmesan cheeses. Piping hot and gooey, the cheese compliments the onion soup well. Next I was served a salad of my choice. I tried the new wedge salad for the first time. This will be my standard choice in the future. The head of lettuce was quartered into a wedge hence the name new wedge. The salad was topped with slab-cut bacon, blistered tomatoes, crumbled gorgonzola, pickled red onion, toasted pepitas, danish blue cheese dressing. The salad was crisp and creamy, tart and tangy all in the same bite.  The main course I chose was the prime rib dinner with a side of Fleming potatoes. The Fleming potatoes are a perfect side to go the prime rib. Potatoes made with cream, jalapenos and cheddar cheese baked to perfection into a loaf. The creamy slightly spicy flavor compliments the salty savory flavor of the prime rib and any of the 3 accompanying sauces.  The highlight of the meal was of course the prime rib. Cooked to medium rare and served with a trio of sauces, au-jus, drawn butter, and horseradish sauce. The outside was crusted with cracked pepper. It was a generous cut of meat. I was only able to eat half. I wanted to save room for dessert so I had the other half boxed to go.  Dessert was walnut turtle pie consisting of homemade caramel, walnuts and chocolate baked in a chocolate pie crust. This dessert is rich and decadent, the perfect finale to a great meal.  Because it was our anniversary and we stated so on our reservation we received a $25.00 Flemings gift card which we put toward our bill. We still paid a lot for the meal, but it is worth it for the quality of the dining experience. Flemings will continue to be our anniversary tradition for years to come.",

I guess that means that all they cook good is the steak because the $44 pork tomahawk was far from it. Dry, under unseasoned,  the server recommended that they butterfly it to be best cooked but it may had caused it to be dry, i kept adding salt and pepper to different parts of it, i my self dont eat salt as much. Honestly i felt ripped off and i wasnt the only one . My wife and company enjoyed their food aside from the salmon and chicken, but for the $ we spent there and the expectation of an awesome and delicious meal was far from it. I guess if I'm spending $44 for a dry and almost tasteless piece of meat is the norm. For this being my first time and it being so hyped up it fell far from it, the one thing i did enjoy was the cold beer and tasty dessert.",

Though the prices have gone up over the years, it is still a decent deal for what it is. We started with the Blueberry Lemon Drop Martinis which were refreshing and tart with just a little sweetness. The calamari was good, but too much sauce made it soggier than preferred. We also tried the crab cakes, which to my surprise were some of the best I've had! The prime burger is always good, though the brioche bun and pepper bacon are what really shine through, and always get their onion rings (way better than their fries). Lastly my sister got the flatbread on the 567 menu. I didn't try it, but she said it was delicious. Only downfall besides the increased prices would be that the lighting is so dim in the bar are you can barely see the people sitting in front of you. Will be back for sure, but probably not anytime soon.",

The chop salad was supposed to have root vegetables and Parmesan and it did not. My steak was ordered medium, but it was tough and overdone. The grand finale was watching the staff set up table settings, dropped a bread plate, knife and salad fork on the floor, picked it up and continued to finish dressing the table with the setting that dropped on the floor. Won't be back to this location. Disappointing.",

Also both of the prime burger buns were burnt. Overall, the seasoning of the food was substandard. The highlight was the excellent wait staff. Special shout out to Eric who was attentive yet unobtrusive.  He made the experience special for an otherwise disappointing meal.",

    "text": "Very interesting.  We've been to this Fleming's on several occasions, and tonight seemed to be a continuation of the progression downhill for this restaurant, in my opinion.  We decided to make this a family of four dinner, bringing our 10 and 12 year olds.  Obviously, we tried to stick with steak at this steak house.  We came at opening, about 5pm, arriving at 4:50.  They did have us wait until they were ready at 5pm, and that's okay.  The opening, though, plays a big part later in this review.  We stuck with water, as you can run up a really high bill very quickly.  Our orders were taken late (about 15 minute wait)  because we had not ordered drinks, and the waiters were busy brining out wine, etc, to the other tables.  The bread was fresh, but the butter was not.  It was dried out, like it had been frozen, and we were served the freezer burnt butter.  I asked for the Crab Cake appetizer to be brought out at the same time as everyone else's plate.  This was screwed up, and was brought out early.  So everyone else had to watch me eat.  I was having this as a \"small plate\" dish.  The boys had the specials, which were a petite filet mignon along with 3 scallops.  We asked for medium--they were undercooked, more along the lines of rare to medium-rare.  The scallops were well cooked, but a little bland.  The 10 year old did not like them, and he usually really enjoys seafood.  I added on the Chipotle Cheddar Macaroni and Cheese for the kids, which they liked, along with Half and Half, which is shoestring fries with Onion Rings, both tasted okay.  My wife had the Double Thick Pork Rib Chop.  The sauce was very tasty, BUT the pork was underdone, and was visibly raw in the middle.  This was unacceptable.  We had to send the plate back, which was put under the broiler, and then brought back to us.  I have to say this is the second time in a row that my wife's meat was raw at this Fleming's.  I would've chalked it up to oven not being hot enough for the first dishes, but this seems to be a recurrent problem.    I had a small plate, the Sliced Filet Mignon, which is served on Risotto.  The meat was very well done, but the risotto was completely dried out and tasteless. I was very disappointed.  As it took about another 10-15 minutes between when our plates were taken away and our waiter came with the dessert menu, we had decided to skip dessert and coffee and make our way to Starbucks, about two buildings away.  I'm willing to forgive the delays due to them just opening up.  Plus, it was Veteran's Day.  However, the food being underprepared for the second time in a row is unforgivable, especially for as expensive a restaurant as Fleming's is.  This is really starting to feel like a \"chain\" restaurant as it really is rather than an exclusive steak restaurant, which they strive to be.  Overall, I think we're done with Fleming's.",

Also, no one noticed us after 10 minutes to ask if we wanted anything to drink... This is going to sound silly, but an appetizer said pork belly fried appetizer served with cranberry sauce, needless to say I didn't realize that was pure fat on a plate ( most places don't serve pure lard on a plate for a snack)  and I told the waiter that it was not to my liking and he seem to be disgusted by it. This place for the amount of money you pay, I am surprised by the crappy customer service and the food was nothing to brag about. I guess I'll have to make a trip back to Cali for some good food!!!!",

    "text": "After my last review Fleming's manager, Miguel, gave me a phone call expressing his apologies for our less than stellar experience and invited me to come back.  I was a bit shocked by the phone call but also very grateful.  Fleming's obviously takes their customer satisfaction very seriously and it made mew feel good knowing that time was taken to care about how I was feeling.   Words cannot express how amazing our revisit was.  Linda's service was impeccable and I would highly recommend asking for her section next time you go.   I ordered the Mozzarella and Tomato salad, what a vision of loveliness it was (see pics) and it tasted just heavenly, the mozzarella melted in my mouth and the tomato's were so sweet and juicy along with that spicy basil I would have been happy just stopping there.   For my entree I decided to try the Barbecue Scottish salmon Fillet.........WOW!!  Absolutely incredible! This is bar far the best item I've ordered here and is now my new favorite. (see pics) It's sweet and slightly crisp BBQ glaze had me yearning for more.   Now I haven't ordered mashed potatoes from Flemings in years since they took their horseradish mashed potatoes off the menu, but let me tell you after trying their Parmesan peppercorn mashed potatoes I soon forgot my long lost favorite, these ones were to die for!!!  Perfectly creamy, thick , buttery and seasoned to perfection I will be ordering these from now on most definitely!   My husband's usual order of chipotle mac and cheese and a medium rare fillet was no exception to the excellence, he reveled in every bite!   What a total surprise it was when Linda brought him a Creme' Brulee with a candle to re-celebrate his Birthday!  That my dear friends is attention to detail and absolutely made us feel very special and quite frankly made our night!   Our entire evening was flawless from first bite to last.  I can't Thank Miguel and Linda enough for taking such good care of us and we will without a doubt continue dining with you.  You won back my heart and I must say you deserve 5++++++ stars!!",

You know every time you go there you will receive first rate service and 5 star food.  There is not a bad item on the menu there and the steaks are fantastic.    The only thing I would say the location lacks is the bar.  While they do have one, it is very small and gets full quite quickly.  We would love to go there more to enjoy some of the food on the happy hour menu but given how it is set up, we opt for other locations.  The dining room itself is very spacious and representative of a high end dining experience.    One thing that always cracks me up there is how they offer to carry my drink for me when walking me to be seated in the dining room.  May have to actually do that sometime....",

    "text": "I am giving this 3 starts,  because the Lady at the Front desk, really needs to drop her Attitude. You don't go to an expensive place like Fleming's, to get Attitude from their staff. If our Money is not good enough to her, we would gladly spend it elsewhere. I told my Husband I wish she doesn't get a share of the tips, because she didn't deserve it. It was Our Wedding Anniversary & we chose this restaurant as we had heard good things about the food. However, the Lady at the front desk was so Rude. She is the face of Fleming's. The first you see even before you have a chance to experience the rest of their staff or their food. Her attitude & rude replies, just put me off. We had a reservation for 7.30 p.m. & thought we would get there around 6.30, so that we can have a drink & hang around for awhile. However when we got their it was packed & the small entrance was full, with no place to stand or sit. I manged to get up to the desk & informed her that we had a reservation. Either she was angry with the crowd their or she didn't like her job. She was just rude & said you have got here an hour ahead. I informed her, that we got there early so that we could get drinks before dinner. To that she just said \"Oh! the Bar area is full\". We got to the end of the Bar Are, near the back door & with a few minutes wait managed to get the attention of the Barman & get ourselves drinks. I had the 'Club Clover' which was so very sour & didn't taste good at all. I had to ask for some Tonic water in it. My Mum was with us too & she couldn't keep standing there much longer. She is 83 years of age. I saw an empty table Outside & I asked her to sit there & I was seated on the ledge outside. The Tables outside were not being used Last night for Dinner, as the weather was bad. The winds were way too strong, with a slight rain & the leaves were in peoples food. A few minutes later, I went up to the girl in the front again & I asked how long it would be before we get a table. I was then Informed by a Gentleman that they were trying to get the guests who were seated outside, in to the Dining area due to the bad weather & it would be a little after our time of reservation. That's fair enough & I was fine with that, as that's the right thing to do. The people seated out there couldn't have their meal in that windy weather & they were there before us & it was fair that they should have a nice meal in peace. I informed the lady then, that I was seated outside & the door was closed due to the wind & if she could inform me when our table was ready. To this she tells me, \"No, You can't sit outside, unless we seat you\". I informed her that the weather was bad, (If she didn't know it already) & that there was no one who wanted to sit outside, except poor us, as we didn't want to stand by the door & get in the way of the servers & my Mum couldn't stand there & keep shuffling around to make space for the servers to walk. I told her I am seated on the Ledge outside. To that she says, \"Ah! Ok\". What is this place? A school? She tells us where we can sit & stand? So we can't sit on the chairs outside, even if there's no one &  they can't use those tables due to bad weather, but it's ok to sit on the Ledge. I was very upset with her & I told my Husband I really don't want to eat here. He was interested in eating there, because he had heard good things about the Steak. Anyway, I told him, I don't want to come here again. They are Rude. The Server RICKY at the Bar was very kind to us & kept looking for space so that my Mum could sit. That's how staff should be.Thank You very much Ricky.  We got our table by 7.30 as promised & I was ok by then as the lady who seated us wished us for our Anniversary & she was nice. Our server MARIE was so very nice. She was friendly & chatty. It was like she knew us all along. It made us feel so very special. All the Servers Attention to detail was amazing. They never left an empty glass on the table, always cleared & cleaned. I informed Marie about the Girl up front. She said she will let someone know about it. But I said it was ok & I was Happy now. Whoever the lady was, up front on Sunday 31st January, Please let her know that she really needs to leave her issues at home & not bring it to work. You can't spoil another persons day because you are not in the mood to be nice. People who come to dinner, come to relax, be happy & Celebrate. Just because it is her place of work, there's nothing we can do about it. I feel bad for her, if she has had a long day. But it was my day to celebrate & be happy & not be served with her Attitude.",

    "text": "Oh how I love restaurant week!  1st stop was Fleming's -- I totally dig the Fleming salad, then again I'm a big fan of cranberries in general.  Their filet I thought was nicely done, when I want medium I want it medium!  As for dessert -- nothing to rave about since it kind of fell flat for me.  Not a huge fan of chocolate over chocolate with some chocolate.... know what I mean?  Service was real good they were attentive and quick.  Ambience was nothing too surprising except I wish I had wore my blazer with a cigar sticking out of my mouth while walking around with a Wallstreet Journal clip under my arm.  Hand me my walking stick Remington!  Overall, it was a good experience and the food was good.  I though I can't recommend becoming a regular especially with today's food price. - Enjoy!",

    "text": "First time going to Flemings and was hoping for a great experience. Unfortunately it felt like the worse financial expenditure in my life. The atmosphere was clean and elegant but the very loud and made it even hard to communicate with our server. Most of us had Chefs Special which was a filet, scallops, and shrimp. Sounds great right. Well the shrimp was tough and the scallops soft and bland more boiled than seared and the steak was well cooked but all was served warm to cold. I love small portions when every bite is exquisite but for mediocre and high prices you might as well serve a larger portion to ensure your guests at least paid for something of substance.   I never plan to return and next time I choose a steakhouse we plan on returning to the Keg. Better atmosphere, service, quality, quantity, and price. Overall a much better value then the over priced Flemings. Next time i will sit at the bar and try one of their burgers instead. I have the review 2 stars because the chipotle Mac and cheese was awesome and the carpaccio was to kill for. Everything else specifically the main courses was money down the drain.",

The male cocktail server did a fantastic job in letting us know of specials and his opinions of the wine and apps and taking care of us--kudos!  Dinner table opened up (20 minutes after our reservation but no big deal at all-- busy).  Megan waited on us and was very good too.  EXTREMELY Loud and Noisy inside (I forgot that since its been years since I was back).  Megan did great at explaining recommendations of all the questions we had w/ the food and wine. Only issue on service was they never brought out our 3 sauces we asked for and were part of the meal.  The steaks $57 and $55 each were good but not fantastic at all and not worth $50+. It seems prices increased about 20% since last time there and not worth it for the good but not great food and the wine prices (happy hour has good prices though).  Spending $250 for two was too high for the food quality we got and the very loud ambience.  Service was very good though other than the bt's.  I'll stick w/ Ruth and Chris, Capital One or Maestros in future.",

John went over the issues I mentioned and invited me back to their location.  I must admit, I was very hesitant. I don't write reviews to receive anything for free, I only write reviews only to warn future customers.  I told John I was unsure if I would be back, but he encouraged me to come back in and allow them another opportunity.  My husband and I decided to go tonight and it was FABULOUS!  Every expectation I had was met this this time!  I would highly recommend Flemings, in Chandler, to anyone I know.   Thank you again John, for taking the time to reach out to me, and to invite us back.  We will be back to your location in the future!!!!",

There pour on glasses of wine are quite small too, no different ounce options. For the prices, go to Capital Grille! Pretty disappointing, especially the waiter with the southern accent giving us attitude for complaining about the soupy creamed spinach and not wanting to order there chocolate lava cake, lol.

We got seated right away with the awesome Jason and Julia waiting on us. The Calamari, Mushroom Ravioli and Crab Cakes were amazing. Jason recommended a  Merlot from their iPad wine list and it was great. The New England Clam Chowder and the Caesar Salads with the anchovies were fresh and tasty. Bread was warm and replenished right away.  Entrees were cooked perfectly with juicy NY strip steaks  and big scallops, served hot. The side garlic mashed potatoes were delicious. For dessert we got the Creme Brule with the chantilly cream and it was to die for. The manager Bruce stopped by to wish the anniversary couple and see how we were doing, and our waiter presented the couple of the evening with a box of truffles and a $25 gift card, which was a very nice and classy touch. Great ambiance, fantastic food and wonderful attentive service. I have eaten at the Scottsdale location and this one is just better and warmer. Thank you so much.",

The atmosphere was as I expected, although I was a little surprised that some people dressed more casually than I would have expected.   The service was excellent. The waiter took our drink order and brought a loaf of bread that came with two spreads - both were excellent! One friend and I ordered the petite filet mignon, which was served with Fleming's potatoes. My other friend ordered the regular sized filet mignon with a baked potato. I have never seen a larger potato. My two friends each had a salad - one Caesar and house salad. The salads were each around $9, but good size. The regular filet mignon was $32, while the petite with the potatoes was $26. I didn't really think the regular size was that much larger than the petite.   The steak was phenomenal! I ordered it medium and I can't recall a better steak that I have ever had. It was cooked well, excellent flavor and the perfect size.  The server continued to fill our drinks, brought a second loaf of bread and made sure we had everything we needed.  The total of 3 diet drinks, 2 salads, a baked potato, 1 regular filet mignon and 2 petite filet mignons with the included Fleming potato was $135. Not bad for 3 people. I will definitely come back again.",

    "text": "Had a late lunch/early dinner in the bar area. Even though the restaurant doesn't open until 4pm, the staff will allow you to snag a high-top table/bar stool 15 mins before the grill opens. Service was quick and attentive. Food was of high quality and had a 1990's upscale feel to it, kind of like Cheesecake Factory.  Some of the dishes are a bit overkill, trying to create fancy pairings that seems to backfire...for example: Filet Mignon and Potato Waffle with a demi glace and horseradish cream sauce. These components by themselves are each pretty good, but served together, there were too many competing flavors...and the potato waffle is completely unnecessary vs. a traditional batter waffle.  Also, while The Prime Burger was pretty tasty, I couldn't tell if it was flame broiled vs. just cooked on a griddle. The fries served with the burger were on par with other bar fries, but were thrown for a loop when they threw in a handful of deep fried olives. While that was a pretty bold move, leave deep fried miscellaneous foods to the state fair.  Will definitely give this place another chance, as we only ate in the bar area vs. the main dining room. And, since steak is kind of their niche, I'm hoping more effort is put into the one food that is incorporated in their namesake, Fleming's Prime STEAKhouse.",

    "text": "I came here for one of those financial dinners, which allowed me to invite 3 friends.  I told my friends I wasn't gonna sit with them cos I see them up to 4 times a week, and I wanna meet new people.  i sat with a single lady, and a Korean couple.  The four of us had such a great time talking, that we are going to meet in another week for Korean BBQ.    We all had the 8 oz filet mignon medium rare.  i wish mine was rare as i asked for rare/med rare.  oph well, it was tender, quite gamey tasting, like Ruth Chris' filet, but oddly, filet mignon at The Keg is NOT gamey, not that I mind gamey.    i prefer the Ruth Chris filet because of the butter, ummmm smells soooo good, like frying in butter on your plate.  But the Flemings version was served to us with no meat juices or butter at all.  I thought the meat was rather dry, and wished for something to dip in.  We were given asparagus, which \"was not enough:\" and fortunately the Koren lady asked for more asparagus and they brought another plate, really hot!  Good!  Also had the usual mashed potatoes with the skins, which was quite sticky and gooey.    That caesar salad with crispy proscuitto, quite a small salad, can't believe it costs $12 on the menu.    Bread was not baked crispy enough, if I were not with these other people who already touched the bread i would have sent it back for more baking, or asked for extra crispy.   But our dinner was free to us by our host, so I can't be too vocal not paying for it.    The cheesecake was really really delicious, it was not so heavy and had light berry sauce on top and a dollop of whipped cream.  What is heavy?  TJ's brand of cheese cake is HEAVY TO MEEEEE.  I asked for my cheese cake to go, but ended eating half of it, just couldn't stop.    I really enjoyed the company I was seated with, and service was excellent.  We were in a small meeting room which was well-lit.  I would not have liked to sit outside this meeting room as I like bright lighting on my table.",

My New York strip was cooked to perfection, medium rare as I like it. My companion, for some unaccountable reason in a steak restaurant, had chicken which, in fairness looked great and which he said was delicious. Onion ring sides and what I can only describe as a slab of cream-infused and definitely sinful potatoes left us bloated and satisfied. The accompanying margaritas were, in my view, on the sweetish side but not bad otherwise. I switched to a very nice Pinot Noir. Dinner for two was a relatively expensive $250, including tip, it it was more or less as expected so not complaining, just setting expectations. Special occasions only but really very good.",

We were seated front and center with constant people moving around us. The waiter was nice enough , explained the menu, the butter (changes daily), and was somewhat prompt with service. Steak obviously is the main choice here with one option for chicken, a couple fish options and lobster tail with sides.  Not being a big steak eater and one option for the chicken I picked a few sides with a salad. The asparagus was nothing to write home about. The lobster mac and cheese was ok, the salad was delicious. My wife had the fish and felt it was ok but again have had better at less price. The best part of dinner was the bread and butter to be honest. The prices though were ridiculously expensive and not worth it even at half the price. For a quarter of the price Charlestons is way better. Oh the staff was super nice though.",

I called to make a reservation for a family birthday party of 8 and asked for the small semi-private dining room. The hostess confirmed that the room was available and happily booked our date. Twenty minutes later the manager calls and says unless I wanted to guarantee spending $1300, I couldn't reserve the room. After some discussion I said let me get this straight, that unless I guaranteed to spend $1300 I couldn't reserve that dining area, that no one else has asked for it, and that if no one else does ask for it, then you will just make it part of the main dining area. He said that's right. I told him to keep the room and we would go to Mastro's. He said ok - not even an apology!",

The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because of the atmosphere.  It was very loud. So loud the waiter had to talk even louder and I could still barely hear him. 2 things I noticed that caused this situation was 1 the music in the restaurant was loud and more pop style (It could have been any style of music) and 2 the seating.  Not that full of a night but everyone was seated close together and that makes it so everyone had to talk louder.  Our waiter was just fine and the food was really good. Still though for the price of it I don't want to feel like I'm at a normal family restaurant where I expect it to be loud.

    "text": "Let me begin by saying I'm usually a huge fan of Fleming's. I've gone to the Scottsdale and Lincoln location quite a few times, and have received nothing but stellar service each of those visits. Tonight, I cannot say the same about the Chandler location.   Let's begin by Brittany (our server) coming to take our drink orders... It took close to 20 minutes (18 to be exact) to receive our drinks. We hadn't seen our server and was wondering where she had went, so we had asked a near by server if he can find out where Brittany was because our table was ready to order. Long story longer... A girlfriend of mine had ordered a $155 bottle of Caymus, the server had her sample it, and my girlfriend told the server the wine needed to be filtered. Brittany disregard what we had requested and poured it into a glass pitcher (can't think of the name for container she poured the wine in) and never came back. We finally had to tell the young gal that was helping Brittany serve the table we wanted the wine to be filtered because of the sediment. This gal kept challenging us... Stating why didn't we tell Brittany this in the beginning... And we told her we did, but she never came back to do it. Mind you, there was 3/4 of the bottle left, it was not like anyone drank the bottle and demanded anything for free. My boyfriend who is in the restaurant industry... A GM of a restaurant in North Scottsdale would not have let something like this slip without touching the table. No manager came to touch on the table as this was an on-going challenge of the night. This went on for the majority part of our visit until we watched the manager  go into the wine cellar with our other server to grab another bottle we had requested.   Point is, no one touched the table. Despite of the challenge for the night with the wine, you would've at least expect a manager to come by because no one had taken responsibility for such poor service we left quite disappointed... Can't expect a decent tip if you do not receive decent service. I think holding yourself ACCOUNTABLE is a major issue at tonight's visit. No accountability whatsoever. I highly suggest someone in charge reading, 'Leaders Eat Last'. It's a great read on leadership.   Tonight's visit left a really bad taste in my mouth. Very poor service! Brittany did not return to our table as she left it for the other gal to take care of us. I know how intimidating and frustrating it can be to serve, because I myself have served for 5 years while going through college, but at a place like Fleming's I don't see why you cannot be successful when all the tools you need are right in front of you. Being in the service industry isn't for everyone, it takes a lot of patience, and customer service skills. You work in this industry to be of at service to people no matter how bad a night is going.  Do not have any reasons to return.",

    "text": "Note that I went here for happy hour  I ordered their $6 happy hour burger and at my server's commendation the happy hour carpaccio.  Not sure if it was because of happy hour or not, but the burger I received was sort of small for one with a normal retail of $13.95. Lets break it down into parts.  The bun- fairly dense and hearty bun that soaked up the juices and didn't fall apart on you when eating it. Not really the most flavorful, but a good base for the burger.  The patty- smaller than the bun (not a good sign), seemed to be a coarsely ground and actually really juicy. Just the way I like it, except for one major flaw. I asked for the burger to be cooked to medium, and the burger I received was well done. Not sure I like that an expensive steakhouse overcooked it's beef. The patty was a little too salty too.   Toppings- 2 small pieces of bacon that probably would have made 1 regular sized strip. The lettuce and tomato were cheap though and there was no onion to go with the burger. (reviewing my photo there was onion,  it was just so small and thin that I couldn't taste it). This level of veggies I would expect in a fast food place. Cheese was nicely melted but wish it had a stronger flavor.  Sides- the fries were decent, but the portion once again small.  The carpaccio wasn't that good to me. I liked the toasted Parmesan bread they served with it, but the beef itself didn't seem that fresh to me with a pale color that was starting to turn grey around the edges. Maybe the beef was perfectly fine, but it just didn't look that fresh to me. Of course maybe I just didn't eat it fast enough either. I felt like I liked the carpaccio at Va Bene down the street a bit more.   So why did I give this place a 3 star review although I didn't really think the place was that good? Because I think the price I paid was worth the meal I got, no more no less. Not a value buy like I was expecting, but decent overall.",

They offered to bring me dessert for my birthday, once finding out I was gluten free they provided me with a key lime truffle covered in toasted coconut instead of cake.  Ugh, impressed I was.    The food was remarkable.  Their new Porcini Filet Mignon was out of this world.     Go to Flemming's and enjoy.  The next thing for us to get to is the happy hour.",

    "text": "So here's the thing, had dinner here the other night and the food was very good. I'm a little over steaks cooked in a 1600 degree oven though and would love to find a place where they actually cook steaks over wood so you get the nice charred marks.. nonetheless the food is good, especially the sides. However, the sides are ridiculously overpriced. We tried their lobster bisque which was delicious, but $14.95 for a cup of soup? The crab cake appetizer was $19.95, salads and all potato and veggies are all about $12. Yes you can share and again everything we had was very good, but still...yikes.  Speaking of their steaks, I would say if you order the ribeye be sure and inquire as to how thick it is. My ribeye came out not even an inch thick and looked like a steamed breakfast steak. I did turn it back and they were very gracious about it.  I simply shared with my dinner date which was more than enough and it was fine because really the rest of the food was fabulous.  We had great service and notice a number of Captains walk around making sure everything was going smoothly.",

Drinks arrived on schedule or not unreasonably behind schedule.  I like the wine by the glass and was thrilled to find Colby red blend which I love. The dessert I ordered was not delivered but a couple of minutes later was.   My wife had no problems.  A friend ordered coffee with dessert but they had run out so he had to wait.  Waitress was nice but maybe overwhelmed.  Since we had the Sunday night prime rib special the price was high but not larcenous. This is not priced as high as the top steakhouses but shouldn't go higher.  It is not in the same league.",

This was my third visit to this location and the service level and attentiveness of the wait staff is not on par with other Fleming's or what it should be for the price point.   Perhaps as one of the few upper end dining options in the area, they just can't get a decent staff since the area is cluttered with chain casual dining restaurants.    This place really needs to try harder and step it up and give people a level of service they expect for what they are paying.",

Have dined at Fleming's in other states before and always enjoyed ourselves. 1st big plus is we had a reservation and our table was actually ready. Nothing irks me more than making a reservation and still having to wait 20 minutes for a table.   Service was very good. Our server Megan was very nice and knowledgable. She even called over the manager / sommelier to answer my questions about the wine list.   Food was great. My wife had the small plate scallops and they were outstanding. I had the pris fixe menu petite filet and salmon with the chili lime shrimp appetizer. Also very good and very filling. We finished with the chocolate lava cake. I'm not really a dessert guy, but it was worth it.   The only thing that keeps me from giving this location 5 stars is the bar & happy hour. The bar is very small and absolutely packed every night. Since you can only take advantage of the happy hour specials in the bar it becomes a regular mob scene by 5:00. Management needs to seriously rethink the logistics on this. They're sending a lot of potential customers next door to Roy's and the Sandbar due to poor planning.   All in all a very good experience. We'll be back.",

If you want some great food and drinks on a current economy budget the daily 5-7 happy hr may be a good choice for you.  $5 specialty drinks including a pomitini poured at the table. This drink was quite good and yes girly.  $5 appetizers including a great seared Ahi with a Jicama carrot salad. The Ahi has well spiced and of decent quality.  There are other $5 options as well.  $6 burger that looked huge and induced 2 onion rings and a challa roll for a bun.   There also is a $12 ahi burger that is more of a croquet style with 2 onion rings or a portobello burger too.  This happy hr is available at the bar era, or in the more relaxed patio. There are heaters on the patio for the cooler nights.  With thees prices we kept eating, and eating and yes eating. We left stuffed on great food.  I recommended a side of the saluted mushrooms of the menu as they really enhance any meal.",

For desert I had the cheesecake and it was your typical New York style cheesecake, was delicious and the right consistency.

Flemings I think is grabbing onto the future and running with it! For their wine list, they will hand you an ipad which then you may procede to search their over 100 varieties and choose a glass or bottle to your liking. What is so neat too is the fact that each wine has a flavor profile description - so much better than having your waiter try to describe to you each wine or him guessing what you would like.   The food itself was pretty good, a bit peppery...but not overdone or anything (you better not get over done at a place like this) We went on a Sunday which turned out to be a good idea...every Sunday they have a special where you may have a prime rib steak with your choice of side and a salad and dessert for $29.99. Not too bad considering you will pay $25-40 per regular entree.   The ambiance is very classy, service is wonderful (the waiters even have their own buisness cards...weird, huh?) you can't go wrong with Fleming's for a special dinner or even just because. :)",

Burrata, prosciutto, roasted garlic and tomatoes plate and the calamari with roasted red peppers were our apps.  The calamari was just okay, nothing better than at average restaurants.  Burrata (one of my favourite cheeses) had no olive oil or salt on top, very odd.  My entree was a Chilean Sea Bass.  Cooked perfectly and was exceptional ($45).   I asked for no citrus sauce and that was where I was a winner.  The bass was garnished with oranges, with the sauce the dish would be way too sweet.  In addition I ordered the recommended Brussel sprouts.  They were fine but too caramelised to the point of close to chipping my teeth!    My husband's 6 oz petit filet Mignon was cooked medium, he asked for medium well.  Very little if any any seasoning was added.  I personally despise needing to add seasoning to a steak at a steakhouse.",

Timely seating, attentive service, and great ambiance were all spot-on.  But then the calamari and apps came.  I was quickly reminded that I was dining out in a chain restaurant.  Nothing original.  Nothing special.  Nothing unexpected.  My petite filet at $48 could have been better with seasoning.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't stellar which I had hoped for such a pricey little entree.  I would go back, but it wouldn't be my preference when other classic steakhouses like Durant's exist.  If you're looking for a standard steakhouse you'll like Flemings.  Yet, if you want to make it special and tasty go elsewhere.  It's not broken, but they can improve on what's coming off the grill.",

Flemings gives upscale vibes especially when they ask the name of the reservation and if you don't have one they make one for you but overall I felt like it was like an average chain with the \"perception\" of being upscale. Some examples are the reservation system, the valet parking, even though there is tons of parking available a stone throw away and the prices.  I've been to plenty of steakhouses so I know steak can get pricey but for me, it was even pricier and missing that upscale vibe. The decor was okay, lots of people were just wearing casual clothes and our waiter was nice but my steak was just okay. The sauce on it was kind of off, it was a special and the shrimp side I got was almost rubbery which i was disappointed with. My husband got his prime rib as rare as he could get and they delivered on rare, I was surprised how rare it was, but he liked it. Except the top was lightly burned, so he wasn't impressed either.  Overall, if you are looking for an average steakhouse with expensive prices for an average experience, then this is the place for you. I wasn't too impressed but it wasn't bad either, it was okay.",

    "text": "Truly a world-class experience dining at Fleming's this Valentine's Day weekend.   We'd initially made dinner reservations for later in the evening, but needed to change our plans. We arrived a couple hours early and the restaurant was very busy. Despite this, the friendly hostess accommodated us and the staff was able to seat us on their gorgeous heated patio within about 5 minutes of arrival.   Our server, Kennedy, was a ray of sunshine from the beginning. She informed us of their happy hour specials and was great about checking up on us as required. Scott was also great about keeping tabs on our table and was bringing things out at lightning speed!  Over the course of the meal, we had a couple glasses of wine, lobster bisque, scallops, petit filet with truffle poached lobster, loaded baked potato, and for dessert: their stunning chocolate lava cake.   Everything came out fast and fresh. The lobster bisque was rich and creamy with just the right amount of spice and nice, thick chunks of buttery lobster. The scallops were served with a blackened seasoning atop herb and cheese filled phyllo cups. They were slightly underseared, but had a great flavor profile that was incredibly addicting.   The steak was also fantastic. Cooked to a picture-perfect medium, it was juicy and perfectly seasoned. There was a bit of a mixup with the kitchen pushing us out a petit filet oscar (lump crab and bernaise) instead of the truffle poached lobster and caviar we were hoping for. Kennedy was quick to correct this minor misstep, however, and got it resolved without a hitch.   The chocolate lava cake was the cherry on top. At the touch of your spoon, the pillowy cake with a beautifully crusted exterior gives way to an eruption of smooth, decadent dark chocolate filling. The wonderful creamy vanilla ice cream with pistachios its served with makes for the perfect spoonful when combined with the cake. We left absolutely stuffed!  From the friendly hostess to Scott and Kennedy's awesome service to the management staff who checked in with our table and went out of their way to provide us a great experience, we had a perfect date night at this Fleming's location. Highly recommended for a romantic evening out with that special someone.  Pro tip: You can save $25 on $100 or more by checking in!!!",

Second, they eliminated the Sunday night prime rib special, which was both delicious and a great value. Will be back, but we know we would be spending more money if the prime rib was here still.

    "text": "As part of my Happy Hour splurge during the holidays, I decided to stop by Fleming's for the bar to take advantage of the Happy Hour. Great restaurant for dinner and lunch in the past so I thought I'd take advantage of the \"buzz\" for so long about Happy hour in the bar.   The staff I have to say was attentive and personable and it wasn't quite crowded as I expected. Despite coming for HH, I checked out the dinner menu to see if anything new or exciting jumped out. The first thing I noticed, a change in the menu. Initially, I thought it's been that long since my last trip, but realized it wasn't. I decided to hit the Signature Bites and cocktails and had the Surf & Turf Sliders. You can pick 2 for $10 or 3 for $15. I decided to try all 3 which consisted of Filet mignon, crab cake, and lobster. To drink I went with the Blueberry Lemon Drop  The drink set the bar high as I watched him prepare and it was delicious. It was $9 and I realized that I could drop 3 of these jokers down with no problem. When the food came out, my buzz tapped me on the shoulder and said: \"what's that\"?? The 3 sliders arrived.  They were decent, but nothing to keep me coming back for (esp with the price). Maybe I was expecting some \"garnish\" or fries\" with it to round it off.. Yes, I know it's the higher grade steakhouse (over Outback) but I think they could take it up a notch to improve the Happy Hour menu. I will return for dinners but not",

The wine was excellent at a reasonable price and the food really good.  Service was the best.  Fast forward, we moved to Chandler.  We decided to give Fleming's a go.  We won't be back.  The happy hour wine was $14 and the pour was small.  We witnessed a server tell the bartender he was under-pouring and he then made corrections.  My husband's burger was fine.  My sliders were the worst.  The small buns were cold and hard.  I sent them back and they grilled thrm slightly, still hard, old, and cold.  The meat was cold.  The lobster tasted like old fish salad. I was really surprised by the crowd.  Must be the holidays and economy.  It surely is not the product or average Yelp reviews.",

We had a reservation and were seated right away in the dark and fairly crowded room. Our table seemed exceptionally small for our party of four, which made dish and glass placement a little tricky, and during the evening my chair was bumped a few times by the waitstaff and guests because the tables were so close together. We started with crab cakes, slab-cut bacon, and lobster bisque, all of which were quite good.  There was a mix up with my drink order, and even after attempting to correct it, I still received the wrong drink. Then, we waited and waited and waited for our entrees.  3 of the 4 steaks were ordered medium well, 2 of which arrived medium rare.  After the long wait, we were in no hurry to send them back.   Our favorite sides were the chipotle mac and cheese and the Fleming's potatoes, which don't look particularly appetizing when they're served in a rectangular brick, but which tasted fantastic!  We could have passed on the Yukon mashed potatoes and asparagus we ordered as neither were particularly remarkable.    We finished off with creme brulee served with whipped cream and fresh berries, which came out right away and was just as wonderful and creamy  as I remembered it being here.  Overall, the dinner was nice, but it didn't feel quite like the celebration dinner we'd hoped for.",

My main course was the special for the night. Small lobster tail and a small bacon wrapped  filet. A bit of advice, I asked how was their medium rare and the staff stated red in the middle. I went with medium and it was a bit overcooked but still a good filet. With a small cut like that it cooks very fast so I would go with the medium rare next time.   I will be back again.",

After years of going to Flemings this might be the final visit - sad but overpriced, mediocre menu choices leave me with no other choice  One choice of butter vs  the usual 2 choices?  No onion rolls? No Flemings salad??  We hope you get it back together but the recent trend is not promising   I get it you're  cutting costs but your killing revenues  Will take a miracle for me to go back  This place is very tired, and losing grasp of what customers really loved about the old Flemings  We were told there is a new president and if this is the result, be prepared for yet another new president shortly",

This is the ultimate date location when you want to look your best for your husband or wife.  I think everyone knows that you should expect a bill of over $100 here. It's nice to splurge every once in while on a nice bottle of wine or at least an expensive glass or 2.  However, if you are in the 50 to $60 per plate per person range, you don't really get much. I ordered The rib eye and my wife ordered the fillet with a side of brussel sprout.   The sprouts were amazing let me just say that.  The steaks were a little underwhelming.   All we got for the stakes was a plain piece of meat on a white plate. No garnishes, no sauces offered, just meat on plate.   Each was very tasty karma but in a societee where we eat with our eyes, I was a little disappointed.  Perhaps next time we will up our budget to $100 per person and get something we are not disappointed in",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to a great night to celebrate and have a great night.   We were disappointed and the experience ruined what was supposed to be a great Saturday night.  We had reservations and were seated immediately in a great booth. Our waiter was friendly and we got off to a great start. Two cocktails, French onion soup and a shrimp cocktail to start. So far so good. Then we ordered a wedge salad, a steak each, two sides and two glasses of wine. I would not recommend using the electronic device to pick out wines as it was super confusing and looking at the wines on the printed menu was definitely easier. He ordered his steak medium and I ordered mine medium rare. When they arrived, the tip of his was medium but the rest was rare at best. Mine was underdone as well although not as much. There was literally a pool of blood on his plate by the time we finally got the waiter back to our table after flagging another waiter to get him. We were embarrassed (because how are you supposed to have to do that at a place like this) but sent it back. A manager stopped by and said he understood it was under cooked and we explained the situation. He listened but it felt a little patronizing. What came back looked like a hockey puck. At that point, we just told them they could take it away. We were so embarrassed that we just asked for the check and wanted to leave. Our night was ruined. And we somehow felt like it was our fault. They removed that steak from our check and a round of cocktails but our check was still $200. I received an email survey that I completed after the experience and still have heard nothing. The steaks were the only problem with our meal but we were at a STEAK HOUSE. How is that what they screw up?!??!?!?! And why did we feel like it was our fault the meal wasn't as we ordered it? We've had MUCH better meals at The Keg and plan to keep it that way. A HUGE disappointment and we won't be back.",

Not because others aren't excellent, but just because Nikky is extraordinary.   We visited with a group of 4 - 2 of my colleagues, and a senior level client. We were exceptionally obnoxious, and Nikki was brilliant, walking a tightrope of give and take good humor and unrivaled customer service.   We all had an absolute blast and the food was wonderful. We had the seafood tower for 4, and two of us had the petit fillet medium rare and a lobster tail.   The fillet was cooked perfectly - slightly charred on the outside and pink, warm and tender in the center without being chewy.   The seasoning was right on, adding the right amount of savory while allowing you to taste the perfection of the quality cut of meat.   The lobster was cooked well - with a hearty substance while maintaining its tenderness.   The Mac n Cheese was some of the best I've had at a steakhouse.   The wine list was extensive and even impressed out super-wine-connoisseur client.   We will definitely be coming back, and Nikky will be serving us.",

The dry aged strip steak was fabulous but the asparagus was overcooked, mushy and just horrible! It was so mushy that the knife couldn't even cut through it. How can you cook a steak just right but screw up something simple as asparagus? It also cost Eleven Dollars, so one would hope to get one's money's worth with a half dozen asparagus stalks. Five star steak dinner and a 0 star side dish on more than one occasion, equals 3 stars.   I'll be back for the steak, but never will I get their overpriced and overcooked asparagus!",

Halibut never really tastes fishy but when you cover it up with a weird white sauce and throw crab on it you might as well put cod on the plate.  Just not what you would expect from a $100+ dollar meal.  Check out the flemmings potatoes though.  It's a glimmer of hope, even though an extremely small portion for a \"family style\" portion.",

Tonight I was served an entire head of nearly raw unseasoned broccoli, two halves a roasted tomato, a few stalks of asparagus and a couple ravioli with no sauce. An entire head of broccoli?? Really? Just because I'm a vegetarian doesn't mean I don't know the difference between good food and a lazy, slap it on a plate if it's green kind of dish. For an upscale restaurant, they should know better. All they would have to do is create a pretty plate comprised of the sides already on the menu and it would be outstanding. So disappointed when the rest of the upscale restaurants in the community are showcasing fresh, delicious vegetable dishes, yet Flemings is falling short with a total lack of understanding of anything other than meat. Otherwise, great wine selection, service and I highly recommend the housemade burrata.",

We were impressed with the young man who valet parked our car (missed his name). Very friendly and enjoyed chatting with him a few minutes. Of course, compliments to the chefs for the best seabass and mashed potatoes I have ever eaten....the cream brulee was so yummy.  Thanks for a wonderful evening... Your staff is awesome....",

The food was outstanding, Main Filet, Dry aged rib eyes, petit filet ... all cooked to perfection. Yet I feel like the service was that of a cheap corner restaurant. Party of four, and the server's attention was directed to only one person. From the wine to the food, Every time he came to check on the table only one person was asked, three of us felt totally ignored, it wasn't until our meals were halfway done that he asked the rest of the table how our food was, with a quick dismissive scan. I felt truly embarrassed with my dad, he was visiting us and we raved about this place, so we took him for dinner there. He is hard of hearing, so I had to ask him a few things regarding his dinner and instead of being sensitive towards this, our server just asked my boyfriend questions, as if he knew what we wanted or needed. Mixed feelings about this dinner - I have been there before and this is the first time it happens!!! I hope the server was just having a bad day, but come on! Is not like the steaks are $9.99, and even if they were you don't make a good name and expect the business out of past reputation. It's an ongoing process. Step up with your server training Fleming's!",

    "text": "This is my first fine-dining experience.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed. I guess I expected a waiter like SpongeBob when he cleared his mind of everything but fine dining and breathing.  But what I got was just a regularly decent wait staff.  Nothing wrong with that, but I thought there'd be an \"experience\" to go along with the price here.  Nope.  We had a party of about 18 for a couple grads in the family.  I will say that we were all given good attention by our waiter, and he did a fine job earning his tip.  Its just that there wasn't anything special about the service that you wouldn't find at Applebee's or something.  The food was an experience, though. I had plenty of time to look the menu over a thousand times (late people, I swear).  The cheapest thing on the menu was in fact on the kids' menu.  But we were there for a special occasion, and it was a steak house that featured....steak.  So I would've kicked myself for ordering anything other than steak.  I may have paid $50 for it, but good lord that rib-eye was the best steak I ever had.  No exaggeration.  Like I said, I've never been to a restaurant like this, so maybe that's why I've never had a steak that good.  And I know there are probably competitors for the best steak in Chandler and the surrounding cities.  But for me, this is as good as its ever gotten.  If there is a steak that tastes better than this, I don't know if I could handle it emotionally.  I'd probably start crying.  I don't have to describe it.  If you eat steak, then you know what a good steak tastes like.  This one tasted like tha; probably better.  Flawless.  Of course, all sides are extra.  I ordered nothing but the meat, as I guess I'm a little too budget-minded for this place.  The pop I ordered took the place of potatos or a salad.    People ordered the lambchops, chicken, sliced filet mignon, crab cakes, and some other stuff.  The only complaint was about the french fries haha.  I didn't try them.  I will say that the wedge salads looked great and were very big.  Also, as far as the amount of food you get, the chicken seemed to offer the biggest portion size.  Honestly though, everybody paid so much for their food that I didn't want to ask anyone if i could try their stuff.  It really is a nice place, too...at least I think so.  The lights are dim so people won't see you frown at the prices.  The napkins are fancy...and so are the ones in the bathroom apparently, as my cuz brought one out to show me.  It is not quiet - but not louder than any other restaurant.  From what I read and hear people say, a fine dining place is supposed to be quiet and stuff.  If that matters to you, perhaps this isn't fine enough for you, because its just like any place else volume-wise.  Perhaps 3 stars is stiffing them a bit.  I mean, my meal was perfect...the service was good...and the ambiance was nice.  Am I just too much of a cheapo?  Did I expect too much of an experience for the price?  Maybe.  But I still feel that everything except the steak could have been just a tad better.  If there is ever another reason to go fine-dining, I'm sure I would suggest some place else instead of coming here again.  I saw what they have to offer...and despite the awesome steak, it just wasn't enough to bring me back.",

On a recent business trip to Phoenix our hosts treated us to dinner at Flemings. We started with an array of appetizers. All very good. For my entree I had the rib eye and I have to say it was perfection! Cooked as I ordered and seasoned perfectly. The mashed potatoes and green beans were very good too. Desert was carrot cake. I'm not a big fan of carrot cake, but as far as they go I'm sure it was great.  The server was attentive and very friendly. Also, I ordered horseradish on the side and he remembered without being reminded. I don't take that for granted anymore.   The location was a bit strange. It's located in a strip mall. I'm accustomed to a Flemings being in cool, unique locations. But maybe it's a Phoenix thing. Everything is located in a strip mall in Phoenix.  I've eaten at Morton's and Ruth's Chris many, many times. Flemings is my new favorite and will have my steakhouse business going forward.",

    "text": "This a review highlighting Flemings Event hosting skills-  I had a luncheon/seminar here on yesterday and was thoroughly impressed with both the outstanding quality of food and excellent service. Flemings was closed to the public during this event because they open at dinner hours. Although the restaurant was not officially opened all of the employees still kept the same level of service as if it was; as a matter of fact I was graciously greeted by a hostess upon arrival. The actual meeting room was sectioned off in the rear of the restaurant, this would make a great place for any after wedding rehearsal dinner, seminar/luncheon, or even possibly an upscale bridal shower. The wait staff was very friendly moved stealthily to each table during the seminar which is very important (nobody wants to hear a bunch of plates clinking when you're trying to listen to a presentation). On to the food! The salad was pre-chosen by the host which was Fresh Mozzarella & Sweet Cherry Tomato- one word to describe it would be \"AMAZING\"! The tomatoes were perfectly sweet and paired so well with the creamy FRESH mozzarella, I literally thought about this dish when I was on my way to sleep for the night. For dinner attendees at the seminar had the choice of chicken, salmon and of course steak. My co-workers and I all decided to try something different so we could compare. I had the Chicken and was impressed by juiciness and the mushroom chutney it was served with. The Salmon looked delectable and received high praise as well as the Petite Filet Mignon. All the entrees came with fresh Sauteed Green Beans and Fleming's Potatoes (think of the best scallops you've ever eaten, now times that greatness by 10 and you'll have Fleming's Potatoes).  The seminar concluded with a Cheesecake that was sent straight from the Cheesecake gods (it was a huge piece and I was already full but I somehow made room for it!). The Cheesecake was rich, creamy and lightly topped with blueberries (I can't believe I had to go back to work after that feast!). This was my first time at Fleming's I will be sure to come back during normal operating hours so I can try even more of the amazing menu. Bravo Chef and Staff!",

When I complained to, I presumed the Manager, she kindly brought an additional half order to our table and they looked identical to my original order.  It's as though they scraped the bottom of the pot for these sad little legs.  The presentation was horrible.   My husbands rib eye for the first time was not cooked properly and the quality of the beef had so much gristle and way too much marbling there was little left that was palatable.  What's up here!!

    "text": "Was there on Dec. 3.  They got the \"rare\" correct on the filet mignon but it was so horribly salty that I had to drink water throughout and guzzle 3 glasses after the meal.  My mouth was still so salty I needed more food just to get rid of the salty taste from the steak.  The veggies were very good and so were the mashed potatoes.  The dessert was excellent. When the lady (other couple we were with) remarked on how horribly salty her filet mignon was and how bloated she felt afterwards, I knew they didn't just screw up mine.  The chef is a salt freak.  It was a shame that someone knows how to cook steak to order (rare) but he destroyed it with so much salt.  I don't like to make a scene in front of other people and that is why I didn't send it back.  The servers were pleasant and the decor was very nice.",

    "text": "Came here on my birthday and was not impressed. The atmosphere was nice but my husband and I were not happy with the food at all. The bread they gave pre-meal was just ok but didn't seem very fresh. There were two types of butter that came along with the bread and both were actually pretty good. I ordered the lobster bisque to start and honestly, the flavor was a bit odd. I personally think the lobster bisque at Red Lobster is better not to mention cheaper. For dinner, I ordered the seared scallops that came on top of puff pastry and a measly portion of vegetables. The scallops were gritty and seemed like they had not been cleaned properly as I could taste granules of sand. My husband ordered the ribeye since Flemings is supposed to be known for their steak. He said that the steak was not seasoned at all. For sides, we ordered the Flemings potatoes which were really good and the baked potato which was fine, but honestly, how hard is it to mess up baked potato? When the check was presented they also gave me a box of chocolate truffles since it was my birthday. I wont lie, these were amazing!!! Unfortunately, the truffles, Flemings potatoes, and butter will not make me come back. I am all about giving places several tries before deciding to go back but not a place with a huge price tag such as Flemings. When I spend $100 on a dinner for two, I expect everything to be sensational and Flemings was very far from it.  PS: The husband said it was the worst steak ever and you would be better to light your money on fire rather then spending it here. :)",

I wasn't sure the first time we went if we should dress up or if it was okay to wear jeans and a nice top but everyone was either in their business casual work clothes or jeans. I would recommend getting there a little early because it fills up quickly! We got there at 6pm and by 7pm it was pretty full.  I have recommended this to so many of my co-workers and friends to try out and so far anyone that has gone has come back to me saying what a great time they had and how surprised they were with the 5 for 6 'til 7 deal :)",

    "text": "I have to say that I fought going here tonight for dinner. I mean, I am in Arizona and there are Fleming's restaurants in California, so like any good yelper of course I'm going to want to experience the best and most unique restaurants that Arizona has to offer. However, this just so happens to be my brother's favorite restaurant so he won because this was our family's last supper, of sorts, before we leave him by his lonesome in Phoenix. Well off to Fleming's we went and it was fabulous. For a chain restaurant Fleming's does it right; nice decor, impeccable food, excellent service and over 100 different types of wine. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list and checked up on us at all the appropriate moments. The additional support wait staff was very attentive so much so that when (like the klutz that I am) spilled the last sip of wine all over myself, he quickly took my sweater to the bathroom where he blotted it with ice water and handed it back to me in a Fleming's handle bag and recommended that I take it to the dry cleaners and ask that they treat it with the spray that removes wine stains. What a sweetheart! We ordered the sweet chili calamari to start along with a bowl of roasted corn chowder soup with lobster, shrimp and potatoes. I ordered the petite fillet mignon cooked medium rare, my bro had the 20 oz steak and my mom had the Mahi Mahi. All of it was amazing. We finished it off with creme brule and our bill was about 2 bills. Overall it was a great experience and I'm glad my brother won this round.",

At the end, the waitress brought over a box of chocolates and a giftcard to come back for $25 off.  It was truly a good experience.  The food was delicious - expensive but very nice for a special occasion. The steak was absolutely delicious - melts in your mouth. He had the ribeye and he said it was the best steak he has ever had.  I had the chef's featured  entree - 2 four ouce bacon wrapped filets, 2 scallops, and 2 shrimps.  I asked for all shrimps and this was no problem at all!! Mine came with some asparagus as well.  Both entrees came out perfect - from the cook temperature to the specific personalizations to each dish!  The complimentary bread and calamari appetizer  we started with was sooooOOO yummy and the portion size was great! The sides left a little to be desired - we tried the Fleming's potatoes and the macarroni and cheese - both were only okay and did not stand out.  I would invest some money and time into revamping those sides - they did not compliment or stand out like the steaks did!! Similarly...the desserts were only okay for us. We had the donuts and the cheesecake. Overall, a great experience. I would definitely come back - especially on a special occasion - this place knows how to make that person feel good and recongized! I would pass on the desserts and would consider trying other side dishes or passing on them altogether. $10-$13 per side dish is too expensive to be mediocre.",

My first visit I tried the tenderloin carpaccio and the seared ahi tuna. Both were tasty, but I should have only ordered one; I was too full afterwards. I also had a nice glass of merlot that first visit. (I'd give the first visit 3 stars.) This latest visit was not as good; the service wasn't friendly. I sat @ the bar with a buddy, and we both ordered the prime burger. The burger was good, but regardless of how busy the bartenders were, they just weren't friendly (male or female). Shouldn't a place like this offer friendly, quality service? I'm a patient guy, and understand when a place is busy but that doesn't mean quality has to be lacking. I'll go back for the food, but am hoping the service gets better and friendlier.",

Took out my in-laws, wife, & son for their Birthdays, which are all pretty close together.  Everyone of us was really happy with our meals.  The adults all had the 8oz. Filet Mignon & Lobster Tail special, which was great.  Everyone's steak was cooked to perfection, we all enjoyed our salads, the Fleming's Potatos, & each of us had a different dessert (delicious & filling).  Our waiter made an excellent suggestion on a Merlot that I wasn't to sure about.  He brought over a sample of it for me to try. I've now found another wine that I will seek to purchase.  This is the fourth wine that we love, that we had at Fleming's first.  Also, my son had a great steak with his kid's meal that he really enjoyed.  Thanks again, Fleming's for a most memorable evening!",

The tomatoes and pork belly (rather than thin bacon) were amazing.   My favorites dishes: prime rib, filet mignon, ahi tuna (small plate typically) and various specials.  Appetizers/happy hour: tenderloin carpaccio and calamari. The prime burger is awesome.  Salads: wedge and Flemings.  Sides: mac & cheese, Brussels sprouts, spinach, Fleming potatoes and asparagus.  Desserts: creme brulee, carrot cake and chocolate lava cake.  Cocktails: blueberry lemon drop, peach whiskey martini, blackberry bramble and farmers daughter. Also, ward b or 8, but I didn't notice it this visit.  Looking forward to another visit soon.",

    "text": "We have dined at this Flemings location numerous times before and had wonderful experiences, however, this time things fell very flat.  Things started off fine with water and a wine list that was provided via Ipad.  My fiance's mother asked the waitress for wine recommendations and she wasn't able to help ( it seemed like she wasn't too familiar with the selection).  Ordering food was fairly quick and easy.  Once we received our steaks, the waitress informed us about the lava cake that takes 20 minutes to cook, and told us she would check back in shortly to see if we were interested.  We didn't see her again for at least 30 minutes.   I know, I know.  When people usually say 30 minutes they are grossly overestimating out of frustration; however, we actually did wait that long.  So long in fact, it began to get awkward at the table.  All the food was consumed and our wine glasses were empty, yet our waitress was nowhere in sight.  When she did finally show, it was too late to order the lava cake.  We instead ordered two plates of creme brulee and two desserts to go, along with a cup of coffee.  The coffee was cold, and it took 10 minutes to get a new hot cup.  Once dessert was finished we again were left waiting around for our waitress; waiting to clear dishes, waiting to receive the check, and again, waiting to pay the check.  In all it took us two hours to have a simple meal, and that was not by choice.    The food was great, per usual, but the service was just downright bad.",

The steak dishes are understandably the stars of the menu, and on Sundays they have a great special for prime rib: for $37 in addition to the prime rib you get salad, side dish, and dessert.  The prime rib itself is very tender, and perfectly cooked with a choice of 3 sauces to dip it in.  Another good deal is the spring special: Filet mignon and lobster tail with salad or soup, and mashed potato or green beans, for $35.  The filet was also very tender, perfectly cooked, and the lobster was full of flavor, and they will cut it off the shell for you if you desire.  The salmon is also good, perfectly seasoned and nicely cooked.  Service was very attentive, and even though I didn't need it, they offer black napkins to place on your lap if you are wearing something dark so that any lint from the white napkins on the table doesn't get on your outfit.",

They make their food with special twists, like champagne and merlot infused butters with their bread. It's unique and fun to try but the bread itself was nothing special, we would've preferred regular butter with good bread. The Caesar salad has fried capers and prosciutto chips on it. Again, it sounds incredible and was good but nothing I'd crave. Creme Brulee - ditto although the Chantilly cream was excellent.    I will say our filet mignons were cooked perfectly and served piping hot. My husband didn't prefer the flavor of the seared edges but I thought it was good (not great).   All in all, I wouldn't mind if someone wanted to meet here but I'd probably prefer The Keg.",

I received a gift card at Christmas while visiting my partner's family in Phoenix.  We decided to check out the restaurant considering we don't have a Flemings in Portland, OR.  The place is part of the Open Table reservation system which worked perfectly.  I made a reservation via Open Table and collected 1000 points for doing so.  Even better!  We arrived a few minutes early and were greeted by a kind hostess who immediately attended to our reservation.  The place was a bit swanky, but not too intimidating.  The lighting in the restaurant was perfect.  It had a lively ambiance and the patrons were middle-age to older and a bit more upscale than say, Outback Steakhouse.  We were seated and assigned a very knowledgeable waiter who introduced himself as well as the menus and wine selections.  We were offered a choice of either white or black linens which took me by surprise.  Of course I chose black from the standard white as I knew that would hide any unseemly messes.  The food arrived well-presented and almost reverently.  Our plates looked AMAZING!  I ordered a filet mignon which was grilled to perfection.  The medallion melted in my mouth!  The garlic mashed was equally delicious and the asparagus was cooked al dente.  We savored each bite and anxiously looked forward to dessert.  We ordered creme brulee and raspberry chocolate lava cake.  One word:  HEAVENLY!  The dessert was a perfect ending to an already amazing meal.  Needless to say, we left Flemings more than satisfied.  The service, food, atmosphere and cost led to a very harmonious experience for all of us.  We will definitely put Flemings on the agenda of places to dine when we're back in Arizona in a few weeks.  Heck, we'll visit on EVERY visit to AZ!   Thank you Flemings for the outstanding hospitality and excellent service experience!",

Since they open at 5, we figured we would be the first people inside. Much to our surprise it was packed with happy hour patrons. It must be a good one, so we will come back another time to try it.  Leave it to us, though, to dine at a steakhouse and both order seafood. I had the lobster tails and they were amazing. My hubby enjoyed his salmon and said it was some of the best he had ever had. We also had asparagus and the Flemings potatoes. Both were great!   Service was impeccable. We will definitely go back for seconds ;)",

I came with my all male Co workers and we had a great time. Drinks were strong, prime rib burger was on point and I definitely plan to come again. I love that the happy hour menu strayed away from the norm, pizza or wings...had a great time but get there early or be prepared to stand around and watch others have a great time",

A little pricey perhaps, especially since the sides are all a-la-carte. Oh, but their mashed potatoes are so delicious it's worth the extra money. And they have some great salads, too!  It's the type of place you really want to order multiple courses because everything they serve is great, not just the steak. And even though the beer options are limited, their wine list is fantastic. They have a huge selection, at many different price points. Pretty cool that they also give you an ipad to look it all over.  Even though this place is a chain, it's worth a visit if you are in the mood for a great steak. It definitely beats out the other options like The Keg and Ruth Chris. Get on their email list and you'll get the advertisements for when they do special stuff like give you a free gift cards when you spend a certain amount on dinner. They also sometimes do seasonal pre-fixe meals. Right now they also have a small plate special that will help keep the bill reasonable. Of course, you can always stick to the $6 sirloin burger in the bar. ;0) Just wait until the weather is good so you can enjoy it on the patio.",

Not people with kids, dressed in sandals and shorts. For two and 1 glass each of wine I spent $250...for meh steak and some mashed potatoes and mushrooms. It was our anniversary and I could have spent the same at a nice restaurant and gotten an even more special experience.",

We arrived early and took a seat at the bar, lucky for us Brandon (bartender) was awesome. He went over some drink options, went over the happy hour menu and the dinner menu.  Then it was time to be seated, our waitress Krista was great, just like Brandon. She went over the menu, made some good recommendations and we were not disappointed, she definitely made you feel welcome. I suggest the mac and cheese (to die for), my wife had the prime rib (which according to her was sooooooooo good) and I had the seasonal fish which was cooked to perfection. So after all that goodness and if you have any room left, get the carrot cake and you will love every bite. Our experience was wonderful, from the moment you walk in, we will definitely be coming back.",

If you live in the SE Valley, save yourself a trip to Scottsdale for a special occasion and come here.",

Took at least 15mins for our waiter to come introduce himself. 2.) Not a fun atmosphere at all. The booths we sat in felt like we were on display and far from comfortable. 3.) Calamari was awesome, enjoyed that very much win for them. 4.) When the food eventually came out I said to myself, \"this is going to amazing!!\" I mean it had to be, the presentation was on point like Ruth's Chris or Mastro's and it smelled great. I was wrong so very wrong. I don't think this restaurant believes in flavor. 1 steak was severely undercooked and 1 steak was over cooked and tough.  5.) The sides-- the mac and cheese was close but no cigar. The twice cut fries looked and smelled good but tasted like sonic fries with zero salt. 6.) Our free dessert lacked luster and the expensive ass food was anything but spectacular. I need to go back to Mastro's and have the butter cake  My advice if you're looking for a really good meal go to Ruth,s Mastro's, or Steak 44 this place is weak.",

The food was amazing and when the manager asked how our experience had been, I was honest about our disappointment on the slow service.  He was world class and apologized immensely.

I decided to take him to Flemmings in Chandler for his birthday because I didn't want to drive to Scottsdale, and I remember the Scottsdale one being really good with excellent service. This place, not so much. Half the restaurant was filled and there were like 3 servers walking around. We waited a good 10 minutes before anyone came to get our drink orders. The house bread is pretty good but the two cheese spreads it comes with are not very good. We asked for regular butter and that never came out. We got the calamari with sweet chili and that was pretty good. The presentation was really sloppy though, sauce all over the side of the plate and just played really sloppy. I got the Alaskan king crab legs and the husband got the bone in 20oz ribeye. The crab legs were smaller and the meat was dry in some parts, soggy in other parts, and just wasn't the quality we were expecting. The prime rib was cooked perfect medium rare but the flavor was just lacking. The spicy Thai green beans were pretty good and the flemmings potatoes were ok but really heavy. No complimentary dessert for husband's birthday but we got a box of truffles and a $25 gift card. Overall ok but will probably go to Steak 44 or Capital Grille before coming back here.",

    "text": "Flemings Flemings Flemings ...   Well, upon arrival, I was shocked at how loud it was on the dining room floor. There are other seating areas, but the main dining is in one particular area. I will say apart from the noise, I enjoyed the lighting and the atmosphere in general; lots of people smiling and enjoying food.   I ordered the Chilean sea bass & ended up sending it back. Here's why: the 'broth' that it comes in is a bit much for me. My fish was swimming in a broth that made the crunchy bits of potato soggy & took away from the overall enjoyment of the fish. The fish itself was cooked perfectly, but it lacked flavor. The chile pesto that was used to dress the plate was FABULOUS ! I'm wondering why they don't ditch the broth and focus on how the fish and the sauce pair together effortlessly..   The second meal I ordered was the filet mignon & lobster tail. The steal was OK. It was dry and over cooked but instead of ordering AGAIN I decided to give it a try... Eh. I should've sent it back! The lobster was the highlight def. it was tender and cooked perfectly.   Suffice it to say, I'd give them another chance and try some other options on their menu. Although, for a steak house to send out a dry over cooked steak requested medium, that's a pretty tough blow.! I think there's a fine line between being a restaurant that can handle volume & being one that produces decadence with every plate served.",

I have to say I'm pretty disappointed in the reaction of a young tattooed couple trying to enjoy a nice evening together and wished we were not to feel so judged as if we were going to \"dine and ditch\" little alone my wine ended up needing to get replaced from a fly getting into it.",

    "text": "Lots of money for not much quality. Yes, the ambiance was nice, but the focus of our trip, the food, was not worth it. I ordered the steak with the king crab. Kudos to the for actually making it lump crab versus shucking your own. However, it was so dry I had to ask for a replacement.  They were quick to get a new fresh order out to me. It was fine, but did have shell mixed in. :(  Another positive was that my steak was cooked to perfection.    We ordered the Chipotle mac n cheese and the peppercorn parm mashed potatoes.  Mac n cheese was flavorful and a great spin on a classic. The mashed potatoes were flavorless. Which made the dinner even worse... I was so excited to have them!   In the end we thought we'd redeem the night by getting dessert to go..  carrot cake and turtle pie. We've yet to eat them, but regretted the order as soon as we got the bill... they were 12 bucks each!!!  So in the end we spent $200+ tip on a meal that was worth maybe $100.   This place has some cool factors -ipads for wine and dessert options and great service, but I wouldn't pay that much more for those qualities.",

We split a 12 ounce filet with the coffee rub, perfectly cooked and delicious. The Fleming potatoes were good, expected more of a kick with jalapenos but still good.

This time was different as it seems Fleming's has made some changes. I will start with a positive. Our waiter Nathan was fantastic! Very sweet and knowledgeable and took good care of us. All the staff was professional and provided good service.  To start with the rest, they have always had an amazing wine list but for some reason they cut WAY back on the number of choices for a glass of wine. There was not one thing on the glass of wine menu that I was interested in. Three of the salads were great, but one had less than acceptable lettuce on the plate. The onion soup was good.  The top it off lump crab was not good at all! It was very disappointing. The steaks were ok, but nothing like they used to be. I had never had a less than perfect steak there before. Overall, an awfully hefty bill for a meal that did not equal up to that:-(((((",

We had reservations, but when we walked in there was one girl at the desk refusing to make eye contact with us or the other couple that was waiting. There were two other girls behind her but they were busy talking about whether or not to post something on facebook (really? we can hear you).  Finally the first girl looks up and says she'll be right with us. Back to staring at her computer screen. More waiting.  Once we were at the table, the server was nice, he just took a very long time to do everything. It was about 15 minutes before anyone came to our table to greet us (which at the price point of Fleming's is ridiculous) and even then it wasn't our server, it was someone else who just dropped off water glasses and said that our server would be there shortly. That was about the pace of everything else. My date and I can usually pass the time very easily but there were points where it was getting so awkward waiting for the server to show up when we could see him aimlessly wandering throughout the restaurant (yes, aimlessly, not actually doing something, I used to work in the industry, I can tell the difference between someone who is legitimately slammed and someone who is just dazed and confused).  Again, two stars because the food was SO good. Not only for dinner that night but there was so much that I had a fabulous lunch the next day as well. But really for the whole experience go to Maestros or Capital Grille.",

Asked us what to drink, we wanted a bottle of red wine and made a wonderful recommendation.  Brought water and delicious sourdough bread and a couple of different butters (very tasty and rich!)  My husband loves salads but Jurgen recommended the clam chowder.  We got both and split them!  The salad was pretty good but the clam chowder was to DIE FOR!!!  Perfectly seasoned.  We both ordered steaks, with rubs, their potatoes and the Brussel sprouts.  All fabulous!  My husband didn't realize that a sauce came ON his steak.  He's not a sauce guy so we mentioned it to Jurgen so the manager came over.  We weren't complaining but the manager asked if my husband wanted another steak, no questions, over sauce!  Amazing.  He said no, but we got dessert for free instead.  Really?  Yes!  What a way to stand behind your product.  The other manager stopped by as well, just to check on us and chat for a minute and to wish me a happy birthday.  The gal that was taking care of us as well was very attentive but not overbearing.  She impressed us also.  Though it was expensive it was so worth it.  Oh, did I mention Jurgen gave us truffles as well?  What a fabulous meal.  We will definitely go back for the next special occasion.",

Which I loved because it made the lobster taste even more delicious. The lava cake is definitely worth it. The peach mule was not peachy at all in fact it was very limey and tasted more like a margarita. Perhaps it was made wrong but I didn't taste the peach whatsoever and for a 18 dollar cocktail I would hope for something that tastes like the description. Also, ambiance was fine but you are very close to everyone else as far as seating and it is VERY dark so seeing your food is actually really difficult. Other than that the food is great and I'll definitely come back. Good for date nights and celebratory dinners for sure but not the best place for young children. You will also spend a lot here so made sure you plan on it. For the 2 of us it was over 200 with 1 cocktail, 2 entrees, 1 side, and 2 desserts.",

Tonight, however was a different story.  We were charged regular prices for most of our bill and when we asked about why, the waiter was dismissive and rude about it, loud enough for neighboring tables to hear.  He did take the bill and come back very quickly, saying that the bill was correct and just dropped it on the table.  I would have expected a manager to stop by and say something, anything, but evidently the managers there do not care if their tables have issues, they just hide in the back.  At no time, did we ever see a manager that night, but for 5 minutes (before we ordered) while she lit some patio heaters, then she disappeared the rest of the night.  I would expect them to do at least one table touch during the meal.  I guess it's not a \"Fleming's thing\".  All in all very disappointed with the service, the confusion regarding the bill, the menu and the way it was handled and we won't be back.",

For us, it came simply down to the ambiance.  Jordan, our server was wonderful despite her having to shout over the noise.  So if you are looking for an intimate dinner for two this isn't it.  However, our food was delicious...steak perfectly done, great halibut and Fleming's salad was quite nice.  A glass of an awesome Moscato left no room for dessert but received a token of congratulations for our special day which was beautifully presented and greatly appreciated.  Yep...the prices are high...figure on $45+ per person.  We thought it warranted the price but the ambiance could use a definite boost to cater to a more perhaps private dining experience rather than having to shout to speak to one another.",

The side salad is small, we used to be able to split it, not anymore. The appetizer they serve as a complimentary appetizer was dull - cracked bread with 3 dips that aren't very flavorful. It was noisy, hard to visit. We sat on the main floor at a 4 top table. The Service was confusing, had one person take our order & then it seemed another Server took over, we hardly saw the person who took our order at our table, but saw her at others surrounding ours  - food was delivered by someone else, which is typical in many restaurants - that was acceptable. There was a birthday celebration and the birthday person was handed a little box with candies, which is nice - but not special, in the past, they would serve the birthday person creme brulee -- When we want a special night out again, it won't be at Flemings. Prices do not justify the atmosphere, food or service.",

Our beverages were out in under two minutes and the waiter was more than willing to offer helpful recommendations about what was best on the menu.  I decided to go with the New York Strip cooked medium rare with garlic mashed potatoes and a Caesar salad.  The steak was impeccable, with every bite melting in my mouth.  The Caesar salad was about as good as a Caesar gets, and the garlic mashed potatoes were exploding with flavor.  For dessert, I decided upon the lava cake, which I did not share.  The lava cake was so amazing that I felt compelled to share information regarding its goodness with everyone at the table!    The atmosphere in this place is relaxing, the food is unbelievable, and the service is fantastic!",

They have an excellent happy hour for the quality of food they serve. I've tried, obviously the burger and also the crab cakes, both which were yummy. The drink specials are great too, they make a great margarita and have an ample wine list. I'll be back!",
