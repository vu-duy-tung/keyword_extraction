Everything we got was amazing!   Garlic Naan Lamb Saab Ginger chicken kabobs Chicken Bhuna Side of briyanis  ...I really don't think you could go wrong here. All of the dishes we had were seriously delicious. The lamb saab was my favorite, though.  And not only was the food great, but the service was on point. The owner came and talked to us for a bit. Apparently he has a successful restaurant in Prescott and decided to open this place up in Scottsdale about 4 months ago. He was so sweet and funny, and he gave really great recommendations and explanations. Best of all, he gave us coupons for our next visit, which will definitely be happening soon!",

    "text": "I need to preface this review by stating that I am not experienced in Indian cuisine, having eaten at one Indian restaurant in my life, as a child in Toronto. So this was something pretty new to me, which is surprising since we consider ourselves foodies and enjoy many foreign tastes. Admittedly, I didn't have any legit reasons for staying away from Indian food,and my wife finally got me to take her out for some.  We tried Taj Mahal because we got a coupon in the mail - goes to show how a little marketing can go a long way. Our other choice would have been Tandoori Times, which we saw featured on \"Check Please\", but the coupon ended up being the deciding factor.  We chose to try the lunch buffet. Our understanding is that when they opened a year ago, they pulled they buffet because it was so slow in the summer, but now it is back.  We showed up at 1pm and were the only guests there, which made me a little nervous. The buffet was tucked away in a side room, with not the greatest presentation. It wasn't very inviting. Those worries were quickly assuaged by the food itself! My biggest gripe ended up being that the plates stacked for the buffet were not all clean - some still had food crusted on it. I had to go through the stack to pick out the cleanest plate. If I was the manager there, I would put a little more focus on \"dressing up\" the buffet, just for the sake of visual appeal, make it more inviting. And always have clean plates lol.  I started with some rice and then sampled every offering in the buffet - there was a variety featuring crispy fried veggie balls, spinach paneer, tikka masala, curry chicken, lamb vindaloo, lentils, tandoori chicken, and a few others.  Plain and garlic Naan were brought to our table, separate from the buffet. All the food was excellent! The meat was tender, and the sauces were delicious. I went back 2 more times to help myself to a few of the items I really enjoyed (which was almost all of them lol). In particular, the lamb vindaloo stood out - it was so savoury and tender. For me the weakest link in the buffet was the tandoor chicken - the chicken legs themselves were not that great, too fatty and mushy. But everything else was really fantastic!  Consider me sold on Indian food, I am ready to try more after eating at Taj Mahal.  The service was also top notch - you can immediately tell this is family run. The owner came to our table to chat, and was very engaging and very proud of his restaurant. I imagine he visits every table and chats with all the guests, that just seemed to be the overall vibe. Other people trickled in as we dined, and some were already on a first-name basis with the staff. Always a good sign! By the time we left, the business had picked up a bit - I guess we showed up during a dead time of 30 mins or so, so in retrospect was not an issue.  I took a peek at the menu before leaving, and it was pretty large, featuring all the meats, fish, shrimp etc cooked in every style possible. My wife confirmed that it was a pretty extensive Indian menu, she couldn't think of anything missing. The owner assured us that any dish can be ordered at any level of spiciness, accommodating all sorts of taste parameters. The buffet was noticeably toned down, which made sense, and to be honest was PERFECT for me - I didn't want anything too spicy or overly pungent. While it didn't challenge me, the buffet more than made up for that by being very homey and comforting.  And that's the big takeaway from Taj Mahal.... I found this Indian food experience to be COMFORTING above all else. It seems more like eating at an Indian grandmother's kitchen, than a fancy restaurant that tries to \"elevate\" common dishes. Seems like they stick to the basics, without getting fancy, and do a fantastic job. For an Old Town Scottsdale establishment, it was not pretentious or arrogant - it was comforting and confident.  While expanding my Indian food experience probably means trying other places, we definitely intend on returning to Taj Mahal to try their full menu after having enjoyed the buffet.",

If you are concerned with the higher prices at Taj Mahal that is because it is well worth the extra two dollars per dish. The saag paneer and lamb boti masala is worth going there just for those 2 dishes.  If you love Indian food you MUST eat here.  Plus, the owner is friendly and hilarious.",

Sadly all I can say is, If you enjoy eating watered down, lukewarm, miss marked food and dishes which you have to dig to find a piece of meat or Chicken Tandoori which is as dry and charred as 10-year-old jerky!  Then this is the place for you!   Just make sure to clear your appointment schedule for the remainder of the day so you can spend time praying to the porcelain god because there's not enough Charmin toilet paper in the world for you after this experience!   This new sub- par restaurant is new to the Valley and I am quite sure NOT going to be around after what we tasted today!  I am also contacting the Scottsdale Health Department in hopes they will save our community and expose this place on Dirty Dining!",

The dishes, Tandoori Chicken, Lamb Saag, and two veggie Saag Mattar Bhartha / Sage Paneer were all delicious.  Regular Naan was served - nothing special, yet perfect for dipping.  The service was great and when we asked to meet the owner he was extremely charismatic and informative.  He shared the Indian ice cream for dessert, also delicious and a terrific palette cleanser.  The only foreseeable issue with this place is you don't realize how full you are getting sharing yummy small plates and we felt like we needed to walk a few miles before going home to bed!",

It is definitely very pricey ( expensive ) compared to other Indian restaurants. The chicken tikka masala was ok and the Nan bread was very good. However, the chicken curry was terrible that I felt it was not fresh and was smothered with accessive and confusing spices. The Shrimp Buriany was terrible that the rice was very dry and the shrimp was tasteless (not fresh) nor delicious.   As far as service, it was good and the manager was awesome and respectful to me and to my wife.   This is my personal and honest review and I hope it was helpful for you. And if the owner of the restaurant is reading this review, I hope it will help him better the quality of the food and service.  Thank you for reading my review.",

It felt like everything was cooked in heavy cream with no spice and no salt. The gulab jamun was spoilt... if we didn't carry out, I would have returned my entire order.

I've been to most indian restaurants in the greater Phoenix area and Taj Mahal takes the cake. I have not been to the same indian spot here twice, because I have not found one that to me was worth visiting again, but I will definitely be back to Taj. The owner and his wife were friendly as well.",

The meats were cooked to perfection and the naan was great to soak up the sauce. Only drawback was it was a little pricey for the amount of food per dish, but the flavor made up for it. Definitely would go/order again",

We had plain naan, veggie samosas, raita, panir masala and veggie kofta.  The service was good, and the owner and staff were all very nice.  It was great to find such a nice place in downtown!",

It's got a natural ambience with wood, brick, and high ceilings and Gil (the owner) made us feel like we landed in the right place as soon as we walked in. He treated EVERYONE like honor guests! We ordered the lentil soup (loved it) and the Fish Vindaloo, extra hot, WoW lots of flavors and spices happily mixing in the vindaloo, paired with naan and a slightly sweet wine, it was a beautiful lunch.  Some reviews say it's a bit pricey but no, it's competitive and very good quality.  We left the restaurant late at 3:00 pm - 1/2 hour past the lunch closing, but the staff didn't rush or shoo us away. They very sweetly waited until we finished talking with our new friends at the table next to us.  How very cool of them :)",

    "text": "Would give it negative stars if that is even a thing. Went there on Christmas...given it was one of the few places open.  Short story: Worst chicken biryani ever, rude and crass customer service, charged us more than what the bill was.  Long story: The server who sat us down was a soft spoken person. So far so good. Then comes in a loud, over the top, trying to be cool Indian dude to take our order. Says with attitude that they don't have fish pakora....fakes writing down our menu and then makes us repeat it three times. We let it go but by this time, the arrogance of this person is clearly visible. Since we had a toddler with us, we order pulao for the toddler. Mr. Arrogance then asks us the spice level (since we have a toddler with us, we explicitly say mild for the pulao)...to which he arrogantly says he meant about all the other dishes we ordered. (His tone sounded like we have never eaten at restaurants and apparently don't know how to order food off a menu). Anyway, it takes a long time for our main course to be served. The biryani is a mushy mix of rice and chicken curry. Small portions of food for the price. Worst was the behavior of the host...he made snide rude remarks to one of our friends, taunted our friends's wife about what a pity it is that she was married to our friend, repeatedly kept asking the same question about where we are from, made arrogant comments about how we were kicked out of California and hence landed in Scottsdale, made an attempt at hugging the toddler without anybody's permission. There is a whole lot more nonsense and misbehavior that im not even writing down (yelp already says it's a long review). At the end of the whole drama, when we voiced our displeasure, his last snide comment was \"thank god I fed you\". We also witnessed him misbehaving with the server who first sat us down. Dude, if you are the owner who did this: no words for you. If you are the owner and that guy was one of your staff: it would be shameful if you still have him on payroll.",

It's a newer place in old town Scottsdale, so they are still working on some kinks, at times it did seem as if service was slow, but so extremely friendly. We were a big group of 20, so it's somewhat expected.  I knew what I wanted before I even got there, I had been craving chicken tikka masala, just had to have it! So I ordered the chicken tikka masala and some onion naan bread.  The naan bread was packed with sauteed diced onions, it was crispy and soft at the same time and had great flavor!   The chicken tikka masala, oohh my sweet heaven, this was some of the best chicken tikka masala I have had in years! I ordered it at medium heat level and it was good, next time I will go a tad bit hotter.  The chicken was so tender and juicy, and the sauce, oh sweet Jesus the sauce was just heavenly! I really wanted to lick my bowl clean, however I did not haha. The portions look small, but honestly it's the perfect amount, I was full and content with having eaten one of the best meals I have had in a long time.  Looking forward to coming back and trying some other dishes!",

Easy parking in the public garage nearby. Bathroom was nice, I was surprised. They have a separate room for a bigger party which was cool.  I didn't order a drink but my water was refilled several times as needed which was nice. The table ordered a variety of dishes and most came in these silver bowls that were deceptive; they looked like they didn't fit much food but they sure packed it in there. I got the vegetable biryani, has never let me down yet and today was no exception. I ordered it hot but it had no heat so I got hot sauce on the side and BOY that was spicy. I took home my leftovers and I know it'll taste just as good as it does fresh. It had mushrooms in it which was pleasant. I also ordered a papadum appetizer and they tasted as they usually do except these were extra oily, not so great.   Overall yum food with great service and the couple who owns the place were friendly and energetic, especially Gill the jokester. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options to satisfy all.",

The daal was ok, there are to many big pieces of onion and green peppers in there. The daal wasn't so cooked I was eating some of the daal that wasn't boiled perfectly. The paneer is just like so much cream and not a lot of flavor. It needs more flavor and spice. I would maybe try it again but for now I'm going to have to explore other place. The garlic naan wasn't that cooked either, and they were undercooked pieces in there without garlic on there.  The onions and the chilies were not fresh. The onions were defiantly really old also like the chilies. I don't know if I would go back unless the  food changes. It is a pricy place to eat also, 15 dollars an entree that is kinda on the high side.",

The Chicken Tikka came lukewarm and may have been grilled a day or so ago.  The butter chicken was awful and the naan was cold and dry.  Perhaps my expectations are high given years of Indian food experience.  I do not recommend it and I would never come back.  The manager is only interested in chatting up customers especially if speaks Hindi.  Service is slow and hard to engage in a meaningful way.  Draft beer was rough / may need to run line a few times.

    "text": "I don't give out five star ratings, but giving a four doesn't mean the best  Got here late, around 845 on a weeknight. Still a few people at the bar and a few tables being served, so I went ahead and looked at all of the pictures from the reviews and decided that I would just simply get a regular chicken tikka. Not very adventurous, but look, I've done my fair share of obscure and 'weird' Indian food in the past, so I have no problem keeping it mainstream sometimes. Also, at every type of cuisine restaurant, there are a few main dishes that you can use to gauge the quality of food there. For Italian, you try a place's lasagna and chicken parm to find out if they know what they're doing or if they're pulling your leg. At an Indian joint, you go for the chicken tikka. If you got a winner there, you consider coming back for more. So that's what I did and do.  I ordered it medium spicy, and I was very pleased with the results. The chicken was nice and tender and spiciness level of the sauce was not too spicy for my palate. They gave me complimentary rice which was actually delicious. Not too sticky, not too buttery. By the way, have you heard the one about the butter? If not, I'm sorry, but I can't tell you (it might spread).  I literally ate everything on the rice and the chicken. I laid the rice out on my plate and poured my chicken onto it. Good move on my part. I also ordered the garlic flavored na'an bread and you know what? That was delicious as well. An Indian joint that touts their home-baked na'an and doesn't pull through with quality bread is a big no-no. But this place definitely pulled-through with the bread.   Now, like I said, I've been to many Indian places in my life. There are a few really good ones around my home, but this place is a little bit more on the expensive side, and the reason for that is because we are paying their rent. This is a nice, upscale restaurant, with nice interior decoration. I don't know if they did their decoration themselves or whether they bought an existing restaurant that failed and converted it over (more likely the situation given the non-Indian motif), but nonetheless it is a nicely decorated restaurant in an expensive part of Old Town Scottsdale, and so of course they're going to pass their rent on to us. Not a problem if you don't mind paying a few extra bucks and keeping things local.  It seems to be a family-run operation, and though I was not pleased to see children working there late at night, I understand that this is part of their culture. I guess I feel that although the food was on the expensive side, that the the quality and the taste and flavor as well as the service were all there, and I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant to try different items on their menu in the future.",

The owner at this place is a little overbearing -- when we told him what we'd like to order, he simply kept saying we should get the Paneer Masala instead (despite us mentioning that we didn't want that item on the menu). My friend who'd joined me for dinner gave up and ordered the Paneer so he's stop trying to convince us.   After ordering our entrees, we were made for wait for about 45 minutes although the waiter and the owner were being apologetic about that during our wait and when our food finally arrived they got in the WRONG items -- Chicken Tikka Masala instead of the Paneer he was ever so enthusiastic about making us order. My friend who's vegetarian totally lost her appetite  although they brought in our right orders later. Needless to say, I won't be coming back here.",

The tables and dinnerware are clean and the chairs are comfortable. The host seated us quickly with no wait time, allowing us to select our own table. There were several other patrons on a Sunday night after seven in the evening. The food is delicious. The menu is has many selections which include chicken, shrimp, fish,  and vegetarian, and I believe vegan dishes, all reasonably priced. I have eaten at a few other Indian restaurants, including one in New York City, and one in Ohio, and another in the Phoenix area, but this one is the best because the food tastes like it is definitely made from scratch, being very fresh, and both appetizers and entrees are generous, delicious portions. My husband ordered a spinach and rice dish, and I ordered chicken curry. All food arrived promptly, very warm and perfectly mildly seasoned as we had ordered it.  We also ordered two appetizers, onion rings with mint sauce and another sauce and boneless chicken, as well as a bowl of tasty, long-grain rice, and  beer and Pelegrino for our beverages. The appetizers were prepared in a light batter of chickpea flour, fried in soy oil. We had generous portions of everything, enough to bring some home for a midnight snack. We were too satisfied to eat dessert, but hope to try those too on our next visit. The service was prompt and friendly. The owner took the time to come over to our table and introduce himself and to make sure that we were happy with the service and the food. We had a friendly conversation with him. This restaurant is one that I would recommend to anyone who wants authentic Indian cuisine with a variety of cuisine. We look forward to eating at the Taj Mahal again very soon!",

There was no tomato and almost had a buttery quality. Different, but we really liked it. Since it's fairly slow after just opening, the owner (Gil) had time to chat with us. He was really friendly and gave us an order of the carrot pudding to try. Something we'd never have ordered, but it was rich and delicious. Definitely recommend this place!",

It's probably the best Indian I've ever had (and that includes from London, where the Indian food is fantastic).  We had the Chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, Cheese Naan, Saag Paneer, and Dahl.  I'd highly recommend all of them.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is creamy without being too buttery, and the flavors are strong without being overwhelming.  The Saag was cooked to perfection - it was thick and flavorful - not runny and soggy like some Saags I've had.  The Dahl was spiced perfectly - sometimes the lentils can be overpowering but Taj seasoned them just right so that they didn't take over the dish.  Can't wait to come back and try more!",

As an example, if you like Indian vegetarian food, which by the way is the norm in India, get out of your Scottsdale comfort zone and try 'Little India' on baseline and McClintock. Like your mom would cook at a fraction of the price. Overall, this place is not worth the money.",

Then a gentleman came over to find out if the food was to our liking and had the right amount of spice.  They were very accommodating. He told us that if we wanted more Nan or rice we just had to ask the waiter who stayed to help us.  The food was absolutely the best I've had here in the valley.

It is a typical meal and since our favorite Indian place was closed, we decided to try Taj Mahal based on the yelp reviews. I was pretty disappointed and felt kinda ripped off.  First for the price ($50) you get 1 Chinese take out box of rice, 2 small plastic containers of butter chicken (more butter sauce than chicken womp, womp) and 2 pieces of garlic naan. The naan is pre cut for you into triangles. We got 4 triangles per person...so...hmm....2 pieces of naan cut into fourths? Was that really 2 separate orders? Stop cutting the naan please.  The naan had no garlic and not cilantro...was just plain. We live pretty far from this place so we just ate what we had.   The flavor was good. Spice was good. Chicken was a little dry and chewy.   I wouldn't have minded the price if the portion had been right. Just feels like you pay for the atmosphere and to be in Scottsdale. The staff is very sweet. Very attentive.   All in all, meh.",

Hope that the community is able to branch out and give Indian cuisine a try! The Scottsdale location is spacious, clean, and comfortable. There's a nice vibe to it. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the flashing bar lights - a little too distracting for me.   My SO and I have been to this location a handful of times and have really enjoyed each time. Food is always satisfying and service is always accommodating. There are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options - not uncommon in this cuisine, but always great to note for first timers. This past time, we started with the vegetable samosa. Yummy as always! For the main courses, we had the saag paneer, pakora masala, and the aloo chole. We had a friend with us that never had Indian before and she wholeheartedly thought that everything was delicious.  We used a Groupon this night - definitely a great deal!Just know that the fine print indicates one Groupon per table only.",

Five of us visited this place in Old Town on a quiet night and at the end, the owner had quietly threw on a 20% tip to the bill.  It was added to the list of charges as if it was another dish.  That automatic gratuity is not mentioned on the menu and totally unnecessary for a group of only 5.  It's a good thing we noticed it, because when we used our credit card the receipt contained another line to add a tip (typical of any restaurant), which set us up to potentially pay even more.  We confronted the owner about this hidden charge and he was unapologetic, did not offer to remove it, and made no commitment to stop taking advantage of other guests.  Loud, disruptive behavior and deceitful practices deserve a negative review.",

It took an unusually long amount of time to receive our food. But this is not what bothered me. We finished eating and asked for boxes for our food, and we were given the check. I visibly placed my card into the check and stood it at the end of the table. The waitress disappeared for 10 minutes and the entire time the manager was having a chit chat with the table next to us, all while we were waiting for my card to be ran. This went on for 20 minutes and finally after the manger finished her conversation she grabs the check off our table and runs my card while setting it on our table and walks away.

We went in on Friday night around 6:30 and found the restaurant wasn't busy yet. They offered us a seat wherever we wanted so our group of 3 found a table to our liking.  After looking over the menu, we got the Paneer Masala, Saag Mattar Bharta, & Chicken Tikka Masala along with a garlic naan & plain naan. Everything came out smelling so good, and after only the first bite, we were so impressed with the food.  The Chicken Tikka Masala had a delicious, creamy curry and the chicken was tender & perfectly cooked. I had gotten it with mild spice, which was actually perfect for me! We got the Paneer Masala with medium spice. The dish was very similar to the chicken, equally delicious, only with a little bit more spice. My fiance decided to get the Saag Mattar Bharta super spicy and it was definitely that! For my mom & me, it was too spicy, but he enjoyed it. The entrees came with a side of rice, but the naan was so warm and fluffy, I'd recommend getting that! I always like getting garlic naan but their plain naan was also good.  Our waitress was available when we needed something, she came by to refill our drinks, and the owner even came by to check in on us. The menu items seemed a bit more expensive than they are at other Indian restaurants, however the taste was worth the cost! I hear they offer a lunch buffet now ... can't wait to return soon!",

    "text": "As somebody who was born and raised in the sub-continent I am intimately familiar with Indian and Pakistani cuisine.  I dined here with my family to celebrate the second anniversary of my wife's passing away. She was a superb cook who excelled in preparing Indian and Pakistani food. She and I often frequented restaurants that served this type of cuisine, all over the United States: New York, Chicago, San Francisco, LA, etc etc.  One of our pet peeves was that the vast majority of Indian restaurants appear to prepare one curry that is used for different kinds of dishes. That means that whether you order chicken curry, lamb curry or beef curry they all taste the same. Also the curries are chock full of cream.  But let's cut to the chase. Taj Mahal is an Indian restaurant, but it does not suffer from this dilemma. Each of the 5-6 dishes we ordered were unique in their taste. And yes the dishes were quite good.  The owner was present when we dined and he personally attended to us. That's impressive.  However, I must say that the prices are egregiously high. Perhaps it's so because of the high rent district the restaurant is located in. But price conscious customers like me may find it hard to afford this place.  I prefer a Pakistani restaurant, Hilal Grill, in Phoenix. The food at Hilal Grill is as good, if not better, than at Taj Mahal. And it's much more affordable. Yes it's not in downtown Scottsdale but who cares.  Aficionados of good food will go to great lengths to relish good offerings.  So, if money is not an issue, Taj Mahal May be your choice. But for the same or better quality I'd rather go to other options.",

The restaurant is all hand crafted flamed wood and industrial look bar with some modern flare and India influence. Very impressive for a table for two or a large party . I asked if they cater large parties since the decor of the restaurant is so beautiful. They do. The menu was traditional Indian cuisine a large menu. I ordered the appetizer sampler , saag panneer , and panneer masala. You can taste the difference of the freshness amazing full spice delicious. I'm so impressed that I've found by far the best authentic Indian restaurant in Scottsdale , Arizona . Wow !",

Just let that sink in. When I moved to the Valley a few years ago, I tried to find delicious Indian food near my house. I have probably tried over 10 different restaurants. Nothing cures my craving for Chicken Tikka Marsala like Taj Mahal.  I am so glad that they opened up a location in Old Town. The Valley needed a healthy dose of delicious Indian food.",

    "text": "We should have known better to patronize a restaurant that has no one in it during dinner time on Saturday night in the heart of Old Scottsdale.  We were the only ones in the place, when another party arrived and were seated right next to us in this huge establishment.  The ambience was that of a night club, with strobing cord lighting under the bar, which was annoying.  The only piece of decor that alluded to being in some sort Indian restaurant was the stencil design on the brick wall.  Everything else screamed leftovers of some sort of defunct restaurant.  With only two tables in the restaurant, both orders for each party were completely messed up.  Not sure how this could happen....it's not like the place was busy!    The whole experience was very odd, especially for a restauranteur with experience (they have a restaurant in Prescott).  First was the question about the garlic naan, and if it was too greasy after we started eating it.  Then the shenanigans with the wrong orders.  As soon as the food was placed on our table and we served ourselves, the man who may have been the owner walked over and said \"yes, that's not the chicken\" and went back to the kitchen.  Huh?  So what are we eating?  What took it over the level of \"gross\" was when one of the male wait staff came over to ask if he could taste one of the main courses we had on our table....then immediately grabbed the large spoon and dripped some of the sauce in the center of his hand and LICKED IT! \"Yes, that's the Coconut Lamb!\" All right in front of us!  My husband and I looked at each other and thought is this really happening?  Horribly disgusting! We didn't order the Coconut Lamb, the other table did.    On a side note, the Basmati rice was greasy, dull and had lots of clumps, which if made fresh should be light, fluffy but slightly firm and aromatic.  This had the consistency of generic Minute Rice.    The quality of the meat, lamb and chicken, was mediocre.  The tastiness and spice complexity to the dishes was very bland.  While not a major connoisseurs of Indian cuisine, both my husband and I felt this place was no contestant in comparison to other establishments we've enjoyed on the west coast.  Even if the dinner was uneventful, $51 is steep for the portions and quality.  While we did take what we didn't eat home, we did toss it after questioning the restaurant's hygiene practices.  We didn't complain and make a spectacle, as this isn't our style, but we will not come back again.",

    "text": "Child labor. I encourage you to look at Sandra's reply. This is obviously a very angry and disturbed woman. You would have to be disturbed to use child labor to begin with. She is clearly trying to save herself and her business. The humiliation of breaking the law and treating their customers poorly must really be getting to her. She was incredibly rude to my wife and my wife was the one who pointed out her unpleasant attitude and demeanor. The only reason they have so many good reviews is because they offer free naan with a yelp review. Not a good experience last night. To begin, the appetizers we ordered were lamb samosas. They were terribly seasoned and way too salty. No too spicy--too salty. Waaayyyyyyy too salty.  Here's the REAL REVIEW: We felt very judged and spoken down to by the corpulant woman walking around the dining room. I hate to be crass, and normally I would not be so crass, but we were treated horribly. There are a hundred more appropriate and refined words I could use, but the white lady, Sandra, (we are also both white) with vitaligo is a b**** (I find this description highly appropriate) (maybe she's the manager, maybe the bartender or just a hostess). I think that's the perfect word to describe her. She slammed her sweaty hands down on the table and informed us that we couldn't combine a Groupon with the yelp check-in offer, which was fine. She seemed to make a much bigger deal out of this than we did or would have. She seemed offended that we even asked. We told her it was totally fine and that we would happily use the Groupon instead of the check in offer. It's not like we're hurting for money. This is scottsdale. We are two young professionals with great careers. It is rare that I leave a bad review (check my profile). However, the way she smugly and angrily delivered this news along with her condescending attitude, speaking to us like were were stupid or cheap, is why I am writing this review. You can see in her response she does accuse me of being cheap (I was going to leave nothing, my wife left her the dollar). She was exceedingly rude to us throughout this unfortunate dining \"experience\". I presume this is because one or a combination of several reasons, perhaps because of how nicely my wife and I were dressed in designer clothing (which is the norm in PV, we had just come from Neiman Marcus), or perhaps because of our sports car parked out front (clearly visible from the entranyway) in relation to our young age or perhaps it was simply because we asked to be seated near the window rather than near the young children sitting at the bar. Regardless, when serving others you should exude politeness as that is your job. We had been nothing but polite as customers from the moment we arrived. She has been giving us awful looks since we got here, especially to my wife. There are loud Indian children sitting AT THE BAR. I'm pretty sure this is illegal and will be posting the pictures of these obviously underage kids playing their videogames at the alcoholic bar. The food was mediocre and not at all authentic. We will not be back even if the food was better--because of this unfortunate and angry woman. Indian paradise is WAY better. We also asked the girl pouring our water how old she was. Guess what she said? \"I'm 11.\" They have 11 year olds working here. That is illegal and we will be reporting them. I'll also be posting pictures. I can tell you this, we will not be leaving north scottsdale to eat. The only reason we even went here was becaise my wife is an avid grouponer and it was close to the mall. EDIT: You don't get rich by throwing money away. You shoukd kever criticize someone for using a promotion that your business is offering no matter how much money you think they do or don't have. Sandra, allow me to loosely quote you \"I knew from the moment you didn't get your naan you were giving us a one star review ....\" and you want to accuse us of discrimination? You may think were were rude, but at least we aren't servers. Go do something with your life other than taking out your own insecurities on others. Even if you want to be a server, be a better server. We will be spreading this on Facebook and to our friends. I find it hilarious and sad that you found the need to send such a lengthy response. You probably voted for Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders and have the gall to talk about hard work in America. I stand by everything I said. This woman is just trying to save her own a**. (to be crass and \"unprofessional\" again.",

But it got weird when the owner (Gil), who appeared visibly intoxicated, to interrupt my lovely evening alone. I appreciate owners to touch base with tables on occasions but he took that too far by pulling up a chair and mingling with (me) and other guests, and that's great, but a little too much. The food, however was excellent. The waiters were helpful, replenishing my drink and checking up on me. However, the waiters seemed on edge as the owner barked orders across the dining room loudly, enough to interrupt every guest in the restaurant, it was apparent he was a dictator of his establishment. Needless to say, it was very uncomfortable and unprofessional. The food is amazing, the service was great! Just disappointed in the manager's approach in running his business. May or may not return to Taj Mahal. I hope what I seen improves. As a former server, current restaurant manager in the industry, my sympathy goes out the employees.",

The quality of the food was amazing and the spices were done just right. I especially liked the lamb which so often disappoints, with onions, peppers and a nice tomato curry.

The entrees all average about $18, but should cost five or six bucks less. The staff and owner are nice, but the food was very average. We both had curry and they put the extra spice in my food rather than than my dining companion's food. Both the dishes are normally made with dark meat, but they gave us chicken breast as requested. One of the chicken pieces in my meal was too fatty to eat and some pieces were luke warm as well. The coconut curry was better than the Vindaloo, but all dishes were just unsatisfying. I don't think Americans can ever have a great Indian meal because it's just not a food we grow up eating.    The best part of the meal was the garlic naan at four bucks.",

I ordered the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan, which are my main orders at any new restaurant to gauge the quality, and I have to say Taj did not disappoint! I came in closer to closing time and the owner Gil, sat with me while I ate and we talked the night away! His wife, Sandy, is an absolute delight and the decor of the restaurant is amazing!  I absolutely recommend this Indian restaurant to anyone who is looking!",

I have had truly excellent Northern Indian (Punjabi style) food in West and East Coast and in the UK and this ain't it.  I thought the Rainta was watery and tasteless, the Lamb Paneer was skimpy with actual lamb, and the Naan bread looked suspiciously \"pre-made\"...perhaps frozen and then baked?  It just did not have the 'off the Tandoor\" burn marks and stretched look one would expect to see for Naan costing around $6.00 per serving.  That said, the waitress was sweet and attentive and the place looks nice.  It's just overpriced for what is an average curry shop.",

Owner is friendly and was walking around talk to everyone and also taking orders.   We ordered a few different items, chicken tikka masala, biriyani, tandoori chicken and naan per his recommendations. Unfortunately the food was not very good. The lassi was made well. The food portions were definitely on the smaller side especially for the price. It was also not spiced very well and did not feel very authentic.  Will likely not return here for Indian food as there are better options in the Valley.",

    "text": "As an appetizer, I got the Vegetarian Platter: Onion Bhaji, Veggie Pakora, & 2 Vegetable Samosas - $12.  I really enjoyed the Onion Bhaji & Veggie Pakora; both were perfectly seasoned and delicious. The Vegetable Samosas were good, but I wasn't a fan of their tamarind sauce, at all. It was way too tart and had no hint of the sweetness that I like in my tamarind sauces.    My main entree was the vegan Aloo Saag -$14, which I ordered spicy/hot.  It was ok, but it was too dry and it had zero spice.  I have had delicious vegan Aloo Saag at other restaurants, so they cannot use the excuse that the lack of cream is the culprit. I have no idea where the spice went, but none of it went into my dish.  I was very disappointed, and it was certainly not worth $14.  I was told that the only vegan bread options were the roti and the Aloo Pratha. I don't like roti so I got the Aloo Pratha -$5.  The bread was hard (too difficult to cut) and not tasty.   My lunchmate had the non-vegan Aloo Saag and some naan. She stated that her naan was also hard and she was not happy with her Aloo Saag either.   I had issues with their cleanliness. When we arrived at the dinner opening time, we were the first ones there.  The benches had not been cleaned or wiped down from the lunch crowd (which was about 3 hours earlier). I had to ask the waiter to wipe the seats. Also, there was some sort of food in my water glass. I had to ask for a new glass. Lastly, I saw a guy get hired immediately after about a 2 minute interview, which was cool. It was not cool to see him immediately start waiting tables and he was holding one tables' water glasses against his shirt! I think the manager said something because the new guy then placed the already tainted glasses on a tray.   The prices were too high for the quality (of food & service) and amount of food that you get. It is unlikely that I will re-visit.",

However, Mark H. was along and ordered one and then was freely sharing it. Yep, I was licking the cup before our food arrived, at least I didn't order it AND I didn't drink the whole lassi!   Garlic naan is a must-have. The bullet naan is a welcome change, but I definitely preferred the garlic.  The lentil dish had quite the spice kick to it, ordered medium. It paired nicely with the naan.  Lamb vindaloo had great flavor and at the medium spice level was a little lower on the spice scale from others that I've had. Tasted great though.  Butter chicken was the surprise for me. Very flavorful. I had seconds on that, or maybe even thirds.   The vegetable korma was the fourth dish. Perfect pairing to the butter chicken.  The staff was excellent, and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. No room for dessert sadly, but I did have that mango lassi!",

Not much of light beer type but glad I got to try once.  Vegetable samosa was very good. I really liked the sauce came with it. I set it aside to eat with rice later as they were that good.  For dinner, we shared three different curry. My favorite was lamb korma. I tend to order lamb korma at every Indian restaurant as I know that's one dish seemed to be always consistent and I know I will enjoy. I don't have much experience with Indian food, so I try something new every time. This time was egg plant vegetable curry. It didn't have that of good flavor for me, they were okay, I probably won't order it again. Fish curry on the other hand was good. Not as good as lamb but curry had nice flavor to it, I wouldn't mind trying it again.  Service was very friendly. It was a slow weekday night. Owner came over to talk to us often and he was really funny. Service was prompt. Nice decor and ambiance, it was a good experience for me.",

I've finally found it at Taj Mahal. The food is awesome. It is seasoned just right and an explosion of flavors for your palate. I've been eating mostly vegetarian and they had numerous vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. I really look forward to returning and trying more dishes. The added bonuses are the atmosphere and the service. The restaurant has a great and cozy decor that is clean and welcoming. Most importantly was the service. Our server Sandra was awesome! She was super friendly and attentive! The owner, Gil, is a great guy as well! He has super positive energy! He visits ever table to make sure you're satisfied and just has an infectious upbeat happy energy that rubs off! I will definitely be returning soon!",

The owner and staff is knowledgeable about the food which is important because we have some dietary restrictions.

We have never had a poor experience with this restaurant and will continue to go to both locations for some great Indian food. Enjoy!",

This is a new establishment so still working through some kinks service and bar wise but the food was outstanding.   Gil, the owner, has another outstanding Indian restaurant in Prescott and decided to start a restaurant here in Scottsdale, so glad he did! I have been to his restaurant in Prescott on two occasions when in town and was very impressed then so was surprised to learn of his newest venture while talking with him at the bar last night. His Prescott restaurant is located on Whiskey Row just southwest of the main town square and is huge.  We started with samosa's which were perfectly cooked and spiced along with flavorful sauces to accompany and also tried the mulligatawny soup which was very hardy and  delicious. Wife had chicken korma, son had curried goat and I tried mahi mahi vindaloo which was cooked perfectly with large chunks of moist fish in a spicy vindaloo sauce. Goat is always one of our favorite meals whenever dining and Taj Mahal did not disappoint with large pieces of tender fall off the bone goat in a flavorful curry. All sauces and spices were spot on inviting us to finish every morsel with the naan bread.  This is also a larger establishment located next to Dos Gringos with a full bar so please do yourself a favor and come down to the 5th Street corridor to try what we thought was definitely the best Indian food in the Valley. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Horrible experience. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and got a chicken dish that looked yellow, more like a malai kofta than a tikka masala sauce. I ordered medium/hot and there was so little spice in it that it tasted like nothing. I then had to go up to the bar to tell the waiter we didn't get our naan after waiting for 5+ minutes after the rest of the food came. I also told the waiter the chicken tasted very very mild and she took it back to add more spices and came back to say the chef would just remake it. Okay fine by me. While I was waiting for the remade chicken the naan came out and it was raw! Had to send that back as well and it came out raw around the edges a second time. She said they have a new naan chef, but you think they would make sure he isn't making raw naan before putting him in the kitchen to make customer's food. The remade chicken was slightly more spicy but still in no way a medium/hot or even remotely looking like the RED chicken tikka masala sauce it was supposed to be.   After that whole ordeal I got the bill and I was charged for everything. I had to use a yelp coupon to get the naan taken off the bill. I have never had so many problems with my meal and not even been comped for the chai tea. My wife is Indian and I have eaten at plenty of great Indian restaurants and this is one of the worst experiences I have had at any Indian restaurant anywhere. The staff was friendly sure, but the food was horrible. We just moved here from New Jersey, where great Indian restaurants are aplenty. We will not be coming back to the Taj Mahal!",

The owner happened to be there and had a nice chat with us since there wasn't a lot of customers at the time. (Cusses like a sailor but humorous too!) He even gave us free desserts! The only downside of this restaurant is the portion sizes run about $16.99+ for a small bowl with rice. Their naan is also terrific (they have assorted naan too!) Overall, if you want delicious Indian, and don't mind the prices, then by all means! Would definitely come back here again!",

    "text": "One would expect more of a tourist trap kind of place in the Old Town Scottsdale area, but Taj Mahal popped up on Yelp for me as a well rated restaurant for Indian food in the Phoenix area and it did not disappoint. I called up the place as it was after 9 pm and a cheerful gentleman answered the phone and said \"come on in...the kitchen is open until 11,\" whereas other similar options for food had shut down for the evening or were winding down to close. Service by the guy behind the bar (could have been the manager) was attentive and friendly. The onion bhaji was spiced right and prepared well. For mains, we ordered the chicken tikka masala and saag paneer, with naan and rice. Both meals had great and well spiced gravies, and I appreciated the fact that they had several different levels of spice preparation for food. If it's one thing I would fault the business on is charging for rice and not including some complimentary with the main courses, but perhaps I am a bit spoiled by that being a standard back home in NJ. The Yelp check in offer of free dessert was happily honored with the choices of kheer (rice pudding), gulab jamun, or kulfi. All in all, Taj Mahal was a great option in an area unfamiliar to me and I would definitely return and recommend it to others. A bonus is that the restaurant is located in a vibrant and lively area with lots of shops to roam around in pre- or post-dinner.",

At first glance, the restaurant seems nice and you'd expect an above average dining experience (especially considering the price). However, everyone at our table felt pretty \"meh\" about our food.   The curries were alright. They're missing some staples from the menu like malai kofta. We got the eggplant curry and it just wasn't really prepared the way it normally should be. Others at our table got some chicken and lamb curries. Also our server forgot our order like three times. Why not write it down the first time and get it right?   The thing I had an issue with most was the naan. It was brittle and dry, as if it wasn't fresh, and it was almost to the point where it was too burnt to eat. Really not enjoyable. Also overpriced.   Here's the icing on the cake. They included tip in our bills without telling us, even though we were only a party of 4. Parties of 6+ I understand, but party of 4...? C'mon that's just cheating. We didn't realize this and ended up double tipping on the already overpriced meal.   Safe to say I won't be coming back. I'd give it 2 stars normally, but decided on 3 because not everyone's expectations for Indian food may be as high as mine.",

Maybe they are working out some kinks from being new. Hopefully things will get better. I would try them one more time in the hope that this was a one time fluke.

I felt like he was angry one minute and laughing the next, over and over again.

The service staff(one who consisted of a young girl) had problems with simple things like serving everyone water. When my family told them about their bad service. The waitress freaked out and started yelling and then the owner was yelling. It was odd, it was like he was kicking us out but telling us he hoped we had a fun evening. Most of my family go outside and while we're outside we see my cousin get pushed out towards the door. Turns out our waitress decided to push him because she was upset about us complaining about her service. After that the restaurant tries to charge us on top off the discount they gave us. So my uncle's called the police...yeah suffice to say we won't be going to this restaurant again.",

We were very sad to leave our constant go-to for Indian there (it's called Gandhi Mahal if you ever venture up to Minneapolis), and our expectations were very high moving down here. After trying a few places around the Tempe/Scottsdale/Paradise Valley and feeling pretty disappointed, I think we've finally found our go-to here at Taj Mahal.  We ordered take-out and got the chicken tikka masala, lamb boti masala, and a large rice. I was pretty surprised that the rice was extra, but figured the entrees wouldn't let us down, and they sure didn't. Both dishes were deliciously rich and creamy without being heavy. The flavor was incredible! The portions aren't huge, but we had plenty leftover for lunch the next day which was still outstandingly delicious.  While waiting for my order to be ready, I chatted with the owner who has a big personality and clearly knows how to treat customers right. He kindly threw in a complimentary naan bread and hot sauce on the side just for waiting a few extra minutes.  I do wish I could give 4.5 stars only because the naan was a little dry (maybe from it being take-out?) and the lamb was a little tough, but the flavor and customer service experience were both outstanding. We will definitely be back soon!",

We were regular patrons for almost a year, until our hectic schedules took over and we eventually needed to revamp our eating habits to suit our lifestyle. The food is tasty, well-prepared and well-presented. You can't go wrong with any of the chicken dishes (we've tried them all!) The lassis are delicious and Gil, the owner, makes sure he sits down to chat with and check on every patron even on busy nights. He owns a sister location in Prescott.  The staff is absolutely on point on this place. Decor and ambiance is really nice, and we loved the added authenticity of viewing Bollywood music videos playing on the flat screens during dinner.   It's a great place to pop into after a long day of shopping up and down 5th Ave. as well as a great place to have a romantic date, a business lunch, or a drinks/appetizers meet-up spot with friends.   Gil takes care of his customers overall, but if you are a regular and there's mutual respect, you can expect a free drink or dessert on different occasions. Some may find Gil \"rude\" but we can assure you he's not. He's just a busy man with 2 restaurants he mostly runs himself and can appear to be in a rush. On slower days he will take the time to sit at your table to chat for 5-10 minutes. This may sound off-putting to some, but we actually really appreciated this gesture. He will memorize your favorite drinks/dishes and ask you if you'd like those very things the next time he sees you...even if months have gone by!",

Ordered the Gobi Manchurian, The Vegetable platter, Roti, Naan, Veg Biryani, Raita, Dal Makhni, Paneer masala and the Saag bharta.  The appetizers were great and adequately spiced. They messed our Rotis up and put butter on them when we ordered with no butter. Due to this we had to wait for like 15mins before we could start eating the entrees and everything went cold. The folks were apologetic for this mess up and gave us some free rotis and a mango lassi. Not much they could have done I guess.  The food was delectable and presented well. The quantity could have been more considering the price.  Definitely recommend!!",

The servers were extremely friendly which is the only reason this has more than 1 star, but the tandoori chicken was undercooked on some pieces and clearly burnt on others.

At a quick glance I saw a 4 and a 1/2 star rating and 400+ reviews! Wow!! I immediately told my coworkers this is the place we're going to. I love Indian food and 4 and above stars is great!  Being that it's summer we notice that alot of places were empty but we were told that during the summer this is how it is here. It wasn't a reflection of the business itself so quickly glancing at the menu I knew I wanted the chicken massala. I was so pleased with my choice. I tried the garlic naan and rice which is enough to share.  So let me tell you how good this place is. I came back the next day with my coworker. This time, I tried the butter chicken as recommended by Gil, the owner. He's very friendly and his passion for this place is evident.   I didn't end up loving the butter chicken as much as I did the chicken massala, but it was still very tasty and probably some of the best Indian food I've had in a long time.  I highly recommend this place if you're visiting the Scottsdale/Old Towne area.   I can't say I'm in a huge rush to come back to Scottsdale or Arizona, but if I'm ever in this area again I definitely coming to the Taj Mahal.",

The naan was not to heavy and the rice was cooked to perfection now let's talk the chicken tikka masala we order the mild to medium it had excellent flavor and perfect for someone who does not handle spice well...  oh yes the service was excellent. let's say you will find me as regular.......I haven't even paid my bill  and I am already to come back!",

    "text": "Maybe my expectations for Indian food are too high, but this place didn't leave me craving to come back to this place. The decor in the inside is pretty nice, and it is in a good location in Old Town, but the food and service itself was subpar.  We ordered the naan and an eggplant curry. The eggplant curry was alright, a little closer to what it should taste like but not quite the authentic feel. It did have a nice kick to it from the spice, but had a bit of a raw eggplant taste to it. The naan looked good but tasted bad, as it almost felt like I was eating wafers or something instead of naan. Naan is supposed to be soft and fluffy while being somewhat thin, but this naan is more on the crispy side and way too thin. And on top of that it is so expensive for what you get...  I come from eating Indian food in California and the East Coast, so maybe Indian food here has lower standards. But I am rating this place based on how it tastes, and this is honestly how I feel about this place.",

We ordered all vegan dishes:  Mattar Bhartha Chana Masala Punjabi Dhal  The bhartha was the favorite, which was no surprise to me because I love eggplant dishes. I wish it had been a little more spicy, but the flavors were bright and delicious.   We also ordered rosemary naan and basmati rice, and my friends enjoyed a chai tea and a glass of wine.   The flavors of all of the dishes blended so well together, and I thoroughly enjoyed my leftovers the next day!  I'm glad to know Taj Majal is close by and I'd come back for dine in or takeout :)",

Compared to Indian restaurants in the Midwest and on the East coast, this lamb was very high quality and very tender.  Seasoning was delicious, on par with several other authentic Indian locales I've visited and thoroughly enjoyed.  They do have a full bar which I took advantage of.  Happy to report that the mixed drinks are not watered down.  At $12 per, my two drinks cost more than the food, but... alcohol is optional.  Received service, in part, from one of the owners who was friendly and accommodating.  Always nice to see the owners personally invested in their business and interacting with their customers.  My one and only moment of hesitation was on hearing that rice does not come with the main dish.  But on obtaining the bill, my opinion is that a large bowl of rice is both economically viable and highly recommended.",

During certain times of the year, they offer a Thali Platter during lunch. It's definitely the way to go. It includes two entrees, spinach, lentils, and naan bread. I'm salivating just thinking about it! I guess I may have to go for lunch today.",

    "text": "As a disclaimer, this review is based on delivery fulfilled by Grubhub and not eating at the actual restaurant. In any case the food was very subpar and overpriced. Avoid at all costs.  Being that this is Scottsdale I expect food to be expensive, which is fine if it's good. Not the case at Taj Mahal. First, I ordered the Taj Naan ($6.99) which was described as naan stuffed with tandoori chicken and onions. What I actually received were a few pieces of soggy hot-pocketish bread stuffed with very fine meat with little flavor. The bigger fail was the lamb vindaloo I ordered at the price of (gasp) $18.99. While the vindaloo had a good spicy flavor, the portion size was ridiculous for the price...a small styrofoam container with probably only four chunks of lamb and a few potatoes. While spicy, it was way greasier than most vindaloos I've had in the past. Additionally, no complementary rice or naan were included for that exorbitant price.   To top it all off and add to insult to injury, the delivery bag had no utensils or napkins. Kind of makes it difficult to eat when you're in a hotel room.  I'm still a big fan of Grubhub delivery and have had some amazing experiences, more so in bigger, better food cities such as New York and Los Angeles. Unfortunately Taj Mahal was a fail and as a result I will most definitely never patronize the brick and mortar restaurant.",

I had to go to the store to get some rice to make, which completely defeated the purpose of ordering from this place.  What a rip off!!

    "text": "Average Food. Loud, Unprofessional & Brash Host  This place is highly rated and that is what drew me  and my friends here on Christmas Day. Here's what happened. This might be hard to believe but its True. I'm not a fan of writing lengthy negative yelp reviews.  1. Host (heavy set Indian Punjabi guy) comes to take the order, writes all the items. We ordered a range of items from lamb, chicken, biriyani and pulao. Host asks for spice level.. My friend asks host if he is asking for any specific item, Host responds that he's referring to \"everything\" (At this point my friend and rest of us didnt like his tone) and not just one item. So we told him mild.. Till now everything was fine.   2. During the course of our meal, he came up to our table 3 times asking the exact same questions(trying to make conversation)  a. how the food was(which was fine by us) b. how he is seeing so many people from california today visiting his restaurant  c. tried to \"settle\" things with my friend that if they were \"good\" 3. On the last two of the three occasions, he jokingly taunted my friend by telling my friend's wife \"she is with this man\". Even tried making a funny comment at his daughter. He jokingly asked us if we had been \"driven out of California that we were at that restaurant \". When we asked for the check he also said we could leave pay a couple of thousand dollars to which my friends wife said that he could give us a complementary meal. Following it he again mocked us. I don't think any sane host ever behaves like this 4. He was rude to his staff (seemed mostly mexican) including yelling at them, talking to them in an undignified tone. He was also talking in a boisterous manner even with other customers trying to please them. Has no sense of customer service or class whatsoever.  5. During the \"driven out of California\" comment I lost my cool and told him that we werent interested in making conversation with him and needed to get the check. As he walked away he said in a snide manner that \"It was my lucky day that he fed me\".  6. He yelled at the waiter again asking them to ring us up and gave a paper check with extremely poor handwriting and added a 20%+ tip(87 dollars was inflated to 106). In order to avoid any further altercation, we just paid everything off and left.  By far the most uncultured unprofessional host i have seen till date. Owner: if you're reading this, please take note and fire him because of the way he behaves with your staff if not anything else. Host: If you happen to be the owner, may god save you and go learn the basics of customer service.",

The chicken was moist and delicious.  Definitely a little on the expensive side but Groupon alleviate a bit. Will definitely return .   Side note - You can't combine the Yelp check-in and Groupon.",

The ambience is great and the owner was really nice he stopped by to make sure everything was upto our expectations! The staff was super nice especially Berney: Every restaurant should have someone as kind and attentive as him! He made our dining experience amazing! I highly recommend this place to everyone.

But happily, from the clean and modern decor, to the exceptional personal and friendly service, to the incredibly delicious food, Taj Mahal knocked it out of the park!  We started with a sampling of every kind of Naan available with raita and assorted chutneys, and followed with wonderfully spicy Chicken Vindaloo (we ordered the \"hot\" which we're happy to report was actually hot, not just \"imperceptibly spiced\" like many other restaurants we've visited), wonderfully rich and tender Chicken Tikka Masala and spectacular tandoori lamb.  The owner (Gil) was friendly and engaging, and made it seem as if we were visiting a friend's home for dinner.  We can't wait to return, and in the interim wish you many wonderful meals at the Taj Mahal!  Thanks, Gil!",

I have been to several Indian restaurants in the Valley and nothing comes to close to the food here.  The prices are slightly higher here than other Indian restaurants but you pay for the quality.  Also, everything (including rice) is a la carte.    We came here for appetizers and chai.  The samosas, pakora, naan, and chai were all very delicious.

We ordered the chicken tiki masala, shrimp bhuna and lamb curry.  The Taki Masala and shrimp were fabulous.  The lamb curry was good, but not as delectable as the others.  The garlic naan is yummy.  I've read some reviews about pricing....for three dishes, rice and naan it was about $65.  A little pricey, but great food. Will definitely be back!",

It's unfortunate that you wouldn't know it exists in Oldtown Scottsdale unless you went out of your way to find it, but what an unexpected treasure it is. The fact that they were able to accommodate on spice level for my boyfriend was wonderful, and the spice level of my own dishes was pleasant and not overpowering like some can be. The owner even came over to introduce himself. This place has a great atmosphere like what you would expect in Scottsdale, but the personal touch of making us feel welcomed and appreciated for coming in really made the whole experience for us. Would recommend to anyone, however be aware that at dinner time, ordering from the menu can really add up! We had a bill of over $70, but it was still worth it.",

    "text": "Both my daughter and I were in attendance, along with about a dozen friends.   I was looking forward to trying another place in old town Scottsdale, as it had been quite some time since we have dined in this area. Another bonus was that I would get a chance to catch up with my daughter over dinner.   I had just arrived from the Airport on a business trip, and she picked me up to take me to this establishment.  Upon arrival, I immediately was greeted by Gil and his wife - the owners of this place. I introduced myself and my daughters, and were promptly seated in our own dining area since we were such a large group.  Unbeknownst to Gil, I had actually dined at their Prescott location a few times. So, their food quality was not unfamiliar to me; and I was hoping for the same experience here in Scottsdale.  Everyone ordered individual dishes to their liking (or experimentation). My daughter ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala. I ordered the Tandoori Chicken.  The verdict? Absolutely delightful!   Both the chicken dishes we had were prepared to perfection both in consistency and taste. Now, the portions were smaller that what I am normally accustomed to, but that did not detract from the quality of the food whatsoever.  The Basmati rice that came with our meal was always quite tasty. It wasn't dry and overcooked as is the normal case from recent experiences in various other Indian Food establishments.  As my daughter and I were leaving, after settling the bill, Gil was so grateful for our visit that he asked if we could stay just 5 extra minutes as he wanted to express his gratitude by making us a special dessert.   Neither my daughter nor I ever turn down dessert, so we opted to stay. Gil assured us that we would not be disappointed.  And after the short wait, we were presented with such a wonderful treat that we both unequivocally exclaimed that we were glad we stayed!",

The quantity of food is pitifully small.  Never came across such greedy owners.  Everything is served in a five inch round container....even the Chicken Biryani that we ordered.  It had three small pieces of Chicken and some rice.  Now we all know that Rice is cheap but they still skimp on it.  2.  The wheat bread we ordered was half cooked...which we got after a long time. Everything was insipid. 3. Everything is overpriced, for a party of four, our bill was more than 130.00 4. The owner is loud and obnoxious.  You can hear him a mile away, his laughter, his unappealing jokes, ...we came here to have a quiet dinner ..not to listen to him as he moves from table to table. There are many other good Indian restaurants in this area...avoid this one.",

    "text": "We will definitely be eating here again! This review is for a take out order placed over the phone.  Have to admit that when we began looking at the take out containers... we were a bit underwhelmed. They didn't look like very big portions. This was our first time trying this restaurant and the concern was that we were not getting our money's worth. Also one of our containers was only a little over half way full. We called the restaurant back to tell them about our concerns and the owner could not have been more gracious in hearing us out. He made sure that we received everything in our order, explained that each container was 16 oz., and then immediately offered to replace the container of chicken tika masala that was only a little over half way full. The owner delivered our chicken tika masala himself! And even brought an extra order of naan.  As it turns out that the containers were actually really misleading. They appeared to be very small, but in reality contained a decent sized portion.  And truth is... the food is delicious!!! Worth every penny!   So to the owner of this restaurant (I'm so sorry that I didn't catch your name) Thanks so much for going the extra mile to make your customers happy!  I know I've been mostly talking about the customer service received, but the quality of the food here is also excellent! Everything was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for some good cuisine!",

    "text": "When we entered...the aroma of exotic spices was intoxicating and got us excited for Indian Cuisine.  At the time of this review this is a newly opened Indian Restaurant located in Old Town Scottsdale. You can sit at the bar or at a comfortable table or booth in the dining room. Music from India fills the air and Indian TV is there to watch on the wall. The owner was very welcoming and friendly, he took our order and in reasonable time we were served.  We shared Fish Vindaloo (maui maui) ( $17.99)  and Chicken Biryani ($15.99). The choice of naan was included with our meals. Everything was pretty darn amazing! I recently had Chicken Biryani at another Indian Restaurant and the Biryani here at Taj Mahal certainly was TEN TIMES Better! It was like a roller coaster of flavors in my mouth. The chicken was moist flavorful chicken thighs, laced with exotic spices, tasty nuts, fresh herb and sweet raisins added the just right touches to this dish. This dish was really REALLY great! The Fish Vindaloo was perfectly prepared with a spicy, tangy tomato based sauce that went really well with the fresh made and tasty garlic naan. The naan wasn't the chewy kind but was very tasty.  At this time I didn't try enough of the food to know if this is five star but I'm thinking it's the best Indian Food I tried in years.  The owner is very certain that he serves the best Masala anywhere and told me that I must try it next time.  Portions are enough and prices run slightly higher than other Indian Restaurants I've been too but the food here had more ingredients, more flavors and seemed like better quality proteins so to me it seemed worth it.  4.5 stars",

I purchased a Groupon because I have tried this place before and was so impressed by it I figured it was a good deal. That was a huge mistake. We came in and it was a Saturday evening and the place was dead. We should have left right then and there but we figured that people were out and about and Old Town. We ordered our food and the three types of Curry looked and tasted the same. The butter chicken, the chicken korma, and the chicken tikka masala had nothing special about any dish to differentiate between them. We ordered the assorted naan and more than half of the basket was burnt. Take a look at the picture for evidence. We did not want to be rude and the waiter was great and the service was wonderful and the owner came by and said hello. However this place in the terms of quality has gone to garbage. I used to swear by this place and now I am embarrassed to have even picked this as a place to eat this evening. There was hardly any spice difference in any of the dishes and for $16.99 I would have assumed that the portion would be slightly larger than what we were given. I do not think that it was even enough food to have fed my 10 pound puppy. Save your money and save yourself the troubles of unauthentic Indian food and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "So great to have a really nice Indian restaurant now in Scottsdale (we knew the Prescott location, and have enjoyed great food there too over the years).   A good sign was that there seemed to be a continuous stream of Brits coming in for take outs, and one thing the British can do is sniff out the best Indian food!  Full disclosure- I am a displaced Brit currently living in Scottsdale always on the look out for good Indian culinary delights.  The food was excellent, I had the butter chicken which was perfectly spiced with good quality chicken.  Portion size was good, I managed to eat it all, but it was a push.  Kristina had a lamb curry, very very spicy which she needs (due to dulled down taste buds after too much hot Thai food in her youth!).   Sandy, the friendly owner, served us and we chatted about this, that and Basis. We are so happy that the restaurant has opened in Scottsdale, and will be regulars. Highly recommend you give it a try!",

What an incredible dish, so tasty I would have licked the bowl clean if I were not in polite company. The fragrant basmati rice was a perfect complement and the garlic-cilantro naan I ordered as a side made a delicious vehicle for scooping up every bit of the boti masala sauce. Before the actual meal, I ordered what they call a Taj-mopllitan, an excellent mango based martini.  Service was very friendly and ... very lively - I'm certain my dining companions will agree with me here. The restaurant is a bit of a drive for me but I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit(s) there!",

I have not had much Indian food since moving to the Valley, but this happened to be the best Indian dish I've had since I've moved here.  I ordered Lamb Vindaloo with a side of Aloo paratha, the Lamb was delicious, the paratha, mmm... not the way I had expected it to be.  I honestly could not care less about the paratha!  The Lamb was absolutely stunningly pleasing to my palate.  I asked for the level 1 hot.  If you like spicy food, but don't like the food too hot to enjoy the flavors, this is your spice level.  The server said it was the \"American Hot\".  I thought it was just right.  I would agree that the prices might be a little high for the amount of the serving... but then, I was stuffed after eating half my serving of Lamb Vindaloo.  Also, there were about 20 of us, it did take some time to get the food, so I do think the complaints about time-to-get food may have some truth to them.  I'm going to stop by for lunch to see how long it takes to get a lunch served.  I will update.  Update:. I returned the same Week to grab dinner for take out.  I noticed out front that lunch is served buffet style.  As you can see, I can't wait to return.  Yummy.  Thanks for hosting the September 2016 #ISCUYE!!!  Return Factor: 100%",

They always research restaurants before coming to Phoenix - gotta find new places to Yelp!  Anyway, this was one of the first places they wanted to try.  We had a large number of dishes which John B. ordered (he's British, so I think that makes him an expert on Indian food, since it's the only edible thing in Britain).  I eat spicy food, but I'm not a huge fan of the type of flavor that makes you lick bread or go running for the bathroom.  Maybe because of this, my two favorite dishes were the more mild ones.  If you come here, do not pass up the vegetable korma and the butter chicken.  I could have devoured an entire plateful of both of those dishes.  In fact, I think I did.  They also make a nice iced Indian Chai tea that comes with a free refill.  10/10 will be back.",

Sometimes that great Indian flavor can be found in your own backyard.  The Taj Mahal has a nicely diversified menu that does not overwhelm you but has a well-balanced variety of dishes from which to choose.  When we were there the waitstaff were very attentive and helped make the meal memorable. Water was filled regularly and requests for more to drink were asked at the perfect time.  The food was scrumptious. We ordered four dishes and naan for four people. Two were vegetable and two were meat. A nice balance. We ordered all the dishes  to be medium on the spicy scale. A good choice as everyone was happy. I asked for extra hot sauce so I could make the lamb vindaloo a little hotter.  The bullet naan we ordered was an interesting change from garlic naan.  The whole experience was delightful and I heartily recommend this establishment.",

It was all so incredible! The owner stopped by several times to ask if we needed anything, and even treated us to a delicious complimentary dessert! Do yourself a favor and have dinner here!

Thanks for the good hospitality I wish this place the best and becoming better for next time I will recommend it to others maybe they will have better experience than me but not with the Chicken Masala that I had.  I've been trying a lot of Indian restaurants and I know that each Indian chef has his own taste from his own city, but what I would do to improve in small details such as drinks; my juice was a full cup with half ice, the rice that I ordered was not enough (like two spoons only!) and cold too, the chicken wasn't cooked enough. If I was living in Arizona I would come again and give him another chance because this place looks good and clean and just need to fix these few things, Thanks anyways and sorry for this disappointed taste.",

We ordered chicken tikka masala, and the owner threw in an extra chicken dish, 4 pieces of tandoori chicken, and garlic nan.  Everything was perfect.  And for ice tea, it was a type of chai tea, so yeah it was tea, but had a spice to it.  Just phenomenal all around.  Can't wait to go back next time I am in town.",

    "text": "My husband really wanted Indian food since we do not have a place in our town that serves it, so we read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give Taj Mahal a try.  Wow!! This place is amazing!  We were greeted by the owner as we walked in.  He was extremely personable and very welcoming.  We ordered the chicken tikka marsala and garlic naan.  The food was incredibly flavorful with just the right amount of spice.  After the meal, my husband said this was the best meal we have had on vacation, so far. If you like Indian food, I would highly recommend Taj Mahal.",
