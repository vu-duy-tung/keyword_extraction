It's a great pickup for a morning office meeting or an even better late night snack after a night of fun. My personal fav is the pink icing with sprinkles, although the caramel long john is quickly catching up. I could go there every day.",

I never minded the cash thing but the only con to this particular bosa in my opinion was the lack of variety. No French cruellers no maple old fashioned no blueberry cake donuts or cherry fritters. So far my top two is the one in Tempe and the one in Chandler because Tempe has the most variety and the Chandler is just the closest to me.   Even though they screwed up my order slightly I love bosa anyways",

I live in scottsdale so when I realized that they made me an iced t with coffee in it (total mistake, done it myself) I was driving by the McDowell store and thought I'd ask them to trade my awful drink for a regular tea. The lady explained to me that they were franchise and had nothing to do with that store. So....I explained to her that a medium iced t just cost her and every other Bosa donut,  a customer. I understand that they are owned separately but for reals, an iced t? Ideally, she should have explained the franchise thing to me, changed my drink and called the other store to inform them that their tea was bad. I will never go to any Bosa again. I did call the Chandler store and told her the tea had been mixed with coffee and she thanked me and apologized but it's just unbelievable that the asshole at the McDowell store wouldn't just give me an Iced t.",

However, be glad that you found this review, because I'm about to tell you that a road to religious enlightenment *does* still exist for you -and it's much simpler than the Noble Eightfold Path.  If it wasn't already obvious, your quest will both start and end quite conveniently at the Bosa Donuts on McDowell Rd.  And you'll be pleased to learn that no matter what you order, this shortcut to a life of fulfillment won't cost you any more than a few dollars and cents.  There are a near-infinite number of conceivable menu combinations that can help you quickly unlock your spiritual rebirth, however I'm going to recommend two particular ingredients as the fastest and surest way to eternal bliss:  1) Buttermilk Donuts 2) Taro smoothies with boba  At this point, you should already have stopped reading this review and made haste to the closest form of transportation at hand.  Once you've arrived, you'll be too far too preoccupied with all the revelation happening in your mouth to remember to thank me - or anyone else -for leading you to Bosa.  And I won't blame you.  On the path to salvation, selfishly and voraciously indulging in buttermilk donuts and boba smoothies is sooooo much better than just being nice to people.",

    "text": "There was a HAIR fried into a donut hole. When I called to see if they could deliver a replacement order, they said no. Very understandable so I asked for a refund. She said she wanted to see so I had to drive all the way back. Fine. When I got there, I showed her the hair and she took it, didn't even look and violently throw it away asking well where's the box? I told her I didn't have the box of donuts because obviously I throw the rest of the donut holes away. She said then no refund. I was told to bring the donut hole with the hair back, which I did and instead of being rude to me they should have been sympathetic to the fact that A HAIR WAS FRIED INTO THE DONUT!!! And served with a side of extreme rudeness.",

    "text": "4 stars for the Buttermilk Bar, 2-3 stars for the Original Glazed Donut and Apple Fritter.  I came in on a Sunday before heading to the airport, and it was empty at 4:30pm. The donuts didn't look that appetizing in the case, but we figured we had to at least try them since we were already there. I ended up purchasing a dozen to bring back for my co-workers ($7-$8, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bosa-donuts-scottsdale?select=644Utn9Y4lqV4i5K6pD3pw#644Utn9Y4lqV4i5K6pD3pw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bosa...</a>), and we tried:  -Original Glazed Donut (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bosa-donuts-scottsdale?select=644Utn9Y4lqV4i5K6pD3pw#BI5rlLME1mQCFE3M0iw8pw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bosa...</a>): Pretty decent. Definitely nowhere close to the best glazed donut I've ever had, but it was a good donut. Not as fluffy as I'd like but at least it wasn't super sweet. -Apple Fritter: Eh.. skip! There was too much cinnamon flavor or something, and I didn't like this version of the apple fritter at all. -Buttermilk Bar: The best out of the three! I normally don't get buttermilk bars, but wanted to try it since it got such good reviews, and I wasn't disappointed! I loved the crispyness of the outside and the glaze. It was a little on the sweet side, but not too bad. Highly recommended! They also have a chocolate covered buttermilk bar but apparently those sell out early.  Although it says \"Best Donuts in Town\" on the Bosa Donut box, don't have too high of expectations. At least the lady who was working here was really nice and parking was plentiful. They also have boba drinks available and shaved ice if you're looking for something other than donuts.",

The first time not really counting because I went with a coworker and didnt buy anything.  BUT, I did ask if I could buy 2 holes (one glazed and one chocolate cake) instead of a dozen.  I sometimes have issues with fried items.  So I wanted to sample it first.  The gal just gave me the two and said, \"Enjoy!\"  I had no revenge of the holes the remainder of the day!  Wh00t Wh00t!     But seriously, how awesome is it that she just gave me 2 holes.    This morning, for some strange reason (the baby maybe ;) had me craving a donut.  So, off to Bosa myself and another coworker went!  I got a dozen holes (6 glazed, 6 chocolate) and a maple bar.  The maple bar I'm saving for tomorrow morning...i hope    I honestly think the glazed holes are my favorite, reminding me of a Krispy Kreme glazed.  But glazed or chocolate...these donuts rock!  My coworker even thought so too.    I would have taken a photo of the holes, but they didnt have a chance.  I eated them.  :)  I shall have to resist the urge to become a frequent BOSA customer!  RESIST Damnit.  RESISTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!",

Not only is she rude, she takes her sweet little freaky time to come 10 feet from donut shelf to window.  She is the epitome of Freddy Kruger.

But I was drawn here after having their buttermilk donut.  I finally brought myself to stop in this donut shop after having had a Buttermilk Bosa donut a few months ago at work. What an amazingly good donut, when it is fresh.  I've had that donut 3 times and the first 2 times I had it, the donut was simply AMAZING.  Something that tastes that good scares me.  I was afraid I would be drawn to this place over and over for that donut.  So, on a weak day, when I just wanted something sweet.... NOW.  I pulled into this shop at about 4 in the afternoon.  I see the yummy \"specialty donut\" in the display and quickly order it.  I get in my car and I don't immediately pull off as I whip out that donut to break off the first piece.  I take a bite and I'm suddenly shocked.... disappointed.  It was STALE.  I wondered how long that donut had been in the display.  It wasn't very good.  i have resolved to never return -- a lie!  I should stop lying to myself.   Nothing that good could possibly, truly be that good.   Someone at work brought 3 dz of these donuts this week.  I resisted.  I resisted.  but I'm sure.. in that weak moment, I'm returning for that buttermilk yummy goodness.  But I've learned my lesson, I'm going first thing in the morning... I want a fresh one.  Yumms!",

Maybe it's because I'm from LA where we have more donuts choices in one place than some stores have chairs. As I'm eating this, I would say these donuts are better than your local grocery store's donuts but is nothing to write home about.",

I love this place for their donuts and awesome savory breakfast sandwiches, and there is a drive thru for when you're feeling especially gluttonous and lazy :). The donuts are light on the inside, dense on just the outside layer, and not overly sweet. I have yet to have a bad donut from Bosa, but I especially love the old fashioned. The breakfast sandwiches are great, I love to get them on a croissant, and though I'm pretty sure the eggs are precooked and just microwaved like at McDonald's, the light and airy croissant just takes the whole thing up a notch.",

But as all businesses know the staff they hire to obtain their brand must have an ethical background for customer service. Although the building isn't up to date and it is not that aesthetically pleasing, the customer service has taking a nose dive. This morning I woke up ready for my bagel and cream cheese and iced coffee, I had my other two friends with me in vehicle as we ordered through the drive through. The woman taking our order \"Danny\" would continuously talk over our orders and didn't give us a chance to repeat them thoroughly back. Given they didn't look too busy, we pull up to the window and asked if they got our orders correctly, \"Danny\" followed by talking back to me \"You never ordered that!\" With an aggressive abysmal tone. I am in no way a nagging yelper, but Danny deserved to be called out for her ill mannered behavior toward a paying customer! I will continue to come back because the food hasn't put a bad taste in my mouth just yet. I just would love if \"Danny\" in the highlighted green shirt would have a little more respect.",

    "text": "I blame Bosa for resurfacing my donut obsession. I thought all donuts tasted the same. I thought they all tasted fluffy, sugary and heavenly, but the same. I have been a lover of the donut since my early childhood when my Dad would surprise me with a stop at our favorite donut store during a round of errands. The owner also happened to know my Dad so my one donut turned into a full bag of donuts and I felt as if I had just won the jackpot (even though my Dad still only let me pick one out to actually eat at that moment). But now let me fast forward many, many moons and I'll actually begin my review of Bosa.   Bosa does not sell your ordinary donut. Well, actually they do sell some of the classics but the difference with Bosa is that they make their donuts truly holey (pun intended). Whatever they do to them makes the donut victim enter a world of pure oblivion as an sugar high hits instantly upon first delicious bite.   So you go to Bosa for the first time, you walk into a very sparse shop that was definitely once a fast food restaurant and you see a counter of donuts staring at you. Like my Dad taught me all those years ago, sadly I can only have one, so what to do? The answer is easy, even for someone with major menu anxiety like myself: get the BUTTERMILK donut. Don't ask questions and just do it. Don't think to yourself...\"that's way too big, I'll just get a donut hole.\" No. Order the buttermilk donut, have a serious talk with your will power, tell your will power to hold you back from eating the entire thing and get the buttermilk donut. Why? Because it will allow you to taste a donut you didn't know existed. It tastes like pure buttermilk immersed into a delicious fried sweet baked good. You'd think the bread inside would taste like normal donut bread, but it doesn't. It tastes like your eating donut bread infused with buttermilk cream and yet it's just the donut being that fluffy and moist. Now thanks to this donut, I will have to avoid driving on McDowell until I allow myself to have a donut again because I know that if I pass by Bosa (that has a DRIVE THROUGH by the way), there is no way I'll be able to drive by without stopping inside to say hello to my favorite donut.",

    "text": "Checked out Bosa donuts recently for the first time and was impressed. Arrived at 3pm and expected donuts to be fresh but not this fresh. They were sweet and tender. Super soft. Good selection of classics with a few original variations. Place was quiet, but I imagine that during peak times this place is hopping.  But glad it wasn't crazy so i could take my time picking my treats. Had a glazed donut with toasted coconut. Delicious. Went back for another one, their glazed cinnamon crunch that was super soft and yummy. Lastly we had the buttermilk glazed. It was like a sweet glazed cake. Definitely will be back! Sorry no pics, they went in my mouth too fast!",

I did the drive through and I must say that intercom sucked. I hope that wasn't the status quo because that speaker box looked... and sounded... like it had been ran over the prior night during a drunken Scottsdale party. You just have to order and hope for the best.  The drive through was a touch slow IMHO. Two concocted drinks came out before the donuts which I found odd since all they had to do was grab donuts off a shelf versus making the drinks.",

Maybe it's this location, maybe the staff didn't have their morning cup of joe. I had really high hopes for the donuts since I have a sweet tooth.  First off, if you run out of donuts before mid morning, that's a problem for a donut shop. Coffee should never be served out of a dispenser. Secondly, if your staff has to growl at customers, that's not my idea of a wake up call. I love donuts, even better you offer boba. Maybe we can try this again, at your Arcadia location.",

    "text": "Due to a heavy footed neighbor upstairs in our hotel, I was up and about around 6am.  I knew I needed some coffee and donuts.  Dunkin Donuts is right near my hotel so I went and got a cup of coffee there.  Then headed here to get some donuts.  The Yelpers of Scottsdale did me right.  These donuts were very good....not Marys donuts good (Marys holds a special place in my heart and will always be my favorite), but maybe 2nd place ;-).    Still a 5 star joint! Placed my order for a chocolate covered buttermilk bar, a glazed raised, a chocolate raised and a crumb raised.  Total was $3.70 for 4 donuts.  Not shabby at all.  Here is how the donuts stacked up.  Chocolate Buttermilk Bar-  DAMN!  This was one of the best donuts I can ever remember eating!  This thing was crisp on the outside for a little crunch, dense on the inside (almost like a pound cake) for a good \"cake like\" chew and had a ton of chocolate on it.  During the bites you could pick out the distinct buttermilk flavor.  This thing was awesome and I'm definitely coming back before I leave to get more of these.  They also had them in maple frosting and something else too.  Delicious!  Glazed-  Not too shabby.  Very light and airy and not too sweet.  Definitely a good donut and I would get it again.  Crumb- Pretty tasty also.  Good crumb topping and light and airy like the glazed.  Chocolate Raised- My wife ate that one and I didn't try it.  She liked it though and that's good enough for me.  If it was as good as the other 3 donuts, I'm sure it was great.  The lady at the counter was nice as can be and they even have a drive through!  If I lived in the area, this would definitely be my go to donut spot.  Bravo for the recommendations Scottsdale Yelpers....Bravo!",

Plus a few maple bars which is my go to treat anywhere. My guest grabbed the chocolate  with crushed peanuts donut + apple fritter. Absolutely  some fresh donuts and with that line of people coming in & out you can see why there fresh.   Open 24hrs a day you can get a craving anytime and satisfaction will be guaranteed.

While I'm not a fan of cake donuts ( these tend to be more dense and sweet) even those served here are amazing.   You can sit and enjoy your treat at this location as it has ample seating and free wifi.   What to expect are classic donut flavors. This is not the kind of shop where you're gonna find some off-the-wall crazy flavors. Think glazed, boston, buttermilk etc.   They have other stuff on the menu, but it doesn't impress me like the donuts do. Not that it's bad, just doesn't stand out.   This place is worth checking out!

The speed at the drive thru is moderate, depending on how busy they are.  The fact that I can get a Thai tea boba at a drive-through is fantastic. Not the best one I've had, but it does the job. The donuts are always fresh. My personal favorite is the Boston Cream. I have also gotten a few sandwiches at this location. The turkey is just cheapie lunch meat, so I want impressed.  The bacon, egg & cheese is great on either a bagel or croissant. Neither are anything to write home about, but makes for a quick and sturdy breakfast.",

Realized what made the big difference in these donuts was, they use to use Dawn food flour products and yes there's a difference. They now go with Westco and the donuts are heavy and no different then Dunkin Donuts. Oil isn't fresh either. The once very special donut is no longer lite and melt in your mouth. Tried several locations and found it to be the same through out the valley.  So no more donuts for the employees. Have to scout for another bakery. These donuts use to be such a treat for everyone in the office.  These Donuts are the best!!  I actual crave these donuts! They are light and delicate. And fried to perfection. Have never had such an awesome donut ever. There croissants and French breads are delicious as well. They also serve up sandwiches and smoothies! You can't go wrong when choosing BoSa has your one stop shop for great donuts, croissants and French bread...",

The selection is amazing and you can't beat the price either. I'm from NYC and some places charge $3-$4 a donut. I got half a dozen here for under $5. If I had space in my luggage, I would have ordered a dozen b/c I think that was under $9.   As for the donut itself, it was so soft and chewy. I ate one immediately and they survived my flight the next day back to NY. That is real quality. Would definitely visit again if i'm back in AZ.",

Glazed doughnuts I think are the tell of good place. If they can't do a glazed doughnut right then what the hell are you doing at that doughnut place, get yourself to bosa!! They are fluffy but not full of air, and just a delicious success. I'm also a fan of the smaller and more sense cake doughnuts. They have plenty of drinks and coffee and other things, but honestly I've never had anything but doughnuts here.  Be prepared when ordering to hear the dreadful 'we are out' they do run out of different doughnuts intermittently. Don't freak out at them, just try another doughnut!

I knew they had a drive thru, but I wanted to see the donuts so I went inside.  Big mistake!!  I could have bought him one in the drive thru and kept myself working out 5 days a week.  Now it seems I am doomed to 7 days plus an extra jog or two.  Every donut looked so puffy and light.  I typically get filled donuts, but I saw the buttermilk bars and there was a massive tray of them.  As a child they were my favorite a local bakery, but since the bakery closed they have been dry everywhere else.    They also had filled croissants and I decided to try a ham, cheese, and jalapeno one.  For my last move I added in a French Cruller as it looked so darn good.   Well the cruller was devoured on the drive home.  Best one i have ever had by a long shot.  It was so light and sweet.  I kept thinking save a bite for the husband, but it wasn't meant to be!  While handing my husband his sugar donut I feared squishing it as it was so light and airy.  My husband took one bite and the incredulous yum rang out.  He polished it off and proceeded to hone in on my buttermilk bar.  Well I am okay with sharing because frankly this is an artery killer breakfast.  It was an excellent buttermilk bar.  That rich interior that is darker with the sin of buttermilk was present and it was lovely.  Not done though I popped the croissant in the microwave for 15 seconds as the lady at the store recommended and then into the toaster oven for a moment.  Dang this is breakfast, lunch, or dinner food and so good.  The croissant was light, flaky, and buttery and the guts gooey and delicious.  I spared one bite for my husband who asked what else came in the croissants.    In my mind i see the hours sign...5am-10pm and even worse it is near my office and my home.  Well I can only hope that if I eat too many I will get sick of it, because I am already planning another journey.  It would be cruel of me not to share these luscious donuts with everyone i know...",

If your measure of donuts is based on comparing Bosa to Dunkin Donuts and the supermarket, then yes, they are five star worthy. If you honestly compare Bosa to other donuts, many better ones come to mind. Randy's donuts in LA. K's Donuts in Sherman Oaks, CA is far superior. The Donut Man in Glendora, CA which features the strawberry donut - a moment please, for that is a donut. I think of my childhood when once in a while my mother would allow me to sin, and let me have the whole wheat donut at Chock Full O Nuts in NYC. That was a donut. When you compare Bosa to such American treasures, it falls flat and looks average. Sorry Bosa, although you made a valiant effort, in the world of donuts you fall in the same category as Winchell's.",

    "text": "Incredible. As they were building this donut site. I passed it everyday on the way to school. I thought to myself: stay away--don't even look at it. I did so well for the last 5 months but then....unfortunately I ended up with visions of donuts dancing in my brain last night (couldn't sleep, and had recently watched \"Boogie Nights\" for the umpteenth time--you know, the part where Don Cheedle stops to get his preggie GF some donuts?) and thought, Ok, it's Sunday AM, Dad used to get them all the time. I'll just get a couple in the morning. I went, I saw, I became ravenous, I ordered...a dozen for a little over 7 bucks. How could I resist?   These donuts kick butt. Amazing. DD has no clue compared to this place. The rasp. filled was devoured the minute I got home. The only complaint? (thus the 4 stars), was that the Asian lady helping me said out of the blue \"you have baby?\" I looked at her like, WTF? She said again, \"you have baby?\" I asked her if she was asking if I was pregnant (not a good question to ask a woman who just ordered a dozen donuts...esp. when she IS NOT), or if I already had \"baby\"? she then said \"before?\" I looked at her and said, \"why in the world are you asking me that question?\" She says nothing. I was tempted to ask her if she had hemmorhoids, but instead I walked out with my donuts checking my side reflection in the mirror (stomach, flat), pre-donut scarf. It was almost a total buzz kill, but I recovered by the time I got home. Maybe it was my hefty busoms, or maybe she wanted to make a trade, who knows.  Note to Asian lady--don't ask strangers about their baby making capacities while they are ordering your donuts-- or no tippie for you! Your donuts rule, though!",

I love that they have a drive-thru and the customer service is wonderful every time. They always get your order out super fast, I'm usually out of there in less than 3 minutes! I usually stop by around 7:30 and I think that's when the donuts are fresh because they come out so warm, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I always get a maple bar and a cappuccino to go along with it (warning: cappuccino is scolding hot!). They have a lot of different things on their menu that I want to try one day just haven't ventured off to do yet. Their croissants filled with ham and cheese looks amazing and if its quality is anywhere near their quality of donuts, I'm down. They also have boba drinks that I am curious to try, considering donut shops don't usually serve boba I am not expecting it to wow me, but if it does more power to Bosa! I had my favorite donut shop growing up in California that I always went out of my way to go to and I was so happy to find one here! Bosa Donuts, you will be the fat death of me, but I forgive you.

I have to think. Is there any other donut shop better..... NO. Although putting sugar in your mouth is good by itself, Bosa has some real special way of making their donuts crispy on the outside and real soft and fluffy or dense on the inside. Dunkin is great and will always be getting bigger and bigger like some other donut shop we all use to know. But Bosa is just down right yummy.",

I grabbed a jelly filled, and it was divine. The glaze was sweet and wonderful, the jelly was superb, and I loved loved loved the dough. I am now a Bosa convert, and will join in the cheering next time they are presented.",

This Scottsdale location is much better managed than the Chandler store, so I give them credit for that--it's cleaner and the donuts are much fresher.  I only wish Phoenicians could experience a great donut, which will never come from places like Bosa, Krispy Kreme, or Dunkin Donuts.",

I stopped in to get a dozen and walked inside, since I'm not a big fan of drive-thrus and I actually enjoy looking at the donuts I'm gonna take. I picked out a variety of yeast (personal favorite) and cake donuts, sprinkles, jelly-filled, chocolate glaze, powdered sugar, peanuts and coconut flakes. I had the raspberry jelly and it was so good, also the chocolate glazed with rainbow sprinkles was solid. Unfortunately I had a third donut, a chocolate cake with peanuts that was also tasty.  A dozen regular (not fancy) donuts cost a bit over $10, which I thought was a wonderful deal considered the amount of donuts they have to choose from. Only bummer was that there was only 1 maple donut and it broke when the woman grabbed it with the tongs, so I chose not to get that.   Place was steady with business and they had enough employees taking orders at the counter and for the drive-thru. Glad this place exists!",

We were going to order 4 donuts but it was cheaper to get a half dozen.  We ordered 2 cinnamon rolls, 2 glazed donuts, a chocolate glazed donut, and the long chocolate donut thingy. We went there at 11... and the donuts were still incredibly fresh. Anyone who's had donuts, know that most donuts become stale after about 2 hours. So this was a pleasant surprise. I had the cinnamon roll which was delicious; not too much cinnamon which I tend to find is a typical problem.  Im having to restrain myself from eating another donut so I don't feel like a fat a**.  Will definitely return. Why go to Dunkin Donuts, which isn't as good and is a chain, when we should support our local spots!",

They are super inconsistent. The location is clean enough inside, but the parking lot and drive-through are always a total mess. My primary complaint is on the ham and cheese croissant. At other locations it is fluffy, warm and cheesy goodness. At this location it's usually a cold log of ham slices wrapped around one slice of white american cheese encased in what tastes like a store bought croissant. I asked the people at my old location and they use two slices of cheese. When I asked the staff at this location, they told me they use 1. Aside from the bad croissant, the women at the drive-through speaker/window are a train wreck every time I go there. They seem Utterly disorganized and there's always a lot of noise on the drive thru speaker.",

Sure, I love me some chocolate and who doesn't love sprinkles, but the DONUT. It has to be the right density. It has to have just enough sweetness to the dough. It has to be fried just right. Really, it's an art.  Bosa has it going on. They can make a basic donut better than most. I'm sure if they got all voodoo donuts crazy on us, it would be tasty too.

So I asked my co-workers where they get their donuts, cause the place I use to go doesn't make butter bars (that I am aware of). That's when I was told that the guy who use to get up in the wee hours of the morning to make the donuts was dead. My childhood favorite is no longer made in store. Hello Bosa Donuts!  My co-workers even told me which Bosa to go to. But they mentioned that it was always super busy. That's how I ended up at the McDowell location in south Scottsdale. This place was pretty busy too and the cars were lined up in the drive-thru at least five or six cars deep.  I'm glad I went inside! The girl who greeted me was in a great mood and very friendly. And you don't get all the aromas in the drive-thru. I chose the three donuts that were requested and let her fill the box with an assortment of her choosing. And I can confirm something I read in another review. A dozen donuts at Bosa cost me nine dollars and change!  Now I've tried the gourmet donuts (of the \"broken\" kind) and also enjoyed the donuts by the guys who specialize in like two varieties. The competition out there is good, but judging by the freshness, the quality, the variety and how quickly they disappeared once I got to work, Bosa Donuts is where I will be going from now on.",

It wasn't overly sweet and had a perfect amount of saltiness and chewy-ness while remaining fluffy and moist. it was a great donut and what I consider a 'bay area style donut'  for no other reason except that i ate this kind of donut while i lived in the bay area. i didn't think anyone else made donuts like this.  until I arrived at Bosa. it's run by orientals which is a good sign when it comes to donuts so I tried a maple bar. oh my gosh! the donut brought back all of those memories of tattling on my step brother when I found his naughty movies and regretting my choice to get a perm at the hair salon once while bored.   this is a bay area style donut! it's not krispy kreme(which is also a delicious donut) and it's not dunkin (which isn't a delicious donut) it's a different donut class of its own.  if you like them chewy and fluffy while a tad sweet and salty go here for your donut pleasure!",

I made a mess in my car eating the crumble donut one morning, but it was so good I didn't regret it. I had a croissant filled with ham and cheese last time I went that was delicious. I give this place 5 stars for a few reasons. My father is a True doughnut connoisseur. He came to visit me, and after I took him there once, he demanded to go there everyday on his trip and proclaimed, 'you just can't get a donut this good anymore'. The other reason is value, you can eat a donut and coffee for a couple dollars. In a world where Starbucks will charge you $5 for a mediocre latte, I'll take Bosa over them anyday.",

The menu was difficult to see because the plastic cover on the display was sun burned and blurry. We ordered some classics knowing there was no way they couldn't have them.  The maple long john was delicious. I haven't seen maple long johns at Dunkin Donuts in a long time so I was loving it. The chocolate frosting could be better but I can't complain too much about chocolate frosting... I mean, come on, it's chocolate frosting! My friend wasn't impressed with the apple fritter. It was crunchy and too sugary.   Here's the kicker. The basic glazed doughnut was amazing. It was so close to a Krispy Kreme doughnut you could have fooled me in a blind taste test. It was perfectly glazed and collapsed just like the best of the best upon first bite.  Next time I have a doughnut craving I will skip the neighborhood Dunkin and ride over to Bosa.",

I stopped by late, about 10pm  and they still had a large selection of donuts, I picked up a dozen to \"sample\" the flavors.  I enjoyed the old fashioned, Boston creme, chocolate filled, raspberry filled, and some classic sugar laden regular donuts.  Delicious and I was on a sugar high.  To add to my sugar high I added a boba Thai coffee large.  Pretty of boba to enjoy my long drive back to the west valley.  I really enjoyed the coffee and it is a rare treat by my home.  I am still craving another excuse to drive here and get another.  I also did sample some shaved ice in the unconventional rainbow fashion. The staff was not use to serving a rainbow shaved ice, but were very accommodating.  He noted they usually only do one flavor, but attempted a 4 flavor ice sample.  It is still great to have shaved ice at 10pm when its 50 degrees outside right?  I also noted breakfast croissants and other breakfast treats, bagels and creme cheese, etc.  I could not really concentrate on that part of the menu, the donuts in the glass cases are mesmerizing.  I imagined sampling them all while I reduced my selection to only 12 donuts.    I can say that the 12 donuts did not last a day on the kitchen island and the donut box is now a empty box of memories.  I hope to visit Bosa again and enjoy another dozen and maybe sample some other items they provide.  I hope you have the opportunity to sample Bosa donuts as well.",

Well, no wonder it was so good, but from here on not ordering the lattes because they only have half and half.",

My parents have been coming here regularly (like, multiple times a week regularly) since this place opened and every time I come to visit they make sure to get me donut in the morning when they know I'm hungover in bed.  Now, I'm only reviewing this place for the donuts.  I didn't even know this place served other breakfasty stuff until I came here myself, but the other pastries & coffee drinks sound good as well.  That being said, when it comes to donuts Bosa is as good as it gets.  They're soft, chewy, and all around yummy...that goes for all varieties (well, the ones I've tasted anyway).  Another good thing...they're CHEAP!  It's not like donuts break the bank anyway, but even compared to chain donut places the donuts here practically cost nothing.    The place itself is not much to look at, but who cares!  All I want is the donuts!",

I'm an apple fritter person through and through but find myself trying all their varieties because everything is so well done. The simple glazed donuts are to die for in their gooey goodness. The fritters are crispy and very flavorful, cannot get much better than this.  I think about these donuts when I am working out at the gym and work harder to make room for them a few times a month. Sometimes I go a little more than I should since they are right down the road from me but it is worth it!",

For some reason, I was recently craving a donut. Maybe there's something in the Phoenix water that makes me do that. I'm not sure. Anyway, I was getting some work done at a nearby cafe and decided to look for a donut shop. Thank you fellow yelpers for introducing me to this little gem. The donuts are super cheap and really yummy. I've been here multiple times and usually opt for the buttermilk bar. Tip: The buttermilk bars at this location are tastier and bigger than the ones at the Tempe location. I've had the chocolate cruller and that one is yummy too.  Considering I'm not much of a donut fan, I will admit that I crave them more since I found this place. If you're looking for an inexpensive yummy treat, I say give this place a shot!",

The first time I went they got my order wrong: whip on the drinks, microwaved boba,  and I had to remind them twice to give us the donut my son ordered although they were glad to take my pament for it.  I was in the area and decided to give them another chance. The donuts really are good and my dad wanted one and coffee. Here is where the game changed lol.   I ordered the coffee and apple fritter for my father. Then, a Thai Iced Tea smoothie with boba. Out came the microwave bowl, ugh. Maybe that's just how some places do it, but it does affect the taste. We recieved our items and my dad liked the coffee and loved the donut. My drink tasted like it had absolutely no sugar in it. I told the employee, very nicely, my issue. She had a blank look. Okay.... I repeated myself and then asked for it to either be remade or I would gladly take another flavor. She looked around for someone and another employee told me that that's the way they taste and if I wanted it sweet I should have gotten the drink just iced, not a smoothie.    Um, no.   I informed her that I had this drink before and it was sweeter than the one I had now. She began looking around for someone else. I repeated all I wanted was for it to be remade or another flavor. She didnt want to, so I told her either remake it or I want my money back.  That was the attention getter, because the manager flew out from the back to tell me I was in NO WAY getting my money back.   WOW!   Okay, all I want is it remade or another flavor. The manager told me again and I again I wansn't getting my money back (okay, already). I said I wanted it remade. She told me it wasnt sweet and I had the plain iced last time. I never met her before in my life and I think I know what I've had. I've had Thai Iced Teas from Bosa and other establishments, always sweet.   She was annoyed that I wouldnt agree with her. I repeated over and over, I wansnt going to argue. Now I was angry. I did want my money back, which she said she would never do. She said she would make it again but I was wrong. Really?! Shouldn't I get what I ordered? What I PAID for? Shouldn't I be able to expect the same product from visit to visit?  All 3 of the employees tasted the mix that was left from making my drink and none of them said it was sweet.   Someone finally remade it. Miraculously, it was sweet.   I will not be going here again. I will not be made to argue over something in which I have given you money.",
