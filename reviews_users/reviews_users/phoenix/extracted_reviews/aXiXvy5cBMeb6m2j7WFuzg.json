Usually you go to a brewery and get your typical brewery food (burgers, fries, wings, etc). But here the food was so UNIQUE! We tried the Chicarrones + Cactus Dip, as well as the Chickpea Tostada! I was hesitant when I first saw the menu, but the blend of flavors was amazing. We finished off with the seasonal pumpkin chimichangas!",

The coffee rub steak tacos were amazing, would recommend to anyone who loves tacos and wants something a little different in a good way.",

Also 5 stars for the food - OMG, I had the honey-marinated chicken taco with spicy goat cheese and I thought I had legitimately died and gone to taco heaven. If you love goat cheese like I love goat cheese, you'd be remiss to not get at least 2 of these tacos.  I give 5 stars for service as well. We sat at the bar and had the big-bearded bartender (trust me, you'll know him when you see him) and he was so incredibly nice and attentive and gave us the suggestion of getting a flight to save a bit of money on the beers we wanted to try.  The thing that knocks it down a notch is the ambiance, or really lack thereof. Don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting a brewery to be some amazing, fantastic adventure in interior design, but they have holes in the ceiling currently covered with black trash bags... It's not a good look.  I still recommend it if you're a major beer lover!",

First time there, they got me for $10 each at the door. I was thinking that it bought me something like a couple of small beer tastes or a taco, etc. But we spent that $20 for basically nothing, because I had to pay the regular price for my beer consumption and food. She got expensive (but tasty) tacos, so her investment was $34 for three tacos. I got a couple of beers, one good (the Helio SASS IPA) and a marginal one (Blackberry Wheat) for my investment of $33 or so. Not a good evening as there was a lousy rap singer on \"stage\" in the parking lot and we had to leave. Disappointing \"festival\" in my opinion.",

Light and came with a buttermilk sauce. The whole table liked em. The individual tacos are amazing! Again, unique.  I  had pork belly and my husband the chorizo.  Both yummy. You can tell it's all home made.  You have to try this place.  Atmosphere is laided back. The beers are all delicious. You have to try them all. The staff is knowledgeable and fun.

I first had an IPA that's one of their house beers. It was very tasty but then again I'm an IPA girl! My next beer was out of the box for me and I'm proud of myself for giving it a go! It was a nut brown ale. One of the best I've ever had and I taste them a lot as that's what my husband likes. I just can't remember the whole name but t was a heavy hitter at about a 10% or more! But it didn't drink like that. It was smooth and very refreshing. I went in a Tuesday so I had the tacos! Omg! So good I got another order to go! Excellent service by Kristen! I'll be back next year when j come through!",

    "text": "Enjoyed a special Valentine's menu last night. We started with a crisp bee's knees belgian blonde made with Arizona mesquite honey. We then moved onto a generous cheese plate that included port derby cheddar, stilton white mango ginger, triple cream brie, beemster, jam and roasted nuts. From there we were served a gorgeous lamb belly served with blood orange sauce, roasted cherry tomatoes and broccolini, toasted pine nuts and burrata. To finish off we were served a delicious prickly pear vinegar pie alsamic whipped mascarpone, dark chocolate and mint. Service was overall pretty good for the busy dining room. Everything I just described (while drooling) was $65 out the door (tax and gratuity included), which was a smoking deal for the meal we had. I will be keeping an eye out for additional special event menus at Helio!",

    "text": "Holy cow! About 6 months ago we started brewery hop, we visit one new brewery per month. Helio Basin might be my favorite so far and it's going to be tough to beat. And to clarify I started gping to breweries long before brewery hop, this place is still in my top 5. Arguably favorite since brewery hop and top 5 overall. What makes this place so awesome, well the beer is awesome, I could drink any one of them at any time. Customer service wasn't but could be better and it might it probably is when they have more staff for busier times. I would also like to note that we didn't try the food today. So here is the bread and butter of what makes this place great aside from the beer. The atmosphere is warm and relaxing. The music is loud enough to hear but quiet enough to hold a conversation or concentrate on studies, kind of like copper star coffee. The juicy part is that they recycle, reuse, locally source and are actively engaged in the community. Examples include turning old kegs into urinals and donating the spent grain to be used as cattle feed on a local ranch, the kicker this same ranch is where they buy their beef. That is just a sneak peek, go in to try the beer and read their \"active in the community\" wall. Awesome place supporting the community!",

We never ordered food or another drink because the service was so OBSCENELY slow. We really wanted to enjoy multiples drinks and food for lunch.  The waitress said \"sorry guys\" but never expanded on that or offered to take a food order. We actually just left cash on the table for our ONE drink because it too so long to get a check. Total time spent: 40 min. Total gained: ONE beer and a ton of frustration.  We ended up leaving for another restaurant because we were so hungry and irritated!!!! Happy to take our business somewhere where we can actually have service provided!  Hands down worst service experienced anywhere in a long time!",

I had a beer, then another... they beers are tasty and one might think that is what matters right? So I have kept coming back to this place, some days there are quite the clientele and it is a very heterogeneous crowd too which appeases me.   But their brown fall brew is amazing. I have come back just for this on a stressful day at work. Just to sit back, have a really good beer can make the difference some times.  The atmosphere is partially standard bar, but it has some space. It isn't big but big enough. I feel that if this becomes the standard in the valley, Phoenix will rise again.",

Autumn Oak Nut Brown, Kaki Imperial Coffee Stout, Robust Porter, and Blackberry Wheat. (Not in that order). All were good. But Brown was different than others I've had. Ordered the Blackberry because it was recommended to pair with the Pulled Chicken Verde pub tacos. The food was more adventurous than I usually try and had ingredients I would never have used. Great. Seared Banana Cornbread for dessert. Wow. Most of the music was good and not too loud for grumpy old me!  May be my new favorite for Phoenix. My husband had the coffee rubbed tri-tip tacos, which of course I tasted. Amazing.   Taking home some Helio Basin mustard hot sauce.     Very clean too. This chef and brewer are great.",

They have a variety of tastes, from cheese crisp and orzo soup for the kids to flavorful pickled veggies with hummus, salad, steak, beers, etc., for the adults. They are extremely friendly, accommodating, and the atmosphere is relaxed and fun.",

    "text": "Although the food was good, the price was high for what you received.  For $12, you get a steak on the stick appetizer with 3 sticks.  You do not get much for that money.  The price could easily be cut in half for that.  The cornbread was just ok.  It tasted dry.  The tacos were good, but the steak taco was not tender and it was cut in huge pieces so when you bite into it all the meat comes out at once.  The pork and pineapple taco was good but the dry onion rings on top did nothing to compliment it.  I took them all off.  If you don't drink beer, there are no other options for drinks on this menu.  I understand the wine license is coming in about 3 months.  For 3 people with a tip, our bill hit $100.  That was not a $100 meal.  I hope this place makes it.  We will not be back.",

    "text": "Chris at the bar was excellent. I started off with the steak sticks with jalapeno pesto with the blackberry wheat beer. Quite spicy but still delicious. Meat was cooked perfectly and it was a significant portion.  Beer had a crispness to it, and went down super easy. After that I had just 1 of the tacos ( it was the day's special, a duck meat but I forget what else was in it) that was absolutely fantastic. The pickled red onions were a nice touch. I also tried their beans with it, the duck fat broth that they came in was to die for. I had the  citrus paradisi with the taco. I am not an IPA guy and usually stay away from anything with a high IBU but this beer was great. It had a blonde, citrusy taste to start and then a slightly bitter taste at the very end. To finish the meal off I did 4 of the ice creams with 4 different beers. The portions on the ice cream were the only small portions of the day, but the flavor were unique ( I would buy the lime ice cream by the gallon if I could). And it allowed me to try the other beers which were great as well. Great beer, fantastic food and on point service. Stop in and have a glass!",

    "text": "When the foodies I work with suggest a new place to grab lunch, I listen. They are the reason why I Yelp! on a regular basis about some pretty cool places. Which is why I am writing about Helio Basin Brewery. And, I've decided to refer to my inspirational co-workers as my \"culinary co-horts\". At least for now...  I regret that I cannot mention the beers, as this was a working lunch and I did not partake. But I will be back because the selection sounds really good. The Blackberry Wheat caught my attention, so more on that later.  Thanks to my culinary co-horts, I had heard them talking about this place from a prior visit. They kinda pumped up my expectations. And based on my meal, I can say that Helio Basin nearly delivered what I was expecting.  Their specialty is tacos. The menu is a little confusing at first (tortilla plates) but you soon realize we are dealing with street tacos here. Very creative street tacos. Banana leaf roasted pork? Spicy coffee rubbed skirt steak? And those are two options I passed on!  The tacos I selected featured beer braised pork belly and chorizo. Besides being creative, these were delicious. This is the first time I've tried pork belly. It was smothered in a pistachio and pine nut mole. Solid. However, the house made chorizo with roasted tomatoes, a fried egg and fresh herbs, was mind blowing. The herbs really kicked up the flavor. My only complaint was that the corn tortillas may have sat too long cause they were on the hard to crispy side.  The menu deserves high praise. It's comparable to what I enjoyed at Taco Guild. Despite some poor execution, I'm definitely making a return trip to try the other tacos. Just beware. These are $6 street tacos. A little pricey, but worth the money!",

The Kohi coffe stout was something I looked forward to and was disappointed.  Smooth for a 10 percent just not that tasty.  The brewery itself was cool, especially the men's stand up urinal. You will have to see it for yourself.  One gripe I had was when one of the employees came down to coral Alley's toys, even though no one but us occupied the lower level at the time.  The toys were in no one's way.  Just saying not cool it was only 4 dig treats and they were within 1 foot of us.",

The bartender was very welcoming and kind. She suggested a few beers for me and gave me a little background on some of the beers.   I ended up with the American IPA. It was perfect. Not too red, not too malty; just the perfect amount of hoppy and fresh. My only suggestion would be to chill the glasses. In this sweltering heat the beers get warm pretty quickly. That may just be me though...I nurse my beers.   UPDATE: I've been back a few times now and their beers are noticeably cooler!   I can't wait to come back here and try their food. It's light Mexican style bar food. I saw a few vegetarian options on the menu that I will be back to test out.   There was a waitress that was so sweet and kind, I exchanged a few words with her and she made my day. They left an impression that will certainly lead me back through the doors!",

Although the restaurant was understaffed and food took an extremely long time, fortunately for us, our beers and drinks didn't take too long and we had a large group we had a good time. Their Sonoran Brat was absolutely fantastic and probably the best best I've had. It came out nice and hot and had that bbq smell and taste to it. Truly authentic. Overall had a good time, but just lacked employees which caused extremely long delays on getting our food. Like I've an hour. Felt bad for the 1 server that had to serve the entire restaurant at no fault of her own and we did give a healthy tip to her because although she was struggling being by herself she was pleasant and did the best she could with the cards she got dealt.  Overall the restaurant ambience great, very large and open./inviting.   A little further for us to go here regularly but a good place to check out and try. All their food had compliments from our friends which was great to hear.",

I went on a weeknight and it was packed . They had a few bands playing also . The chicharrones and cactus dip was perfect. Great start ! The coffee rub tri tip tacos were also fantastic.

We ordered a blonde with the chicken tacos and then a coffee stout with the steak tacos. Choked down on those and decided to try the bananas cornbread someone was raving about. I'll shamelessly admit we ordered another after the first order because they were THAT GOOD. I'd like to give the stout all the credit for me kicking my husband's butt in shuffleboard.

The location definitely was not ideal as it is in a \"rougher\" area and upon passing by, the place looked closed. We decided to give it a try. We walked in and there were a few couples which was kind of surprising, being a Saturday night. The atmosphere was calmer and quiet, something most breweries are not. The restaurant was also very clean. We were greeted and chose a table. The restaurant has PLENTY of seating, despite being seemingly vacant. There are some games you can play while eating for your food. We ordered the flight of beers and later saw the \"Blue Line Blonde\". Being in law enforcement myself, this was awesome. We shared the nachos, which were simple--but not bland. We also shared the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger--this was enough for two people! Although this place was hidden away, it sure emphasizes \"don't judge a book by its cover\".",

All are excellent but it's been the same limited menu for some time now. It's getting a bit boring. The reason for the 2 stars is the music. Not only was it loud (we asked if they could turn it down but they said no) but it was obnoxious rap/hip hop with foul language. Really??!!!

But the beer selection needs some direction.   1 IPA... I'm all for having a good selection of beers, but a brewery better cater to beer palates and let's be honest, that's mostly IPAs. They need to start producing beers that will draw the beer crowd and the rest will follow if it's good stuff. Give me a Double (or gasp! a Triple) IPA along with all of the specialty stuff that I normally throw out of my beer sampler pack.  Get a signature beer and grow from there. Great food though. Also a bit over priced for 39th and Thomas.",

The place is large but even upon entering it has an atmosphere of being cold and impersonal. This could be because it was Sunday afternoon; not sure. Even the waiter who took our order despite being efficient just seemed like he'd would have preferred to be elsewhere. I had the Robust Porter which was far from robust, it was light and not very flavorful. We ordered 2 appetizers; the beef skewers which were tasty and the chicharrones, which rate 5 stars, were great and could easily be addictive but not good enough that we need to return.",

Well balanced beers that meet good specific gravity points that give them a well rounded body and leave great lacing on the glass when done.  The chef has produced a great menu with awesome tacos, the spent grain handmade tortillas are wonderful. The chorizo is maybe the best I have had, the banana cornbread almost made me ask for the whole pan and the pork grinds, well, WOW!  Awesome place!",

From pomegranate and pineapple chunks on my tacos, to the side of pickled grapes.  The only suggestion I have is in terms of ambiance. Their lighting sucks!

    "text": "A diamond in a rough (area!) The outside isn't much, but do yourself the favor of going inside.   Breweries seem to be popping up weekly and they are the next foodie revolution in Phoenix. Tired of LGO or Postinos or Sam Fox's psuedo local faire, hit a brewery! Sadly most are just so-so and you end up with a $50 bill and a total \"meh\" feeling.   Helio Basin is a refreshing break from that rut. The beers are delicious and different. The blackberry wheat is just awesome - subtle flavors and great finish.  The menu is unique and the chef's combinations puzzling but delicious. Grapes in the guac - a nose wrinkler at first, but once you try you're a fan! The chips that go with it are a pleasant change from boring old tortilla chips.  The corn bread ... it defies words. A must must have!  The tacos ... big enough to split, albeit it a tad messy to cut. If you do the guac and cornbread then one whole taco is probably enough. If you go with a friend, get two and split.  I'd have to say the flavor profile on the tacos was superior to Taco Guild.   Costs - put this as mildly expensive. 2 people with guac, cornbread, 2 tacos and 3 beers was $50 with tip.   The staff was stellar and added to the experience. The manager was friendly and welcoming and even our waitress had a great knowledge of both the beers and the menu. A nice change from what can sound like a tedious repeat of expensive items to boost sales/tip.  Lastly, there are plans to expand a patio area and improve the exterior. Hopefully it'll be dog friendly.   Well done, Helio Basin! I wished I lived closer, but I will add you to my list for visits to this area.",

    "text": "What if I told you that one of the top chefs in the entire state of Arizona is hiding out at a Phoenix microbrewery?  If the name Tamara Stanger doesn't yet fit into your gastronomic lexicon, then file that name away for future use.  Why?  Because Tamara is already kicking ass and taking names at virtually every food festival she enters.  The Tacolandia festival?  First place.  The Roosevelt Row Pie Social?  First Place.  The Scottsdale Culinary Festival?  First place.  The Devour Culinary Classic (the Super Bowl of AZ culinary events)?  Yup, first place.  My only question is how has Helio kept her around this whole time?  To co-owners Mike Conley and Dustin Hazer, my advice is pay that woman whatever she wants.  I count myself lucky to have sampled some of Tamara's creations at these culinary festivals.  From coffee and beer infused tacos, to a hibiscus vinegar pie, to her Devour crown jewel: braised bison taquitos.  Yet despite all of this, I've been to Helio a couple of times for brews but have never had a meal here.  That changes right here, right now.  You'll find Helio Basin Brewing slightly hidden in a Walmart shopping center on the southwest corner of 40th Street and Thomas.  Its next door to the Mattress Firm and around the corner from Peter Piper Pizza.  The inside is somewhat spartan but with plenty of seating for at least 100 patrons and the main bar front and center serving up Helio's in house brews.  As I said, I've been here for beer before and they make some great ones.  In addition to some seasonal and special batches, their everyday brews like their American IPA, Hoppy Amber, and 602 Brew are great options.  They also have arguably the best flight boards in town (wood cutout boards of the state of Arizona so awesome they look like they came from an Etsy or Pinterest catalog).  But I knew all that when I arrived today.  My main mission was to sample chef Tamara's everyday menu for the first time.  I started with their Seared Banana Cornbread.  The cornbread comes with a side of their cracked pepper honey butter.  For those of you like me who are easily addicted to Texas Roadhouse' dinner rolls, eating Helio's cornbread is just like that.  The bread was perfectly soft inside with a firm and slightly crunchy exterior and I could've eaten that honey butter by the spoon full.  Great notes of tempered sweetness to wake up your palette.  When it comes to the rest of their menu, I should note that most of the dishes here are on the spicy end.  Its understandable as spicy food often pairs well with good beer and those spices can impart great flavor, but I had little trepidation as I'm usually a wimp with spicy food.  But one dish that I just had to try was their Smoked Rabbit Pasta (yes, rabbit).  Linguine pasta mixed with slightly spicy tomatillos, house made rabbit sausage, locally sourced olives, capers, anchovies, pine nuts, cheese, and herbs with two warm house made tortillas on the side.  Oh and a farm fresh egg on top if you dare (and of course I did).  If there was ever a dish that encapsulates the full range of Tamara's talent, this is it.  A battalion of great flavors, textures, and mixtures of meat and non meat ingredients.  The rabbit sausage is admittedly a leaner and gamier sausage than I've had before, but the noodles were perfect and the anchovies gave the pasta an extra briny note that worked beautifully to balance out the cheese.  Hell even the house made tortillas were amazing.  An absolute grand slam of a dish on every front.  After finishing dinner, I (briefly) debated whether I had enough room to try out a dessert item.  Then I saw the first item on the dessert menu.  Caramel Cheesecake Chimichangas.  Cheesecake in chimichanga form and covered in beer infused caramel and salted popcorn.  Total time elapsed between waffling and ordering?  About 5 seconds.  Two chimis come in total.  The crust cuts easily with a fork and inside is warm melty cheesecake.  Mix in that caramel and popcorn in each bite and you've got a delicious sweet and salty conclusion to an outstanding meal.  Total cost for the food, a pair of 5 ounce beer samples (because one must at a microbrewery), tax, and tip came to about $50.  Just FYI, the rabbit pasta w/egg is one of the most expensive items on the menu at $22 so that's what drove up the price for me (and was totally worth it).  Almost all of the rest of their food menu items are less than $15 each.  So lest there be any doubt that Tamara Stanger and the brewmasters at Helio Basin are putting in just as much hard work as well as good food and beverage in front of their everyday customers in addition to the festival circuit.  If you're a beer fan, you'll love Helio.  If you're a food lover, you'll love Helio even more.  Which is why Hello is hands down my favorite microbrewery in the valley.  And why you'll want to keep a close eye on Tamara, a fantastically talented woman finding new ways to make you say wow with each and every dish.",

We came late on a Wednesday evening and indulged in some delicious beer and grub. I had the blackberry wheat and it was AMAZING. I am a big fan of Abita Purple Haze and this seriously rivals it, if not better. It wasn't sweet at all but had the perfect hint of blackberry.  For food, we had the sopressata chips to start and they were literally incredible. They bake the meat into the perfect crispy chip form and cover it with sesame seeds. It was nice and salty and a perfect compliment to the beers. For my entree, I got the Sonoran dog because duh. It was delicious as well! It was so big that my husband had to help me finish it! For something sweet, we tasted a tiny scoop of their homemade bubblegum ice cream paired with their 602 Brew. We will absolutely be back for the ice cream flight!! YUM!   I love that they source their food ingredients from local farms and the menu is very unique. Don't expect to come here and get a burger and wings, Helio is unique and they definitely do it right! We'll be back soon!",

    "text": "Hello Basin Brewing offers CRAFT BEERS and CHEF CRAFTED Arizonian Influenced FINE BAR FOODS.  When you walk in you know your in a Brewery for sure. There's a big bar surrounded by some high tops and take a few steps down and there's a big space filled with a fermentation room with great big vats for brewing. There's bunches of kegs and single tables and community tables.  I ordered the Trout Tacos. I got three street sized tacos on Spent Grain (by product from beer) tortillas. The tacos were filled with rich firm smoky trout, pickled fresno peppers, creamy deviled egg mousse, capers and baby greens. I really enjoyed the nutty taste of the spent grain tortillas and I thought the smoked trout and fresno peppers were an excellent pairing. For me it was impossible to taste the deviled egg mousse because my mouth was filled with smoke so the egg was just something creamy inside.  My husband tried the Sonoran Dog. This sandwich was painstakingly detailed. It was a spicy house made brat, smoked bacon, duck fat beans, stewed nopales, pickled fresnos and onions, picco de gallo, ancient mustard, jalapeno pesto, cotija cheese, crema on a bolillo roll. Now this sandwich had A LOT GOING on. It was an outstanding sandwich.  We were served by the bartender. He was the only working out front when we were there. He was efficient.  4-5 stars depending on what you order.",

I would have liked to pick from the entire menu, as we knew going in that we weren't going to like all of the ones from their core list (we're not big on IPAs or stouts, so it was unfortunate we had to go with those).   Other than that, this place is a good spot. There were quite a few people there, but because the layout is big and spread out, it didn't feel that way. They had cornhole and some board games to play too, which is always fun! They also have a lot of cool merchandise available :)",

Not a knock, just my personal opinion. With that said, if anyone  ordered me any of the beers I would be more than happy to drink it.   Tacos- on point. I had the steak, rabbit sausage and the chorizo. This place might have the best gastropub tacos. Egg on top of the chorizo was downright impressive.",

We decided to go very an early dinner here on New Years Eve.  We were pleasantly surprised with everything.  We started with the cornbread with honey butter with cracked pepper... to die for!  We then ordered four different tortillas from their menu... all very unique.  I found them all delicious, but my favorite was the Yucatecan banana leaf roasted pork.  Wish we could have tried them all.  We will go back for sure and will bring",

The star of the food menu, in my opinion, is the Crispy Brussel Sprouts appetizer. The sauce is a mix of honey and sriracha. They are addicting! I wanted the whole plate to myself.  I'll be back soon to try more. I hear Tuesdays they serve Tacos as well. YUM!",

We tasted a few, and my favorite was definitely the House Chorizo (comes with a sunny side egg on top...super yummy!).  If you like beer, and you like tacos, definitely come check this place out!",

The interior decor is pretty basic.  The have a bar that sits about 20 people with two televisions and plenty of tables for parties of four or more.  The brewing area is very visible and it's fun to see them actually brew the beer.  They have six core beers and a couple of seasonals.  I've tried their IPA and pale ale. Both were just OK.  Yesterday I was here for taco Tuesday.  For $10 you get two tacos and a pint of one of their six core beers.  That is a great deal!    The two tacos (they call them tortillas) are made from the spent grain from the brewing process.  All of the variations listed on the menu looked good and I went with a pork belly taco and a skirt steak taco.  Both of these were incredibly delicious and flavorful.  In fact, they may well be the best food I've had at any brewery.  Make sure to give Helio Basin a try.  They are a great option if you are in that part of town.",

    "text": "If you're looking for layers of flavors in your food, from everything from the starter, to the entree, to dessert, to you drinks, check out Helio Basin.  We went to Helio brewery one day on a recommendation from a coworker, and definitely don't regret it. We decided to try the Chickpea Tostado to start and share the Coffee-Rubbed Trip Tip Tacos .  The Chickpea Tostada came out and I said aloud, \"These ingredients just make sense!\" Do you know that feeling when a chef just whips ingredients together and is hoping it all come together, but it just doesn't? NOT the case with the Chickpea Tostada. The ingredients include a heaping of chickpea puree, crunchy onions, delicious prickly pear grapes, and it's all topped off with purple kale. The flavors come together in a symphony of yumminess.  Next came the tacos, the tacos also had a distinct flavor profile where the flavors just came together. I think I'm noticing a pattern...The meat itself was seasoned well on its own, but coupled with the balsamic mushrooms and jalepenos, the taste was just amplified by the complimentary ingredients. It was also so much fun trying out all the five different flavors of hot sauces with the tacos, and I personally loved the honey habernero.  Finally, and this was absolutely my favorite part, we tasted an ice cream and beer pairing. Each pair had its own unique identity. The Mexican Lime with the American Pale Ale, was tart and flirty. The Pistachio, Date, & Black Pepper was creamy and smooth with the Robust Porter. There was the Blueberry and Chocolate Chip that magnified the Blackberry Ale and the IPA that magnified the Mesquite Cherry ice cream. And c'mon, where else are you going to find a beer and ice cream pairing in the Valley? That's like my two favorite things in the world.  Overall, this was a food experience for the books. Definitely check Helio Basin out if you're ready to have your taste buds blown.",

While most brewpub menus are glorified sports bar cuisine, Chef Tamara writes a menu that is pure culinary poetry!  In addition to the regular weekday menu of tacos and small plates, on Fridays and Saturdays she does full-blown entrees that are nothing short of works of art.  Foie gras creme brulee!  Lamb belly with blood orange marmalade! Trust me on this, I am a foodie who was in the F&B biz for 30 years, and I was simply  BLOWN AWAY!  Do yourself a  favor and get over here!",

The beer is yummy, especially the Blackberry Wheat and my husband said the Robust Porter was the best Porter he has ever had.    But let's discuss the food.  The tacos were not only the best tacos I have ever had, they were quite possibly the best meal I have ever had.  Do NOT leave this place without trying the Pork Belly tacos.  Also the chicken and goat cheese was to die for.  Apparently their cornbread is amazing so we are going to have to go back again before we leave.  Not too far from the airport so that will make it easy for us to grab our last meal before we catch our flight home.  The best part, though, was the amazingly friendly people, from the gal who greeted us at the door, our waitress, and the manager, who all stopped by to say hello.   It was 7:30 at night and the brewer (owner?) was hosing down the floors for the night in their spotless brewery.  Truly a labor of love.    DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE BY!!!!",

I moved from Phoenix to the Bay Area 8 months ago and in the mean time all these great new places pop up just in time for me to engorge myself with great food and brews for the holidays. Being from the Bay Area now, I'll put my taste above the average person. Helio Basin is about to be one of those places I have to visit every time I'm in town now. I split a beer and ice cream (yes you heard it right, ice cream with a bonus sugar cookie on the bottom) tasting with a friend and everything was absolutely amazing. Didn't have a single flavor I didn't like and I'm usually pretty picky about my beers. To top it off, the ice cream is made from scratch by them so you know you're getting a good pairing and those interesting flavors you're not going to find anywhere else. Also, do yourself a favor and get the chicharrones, they're out of this world. The staff is incredibly nice as well and the prices can't be beat.  Make sure you stop by here if you're ever looking for great craft beer and maybe even a meal to go alongside it.",

    "text": "I've been extolling the virtues of the food and atmosphere at Helio Basin since I first ventured into the place nearly a year ago, calling it the best and most innovative Mexican food in town. Unfortunately, something has changed and it disappoints me very much.   First, the service model has changed, and not for the better. Last night when we came into the restaurant, instead of sitting at a table and being cheerfully greeted by a server, Now you queue up in a line at the bar, quickly peruse a menu, place your order with the person at the bar and then pay in advance. You then get your beer handed to you and a number to take to a table and wait for a food runner to bring your food. If you want water, it's now self-service at a water station --- no ice, just cold water. If this sounds like being in a fast food joint, you're right. Once you get the food delivered to you, there's no further interaction with anyone from the staff. What used to be warm, friendly service has turned impersonal.   Second, regarding the food, what was a small but really creative menu has now become a smaller, very limited menu. There used to be eight different taco offerings (called tortillas), but now there are five. The War Bonnet Carnitas, which was life-changing good, is now gone from the menu.No more coffee-rubbed skirt steak either. We tried ordering the fantastic guacamole (served with those wonderful chips made from spent grain), but were told that they weren't serving it any longer. Huh? Because we were standing in a line and didn't have the time to completely peruse the menu, there may be other dishes missing from the menu but that I just didn't notice.  I fear that corners are being cut and that quality may begin to slip. The chorizo tortilla no longer had the fried egg on it, which was a very nice touch as the runny yolk would blend nicely with the very flavorful chorizo. Not only is the egg gone, but they are using a different chorizo that feels like someone went to the store and bought a package of Johnsonville sausages to chop up.   I've told so many people, friends and strangers alike, about Helio Basin, but now I feel the need to call them all back to say the place has changed. I hope that this is just a temporary blip. It used to be a friendly place with a good homey vibe and killer food, but it sure wasn't on this most recent visit. I'm hoping that the owners can get it back to where it used to be. It's not close to my neighborhood but in the past it was worth the out-of-the-way drive ---- I guess I'll just stick to the brewpubs in my neighborhood.",

The atmosphere was okay...the lights were a little too bright and the space too wide open for our tastes, but I'm sure when the weather is warmer and those roll up doors are open, it would probably be pretty cool in there. But the service was great and very friendly. The beer was really good. I had the Blackberry Wheat and hubby had the Robust Porter and then the Kohi Imperial Coffee Stout. He's more of a hop head, but he liked those both very much and I really liked my choice.  DO order the Banana Seared Cornbread with honey butter with cracked black pepper- delicious and addicting! Hubby got the the Chorizo Taco with and egg on top which he loved. We also shared the Beer Beef Sticks rolled in jalapenos..very tasty...especially with their homemade Serrano and ghost pepper hot sauces! They also make their own homemade ice cream. They have one called Pistachio, Date and Black Pepper that was the total bomb! The flavors go awesome together and we loved it! The place is a bit of a hike for us but we will definitely go back!",

We walked in and were surprised how open it was compared to how small it looks on the outside. Let's cut straight to the food: we ordered their beer cheese nachos (reason we went there) which were absolutely amazing. Had an amazing queso-esq sauce to it, covered with carne Asada, and plenty of other delicious toppings (see pictures). We also split the barbecue bacon burger, i don't think any words can describe just how perfect this was. Kind of a, you-have -to-try-it-out for yourself kinda of situation. Highly recommend for food, oh they have beer, can't go with good food and beer my friends.",

Let's see is this a brew pub that serves awesome beers or a Gastro pub that serves beers along side with 5 star chef farm to table type fare?    I was welcomed immediately at the bar, Justin?, I explained I was a 1st timer and described my beer preferences. He patiently explained the options and pointed me to their new release IPA.  There new release sassion IPA is a beer that you can drink all day 12 months a year. The all American IPA is also awesome. It's a complex IPA but enjoyable for even the non-IPA drinker. I sampled a few other beers and you can't go wrong.  After a few libations it was time to eat. After reading all the great reviews I knew I could not go wrong. The tri-tip tacos were recommended. Holy moly I am still dreaming of these tacos. Picture three small homemade corn tortillas (just like little grandma used to make) stuffed with perfectly marinated beef, spicy sauce, sweet onion, mushrooms, and topped with a fresh jalapeno slice.  Oh pick a sauce mild, med, maple syrupy, or 7 out of 10 hot. The 7 out of 10 got me hooked. It's one of those hey this isn't bad then it hits you!  Yea, Helio is going right into the brewpub rotation.",

Had the beer sampler and Bacon burger with truffle fries. But wait! We started off with the seared banana cornbread. Wholly crap!! Amazing amazing!! Hard to beat. However the buns made with the pale ale and truffle fries were fire! Absolutely delicious!!! My guest had the ceviche/shrimp something and that was bomb as well.

Everything was also very reasonably priced and they had a fantastic happy hour from 4-7 Tues-Friday.  They also serve food, which looked great, but I did not get the chance to try any of it.

Taco Tuesday is awesome!  Great bullgogi tacos with fantastic flavor and they include a beer in your order.  I had the blackberry blonde and it was a very well balanced beer with just the right amount of fruit flavor.  Soft and sweet and refreshingly tart with a nice nose and clean body.  I also had the truffle fries which I couldn't stop eating!  Today it is burger day.  WOW the BBQ Bacon burger was enormous and perfectly cooked.  It honesty left nothing to be desired.  Went with the salad with the jalapeno ranch and it was very good but wish I would have ordered the fries.   Paired with the burger was the 602 brew.  Clean crisp low IBU beer with a light body that was refreshing and crisp.   Service is excellent at the bar.  I can't believe this place isn't completely packed.  With the quality beer and value for menu on their excellent food menu.",

On my most recent visit we had the banana cornbread (to die for); the chicharonnes (excellent); and I had the chickpea tostada (amazing). On previous visits I had some of their taco plates and they are worth every bite.   Their beer has much to be desired although I had the session ipa this time and it was great with the strong flavors of the food. Their beer tastes better in their beer and ice cream pairings, but standalone - i would rate their beer 3 stars. Certainly not bad but there is better beer being made in the Valley (AZ wilderness and wren house, for example).   10/10 would recommend.",

    "text": "This place is such a great addition to the local brewpub scene in and around Phoenix. The beers are amazing here and are definitely some of the smoothest and easiest drinking brews I've ever had. The Amber was the most interesting and unique beer I've had in a long time and everyone else that was trying it was saying the same.  I've had two visits so far and tried the majority of their food, all of which was far from your typical pub grub and absolutely delicious. The tepary bean puree is very hummus like and pairs well with the pickled vegetables. The green olive guacamole is definitely one of my favorites and the spent grain tortilla chips are the perfect vessel for it. Their banana cornbread is simply addicting. All of the tacos I've had are bursting with flavor and a very welcome change to the typical bar food lineup, and the best part is the spent grain tortillas actually hold the tacos together until you finish. Did I mention that they locally source their food?  The staff is friendly and helpful and make each visit a delight. Always looking forward to my next visit.  P.S. - When you travel to this gem, which you know you should, look for the sign that says \"BREWING CO\"",

We hope the place works out, because it's a cool concept in that part of town.

It's spacious, low lighting (instead of the bright fluorescent you see at most breweries), high tops, low tops, couches, and board games. We had a limit on time based on baby girls tolerance and we didn't want to annoy other guests, so we ordered pretty quick. I had the American IPA and wife ordered the blackberry blonde. My IPA was hoppy without being aggressive and overbearing. It was no palate wrecker, that's for sure and very quaffable. Hers was refreshing without being overly fruity.   Our nachos were great. I don't say that often. They don't overflow them with moist toppings, so the chips stay crispy, and we crushed them. For mains, we both got the burger - she got the regular, i went for the Impossible. Both cooked well and tasty! Midway through, baby girl broke down a bit, and the staff was so lovely and came by and were very sweet.   We wanted to leave before full on meltdown occurred, but before leaving, the staff gave us a little goodbye gift, knowing we won't be out much.   Little do they know, we will back a lot, and so will baby girl. I want to try the Fayuca IPA next!!",

They been on my to-drink list for awhile (as I'm actually stopping by the brewery for some cold ones). I contacted them recently about hosting my Meetup group for a Sunday Funday to imbibe in beer and maybe get a tour for anyone interested.   While the tour wasn't much of a tour (Mike, one of the owners let us know his brewmaster counterpart is an insane sanitary stickler), it still was quite informative and delicious! When we arrived, Mike was there to greet us with a smile and a handshake. Him and his beertender quickly got us all taken care of with a pint/food orders and took us to the back to chat about their operations. They've been around for about 3 years after having been chatting about setting up a brewery for ~10 years- these guys know what they're doing!   They have about 6 mainstay beers on tap and a handful of seasonals/specials. If you order a flight, you'll get the mainstays. I'm not an Amber or Brown beer fan whatsoever so Mike was kind to let me switch it out for their seasonal Black IPA. The best of the flight - the Black IPA, the Blackberry Blonde & the American IPA. If you need a food indulgence, go for the cake, made with their porter beer.",

I usually drink IPAs and like all kinds (double, hazy, etc.) I wasn't very impressed with either of their IPAs here. They weren't terrible or anything, but not memorable.   The food menu was much smaller than we had thought based on the other yelp reviews, but we all ordered food and it was good. It seems like they have taken quite a few items off their menu.",

The tacos this week were bison chorizo and fish tacos and the size of the tacos were a lot smaller than they looked in other yelp photos. I would rate the tacos 3/5 because both tacos were not as flavorful as expected.   I was very impressed with the moo point chocolate milk stout! It was delicious and really tasted like smooth chocolate milk! I would totally get it again!  Tip: During happy hour (m-f from 3-7) you get $2 off seasonal beers, and core beers are $3.75.   There is a large game/ lounge area to the right of the brewery that has a foosball table and a ping pong table. It was completely empty when we came, but looks like a great hangout spot if it was busier.",

Taco Tuesday is awesome!  Great bullgogi tacos with fantastic flavor and they include a beer in your order.  I had the blackberry blonde and it was a very well balanced beer with just the right amount of fruit flavor.  Soft and sweet and refreshingly tart with a nice nose and clean body.  I also had the truffle fries which I couldn't stop eating!  Today it is burger day.  WOW the BBQ Bacon burger was enormous and perfectly cooked.  It honesty left nothing to be desired.  Went with the salad with the jalapeno ranch and it was very good but wish I would have ordered the fries.   Paired with the burger was the 602 brew.  Clean crisp low IBU beer with a light body that was refreshing and crisp.   Service is excellent at the bar.  I can't believe this place isn't completely packed.  With the quality beer and value for menu on their excellent food menu.",

My not so favorite part, I hate to do this.. the food was bland in my opinion. :| we saved our appetite specifically for this place and even with that both of our meals were nothing to write home about.

Everything was perfectly made and beautifully presented. I'm not much of a beer drinker, my husband is, yet I loved the beer we ordered. The staff was friendly and helpful. Try the hot sauces if you get the chicken verde tacos any of the sauces make the tacos even better. Before we left they told us about their deserts we tried the vinegar grapefruit pie. It was the most unique and delicious flavored pie ever! Try it!",

The place is really barren, slightly sterile look to it, but I'm guessing it's because they've only been open for such a short period of time. Place is really large, probably good for large groups.   The beer: they have a limited selection right now, but hopefully they'll expand. I really liked the blueberry wheat. Their sampler tray is super cute and a great way to try their beers.  The food: Great tortilla plates! You can either get one taco for $6 or two of the same for $11. I highly suggest bringing a friend and splitting the tacos, they're unbelievably tasty! The veggie one was really good as well as was the taco with avocado hummus.",

The owner is very friendly, outgoing, and knowledgeable about the industry & craft. Additionally, the food was fantastic and unique. The guacamole is incredible. I've never had guacamole with grapes in it but after trying it I am a believer. Unique yet very, very tasty.  Another great menu item is the corn bread. I could eat an entire meal of it, and I imagine it pairs really well with the wide variety of freshly brewed beers on tap.  Bottom line: Will definitely be returning to taste some of the beers, and I'm excited to try more of the menu!",

My first trip to Helio was no doubt a five star experience. It was kind of quiet for a Saturday night (around 9pm) but for the most part, I am cool with a calm vibe and good conversation. The bartenders were very friendly and told us a little bit about the place and the current beer selection. I tried each of the seasonals (Blue Line Blonde- good, Monarch Belgian Blond- better, and Summa Crusha- best.) When I go back I would definitley have to do a flight of the standards. A few other things I need to try next time at Helio- the food (already ate!) and the shuffleboard table (too lazy this time.) I do really like the laid back, spacious, brewery atmosphere here. It seems like a good spot for bigger groups. Very non descript place from the outside, but well worth a trip inside. Be back soon!",

Compare food to OHSO 1.5 miles away.  For same relative price it was fantastic versus OK.  Beer was exceptional.  I ordered flight of beers because I wanted to sample.  All we're good .  Favs were Amber and Amer IPA.  I'll be back.  Hope it stays Thomas Rd just tougher for a brewery than Indian School or Camelback!",

And that's really the only example I feel like coming up with right now, but I think that's all you need to get the point, which is that Helio Basin is elevating the oftentimes dry and tasteless Sonoran desert to a whole new level of deliciousness.  So instead of trying to suck the juice out of a barrel cactus or bite a hunk out of a prickly pear, how about you slake your vicious desert thirst with some blackberry wheat beer and fill your rumbling tummy with a sprawling collection of crazy good tacos. Seriously, the tacos (tortillas) here are spot on.  Oh and one more thing - CORNBREAD. I'm not going to say it's life-changing, but...it's pretty close. So go and see for yourself how amazing this place is.",

    "text": "I wanted to try this place because it has excellent reviews and was mentioned in Phoenix Magazine. I'm glad we did try it, but it's also one we won't come back to.  I came with my mom and sister and we started with a glass of wine for my mom, which she enjoyed and my sister and I split a flight. She thought all the beers tasted the same so she wasn't much of a fan. I liked the flight board shaped like the state of AZ and the berry beer had a touch of fruit flavoring that I enjoyed. We got the cornbread appetizer for an appetizer and it was very good and the flavored butter was fantastic. There wasn't much of it though, which was a disappointment because it was $6, and for what we got it should've been more like $3 or $4.  The overpriced theme continued for the rest of the meal. It was all good, but the entrees are all about $5-$6 overpriced. We got 3 different things since it is a VERY limited menu.  I'm talking like 4-5 appetizers and the same for entrees. We ordered the tri-tip tacos, the Sonoran dog and the tostada.  Again, the were all good-not fantastic, just good and beautifully plated.  Our server was excellent. He was the only one there, so he manned the bar, took orders, delivered food and beer to tables, and delivered the bill and was cashier. He did a great job, although there were only a couple people seated at the bar and 4 other tables.  We ended with dessert because who can resist an ice cream flights, especially with fun flavors such as blueberry and chocolate chip and Mexican lime. You can get 4 \"scoops\" on a crunch cinnamon and sugar flat tostado/crispy flat sopapilla type thing for $6 or pair that with 4 flights of beer for $12.   Now the 4 ice creams we tried were all delicious, but I say \"scoops\" lightly because they were scoops more fitting to Tinkerbell or Thumbalina, rather than normal-sized human beings. Again, it was good, but overpriced.  So all in all, I am glad we tried it. It has potential and there is good space inside and it's nice and open, but they need to tweak some stuff-including the menu and pricing and this place will have a better chance of surviving another year in the valley's booming Brewery scene.",

It manages to be an absolutely amazing and authentic experience that stand out to me vs. all the other breweries that have popped up in Phoenix the past few years.   I had the Sonoran dog, which hit the spot perfectly. The beer was great, with awesome seasonal selections to put you into the Fall mood. The highlight by far was the \"Beer and homemade ice cream flight\". Holy crap, what an awesome idea - spoonful of ice cream with a sip of beer. Surprising match made in heaven.

After moving from San Diego it was one of the things I missed most. This place has all the potential of making it big. They have really great food ( albeit a tad pricey food imo) but their star is the IPA. Really enjoyable, and my favorite out of the flight we had ordered. The food was also, really good. Out of the skewers, and the tortillas-yucatecan banana leaf pork belly taco we had, I think I enjoyed the most simple chicharones with my beer. They are sweet and salty pork rinds, which really are the perfect finger food while enjoying crispy beers on a 100 degree day. I also have to give a shout out to the pineapple jicama salsa- so refreshing with my taco in the summer!!  Definitely worth a visit!",

    "text": "We sat at the bar and tried a flight of 5 beers, and each had something interesting. My favorite was the amber, and I typically do not prefer ambers. The food was out of this world. I really love a place that has menu options besides the standard burgers, pizza, wings, etc, and this offered that and more. Sure, the entrees are tacos, but the options of types of tacos you can get are like nothing you will find elsewhere. The chef has put together some very creative combinations.   We tried both fry bread appetizers. One had a white tepary bean puree and pickled vegetables and grapes on top which were to die for. The other was topped with romaine and tomatoes with a bowl of saffron chili beans and a side of cucumber habanero relish to put on top.   For tacos, we tried the yucatecan banana leaf roasted pork with pineapple jicama pico and crispy fried onion which was amazing, all of the flavors complimented each other perfectly. Also tried the beer-braised pork belly, pistachio and pine nut mole, roasted corn, cotija and cilantro which I liked, however pork belly is generally too chewy for me. That's just my personal preference though. We also had the mesquite honey chicken, apricot apricot pepper compote, spicy goat cheese, and micro epazote, which may have been my favorite. The last one was spicy coffee rubbed skirt steak, red quinoa, avocado mousse, and sundried tomatillos.   We also got a side of the smoked duckfat charro beans which were scrumptious.  Our bartender was Mitch and he was a lot of fun. I also liked a lot of the small touches such as the plateware used and the decor in the bathroom. The prices were also affordable, not anything too high like I would have expected when seeing this kind of menu in advance. Mitch says the chef keeps adding new menu items so I look forward to coming back and checking them out. There should also be additions to their 5 main beers coming in the future. I highly recommend giving it a try and don't go without trying the food.",

First Wren House opened a year ago and has been my go-to on a weekly basis ever since, then we got Helton opening just a month or so ago and adding solid beers with cheesy goodness to the scene and now there is Helio Basin! And bonus - I can walk here, when its not 1009903 degrees out! Hope they're ready for their first regular!   Walking in, I'm expecting the typical growing pains of a newly-opened business but there is none of that - they're clean, fully staffed, 6 beers on tap and kitchen full of goodness ready to serve me. The bartender was a familiar face from AZWBC and hooked me up with a flight so I could sample everything. There are breweries open for over a year now (looking at you, west side) that still have off flavors, growing pains and overall disappointments when it comes to their beer lineups. Not the case here! Every beer was really spot on and True to style - even the wheat beer which I normally do not like due to their sickly sweet syrup add-ins, came out tasting like real blackberry with a welcome tartness. IPA is awesome, went back in for a pint of that one.   Then the food - my friends kept ordering Tortilla plates and apps so I certainly couldn't resist that. The plates are amazing - such wonderful fresh ingredients, perfect portioned in spent grain tortillas. I lived, breathed and died for the steak one - its spicy coffee rubbed with quinoa in one of those amazing fresh tortillas! Its incredible. My friends loved the cornbread and the frybread and bean dip too. Overall not a single complaint here.   They're already signed up and supporting the local homebrew club, ASH, as a sponsor too - just another reason to come on in and make this a favorite on your CenPho beer scene rotation! I'll probably be there when you do...:)",

If you're looking for burgers and wings go elsewhere.  We had a sample flight of 6 beers which honestly we're ALL excellent.  We really enjoyed the Shim Sippa Session IPA which was light and delicious and the Blackberry Wheat which paired perfectly with the pulled chicken chili Verde tacos with local goat cheese and maple glazed apples. Yum!  We also had the Moqueca which was amazing and chocked full of seafood.  This place is a winner.  Good food, good beer, good value, easy parking--- we'll be back.",

    "text": "Another Yelp winner!!! On this cool and calm Saturday, I ventured out to visit this highly reviewed \"Hot and New\" Yelp business. Upon seeing Pork Belly Street Tacos listed by another Yelper - I was down to chow! Being a fan of Microbreweries, I was expecting to see an atypical setup; but something was off about its location. I've been to Walmart and Dollar Tree and Onos Hawaiian a dozen and I have never seen a brewery setup there. I quickly realized upon my arrival that it was in a strip mall in the proverbial blind spot of the area, which explained why I never noticed it.  It is located on the backside of the building located (where WSS is) on the corner of 40th and Thomas. As expected I ordered what other Yelpers ordered - Blackberry Wheat beer, Seared Banana Cornbread, and Pork Belly Tacos; but I was definitely tempted to try the spicy coffee steak tacos... I may have to come back for another visit.  The Blackberry Wheat beer was not exactly my favorite of beers, but it will 'get-ya-there\". The tacos though... almost indescribable. Its like something out of the wild hallucinations of an exhausted Chef who was worn down by standarized flavors offered by the same old same old foods. The pork belly tacos were minty, spicy, and sweet. It was like my tastebuds were confused by the flavor explosion and decided to pick whatever flavor it wanted. If you dont know what to eat, eat here. The flavors of the food are uncharted territory.  Ending the meal with the cornbread was a great way to finish a satisfying meal. It was subtle, sweet, and a little crunchy.  My total came to just north of $20 just for those three things, so it is pretty expensive to eat here.  This is a must-try place!",

Tortilla plates (2 tacos each) are substantial! Female chef doing an excellent cooking and presentation of food. Very tasty tortilla plates and did not include rice with ours, but you can for additional $2. Spicy Coffee rubbed skirt steak taco, Honey mesquite chicken taco, a vegan choice of Roasted Oodham tepary bean blend, sweet potato, portabella, arugula, sweet corn and blackened tomato hummus taco all on corn tortillas. Asked for cotija cheese instead of goat cheese and received it. Fermentation cellar to take a peak at while there. Good music and did not distract from tv or conversations.",

While I will say that the blueberry ale was pretty refreshing, the remainder of the beers I tried left something to be desired -- even the IPA, which I was shocked about. The hoppy bitterness was a plenty but the malt character was lacking in my opinion, and an excellent IPA is able to balance both. I will try them again in the future, but was definitely left expecting more. Nevertheless, I will give 4 stars particularly for the blueberry ale and the attentive service.",

    "text": "I came here for a Local First promoted dinner with the brew masters. I was surprised Helio Basin is taking residence in an old pool hall I used to hang and drink cheap bad beer at. It's definitely great to see an upgrade in the beer being served at this location - lol. I had blast hearing the stories from the brew masters of how this place came about and how they make their beer. You can tell these guys know their stuff and are very passionate about serving a good beer. In fact their slogan is \"Quality Crafted in Phx\". Not only do they serve good beer, but the food is phenomenon. Chef Tamara Stanger just recently won the Devoured culinary classic excellence award for her smoked bison taquito. About thirty of us were served a four course dinner with a beer paired with each dish. Their IPA and Blackberry Wheat are the big sellers. Both were very clean, crisp and delicious. But I think the Robust Porter was my favorite. It's not too heavy and full of flavor (a nice blend of chocolate, caramel and coffee). My favorite courses were the Palo Verde Torte and the Blueberry Tamarind Pudding. Each dish was beautifully presented and had some sort of representation of Arizona in it. Hello Basin is a great addition to the Arcadia food scene and worth another stop. They have a great happy hour and I hear Taco Tuesdays is a must. Check them out!",

Do yourself a favor and get over the fact that the Blackberry Wheat beer is a \"fruit beer\" - simply phenomenal and easily an everyday beer on a hot day, just damned good. Already going back tonight to taste more of the food, get that dessert, and nab a couple more brews. Staff is super friendly and the owner's kick a truckload of ass.

A little weird to pair beer and ice cream, but a good way to try both.  The ice cream is made in house and is soooo good.  Also very different flavors and conbinations but very tasty.
