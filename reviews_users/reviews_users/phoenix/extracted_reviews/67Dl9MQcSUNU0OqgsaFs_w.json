    "text": "Hey, wait a second. Since when are pizza parlors this cool? Not only are they a sit down restaurant and delivery spot during the day, they turn into a dive bar at night. Can't say I've seen much of that! And the beers are as cheap as they get. $2 pints of Killian's Red? So awesome that my liver just flinched.  The pizza is just alright. Sweet sauces can be awesome, but only if you have the right crust and cheese to balance that out. On top of that, I know a meaty pizza can get greasy, but Pullano's is excessively so. In hindsight, the $13 for the 16\" really wasn't worth it, but maybe if you wait for some of the specials they have on Wednesday, you can sample a cheaper one for yourself. The menu is VERY expansive, too, which tells me you're pretty much gonna get more of the same as far as quality.  3 as a pizza place, but a solid 5 as a dive.",

Service was pretty slow but we weren't in a hurry. The pizza was GREAT! More like a pan pizza (thicker crust).  We had half leftover so we had dinner & lunch the next day for $6! Awesome! Their menu was huge & I noticed they had quite a few other weekly specials. Will be back next Wednesday :)",

They have since added a bar on one side, which has a nice neighborhood feel to it, and has tons of tvs to enjoy the games. Plus everything including drinks is very reasonably priced. Pullanos now has it all! Why go to some bar and pay a ton for overpriced bar food when you can come to Pullanos and get the best pizza and wings in phx!",

It's perfect for unwinding after work or school. The drinks are strong and fairly priced and the food is pretty decent too. One tip though, don't try ordering any fancy drinks. This is not the place to order a mojito or an old fashioned. Stick to the basics and you won't be disappointed!   I think the best part about Pullano's is the service. The girls who work in the bar area are nothing short of awesome. They're friendly and attentive and never leave you wondering where your server went.   Also, the restaurant is divided into two parts: a dining room area and a bar area, so whether you're looking for a family dinner or a boozy night out with friends, Pullano's has what you need. Definitely a must-try if you're in the area!",

Just like another, old and memorable submarine sandwhich shop on 35th Ave and Peoria. All these people saying your food is terrible make me laugh. 36 years is hard to come by.

I must say use extreme caution they boast about how amazing everything is and I ate the worst cheese steak sandwich in my entire life! I'm not kidding I got a sample of a microwavable cheese steak sandwich at Costco and it blows pullano's cheese steak out of the water you're better off going and buying a roll from the deli department and getting the frozen box of steakums and make it yourself. Will never return again except to pick up pizza to take home! Pullanos you better check yourself before you wreck yourself. This was my third time coming back for your lunch specials and trying something different and again disappointed you make wonderful pizza everything else throw in the garbage.",

It's a Mom and Pop shop that I've grown up with... moved away, and happened to go back recently so I can review it. :)  They are still the same as always... the same red and white checkered table covers, the placemats of Italy...   And the friggen awesome wings and pizza.  Holy crap I had forgotten how good they were... and they are now offering other flavors of wings, like Garlic and Parmesan... altho the medium flavor does fine with me. :)  The pizza... it's floppy... it's greasy... the stuff falls off, but you can't help but just want to eat more.  ESPECIALLY when you get down to the crust. Their crust is AWESOME.  Another couple of cool things... they have1.50 coors lite during races, .99 beers during happy hour, and for those of us who are used to very expensive beers... their normal price is 2.75 for beers.  Bar that is attached has all day every day $2 drafts.   Service: in the beginning it was iffy... there was no smiling from this chick.  But she seemed to relax with us as the food was delivered and things went well.  So... if you want a local place to check out some wings, pizza and beer... go here.",

Not to mention,but their ranch is so good. Since I have a family of five , they have a good deal for a extra large pizza,  and forty wings for $35. My daughter and I are the foodies of my family, and we have a very expensive taste , we aren't picky we just know what foods are good and Pullano's  is is one of our favorites.

Not sure what that means but it sounds right.  He was pretty oblivious.  We ordered enough to feed a small army and the service was super fast for how much we got.  We ordered hot wings(not hot), spicy honey bbq wings(not spicy) and garlic parm wings(ok).  The fried pickles were overcooked and the pepper jack cheese sticks were good but I was thinking they would be better.  The pizza was nothing to really remember.  The best part was the nice airy crust.  I would probably try this place again since there menu is huge.  I would just try some different entree's and apps.  Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with the pizza or wings but maybe the other food is worth talking about.",

Yes I said that right, Friday and Saturday night's from 10p - 12a it's a free pizza buffet and $1.50 drafts (used to be $1, but I'm not complaining).  They bring out 4 pizzas at a time to the buffet area and they get cleaned out pretty quickly, so make sure to take more than 1 slice at a time if you have a hearty appetite.  They're also a little slow at bringing out new pizzas, but if you plan accordingly, you can definitely get stuffed.    I haven't tried any of the other foods, and after reading the other reviews I think I will stick with $1.50 drafts and free pizza.  But the price is right, the beer is cold, and the pizza is good.  Can't go wrong here.",

    "text": "Gag. Gag and a half. Not only was the food pretty gross, the experience itself was ridiculous.   Let me just start by saying that my husband really are very laid back people. We both HATE to complain about food. Neither of us are extremely picky. I promise I am not that person that complains constantly about places.   This place came highly recommended from my boss, who is in love with their food. She talks about it all the time. My husband and I were craving some Italian, and I suggested we go here. The exterior itself looks pretty shady, but sometimes hole in the wall places end up being amazing. Not the case here.    We sit down and review the massive menu. My husband sees that they are doing $0.40 wings. He decides to do that. When the waitress comes to take our order the following stipulations were explained if he wanted to take advantage of the deal  -You can only get 1 flavor. (ok, I guess that is not that big of a deal) -You must order a soda (annoying...but whatever) -You can't leave the restaurant with them. She literally told him \"If you don't eat all your wings, we are going to throw them away. You can't take them with you.\" (Extremely annoying, petty, and wasteful) OK fine. I will get the wings and stick to your stupid rules. And then this happened:  Waitress \"Ranch or Blue Cheese?\" Husband \"Can I try one of each?\" Waitress \" well, you can only have one per order....I mean I guess I can do that for you, but I have to charge you extra for it\"  Seriously? I tried to stifle my laughter, but the entire wing conversation had been so obnoxious, it was laughable. It would be one thing if she was nice and was just trying to follow the rules, she was pretty rude.   OK so my husband gets his order of wings in, after agreeing to the \"wing laws\". I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Safe choice. Not. My meal came with soup. Meh. Nothing great. The food comes, the wings are decent. I laughed again when I saw the spaghetti.  I am not exaggerating  when I say that it was noodles, on top of tomato soup with microwaved meatballs on top. Yum! My husband looked at my plate with a \"wtf\" face. We took a picture of it because of what an amazing failure it was. My husband said \"The only time I have seen spaghetti like that is when I try to make it at home.\"    I'm pretty sure the waitress knew that it looked nasty. It was a drop and run. We didn't see her again for 20 minutes. I eventually flagged her down and sent the food back. My husband asked if I would like to share some wings with him. We order another small order of wings. They were again, just ok. I ordered the raspberry chipotle wings, they tasted like bottled BBQ sauce. Nothing amazing. When we finished our food, we waited another 15 minutes for someone to notice us. 3, yes 3 waiters walked right by us. It was obvious that we were done. Their were napkins on both plates and we were just sitting there. One waiter walked by twice.  And we still sat there. Finally our waitress came back took a couple dishes and disappeared again. They must have a freaking amazing break room or something. The best part was when I turned around to see if any employees could come rescue us, and a big group of wait staff are standing in one little spot watching the game. mmmk. cool. We'll just wait til you are done there.     So lets review, bad service, awful food, bad location, wing laws. No thanks. It would be one thing if you had amazing wings, but the wings are just average. They are neither here nor there. I would rather go to Native New Yorker's for wing night. They don't care how many ranches you want. haha  EDIT: After this was posted, I received a viscous, profanity filled response from a stranger who was apparently HUGELY insulted that I didn't like a trashy restaurant that he considers a 5 star establishment. So I share my bad experience on a website that was created to keep others in the know and I get attacked with insults and derogatory comments? So guess what Pullano's, I just dropped a star on my review. You are disgusting and so are your loyal patrons.",

(that's not True, i feed them prior to, i'm not that bad of a parent).  we agree: good for wings. we don't really eat the other food. we hear the salads are delectable. happy hour at the bar seems like a good bet also, but we really aren't happy hour sports bar kind of girls. believe it or not.",

Had the Pullano's Special (about $25) and some wings (40 for around $23).  Also had the large cheese pizzas ($12.99 w/ coupon)  Great food, energetic atmosphere, definitely a great place to grab a slice and watch a game.  We were in a party of 7 and I almost double tipped.  Didn't see that added 18% gratuity until after signing the receipt, so if you've had a few BEWARE.",

They used to deliver, but it's still worth driving over for a pick-up.  The Giant slice lunch special is awesome. The wings are fantastic and the pizza is something I craved while I was living abroad.  The owner is usually in the building, and they even provide homemade sweets during the holidays.  There is free pizza in the bar after 10pm, and it's worth it, but it goes fast. It's a small bar and it usually contains a a few rowdy people. but since it's in walking distance of my house, it's a place I love visiting.  I've only ever had a couple of things besides pizza and they were all great - but the pizza and wings are what they are known for.  With football season upon us, make sure you wear your favorite team jersey when you visit, and enjoy!",

The place was packed and of course the free pizza probably isn't their 5 star best offering, but still a great place to start your Friday night (though we have accidentally stayed til close more than once).  The service is also great, our servers have always been attentive with us never sitting there with an empty glass.  I will definitely be back!",

The reason I say this is because I had gotten a coupon in the mail for their pizza and wings which I'm sure is heavily circulated because I get them once a month usually and I figured I would call and try it. Well I drive all the way over to pick up my pizza and wings and low and behold I get there and noticed that I forget my coupon so I ask them is it okay if I get my pizza and wings this time without the coupon I live about 5 miles away and didn't want to drive all the way back just to get a coupon so the girl told me NO. I have asked for a manager and a manager had came out and I asked her the same question only to get the same answer so I left without paying for my food which would have been an extra $10 because I had forgotten the coupon the manager knows if these are heavily circulated and could have gave me a pass but chose not to so for that reason I give it one star and I will never return to this place again",

    "text": "Let's call a spade a spade; there's really not that much that separates Pullano's from any of its competition, of which there is plenty. There's a Hungry Howie's down 51st street, a Ballpark Pizza on Thunderbird, Pizza by Napoli in the opposite direction on T-bird, and a Domino's practically across the street.   They all make pizza. They all make hot wings. They will all make your intestines hate you.  What sets Pullano's apart from the others is the atmosphere. Pullano's is a fun place to be. There are giant TVs all over the place, blaring whatever sporting event is going on. The walls are covered with team paraphernalia and the occasionally offensive but amusing show of patriotism (like a picture of an F-16 with a guy on a magic carpet shopped in).  Pullano's is the perfect place to bring large groups of people. The staff  seems to even prefer the larger groups, probably because they tip better.   The menu has lots of specials that cater to large tables. Depending on the day, you can get two for one pizza deals or a large with 30 wings.   The wings are a little on the crispy side, but you never get the wimpy little \"mini wings\" that places like Buffalo Wild Wings or Domino's try to screw you with when you order large batches.   The pizza's chock full of grease, but it's filling and tastes pretty damn good. I recommend the Chicken Alfredo pizza if you ever get a chance. On Wednesdays it's two for one, last I checked.  I'm sure there's other stuff on the menu, but I wouldn't bother. It's a pizza place.   There's a reason why nobody buys tacos at Burger King.",

    "text": "Having recently moved to the neighborhood, I'm on the prowl for a new pizza place. I was looking for one that delivered, but Pullano's is close enough for pick up, and I read good things about it, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I probably should have stuck with pizza. But we were in the mood for a full, homestyle meal. We ordered a veal parmesan, a chicken parmensan, two wedding soups, and a burger for the kid.   The fact that they had burgers should have been a minor warning sign. The fact that they also have a full Mexican food menu should have been a great big honkin' neon sign.  Like most places in the Valley, Pullano's is tucked in a shabby strip mall. Inside, it's very cheery and friendly. The walls are chocked full of sports memorabilia from the local teams they support, as well as some knickknacks, and TVs airing sports. It's been around a while, and that made it rather comfortable and neighborhoody.  The staff was all smiles, and after a short wait, had my food ready to go. The price for our meal was around $30. Not bad.  Once I got it home and unwrapped it, well, yeah. The veal parm was one of those chopped and re-formed patties, dowsed in a bland tomato sauce, and topped with mozzarella. The chicken was an actual chicken breast, served in the same way, but had the texture of a dog's chew toy (not that I've actually tried one.)  On a bright note, the italian wedding soup was really rather good. In fact, we have toyed with the idea of ordering from Pullano's again -- but just soup and garlic bread. Or maybe a pizza.",

This year with the price increase, no drink specials, no swag, and no door prizes. The halftime smorg was only a salad, three types of chicken wings, half cut sandwiches, and some pasta and a gross pizza that was really greasy. The best part was the chips and dip with with the mixed nuts provided as snacks and chips and salsa. The gross part was people smoking e cigarettes at the bar. For the 50 bucks that they charged was not only outrageous for what they served, I think in my opinion it was criminal. Shame on me for going back and thinking it would be better than last year. Normally the established restaurants want to better the experience from the previous years.  I will not be going back anymore. Will be spending my cash at other reputable established places. To bad, used to go for there for years. Never again.? To bad Yelp only says 1 star is the worst you can rate.",

I now live within proximity of Manhattan and have access to really great pizza. I try to swing by Pullano's when I am back in town, and I have to say that that the pizza still holds up after all of this time. It's nothing like the New York style pizza, but it's always really good. They have a thick crust, with a house made tomato sauce (that at times can be on the sweet side). They have a tendency to overdo it with the cheese but it still comes together well. I think it's a testament to the fresh ingredients. Overall, the menu is expansive and does not disappoint.

The pizza is great (not the best in Phoenix, but authentic greasy goodness), and the wings are AWESOME (don't miss 40 cent wing night on Mondays).  As mention in another review the owner is there much of the time, he's even thrown a few bucks in the juke box and let me choose the music.

When you approach, you don't know what to expect.... It looks like a semi divey sports bar from the outside. Inside, you get the feel of a real east coast pizzeria.... You know, red checked plastic tablecloths.... Nothing fancy. We got the pizza and wings combo (which is offered everyday and saves a couple bucks from their separate prices). We got the hot wings, though they have like 20 flavors of sauce. The hot wings were some of the best in town. The chicken was perfectly fried, juicy on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside and the sauce was your typical hot wing sauce. This would be a must order. The pizza was also awesome.... Definitely not a fancy pizza.... It reminded me of Barro's a bit, because it had a puffier crust than your typical new york pizza, but it tasted better than Barro's. We had pepperoni and ricotta on the pizza, and it was sinfully tasty. This is the place to go in the west valley when you're feeling like a solid 'classic' pizza. Only downside is the price is a little high, but not terrible. Put this place on your to try list!",

The staff is friendly and they recognize us when we arrive each week which makes a difference; it shows they appreciate and value their customers. We eat their delicious food weekly!! Can't wait to return to order our next pizza. If you haven't tried Pullano's it is a must; you won't be disappointed!",

We got out check and it was $38. We then let them know that we were using a Groupon and the bartender said that she had to adjust the bill as the Groupon cannot be used for anything that was on special. She then raised our bill by $12.50. That wasn't mentioned anywhere is the Groupon terms. I guess we won't be coming back here anytime soon.",

Both sides are usually packed, friendly employees, I probably go there probably once a week.   I will tell you one thing and it's either good news or bad news: they've got a very heavy hand when it comes to the ricotta.  Got an order a baked ziti one night and for the first time I  uttered the words, \"too much cheese\", which I have never uttered before in my life. So, again good news or bad news.     Families, drunks and everything in between, they show the pay-per-view fights.   Also note:   * They have a loyalty club which can earn you free food, be sure and sign up, and,  * TUESDAY'S: 1/2 OFF -- 50% OFF -- all Italian dinners!  Go online, take a look at their menu, there is six or eight items on that Italian dinner menu and at half-off it's a great value!",

Our go to every time is the Chipotle BBQ wings.  Super Yummy.  We go at LEAST once a month and I love it there.  The staff are super nice and it always feels homey there.  I went with him to watch a Bills game this last season and I'm not even afraid to admit it was fun!!! (We stayed to watch the Giant's game lol) Pullano's will always be our go to!  Great job guys and girls!... great now I'm hungry...hmmm maybe a Pullano's trip tonight...",

We went on a Saturday night, the place was so crowded that we had to wait for a table, Don't say I didn't warn you. The pizza was truly worth it, I went boring and got a cheese pizza. It was super good. I guess I would compare it to NYPD in style. Medium thin crust, not greasy, nice and crunchy and bubbly. We started with the hot wings which were also very good. The hot is hot. Now I am kind of sad as my friend who lives around the corner moved Eastward and this will not be a regular stop. But of you're over by Cowtown Skateboards, drop in, great beer specials and a super happy crowd eating super good pizza, Staff was upbeat and peppy as well, since they have no choice, as the place is jumping!",

Second time, wings were extremely dry and the ranch was missing. This time, there was something funny about the dough. Maybe it rose too long? I don't know. But Pullanos you need to get it together.

The garlic pharm had no flavor what so bland.  The medium spice wings  were ok.  She brought celery and carrots and they looked like they were 2 weeks old.  Very dry.  Now the pizza.  We ordered the alffedo sauce.  My friend ask no mushrooms and they had put on mushrooms.  The chicken was very dry and there was no alfredo sauce.

We plan everything around going to this delicious establishment and seeing all the friendly staff. I have never had a horrible or even close to bad experience here, as the servers always make sure everything is to our liking and are always on top of our order/drinks, not to mention the amazingly delicious honey hot wings and Pullano special! In particular, we always make sure to sit in Stacey's section, as she has definitely upped our experience to make sure we feel at home and are a part of the Pullano family. However, on the days she is not there, we still know to expect a friendly welcoming, as that is the expected standard we have come to known with Pullano's. If you have not tried this place out, YOU ARE MISSING OUT! This Phoenix staple is definitely something to stick around in our Thursday tradition.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure how to rate Pullano's. I'm a little torn. My experience was better than 3 stars but not quite as good as 4.  First, the staff were all very patient and friendly. We were a large party and not sure of what we wanted. We ended up with, a small order of breadsticks, 40 wings (half medium, half BBQ), 1 XL Pepperoni, 1 XL Pepperoni with green peppers.   Breadsticks were brought out soon after our drinks. 2 pitchers of beer, a few sodas. Breadsticks were hot, soft and dripping with butter. Yum! Served with a small cup of marinara that no one touched.  Wings came shortly after. Wings were above average size cooked to mosts liking. (I prefer a super crispy wing, most in our party did not) Sauces on the wings were outstanding. The medium was a really good balance of spice and vinegar tang. BBQ was smoky and sweet. The wings came the old fashioned way with celery and carrots, a nice touch. We had a split of ranch and blue cheese. Ranch was typical, but the blue cheese was strange to me. Don't get me wrong there was nothing wrong with it but t didn't taste like blue cheese. It had a peppery taste and was a creamy color.  Pizza arrived about 5-10 minutes after. The pizza is good but...I hate to say this but it had to much cheese. Yes, too much cheese. I love cheese but the crust on the pizza could not stand up to the weight of all of that cheese. The pizza crust is crispy on the outside, soft in the inside with a slight taste of yeast. The middle of the pizza was a soggy mess after sitting only a few minutes with the cheese barely melted in the middle. I would love that crust with just a smear of sauce and a sprinkling of cheese. Would be heaven on a pizza pan.  Restaurant could use a little scrubbing, but I have to say I enjoyed my first experience at Pullano's and will definitely make another trip.   They also have a small bar attached and there were several TV's in the dining room with football games on. A good place for families.",

    "text": "8/17/2018 Well we tried Pullano's again and well what can I say.  The food was the same good food, our server was great but the hostess was one of the rudest people I have dealt with At any restaurant I have been to.  Business must be great when you can turn business away like this girl did.  Good luck!  5/13/2018 So let me say the food is still worth the price at Pullano's.  Wings are the best around!  Service is pretty good however when they are busy it definitely suffers.  But no worries.   That said we went to Pullano's last week and when we got there we noticed sitting at another table was our neighbor.  So we asked if we could sit at the table next to them and they said sure.  Sat down everyone ordered simple order pizza, wing, salad and Drinks.  Pizza was wrong however not a big deal they were good about it as were we.  When dinner was over we noticed they only brought one bill for the entire table of 6.  Instead of giving us each our own bill or even asking if we wanted separate checks.  If they would have we would have wanted separate checks but again not a big deal just think it should be our choice.  Then I noticed that they added a separate line for a gratuity of 18%.  We asked about it and were told that because we were a party of 6 there was an automatic 18% added to the bill as a surcharge.  I asked you mean in place of a tip?  She stated no the tip is extra.  I reminded her that our friends were there first and we were even seated at a different table before we noticed they were there.  There should have been two separate checks as well as jo surcharge.  She then just simply asked if she could take our bill.  Two issues here.  1.  If in fact there is going to be a surcharge for a party it should be mentioned up front, not hidden at the back of the menu.  2.  If one party joins another party they should be informed before they move that a surcharge will be added if You sit with your friends.    I checked around and I don't see a lot of surcharges being added for 6 people.  Also remember this is a Mom and Pop pizza joint not Mastros City hall.  But trying to keep it positive the food was still great.",

Total came out to 7 dollars and change for that extra topping (after tax) and I could barely get thru half!  I didn't have time to look at the bar side but the drink prices for happy hour are excellent. 99 cent domestic drafts on weekdays from 3 to 6pm. Also tons of food and drink specials on their website. I'd check this place out because it's so damn cheap, it's hard to knock it.",

    "text": "First time at Pullano's.  My husband was raving about it and has been eating there for years.  We didn't eat in, we just ordered and went and picked it up.  We got an extra large pepperoni and sausage pizza, mild wings, my daughter got the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries and tiramisu for dessert.  The pizza was awesome, one of the better pizza's I have ever had.  However, my daughter and I were disappointed with the wings.  Although, they were good size and meaty there was no wing sauce on them and they were not very crispy at all.  It was like eating a \"naked\" wing, not our favorite.  The only \"sauce\" was this thin greasy like juice sitting in the bottom of the container.    The dessert was FANTASTIC!!!!!  After seeing in the menu that the tiramisu was imported by a family member from Italy I just had to try it and I was so glad that I did!  The tiramisu comes in a decent size cup and the cost is $4.99, but it is well worth it!   Even though our experience with the wings was not to good, I am willing to try them one more time and see if maybe it was a fluke and someone overlooked putting the sauce on the wings.  Overall, the food was great and we will for sure return to Pullano's in the future!",

    "text": "Ive been here three times.. and I think I can finally make an honest review.    I don't care what pizza you've had, or what sandwich you've eaten, or what wing you've devoured.  You MUST try Pullano's.  For years my favorite NY style pizza has been NYPD Pizza (valley-wide).  Well NYPD... you've been dethroned!.   I just moved from Chandler to Glendale and happen to live about a block away from this haven.  As we all moved in to the new place, we ordered Pullano's to go.  We got three pizzas and 40 wings.  Let me tell ya.. if it weren't for the people around me, I could have eaten 24 wings by myself and the a few slices of pizza.  But damn.. i had to share.  I had one slice of the delicious meat lovers pizza and about 6 wings.  It reminded me of the first time I've ever eaten a good slice of pizza and wings.    We went last night for their $5 large cheese pizza night (Wed) and being new to this place, I had no idea why it was so packed (duh), til I saw the special.  We waited for about 10min and were seated.  Jessica was our server and took awesome care of us.  I love it when the servers become your friends and make sure you have the greatest time. Jessica was awesome.  Also being Christmas time, someone was passing around cheese balls. I want to say it was the owner? (because he looks like the owner).  Yum!  We had a great experience, and Im happy to say I found a new favorite pizza place.  Thank you Pullano's!!",

The restaurant itself looked like a lot of fun, but we ordered take-out. We decided that this place was a little expensive for what it was and it probably isn't somewhere we would go without a coupon.",

We weren't there for happy hour but methinks if you want to get happy (beer) & full (pizza) for not a lot of money, this is the place to do it.  They even have an appetizer that made me like artichokes. (And I HATE artichokes) I think the secret ingredient is magic. Also, perhaps copious amounts of butter.  Family-run operation that definitely appears to be a labor of love --- I put this on my Mt. Rushmore of Italian-style eateries in town (along with Uncle Sam's and Santisi Brothers) -- but you can't beat the bang for your buck.",

I've been here too many times to count and have tried over half of their menu. They have the best wings! I like mine pretty hot and I still go with medium here. Their antipasti salad is a must try, with the house Italian dressing. My least favorite thing on the menu is actually the pizza. It's pretty good, just not one of my favorites. All of their pasta dishes are good and I love their soups.   And for dessert, don't miss the pullokie!!!",

My father used to get the chefs salad that cost 15 dollars about that price and we got it again and i like a side salad for the same price 15 dollars. That salad used to be huge now they are going cheap. The og owners would be heart broken about what this plave has became. Very crowded the tables r very small and 4 seater r really 2 seaters.

The cheese is stringy and plentiful, the crust is crispy and sweet, and there are always tons of  toppings. I've also had the wings and cheese curds and both were also fabulous. It's hard to get good cheese curds anywhere in AZ. I'd say these are not the best I have had but they are pretty close. The wings are large, crispy, and always have tons of sauce, and tons of fun and delicious sauces at that. I always forget that they have really great weekly deals, so maybe look those up before you give them a try. They have a deal where you get a free personal Pizza with purchase of a beverage, a buy one get one 50% off Italian meal, and tons more. And if you are looking for a good dive bar there is one attached to the main dinning room that is always poppin.",

She was as patient as she good be with me considering how busy she was. I couldn't make up my mind which style of wings to get, which beer to order or which dressing - ranch or blue cheese. Both of us have worked in a restaurant when younger and know how hard a job it is. Any job that deals directly with the public has its challenges, so here's to you Lil Deb.

Pizza is usually thin as a paper and has little to no flavor. The wings are extremely dry and over cooked. I still keep going back hoping they will redeem themselves but no such luck. Then one of our visits it was my husband and our kids and 2 of their friends and the waitress had the nerve to charge gratuity saying \"the system automatically adds it of parties 8 of more\" which I could understand but not with a party of 6 kids! I've worked as a waitress myself and usually parties of 8 or more adults we could add it. I also feel like their prices are a little outrageous, I know they have to accommodate for the minimum wage raise but still feel like it's a little to pricey.",

The last few pizzas have been very dry and overdone. Picked up an order For almost $50 on a busy Friday night. Pizza was super dry and overdone and not edible. Fortunately, the boneless wings and the crunchers were great so we still had dinner. Pizza went in the trash. Called and spoke to manager on duty and left a message for the owners. We are not ones to call and complain but felt that a restaurant should do something for us, issue credit, etc. An owner called me and offered to send me a gift card. I was very pleasant to all that I spoke to and very diplomatic and thankful. We did enjoy this restaurant. In today's mail, we received a $10 gift card. $10. Anyone who eats here knows that you can't buy much for $10 and an extra large pizza without toppings is 13.99. Wow. I am only rating three stars as the food is normally very good. Unfortunately, this experience is forcing us to find a new pizza and wing place in the West Valley. Wait staff has almost always been great, especially Michele. So long, Pullano's. I wish I could say that the $10 gift card was a nice gesture, but it really didn't sit well.",

The menu is full and includes pizza, wings, salads, calzones etc.  The main dining room (entrance on the east side of the building) is perfect for kids and is large enough for sports teams.  The bar entrance is on the south side of the building.  My hungry family of four shared a cheese bread app, Lg Pizza and 12 wings and brought home plenty of left overs.  My son especially liked the lemonade.  A little on the pricey side but we definitely got what we paid for,  the food was great!  There were plenty of TVS for us to watch the Plays of the Day.",

Quality and quantity. The truth is, I will HAPPILY take a 8 dollars domino pizza over their large pizza (& they are the same size!) This pizza honestly had too much dough and tasted yeasty. I asked my husband if it smelled like it had beer spilled on it - the dough is not great. The taste profile is VERY similar to papa johns. Furthermore, our large pizza cost 16+ bucks. You can go to Luna pizza and get an Extra large pizza, which is double the size for that price. Rays pizza gives you more pizza for cheaper. Look, if they lowered their price it wouldnt be TERRIBLE, or if they increased the amount of food you are getting. However, as it stands the pizza and wings are mediocre. Pizza: too expensive and tastes like papa johns. Crust is too thick to be a True NYC pizza. Boneless Wings: Not bad, however, they are VERY shy with the sauce. May as well calls these chicken nuggets. 14 inch pizza(half pep) & 1lbs boneless wings(roughly 16 wings) 27 bucks. Zucchini: Perhaps the only good thing on the menu, however for about 16 coins of zucchini you will pay 10 bucks. Hands down the most expensive price we have seen. Ranch: probably the best thing we had. Very comparable to Anzios.",

I found the sauce on the wings very watery and fluid rather than viscous and sweet, It gave the wings a very slimy texture in my mouth that just didn't feel right. I'm hoping that that was just a fluke on their part.  Ordered a supreme pizza. The ingredients on it were a mixed bag. The usuals, veggies, pepperoni, mushroom. Oooh shout out to the mushrooms which were actually very very good! And finally, the pizza dough was baked extra crispy so every bite had a satisfying crunch sensation that's so easy to rave about! =)  Also, I hear this place has killer happy hour specials and I'll be back I'm sure eventually and hopefully I can bump this place one star up if they redeem their wings!",

But recently when I went in to eat lunch I was informed that they had a new menu and they no longer serve the giant slice. This in my opinion was a staple of pullanos. I feel there are other pizza places that I will give a try. Hopefully they read this and bring back the giant slice.",

    "text": "Omggg Pullano's, where do I even start? First of all, this place is crazy close to us, which is a huge bonus :) Ever since \"Daddy-O's\" (gag me) took over Casey Jones (such a sad day), we've been looking for a new cheap bar that has a good atmosphere.  Enter: Pullano's! My boyfriend's brother told us about it and we finally went a couple of weeks ago... score!! We've been back twice since and, if we didn't keep ordering practically the entire menu and EATING IT ALL, we would go back more often...  The pizza? Awesome! Customize, order straight off the menu, whatever. Certain days they offer crazy specials on pizza (one special offers you a large pizza for free, if I recall correctly), so that's always worth looking into.  Great prices on pitchers of beer-- end of story. Get crunk (or watch your friends get crunk-- DDs are our friends!) on pitchers of beer from $9 (domestic) to $13.25 (seemingly everything else).  The servers are all young and very friendly, which is totally sweet. We've never had a mean or grumpy server-- huge plus. You may even get lucky and have one of the owners serve you, which is so cute, in my opinion.  Thursdays are the days to get wings (although I don't know if this changes...?? Call or check online). When we went (on a Thursday), wings were $.40 and, according to my boyfriend, really good.  I'm personally a fan of the pizza (duh) and the happy hour prices for appetizers-- um, $4 for a GIANT plate of bruschetta? Yeah, sign me up!  The only \"downsides\", if you can call it that, is that the place is ALWAYS busy. We've gone on a Thursday night, a Saturday around 3 p.m, and a Friday around 8... not \"dead\" times but not exactly hopping... but Pullano's was BUSY. Be prepared to wait 5 min. more and have to maneuver around large parties (that inexplicably like to push their chairs into the aisle...)  The other thing is the menu--- holy crap. Be prepared to sit there for a solid 10 min. trying to understand it all if its your first time there. The menu is HUGE and the print is really tiny. I mean, I'm practically blind, so take that with a grain of salt, but still. It's tiny print. Just be warned.  That said-- don't go. This is my bar, y'all ;)",

The service was excellent and the waitstaff was friendly, so I added one star. The restaurant area was lackluster, but I did not really care (it's all about the food). We got 1lb of boneless wings, Mac and cheese bites, and zucchini and mushroom bites. The bill came out to $50. We could've had better food at a nicer place for that.  The Mac and Cheese bites tasted like fried Kraft brand. The zucchini bites were pretty good, but the mushrooms were so bad! I couldn't eat them. I'm finding it hard to describe how bad they were.  My husband got wings, and said they were okay.  The bill was outrageous and my food was abysmal. I feel ripped off. We would've been better off getting microwaved food from Trader Joe's.   I really wanted to like this place! I was glad the bar area was separate from the restaurant. Sober people beware.",

    "text": "We came into this restaurant for about the 500th time (over the last 15 years) and were overcharged without warning.  We purchased a LocalFlavor certificate which we've done before over the years.  Rather than separating the bill for the different parties present, all of the specials and happy hour deals were marked back up to regular price for every person, not just the LocalFlavor holder.  Of course, this was never told to anyone in the group until after the fact so everyone's bill was penalized and overcharged.  This was finally disclosed AFTER the certificate was redeemed and the owner's daughter (acting manager) refused to re-ring it.  Net result: everyone WAY overpaid for their items unfairly and left unhappy without an ounce of remorse or understanding from management.  A restaurant can only rip me off once...never again.  Easy 1-star because there isn't a 0-star option.  This place used to be decent but now is definitely one to avoid.  **Update on 6/28 after Owner's response: Mike, we ordered an XL pizza and wings at full menu price in order to use our LocalFlavor certificate (not Groupon), nobody had a problem with that part.  The problem is your server never said that you would refuse to split the check up for the different parties in the group (something every restaurant in the world does), nor was there any mention that nobody would receive the happy hour pricing on their beers or appetizers because one person used his certificate for a regular priced pizza and wings.  He told the server immediately upon sitting down yet we were pitched $2 beer pints and half-priced appetizers by the server.  We were only told you wouldn't honor anything after the bill came and your manager refused to re-ring it.  Everyone was overcharged rather than the just the party that was apparently dumb enough to buy your LocalFlavor offering.  We literally paid you $10 for about 10 fried zucchini rings (obviously marked way up so you can do your half-price apps and have them make the slightest bit of pricing sense).  Even factoring in the one person's LocalFlavor certificate, we paid WAY over the retail pricing overall.  The worst part was your staff leading us to ordering things based on pricing they knew they weren't going to honor.  We were forced overpay after-the-fact because of the deception of your staff.  100% rip off and I will never step foot into your \"restaurant\" again.  Do they right thing and refund the money you stole.",

The stone keg is always empty.  Please get some real independent craft breweries in here.  Preferably local.  There are a ton of good ones out there.    Why is this so hard to do and keep going?

They love this place so I'm kinda mad they haven't taken me here before, haha!   Our server was soo nice and helpful. Our drinks were never empty (which I love about servers), and she made great recommendations. I was debating between lasagna, ziti or the spaghetti calzone. I asked my server what she'd pick and her face lit up with calzone so I knew it was good. I'm so glad I went with her recommendation. The calzone was soo good and so big I had to take half home. The portions are great for the price. You can definitely tell everything is homemade. We shared the boneless wings and wow they were good. The bone in wings looked good, but I rather use my fork so boneless it is. We had medium sauce and garlic parm which was such a good decision.   Overall, I loved it.

We picked up our order just 15 minutes later.  The pizza was great, it was a little greasy, which we like, but definitely not too greasy. Flavor was great! The hot wings were also great, a good size, crispy and sauced just right. The sauce (hot) was so good!  We will definitely be ordering pizza and wings from Pullanos again!",

I ordered 24 wings and got 36.  I asked to be charged full price for the wings I ordered, but NOPE!  I was to be charged for what I got.  I also bought a Groupon that I literally have NEVER been able to use for like 6 months.  Every time I try to use it, there's a reason why I can't.  You'll see other reviews very similar to mine.  Nothing new here.  They got 2 starts because the servers are good and food is decent.  If you ever have any issue, do not expect any customer service or resolution.",

The breadsticks are soaked in butter and perfect for dunking into the wedding soup. Will definitely eat here again.",

It has 3 sections; the sports bar area, dine in room and take out only section. We wanted take out so after just a bit of confusion of where we should be we ordered our pizza and had a short wait. The staff was excellent as was the pizza. They have many specials most  include wings. We will go back and get one of the specials. I really want to try their wings since that seems to be their signature dish.",

Beer:  Cold, clean taps.  Have some.  Is the selection going to blow away my hipster pals?  No.  BUT, who's going to a perfectly dive-y place like this looking for hipster beer selection?  Booze:  Right down the middle.  Pouring fast and strong.  I. Like. It.  Now for the late night food:  They have free pop corn and pizza all night.  Let me say again.  Free: Pizza and popcorn.    Pool table: looks like it's been hit with a hammer a couple two three four(teen) times.  If you're cool with that and just want something to do while you eat free food and drink, then you're in for a great night.  Jukebox:  It's a fancy pants digital jukebox but you'll find all sorts of good drinking anthems and more.    Why would you not go here?  Because you prefer the sterile cavernous, loud, flashing light d-baggery that takes place near the stadium.  Let's be real if you're the type that really loves tucking into the Gordon Beirch horror show, I'm not sure you've got the stuff it takes to hang out here.  For the rest of you....cheers.",

Now the wings when asked for crispy and that's what I got the sauce is good very good. it's vice versa with the wings if I start with the wings I forget about the pizza so I battle with a balance every time I eat here.

    "text": "I met a friend at Pullanos on a Monday night, and they were broadcasting MNF. There is two sides to the restaurant, a bar type side with high tables and lots of big flat screens, and then theres a dining side with long tables to accomodate large parties. We sat ourselves and our server Amber wasnt terribly quick to approach us, but she was nice.   After she took our drink order, another server came and asked us to move because she supposedly had some big party that was going to arrive. Now, we were sitting at a table that could accommodate a party. However, there was a perfectly fine table right behind ours that she could have sat them at, and left us alone. i could see if the place was super packed, but it wasnt, and they never even used that table that was behind us! it was completely open the whole night.  That pissed me off a good bit, and this is why i gave the 3 star rating instead of a 4.   Anyhow, our server brought the drinks and took our order. Now...i have a love affair with wings, and im starting to venture into the spicy side of life. so after consulting with Amber, i decided upon the Super Hot (or as the reciept says, XXXHot). The only difference between the Hot, and Super Hot is that they dont put butter into the sauce for Super Hot. Sounds like a peice of cake, right?  HELL NO.  it literally took me 30 min to finish 10 wings with this sauce on it. With snot in my nose and tears in my eyes, at wing no. 4 the midsize 2 alarm blaze in my mouth could only be smoldered with lots of ice, and sips of water. After that, i had to eat them one at a time, then take a break. Everytime our waitress came back to check on me, i was one wing less. I think she knew i was struggling, but she didnt laugh at me once. I did not leave that table till i finished them all, and i actually enjoyed the challenge (apparently the Super Hot is no. 3 on the totem pole. She said they have one with the Ghost pepper in it. Ouch). A gentleman sitting next to us ordered a VERY delicious looking pizza, along with two big bowls of wings. said it only costed him 25 or 30 bucks.   So if you love wings, and like em hot, you need to give this place a shot. The food was great tasting (and looking) and i would love to come back and try something else. the menu is huge so you have lots to choose from.",

Both of which are great atmospheres to have lunch/dinner.   The food here is great and the pricing is reasonable. A couple of great items on their menu are the Baked White Ziti and Dessert Pulookie. Both are fantastic.   On our last visit I had the chance to try the Bacon Mac' N ' CheeseBurger. WAY too much food for me in a sitting but I can tell you it was out of the ordinary and it tasted amazing.  Top notch food here and a great place to bring family and friends. I always look forward to getting the opportunity to come down to this place. Kudos.",

They are always cooked just the way I like them (super crispy on the outside but not dried out on the inside) and they have this Italian Dry Spice that I can't get enough of. Other favorites include their thin crust pizzas and a hot Italian sandwich that can literally feed two people.   They have awesome drink specials too! My wife and I would always go on Sundays because it was dollar drafts on everything! I don't believe this is valid during football season but prior to that I was there consistently every week. Oh did I mention free nacho bar on Sundays?!?!   Definitely a place I recommend and go to every chance I get!",

The food comes out quickly and the servers are friendly and great.

But I was highly disappointed first thing is there is a menu online that they said wasn't there menu even though it has your address and your phone number which was highly disappointing cause it has very different pricing that I am pretty sure you have to honor but didn't feel like arguing about it. Then when i went to pick up the order not one of your many servers standing around talking to each other bothered to greet us. Stood in line for 10 minutes before one of your chatty servers decided to walk over and finally help us. Even if they weren't there to help us one of them could have said \" I am really sorry about the wait and the take out person is busy gathering another order\". I have worked in customer service for 10 plus years. So I would just say the service was just awful. It takes 2 seconds from their socializing to just acknowledge a paying customer. Just overall dissatisfying especially for the price.",

    "text": "I'm so shocked by all the 5 star reviews about the food here. This place was lauded to me for weeks by a friend, and I was under the impression it was some sort of pizza institution a kin to Pizza Bianco. Alas, it is not.   So we put in an order for take out; wings and a large pizza for $27. A bit steep, but I was told it was good...  I've had outstanding pizza, I've had the less-than-memorable, standard issue pizza, and I've had truly bad pizza. Pullano's certainly falls into the last category.  Cheese was cheap; entire top of the pizza was covered in a slick of oil, a sure sign of budget ingredients. The sauce had zero flavor. And the crust. Wow. Got the thin crust, and although it wasn't chewy, which is always a plus, that was all it had going for it. Soggy, flacid, flavorless. Seemed under cooked and I was underwhelmed.   I could only stomach one slice, because after that, the roof of my mouth felt like I had just taken a swig of 90 weight gear oil. So greasy.   The wings were passable. Semi-crispy, but swimming in a sauce that was 90% oil and 10% red goo. Real let down here, too.  It's not hard for a bar to turn out a solid pizza, like Santisi Brothers. And I know bars that make exceptional pizzas, like Brown Dog in Telluride. But Pullano's is churning out a product that is better measured against Little Caesars than a real restaurant.   Flock here if you love oil and tasteless carbs. But avoid if you like good pizza, as there's plenty of better choices in town. Papa John's does a better forgettable pizza than Pullano's at a much more reasonable price.",

Mine came out and it wasn't thin crust but regular crust, they confirmed my call-in ticket and offered to make new ones. Like the others I took it because I didn't want to wait, I was not very satisfied. next time if there's a next time ill ask for my money back and go to Barrows.",

My only complaint is that they make the breadsticks differently each time we order them so sometimes they are awesome and other times they are just okay. I've learned to ask for the pamesan breadsticks as they are the best!    If you have room for dessert, get the Pullookie! It's great!",
