This time we ordered a few different dishes and I came away rather unimpressed. The hummus had way too much tahani as it had a very strong peanut flavor. I was also not crazy about the chicken and rice dish my date ordered. Both times I had gyro meat and enjoyed it, but some of the other things changed, such as the service. Dinner service was not nearly as good, which I somewhat understand because there were so many more people, but if you want people to come back to your establishment, you gotta always have good help.",

I love the way the friendly servers greet, seat  and attend to you.  We started off with the Tabouli salad.  I am going to go out on a limb and tell you that this is one of the best (maybe even the best) Tabouli I have ever had hands down.  Fresh and well prepared served with pita bread.  A must try.  I ordered the Moroccan Chicken and it was wonderful--with just a hint of spiciness.  It came with beautiful, fluffy yellow rice with almonds.  Are you hungry yet?  You should be if you were imagining what this wonderful dish looked like.  Chicken with raisins, nuts, peppers onions... yum.   Hubby had Lamb Kabob salad --a generous portion of assorted salad greens, feta cheese and generous, generous portions of grilled lamb.  So good his eyes were twirling in his head.  (By the way,  this is the perfect choice for dinner during the summer months--what could be better than a salad and high quality grill meats???)   After hubby cleaned his plate,  he managed to steal a few bite-fulls of my Moroccan Chicken.  You see my portion was so large I couldn't finish it so he was hovering over my leftovers like a buzzard in the desert.  I quickly had it packed up before the vulture struck again.  (It's in the fridge now waiting to be my  lunch tomorrow)   We couldn't have dessert... not enough room.  But what I did have after dinner was a wonderful conversation with the owner, Nahren.  I wanted to tell her how much we enjoyed our dinner at Eden Grill and we talked about all the New Times Awards on her walls and her \"A\" rating from the health department which is proudly posted on the bar counter.  How many of the restaurants that you have been to lately have their health department ratings for all to see, just saying.   Well the food here is fresh, well prepared and delicious... what else can one say about a restaurant??? Well, you can say that the staff is amazing, especially the owner. See you soon, Eden Grill!",

    "text": "It seems that small, family-owned restaurants often have the best food. You want something authentic? Don't go to a chain. It is not, however, a rule, and a family-owned restaurant still needs to stand on its own merits.  Eden's Grill Inn came up as one of the most highly rated lunch spots in the area, and I am always looking for good Mediterranean places, so I decided to stop in. The first thing I noticed is the paltry offering of lamb dishes on the menu. Besides the gyros, there is only a lamb kebab salad (but no lamb kebab offered as an entree). Shish kebab should be made out of lamb, not beef. This place is clearly catering to the Western palate.  I had the gyros sandwich, which was enormous and came with fries.  I also had a lentil soup on the side, which was fantastic, and the highlight of the meal. It was the only part of the meal that reminded me of the real legit Lebanese food I so enjoy.  The gyro sandwich, while humongous, had meat that was chopped ultra thin. This completely ruins it; it seems to dry the meat out (I couldn't finish the sandwich for lack of saliva) and makes it lose the wonderful texture that chunkier slices of gyro meat have. It really just had no substance.  This place is certainly not bad, and it's a nice neighborhood spot. It just doesn't stand out from all the other Mediterranean places with the same beef and chicken offerings. Not when Saba's is just down the street.",

The one thing we were disappointed with was the fact that since everything was so good, we are going to have to make the journey up here more often.  When coming to a new restaurant, especially one that has a cuisine we are familiar with, we like to sample an assortment from the appetizer menu. Not only was the owner/server exceptionally friendly, but the food was homemade, authentic, and served in a timely fashion.  I can say that we felt everything was slightly under-salted, but we much more prefer that to the alternative and having to gulp water the entire meal. The appetizers, including the dolmades, were entirely scratch made, and serving sizes were more than generous.  The large portion sizes of the entrees left enough for a second meal while the flavors and menu choices made for a Mediterranean dining experience that was a nice change from some of the run-of-the-mill restaurants out there. We will certainly be back to try more from the menu. The Adam and Eve and Moroccan Chicken are both killer plates in the entree department; we truly were not disappointed in any of our selections.  If you have the chance, try out this spot hidden in the corner of a strip mall! The dining room is very small, but if you end up having to wait for a table it will be well worth it.",

    "text": "Mom and I arrived to find EG bustling during lunch (it was around 1:15 pm).  There were around ten tables of different shapes and numbers of chairs.  Our server Noreen was amiable and eager.  She took our orders of water and left us to look at the menus.  I didn't find the lamb entree Mom mentioned, and when I asked Noreen about it, she said that while it was only on the dinner menu, she could get the kitchen to cook it.  Mom balked at the price ($18.95), so we stuck with the lunch menus.  She wanted to try the Gyros (#6), which came with \"Mom's Rice with toasted raisins and almonds, grilled bell peppers, onions and tomatoes.\"  (No pic taken- sorry!)  The menu also mentioned that fries came with the order, but Mom's entree came without it.  I unfortunately did not know, or I would've asked Noreen about it.  I ordered the Chicken lunch combo, which was a chicken pita and choice of side (salad or fries) and beverage for $7.95, as well as Mom's Favorite Appetizer Platter (\"tabula, falafal, and potato cake\"), $13.95.    <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=brmcSOiLLJM3Girn0_3nXw#brmcSOiLLJM3Girn0_3nXw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eden...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=iP5cjNX1xAP9xQBZfa2RNQ#iP5cjNX1xAP9xQBZfa2RNQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eden...</a>  Mom enjoyed her meal!  She ooh'ed and ahh'ed over the rice (which I tried in spite of a rice allergy, and yes it was good), as well as the pita that the lamb and beef slices were served on.  She preferred it over the standard pita that came with the appetizer plate.  When she mentioned to Noreen that her pita tasted better than the other pita we had on the table, Noreen kind of leaned in and said it was made in-house and that they cost a $1 a piece.  I asked Mom to break off a tiny piece, and sure enough, it felt different (thicker, more doughy, and a bit greasy) and tasted fresh from the fryer, making the store-bought pita seem like cardboard.  I didn't like the greasy aftertaste, though, but I did appreciate the flavor of butter in the beginning and the pita's textures.    I also enjoyed my chicken entree, which had juicy grilled chunks of chicken, strips of greens and tomato and onion slices (which I picked off before taking photos). <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=1o5oZXbNdAK7_YNDihQ0Vw#1o5oZXbNdAK7_YNDihQ0Vw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eden...</a>  The \"white sauce\" was a nice accompaniment, although the chicken didn't need it.  Mom and I split the side salad- it was good, although I found the dressing to be too tart.  I enjoyed- tremendously, I might add- the potato cakes that came in the appetizer plate... Wow!  Am I glad I spotted that Yelper's tip to order them!  They're basically button-shaped croquettes filled with seasoned and juicy ground beef.  Definitely a must-try!  I also enjoyed the falafel, even if they were a bit on the dry side, and a bit harder-to-the-touch than other falafel balls I've tried.  The sauce it came with was too bitter.  The tabula was too tart!  I could only bear about three small forkfuls before walking to where Noreen was, standing behind a counter, to tell her about it, and that perhaps the kitchen should taste it and understand what I mean.  She offered to replace it with \"homous,\" and I took her up on it. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=E5NYPbb9moOZyX2VMl9kpg#E5NYPbb9moOZyX2VMl9kpg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eden...</a>  It had a pleasant mouth-feel, but again, I found it a bit sour.  Noreen later came back to say that the I was right- the tabula was very sour, that it needed more parsley, and to thanked me for letting them know.    Mom agreed with Su-Shien's review I read to her about size portions-- they were generous, and Mom likes generous servings, especially when they taste as good as her entree!  She wished she'd ask for more of the rice, instead of the homemade pita that we were sent home with, with an accompanying charge of $2.  I told her we could always go back for more...  Last, but not least, we had some baklava, two pcs., $4.  Mom and I split one- it was perfect!  Loved the buttery, toasted, and flaky crust, and the rich, walnut filling.  It was so good that I could've eaten the second piece in a heartbeat, but also so satisfying that I didn't feel the need to overdo it.  A great way to end a good meal.  I'd return back just to have more of those potato cakes! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/edens-grill-inn-phoenix?select=6RVy7cQMG8RVosc6PvM3fQ#6RVy7cQMG8RVosc6PvM3fQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eden...</a>  #710",

It costs the restaurant nothing, and seems wrong to me. To avoid paying the sharing penalty, we started with the house salad. It was large and a run of the mill salad. The feta cheese was plentiful, but not all that flavorful.   We then had the beef kabob. The portion was generous. The beef was ordered medium rare, but came out medium well done. The highlight of the meal was the rice and vegetables. The almonds and raisins make the rice special and tasty. The pita that was served with the dinner was supermarket pita, not fresh.  To finish the disappointing dinner, a party of 5 that had made a reservation came in as we were finishing up. The waitress was told to give us our check quickly so they could turn over our table, even thought there were plenty of tables open. Like I said, a bit of a disappointing dining experience.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed the food at Eden's Grill, but the service was not up to the quality of the food .  Stopped in for lunch on Monday.  Two other tables were occupied.  I was given a huge leather bound menu.  Lunch specials listed in this book were $9.95 and up, and all included rice.  I wanted salad, so I ordered the $15.95 Steak Kabob Salad, a price far higher than I would normally pay at lunch.  It was very tasty, and I enjoyed the balsamic dressing.  The almonds and raisins on the salad were a nice touch, and the steak was perfectly medium as ordered.  I was disappointed that a salad at this price was not even accompanied by a warm pita.  Companion ordered the $6.50 chicken pita ala carte.   Server asked if we wanted the lunch special since it comes with rice, but we just went with the salad and chicken sandwich because \"I wanted a salad\".  I also assumed she was referring to the $9.95 and up specials in the leather menu book, which weren't really very special at all. The pita had very generous portion of delicious meat, tomatoes and lettuce on a pita.   We ordered only water to keep down the cost, but with tax and tip we spent $30 on lunch and had NO LEFTOVERS but two cubes of steak.  Ouch.  Service was fine, not outstanding, but not bad.  As we were leaving, we stumbled upon a little A-frame sign outside, hiding behind a pillar on the back side, facing away from the parking lot and restaurant entrance.  This sign indicated six lunch specials with a choice of rice, fries or salad for $7.95 including a drink.  Wow, that is a solid deal!    After studying this menu for a few minutes, I stuck my head back inside and motioned for our server to come out for a moment.  I showed her the sign and asked why we were not offered this menu when we were seated.  She said it was usually on all the tables and gestured (to 10 tables with no lunch menus on them).   So I said, we just spent $30 on lunch, when we could have spent half that.  She offered to give us all our money back, but since the food was excellent, I said I just wanted to pay the lunch special price for our meals.  Some cash was refunded, but the experience left a bad taste in our mouth even though the server \"hoped we would come back\".    I would have ordered quite differently if we had been given all the facts.  I might have tried a sandwich with my salad.  I might have gotten to taste that highly recommended rice.  I would have enjoyed an iced tea instead of water!     Was that an attempt to get us to spend more by not offering the value lunch specials??   I saw two other tables that had ordered a variety of items, none of which were lunch specials either.   HMMMMM.",

Mom does the cooking and her recipes are executed and seasoned to perfection.  Located in a small strip mall next to the hardware store. This place is small but cozy and very simply decorated. They have an assortment of table sizes based on your group. The larger tables can easily accommodate those bigger family occasions.  Normally come here for lunch and get one of the specials. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. You can also request something off the dinner menu if you wish. This is a larger menu with items that are a little bit more fancy.  My favorite so far is the Moroccan Chicken. She makes mine extra spicy and it is delicious. The Kebabs are also very good and the Salads are humongous. Mom's top secret Rice is so good that it just melts in your mouth. It is covered with toasted raisins and almonds and is at the top of my list to reproduce at home.  Service is very friendly and helpful. You are always told to make yourself at home. They go out of there way to answer any of my questions or request.  Food is always fresh and tasty and we always leave feeling full. Still have not had a chance to try out any of the many tasty desserts. Good reason to come back sooner than later.

She was so friendly, attentive and shared information as we inquired about specific dishes.  We started out with the Combo Appetizers (various dips & hummus, domeh-grape leaves), flat bread (w/feta, basil & tomato) and tabula.  That let us know that everything was going to be great.  Our group order various dishes from: Moroccan Chicken (Spicy), Adam and Eve (Chicken & Beef Kabobs), Lamb and Gyros, Lamb and Beef Kebab, Mediterranean Catfish.  This allow many of us to try each other's food.  It was all well cooked and seasoned to perfection and so full of flavor. I was particularly impressed with the chicken.  Often times, white meat can be dry, especially when grilled, but this was so juicy and moist.  The Moroccan was full of herbal seasoning, don't let the word spicy scare you hear.  It's a completely different meaning...not hot, just full of rich seasoned flavoring.  And the rice was equally seasoned and flavored well with raisins & slivers of almonds.  I will definitely make this a regular habit.",

    "text": "This is a tough one. Saw the place on Check Please and decided to give it a try. I called to make reservations. When I indicated that I was interested in reservations for the same evening, the response was they were booked solid. I asked if anything was possible earlier in the evening and that worked. Not the friendliest interchange in the world.  Our friends arrived before us. They knew about the reservation ahead of time. They told me when they walked in, instead of a warm greeting, they said the waitress looked annoyed that they were there and instead of a hello, were told we have no tables unless you have a reservation. Interesting greeting. This same person did not wait on us but comes back into the story below.  Once we were all seated the 4 of us were very cramped. The restaurant itself is very small and so are the tables. There were no table cloths that the chef described as a staple of the restaurant when on Check Please.  We were promptly greeted once seated. We ordered drinks and the appetizer combo of Homous and Baba Ganoosh along with leaf wrapped rice (forgot the name). They were served with warm pita bread and were very very good. The lack of room on the small table made things challenging with the appetizers on the table but we got through it.  I ordered the Moroccan Chicken. I will get to that later. The rest of the entrees included a Gyro, Adam and Eve (beef and chicken over rice) and lastly a Chicken Filet Kebob. With the exception of the Moroccan Chicken, the food was amazingly good. The portions were huge. Everyone loved their entrees, except for me. I was really disappointed in the Moroccan Chicken. Others at the table tasted it and also thought it did not stand up to the other dishes on the table.  Another observation we made had to do with the waitress that was not waiting on us. The shorter one. I believe they are sisters. This is the same person responsible for the greeting described above. Due to the fact that the restaurant was so small and the fact that most if not all tables were full, there was very little room in the aisles for anyone to get through, including the waitresses. Each time this other waitress would start walking toward the table next to us she would realize that she could not get through and she would glare at our table as if it was somehow our fault she could not get through. She made it clear she was upset about it. This didn't happen once, twice, but 3 or 4 times throughout the time we sat there. It was very awkward and made things uncomfortable. Once we were finished and had just paid the check, this same person (did not wait on us) starts clearing the table hastily and letting us know she wants us to go. We tried to make small talk and be friendly, but she was not having any of that. We took the hint. Granted we had just paid the check and the restaurant at that time had 3 empty tables, but nonetheless, we felt pushed out.  The reason I bring this up, is because the person I described above was the exact opposite of the waitress that had our table. Though it was very clear our waitress was very busy, she was very warm and made us feel like we were welcomed family. She took very good care of us. But I have to admit, it took her a bit to warm up at first.  I would love to give this 5 stars. The food (other than the Moroccan Chicken)  deserves 5 stars alone. However, the extremely small restaurant coupled with small tables and full crowd made it very uncomfortable to eat there. That cost one star. The second star was lost by how the other waitress interacted with our party. I will try again and try something else.",

We did not expect our evening to be so enjoyable, tasty, and fullfilling. We enjoyed a bottle of wine, some apps, salad, and wedding cake!! The portions were generous and full of flavor. Come to find out, this place has been here for 25 years. The 2 sisters were our servers, super friendly, and their Mom was the cook, super quick!  Hard pass up on showing appreciation to a great family owned business!!!!",

I had literally been craving a gyro all day, seriously a random craving(not pregnant), and so I did a quick Google search, read some reviews & decided alright let's try it!  Seriously for $7.95 I think I just ripped them off for how much food came with it.  The tzatziki was PERFECT and refreshing, the pita was warm & soft and the meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection.    I can't rave enough about this place & I've only tried it once!  CAN NOT wait to go back!  Oh and should I also mention their \"A\" rating from 3/18/13 posted in front, that always makes me feel warm & tingly inside knowing how well they take care of their restaurant(I've been through those state inspections!)",

Then we shared the gyros, chicken and beef kabob combination plate which serves two and came with a big plate of rice. All I can say is we were in heaven while eating this..everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. We had a little rice and gyros leftover so the waitress packaged it up and filled the to go box with rice and extra sauce and pita..which came out to a full meal in itself. The place is a little small but filled up quickly and service was friendly and we never had to ask for anything. If your craving Greek food treat yourself to Eden's",

    "text": "Stumbled upon this place from Yelp when looking for something new to have for take out.  I rolled into the restaurant around 845 (they close at 9), and placed an order to go.  Normally some places like this get kind of cranky if you order that close to closing, but the lady who helped me was so nice.  I believe her name is Nahren....one of the owners.  I had the Dolmeh (grape leaves) appetizer and the Gyros entree.  The Dolmeh, which was served warm, was pretty darn good, a little different than I've had it before, but the style can vary based on which country the recipe is originating from...in this case Iran I believe.  It's hard to really screw up gyros, and gyros meat will be pretty consistent in taste no matter where you go.  But here, there was something that separated it from the rest, it was really flavorful.  The gyros comes with sides of pita to wrap it in, tzatziki sauce, onions, tomatoes...and is all served over amazingly delicious basmati rice with golden raisins and almonds in it. Sooo good.  When the food was ready and I got the bill it was like $23 something.  I thought wow, this is kinda expensive...but when I got home and opened my food, I was blown away at how HUGE the portions were.  I got at least 3 meals for myself out of it.  This place did not disappoint, I'm excited to go back and try some more of their entree's as I'm sure they are delish.",

My girlfriend had the ground beef kabob ( I don't remember the name) and that too was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Eden's Grill is out of the way from where we live but it's worth the drive and we'll definitely be back. Go here if you want a great meal, good portions, all in a simple laid back place.

I've been a handful of times and have tried quite a few menu items - the appetizers are all spot on and the entrees are huge portions.  Some of my favorites are:  - Dolmeh (fresh, warm stuffed grape leaves - a world away from the typical cold, slimy canned ones many places offer) - Falafel (crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside - served with a tasty tahini sauce) - Tabbouleh (nice herb/tomato to bulgur ratio and good seasoning)  Note to the wise: unless you're really, really hungry (or if you want leftovers), stick to either a few apps to share or just to the entrees.  Any more than that will be too much!  Service has always been both friendly and speedy - just note the hours before heading over, because we've stopped by on occasion and it's been closed.",

The gyro meat is really tasty and I've now gotten the gyro and chicken kebab salad the last two times and the chicken is super good as well.  The rest of the salad is a little meh but the meat is the thing!  I also am not in love with their tzatziki sauce as it's a little thicker than I generally like it but all in all it's a good salad.  I've also had their gyro platter, which was humungous - I think it took me 3 meals to finish it.  Again, the gyro meat is great. As for the rice with the raisins and nuts - it is pretty good but I almost think the idea of it is better than the actual execution.  Does that make sense? I eat it and love it but it's like there's just something missing with it and I'm not sure what it is.  The fragrance is great and, for someone who generally doesn't like raisins, I really like the raisins and nuts in it.  I will keep returning for the tasty meat... I think next time I will just try a pure chicken dish so I can get more of that tasty chicken!",

Definitely try this place if you like fresh, well prepared Mediterranean!",

Everything we ate their was amazing, and flavorful. They ambiance could be better. It's small, and in a L-shaped plaza, but because the food was amazeballs, I could careless. They also sold us bandeleros tickets to casino Arizona and for gypsy kings. Love them. Try everything here. The restaurant is NOT greek. I hate when people say it is. It's ignorance. It's TRUE AUTHENTIC ASSYRIAN FOOD! ASSYRIAN FOOD. That's all. Thanks.",

We stopped in about an hour before they closed. The server was so friendly and sweet and we were promptly seated. The table next to us was very chatty and friendly as well.   We started off with the potato cakes which were the perfect portion for an appetizer and were very good.   The boyfriend ordered the Adam and Eve and I ordered the kefta and chicken.  Both were superb. I don't know what the chicken was marinated in, but was so juicy and flavorful; it tasted entirely different than any other Greek Kabob I've had. I also tried some of the beef kabob and would highly recommend that as well.  My other kabob was the kefta and I'll be honest-- it wasn't my favorite, but that's what I get for trying something new.   Both plates came with rice with white raisins and slivered almonds.  On top of the rice was marinated grilled vegetables. I could've eaten a plate of that alone! Be forewarned that when you come here, the portions are HUGE. We easily could've split a plate, although we'd have been fighting over the chicken!",

I am not going to lie, when I first walked in I wasn't expecting much - possibly because there was blue hair and walkers in every direction, but we decided to give it a change because of the ratings on yelp.  The ambiance is okay... Although, its pretty small and can get stuffy! We had the unlucky chance of sitting next to the door and we kept having to scoot towards the wall or move the table so people could squeeze by. That aside, the food was surprisingly good.   They have a small drink menu and we wanted to try some of the unique beers; we ordered effes and almaza - mmm both were pretty tasty!   For the appetizer we went with the hummus. Unfortunately, this was the worst part of the meal. It was dry and tasted like it came from a package. I became a little worried about the entree, but we forged on.   We decided to try the shish kebab combo - DELICIOUS! My friend and I were surprised the ground beef kebab ended up being one of the best things we ate. It has a nice texture and was seasoned very well.The steak kebab was cooked perfectly! The chicken was good, maybe a little dry, but the side sauces helped with that.   I wouldn't recommend the hummus, but otherwise this place is serving up some delicious food.",

We were in the mood for some authentic Greek food and we were not disappointed.  The dining room was small and quaint, we sat ourselves but were immediately greeted by our waitress who made us feel like family.  We split the appetizer sampler which was delicious and perfect to share.  The entree portions looked large so each couple split one entree and we still had leftovers.  We had the Edens Grilled chicken and the other couple we were with had the Moroccan Chicken which looked amazing and were told it tasted amazing as well.  The chicken was seasoned and grilled to perfection.  The staff was great and attentive, again we felt like family.  They joked with us like they knew us and made the whole dining experience one we will remember for some time.",

She also made excellent recommendations. The tzaziki sauce was amazing, good pita (I prefer mine warm though) and stuffed grape leaves all were great appetizers. We did 3 huge combo platters and ate family style. I couldn't believe how much food we got-- it was an incredible deal. Beef lamb gyro chicken all cooked perfectly and with delicious sauces. There was one that was kind of green and minty and I was basically eating it with my fork alone. We even had tons of food leftover which was awesome. The combos came with rice too which was so good and has almonds in it which was so different but I loved the crunch. I would definitely return here",

Need just a few more mins to take a look at the menu.  Server was very busy - 7 tables at one point.  Hence, not the friendliest, but she was efficient.  Table next to is asked about dessert and she blew him off with a curt answer and kept walking.  I know you're busy, but you ARE the face of the business.  Couple she blew off promptly left.  We ordered the lunch special - gyro with fries, I had salad vs fries and it was great.  The portion is very generous, hot and delicious.  After a couple of tables left and she brought the check, then she decided to \"turn on the charm\".  A bit late for her to start that.

The dish was fairly spicy but not over the top, and the great flavors came through loud and clear. This was from their dinner menu so the portion was generous.  The service was fine. The server was attentive without being overbearing. Everyone was very friendly, and I understand why so many people are regulars here!  Since it's a storefront in a shopping center, I didn't expect much ambiance. Even so, soft music was playing, and there were nice painting on the walls. Most importantly, the place was very clean (including the men's room). The only issue I had was the level of noise, given the number of people.

The chicken kabob plate is untouchable the freshness the flavor and it's amazing how juicy the chicken is itself. The inside of this place is very clean and very well taken care of.. If you want some liquor with your food that won't be a problem at this amazing place. I recommended people to save room for dessert because oh my oh my.. Everything they make here is amazing and it's a experience you don't want to miss because Pita Jungle and my big fat Greek are not real food and they stop you from enjoying something that is good and something someone puts effort to make good for the people..",

She runs the room like a pro. So, why five stars?  Because the food is spot on incredible, and their rice is the best carb-load in town. We get the number two combo platter to go (our two young girls make it difficult to eat out). We skip the questionable service and come home with enough food for at least four meals.   I can't recommend the food here highly enough. The service, well, not so much.  Oh, and get a slice of the daughter's wedding cake. It's just the tool to get you off of the Atkins wagon.",

The other 2 are Haj-Baba Tempe 1513 e Apache Blvd.,this is also a small family owned grocery store combo and the last one is Baiz Market, which is a big grocery store/ small restaurant combo,523 N 20th st Phoenix. But back to Eden's this North side GREAT restaurant. Yes it is small ,NOT STIFLING (quit the opposite mentioned by a DR ) with some sitting outside (when the weather is right) family BUSINESS. They have a VERY AUTHENTIC lunch and dinner menu, both great portions. The management is very POLITE and the kitchen being small delivers exceptional platings. Pay more for FOOD and not for circus's. If you really love HEALTHY Gastronomy this is one of your Stops for either lunch or dinner.",

Potato Cakes are a good appetizer with a great cucumber/yogurt sauce. Baba Ganoush was very good. Morrocan Chicken (spicy) was savory and truly a star of the evening. Don't let 'spicy' dissuade you - it really has very little heat.  My wife was very pleased with the Vegetarian Stew. The other three in our party had different kabob combinations: Adam & Eve, Chicken, and Beef & Lamb. All drew raves. All 5 dishes were generous portions with equally generous servings of flavorful rice - topped with raisins and almonds.",

A side of creamy goodness and some of the best rice I have laid my lips upon and you've got yourself one mighty fine meal.  The gyros, chicken and beef kebab combination ($33) says it feeds two, but I think it would be more than enough for six NFL players or eight midgets...I mean, little people ( approximately seven average sized humans).

Strange but I couldn't have just taken a table anyway, because the 3 or4 tables that were empty were still  dirty and unattended..  Not at all on the ball for sure! Good indication of the food servers and pace of service!! Overwhelmed and only seating for 30-35 people MAX.. Tables are on top of each other.   So I walked back to rear counter , soda or serving station, I assume cashier ? and was approached by a lady and asked what I wanted? I said dinner and she replies me too !! I couldn't believe it !!!, I assume she is the owners wife? if so , I suggest telling your wife to stay home. , if she isn't I would TERM her., SHE IS COSTING YOU BUSINESS --- if you want to be a comedian get out the restaurant business.. NICE FIRST IMPRESSION ! --NOT   At that point I knew this place is a disaster ( go with your gut) and she is not interested in quality customer service or friendly service. I despise shitty attitudes and unfriendly people AND dirty restaurants where  tables are empty and dirty and you have to sit next to them and eat your meal. Come on ,hire a damn busboy for $8 / hr ( I was one years ago), these high school kids want jobs to.. . This business thinks small and could care less about growing there business.

Plus the girls mom is in the back doing the cooking. There's just a sweet charm about that.  The waitresses are personable and usually remember a familiar face. They speak to each other in their native tongue, which adds to the ambience.  The rice and gyro platter is out of this world. So delicious!   Spanakopita for dessert is a must.",

    "text": "Love Eden's Grill.  Great basmati rice, all yellow which I'm hoping is ghee.  (unfortunately, I found out from the owner that it is saffron rice with \"vegetable oil\".  This usually means \"soybean oil'.  Since soybean it probably the cheapest and worst oil to use (endrine disruptor), that really makes me not want to frequent the place that often.)   The steak kabobs are awesome, seasoned with some herbs and not totally garlicy or spicy.    Very small place and hard to find in the corner of a shopping center (ACE Hardware) but well worth the trip.  The lunch portions are smaller and cheaper so get there before 4.  One day I was running really late and they had changed to dinner.  Wow, much bigger servings but of course, I ate it all!",

    "text": "I won't be back, sorry, but although I like middle eastern cooking, I don't like kebobs much.  Eden's Grill is essentially a kebob house - virtually all of the entries are combinations of four types: chicken, beef, lamb, ground beef.  And they are pretty good kebabs too, but I just don't like kebobs much.  I could quibble about the vegetables being underdone, nearly raw actually.  Or I could say the sauce container was so small that it was hard to dip pieces of meat in it.  The dinnerware was kind of flimsy.  It's a small place and you may have trouble walking in and getting a table sometimes.    The point is that Eden's does what it does competently and with no serious faults.  I just don't like kebabs enough to return.  But for anyone who does like them, four stars is fair.",

    "text": "A complete hole in the wall with awesome food! So I guess I wouldn't know what authentic Mediterranean food tastes like since I've never travelled there, but this seemed pretty dang authentic to me! The decor is simple and the restaurant is super small! But no need for fancy decor when the food is rockin. It is family owned, and we overheard a server talking about how her mom is the chef there. I love places like that! People working there were nice and showed a passion for the food. So we started off with hummus and wow it was tasty, had a great texture and flavor. I ate pretty much the whole thing haha. We asked for extra cucumber to dip in it too and that was good, plus they gave us a ton of pita, we brought home extra!  For my dinner I could not resist the falafel platter, though the veggie patty sounded tasty as well! My mom got a chicken skewer salad. Usually I pretty much inhale my meals, but the portions are both massive and filling! I recommend sharing a plate for sure, and I never recommend that usually haha. The falafel was different than what I'm used to but I liked it. I think more mushy on the inside than what I typically have, but it was good because it wasn't dry like some falafel is. Definitely some of the most flavorful falafel I've had. The rice with raisins and almonds was awesome too, could only eat like a forth of it. And the vegetable skewers! Loved those as well. My mom liked her food too, she had more than enough chicken left over. It is expensive, but you are getting two meals for one so Id say it's worth it!",

    "text": "I've been coming here for quite awhile now and was surprised by my review of this place. I love the family owned business. The mom and the brother is in the back as cooks, the older sister is the owner, and the younger sister is the hostess and waitress. They are all from Iraq and their food is all from the Middle East.   I've notice they've upgraded their place. Walls painted, nice new floor, with nice new table tops. They got rid of those gaudy pink table clothes. I really like their decor. A lot better than before.   We always order the potato cakes. It comes with three in an order, garnished with cucumbers, and tomato slices with a yogurt dipping sauce. It's so good. It's crispy on the outside with a meat filling on the inside. Put some of that yogurt sauce on it then I'm in heaven. To die for. Really like it as you can tell.   Me an my wife always order one dish and we split. It enough for two people. I could probably eat a whole dish but would be totally stuffed but sharing is perfect. Today we had the chicken and lamb kebab. It comes on a bed of rice with golden raisins and almond slivers with grilled vegetable which included green peppers, tomatoes, and onions. Lamb was so tender and chicken was so moist. Really good. Loved it. They used to give even bigger portions with about two or three scoops more of rice but their portions are just perfect. One thing is their prices stayed the same with smaller portions. Doesn't matter to me cause it's still enough for two. Just love the grilled lamb and chicken.   We've had their deserts before but not tonight even though they have some of the best deserts. They said they used to own a bakery back east and bake a lot of their deserts so if you have a chance try their deserts. You won't be disappointed.   So this place is small with about 10 to 12 tables. Very busy on the weekends. Great food and friendly service. Sometime they can get busy and sometimes come off as not being as friendly but the service is good. So trust me. I love this place and will for sure be back. Enjoy.",

You haven't had kabobs until you have had them here.  No, that's not trite--it's quite True.  Get your steak kabobs medium rare.  Do it. They are an experience to behold.  Even the basmati rice is remarkable.  3.  Imagine the most delicious, warm, rich apple pie you could ever have.  Now, project that richness of taste to a baklava.  You can have it here.  4.  No matter what you order here, you will love it.  Yes, you will.  Worth driving across the Valley to eat here.  Nuff said.",

    "text": "Absolutely best Mediterranean restaurant in AZ so far. The food is excellent, prepared well, authentic and very flavorful. The ladies that own it are welcoming, lively, funny and you feel like you are a guest in their home. I asked them to open a second location in Chandler-Gilbert area, but they said they couldn't, my heart broke a little. I will keep asking. The location is in an unassuming plaza, a little restaurant tucked in the middle. It gets busy and full quickly, especially at prime times.  Someone tell the owners to make a second location. We drive like an hour each way, if not more.   I grew up around Middle Eastern food, so I know my way around various versions of the popular dishes and this place is truly delicious. My husband and I go only a few times a year, because it is so far from us, but we love the food. I kinda feel like giving a bad review to deter new customers.   We get the large combo platters(either #1 or #2)for 2, for dinner. It is a ton of food. We might make it halfway, and have the rest for leftovers, which is still delicious. The rice and meats are awesome!  We got the Eden's Combination Appetizer Platter to share last visit.  It has; Dolmeh, Homous, Bab Ganoosh and Yogurt Cucumber Dip. I really wish it included falafel. I didn't love the yogurt dip.   * Update: We went last weekend on Saturday night, with another couple and the yogurt dip was good again and had lots of fresh herbs. The rice however wasn't as flavorful or toasty at all as previously tasted, super bummed. The chicken tasted well marinated but different than before. I prefer how it used to taste more grilled or smoky. The ground beef kabobs and gyro were excellent as always. Huge dinner portions, you definitely get more than you pay for!   Baklava is the best here, most authentic made with real butter. You can absolutely taste the difference. #baklavabomb  If you are looking for more budget friendly options, go for lunch. They have lunch specials and smaller plates(still good size portions) at very reasonable prices. My husband gets the Gyro lunch special and I will get that or a salad. We are gyro snobs, but these are super good.  They have plenty of tasty vegetarian dishes too, which is great.",

We both had the lamb and beef which was cooked to perfection and seasoned accordingly. We also shared the hummus as an appetizer; DO IT! We had leftovers for the next day which were just as good as the night before. I highly recommend Eden's Grill. Great food, great service.",

From the moment you walk in you're welcomed by a member of the family, usually the father who is working the dining room.  This hospitality lasts until you leave.  Their rice is truly a standout with almonds and raisins mixed in.  Hummus is amazing.  Chicken kabobs are always tender and juicy.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu here!  If you're nice to them, they might even give you a complimentary baklava for dessert!",

Hummous & babaganoush very tasty. We didn't know which one to choose so the waitress recommended half & half. Gyros come on a massive platter as well. The special for the night was Lamb Shanks with rice, raisins & almonds. It was so good!  Our 3 year old couldn't stop eating the rice!  We left stuffed and still had several to go boxes. The staff was friendly & accomodating. This is a small local eatery, make reservations if you want to eat in the evening at a certain time, it fills up fast.  Luckily we had arrived for a early dinner so they had room for our party of 6.  We'll be back to try other items on the menu and we will all be sharing next time!",

    "text": "Eden's Grill is, without question, home to some delicious, homemade Middle Eastern food. Not since going to the houses of friends of my father many years ago have I tasted food like this.   I should clarify...  There are great Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix, but a lot of the places have food that tastes like restaurant/deli food. This is not bad at all...restaurant food can be very delicious. But, then there are places that serve food the way \"Mom\" makes it. It's that special little bit of love that I'm talking about. In the case of Eden's Grill, \"Mom\" IS making the food. Well, not my mom, but the mom of the great waitress that served my table today (So sorry I didn't catch her name.).   For our lunch, Bobby T and I went for a side of hummus and baba, a gyro plate and a beef kebab sultani plate. The hummus and baba were solid, loaded with garlic and topped generously with olive oil. The gyro plate was also solid, the meat wasn't too dry and the veggies were definitely fresh. Above the previous two menu items stood the beef kebab sultani. Each bite had the two of us smiling because it was so good. The kebab meat had flavor infused into the core of each piece...never did I chew a bite and not get the flavor of the marinade. It was awesome. We also got to taste some of their hot dolma. I have only been served hot dolma at three restaurants, and each time they have been great; definitely worth trying if you're a dolma fan.  There is one last thing that we tried that everyone needs to come to Eden's Grill for though, and that is the rice - basmati w/ golden raisins and chopped almonds. The rice especially tasted like it was made with love and not just by a chef. I still crave it as I write this (good thing there was plenty left over).   I'm excited about this \"new\" find for me, and I think other Yelpers should be as well.",

    "text": "For some reason this restaurant shows up under two different places on Yelp!, so I figured I'd also review it under this entry as well.   Earlier this week, I made my first visit to this place on the advice of a colleague of mine, since it is nearby our workplace. I have to say it was beyond expectation in just about every way and I can't wait to go back again. I also can't believe what I've been missing all this time!   The decor and ambiance are both really nice, as the place is cozy, quaint and quiet but definitely not a hole in the wall. It doesn't feel at all pretentious or phony and is, in fact, about as authentic for Mediterranean food and surroundings as you're going to get in greater Phoenix.  Their lunch specials are all very well priced and everything I tried was absolutely delicious. I've also had their appetizers and the humus and baba are both exceptional. They also have a wonderful yogurt dip for your pita that is savory and spot-on. The gyro sandwich that I had was absolutely perfect, the tenderness, consistency and the portions were all spot on and flavor was wonderful.  The service was excellent, with refills never taking too long and food coming out faster than expected, both of which are huge pluses.  I really cannot recommend this place enough and if you're in the area you absolutely have to give it a try. I will definitely be back for lunch in the near future and maybe dinner as well.",

    "text": "I grew up in a Filipino family that bought rice in 50-lb bags, because we ate so much of it. If Eden's Grill is any indication, the people of the Mediterranean have very similar eating habits. They give you so much rice to accompany your meals that, if you're not an avid fan of rice like me, you might feel like you were getting ripped off because the rice portion dwarfs the entree portions. That's not to say you don't get a lot of entree -- it's just that most normal sized things look suddenly become diminutive in the presence of Eden's Grill's rice portions.  Luckily, the rice is amazing. I'm probably -- no, I AM biased towards the grain, but Eden's Grill deserves 5-stars on the rice alone. A lot of Mediterranean restaurants I've tried have a nasty tendency of over salting their rice. Often times, the resulting flavor is nearly indiscernible from Rice-a-Roni. Here, the flavor (curry, almonds, and raisins) is subtle, yet deep. I could eat a popcorn bucket of their rice and still crave more. I haven't had a single entree that wasn't delicious, but for me it's the rice that steals the show.   It's family owned, the amount of food you get for the money is ridiculous (their huge lunch specials have to be one of the best food deals around), and the food is superb. This restaurant is quickly becoming one of my favorites in Phoenix.",

Both were great but the Moroccan chicken was actually to die for! Portions are HUGE so expect to have leftovers the next day. (I believe it's $5 extra to split  something so just go with having leftovers you won't regret it) I'm not a leftover kinda girl but I hoarded these leftovers like you wouldn't believe. The owner is the cook and the daughter is the waitress. The sweetest women ever. The rest of the staff was fun too!  We had a party of 11 so it could have been a handful but they handled it well and made it fun!  Quick tip. ...the place is tiny so make a reservation if you have a large group. Our group of 11 took up half the restaurant.  :)",

Located in a strip mall, this little family owned/operated eatery serves some of the best food we've had.  The dolmas appetizer (stuffed grape leaves) were tasty, the Moroccan Chicken was very flavorful and the Gyros Plate was overflowing with perfectly seasoned meat.  Entrees include flavorful basmati rice studded with white raisins and almond slivers.  We dined with two other couples who also raved about their Vegetarian Platter, Adam and Eve Entree, Lamb Kebobs, and the Chicken Kebob/Gyros Entree.  Unlike most other restaurants, wine pours were almost to the top.  Prices were very reasonable and servings were very generous.  We all took home leftovers.  Noreen, the owner/server was friendly, perfectly attentive and responded to our questions regarding her culture.  We will definitely go back to Eden's Grill when we are in the mood for Mediterranean/Greek food!  We also advise making reservations as this place is generally very busy!",

The owner or manager was sitting at a table with a pile of bills yelling about how they charge too little and the bills are too high.   Like I said the food is good but with these other things going on in the front of the house, it makes me wonder what is going on in the back.

The food was unbelievably delicious and the portions are gigantic. We started with the falafel appetizer - very crispy and packed with flavors - served with tahini and pita bread. My husband got the lentil soup - I only had a few spoonfuls - but it was the best soup I have ever tasted in my life. I never knew I loved lentil soup?? LOL For entrees he got the lamb kabob salad and I got the chicken fillet kabobs. The meats were perfectly seasoned and not salty, which is something we are very particular about. What really knocked my socks off was the saffron rice with golden raisins and pine nuts that came with my chicken - holy cow - the most amazing rice dish I have ever had. I'll be dreaming about that rice until I go back! Service was prompt, courteous and friendly, even though they were very busy. I would highly recommend this awesome little gem to anyone!

I had the beef and lamb kebob combo.. very good! it was my first time having lamb and i prefered it over the beef kebab haha. The rice was good and the portion was a pretty good amount too. Would definitely come back if I am ever near by again! Not a five star cause I felt like she payed attention to the only other table that's was there and didn't come to my table that much til they had left but besides that everything was good! Would recommend this place!",

I thought she had an attitude when she answered that the chicken was different than falafel. (I knew that already. That was my way of asking what she recommended.)   I got the chicken gyro with Greek salad. The spices on the salad and the dressing were fantastic. I ate Greek salads throughout Greece though and I was hoping for fresh tomatoes, kalamata olives and fresh greens and feta.  Oh well. I'm not in Greece anymore.  The spices on the chicken and the way it was cooked was phenomenal! The onion and tomatoes and yogurt sauce all combined in a delicious melody of flavors I've missed for a while now.  The price of 8 dollars for lunch is great especially considering you can blow that on crap at Wendy's instead.  I think if the salad had blown me away and the decor was updated a bit, I'd give more stars.   Turns out, the server called me sweetie a few times so I guess I was wrong about feeling like she was rude.   I'm coming back for lunch soon and can't wait to give more stars if they serve me a great falafel!",

The choices are kind of limited. Seems like half the menu are kebabs, but they are so tasty.  If the prices look a bit high, the portions that come out justify that. The grilled meats rest on a huge plate of flavored rice. I can usually save half for lunch the next day.  Some of their desserts look tempting but I never have room for them. Maybe I will order some to take out next time.",

She offered us a drink right away and maintained an impressive level of service the entire time.   We started with the fatoush (sp?) salad which had the most amazing pita chips in it with a flavorful, fresh dressing. We then both ordered the Eden's Grill kabob plate which we loved, but were unable to finish.  The portions are very generous so we took the leftovers home to enjoy for lunch tomorrow.  It seems we are always on a quest for good Mediterranean food here, and we may have just found our go-to spot.   Welcoming atmosphere, friendly service, fresh and authentic food which I look forward to trying again and again.",

It comes with tzatziki & tahini sauce. YUM!!! It is enough food for 2 or 3 people.

Never disappointed with the general consensus of Yelpers.   Service was wonderful. It is a family owned business where they have pride in what they do.

    "text": "TL;DR - Great food, great value, great service.    I recently had a a dozen guests over for a birthday party.  I spoke with the owner and she helped me figure out the right amount of food for my group.  The \"platters\" on the menu are huge and each one easily serves 4 hungry adults.  They're a total bargain if you're looking to \"cater\" a party without hiring a fancy caterer.  The owner even let me customize what I got on my platters and she definitely gave me heaping servings.  Most amazing of all, the owner came in on a Sunday (when the restaurant is closed!) just so she could make my platters.  She wanted to make sure I had her food fresh for my party on Sunday instead of warming it up after picking up the day before.  Unprecedented!!  The food was terrific.  Each platter came with choice of meats (again, plenty for four adults) a massive helping of rice, four veggie kabobs and several different sauces.  Lots of times gyro meat is underseasoned or just tastes salty.  Here, the meat was well seasoned and tasted like lamb.  We also got the hummus, baba ganoush, and dolmahs, all of which were significantly better than we get at Pita Jungle.",

Portion size they were huge. I probably could have gotten just a soup and been full. The gyros were pretty good, but the thing that threw me for a great loop was the rice. It was served with raisins and almonds and it made it spectacular. Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "My wife and I dined here last night.  It was dead.  We were there for about an hour and were the only people there.  A few people came and went for pickup orders but that is it.  It was like our own private dining room.  We were assured by the owner that during the winter months the place is almost always jam packed with snowbirds.  From the looks and deadness of the place I was skeptical of the food/service but I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was awesome and so was the service.  The owner was friendly and an all around awesome lady.  To start we had baba ganoosh and hummus.  Both were very good and the pitas were ok but not house made.  Then we had a small house salad and lentil soup.  The lentil soup was excellent but the salad was just ok.  The dressing was 'eh and weird and I really can't describe it.  However, for a small salad, it was huge.  For my main course I ordered the lamb and gyro dish.  The lamb was tender and juicy and the gyro was the best I've ever had.  The portion was huge too which was good because I was able to eat the rest for lunch the next day.  My wife had the falafel salad.  The actual salad part was just ok (like the house salad I ordered previously) but the falafel were excellent.  It was also a very big portion.  For desert we brought home some baklava.  It was homemade and very good although not as sweet as I would have liked.    All-in-all it was a very good dining experience and we will return.",

    "text": "A tiny strip mall located family owned business.  For those who know anything about valley food; that means you're usually going to find something great.  If you like Mediterranean, there's something at Eden's Grill Inn that will satisfy your taste buds.  I've had a few of Eden's Grill's platters at a party before, but this weekend was my first dining experience at the restaurant.  The dining room is small.  Probably not much bigger than my living room, but they manage to comfortably squeeze a good mount of tables in without it getting uncomfortable.  Some music (I'm assuming Greek) gives the place some added feeling.  The decor isn't much.  A few paintings and a lot of the clique \"Best\" whatever they were vote from the New Times or some other publications plaque's.  Those awards seem to be well deserved.  We both had the gyro pita lunch special.  For just $7.95, you get the sandwich, a choice of Greek salad, fries, or rice, and a drink.  When the sandwich arrived, I was shocked at the massive amount of meat.  I had to start with a fork just to eat it down to a size where I could use my hands and take a bit!  The tzatziki sauce is also excellent.  I'm guessing they mix some sort of sour cream in with the yogurt.  Whatever it is, it makes the sauce very flavorful.  The pita bread may be the best I've ever had.  It's almost more of a hybrid or a naan and a pita.  A little oily for bread, but delicious.  The service was as good as the food.  The owner really made us feel welcome, and was as nice as can be.  The lunch specials are cheap.  The regular entrees can be pretty pricy.  But portions are pretty big, so it's best to come here with a group of at least four and split a few items.",

    "text": "OK after hearing about this restaurant from a friend I decided to take the family out. First I must say that living in the valley for over 30 years I still and always will be a Haji Baba fan in Tempe Az. for life!(yelp them)  So, walk in and would agree that the ambiance was less than. Dinner tables were cheap and the table cloth was tacky. Oh almost forgot why is there a large mirror on the wall? Were given dinner menus by a impolite waitress who I suspected was surely going to be the owner. The first thing that hit was the prices! $$$ I kindly asked the waitress if I could just have a Gyro sandwich. The answer was NO! (rudely). Those are only available during lunch time! Ok, so next option was to gamble on a gyro plate priced at $14.95. We placed our order and waited. The food arrived on a timely manner. The food was hot and looked good. The tzatziki-sauce was a 10! Although the gyro meat was not to my tasting, it was ok for being real hungry. Eventually the waitress started warming up to us! :)   PROBABLY WONT RETURN AGAIN.  Pros- Fresh food, Location  Cons-Couldn't get what I really wanted.(A gyro sandwich)  -$$$ pricey! $36 for 2 adults and 2 children. (2 gryo plates and a coke.)  -No kids menu.   -Water tasted like it was from the tap.  -Coke was flat.",

Don't expect corporate luxury and professional interior design.  -Waitstaff are family, and they may have made some of your food earlier in the day. they are friendly, but not professional servers.

    "text": "Well very disappointed in food and especially service! I was very excited to check it out as I like this type of food and it's close to my house and it got great reviews otherwise.  Waitress was kind of short & unfriendly to say the least. We ordered and I had a chicken salad. Upon commencement of eating I came upon what looked like an unwashed lettuce.. I carefully inspected it and moved it aside dismissing the possibility... Very soon after I found another piece of unwashed lettuce (romaine) right after a slight feeling of sand in my mouth, now truly inspected it - sure enough it looked like dirt that has not been washed of produce (just like when you buy loose lettuce at the grocery store); decided I had enough (I hardly got any progress on the food). I let the waitress know and she proceeded to convince me it was the salad dressing (because I guess I don't know the difference). Then as she took the plate, she said: \"you should have told me sooner\". WTF?? What does it even mean? I said: \"no, it should have been washed!\" At that point I was fed up with the unfriendliness and I kind of forcefully rebuffed her.  I haven't ordered anything aft that. They brought soup as a means of settling it all down (as I mentioned I liked the soup because my parents ordered the soup as an appetizer which they didn't like but I did so I ended up eating it). I declined but said I would take pistachio ice cream (they only had 2 on the menu - vanilla & pistachio). Well, pistachio ice cream ended up being vanilla ice cream with few ground pistachios on top of it.. I mean I don't even know what to say. When I read pistachio ice cream I expect pistachio ice cream just like vanilla or chocolate or strawberry. It wasn't worth arguing. I will not be coming back to this place and it's a shame because I really like mediterranean food.",

We had just finished up and were deciding on desert when 3 women accompanied by three young children came in.   The kids ran up and down the aisles yelling loudly.  None of the women made any attempt to control them.  When the kids started going in and out of the entrance door, the owner came out of the back and asked them to stop because the door was heavy and she didn't want them to catch their fingers - an injury that might make the restaurant liable.  Other than that, she stayed in the back rather than ask the women to control their children   Those unruly kids ruined our lunch - which cost us around $40.  We couldn't even hear ourselves speaking and wound up leaving earlier than we would have otherwise. Obviously the owner cared enough to speak up when it concerned liability for her business but not when her customers were being inconvenienced.",

Some of the ladies you encounter are cold and unfriendly, and don't seem to appreciate their customers at all.  It almost seems like they could care less you are there and don't do anything to make you want to come back. There is one woman who seems to be the only one who can render a smile at all, but I don't know her name. Recently I even had an issue with being overcharged and all that was said was 'sorry, I already ran your card'. What?  So cancel the charge and rerun or find some other way to make it good, but no, nothing was said or done. Thankfully it was a small amount, but it was the principal of the behavior exhibited that upset me most.  The food is still above average which is the ONLY reason I still go there. It is a teeny tiny little place in a strip mall.  You are going for the food only if you go, definitely not the missing atmosphere or customer service.",

I wish they included more than one of the soft fluffy pitas. There were some other pitas but may have been for another dish we got.  Also definitely needed the extra gyro sauce we ordered.  The Moroccan chicken was tasty and had a little kick.  I really liked the kefta kebab.  Great flavor but I have had some that were a little more tender other places.  The portions were huge for everything except the kefta.  Not as big of a portion for the price.  We won't hesitate to return soon and often.",

If you do go on a date here, or if you generally want to speak to anyone after eating here, you may want to pack a toothbrush and mouthwash.  Hellooooo garlic!!!      Don't get me wrong, I love me some garlic, but consider yourself forewarned!!    That goodnight kiss could turn evil real quick, so if you want a second or third date, pack your breathmints!  =)   We split a plate for 2 which was the beef, lamb and chicken.  We both thought we just ordered the beef and chicken, so the lamb was a little bonus.  And I'm glad, because the chicken and the lamb were definitely the best!   While the order says it's for 2 - it's actually probably a portion for 4 - 5 people.   We ate until full and then took two to-go boxes.  I ate it for lunch and dinner the next day.  I'm STILL oozing garlic from my pores.   The saffron rice was delish.   Servers were non-invasive, but still attentive and friendly.  Loved the neighborhood vibe here - people walked in and were obviously regulars, there was a big birthday party going on, overall just a nice, relaxed vibe.  Great for a date or for families.",

But this place is INCREDIBLE. \"Eden Grill\" is an amazing family owned, family chef, family service staff. What that translates to for me is \"THEY ALL CARE\" and it truly shows. The food was just perfect. We each (4) had a different dish, and each and every dish was great. My only issues is it's a 6 hour drive from my house to the Eden Grill!!",

In keeping with my rule of only reviewing if I feel that a place is a 1 or a 5, I'm pleased to give this place a 5.  First, Nora was fantastic. She is kind and funny, but mostly, it's so neat to see how proud she is of her family and their restaurant.  She's proud for good reason. Food is truly great and very reasonable. We stared with the potato cake and it was awesome. Nora brought the legit hot sauce which went perfect with the cucumber sauce on the potato cake. Then we had a giant platter of gyros, lamb and chicken kabob.... Ridiculous. The platter was accompanied by a big plate of rice with fresh raisins.  Normally I'd think I wouldn't like sweet raisins with my rice, but it was terrific.  Couple of cocktails and great company. Can't say enough about this little family owned spot. Great job. We look forward to being regulars!",

The ground beef kabob is nothing short of spectacular.  In many places, that dish is an afterthought but not here.  Their house rice is an aromatic yellow rice with almonds and raisins and absolutely delicious.  It's also a proper restaurant - not your typical gyro lunch counter vibe.  Lunch for two runs $17.00 and we usually take food home.  Everyone I've brought here loves it.  Highly recommended!",

I've lived in the North Phoenix area forever and somehow never even knew this place existed until last night when I was scouring yelp for a new dinner option. It's tucked in the corner of a nondescript strip mall and from the outside looks pretty bland. Inside, it's a nice quaint restaurant with one wall dedicated to all the awards they've won over the year. Our server could tell it was our first time and explained they've been open for 10 years, that he and his sister are the servers and his mom and aunt are the chefs. We ordered a small house salad to split, the adam & eve (beef and chicken kebabs in greek marinade) and the moroccan chicken. Everything was fantastic, especially the rice that comes with the dishes. Portions were HUGE and I can't wait to have my leftovers for dinner again tonight. It wasn't cheap but not terribly expensive either ($15-$20 per entree). We'll be back for sure.",

My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet.",

I was doubtful of the rice at first- saffron, cinnamon, toasted almonds and golden raisins- but it all worked. The hummus was heavy on the tahini and super creamy.

The chicken was alright but again nothing to write home about. The rice was pretty good.  I've had better and I've had worse. The prices are a little on the higher side ($15ish a dish), which I wouldn't have minded if the food was better.  Some yelpers complained about the service which I found to be pretty good. The family seemed nice and attentive.    I probably won't be back since there are a few other Mediterranean restaurants that I enjoy more",

    "text": "Sincerely,  Uninspired in Phoenix  I've had Eden's Grill Bookmarked for a while now, seeing as I do enjoy a good gyros and today I happened to be just round the corner and hungry. I pulled up Yelp, went to my bookmarks, low and behold a nearby 4.5 star! I quickly decided, \"That's where were going\" and away we went.   Now many of my reviews come from inspiration, something seems to catch my attention. Maybe it was the amazing house made ketchup, perhaps the superior service, or the cooked to perfection polenta. Inspiration sometimes comes also from a crude wait staff, under cooked chicken, or runny macaroni and cheese. Today, I find no inspiration and thus, this spot gets filed as Vanilla. Not quite one of my favorites, but an OK choice if it's easily accessible and no alternative choices to speak of.  Upon arrival the wait staff seemed to be hours deep into a game of poker. Showing neither excitement nor distain to see me enter the dining room, they certainly had an amazing poker face. \"Two?\" she asked, then escorted us to one of the eight available tables in a dining room of ten tables.   $7.95 for a gyros and (salad, fries, or rice) seemed like a square deal to me, so I ordered up a \"gyros with a salad - and please, no onions or tomato.\" I knew I could break that poker face of her's; although, I didn't expect it to be in offense to me wanting no tomato on my food. It's rare I get asked \"you want no tomato?... on your salad!?\" with a sneering look of offence, as if my personal distain of tomatos somehow reflected poorly on her or the kitchen staff.   Sadly, the salad; having fresh lettuce, cucumber, and a \"barely there\" amount of feta cheese - just enough to \"call it out\" on the menu as an included ingredient, was bland. Adding salt and pepper to a salad is never a sign of a good salad or dressing. Along comes the gyros, and tasty as it was, the gyros meat was sliced super thin - no problems if you like it that way though, and it was also topped with the onions I specifically requested to be omitted from my meal; I quickly picked those off myself.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe it's just me be picky, maybe there were forces at work here that wanted my meal to be \"pretty good, but uninspired\", but this 4.5 star place seemed a little over stated, IMHO. It's possible I'll come back again, but hailing from central phoenix, it's rare I'm up this way, and more rare I'm up here and looking for something to eat.  Happy Yelping Phoenix.",

I was wearing  my Chicago Cubs T-shirt and lady hostess greeting with a nice friendly greeting and said they were good like the Chicago gyros.   We both had the gyro sandwich and they were great. Loaded ,heaping with gyro meat and great Tziki sauce. (Spelling?).  Anyway, they came several times to check on us, asked how we liked it and genuinely seemed pleased to serve us. Very reasonably priced. They Said they originally came from a Chicago and pride themselves on having the same quality products.  Very pleased and will definitely return.",

I watched plates being delivered to customers. not only did they look good and smell wonderful, but the portions were huge! I definitely over ordered. Got our order, went back to hotel and though there was only 3 of us we had enough food for 6!  Yay, leftovers! Fortunately we had full kitchen at hotel. Everything we ordered was great. Beef and chicken kabobs cooked perfectly, rice really good. Potato cakes saved for breakfast-yum. Salad, hummus, baba ganoush- all very good. Highly recommend this restaurant.",

The Moroccan chicken entree is also very good --- the menu says spicy, but that refers only to the use of lots of fragrant spices.  The portions are large and always leave enough for a meal the next day.  We have brought friends and relatives and never had a complaint. Visit this local favorite now!",

So I knew I wanted that, and once my Sis tasted it she wanted it, we ended up sharing my plate (we came hungry, shared my plate, and still had a little left, the portions are huge). It was one of the best things she has ever had and wants to come back every time she comes to visit.  The fish is not just cooked perfectly, it is seasoned so well, it doesn't have a hint of \"fishy\" taste. The rice is perfect with it.

I have experienced amazing service and a 1000 TIMES BETTER tasting food at 'Mijana' and 'Persian Room' with much better pricing and portions. Please read this fully before giving this place a try! Firstly, when my sister walked in she was met by a miserable, disgruntled woman at the counter, not even a friendly welcoming. After ordering she asked if she could keep some menu's on the table because two family members were not present yet - she took them away without giving her a choice. The food delivered WAS COLD. At the end of our dining, she was pushing us to hand over the plates/drinks all the way across the 3 tables, towards her to clean up (mind you we were way before closing time, still having a lovely family chat and she was rushing us for no reason - no other customers were waiting for tables). To make matters worse, she sat in the corner staring at us with a moody face. When we finally were ready to leave because we kept feeling the pressure to do so, we stood up and the one waitress that is \"large framed\" (to put it politely) with glasses almost pushed my sister out of the way while saying \"I need to clean, I need to go home!\" Mind you, there were still two other people in the restaurant however they decided to treat us this way. Again, terrible service and sadly I cannot even say \"at least the food was worth the $300 tab\".",

The pita bread is fresh and the portions served are huge. You rarely see a party leaving without at least one or two containers of leftovers. Many regulars evident. There is a small outdoor dining area. Not sure if its dog friendly, but I suspect it may be only reluctantly.  I don't care for the five dollar fee to split an entre. Most dinner entrees are about fifteen bucks and the serving sizes are large, so sharing is a rationale approach for all but the most robust of appetites. Also don't expect a warm welcome if you try to order portions of the menu al a carte. I think it's fine to bring your kids here, but I don't sense that kids are encouraged. They did throw in extra pita bread upon request with our leftovers on a recent visit. Nice. Any complaints are really very minor in comparison to the strengths of the restaurant.   This small family owned and operated establishment is definitely worth experiencing.",

The food was fresh, well seasoned, and the portions were generous. I ended on a sweet note, with the baklava. The layers of phyllo dough were flaky, and it wasn't overly sweet, which is a good thing. A lot of times it can be soggy and super sweet. This wasn't, it was perfect. I can't wait to go back.",

We ordered a nice bottle of red wine, the dolmeh for an appetizer, Paul had the lamb kababs and I had the  Eden's grill chicken.

The soup was ok but from people around the table it sounded like the lentil soup was the way to go. The veggie pattys were absolutley delish and the rice was really good too. The only problem with Eden's is the space in the restaurant, it gets super crowded and, if you're sitting at the end of the table like I was, you get bumped a ton.

The chicken kabobs were moist and flavorful.  I think the golden raisin and almond topped rice was amazing.  I'm not big on starches, but I ate much more than I would have elsewhere.  Speaking of eating more...wow, the portions are perfectly plentiful and satisfying.  You definitely get what you pay for at this restaurant.

The rice is EPIC with delicious almonds and dried fruits - we are picking up a platter for our Thanksgiving feast year. I always feel at home here at Eden's Grill Inn (so much so that the family knows me by name here now!)

    "text": "Absolutely love this restaurant, and for so many reasons . . .   First, it is family owned (always like to support the little independents), and the owners are so nice and friendly (more on that below) . . .   Secondly, the food is awesome and portions are generous. The hummus is heavenly. The babaganoush is brilliant. The dolmas, delightful. And that's just for starters.   Here's what tipped the scales way in their favor . . .   We stopped in on a lark on a Tuesday night to order take-out. Just as we placed our order for the combination appetizer plate and the kefta and chicken combo entree, the wife came out of the kitchen to serve a couple nearby. The scent of the entree as it passed by was perfume to my nose and senses. I asked, \"what was that?\" The owner enthusiastically replied, \"We are serving Passover dinner this week, and that's our brisket.\" \"Oh my, I said. That smelled so incredible.\" The wife of a couple seated next to us said, \"it is the best I have ever had.\" As a Jewish girl, growing up on the best brisket ever made, only by my mother, that was a throwdown for me to try some. The owner asked me if I want to try some. I think he noticed that my eyes were popping out of their sockets and a little drool was coming out of my mouth. \"Oh yes!\" He proceeded to serve me a nice-sized slice of brisket which he said mother cooked over eight hours. It was as delicious as I remembered my mother's to be and ordered an entire entree to take home. Then, I said, \"it's missing only one thing . . . horseradish . . . \" To my surprise, the wife said to wait, she had some in the kitchen. I couldn't wait to get up and gobble up more of the fragrant and perfectly cooked to perfection brisket. That's the upside . . . the down side is that it's not on the menu any other time of the year . . .   That being said, our other entree was equally worth returning for the other 51 weeks. Not to be forgotten is their rice chock full of raisins and almonds which accompanies the entrees.   I can't believe that it took me five and a half years to find this place. I can't wait to go back for more!",

We have eaten in many times and taken out as well. This is the only place we go for our Gyros fix and mediterranean cuisine. P.S. The homous was too die for!!!",
