We didn't even make it in the door because someone in our party was wearing Nike basketball shoes. This is Mill Ave, first, there is no dress code. Second, he was very nicely dressed. Third, in a party of ten people, he was the only non-Caucasian. We feel this was extremely racist, as other people wearing \"sneakers\" were being admitted. We won't be returning to El Hefe on Mill anytime soon. This treatment is ridiculous, unfair, and unnecessary.",

The duck was by far my fav. Corn and fries were amazing. Think more sweet than spicy. Another guy next to me had the huge salad while his friend had the hefe dog.  Think they left happy too. The ladies couldn't have been more attentive. Only 'bad' thing was pretty average tap selection, when other places around offer more local. I think this place has definately made our lunch rotation.",

Toilets weren't clean and no paper in any of the 5 restrooms. Asked to speak to a manager and told he wasn't on site. Been here a few times. Seems the place is going downhill fast.

When confronted, she said she had no way to fix the error. Whatever ... That was annoying. My friend requested salsa and when told she had to pay for it, she made a genuinely confused face. The waiter (different one) said awkwardly \"you don't have to look at me like that.\" It was a weird vibe killer. Moving on Food : bad. Had a Torta that was overly sweet. No free chips , you pay for salsa. Tacos were weird too. One tortilla, no salsa to put on them.  But the cardinal sin here is when she offered to get me a beer, she lagged because she was busy flirting with men around. Listen sister, we had a long, hot ass day in Arizona. The least you could do is get me a cold beer, on time so I can drink while my friends are eating. Not chug a beer before we have to run.  + one star for the bartender who spoke to me and gave me a discount. Really nice guy. I wish the food could save this experience, but that was not worth the money either. ) :",

The management has always been great and I have had good service from many of the staff who have come, gone, and even come back. The food is good and lately one bartender, Emily,  has stood out with her service. She always make you feel welcome and is quick to get you your drinks. Even when all the bar seats are full she makes sure you are taken care of. I've not only witnessed this toward myself but also to other customers. This place is always worth the visit.

    "text": "I come here all the time since I live next door, its always the same. The bartenders and servers all have ego/attitude problems. They have these douchebag promoters that are always there doing seemingly nothing. Seriously there is not one employee that is happy or friendly, they all think they are a god.   When I come here I know what I am getting myself into but there is one incident that has pushed me over the edge. On a completely packed Saturday night I ordered drinks after fighting the crowd to the bar. All was well until the bartender accidentally dropped my credit card in the trashcan under the bar. Okay no big deal, he can reach in and grab it right? Nope, he refused to give it back to me and said I would have to come back tomorrow and get it. I still cannot believe he said that. I was trying to be nice about the situation but he was a complete dick. I brought only my card and ID out, so how am I supposed to buy anything else that night, as well as this was the end of finals and I had a flight home the next day! So finally he got one of the barbacks to take the trashcan outside of the definitely above fire code capacity bar, get my card, and bring it back. This took just over 30 min just standing there. When I got the card back he said he would buy me a drink, awesome, so I'm waiting for the drink and he keeps taking other peoples orders and skips me. After 10 min I was like are you ignoring me or something? He didn't say anything but finally gave me my drink and I left.  I hate this place with a passion. Whats strange is the Scottsdale location is much friendlier, and you would think it to be opposite. They need to change their management and give their staff an attitude adjustment. No one wants a bartender/server who has a stick up their ass.",

Unfortunately, the service here is very slow. The server didn't come around enough. We started with an appetizer of chips and salsa. There was no extra charge for the big, long hair that came in the pile of chips. That was gross. Had to wait for someone to come around to ask for a new plate of chips. The food looked good when it was served, but we had no utensils. We asked the food runner, but he never was to be seen again. Hubby had to get up and go to the bar to get us napkins and utensils.  Food was better than expected for a bar.  Clearly this place works off of alcohol sales, because the girls were gorgeous, but the service sucked. I wouldn't recommend coming here to eat, but if you want to drink and have lots of eye candy, this is the place.",

    "text": "Is \"macho\" supposed to mean that you don't know how to cook so you go on the cheap to feed people either bland, tasteless, re-heated frozen food or put so much sugar in it that you hope they won't notice it and then charge them way too much for it?  If so, El Hefe in Tempe has nailed it!  First, I have to say that I work right next door to this location. I've seen the transformation from Canteen to El Hefe and honestly, I don't get it.  Canteen fit pretty well into the surrounding shops while having a unique store front appearance.    El Hefe, on the other hand, is this massively gaudy, wood and steel behemoth that has overextended their boundaries.  They've stretched their front patio space nearly out onto Mill avenue and their back patio has been extended almost over into the neighboring Five Guys and Jimmy Johns.  It's obnoxious.  As for the food, it is mediocre to bad.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were thin and well salted, but slightly stale.  These were accompanied by three salsas, a super sweet tomatillo (my coworker actually asked if there was relish in it), a pico de gallo that was okay - but needed some salt, lime and time to come together, and a red salsa that quite honestly didn't taste like anything.    I myself had the chicken tinga tacos with their \"green cilantro rice\".  The rice tasted like something you'd get at the grocery store in a bag or box and just add the parboiled (minute) rice and seasoning mix to boiling water to make.  Nasty.  The chicken tinga tacos were just okay, having a hint of chorizo to them, but also very sweet to the point of overpowering any flavor of chicken that you might be hoping for.  This is exacerbated by their tacos in general being quite small (about 4\" across).  I also noticed that the consistency from one taco to the next was quite off.    My co-worker had an assortment of tacos.  The carne asada taco he quite liked.  The fish taco tasted \"old\" to him, indicating that the single chunk of battered fish was likely straight from the freezer.  The pork al pastor taco was so sweet that he actually didn't finish it, stating it was one of the worst taco's he's ever had.  So.. seven small taco's, about a cup and a half worth of green minute rice with some cilantro in it, chips and salsa (which if I overheard correctly, they charge for salsa refills) and two waters came out to just under $30.  For two lunches that didn't satiate either of us.  Needless to say, we won't be returning.",

Tacos are only $2 on Tuesdays, and if you sign up for their weekly texts there are additional offers (this week is two for one salads).  The service is also pretty friendly and accommodating.  I called ahead on a previous visit so we wouldn't have to wait for a table on a Saturday evening for dinner.  When we arrived the hostess had gone above and beyond to secure a table away from the noisy bar area with room for a stroller for us since my sister was bringing her infant daughter.  I do wish they had high chairs but we managed.  The server also had our bill to us at 6:30 on the dot, cards already run, as we requested so we would be on time to Gammage for our show.  We definitely will continue to come back.  We've also been to the one in Old Town, but the Mill Ave location is more convenient for us and is a great weekday lunch spot.  Oh, and in response to another reviewer with a chip on his shoulder I'm NOT an employee, just someone who loves a good deal that will stretch my dining out dollars (if you check my Linked In profile you'll see I work in insurance a few miles away).",

Those bribes are considered \"tips\" by the bald security guy with a long beard who says he is apparently the manager. If you asked them what they are doing they flip you off and look the other way.  Not sure if they don't know the bathroom is not considered a service. The service would be something the establishment provides that you pay for and that you can actually get tipped on. Using the restroom and waiting in line for it is not a service to get tipped on. Besides good music I suggest you don't drink and try to go to the restroom. Below is the guy who accepts bribes and flipped me off. Good luck!",

Nice to see a decent give away for a check in. The guac was great. Chip are thin like I em. Appeared to be made fresh. Ordered a steak and a chicken street taco. Not very big but about the norm for a gourmet taco. Chicken was shredded and in a type of sweet sauce. Was yummy. Both were good but not awesome. The service was was great. Was checked on by multiple people. I think they are making an effort to fix customer service issues. My visit wasn't during rush hour.

    "text": "Honestly if I could give this nasty bar ZERO stars I would. A group of us girls went out last night and stopped in here around 12:30. We grabbed drinks and started dancing. Some gross guy creeps up behind my friend and literally starts trying to bone her, she gives us the 'save me' face, so we pull her towards us. This guy apparently can't take rejection so he sucker punches my friend, A GIRL, in the face resulting in the black eye pictured below. He also elbows the girl he was trying to dance on in the nose causing an immediate bloody nose in the middle of the dance floor. So much commotion and not ONE bouncer is around, not one comes to see anything. Random people had to pull the guy away from trying to hit me as well. My poor friend runs to the bathroom with blood down her white shirt and running out of her nose and the bouncer there didn't even turn his head. I followed the creepy woman beater to the bathroom to try to stop him, but he practically shoves me to the ground and runs out. I told the security guards at the door and they literally did nothing until I started yelling that this bar let's woman beaters in and making a scene because literally NO ONE would help us out. Only then did they ask me for a description. Still didn't ask about my friend bleeding right in front of them. It's not like we're big tough girls either. My friend who got punched is tiny like 115 and I'm not much bigger. When this creep over 200lbs sucker punches a girl in the face, what should I do?!?!? What is the point of having security if you do nothing?!?! I called to try to speak with the manager multiple times today as my other friend may have a broken nose and they both would like to press charges if the asshole could be identified. I left my name and number because \"he was in a meeting, but he'll call you right back\" with no reply what so ever. OF COURSE. I should have called the cops last night, but at that point I just wanted to get my friends home since one of them still had blood gushing out of her nose. Although it wasn't this bars fault that that \"boy,\" we'll call him, is a complete piece of shit, but the way they handled the situation was sickening. This place is an absolute disgrace and clearly gives two shits about any kind rights for women. I'll never step foot in here again.",

    "text": "You all knew it was coming down the bend eventually... El Jefe must review El Hefe.   ~Fud/Drink~ I have not eaten here yet. It to me, looks like pizzaz filled gringo-ized Mexican that you'd come to expect at a douchey bar started up by bro's from Scottsdale. Just skimming through the menu it just exemplifies how many horrible Mexican food options we actually have here in Arizona. Its like all the American-Style Chinese places around each corner, same-ol-same-ol.   With that said, the drinks were tasty. I had two separate margaritas here, the best being the House Margarita. I enjoyed the flavors which were balanced between sweetness, crispness, and booziness. I do not enjoy paying $12 however, for a margarita...If I want to spike up my hair, get my surfer voice on, pop my collar and head down to a bangin' club in Scottsdale, now we're talking. But here, on Mill? Nope, I'd rather go to a couple other places for that type of coin. But then again, flavors mixed well...  ~Atmosphere/Service~ The atmosphere is what earns this place the bulk of its stars. It transitions better than the bulk of restaurants I have seen: From a day-bar, to a lunch spot, into a pre-club spot, and finally into a full-out nightclub. Good for them, the chameleon thing works really well. I happened to enjoy the latter two versions quite well with a few of my friends, with music blaring loud as can be into the heat of the night just a few weeks back. The DJ was no slouch, dropping some good mixes and allowing the booze to influence my white boy dance moves well.    Service is quite poor here, however. All of the girls are just there for eye-candy. They dance on top of the bar and seating areas once it transitions into a nightclub, and seem to not fully care that this is their job during the other portions of the night. One of the girls tending for me literally was on her phone, looked up at me and smiled as I looked onward asking for another, and then back down at her phone. About 15 seconds later she said she was sorry and got caught up with a friend, and then made me my drink. That's so lame, and exactly the type of service you expect from this place. No suggestions should be asked for, just don't do it...I doubt they really know their own menu quite well.  ~The Downlow/Extras~ No extras...reall simply put: Did you see how there are pros and cons to everything here? It's give and take, and I should not need to expect that from a place where I am spending a good amount of money. Plus, they spelled Jefe wrong....I mean, you are in Arizona, spell it right. This place tries to be The Boss, but they are barely that. They get 2 stars for the nightlife atmosphere and a  1/2 star which is rounded up for solid drinks. They lose a star for shit service and an over-priced douche menu. Would I go back? Yes...but that's after I have had a bunch elsewhere and then walk on in here to enjoy maybe one drink and the DJ music. Otherwise I will leave this for stupid ASU frat boys who can't get their oversized skateboard out to the Scottsdale location.",

All of the staff is incredibly nice and they have great music here too. I also love the fact that there's tons of monitors everywhere so you can see games from every angle of the venue.

We ordered chips and salsa, tacos and margaritas. The chips and salsa didn't come out until after we had finished our tacos. Aren't appetizers suppose to come out first? Then when we received our drinks, my friends drink had a hair in it, disgusting. Besides the fact that the tacos took forever we ordered a side of regular fries and they come back with carne asada fries. Overall service sucked and it wasn't even that busy.

When I see people in suits and dress attire lunching in a restaurant with servers in shorts with butt cheeks hanging out, it's awkward and tacky. You would think that for El Hefe providing a full menu and bar for both day and night, there is a time and place for how you present yourself for various settings, but it was laughable witnessing what I could easily see in a night out at old town during the day.   I came in during lunch hour. It was not rushed/busy/etc. But you can tell there were a decent amount of guests lunching during their lunch break from work. Our waitress had a really hard time cracking a smile and could not fathom expressing the slightest friendliest tone. My girlfriend and I were actually laughing at the face expression she had when she advised us our food is on it's way as if it was a huge convenience actually doing her job. I haven't seen anything this comical in a business standpoint in years.   The tacos I had were not that great. Unfortunately, the 2 carne asada tacos I tasted were room temp, stiff cold un cooked/warmed tortillas with bland flavor. I did, however, enjoy the fried avocado taco. I barely ate my third taco. I was not impressed and therefore hungry a little later and had an early dinner.  I would say my experience is better in the nighttime where hot bartenders are slinging drinks at a fast pace, great music, crowd etc. But during the day time, it was a blah experience. I loved the environment, to which all the windows were open and you got to enjoy the daylight,fresh air, etc. So the environment is great, but vibe is just okay. Perhaps it was just my first day time experience, but it could have been better.",

El Hefe does not fit any of the negatives you frequently hear about bars in mill. The food they have to offer is off the charts, I highly recommend trying the avocado taco even if it may seem a bit different. It is absolutely amazing. I have never ordered something here that I did not like. The service both bar and dining setting are above and beyond. Both the food and drinks pretty much come out as soon as the \"tender\" of your service has gone to enter them. On Fridays is when I love going in with my friends as they ironically have a \"friends on Friday\" deal. Half off their killer bulldog-garita, and select $2 tacos. Can't beat it. Night life at this spot is the exact same minus the food, still exceptional service even with a huge wall to wall crowd. They also sometimes bring out a taco cart on the patio for super late night with great food before you hit the road home for the night. Would highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "Where do I start? Went here on New Year's Eve. Got there fairly early cause we had a big group and wanted to secure a table on the patio. Was sitting there and like around after 9 'o clock a security gaurd comes over and says they are taking away our table. We explained that's why we got there early, the security guard said it's out of his hands his manager told him to. We asked to speak to the manager and another security gaurd came over. We asked for a refund on the guys cover charges since it was shitty that they were taking away the table. He was rude and laughed and said that's not going to happen, and that we can get a table for $1,200. We said well you shouldn't have had this table here on NYE so people think they can sit at it and then take it away when it's full. We agreed to leave the bar and as one of the guys in our group goes to push in his chair surrounded by 4 security gaurds he touches one the gaurds with the chair as he's pushing it in and the guard shoves him and then all 4 guards take one guy down and pull him off the property line and start punching him. Not a fair fight. They detain him and the one gaurd starts reading Him his rights. I said excuse me your not a cop you don't have the fight to do that. He said that he was a cop for 5 years so yes i can. I said well your shirt says security not PD so you don't have that authority to do so. He was threatening that he was going to jail. Again your security you can't determine that.  All in all the security was on a power Trip and like to play by their rules and the other staff wasn't friendly either. If I could give 0 stars I would but I have to leave one.",

    "text": "I can mostly understand the draw of El Hefe as a goto for ASU students.  Big expansive sports bar with a lengthy drink menu and friendly staff.  That said, eating here can feel like eating at Hooters (except with Mexican as the food theme).  Take that depiction however you wish, but I'm sure you can conjure up the appropriate (or inappropriate) imagery.  Regardless, I was invited here to hang out with some fellow Yelper buds during happy hour during a Thursday.  Fortunately we came just before the school year and thus didn't have to fight the ASU crowd.  Let's get to it.  Riot Hospitality Group is the brains behind El Hefe along with other valley restaurants such as Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row, Farm & Craft, and Hand Cut.  El Hefe's Tempe location lies right on Sixth Street just west of Mill on the southwest corner.  The restaurant can pack in somewhere between 100-150 people at full capacity with two fully stocked bars (one inside and one on the patio outside) and plenty of TVs at the bar, near the tables, and even above the urinals in the men's restroom (can't speak to the women's restroom for obvious reasons).  I can imagine this place jumping during the weekends when school is in session and especially on football game days.  As others have accurately pointed out, El Hefe does honor the free guac and chips check in offer (but beware only one per table).  So we got one of those to share.  The guac and salsas were fine, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Same goes for the chips.  For my main dish I was looking for something that might stand out above the usual Mexican fare that I would expect to find.  The Enchilada Blanco seemed like just such an intriguing complex dish.  Three enchiladas stuffed with pulled chicken and queso asadero.  The enchiladas are then topped with salsa roja, queso fresco, lime crema, and a white sauce I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Also came with a side of rice.  I was mostly happy with the enchiladas, though honestly I felt they could've put a little more chicken inside.  That said, I was pretty impressed with the different flavor combinations they integrated into this dish.  The rice on the other hand was super dry.  I'm guessing it was rice that cooked hours ago and sitting underneath a heat lamp.  To wash down the food, I got their house margarita which was discounted for happy hour.  I'd say the margarita was passable, but perhaps a little too sweet for my taste.  For dessert, I saw an item that had me written all over it.  I love horchata and I love milkshakes.  So naturally a Horchata Milkshake sounded magical.  I guess I didn't know what to expect it to look like so it was a little surprising when it came in a standard water glass, but the taste was unmistakably that of a milkshake blended with horchata (probably quite literally in a blender).  Tasty, smooth, and not too heavy.  Not a bad finisher.  Total cost for the entree, two drinks, tax and tip came to about $30.  As I write this, El Hefe fetches an average of 3 stars.  That's pretty much spot on based on my experience.  The food here is better than Hooters or Tilted Kilt based on my experience, though perhaps not as good as...say...Twin Peaks.  Measuring up El Hefe versus other valley Mexican restaurants doesn't really seem fair as they're not really trying that hard to be authentic to that degree.  But again, if you're in the ASU crowd and looking for a fun gathering space for a drink, this would be an attractive option.  As for the food, well, just don't expect anything in the same league as a Barrio Cafe or a Carolina's.",

Got seated at a deserted corner table in the way back which was fine bc there was a bunch of obnoxious drunks acting a fool up front anyway so yes, seat me far away from those crazies please.  The waitress came over and took our drink orders which came out fairly quickly, btw. Just as I was about to take a sip, I noticed a nice and shiny strand of HAIR sticking out of it. Oh, how lovely. Proceeded to look around for our waitress for about 20 mins or so but she was nowhere to be found. Actually had to flag down some guy who was clearing out the table next to us and told him the dilemma. He then says \"I believe you and everything but can you point it out to me bc I don't see it.\" Why of course I will. I'll also kindly floss your teeth with it, if you'd like. Like seriously? Ugh. He then goes back and finds our waitress, she asks if I want the bar to make me a new one but I declined. We dipped and went down to RA instead where service was much better, and no hair was found in my drink!   I definitely liked it better when this place used to be Canteen.",

The line is usually pretty long Thursday-Saturday and you're going to be rubbing a lot of shoulders and other body parts against people when you try and move around. Be prepared. If you don't like being close to people and you're not assertive, you're never getting anywhere in there. It's generally a very drunk, sort of trashy young crowd but what else are you on Mill for anyways? El Hefe is the classic college club crowd and it needs to be experienced by everyone at least once in their life, but it's definitely not my first choice. Also lots of people try to jump the patio fence while they're waiting in line...Don't.",

    "text": "I'm from out of town and thought this looked like a good place to sit at the bar and enjoy a game on TV and the outdoors. I was by myself. There were three bartenders, and it was after six minutes that the younger gal, DeeDee, came to attend me. Great gal and she really tried to make things right. BUT alas she's young and really doesn't have the experience to work the bar. Total people at the bar was 15, enough for three bartenders to keep us happy, but not so much when there is only one   First - all three bartenders made drinks and the drink area was dirty. They never washed their hands even when handling food or after handling dirty dishes. Only the male bartender had a bar towel. He never used it. All straws were picked up and shoved into a drink by handling the tip of the straw.   Second - the other female bartender, would just walk around and thrill her hair. Even when my drink was empty and DeeDee was busy, she just looked at it and walked by. I had made the decision to only have another one if I was asked. She continued to talk about her legal problems to two guys, who were interested in her more than making a purchase. And they drank water! They spent no money. And no neither was her attorney, trust me. I have no idea who the male bartender was tending to.  Third - the male bartender was going to pour two shots of Patron, but before pouring it put the glasses in the drinking ice to chill. When that wasn't working fast enough, he had a great thought to stick the whole bottle in the ice to chill the bottle. The bottle that had been sitting on the dirty drink area. Hey there dude, IT\"S drinking ice!!   Fourth - dishes were dirty. Poor DeeDee had to get me other plates. The gentlemen sitting next to me said the same thing. I couldn't stomach the food and ordered the chips and salsa which were $3. Really?!?!?! I know this is probably a corporate thing, but REALLY corporate?   Finally, for being a Mexican bar and bragging on their good margaritas, even the top shelf was awful. Too sweet! The people next to me suggested trying the skinny since it was pure alcohol, but by then I was ready to move on to have a night cap elsewhere.   Hopefully they get their problems fixed, but I'm sure the atmosphere keeps people coming.",

I almost feel bad for the girls who are forced to degrade themselves in booty shorts and low-cut halter tops, but then again, half the chicks on Mill dress that way anyway. I guess being leered at all day by half-drunk frat boys really grinds on you, so maybe that explains the extraordinarily bad service.  Our hostess forgot to tell the waitress we were seated, so that took forever to even get drinks. Then, she forgot to bring our appetizers. All that would've been fine -- some people just have bad days -- but the food was somehow beneath actual street tacos and more bland than Chili's.   Couple all this with the obnoxious top 40 blaring from the speakers and every TV tuned to some idiotic sports spectacle and you'll understand why I hope this place burns to the ground. Leave this shit in Scottsdale, where it belongs.",

She messed up my food and then finally got it right by the time the other people in my party were done eating. She then said the manager would take care of my tab. I guess it was the manager, he tried making up for it by giving my table free shots. Hello I am 27, my days of getting free shots are over. Nor do I want a $4 shot of well tequila.

Fun, high energy, usually pretty good music. Cheap drinks. My only gripe is the amount of people they let in at once. It's an ordeal to attempt to walk across the bar when it's busy to use the bathroom. Just a fair warning, you will be elbowed, spilled on, and occasionally shoved.

We sat at the bar and waited to get service. The bartender was more interested in texting on her freakin phone instead of helping us. She saw when we sat down and continued texting, then she started chatting  to her other co-workers, then went to the other side of the bar to help other customers. She finally came over after I stared her down and had a personality of a rock!!! I'm very disappointed in the service we received and will not be returning back.

The bar is lame because they aren't even trying to highlight our amazing local breweries here in phoenix... The wait staff however is nice so that part is good.

Truth is, the bartenders stare at themselves all day and night while they fix their hair, and unless you're a friend of someone there, service is a \"c\" grade at best. Food is bland, drinks are inconsistent and the bartenders I've had, don't know how to make an old fashioned.

The food is great here it just sucks how shitty these servers are. It's like they don't understand that good service could possibly mean a good tip. Maybe you guys need to staff up and assign a table per server in order to satisfy customer needs. Sorry not sorry.",

If you were to spend money and get a table, don't bother because people are literally dancing on the reserved tables and what little spaces there are behind the tables themselves. We used our table more as a table top to place our drinks and make our mix drinks more than anything which btw no one would want to pay extra just for a table to place your drinks.   TL;DR: Don't buy a table, it's an absolute rip off",

My table of 6 could barely carry a conversation without yelling across the table over the speakers.  The chips and salsa were mediocre but they did continue replenishing the chips until the salsa was gone thankfully. The tacos were amazing on the other hand. Definitely worth four stars on their own. I tried the Duck Carnitas, the Al Pastor, their Carne Asada and the Beef Cheek taco. I'd recommend each of them and twice on days ending in a Y.   The drinks were a little weak for the prices. I had the Bulldog-Garita with the mini bottle of Sol tipped upside down in the chalice....not very strong for a 32oz. marg....the Mexican Mule wasn't my favorite either. At $10 each just order beer or tequila or both.  All that aside service was tip top and the servers here are all attractive with ASU down the block. Worth a stop in for some great tacos outside the norm.",

It was a Sunday in December, so he was looking forward to watching the NY Jets game. So, I decided to take him here! I've never been here myself, so I thought why not? It's one of the newest places on Mill Ave since I left. It's definitely a good place to watch a game.   He had a couple beers and tacos. I had some margaritas and chips & salsa. First off, they have a long list of bomb margaritas! I can't remember the funky name of the one I got, but it was the one with Patron. It would have been great if the bartender was a little bit more generous with the Patron because I barely tasted any alcoholic content in this drink. I really do wish the bartenders and servers were more attentive though. The chips and salsa were great! The guacamole was mediocre. I had to ask for more chips 3x from 3 different people until I finally got my chip refill! Also, not once did the bartender ask if we wanted more to drink even when our glasses were empty.   The vibe around this place though was pretty awesome! The owner must be from Chicago or is a Chicago Bears fan because everyone seemed to be ecstatic and supportive of the team. They even had a DJ playing while all the games were on TV, and he was pretty damn good! Bravo to the DJ",

When we finally did we had a server named Bryce. She was a nice but not very good at the service. My daughter asked for one drink and they were out, she asked for another and they were out of that also. She said that since they were out would she give her half off the next one she picked. We ordered and the food was okay. The sign at the door said Happy Hour on Friday was from 4 to 10 and said the tacos were $2.00 She told us it was only to seven but she would ask. We get the bill and we were charged full price for the tacos and she charged us for both drinks one she never had. I told her after I tracked her down and she said My Bad. I gave her money and thought she was coming back with change and she never came back so I ended up giving her more tip than I wanted to. We did love the service from Carlos who brought us more water and made sure we where okay. Not what I expected but the DJ was great. I was very disappointed.  I never saw the manager so I could not even complain. We were there for over 2 hours. It was good to try but hoped for better.",

    "text": "There isn't an option for less than one star so in order to leave a review at all, I guess I have to give them one.  First off, I called all around Tempe and Chandler looking for a place that would take a reservation for the boxing match. El Hefe gladly took the reservation over the phone - the customer service had me really smiling at that point! We were told that the reserved tables are usually expected to spend about $200 between food and drinks, sounded pretty reasonable for two couples who love boxing, food and beer so we took it. Our waitress was super good to us and the food runners were on top of things.  One huge problem that started to trash the night was when one of the security staff demanded to remove us from our reserved table and argued with my boyfriend about it - all the while our cups and plates had been cleared! We had been there at the same table for two hours, simply got up to use the restroom and came back to that.  The place was packed naturally, so we had to pretty much \"defend\" our space from others who didn't have a table.  Minutes after the fight ended I got my tab back - $356!!!! $150 over what I was quoted multiple times over the phone. While trying to add up the difference and figure out what a \"table surcharge\" is, our table was being cleared and broken down right in front of us. I tried to at least get my cup of water back from the guy and he was a total snot and kept it anyway. It was a huge rush to get us out of there, like we were in a cattle barn.  After finding a spot to speak with the guy who took my reservation, without having to scream over the music, he finally came back with a tab for $225. Fine, it's the amount we agreed upon anyways. I check my bank statement today and find out I got charged the $356 anyway!!!! I never signed for the larger tab, only the small one, still tipped our waitress and thanked the manager for lowering the bill - seriously??? How can I still get charged whatever they felt like?? Needless to say we won't be giving them any more business; they have enough for a few families on my tab alone. I wonder how many times that's happened??",

    "text": "Tonight I had the pleasure of interacting with one of El Hefe's \"special\" bartenders. He happily took my credit card for my $12 drink. Soon afterwards I was approached by the same bartender with a different card. The bartender insisted that I had gave him a Bank of America card. I've literally never been in a Bank of America in my life. I told the bartender that it was not my card. He looked at me and told me it was my card.  We went back and forth. I told the bartender, who must of been held back in elementary school reading comprehension, that no, I had not given him a red BoA card. Instead I originally gave him a dark grey Wells Fargo credit card. He looked at me and said no, he received two cards in the past few minutes and of the two this Bank of America card was mine. I told him no, I gave him a Wells Fargo card and he would look at me an accuse me of lying to him. He was so confident in himself that he wouldn't even listen to me. What a joke, I could find a better employee at the homeless shelter.  It became such a situation that everyone around me at the bar was literally pulling in my favor. The bartender would say, \"no this is your card\". And I, along with half the bar would laugh in his face and deny the absurd claim. Finally this bartender realized his mistake. I don't know if it was divine intervention or an actual self reflection but either way I received my credit card back which was a huge relief.  However the story doesn't end there.  I checked my Wells Fargo account soon after this incident. I saw the $12 drink charge, which was expected. However I also saw a $16 charge right next to it! Wow, this incompetent bartender managed to lose my card, find it, then charge it for some fraudulent amount.   I called Wells Fargo already and they have started their investigation into the matter. I am leaving you this review to consider your decisions before you visit El Hefe Tempe. The next time I visit this bar I will be sure to bring cash and I recommend you do the same.  Edit: I called El Hefe this morning and spoke with Jamie, one of the managers. He looked into it and confirmed that the bartender had charged me for two drinks. He was very understanding and is going to have the GM reverse the charge later today. Because Jamie was very cool about it I am raising my review to 2 stars.",

Earlier on in the day, they stopped by our hotel with some 'Buy One, Get One Entree.' cards. We also had a  'Drink Ticket' and 'Taco Ticket' that we previously received from EL Hefe. We walked in, saw three empty seats at the bar and took them. We sat there for probably five minutes without any type of greeting. It was until the bartender walked over and told us \"I have a guy sitting here.\" We had no issue with that. We moved over to a table close to the bar. Within seconds, a couple of guys who had just walked in, sat where we previously sat. She immediately walked over, greeted them, asked them if they were eating and handed them menus. It was just a slap in the face.   No biggie though. We placed our Drink and Taco tickets on the table and Samantha, our server, walked over gave us menus. She clearly saw the tickets laid out on the table. We all placed our drink order, three Dos Equis. It was until she came back and said \"Oh, those drink tickets don't work on these.\" Umm...okay. You failed to mention that before we ordered our drinks because? At this point, we gave up and asked for our check. We no longer wanted to order any food or deal with the customer service this location had to offer. It was nothing but attitude since the moment we walked in. I definitely won't return.",

It's not necessarily their fault that the place gets so busy, but even elevating the bar a bit and adding some separation from the dance floor could be beneficial. It took me like 10 minutes to get to the bar from the center of the room, like another 10 just to flag down a bartender, and then I had to wait another 10 just for my drink to come. It's not unheard of, but if I can go anywhere else on Mill, walk up to the bar and order my drink in like 5 minutes, then 30 seems counter-intuitive to having a good time there.",

I can see if it was a party of 8. I got robbed and the drinks were as cheap as the decor. Plus service was not attentive to my table, had to flag down service. Will never go to this place again AND I recommend going somewhere else if you're trying to get your happy on for happy hour. SMH get it together! I should have went to RA.",

    "text": "Ok I'm not one to bitch or complain but el hefe was awful. I'm a bartender myself and I'm usually pretty understanding and like to give people the benefit of the doubt but I've never received such awful service in my life. My gf and I sat at the bar, ALL of the bartenders were very inattentive. The best service I received was from the expos. My tacos came out wrong, they reordered them and the new ones came out quickly but the meat was burnt and I had to send them back once more. The bartenders weren't paying any attention so it took three times longer than it should have. I ordered a margarita with no sweet and sour, the bartender gave me a super confused look. I told him specifically tequila, lime juice, agave and soda and he still gave me a confused look with some attitude. Once I received the margarita i tasted it and it wasn't the best but I was so over complaining that I sucked it down anyways. There was a female bartender working also and disregarded my gf and I but was paying attention to all of the male patrons. I don't ask for a lot, I just want good service. If the service was good I probably wouldn't have even complained about the tacos. They would have received at least three stars if the service would have been decent but unfortunately it was the worst service I've ever received and that says a lot since I come from the same industry and I'm usually very understanding. Monty in particular was the one giving us the worst service. He didn't bother to check on us once. It took over ten minutes to close out my tab and the only reason it didn't take longer was because one of the new female bartenders who had just clocked on was nice enough to ask how I was doing and she closed out my tab. The service was awful the food was ehh and I won't be coming back the next time I visit Tempe.",

    "text": "I have no idea why anybody would come here more than once. My first clue should have been the fact that they spell the name \"Hefe\" instead of \"Jefe\". The first problem we noticed is that the music is too loud. I have no problem with loud music in an appropriate setting, but this was at 7pm. We were there for dinner. Here's a clue to the El Hefe management: if the music is so loud that your customers can't hear their server, and the server can't hear the customers, then the music is too loud. The second problem is that the servers are idiots. They clearly hire servers based on appearance and on who is willing to follow the ridiculous dress code, not on serving ability, or ability to clearly communicate with the customers. The third problem was the food. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great, either. Don't be deceived by the pictures on their website--the tacos are TINY. I guess they're supposed to be \"street tacos\", but the menu doesn't say that. They certainly are not worth $3 each. I don't care if you have unusual ingredients like beef cheeks or \"duck carnitas\", a taco that small is still not worth $3. Also, the food was cold (not ice cold, but not warm, either), which is ironic because our \"server\" made a point of telling us that the different parts of our order would be brought out as they were ready, instead of all at once. They also had a great deal of trouble getting the correct food to the table, and to the correct people. The person that brought our food (not the same person that took our order) had no problem swapping plates among people at our table, and even swapping food among plates to get the pieces in the right place. This was after people had already touched their food. Then it turned out that all the right pieces weren't even on our plates, so we had to wait for them to bring the rest from the kitchen (which we later had to remind them to bring). The fourth problem (or maybe fifth or sixth at this point) was the watered-down, flavorless \"20oz margarita\". It must have been 19oz of ice and 1oz of everything else. The final problem was that it took at least 20 minutes for us to pay our bill and get out of the place (and believe me, we didn't want to spend another minute there). Seriously people, this is the part where we GIVE YOU MONEY and you can't be bothered to bring our bill, and when you finally do, you then can't be bothered to come back and take payment. Oh, I forgot the part where the entire place smells like cigarette smoke, because apparently the smoke from people smoking outside flows through the entire place. If you want to go to a place that's too loud to have a conversation and you like to pay for overpriced watered-down drinks just so you can be seen at another trendy dump, then this is the place for you! If, on the other hand, you'd just like to have a nice dinner before going to a movie, do yourself a huge favor and go somewhere else.",

I use to go in there but its pack with mostly with horny dudes and its hard to even get a drink in a 10 min time frame. plus if your not white or a chick they won't let you in because they will find an excuse to not let you in after waiting in line for like 30 mins! I don't recommend this bar unless your white and your jeans are girl jeans tight because the bouncers are horrible and are racists just because the color of the skin. I notice they let white people in with shorts, tanks, basketball shoes, jerseys, and baggy pants but minorities are more restrict because they don't like them in there Establishment.",

The negative experience started with the hostess; the sign said \"seat yourself\" but when one of my friends asked if there was a table for 4, the hostess changed the sign to \"wait to be seated\" and just left us there. When she came back I asked if there were seats outside since it was a gorgeous afternoon. She seemed annoyed at my question and left us waiting again. While we waited my friend asked for some shots at the bar, but when the hostess approached saying there was a table, very rudely asked if we had closed the tab or we would have to keep waiting for our table. So we paid and followed her. Her lack of customer service skills was appalling. Our waitress came by and took our orders, not the best customer service either; when my partner asked for 2 beers she immediately said she couldn't serve him 2 beers so we had to clarify one was for me; Why would she assume that, if I was right beside him discussing what to order? He then asked for some jalapenos on the side for his tacos, but the jalapenos never came. For the finishing touch of our experience, they had the audacity to automatically add the gratuity...like I said, there was only 4 of us, I have NEVER been in a restaurant where the gratuity is automatically added unless it's a large party. Maybe this place adds the tip like that because they know patrons wouldn't give a penny for their lack of customer service?",

They basically held a line didn't allow anybody else to get in for happy hour even when there is open seating on the patio, not cool. When we finally did order food they messed up and placed an order for a taco not a torta, not sure how you confuse the two. And I ordered the spicy margarita which I've ordered it in the past in Scottsdale it was delicious and spicy the one I ordered in Tempe was bland no flavor and not even a hint of heat. I have been warned that the bartenders were not up to par but I  usually make my own judgement and this validated that.

    "text": "First off, if I could give this place ZERO stars I would.  Let me break it down as to why.  First, I used to love this place... quick bike ride from home, allows dogs, has the grass in the back... TVs on the patio etc.  BUT, one of the times I recently went, I had a few margaritas, tacos and a couple beers and since I sat on the patio, I had to open a tab; the tab was closed at $55.  BUT before I could close my tab, they LOST my damn credit card, took them 20 minutes to find it.  Lone behold, a couple weeks later, I check my account, and I had TWO transactions, one for the $55 that I authorized and another for $225.25 that I had nothing to do with (keep in mind this was a random weekday).  First off, if I were to spend $280 at a bar, it wouldn't be at a bar on mill... that is for damn sure and it would be on a damn weekday.  When I called to speak with a manager (Brittany), she said she would investigate and then refund my money.  However, as a couple days passed, I didn't hear from her and had to call back, TWICE.  Once I finally got a hold of her, she said she spoke with the GM, ROB, and Rob said that they were unable to refund my money and I would have to dispute it.  I saw the original receipts, the signatures don't match and the bills are from separate tables. So either one of the servers diliberately committed fraud and charged my card for someone else's tab or it was an accident.  Either way, I should have to jump through hoops to get my money back.  I used to go to this place a couple times a week, not anymore!  F El Hefe... F Riot... Boycotting all RIOT owned properties from now on.  You would have easily made way more money than $225 off of me for the next few years, especially how much I go.  But now, not only will you lose all business from me and my friends, but I hope others do as well.  Do not go to this place, they don't care about their customers nor providing a great service, they only care about $$$... to the point here they have to steal it from their customers.",

Once for wearing brand new(literally)basketball sneakers and last night for wearing camouflage cargo shorts which were also fairly new. I searched near and far on the Internet for a dress code for this establishment and all I could find was casual followed by a no dress restrictions block. It's pretty embarrassing being turned away for something I hadn't known of. I have to slam this place, being in the heart of a college campus, who would have thought this place was upscale while visibly witnessing a bunch of drunk people at the bar area from outside? I don't use this as a tool of reasoning or for any other benefit, but I am currently an active duty service member in the armed forces. I saw there is a military appreciation benefit at your Chicago location. I advise making your \"at the door\" dress code known before hosting this event, as many others in the service dress just as I do.  I'm from around Chicago area and will be sure to let my fellow service members know what to expect at the door if they choose not to wear khakis and dress shoes at the door.",

The tacos were very good and my wife fully agreed.  She liked her rice and I thought the fries were very good.  We left and I told her I would come back to eat here again for sure.  Then about 30 minutes later, we were both so exhausted we thought we were either drugged or they are using MSG in the food.  We are both sensitive to MSG and only feel like this after eating Chinese food lased with it.  I did not call the restaurant to verify weather or not they use MSG but can think of no other reason we both felt the exact same symptoms. I would highly recommend the tacos but for anyone who does not want MSG in their food, at least ask before ordering.  Just to be clear, I DID NOT verify if they do or do not use MSG.",

Appetizer: chips and guacamole  It's free with the Yelp check-in! Big enough to share with 2-3 people, but also delicious enough to eat all by yourself.  Taco: Fried Avocado  I got my carnivore-loving friend to order this taco and loved it. Ask for a side of the mango passion fruit salsa and grilled pineapple salsa. Both are very different flavors but add a great taste to the taco.   I wish their menus/advertising was updated. Their menu states frozen and on the rocks margarita, but they only offer on the rocks. They advertised $6 margarita of the month, but they don't offer those anymore either.",

The lighting is good, sometimes they have dancers on the bar, and the music is really high energy. HOWEVER, do not come here unless you are a bit drunk or you'll be fist pumping to techno all night sober-YUCK. I once made the mistake of making this place my first of the night, and I ended up just leaving because it was boring. I was also getting shoved and pushed from all angles due to drunk college students (mainly guys, this was a complete sausage fest) who smelled like armpits and desperation.",

I was dressed in a collared shirt, nice jeans, but the Jordans are what somehow disqualified me from this establishment. It was strange because others inside were allowed to wear, seemingly whatever they wanted, including flip-flops, boat shoes, crocks, and suspiciously sneaker looking kicks. There were no warnings that these types of shoes weren't allowed, until you go through the entire line and are embarrassingly declined entrance.  While the security guard was friendly enough, this denial had undertones of racism to me. The bar was bumping the latest rap songs, hip-hop tunes and beats, but disallow anyone who wore shoes from that culture inside? What kind of message does this send?  Who are the most likely to be affected by a rule that only disallows brands like Nike, Adidas and Jordans? You can make up your own mind about this 'rule', but El Hefe is one place me, mine, and everyone I can reach will not be supporting! Take your money else where.",

Got guac and chips for an app, came with a good amount of chips and guac was fresh and tasty. Would order again.   Ordered the $5/6 margaritas, pretty regular. Not bad, not amazing, but good nonetheless.   Lastly got the $2 tacos. Got mahi-mahi, carne asada, and chicken tinga. All veryyyy flavorful; I was surprised yet very happy. The tacos are decently sized with complimenting toppings/sauces. Definitely going again especially on taco Tuesday's.   The atmosphere is loud and almost club like, so probably not somewhere for a first date or someplace you go to talk about your life problems or story time. But great to go with friends or even solo to listen to a variety of music, possibly dance and grab some food and drinks after a long day.",

I'm not sure why there's such harsh reviews of this place, I thought the food was great. To start we had some complementary chips and salsa along with a free chips and guacamole for checking in on Yelp. The guacamole was great, super tasty. The only complaint here would be the chip to dip ratio. For an entree I had the three tacos with black beans. I opted for the mahi mahi, pork al pastor & carne asada. I loved the mahi mahi & carne asada, but wasn't too keen on the al pastor. It was just too sweet for my liking.  Overall I thought this place was pretty good. Tasty fun, high energy, good music and a great location. I'm not sure what's not to like? I'd definitely come back here again and try some more of the tacos.",

It started off fine, but at 10 it changes to the night club which is to be expected given it it downtown mill. However, what was not expected was the female dress code. At 10:30 pm, when we left, the women had changed into skimpy bras with booty shorts that were more close to thongs.   They have a great atmosphere but like I said awkward for parents. The staff was friendly and it was an upscale place with two outside props which were very nice as well. The music was great and excellent for dancing which I love!!!   At 10 they have a 2 for 1 deal on shots. We had 4 fairly large shots and I felt nothing. I haven't drank in a few months so I should have felt them more than I did.

    "text": "I came here on a Friday night around midnight and there wasn't a cover. This place was PACKED. Felt like I was in a sardine can. If you want to dance, good luck, because the dance floor was crowded the entire night. My friends and I tried dancing, but there simply wasn't enough space so we couldn't enjoy it and went to the patio. The patio was great though, lots of space, seating, and even games. There's this bean bag tossing game at the end of the patio - some guys wanted to play so we split into teams and it was a lot of fun!   I like that there's also girls on the bar that give free shots if you come up and open your mouth. Crazy stuff. Then there's seating inside if you don't want to go to the patio. This place is like a gigantic bar with a tight dance floor, that's the best way to explain it.   The bathroom situation is very unique. So you wait 5-10 minutes in a boys & girls line  and a security guard allows one guy or girl to come in when a guy or girl comes out accordingly, just like the teacher would in elementary school - wait your turn boys and girls! Then, once you're in you have to wait in a normal line at the bathroom stalls. The bathrooms are gross, not polished or clean, just dingy and unkept. There's a giant mirror there though to fix your makeup or check yourself. Then the sinks are outside with soap which is a walkway so that's impractical. And finally, when you're done you're out of that chaos and into the dance floor chaos - one tornado after the other.   Yeah, too crowded for my taste. Also the DJ wasn't very good unless you like oldies and 80's dance and hip hop. It's a nice place to hang out with friends on the patio, but inside the establishment is crazy and definitely not for me.",

We sat at the bar and it took the bartenders a few minutes before they gave us menus & offered drinks. Once we ordered our drinks, it took about a good 10 minutes until our drinks got to us. The food was pretty good. They could run our food together since there was only two of us, but they ran them separately. The house margarita wasn't all that. I ordered another one and it took another 10 minutes to receive my drink. She made it before she forgot to give it to me so it sat there roughly 5 minutes before she remembered. It could be better. FOH staff needs to tune it up.",

We found a couple stools at the bar and ordered chips and salsa and our first round. The bartender was very nice and quick to get us taken care of. The chips came out and for a \"mexican\" themed bar, pretty sad that the salsas were so bland. We got a menu and were gonna get some chow, but after seeing how much the tacos were we decided to wait and go somewhere else. We had a few more rounds, while this was happening the male friendly bartender left and 2 girls replaced him. The service quality quickly declined. They had attitudes, were slow. We left after I asked her for 2 shots of Jack Daniels Tennessee honey whiskey, and she held a bottle up and said \"this one\", I answered her stating \"no, the one right next to it\"... After that she got a bigger attitude and huffed at me. Yeah we called it a day.",

First of all, I shouldn't have to get up more than once to have a request fulfilled. We came with a party of 4, ordered a few margaritas, 2 appetizers and 2 tacos. We literally waited 45 minutes to get our stuff and only AFTER we told the waitress and manager a handful of times. We never even got our tacos, we were just fed up and left. Next time you want something done right at this place, don't waste your time. Go to the Scottsdale location, this ones a joke.",

We waited patiently for someone, it was saturday night and the place was packed, and one of the girls actually stopped serving drinks and spent the next 5 minutes dancing with the other bartender, leaving no drinks coming out while about 10 of us waited. Couldn't get a jack and coke right, first one was all coke, 2nd was all jack, gave up on a third attempt and just had a beer. I will say the place was loud amd rockin', and that's why we went there. Excellent atmosphere, and a big crowd if thats what you're into, but we came to drink and that was a disappointment.",

    "text": "I wanna start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of El Hefe in Scottsdale. You get what you pay for there, and I'm totally ok with that! In fact, I reserved a table for my graduation at the Scottsdale location, instead of the Tempe location which is where my university is located. Why? Glad you asked!  I've been to El Hefe Tempe more than I'd like to admit. It really is a fun place, don't get me wrong. I think you have to mentally and physically prepare for how crowded it is on Thursday-Saturday nights. If you're not a few (or several) shots in, don't bother going. This place is a nightmare with trying to get drinks. The bartenders at the main bar try their best to get to everyone but there's always way too many people. I am always prepared to wait 15-20 minutes for a drink (on a good night). The back bar by Public House is a little faster, I recognized a bartender there from her working at previous bars in the area. She's fast, makes drinks really well, and in my opinion, is mainly why that back bar was doing so well (move her to the main bar! blonde girl with shoulder length hair).  The bar by the front patio is the one I have the most problems with. There's only one bartender there, always a guy. Every time I go there I have to wait way longer that any of the other bars to get a drink. Throw another bartender in there! That one male bartender always has a huge attitude and serves other people who wait less than I do. This happened to me twice last week on two different days.   In addition to bar service, this place is CRAZY packed. You really have to be careful and not step on anyone's toes here, this place is that crowded. Good luck trying to dance, there's simply no room! Another big issue I have is the bathroom. There's no enforcement to the line and girls cut like crazy. Even if the \"bathroom bouncer\" sees it happen he doesn't do anything about it. I kid you not I've waited at least 20 minutes to get into the bathroom. Ladies if you have to pee go before you come here! Somewhere else might be a little cleaner too. I haven't ordered food from this location yet but I have at the Scottsdale location, I'll update this review once I've ordered tacos from Tempe Hefe.   I think these are the main reasons I didn't want to celebrate my graduation at Tempe Hefe. My experience there is always so-so and never gets to the level of fun I have at the Scottsdale location. I don't think El Hefe Tempe is completely awful, it just needs a little more improvement.",

This past Sunday evening, my husband and I came in here as our first stop on Mill for the night. The first thing we noticed was that the place smelled AMAZING. Whatever air freshener they have is incredible! We sat at the bar and were greeted by a very attractive bartender who was quick with our drink orders and answered all of our questions. We had a few draft beers and their tequila bombers, which were super tasty and at a good price. The decor and atmosphere of the bar is great. I loved the pink accent lighting and the pattern on the booths. There was one group that had definitely imbibed a lot of liquor that day and were getting a little rowdy and dancing on top of the booths, but it's Mill, and I wasn't really surprised.  Overall, we had a blast, and we will definitely stop here every time we go to Mill Avenue!",

There were 7 of us that came up to the bar to order drinks, after standing there for like 10 mins, she finally graced us with her attention. Mind you there were only like 15 people in the bar..... We asked her to make us all the house margarita, not hard at all, it's a house mix, after rolling her eyes about 10 times, she finally decided it was worth her time to make them. We got our checks back, we all tipped her 20-25 percent, which was generous considering her horrible service. We all got back to our table and we heard her yell out across the bar, \"they didn't even tip me!\"  Who yells that across a bar??? Sorry little girl, terrible service gets a 20% tip. You didn't earn anything better than that. Horrible service doesn't earn you anything else.",

Uhhh, its not so strict if guys in there look like they are at the beach and about a centimeter close from having a male camel toe!!!!!!!!! So we kinda laughed when he said we couldn't go in thinking he was being sarcastic, but his rude and dry attitude  quickly had as laughing at him because he made himself look like a complete jack ass and permanently gave the establishment a bad name. Find bouncers that are more personable and with real judgment of what an actual dress code is.",

    "text": "I was excited to have El Hefe open on Mill since it's closer to my house than the Scottsdale location and I love their margaritas.  I was extremely disappointed with the service, I didn't expect it to be fantastic but thought it would at least be decent.   I gave this place 2 tries, my first visit was the 2nd week it was open.  My boyfriend and I sat at the bar near the front patio, we tried to order a few of the margaritas and the bartender told us she didn't have the ingredients to make those.  We asked what she could make us, she said 'pretty much just a regular margarita.'  The main bar is about 10 steps away, I was thinking she would at least either get ingredients from them to make the drinks, or have them make it and she would bring it over.  After going with the regular margaritas the bartender had the ingredients for, we finished and wanted to ordered a bottled beer.  The bartender explained she didn't have the beer we wanted at this bar.  I guess she didn't want to go get the bottles from the other bar or stock her bar properly so she could be prepared for customers.  We ended up closing the tab and leaving.    The scottsdale location has a side bar as well kinda in the back, and that bar always seems to be stocked to make all the margaritas and more from the menu.  That being said, I was kinda shocked with the laziness of this bartender, especially since we were 2 of the 4 people at the bar.    My 2nd visit was Valentines day 2014.  My boyfriend and I went to get a drink at El Hefe before dinner since the basketball game was on.  We went to the main bar this time and waited in plane view for about 10-15 minutes to be asked for our order.  As I was standing there, I noticed the bartenders were not taking anyones order from the bar, they were mainly paying attention to the tickets coming in from the restaurant.  I found this weird, especially since people at the bar were trying to order drinks but couldn't get the attention from the bartenders.  I got to order drinks and after they were made they were very good.  We finished the first drinks and my bf ordered another of the same drink, this time his drink tasted NOTHING like the previous one, it was kind of gross like it was missing a main ingredient.  After he paid for that drink, a few minutes later he noticed he didn't get his card back so he told the bartender.  The bartender asked for his last name as if he was going to look for the card and instead proceeded to go to the next customer and take a drink order ...I waited after he made the new customer their drink, to see if he would look for the card, he didn't he just proceeded to make more drinks.  We flagged down another bartender who made the awful drink to look behind the bar for the card, she did a real swift look and didn't come back to tell us if she found or didn't find the card. INSTEAD, she proceeded to take her purse and leave the bar,i guess to go on her break. WOW! We had planned to go to dinner afterwards and my bf was going to buy.  Turns out he couldn't buy or go to dinner if he didn't have his card.  So I went to the hostess this time, she took down all my information and i asked her to go look behind the bar.  I told her I know its there and we need to go to dinner but can't without my boyfriends card.  She seemed sincere and i watched her go up to the first bartender we tried to get help from.  They exchanged some words and he just continued making drinks for the tickets from the restaurant instead of even attempting to look for my bf's card.     We ended up leaving and going home since we were getting no where with the El Hefe staff and didn't have card to pay for dinner.  (If I was aware this was going to happen I would have brought money so we could go to dinner, but I didn't plan for El Hefe's staff to be completely rude and incompetent of helping a customer).  The next morning my boyfriend calls El Hefe when they opened and asked if they had his card.  What do you know...they had his card and it was BEHIND THE BAR THE WHOLE TIME! Thank you to the El Hefe staff for not even bothering to look for my boyfriends card on Valentine's day.  Thank you for ruining Valentine's Day night that was supposed to be fun and simple.  Instead it was shocking and put us in a bad mood because the El hefe staff refused to help with such a SIMPLE task.   I don't think there will be a 3rd visit.",

However, as the space is practically EXACTLY the same (aside from the unnecessarily outstretched front patio), I thought I would be nice and check it out...I can tell you now, it was a waste of time. We arrived early -before 10- on a Friday night and already, was off to a terrible start. The bouncer gave my friend the most condescending up-and-down and said, very rudely \"JUST SO YOU KNOW for next time, we don't allow Jordans in here\". Keep in mind, my friend, who is white, was dressed casually in nice, dark jeans, a button down shirt and Jordans. No basketball gear is allowed. Yet once we got inside, every tv had a basketball game on. How ironic. Already offended, we went to get drinks. We literally had a bartender look us in the eye, smile and then leave from behind the bar. You would think she'd WANT to take our money. I guess not. It would have been faster to send a carrier pigeon to Germany to get our drinks. Other irritating things that happened: -we were told the back patio was closed and came inside as we were asked, only to find 10 minutes later another group was out there and wasn't bothered at all -a manager rudely swept me to the side with his arm as he led a group of toolbags to their table. no one else was around. a nice \"excuse me\" would have worked just fine. For a fairly new bar on Mill, all in all it was an extremely disappointing experience. If you want to hang out with an excessive amount of douche bags, wait forever for overpriced drinks, be belittled by the staff, pretend to dance to outdated remixes and have an all around miserable night, then El Hefe is definitely the place to be.

Then the fun began. Hostess came over to tell us to get back in line.  Said we jump past people and took the table. We explained the reservation and she said oh okay, I didn't know. She then took our order of drinks and appetizers and left. 20 minutes later a waitress comes over and wants to take our order. We explain once again. Wait another 10 minutes, and nothing. Total of 30 minutes of my life I will never get back. All 3 of us got up and left. Walked over to Z Tejas where it's always good. Won't be back. Ever!",

    "text": "I really love the tacos here....which is the only reason why I ever come here. BUT, they just removed the duck taco from their menu. I have no idea why they would do this, because it was one of the best tacos I've ever had. Their margaritas are decent, especially when it is happy hour. I like coming here with my dog because he is allowed outside on their patio and they are pretty good about bringing him a bowl of water.  The other complaint I might have about this place is that their music is so ridiculously loud, I understand it is a bar, but when the place is empty in the afternoon their is no reason to still be blasting the music like it is a club.  Also having a hostess seat you is pretty hit or miss, I've stood their waiting for a good 5-10 minutes before someone ever came to seat me.  And on other occasions when I've just gone to seat myself because I got tired of waiting they seem to get annoyed.",

Can the moron owners at least think of another concept to put on that corner of Mill rather than your nasty, overpriced and unappetizing food that already exists in Old Town? Apparently, nobody can remember that Tempe is a True college town and we don't want (even if I am not in college) to pay 6 bucks for a beer or 10 bucks for our frozen margarita's. They even charge you for those same lousy chips that they serve at the other location. On my two recent visits, nothing bad happened, the bartender was in a good mood and the servers all are showing off their butts in their workout outfits. El Hefe, the place to get ripped off on Mill, enjoy, but it does have a nice dual patio setup.",

    "text": "Been here a few times now and each time has been completely different.  First time:   My friend I watched the football game - it was kinda quiet and our server was brand new. She didn't really know what beers were on offer or what kind of food was being served. I wouldn't've done any better, so I can sympathise with someone in her position. No draft beers were being sold, so we stuck with bottles and and ordered Chips and 4 tacos. I had no complaints  Second time:  4 of us were watching another football game in a booth - The first server was nice and did what was expected. Draft beers were being sold this time, and the food was as expected for the price we paid. We then moved outside and got a new server. Ordered a Bloody Mary and did not receive my Bacon and Celery, as advertised. The server said it doesn't come with these 2 food items (but their menu states it does). The propane was out and they had no reserves.. We left shortly after this  Third time:  Disaster! - Again, we went to watch a football game. It was a nice day and very busy. Again, we were told they were not serving draft beer (what bar doesn't serve draft!). I ordered that beer/ margarita thing and it just tasted of the margarita mix.. We ordered Chips at the very beginning only to see new people sitting down get theirs before us. We ordered food, but this took forever, so the server spoke to her manager who immediately came over to apologise. The food was cancelled and we were given a round of shots for our troubles.  The manager, Brittany Flippen, gave me her business card and said to contact her should we have any concerns.  The whole experience didn't really phase me too much. I understand its a new place experiencing teething issues along with new servers. They should close down until all issues are rectified or continue to push customers away with sub-par service.  I'll probably go back again, but I'll call ahead this time to make sure everything is in order",

THAT kind of explains the non-existant smile on the pretty little blonde's face the entire time.

I will never be coming back and i tell everyone to stay away when going to mill because i just dont want them to waste their money or have a bad experience, sucks though cause they play good music and have an awesome dance floor but not worth the snotty vibe",

For $12 bucks each we thought it was kind of a waste.  We did try a taco and ponied up $3 bucks for the chips and salsa.  I do have to say the tacos were delicious and although they charge for the chips and salsa, it was fairly good.  I do like the environment of the place but just disappointed in the drinks.",

Simply holding my drink while walking in the bar. And it was only 12 am too. I understand weekend are crazy security has to be ready for anything but lighten up .

I liked that I was able to switch up the type of tacos and of course, I chose three different types. Sorry, I can't honestly comment which ones were which, or how each were. Why? It took forever to get our six tacos!   The service wasn't good. We were there on a weekday during lunch. It was packed! The waitress seemed to be the only wait staff in the entire restaurant. She was literally running from table to table. We ordered the chips and salsa (free with a Yelp check-in) and guacamole. When she placed the chips and salsa down on the table, in a quick hot second I turned my head to ask about the guacamole and she was gone, I told you, literally running from table to table.   The atmosphere is a college sports bar with an Americanized Mexican twist. Most people were sipping on margaritas early on in the day and it was already pretty loud. Not a place I'd recommend for kids.",

The security guard at the front checked my id & all & waited a moment then told me I could not get in because of my sneakers.  First of all this appears to be more of a bar style venue that has indoor & outdoor areas & I don't recall seeing a dress code sign anywhere but it made for a disappointing night because everyone else really wanted to go there but they understood that I couldn't get in so we left & went elsewhere.",

If I sit at the bar, and it's not slammed, I don't think it's too much to ask for the bartender to promptly acknowledge me. If your busy, fine just day \"be right with you\"! Nothing. I felt invisible. Asked another server to speak to the manager and he came out from the back and still bartender didn't acknowledge me.   Thanks manager for trying to fix your inattentive bartender's blunder, I appreciate it, but it just wasn't meant to be. I just don't have time for mediocrity! Hopefully, this place improved with the right management, as I've seen recent reviews slamming the service.",

There aren't any bars that enforce a strict dress code. (That's what Scottsdale is for) after waiting in line for about 10 min one of our friends was denied entry because of his Jordan's. They were considered \"basketball shoes\" and apparently basketball shoes aren't allowed. WTH???! Mind you- we have been to multiple El Hefe's around the valley (West Gate and Scottsdale) and he was wearing Jordan's  those times too, and we were never told anything. From the outside, you could see other people inside the bar wearing Nikes, vans, converse, boots... in my opinion, Jordan's are way nicer than your average sneaker. Not sure if this was a race issue due to the inconsistency of enforcing their so called \"dress code\", but unfortunately they lost my service for good... we went to multiple bars after that, with no issues with dress code at all!

We almost turned around...how unprofessional  But then....when we sat down we were lucky enough to have Kennedy and Ray serving our table. Yes, lucky!! They were the ones busting ass in this joint. Kennedy asked if we had any questions about the menu, which we did and we were with a picky eater! Kennedy really helped us pick out our picky eater tacos and we ordered another 2 helpings! Spot on!   Ray was bringing food and also making sure we had what we needed. He was awesome and doing twice the work of anyone in there besides Kennedy and maybe the bartender.   These two kept our food coming which was awesome!!! We tried the carne asada, camarones and pork tacos..they had a spin on the ingredients and it was all good.   We felt spoiled because Kennedy and Ray took such great care of us..and kudos to the chefs!!

We were going to meet some friends here for birthday. As we were approaching the door I was told that I wouldn't be let in because I had on Jordan shoes. This completely threw me off because As I look inside of the club I saw a lot of different shoes like Nike, Adidas, flip flops, Chucks(basketball shoes) and a bunch more.  I feel like they are singling out the black race and culture. I've been through this before in the past and I didn't speak up, but this time I'm not going to shut my mouth. It's crazy how far we've come as a race but things like this puts us back years. This company's policies are the problem in the community and I feel that someone needs to do something about it. I promise to share my experiences with anyone and everyone I can and I PROMISE to never spend a dollar there.

The street corn is a must...Also loved the coconut shrimp tacos, and the green cilantro rice!!!  We even tried the churro dessert... And they made them and the sauces fresh on the spot!  For what it is trying to be, it hits the mark exceedingly well!!!  Oh... And the Bulldog-Garita isn't bad either, bartender even customized it for me to include champagne... Yum!",

As my friends/family waited in line,  security came up to my cousin and advised  him he wouldn't be able to go in due to his \"basketball shoes\"...I then stated to him they are Jordans. He then looked at me and asked if I knew who Michael Jordan was and said he played basketbal haha and said they were \"basket ball shoes\" therefore he wouldn't be able to let my cousin in and was saving us some time NOT to wait in line..... I didn't see any strictly enforced dress code on El Hefe website regarding Jordans. It's absolutely crazy to turn down any man just because they are wearing a great brand of shoes.  I definitely wouldn't bother referring anyone to El Hefe Tempe.",

Even if you are over 21 but have an old license you acquired before you were 21, they WILL NOT accept these all up and down Mill Street.  Our daughter is over 21 but had an old license.  We came in the front (there is also a side patio entrance) that is just a gate door, but there was no hostess so we seated ourselves in the patio.  We had to move some plates and drinks from the previous patrons to another dirty table and waited a long time but finally we had a friendly server.  We had beers, and appetizers, it was happy hour and the appetizer were $1 off.  I had the fish tacos and my husband had the beef.  He was really sick for the next two days and he thought it was from the tacos.  My son had the chicken and he was fine.  The food was nothing special.  It has a nice patio where you can watch all the people (and homeless folks) but I would plan my meals somewhere else and just go here for a drink next time.",

We had the pleasure of meeting hefes \"greatest\" manager named Austin. We were both sober patiently waiting in 100 degree weather for 20 minutes. When we get to the front Austin decides that my friends shirt is too tight around his arms. The shirt is normal length and not tight around the body and Austin deamed it to be not acceptable and decided to let 2 white men in with just as tight of shirts and laughed at us when we tried to calmly resolve the situation. Austin intearagated my friend wanting to know which bar he worked at and we refused to tell him in fear he would call our bosses. I am amazed this fellow has a job with such lack of professionalism. The situation could have been handled a lot better. hopefully riot will handle this appropriately",

I can say it was one of the best nights out on Mill. Bottle service, great music, gorgeous ASU women, what more can you ask for? After that memorable experience, I decided to come back during the day to check out what they offered for lunch and dinner. I tried the Hefe Dog, feeling a little adventurous, and it definitely hit the spot. Now not only is this a great spot to party at night, it also boasts a tasty Mexican stylized menu that is pretty impressive. It's safe to say, El Hefe is the real deal.",

As soon as we got to Mill we weren't sure where to go cuz we had never been there before and we saw El Hefe and wanted to go but we also saw the line and at first said no. After going into a couple of places we decided to bite the bullet and wait in line. They absolutely had the BEST music (out of the 3 places we went) and the best atmosphere. I was in jeans, a shirt, and combat boots as was my friend and her bf was in jeans as well.....idk what people are talking about a dress code cuz we had no problem at all. Idk if they have changed their rules since we went like last month or what but we experienced no problem getting in. We are all 3 100% Mexican, and you can tell, and got zero dirty looks or remarks. Again not sure where race or color came into play with other reviews but I only know MY experience.   The drink service at the bar was pretty quick for being so packed the only thing is we didn't like our drinks but we were experimenting with drinks so maybe they just weren't our taste. Moral of the story- we're coming back this weekend.",

I am not a conservative and very attractive female who fells free wearing mini dresses and shorts. But, I absolutely find it inappropriate to get food from someone who barely covered. Where is the hygiene? Additionally, there are many other ways to present sexuality (if this is the policy of the place), mature ways that will attract different customers. Place lacks friendly smiling  personal, good selection of beer (Miller, Budweiser and etc topped by one or two local breweries choices). If you want attract customers who value good food, drinks, and service, you need to change some things around. Until then, I will think about ElHefe as a place where people come to get drunk by drinking shitty beer or poor quality drinks at high prices and look at booties! I may be rough with the way I wrote. I very seldom give negative reviews. In this case, I was highly disappointed by the place",

I walked in here with my boyfriend and we had 4 others meeting us, the hostess' told us they were totally full with no tables available and that it would be a 25 minute wait, mind you, it wasn't even that busy. We wondered around to see if we could manage sitting at the bar, we then saw there were 2 tables outside, a 2 seater and a 6 seater table. We then went and asked if we could sit at the 6 seater and just go to the bar and get our own drinks, the hostess' agreed and then we sat down. The hostess came walking up with a group of 4 and said that we were not able to sit there because she has a table of 4 she needs to sit, I assured her we had 6 people with us and 4 were on the way. She then argued and told us to leave the table. We even talked to the \"manager\" who was sweeping outside and did absolutely nothing to accommodate us. Don't waste your time with this establishment.",

And the three servers that were in sight were just taking care of select tables. So we found the table we wanted and stood there in hopes that someone would see us and come clean it. That is not what happened. We had to clean it ourselves by moving everything to another empty table.   Now that we have sat down we waited for our server for 10 minutes. They clearly saw us but neglected to come to our table.   After managing to finally get our order in it took 40-45 minutes. Mind you it was only two of us and one of us just had a salad.

First time was at James Kennedy's event where I nicely asked the El Hefe security if I could go outside because one of the people who worked with James told me he was doing a meet and greet. He said \"I don't care and you can leave\" and started to act like he was going to push me so that I would back up... like I can be treated like that for just asking a question!! And he could have said it nicely! Then my turn comes in the meet and greet and when I asked the security if my boyfriend could come in the picture with me they said no!? Second time with security here was much worse and actually frightening; a couple weekends ago when we went here to celebrate my friend's birthday, my friend was dancing and his seeing glasses fell on the floor as a security guard was walking by and the security guard totally just YELLED, no BARKED, in his face (literally sounded like a scary dog barking in his face) asking \"why the hell would you move like that when i'm clearly trying to walk by\"...... totally uncalled for yelling and honestly doesn't even make sense what the security was getting mad at!!!! I was afraid to even tell the security guard that my friend actually bent over to get his glasses... I knew that would hurt that security guard's ego and make him feel dumb and he probably would've just gotten even more mad at us for no reason lol! Come here if you want to get yelled at, have security guards power trip, and be rude to you for no reason.",

    "text": "As soon as I saw a sugar skull on the sign, I knew I was destined for the place.  Just as you cannot judge a book by it's cover, you cannot judge a restaurant on it's signage.  Luckily for me, cool sign aside, I was loving everything I tried.  Even the presentation was impressive.  They serve the tacos on a large branded butcher block.    Do not miss the Yelp check in bonus!  Our table got free guac and elote dip.  Both were double dippablly good.  I would order both again in a heart beat.  I'm not even a guac person and was all over this dip.  The braised beef cheek taco was super tender and juicy.  The chicken tinga taco with its passion fruit salsa, jicama relish, lime crema and hint of chorizo was addictive.  For their al pastor, they braise a pork shoulder, and it's full of flavor from the pineapple salsa.  I could eat these tacos- every day.  All day.  El Hefe (The Boss) Supermacho Taqueria also has some pretty good margs.  I stuck with the happy hour house marg but the salty chihuahua with jalapeno and hermanos pistola with cucumber pique my interest.  The place was pretty rowdy and this was just during a week night dinner.  I gather at night this becomes a club.  Who would have ever thought that a club would serve some of the best tacos I ever had.   They passed around crazy mustaches and we got some hilarious selfies.   While, it was not the best place to dine with a baby, we were with a group and made it work.  However, the food was so good, I would tempt fate again and bring her in the future, if it meat I got my hands on these boss tacos!",

I was wearing a brand new pair of Jordan's. It didn't make sense because there were people in line with older Jordan's that looked rundown and other shoes like vans and converse that looked like they were dragged across the ground with scuff marks and dirt all over them. I understand there's dress code but to not call others in the same brand shoe out or allow people with busted shoes in just doesn't make sense. Maybe I'll wear pajamas and sandals next time and I'll definitely get in. If I try this location again.",

After about 35min we realized we still hadn't received our food. Unfortunately the waitress made an error and didn't place the order. We left and decided to look for something else since we were short on time. Sadly we could not find anything to eat, so we gave up and walked back to our car which happened to be right in front of El Hefe. The manager on the shift saw us get into our cars and she ran out offering to give us our food to go and free of charge! We we're starving and thankful she saw us! A big thank you to El Hefe for going above and beyond for the free lunch, that was really nice!",

Not only was the entire patio open, but we had a wait... but they messed up our entire order for three different plates.  When we let one of the guys know, not our server.. he snapped and said \"just keep that one\" what did u want... sounding and looking very rude and annoyed.. uhm, I'm sorry sir... we didn't plate it and send it out.. get an expedited back there so you don't have his problem. When we let our server know she said \"oh the kitchen has its days.. and they have been messing it up\" uhm, we don't care for your unorganized kitchen.  Bless our servers heart, she was the only one in that entire place who cracked a smile..  any who... who ever owns this place needs to check it out on Sunday nights. We didn't get plates. Utensils, nothing. When we asked that same guy who snapped for utensils.. he, again, with an attitude said \"ya. They are finishing rolling them in the back, we have been busy\" we get it.. just say... \" sorry about that, I'll bring some out in a moment\" mind you our food was already on the table after 45 min.. we asked for a box to the same guy, and he never returned with one. I can go on and on.. but for this place, I'll stop.   Thanks, but no thanks.",

    "text": "I absolutely love Mill Ave. and its atmosphere. This particular bar has changed hands a few times. Now that it's El Hefe, while it does fit the culture of Mill with its laid back patio bar feel and delicious food, the service leaves much to be desired.  My friend and I put our name in for a table but opted for a spot at the bar since we were hungry and wanted to grab a drink while we waited. In the cumulative time we spent waiting for a bartender to even acknowledge us, we could have walked to another bar and been served our drinks and food. I'm not big on \"assuming the position\" as far as it comes to bars (I had a friend once tell me, you have to lean forward and put an arm out to get their attention). Nah; I expect a bartender to do their job and notice someone new and, if not ask if they need something, acknowledge us and say \"I'll be right with you!\" or \"How you doing tonight?\" We received neither. Our bartender was nice enough to exchange my margarita when I discovered I didn't care for it (the Chihuahua isn't all it's cracked up to be; for a Mexican food place, not the best marg I've ever had), but then we waited an eternity to pay our checks.  I would definitely come back for the food, but not for the service or drinks. Nothing impressive about either one. However, knowing there are $2 taco specials, I would probably try to plan ahead next time and order everything in one go, something like this:  :After getting the bartender's attention: Bartender: You ready for some drinks? Me: Actually, we're ready for it all. Can we get two frozen margaritas, four tacos, an order of guac and chips (brought out before tacos please), and the check?  Probably will save us lots of time and trouble next time around, if there is a next time. Too many other great bars and restaurants on Mill may make it tough to give this one another chance.",

    "text": "Here's a tip about 5-Star Yelp reviews:  When they start getting extremely specific about deals, specials, and how you can sign up for text alerts, 10/10 times they are written by employees driving the average rating up and bumping negative reviews down the page.  As evidenced by this page, El Hefe has clearly encouraged their employees to leave good reviews talking about salad and taco specials to compensate for the customer reviews about their establishment.  Now, as for my experience...  In line at about Midnight, I witnessed an individual be told 'hey man, sorry but no basketball shoes in here' and was told the same thing once I reached the front of the line.  Being a logical person, I look not for coincidences but for patterns, and the pattern here was curious being that there were clearly people inside the venue wearing flip flops, Chuck Taylor sneakers, Vans, and yes, 'basketball shoes.'  So where is the pattern?  What made those individuals exempt from the 'basketball shoes' rule?  Well, myself and the gentleman who were refused were both of African descent, while the individuals inside were of European descent.  Again, this is simply a pattern that is only logical to reach.    When I asked about the 'basketball shoes' policy, each bouncer had a different response.  \"Oh, flip-flops and Converse are ok\" said one bouncer.  Another was aboslutely incredulous that I had noticed the pattern of race in the equation and said that Air Maxes were acceptable but not basketball shoes.  When I pointed out that I was wearing Air Max 1s, he was befuddled and stammered out a barely coherent response.    Every dollar spent is a vote cast, and I won't be voting for a racist establishment anymore.  I've included in the album a picture of the European individual clearly wearing 'basketball' shoes.",

Just as bad! Yikes, college bars know how to pre-mix 'em ;)  What I found entertaining is the waitress, never came back to check on us after the food came out, after we ordered drinks, or after we asked for waters. Next when we sent back our drinks she told us \"its a college bar, so you can't expect top notch drinks\" okay haha. Does your manager know you say that to customers? She took the drinks off our tab, but I didn't feel like her customer experience skills were very tasteful.",

Thank you to our server who was patient with us by asking for more chips.  I came here with a group of friends and we ordered a bunch of different tacos.  They were all pretty good but I hear the prices on Tuesdays are way cheaper but overall it was still a fun time out here at El Hefe.    The churro sundae was great, it came highly recommended.  The contrast of the warm churros and the cold ice cream played off one another really well.  I love dessert and this was one of the better items.

From the beginning the service was very slow (took about 15 minutes to get even our waters and 30 minutes before we had the chance to order our food). One of the people in our party has celiac and can not eat any gluten. Our server assured us that what she had ordered on the menu was gluten free because the tacos were on a corn tortilla. Everyone's food in the party came about the same time except for the person who had celiac. We waited about 15 minutes for the other food to arrive and it never came. We couldn't ask out waitress because despite serving other tables right next to us she never came to our table and we could never get her attention. Finally we were able to ask another restaurant employee about the food and he said he would check with the kitchen. About 15 minutes after that the food came and the tacos were on flour tortillas (even though on the menu it said corn and the server assured us that it was gluten free). The person in our party waited 30 minutes for a meal they couldn't eat. We also never spoke to our server again after she took order as she sent other wait staff to do everything else. It was very clear she did not want to interact with us. It was super uncomfortable as. she was serving tables right next to us.   Usually I would never give a one star review because it seems so harsh, but this experience was so bad that I would not recommend other people to go there.",

I literally wondered if t had any alcohol in it and I'm normally not so picky. Second my glass was dirty. Then my boyfriend wanted dos XX and they didn't have any! The tacos are pretty delicious. The chips were stale. I did a yelp review and got them for free so I couldn't complain. The atmosphere is pretty great! The only way we had fun was taking shots which made me wonder if that was the point of them being out of dos XX and the margaritas being so watery. I though I may had been the only one but others at the bar agreed with us. I felt rushed by the bartender asking if I was done and needed the check like 50x while having food in front of me. I get if you're busy but it was a Tuesday at 3pm. May give it one more shot but overall.... disappointed.   Updated review :::::::::::: Lauriel and Zack were AH-may- ZING! I went to give this place a 3rd chance and let me tell you.... they did not disappoint. They were attentive, friendly and the food came out fast. We had the opportunity to meet Carl while at the bar as well and again.... this crew of people were so far better! I will most definitely return.",

I had the enchilada something it was hot and fresh but it wasn't anything amazing! My mother has this huge burrito which was bland for the price it should've had more flavor plus it was DRY. The only interesting tasty thing that we had was the elote dip it was sweet yet savory paired well with the chips. I would only go back for appetizers & the atmosphere.",

The $6 happy hour house margarita was very weak. I ordered a second blue berry margarita and it was ok. Overall the drinks were not good and I would skip this place if I visited again. It does have a nice outdoor patio. I ordered the nachos with beef steak pieces. The cheese was the melted white nacho cheese which was too thick. My friend order the street tacos which she really enjoyed. I would not recommend the nachos but yes on the street tacos.",

The patio is very good as well. Actually, they have a lot of tables inside too. There are a lot of TVs so if you plan to watch game or fight you can relay on them.   The staff is unbelievable. Firstly, they've made non-alcohol Mojito for free since \"it's just sprite with mint\". Then they've made a couple mistake with orders and gave us a free plate of nachos with cheese dip. It was very nice from their side.  If I be in that area again and will plan to get burrito up definitely go there.",

While most bars on Mill are lively, inviting, and fun, El Hefe is boring and honestly painful to experience. The bartenders are excruciatingly slow, and the bouncers are quite rude without any reason. They're looking for any chance to be aggressive and physical. This review isn't a result of a bad encounter, but rather from collective experiences here. If you decide to come here, expect bouncers to be mean, drinks to be subpar, and the atmosphere to be disappointing. Spend your time and money elsewhere!",

Really the only downsides of this place is their bathroom location inside, and their location only attracts college students, with college student income. According to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fehow.com&s=d3c4eb5a88696727caf3e2ec49a9a8524784a34118cd336fad6e33a4ac599c39\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ehow.com</a>, the average college student working full time makes $14,400 a year.

They always have a very fun theme for each night too that I personally think keeps the crowd coming.  I have came here for the World Cup Games and it is honestly so much fun! Hefe is a bar that gives you the opportunity to just fuck around and have a good time(mustaches, zebras, beachballs and confetti poppers).   Their margritas are pretty addicting and lowkey obsessed with their chicken tacos... just sayin!   Keep up the good work Hefe!",

We sat at a booth for approximately 3 minutes before a young lady appeared who was the bartender.  She made eye contact with me as she walked to the bar.   She proceeded to just talk to people at the bar and drink her bottled water.  A young man came out from the back passed by us twice with no acknowledgement, but was extremely friendly with 2 guys at the bar.  We have been in this industry, combined, for over 30 years.  We wanted to spend $$ at your establishment and would have tipped accordingly.  Very disappointed.",

The staff is friendly, although, a little like Hooter's girls.  Service was very very slow, food was great, $2 tacos very good.  I would look around a little in the area before stopping here, but...give it a try and decide for yourself.",

    "text": "I was visting Tempe for the art festival last weekend and stopped by El Jefe for tacos and a drink. They had a lot of TVs and bartender was very nice. I noticed their very large advertisements for NFL Football and so i decided I would comeback on Sunday night to watch my Chargers play the patriots for SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.  Once I arrived Sunday Night, my friend and I ordered food and drink and noticed none of the TVs were on NBC, so around 5 minutes before game time I asked the waitress to change the channel to SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL and she said \"no problem\". 15 minutes later (10 minutes into the game) the Tv still hadn't changed and the waitress returned. She said the manager had left and they weren't allowed to operate the remote! She then said \"the TVs are staying where they are...\". Note, I had already placed food order and this was a very big game. The food was so so. My friend and I had to scarf down our meal and go across the street where the game was on every TV. I do not blame the waitress but don't have giant NFL advertisements on every other tv and not show NFL Football unless you are wiling to hire people competent enough to operate a tv controller. I mean it's a sports bar right? Decent place to hang out.... Unless you are trying to watch football. Figure it out",

I'm not certain why there are always so many people with their butts parked in the patio when I pass by on my way to class but I can only assume it's the convenience of the location. I go to bars to get my drink on. I go to Mexican restaurants expecting some decent salsa. If you're the same (either booze or Mexican food), this isn't the place. If you're a college guy or a lonely older man looking for some interesting girls, this is your joint.",

I went there today for taco Tuesday after seeing an acquaintance who works there advertise for it on Facebook. Now I know why he has to advertise for people to come to his own restaurant. We sat at a sticky table, had mediocre service, drank pre made margaritas that tasted watered down and weak, and then ate terrible food. Between the two of us, my friend and I ordered quite a few of their tacos. It just seemed like El Hefe took shortcuts everywhere. The tortillas were stale, the shrimp on the tacos tasted like it came frozen from a bag, the al pastor was not al pastor... One of my tacos literally tasted like vomit. I couldn't finish it and I'm one of the least picky eaters out there. We were still hungry after the tacos and ordered chips and salsa which were extra... Come on guys it's a Mexican restaurant/ bar. Anyways, the salsa was bland and I can't say I didn't see that one coming. I wouldn't go back. The servers seemed to have an attitude, no one smiled (I wouldn't if I had to work there either).  I tried to be friendly with our server and smile but she just seemed annoyed. There are so many other restaurants and bars to go to in Tempe that are so much more inviting! We should have gone to culinary dropout.",

I ordered the hamburger and it is the best burger I have ever had which suprised me due to it being a mexican themed bar.  When I told the waitress about the deliciousness of it, she informed me it has won awards at a culinary festival for best burger, makes sense.  The servers name was Mindy, her service was perfectly on point, she is VERY nice to look at.  The TVs are huge and perfect for watching sports.  Mindy let me know that El Hefe is very fun at night when they transition from restaurant to bar scene so I decided to check it out.  She gave me the contact info to the VIP host Thomas and when I contacted him, he was very polite and informed me of the offers and pricing for VIP service.  He sold me!  I purchased a VIP table and had Mindy as my server again.  I had one of the best times I've ever had at a bar for not that bad of a price considering the great time I had.  My suggestions: Everyone needs to go to El Hefe day and/or night, speak with Thomas for a great time, and request Mindy as your server, I guarentee you wont be dissapointed.",

Get up to the bouncer and he denies me entrance....because i have nike sandals on. I just looked at him stunned. Went over and talked to another bouncer and was explained that athletic sandals are against the dress code. (sandals are apparently okay, but apparently if it has a swoosh that's crossing the line????)  I understand having a dress code, but that is stupidly specific and with no explanation given as to why...kind of frustrating. I will add that the bouncers were polite about it. They were not mean about it in any way so thanks for that I guess.   In the end, I had no problem giving my money to another bar that doesnt have silly rules like that.

    "text": "I enjoyed lunch at El Hefe last Saturday. I ordered the SuperMacho Bowl with vegetarian charro beans and no cheese. The flavor was good and the portion was sufficient for lunch. We also had chips with salsa and guacamole. You have to pay $3 for chips and salsa, but you get unlimited refills of chips. So it was worth it. Everyone else at the table has the Tres Tacos Especial plate. I tried a bite of the Deep Fried Avocado taco, and the mahi mahi taco. Both We're tasty. I was told the Chicken Tinga taco was delicious, but the Al Pastor taco was too dry. Everyone enjoyed the black beans, but I didn't try them as they have bacon. It was not very crowded for a Saturday afternoon and there were plenty of TVs playing the football game. I'd go again.",

Terribly disappointed by their inherently racially charged and biased policy as they allowed almost every other person with athletic style shoes through and refused to allow service to my friend. We tried talking to the staff and they simply dismissed our concerns.

It's weird to write this, because I know it's sort of like saying \"I'm going back for the toast,\" but the chips and salsa were fantastic.  I mean really worth getting.  The wife had tacos which she liked a lot and I had some kind of breakfast skillet that was good not great.  The staff was really friendly and quickly took care of an issue where the wrong dish was brought out to us.  It's also a cool patio right on the main drag.  I'll probably be back for tacos and margs at some point.",

However it is the opposite they talk down to you and provide terrible service you have to go looking for them yourself if you want something. The waiter Brittany is the only thing that will keep me coming back to this place, she is the only nice and genuine person working at this location. Definitely would still recommend going to the old town location instead unless you get Brittany. Honestly would have left before even receiving our food if it wasn't for her.",

    "text": "I want to keep this short and sweet but that may be difficult.  I will start by saying I am not a yelp reviewer, I don't leave reviews because I'm not bored and I don't think anyone will go or not go somewhere based on what I say. My friends and I arrived in Tempe on 3/15 and headed to El Jefe, starving and ready to start our vacation.  We had queso fundito, carne asada fries and guacamole, all amazing.  Our server Hailey seemed a bit flustered, it was taking a while to get drinks etc, but we are pretty easy going so just kind of let it go.  Once she had a few extra minutes to come talk to us we realized that she was covering for people that didn't show up to work so we all got it, we've all been servers at some point.  But when we called Hailey she responded, as quickly as she could.  We had lots of drinks, shots food, at this point we've been there about 7-8 hours with no reason to ever leave.   When Hailey was finally cut we closed our tab.  I don't know the exact amount because one of our wonderful friends grabbed it but I have heard stories and it's pretty legendary going forward, but I believe it was around $700 (Thank you Hailey, you were amazing!) We stayed another 2-3 hours, more food, more drinks, more shots.  We closed another tab at about $200 or so and some of us left.  Our last soldier arrived, had some food, more drinks and another $100 tab paid.   Let me be clear...we LOVED El Jefe.  Every time we walked past we looked for Hailey but if she wasn't there we moved on bc there are 100 bars on Mill Street and we were on a 5 day trip. Sunday evening...we'd been out to lunch, met some friends in Phoenix and when we came back to the hotel decided we wanted some of those carne asada fries and that queso so headed to El Jefe.  I'm gonna say, we had been drinking, we were not sober.  However, we were very coherent, we are old white women, we don't go stumbling around like 21 year olds drinking ourselves stupid and it was about 6pm.  We sit at the bar, which is literally full and completely male, the testosterone was all over the floor.  My friend had a drink in her hand from our last stop which she hadn't even realized or thought about.  When our bartender came over we ordered our food, he entered it and came right back to get our drink order.  I ordered, another friend ordered, and my friend with the drink told the bartender oh I guess I have the one I brought.  He grabs the cup, says I can't serve you.  Says as a matter of fact i can't serve any of you.   I'm sorry....what?  Your bar is full, FULL of loud, drunk frat boys screaming at the TV's.  At first we just laughed thinking he was joking because it was so ridiculous but he was extremely rude.  We cancelled our food order and walked out.  This jagoff actually chased us down outside while we were deciding where to go next asking what we were going to do about our food order (our 3 minute old food order) we told him we won't do anything and how disrespectful he was treating us and to check the receipts from Thursday and what a mistake he made.  My friend pointed out the bar was full of drunk frat boys and that she was honest about bringing the drink in inadvertently and what a mistake he just made and we would never be back.  He told us that WE were disrespectful for ordering food we won't pay for.  Anyone that has ever worked in any kind of restaurant or bar with food knows that cancelling an order is literally nothing...especially when it's crowded and there is no way they even started that food. Because we were starving we just went around the corner to Jimmy Johns to get sandwiches.  And this is where it got really messed up...we are in line and this guy comes in the back door of JJ's with a bag of our food drops it on the floor next to us and rushes off. He literally stalked us to Jimmy John's??  REALLY?  Maybe he was making a statement, he failed.  We brought the bag right outside and handed it to the homeless guys out front. They loved it! Got our JJ sandwiches, went back to hotel bar and enjoyed a cocktail or 2 and turned in.  This guy is an arrogant, sexist, probably ageist as well (never underestimate old white women...ask Hailey!) d-bag who truly needs to address his mommy issues.  It's really sad because we loved this place, and the food and drinks are amazing, but unless you're a cute coed you may want to pick a table in the corner out of sight or you may be \"cut off\" to make room for someone they deem worthy. So disappointing, it really broke our hearts I'm not gonna lie.  To be disrespected like that was embarrassing, and extra upsetting after we spent like $900 already.   The star is for Hailey!! Otherwise a big fat ZERO stars",

It was good, but not the best since it tasted a bit watered down. It was also $5 for 32 oz.. However, not too long after I noticed a hair in my drink and I was definitely unhappy about it. The nearest server took it away for me and Marissa said they'd replace it with a new drink on the house. Got another beerita and it tasted a lot better/stronger than the first. Normally a 3 star rating, but another star for their music. Best playlist I've heard in a while. I'd probably go again. Hopefully, I don't get another hair in my drink....",

Their chips and salsa and nachos are pretty good too. I also enjoy their margaritas and redbull vodka slushies. But definitely go during happy hour if you want some better deals",

The food is a great modern Mexican taste and the presentations is beautiful.   This location is much larger than the Scottsdale one and has a lot of patio space. There are 3 bars, 1 inside, 1 on the back patio and 1 on the front patio. The dining room is large and by night it is filled with people dancing to who ever is dj'ing that night.   On their busy nights you can expect a line, but if you're trying to get into one of the more popular places, you should expect that.  The music is always fun and the crowd is always energetic.   The staff is very friendly and always seem like they are having fun.   Overall a great place by day or by night. Who knows you might find your future ex here.",

    "text": "Fairly tasty food, if it's hot but HORRIBLE service with mindless employees.  First, I have to say the service here is typical of what you may expect when you have college students (particularly ASU) as employees.  For the guys, the girls where short shorts with cheeks exposed if that is what you are looking for.  However, you trade that for service.  The staff's collective IQ is less than that of an average college student and it's difficult to communicate with them, loud ambient noise aside.  A busboy (Brent) just walks around expressionless, flexing his muscles and acting as though he absolutely hates being there. The other, shorter, shorter busboy was the only one there with a personality and should have been waiting tables.    The DJ just hits on the waitresses the whole time while blurting out the occasional \"Sup Bruh\" when is friends come in.  I am a fan of loud (good) music but a lot of patrons were complaining, not that the music was horrible (which it was - EDM) but that it was SO loud you couldn't communicate with anyone who worked there much less the people sitting in close proximity to you at your table.  They charge you for chips and salsa, which is ok I guess.  After all, you can't make money if college students just come in and drink beer for dinner while filling up on free chips and salsa.  However, they charge you an extra $1 for every \"Shot Glass\" of salsa you order.   And I do mean \"shot glass.\"  These things are tiny and only allow you to eat about 10 chips per order of salsa.  They were out of glass pint glasses so my first beer came in a plastic cup.  The waitress said the bartender said they were the same size, 16 ounces.  No way.  I finished it and poured my next pint (in a real glass) in to the plastic cup an there was still 2 oz. left in the glass. So....the plastic cups are 14 ounces.  However, I was not charged for the first beer since I made a stink but others should be aware of the gimmick.  Bottom-line, this place is always packed, which is why we tried it.  Just be prepared for bad service and the staff  being more interested about how they look versus the service they provide.  The food was pretty good but half of it was coldish and inconsistent.",

The menu says ingredients are fresh, but there's no way in hell. We both work in the food industry and that was just a slap in the face to claim the ingredients are fresh.

Poorly made drinks and botched food orders during the day, RACIST bouncers at night that actually told my group everyone but my black friend could get in.  Unbelievable in 2014 that employeesare enabled by the El Hefe owners and managers to openly discriminate.  This place is doing a great job of bringing sub-par, snotty service to the otherwise Mill and deserves to be gone in a few months...frankly Canteen was much better.",

The place is younger and a little more trendy than places I would normally frequent.  However, the staff were VERY helpful, friendly, and cool, and the tacos were AMAZING!   I got one pastor taco, one Mahi Mahi taco, and one carne asada taco.  All were really good, but the Mahi Mahi was one of the best things I have eaten in a long time.  For me, especially just having gone to Italy, that is really saying something!  It was so good that I had to order another one.  I am sitting here trying to talk myself out of ordering more of them so I don't stuff myself to the point of not being able to walk.    I highly recommend El Hefe!",

    "text": "This place is a work of art - and not in the good way. This is my third review of El Hefe Tempe and I think this may as well be my last. I originally posted in March 2015 a 3-star and was immediately contacted by Hefe staff to try to make things right. They did and on June 2015 I wrote an updated 4-star review. Now a year later here I am again writing another review.  To be straight here - I like El Hefe. I like their music better than most places on Mill. But, good riddens, they try so hard to be more prestigious than they really are. You are not Vegas.  I recently tried to book some bottle service for a birthday party and was surprised by both the level of attention and the prices. To start off, I filled out the webform online to have someone contact me. No response. I tried emailing them at the address they have listed. No response. I tried texting them. No response. I tried the webform again. No response. Due to my previous bad experience I had obtained the personal name and number of the GM so I decided to send them, Rob, a personal Yelp message. No response. So I finally broke down and texted him on his personal number that he gave me a year ago.  Finally, a response.  Shortly thereafter his VIP guy, Thomas, messaged me about bottle service. Here is the breakdown - $1000 for the big table inside by the DJ, $500 for the tables next to the dance floor, and $250 for the patio. Who the hell wants to sit outside on the patio for bottle service? Not me - what is the fun in that? A year ago I had got bottle service, off the dance floor, for $200. And that was on the 4th of July weekend. Why did the price go up so drastically, especially seeing as how the weekend I was requesting wasn't even a holiday like last time?  I asked if they would give me the same deal as last time and they said, no thanks.  I guess they have other patrons that are willing to fork out $500 for table, so why settle for less. Just for a comparison, I ended up going next door to Whiskey Row and got a table that included a bottle and beer, immediately off the dance floor for $250. Slight difference.  I don't blame them so much for the prices. You charge in-line for the demand. If your place is able to charge $500 and people regularly are willing to pay that, then by all counts don't sell low. What I do have a problem with is the absolute lack of response. I can see things getting mixed up through one of the communication methods but for me to be ignored twice through the webform, once through email, once through texting, once through Yelp messaging is absolutely ridiculous. To have it so the ONLY way I was able to get a response was to contact the GM on his personal number of which was given to me from a prior incident is ridiculous x3.  Being ignored as such makes me feel like they have a certain client group that brings them business and be damned if they are nice or courteous to new people. You have to have an IN, otherwise, buzz the **** off, we don't need your money. If there is anything I hate more, it is begging people to take my money.  The only reason that Hefe Tempe gets 2-stars instead of 1-star is because they have great music. I'm adding this to my Pot-o-douchebaggery Yelp list and I don't think I'll be coming back. My suggestion is that if you're looking for a good time, go next door and save yourself some money.",

My friend and I came in at about 2:30pm and it was almost empty, we were told to pick anywhere to sit and they'd be right with us. We ended up waiting 20 minutes just to get a menu and water even though there was maybe 3 other parties in the entire place. It then took an additional 40 minutes for us to each get TWO small tacos. The service was awful and they seemed to have no sense of urgency. The reason im giving 2 stars is because the tacos were very good! like seriously it was almost as if they were back there butchering a cow for my steak tacos we waited way too long.",

    "text": "Twas a tight place. We came here on a Saturday 1/14/2017 and anticipated a lot more people to show up, but it rained so maybe that's why the turnout was smaller than expected.   There were dancers I guess, but as soon as we showed up around 9 PM, they were leaving, which I thought was odd.   We ordered Long Island Iced Tea's. They were good.  Right around that time, people started to line up outside, but again, no dancers and a DJ. Weird. Maybe management didn't anticipate high turnout on a rain day? By then, we left.  Since I didn't stay the full duration til 2 AM, I'm hopeful to try them out a second time. From what I hear, El Hefe has some good tacos. Can't wait to try these, and if the pork al pastor is really, truly \"al pastor\", which I haven't seen in all of Arizona yet, then I'm all in.",

    "text": "Sometimes in life all we need is a 2nd chance to make it right!   Visited El Hefe this past weekend and had a great experience. Service was top notch, food came out quickly, and the drinks certainly were the highlights.   If you noticed my prior review, I am pleased to share the entire staff, management, and everyone we encountered was polite, friendly, and very accommodating.   Jessica served us and she was a delight! Very attentive and made our experience really sweet.   Guys-- the eye candy at El Hefe is reason enough to go... And if you're planning on bringing your lady, just keep your eyes glued on your date so you don't get in trouble drooling... Because this place may be one of the best places to watch any game, fight, or match on their huge and many TVs.   The selection of tequila & beer should meet any preferences or demands. We drank Casa Noble and had a delish margarita. Very good!!!   The food is a big step up from typical bar food, but don't expect authentic Mexican cuisine. They offer a great selection of tacos and snacks to pair your appetite for drinks. We loved the macho nachos and there's no way 2 people can eat all those chips piled high with all that yummy cheesy goodness. For a sun night out or to watch any exciting game, you will enjoy the snacks and the killer drink selection.   Coming back a second time, I made sure to seek out the management crew and shared my thoughts about my experiences. My biggest advice is seek out Rob, Erik, or Jamie if anything is either really good or really bad-- these guys truly care about the customer experience, and are striving to make El Hefe remarkable.   While I had my doubts, I am a fan and will be back during my visits to AZ!   Cheers...",

Atmosphere: pretty fun, nice/casual, great place to come grab dinner after work, 20s to 30s crowd really.   Surrounding area: as someone new to AZ, I thought downtown Tempe was really awesome! Lots to do/see.   Food: $2 tacos...can't beat that! The mahi mahi and carne asada tacos were my favorite. Knocked it down a couple stars because the other tacos I tried weren't as good as I'd expected so I definitely wouldn't want to pay full price for those. I'm from San Diego though so my expectations of tacos are pretty high!   Drinks: my friend ordered their signature margarita and she said it was pretty good but tasted a bit watered down. I stuck with water though.   Would most likely return. Maybe I'll try out the Scottsdale location next.",

I could care less about being separated. But being tossed into that category of low lifes... how is that not a huge insult to a customer.   I went back to confront them, to tell them that I took issue with the fact that I was accused of such a henious behavior, and they dismissed it as \"dude, get over the fact that you're not getting laid tonight\"  I'll never go here again. I get the sensitivity of sexual assualt, especially around a college campus, but being through it myself, and being accused of it myself almost brought me to tears...

I went again for happy hour with co-workers. Both times we were practically the only customers and the food was mediocre. I'm guessing this is a late night drink spot/hangout, so I can't comment on that vibe. I won't go out of my way to go here again.",

Where's the waitress? There's like 5 surrounding the POS station and bar but none seem concerned with seating us. Oh here's someone. A busboy perhaps?   We are finally seated. Drinks. Menu. Hmm, everything looks pretty good. Decently priced. We order chips and salsa. Comes out in a few minutes by the busboy who also sat us and took our drink order. The presentation is nice. Three small jars of various salsas with a plate of chips. Very light tortilla chips and they're good. Salsa is as well.   So we order... I'm thinkin,' \"man this place is huge and there seem to be way too many staff for how empty the place is but that means more attention, right?\" My empty cup says otherwise. Here comes the food. Kind of felt like it took a while, but again presentation looks good and I can't wait to eat.   Accurate assessment about the food. My chicken torta is really good. Bf says his is too. My fries look amazing. They have this cream drizzle and little shavings of green onion on top. Noms for days. Oh hell no, they're f$*^ing cold. And stiff and taste like cold gross potatoes. Awesome.   Where's the waitress? Oh there's one. Wait she's \"assigned\" to the other table. I watch her literally make eye contact with my bf's empty cup and walk away. I'm steaming hotter than my lame ass fries at this point. I finish half of my torta. Okay, we need a box. Then a homeless(?) kid comes up and asks for money. No but you can have the fries (with  face) Okay cool, he's down. Enjoy bro. I almost felt worse giving him the fries. He was grateful though. So win-win.   Anyway where the F is the waitress? I'm not even thirsty anymore. Like I don't want to even wait for her to come ask if we need more drinks to then watch her disappear and never be seen again. Then guess who comes back around. My favorite person in the world, the busboy. Can we have a box? Thanks. Bf walks up to pay cause I have shit to do today and have spent too long here already. ByeeeFelicia.   Had high hopes for this place. Food was sort of good but the service was horrible. Hospitality should be more of a focus. Damn if a place like that can survive just because of the bar and its location, I might as well try my hand at becoming a restauranteur too. Would never eat here again.",

I looked around and half the people inside were wearing solid tees and also the gentleman behind me was also wearing a black tee but was able to go in with no issues. I felt just because I'm a Mexican guy with a bald head and tattoos I was profiled as a gang banger and was not allowed to get in to a so called \"Mexican\" restaurant. Never judge a book by its cover people. I'm a dad of 5 kids and husband to a beautiful wife. I own my own home and make decent money but because of the way I look I wasn't allowed to get in. I will never be going to this place again and ill make sure to spread the word on how I was treated.",

He asked for my husband's ID and continuously kept looking him up and down as to find a reason not to let him in. I then stepped to the side of him and the racist security guard said he couldn't come in because of his shoes. I searched high and low for said dress code that stated what shoes a person can and cannot wear in their establishment, however the only dress code that was found stated \"casual wear.\" I sent an email to express my concerns and still have yet to receive a response. Due to this individual and no explanation from him of what shoes are accepted, date night was ruined.

El Hefe is one of those places where the food, atmosphere and service is consistently good. Of course you must enjoy Mexican food. And I do. Their tacos are flavorful and nicely presented on wooden serving trays. The food usually arrives before the first sip of beer is done.   The staff is very friendly. I'm greeted with smiles and hello's when ever I show up...which is frequent...precisely because of the exceptional service I receive. Any problems are handled promptly and without fuss. They clearly want a happy customer.  Kudos to Brandi, Hailey, Bella, Candace, Marissa, Brittini, Daney, Austin, Jamie, Marcel, Alexis...and others for great service.  I highly recommend it for the food and atmosphere...it's festive and fun. But what makes El Hefe the El Chingon...are the beautiful souls that work there.   One more thing...it turns into a totally insane nightclub after 10 pm...a bit much for this old dog...but for the young at heart it's one rocking affair.",

With regard to the food, it is probably better than Scottsdale, somehow. I had the mole enchiladas and they were incredible. I've had many different kinds of mole, including super authentic Queretaro style. This was very well crafted and better than any that I've had.
