First time I had Bosnian food and I really enjoyed everything. And my favorite is cevapi (sausage sandwich?). Well after the meal I love having some Turkish coffee too. Only thing I didn't like about the restaurant is there was no music. They should play some Bosnian or classic music for better atmosphere.",

Again I ordered the cabbage rolls.  The cabbage rolls were better than the previous day if that is possible. They are delicious!  The True star may just be the gyros sandwich, though. I loved my tasty and ample steak sandwich, but I was *this close* to stealing my partner's gyros sandwich. This Is The Place for gyros, folks! Omg!  We finished with the delightful Turkish coffee and our lovely server then brought us each a free dessert \"just because\".  We have such warm feelings for this place. It is on our rotation now. If you are curious you MUST try it!  We suggest the sausages, the bread and tyros and the desserts with Turkish coffee.",

    "text": "**Original review from 5/8/2011. Updating new profile.**  I live in the East Valley, so this place is not exactly convenient. I go there when I have the chance after visiting family on the west side. Tonight, I took my mother for the first time. She is in love with the place.  It's a small little cafe with a limited menu. However, this menu is perfect for the place. It's simple and delicious. Their zeljanica (spinach pastry similar to spanakopita) is damn near perfect. I've had their pileci (chicken sandwich) and it's so tender, juicy and friggin' addictive. My mother loved this so much she ordered an extra one to go so she could take it to work the next day. I have a feeling my gas budget is going to go up so I can take my mother here more often. It's quite a drive from East Mesa!  I ordered their Bosnian/Turkish coffee today for the first time. I loved it. Great flavor and my only complaint was that it was too late in the day to have another!   For my Muslim friends, I've asked if their meat is halal and sure enough, it is! I definitely recommend this place.  Their service and their food is excellent. The only reason why it didn't receive 5 stars from me was the fact that it's a little dirty there and the resident Bosnians of the place were making my son a little uneasy because they were staring at us a lot. My opinion? Who cares!!! I didn't go there to see if people were going to stare at me or not. I went there to experience food you do not normally find in the US, or particularly, AZ.",

Food is OK but service is something that is lacking. There was only one waitress that treat you Awesome and she is no longer there is  \"Maja\" . She is also an Canadian / Bosnian.  BTW will help you with the menu. Now let's get to why I think this place is only being rated as 1 Star. The owner just got married to an another Bosnian man with seem nice, but you can tell is all about citizenship  I also witness her the owner try to set up her waitress Maja up with men with money , even after she \"Owner\" was told she wasn't interested in any of her Bosnian men. To this today she still try to set her up with men to make money off of her. Really this America,  I believe she the owner needs to have a Vista from INS and let see how she really runs this business.  So if you are married and your wife is good looking, keep her a way from here.  It a hole in the wall in the middle of Crack haven.  Watch your cars and all your belongings.",

    "text": "I had never had Bosnian food before, but I was waiting for CVS to fill my prescription and had an hour to kill, so I turned to my trusty Yelp mobile app to see what was in the area. Caffe Sarajevo was in the area and I was up for a new experience.  Once I located the resultant (not far from 35th & Northern intersection) I was a little skeptical judging from the outside of the restaurant. Don't let that hold you up - go inside. When I did I was surprised.  It was big and had an excellent decor. The server was very friendly and quickly brought out the Turkish coffee that I started with. I have never had Turkish coffee, but the reviews talked about it so I ordered it. The photo describing it as mud is accurate. It was very thick. The server said \"this is the real stuff\".  What to order at a restaurant where one is unfamiliar with any food from the region? Again, the prior reviews led the way. Each talked about the cevapci, so that's what I went with. Wow! It was great - it came with sour cream and a relish with excellent flavor.  A large helping of onions ensured I wouldn't be kissing passersby... The sandwich was large bread that was soft, warm, and flakey and loaded down with little sausages. It tasted like a gyro, which is to be expected since other reviews indicate it is beef & lamb. The server checked up on my a few times to make sure I was enjoying the meal.   This may have been my first experience, but it will not be my last. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the area.",

He walks up and asks us what do  we want to drink with the most I don't care if you are here look on his face then turns and walks away. He comes  back drops off the drinks then asks what do you want to eat once again stood there with a blank look on his face we asked questions about items on the menu did not get a response we managed to order he turned and walked away with out a word. The food comes out drops it off never to return. Now for the food wife had spinach and cheese pita I had the cevapi sausage sandwich dad had the Pljeskavica they were good overall food was decent but the real turnoff is Mr personality sorry but just can't get over that. I'm sure he is related to someone in the restaurant or worse owns it.Sir try a conversation you actually might sell more food if customers felt welcome and were helped with items on the menu.

    "text": "A really interesting cultural experience that would be lost on most people driving by. It is tiny and drab outside.  Who knew? Thanks, Yelp, and thanks Max A for making me laugh and want to try this place.  Walking in the door you will find yourself transported to another world.  Authentic music, cute European decor, and a Bosnian hostess/waitress/owner who will bend over backwards to make sure you are pleased.  Bosnian cuisine appears to be a blending of Eastern European and Middle Eastern culture (as is their music).  The items on this small menu were mostly simple fare, like simple hearty soups, sausage sandwiches, and chicken dishes.  First of all, I command you to eat the bread that comes with your meal. It is probably one of the finest, freshest, lightest, butteriest you could ever hope to sink your teeth into.  It is similar in texture to a beautifully executed croissant. A bowl of soup with a basket of that bread (well maybe two baskets) and I could die with a smile on my face.  The bowl of soup we had was a hearty bean soup, with large chunks of meat, most likely the sausage they use in their sandwiches. Yum.  I would love to try them all. $5 a bowl.  The sandwich, cevapi, is huge, with a multitude of little rolled sausages (seasoned beef + lamb) in the middle of that wonderful bread. It came with raw onion, sour cream and a red bell pepper sauce on the side. It is one heck of a sandwich. You might want to share! $8 gets you the large one.  The cabbage rolls were uncommonly good. Filled with seasoned meat and rice, then rolled in cabbage leaves, a serving consisted of three, baked in a light yet tangy sauce that appeared to have some vinegar and paprika.  Very flavorful, very filling. The dish was accompanied with a side of excellent mashed potatoes topped with sour cream. $5  Mr. B could not take his eyes off the little deli case.  Filled with tubes of imported sausages, some fresh, some dry, and most importantly, darkly smoked steaks. We asked about tasting the smoked meat, and she brought us a small plate with some very thin slices to taste. Really beautiful, tender but firm meat like a lovely prosciutto, a charcuterie's dream. We had to have some to bring home. A pound cost us $16 and was already shrink wrapped. But what will I do when we run out?  And here is where I must stop.  Only because they had just finished making a fresh batch of baklava and it was way too hot to cut yet.  She apologized profusely. I was broken hearted.  Not that I really needed it but.....  A delightful place for a culinary adventure, but no frills. Thanks for a lovely experience.",

    "text": "When you step into this quaint restaurant it appears that you truly are stepping into a small Bosnian town complete with Bosnian Natives. You see doorways and Bosnian artifacts. It's sort of like Disney Land. The menu is very meat and bread heavy so you have to plan for that. I had a chicken sandwich made with their house made bread. The bread was unlike any bread I had before and had a similar texture to a fluffy glazed donut and was tasty but a little greasy. My chicken was pounded very thin but was tender, juicy and seasoned well. I had added mushrooms and ajvar (roasted red pepper and eggplant condiment) to my sandwich. The ajvar seemed fresh made and was very mild. They gave me a generous amount of mushrooms that lacked caramelization. The sandwich was tasty but is a lot of bread so I ate it open faced so I wouldn't eat too much bread.  My husband had a cup of bean soup that was very porky and the popular spicy beef sausage sandwich. The sausage is skinless and is spicy but not very spicy.   Since it was our first time here our waitress wouldn't let us leave without trying a Bosnian Candy. She gave us a chocolate covered candy that looked like a banana. It tasted like a banana flavored circus peanut that was chocolate covered.  Among the most interesting restaurants to try because it was like a trip to Bosnia.",

The decor is very cool. Its made to look like a little village w/ pieces from Bosnia all over the place. We were seated at a large booth in the back. Our server was wonderful. He was extremely attentive and was more than happy to chat w/ us and answer our questions.  The menu is full of very warm, homey food. Sausages, and bread and stew and man, it is cheap! I decided on the stew (and it was not small). It was warm and flavorful and reminded me of something my grandfather would make that his mother would make for him. Lots of tender meat, root veggies and even some cabbage. It came w/ a large warm piece of bread. And im not ashamed to say i used it to clean my plate. It was a good amount of food. For $5.45. Yup, super cheap. Didnt I say that?  The really disappointing thing about this place is that we were the only table. Otherwise the restaurant was dead. It made me so sad! Their food is amazing!

    "text": "I checked out this place for the International Supper Club UYE.  I love checking out food from around the world, in the US and in it's native land.  So, this was cool.  I've never been to Bosnia.  I wondered what the food could be like because Bosnia is a literally cultural melting pot with Mediterranean, European and Middle Eastern influences.  I was eager to give it a try and see if any of those 3 cultures dominated the influence on the food.    You might drive past the tiny shopping plaza in which this restaurant is located.  Why you ask?  Because it is about as nondescript as a traffic light, except you pay attention to the traffic light.  It's also a rather run down plaza and is not attractive.  No worries, pull in to that parking lot and yeah, you'll look around like, \"where is Ursula sending me.....?????\"  Seriously, go inside.  You'll quickly realize that you've escaped the ho' hum and entered eastern Europe.   The inside of that restaurant is so neatly decorated, you feel like you're in eastern Europe.    Fortunately, I was with a great group of yelpers.  I teamed up with Preston S to split our entrees.  He ordered the Pljeskavica and I ordered the Cevapi.  Both of these items are served on the tastiest, flakiest, buttery pastry type bread I've had in quite some time.  The Pljeskavica was a 4-star item with a the beef patty, mushrooms and cheese on that flaky pastry-like bun.  I would order this item again!  The Cevapi was somewhat like a kabob, but really reminded me of Jimmy Dean Breakfast sausages in appearance.  But NOT in taste.  These small sausages are made of beef and lamb and are seasoned with Bosnian spices.  This was a 3-star item for me.    If I ever get back over there, I MUST try the burek.   I have a feeling that I will enjoy that immensely!    Unfortunately, any place that serves dinner, but not wine generally gets a one-star-off from me.  This could have been a 4-star review from me!  I wonder if you can do a BYOB.  I have to keep in mind that no booze could be a religious choice as well.  so I'm giving them a 3.5 instead of taking the whole 1 star.  I always bump 3.5 star reviews to 4 stars.",

It was very quiet and I was never greeted. When it was my turn to pay the blonde girl working was super rude and extremely short with me. Not a friendly person I'd have interacting with customer if I owned a food establishment.She had the personality of an angry dishwasher. Maybe it was because I'm a normal looking \"American\" guy that doesn't speak Bosnian. Again, I enjoyed the food but that girl working there left a bad taste in my mouth.",

I decided on the Cevapi, it was a Bosnian sausage sandwich that came with sliced red onions, sour cream, which I swear was freshly made, and some sort of veggie spread. Let me tell you, this sandwich was A-MAZ-ING! I am a bread freak, love the stuff, this bread was fresh and rustic, the sausage were so tasty and with the veggie spread & sour cream spread across the bread, you have just made yourself an amazing delicious bit of heaven!

    "text": "This is not a place I came to because it was recommended by friends, or because I read a review, or because some guy on TV with spikey orange hair says it is off the hook.  No, I was on my way to the going out of business sale at the furniture store down the street and just happened to see the sign and it just happened to be time for an early dinner and I just happened to be hungry.  I don't usually Yelp a place AFTER I choose it and have already been seated to eat but in this case I had a deer in the headlights look as I was reading the short but comprehensive menu and I needed to check Yelp to see if there was anything that was a \"do NOT miss this\" menu item.  Turns out I didn't have time to get any further than to see the place had a 4.8 rating when the very tall (like in basketball player tall) waiter came over and helped us with his suggestions of what were the best choices for first-time Bosnian food virgins.  The waiter was a bit shy but he seemed like a super-nice guy. More on all that later in this review when I talk about service.  But first let's cut to the chase ... the food his is off the hook (sorry) awesome and ridiculously cheap.  I grew up on middle-European foods so much of what Old Town Sarajevo serves has a family resemblance to the foods I'm familiar with, just different names and different presentations.  At the waiter's suggestion I had the smallest order of the Cevapi, which are Bosnian sausages stuffed inside a gigantic thick puffy pita called Lepinja.  At only $5 this qualifies for are-you-kidding-me-cheap.  It alone would make a very filling meal. The sandwich is a little odd, sort of like if you were to put a few cocktail weenies into a big soft pita. The Cevapi was served with a side of raw onions, Ajvar, which is a creamy roasted red pepper paste (delicious) and sour cream.  Because I am used to stuffed cabbage rolls I tried those as well, also $5.00, and again one serving could be an entire meal. They are the best I've ever had except for my grandmother's.  I've posted photos of the Cevapi and cabbage rolls so you can see what I'm talking about.  I need to shout out the Lepinja bread too. I'm not a big bread eater but I could eat that delicious stuff all day. I understand it is fresh-baked.  Now let's get to the service. I note that every negative review ignores talking about the food and bashes the service. Here's my take on that in two parts: first, I've always believed that the way people treat you is a reflection of the way you present yourself. Do I even have to go into detail about how rude and boorish some restaurant customers can be? Often that gets magnified when loud obnoxious Americans mix with quieter, more soft-spoken people from other cultures. And second, in my international travels and discoveries of unique family-owned ethnic restaurants like this one the owners and staff are not as polished as you would find in a snooty Rodeo Drive restaurant and often English comes as a difficult second language for them. So they are not being rude but, like our waiter, they come across as shy and reserved using words very sparingly.  I pretty much ignore all of the negative reviews that choose to go to a place like this and then complain about the hard-working staff or that the decor isn't fancy.  If someone can't review the food why bother posting a review?  Bottom line - this is a solid 5-star place based on what counts, the awesome food and ridiculous low prices.",

We both had Cevapi, but he ordered chicken soup with it, while I ordered a side of stuffed cabbage. Everything was fantastic, especially the bread!  For dessert, he ordered baklava and I tried the Turkish Coffee. We both were so impressed, we are planning to be frequent visitors here!    Also, our experience with the waitstaff was wonderful as well.  We explained we didn't know much about Bosnian food or culture, and our waiter assisted us with food recommendations, and also played some great Bosnian music as well. Was a great evening!",

We over-ate trying different things. Oh my, not sure what our favorite was; cabbage rolls, cabbage stew, and some kind of a sausage sandwich. How they manage to come up with such unique amazing flavor is beyond me but can't wait to bring friends n family!! And the homemade bread is nothing like we've ever had. Simply amazing, simply incredible!!",

I was the last one sitting at the table when everyone got up, still eating my food.  This was not a pleasant experience.

The server, who had the sloppiness of a self dressed 3 year old there who claims to be new and doesn't know the menu, also claims to be the manager. Go figure.   We sat down at 715 and walked out by 9, that's how long it took for our meal. I ordered 5 pieces of byrek and the waitress brought it up on herself to only bring out 3 because she said it was too much food for the amount of people I had.......ummmmm okay. So I said that I still wanted the original order of my 5 total and then she said they didn't have any more. So basically lied to my face about it.  Amongst the other issues that happened that evening, I got my salad at the end of the meal,  after I got my check by the way! So I proceeded to explain that I didn't want the salad because we were already leaving and she refused to take it off of my check even though I literally received it after I got my check, i figured fine I'll deal with it. Then she charged me for all 5 pieces of byrek when I only received 3. She solved this issue by telling me I ordered 5 so that's what she charged me for, even though I only received 3. I also ordered a $9 plate and she charged me $10 for it. Basically she was so incompetent that she couldn't look at the menu and charge me the prices that were right there in front of her face. When she refused to just take a second look at my check so I could show her that i clearly had gotten over charged , she handed me a business card and told me to call her another day because she was done talking to me about what the issue was. Luckily I had cash so i paid her for exactly what i had ordered.  The whole scenario of a Bosnian themed place is mediocre,  it looks dirty and not well kept. They had sesame street, wrapping paper table cloths, who the hell uses wrapping paper as a table cloth. The table was dirty when we sat down, mind you we were the only table they had initially. There was an employee drinking beer while he was working. This place was a disaster. It's extremely pitiful because the food wasn't half bad but i can not tell you how horrible these employees were especially the waitress who could not even comprehend a 9 key register and spoke 25% of the English language. She should seriously be in the back of the store so you wouldn't have to see that horrible wretched face of hers. I'm in the same line of work, and if I ever treated someone who came to my restaurant with that kind of utter disrespect I would fire myself! !",

However, the pictures and reviews on here quickly eased my worries.  All the reviews on here are spot on.  The food is unique and delicious.  My only complaint was the service.  The hostess/waitress/server/busser (owner?) was very difficult to flag down.  Once you got your meal and beverage - that was it.  You had to lock eyes with her and wave your hands as she scurried around the dining room so she would come over to the table so you could order a refill, order something else, get the check, etc.  The place was pretty dead but it was almost impossible to get her attention even as she passed right by the table.  Very weird.  As we were the only Americans there, it seemed as if we didn't speak the language she didn't really care.  She was very friendly though when we were able to get her attention.  Cevapi = excellent although I'm not a fan of the raw onions Kebab = excellent Pileci = excellent Sirnica = excellent Baklava = sweet and delicious  I thought the food was very unique, delicious and reasonably priced.  The entire experience of trying a new cuisine in a new part of town was worth the drive.  So, all-in-all my dining experience was a good one. If I ever again have a hankering for Bosnian food, I will return.",

We went Friday night & our gourmet group tried like the dickens to get our waitress to laugh, but it was not to be. She was SO nice, but the same as we found in Prague, Slovakia and Russia, laughing with \"strangers\" is viewed as sort of phony.  (we got it from our Russian tour guide.. they don't get all the early, stranger to stranger glad handing we do in the U.S.. they just don't.) Takes 'em time to warm up to people which is probably more natural and not as \"car salesman-ish\" which is how many there view this behavior of ours that WE see as the only way to be. Hey, different cultures have different customs, right?  So relax.. it's all good!   Anyway, nuff said on that... Here is the upshot of the food!  It's beyond fabulous and SO inexpensive we couldn't believe it.. for what you got!  And the bread.. like everyone said.. SHEEEZ.. baybaaay... that is totally addictive!!  I am going back tomorrow!   So is the stuffed cabbage (sarma) which we all loved!  Hearty, not too spicy.. just like all the eastern Eur.food my hubby and I have had.  It's substantial, and yet not much more than salt and pepper for spice.  Last thing... the decor is sooo cool. I loved the one review calling it \"Narnia.\"  It IS! Or \"Hobbitown!\"  Just go.

We had the cevapi (sausages, be sure to get the sour cream and pepper sauce offered), a couple of pitas (croissant-like, filled with meat or cheese), Turkish/Bosnian coffee, and samplers of the desserts (my dining buddy had never liked baklava--but now she does).  The. breads. are. awesome.  We agreed they're not like any we've had before, and we're pretty well-traveled foodies.

This was our first visit, so we ordered an extra dish to make sure we had ample leftovers.  Bosnian sausage, chicken sandwich, and a gyros sandwich. All delicious.  The chicken soup and desserts (baklava and a piece of the egg-white meringue-like cake) were also very good.  And the prices are great, especially considering the portions are fairly large!  They have done a lot of decorating in Bosnian style (or at least I assume it was Bosnian - as I have never been there), with the walls decorated to look like old European-style doors with porch overhangs.  Cute.  The only odd thing was that half of the tables in the restaurant have chairs that have \"Tropical Smoothie\" etched into their backs.  I assume that at some point the cafe must have expanded and acquired another restaurants furniture.  Their other furniture is nicer.  It's as if they have lunch tables and dinner tables.  The 'dinner' tables have table cloths and nicer chairs.  The only real negative was that there was a big group and when they weren't actively eating they were so loud it was hard to carry on our own conversation even though we were a few tables away.  But the food more than made up for it.  We will definitely recommend to others or return, ourselves, if we're in Phoenix again.",

    "text": "I discovered this place, on Yelp, by accident. I was searching some other item and this came up. I read the reviews and decided to try it. What luck!   I met a buddy, a fellow food nut, for lunch here on a Saturday. There were a handful of people in the joint, including the small group in the back, who seemed to go out of there way to not notice us. We were not greeted right away, and had to ask the host/waiter if we should just pick a table. You definitely feel like an outsider walking into this place if you have never been there before.   After we got seated, the friendly waiter gave us a few menus and took our drink order. We were only drinking water and he returned promptly with two small bottles of water. Noticing that we looked unfamiliar, the waiter asked if this was our first time here. We said yes and he proceed to thoroughly explain the menu. This was great since I wasn't really sure what I was getting into here. My friend and I both ordered the Cevapi (sausage sandwich) with onions. I ordered the large and my buddy ordered the ex-large. We both added the sour cream & the pepper spread.   While we were waiting I noticed the decor & atmosphere of the place. The loud Bosnian music playing and the hand painted murals on the walls. I even noticed the plaques on the wall from the local soccer teams (my son is a soccer player). The small bar in the rear of the place was visited by a few Bosnian looking people speaking what I can only assume was Bosnian. The shelves behind the register were full of what appeared to be Bosnian goods. It was all very nice and added to the experience.   Our food arrived and was amazing. The sausages, my friend and I agreed, were possibly a beef & lamb mixture. They were very tasty, and reminded me of the Armenian food I had tried once in California. I was a little disappointed to find out that they didn't use their own recipe for the sausages (shipped from CA), but was happy with them non the less. The bread was wonderful. The first bite took me by surprise. I compared it to a cross between a pita and Indian Fry Bread. The onions were served raw. I am not a raw onion guy (grilled is the best) but they did compliment the sandwich. The sour cream was standard issue and the pepper spread had a red bell pepper, possibly tomato taste to it that was also a good compliment. I should have gone for the ex-large though. Having a big appetite myself, I left feeling like I could have eaten a little more.   Overall I was very happy with the food and hope to return to try some of the other fare. The service was what you would expect from a small place with only one waiter/ host, but the gentlemen was very informative and friendly. The atmosphere was nice and a little out of the ordinary, which I enjoy. The prices were pretty good I guess. My lunch bill came to just under $10. If you are looking for fine dining this is not it, but if you are looking for someplace different with good food this IS it.",

She even knew the owner (at least I think she was the owner) pretty well.   As a tiny grocery store, they have some really fantastic items that I've never found elsewhere. From candy to cured meats, it's all pretty impressive. As a restaurant, the food is great. It's all very rich and pretty accessible for American palates. They serve Turkish coffee which is this pretty amazing mud.  Ambiance here is a little third world, but that's part of the experience. I felt pretty welcome, but I was being escorted by an insider. I have found it a little intimidating to return by myself (plus, it's just really kinda far), but as friendly as they are I can't imagine I'd be beaten and dragged into the back or anything... though I don't know why I just thought of that as a possibility.

When we walked in, we noticed that we appeared to be the only non-Bosnian people there.  This little nondescript hole-in-the-wall only seats about 20 people.  Our waiter patiently explained the menu and made what turned out to be *excellent* suggestions.  However, the portions were so big, we both took boxes of leftovers home.  They weren't busy, so we're a little nervous -- we want this place to succeed, because we want to keep going back for more.  I've already recommended Sarajevo to some friends.  UPDATE:   My latest visit (last night), I had the Gyro Sammich.  Serious YUM!  This time, we we the only customers in the place.  The food is soooo good, and the people are so nice, WHY aren't you Yelpers doing your part?  ;-)  Go there.  Fill this place up.  Eat.  Enjoy.  I have selfish reasons for wanting this Sarajevo Cafe to be full of customers.  No, I don't own a piece of it.  I like the food, and I want to know that it's doing well, so I will know that it's there.  This is seriously good food, people.  Your stomach will tell you that I told you the truth.",

    "text": "Vegetarians need not apply; the only salad you will find here is a pile of grilled onions!  Seriously, this place is comfort food heaven.  I ordered a chicken sandwich, a large cevapi (which I can only think means \"delicious spicy meat fingers\" in Bosnian) sandwich, a cheese pita, and a spinach pita.  I can't really put my finger on what makes the food so good, other than it's straight up comfort food that sticks to your ribs and makes you wish all pants came with elastic waistbands.  The restaurant itself is out of this world; no seriously, it's like walking into some small Bosnian hole-in-the-wall.  What it lacks in amenities it makes up in character; you've got soccer playing on the TV and this 70's eastern European techno playing in the background while a bunch of men chat away in the back of the shop.  The best way to describe it is Star Wars Cantina scene meets National Geographic.  Don't worry about feeling like an outsider, nobody pays attention to the confused and worried look on your face unless it's the gracious and friendly host.  ;)  Anyway, back to the food.  The chicken sandwich was perfectly seasoned and cooked, while the meaty Bosnian sausages put Jimmy Dean and his family to shame.  I recommend using the Kobayashi method on these dishes; meat first, bread second.  Oh, and don't forget to ask for some ajvar (tart red-pepper sauce) to dress your sausages with.  The bread shouldn't be ignored though since it is thick, rich, and hearty.  The pitas are not pitas in the Middle-Eastern/Greek sense, they're more like stuffed fillo pies and they're just as delicious as the rest of the entrees.  By the way, the portions are quite large and make a Hungry Man frozen dinner look (and taste) like a McD's Happy Meal.  Actually, if McD could make their McNuggets even remotely taste like Sarajevo's cevapi, they would rule the world.  In all seriousness though, this is simply awesome comfort food at an uber affordable price.  Although I must admit that I was so in love with my plate that I may have snarled and showed my teeth to innocent bystanders who got too close.  Regardless, I definitely recommend this place if you want to try something (as Cheech and Chong would say) that's the same as your favorite comfort food but different.  I would write more but the food coma has completely taken me over.  Post Scriptum:  I believe my stomach just did a happy dance and passed out.",

The same reason I love them--they are geared towards the immigrant community--can also lead to stares that never cease throughout one's meal as the rest of the crowd tries to figure out if you are part of the community somehow, and if not, why did you come?  When my friend and I first walked in to Cafe Sarajevo, the record skidded off the player so to speak. All the middle-aged Bosnian men smoking at the bar turned around as did the crew of Bosnian teens. Thankfully, the owner quickly saw our timid looks and came over with a big smile and a lot of information and recommendations about Bosnian cuisine. The stares stopped.   I ordered an excellent chicken sandwich on this incredibly thick, rich Bosnian bread called Lepinja, while I tried some pretty good Bosnian soda. The portions were huge. Bosnian television played the whole time. For desert, most of the selections available were classical French pastry.   In addition to the amazing food, the small cafe also includes a small selection of imported Bosnian goods for purchase. Bosnian food is hard to find even in the New Yorks and L.A.'s of the world, so take full advantage!",

I have traveled to the former Jugoslavia innumerable times over the past 30 years and the food at this establishment does not reflect the authentic foods, flavors, or serving style of Sarajevo or any of the other area's of which it claims.  I had such high hopes based on the other posted reviews and was incredibly disappointed by the poor service and lack of authenticity.  Please know that experiencing the \"real\" thing would be worth your while if you ever have a chance to travel.  I would feel so badly for anyone to experience this cafe and say....ewww, I guess we should never travel there....because this cafe is NOTHING like the real thing.  Our bill was app. $80.00 btw...so yes...I gave several dishes a taste, in search of something authentic, with no luck.  The service left MUCH to be desired, and waiting 45 minutes for a pre-made, cold dessert is rather ridiculous, but the perfect ending to indicate that we should not suffer through the experience's provided by this cafe again.",

All three items were extremely delicious. You receive an abundance of food for a little of nothing. I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants to try something a little out of the norm.",

It's a little hole-in-the-wall joint in a random shopping center, but as soon as you step inside it's like being transported halfway around the world.    We went for dinner on Saturday night and shared Cevapi (a must have, as other reviewers have commented), stuffed cabbage, spinach pita, and homestyle soup w/ beef.  Prices are very reasonable; menu items range from $3-$9 and the $9 ones could feed a family!  I don't have any complaints about the service; don't know what other people were whining about quite frankly.  The staff was attentive, our food was brought out in a timely manner, and the owner's son, visiting from New Jersey, stopped by to chat it up with us and brought us a Bosnian cola drink which was fantastic.  I will definitely be back with my daughter, and everyone who ever comes to visit me in Phoenix!",

Tonight, I took my mother for the first time. She is in love with the place.  It's a small little cafe with a limited menu. However, this menu is perfect for the place. It's simple and delicious. Their zeljanica (spinach pastry similar to spanakopita) is damn near perfect. I've had their pileci (chicken sandwich) and it's so tender, juicy and friggin' addictive. My mother loved this so much she ordered an extra one to go so she could take it to work the next day. I have a feeling my gas budget is going to go up so I can take my mother here more often. It's quite a drive from East Mesa!  I ordered their Bosnian/Turkish coffee today for the first time. I loved it. Great flavor and my only complaint was that it was too late in the day to have another!   For my Muslim friends, I've asked if their meat is halal and sure enough, it is! I definitely recommend this place.  Their service and their food is excellent. The only reason why it didn't receive 5 stars from me was the fact that it's a little dirty there and the resident Bosnians of the place were making my son a little uneasy because they were staring at us a lot. My opinion? Who cares!!! I didn't go there to see if people were going to stare at me or not. I went there to experience food you do not normally find in the US, or particularly, AZ.",

We tried several different items off the menu since it was out first time eating this type of cuisine - the cevapi, stuff cabbage rolls, and soup were AWESOME!!!  The only part that could use improvement was the poor customer service.  The server seemed to be more concerned with hanging out with his friends who were eating in the restaurant.  He forgot to bring us several different items, the timing of the food was way off, he wasn't very helpful when we told him we had never eaten this type of food and asked for suggestions, and he never came back to check on us or ask us how the food was...  The food rating here is A+, but the customer service here is a less than desirable C+ for newbies to Bosnian food ...but check out the other reviews on here for all the various DEEEE-LICOUS food items to try.  The prices are extremely reasonable for the amount and quality of food that you get, which makes up for the lack of decent customer service!",

    "text": "Update: Does this restaurant still have you pay for water?  EDIT: I changed this review to one star and you will read later in the review that they charged me for something I didn't order and this......whatever it was for my 6 year old (which I thought was complimentary because we didn't order it). I thought it was another kebab sandwich that he gave my husband and I. It was not. Check it out.  Really surprised by the amount of stars this place has. The location for one is not in the nicest of places. The little plaza is worn down and there was one open parking spot to this restaurant directly in front of it. All the others were reserved for the surrounding stores. I came about 48 minutes before closing so it might have just been that I've seen the restaurant at night and need to come by the day time to have a different opinion. The inside actually surprised me. Gorgeous traditional paintings and pictures. Lots of textures and fixtures that give you a sense of being somewhere else. The INSIDE of this restaurant is clean and I have no complaints.  My husband and I ordered one chicken soup, two gyro kebabs and baklava. That is a total of 4 items. The waiter asked what we would like to drink, I said water. 3 waters. Now, waters are usually given in a glass cup and are free and unlimited. He came out with three bottles of water. I didn't ask why he came out but I was under the impression that I was going to pay for them, or he just didn't want to bother with the hassle of pouring liquid in to a glass. Either way, I was at peace with the idea and moved on. In the end though, we did get charged for all three bottles of water.  I would like to add that when I go somewhere for the very first time, I don't like to question their way of serving or what they give out when I have ordered. He came out with 3 gyros in sandwich form. I'm thinking our kebabs are different because I was expecting meat on a stick. Instead they were sausages in between two pieces of bread. I don't know why we got three but I didn't question that either. He gave the third sandwich to my tiny 6 year old who didn't touch it. He's picky and I usually let him try the food we eat, other than that I would have to blend vegetables in to our foods for him at home. He came out with the chicken soup which had okra and not chicken. He also came out with the baklava. Which was drenched in liquid sugar. I mean soaking. Was the food good? It was mediocre. If it was phenomenal I wouldn't care so much for the service. Expensive? Yes. If you order water by the bottle and receive food you didn't order and pay to just leave. I felt like he didn't give me the opportunity to feel comfortable. I just felt like I didn't want to insult him even though he up charged me for everything! I left an $8 tip because I'm generous but I won't be coming back.",

The sausage cevapi is what I ordered and it was basically sausage smashed between two crepe-like buns served with sour cream and a Bosian relish.  I was hoping for a different flavor profile, but the sausage was fairly generic and I even ordered the spicy version.  The only joint I can compare to this locally is Beaver Choice - and while I know they're not the same, at least at Beaver Choice almost every menu item comes with side dishes that give you a better idea of the culture they're representing.  This was simply sausage and bread, somewhat blase.  Grabbed a couple of Bosnian beers but they were basically a more expensive flavored Peroni - which went well with the cevapi.  I wouldn't argue if someone wanted to go back, but with so many choices in Phoenix I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to come back.",

I haven't had authentic burek like that since I last visited Montenegro back in 2015 during the summertime. It's my absolute favorite meal. The burek sa mesom (meat) is the best! They even have the Turkish coffee which is a huge plus.  The inside is decorated beautifully! On top of that, they were playing folk music and the few people in the restaurant were all speaking the language. I felt like I transported for a bit.  I couldn't stop smiling!

Although the Yelp menu lists Mali as 5.00 they've upped the price to 7.50. The cheese pita might be the same 4.00, close to it. Every time I order over the phone they say \"you want everything on it, sour cream and veggie spread?\" And I say yes although those 2 items always came with it in the past.  I went to pick up my order and it was $2 more than usual. I have experienced slight variances in price (one time it was $1 less than usual for some reason) but it is consistent enough for me to notice a difference. I asked about the change and he said \"sour cream and veggie spread are extra\". I explained that this has never been the case and he pointed to the menu where it lists the prices to order them as sides. I reiterated that it's never happened before but said I guess it that's what they need to do, but I probably wouldn't be back. He interrupted me to wave and say goodbye to other customers. I've put up with feeling the awkward stares of walking in there being the only person not of their culture/friend group/family and with their high prices for the great food, which is why this review is 2 stars instead of 1. But if you're going to make up new rules and be inflexible about $2 for a consistent customer...I suppose you no longer have one. But I'm sure it's neat hanging out with your crew all day and glaring at newcomers. Enjoy, I honestly feel like I'm going to get mugged or catch a disease outside the building every time I come so good riddance.",

No sauce or condiments on it but it was delicious & didn't need anything else. The Spinach Pita was very tasty as well. A little different than the spanakopita in a Greek restaurant.

    "text": "Cevapi: Greasy, crispy, savory, chewy, and a must try if you're a bread and sausage person.  The bread's crispy exterior and chewy interior (almost like the interior of an English muffin) are fantastic.  I have to stress that it's very greasy though, so make sure you have napkins as you tear off pieces of bread to wrap the little sausages in.  Definitely best when it's hot and fresh.  It gets more greasy and less flavorful if you let it cool for a while.  The small size was huge!  Baklava: Decent but I've had better.  It's definitely solid and not as high priced as some other places, but my piece wasn't as flakey and crispy as I would like, and the layers were more dense and wet than I would prefer.  Tulumba: A surprisingly good donut of light cruller-like dough soaked in a simple sugar syrup and served cold.  I had let mine sit for a while in its to-go container so it was soaked through with watery simple syrup but still mostly chilled.  I didn't mind the sogginess myself.  There was a GIANT (filling one of the adjoined dining rooms) group but the waitress was able to squeeze my to-go order out without too long of a wait.  She also offered me a glass of water as I waited, which I appreciated.  The decor was a lot nicer than I was expecting too.  They have a selection of Milka and other international brand chocolate bars for sale at the register.  It's nice to have something different from the preponderance of Mexican, Italian, Chinese, and burger places that seem to dominate this area.  A definite must try for bread-and-meat connoisseurs!  Just be warned about the greasiness.  I had a bit of a stomachache later in the day which may have been from this.  Edit: Taking the rating down a few stars because the stomach issues afterwards were awful.  Food poisoning from undercooked sausage perhaps?",

Been a couple times now and have to say Caffe Sarajevo is one of favorite new (for me) places to grab a bite.  The Cevapi sandwhich is the star of this place and it is fantastic.  Its delicate, soft bread filled with some of the tastiest sausages I may have ever had.  I assure you if you get this you cant go wrong.  Other than that Ive had the cheese pita which is a great little side of more delicate bread but filled with cheese.    Overall its a perfect and True hidden gem that is deserving of its rating.

Found this place on yelp by typing in \"halal\" and I couldn't have been more surprised or happier!   The owner verified the meat is halal several times.   We tried the stuffed cabbage (stuffed with rice and smokey beef, topped with sour cream) which was my favorite dish, the spinach burek, beef burek and the spicy sausage with bread. Everything was phenomenal and full of flavor. The stuffed cabbage was my favorite though - it's similar to a dish we Arabs have called Malfouf, but is actually way, way better.   The Turkish coffee was spot on as well- they serve it with little creamers and sugar on the side and since I have never had it with cream before I had to try it.. And loved it!   Everything came out to I believe less than $30, a total steal.   The next time I'm in Phoenix I WILL be back!",

    "text": "Every one that I've ever brought to this restaurant has not been disappointed. Bosnian food just sounds exotic, but once you have it, you get hooked!!!  If you like extraordinary good food, you won't gripe too much about the slow service. And it's insanely cheap. Nothing on the menu is over $9.00!   This place seems legit because you see native Bosnians eating there a lot. Several times, we've come to eat, and there will be a large group of Bosnians celebrating a birthday or something.  If you're going for the first time, order the following:  Veal Hot Dog or a regular cevapi sandwich, or the spicy cevapi sandwich The cheese pita Both the tulumba and the baklava for dessert Finish your meal with a Turkish coffee.   The sandwiches all come on this heavenly bread. They're like light croissants filled with homemade meat sausages. Add the chopped onions to the sandwich; definitely schmear on the red sauce. It's made out of red bell peppers, but has a nice creamy texture. The portion sizes are incredibly large! If you order the large, either share with someone or get a to-go box.   I really like the Bosnian soup. It's like a very comforting and savory stew. The meat chunks are really tender, and it's chock full of vegetables. It comes with bread to dip into the soup. It's filling without making you feel incredibly bloated afterwards. I've been able to work out after eating it; bc it's a good balance of protein and healthy carbs, I definitely recommend it!   My cousin's an executive chef and so he really appreciates good food. It's not easy to impress someone who cooks food for others as a living. We had him join us for dinner, and he said that everything was fresh. So fresh that he said he could smell the yeast in the bread. And the restaurant doesn't smell on the inside at all, unlike a Subway.   This place is a True gem; I only bring people I really like to this place.",

We had the following:  Pileci / Chicken Sandwich Cevapi Mali / Bosnian Sausage Sandwich Domaca salata Zelena salata  The food was good.  The only thing is that it is a bit of a drive from where I live in Mesa AZ.  It is worth trying.  If this place were closer to me, I would go back again.  The only thing that my wife mentioned was that the food was slightly heavy.  You can see and taste the Turkish and the Central European influences in the Bosnian food.  It is difficult to classify it as similar to Turkish or to Central European, as it has both influences present in it.    I do not know if the restaurant is Caffe Sarajevo or if it is Old Town Sarajevo.  The sign out front says it is Old Town Sarajevo, yet the address matches that of Caffe Sarajevo.  We found it regardless, and it really does not matter.  But it can be confusing.  Regardling the neighborhood, it is not too shifty.  It is not a bad neighborhood unlike what some of the people who have posted have said.",

    "text": "I ate alone at Sarajevo May 3, 2017, for the first time, after seeing Old Town Sarajevo reviewed on Check Please.  I read these reviews on Yelp BEFORE going. Some excerpts are in the \"Not recommended reviews\" link at the bottom: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/old-town-sarajevo-phoenix?start=20\">yelp.com/biz/old-town-sa...</a> \"the menu prices suddenly change when you pay. The receipt I received was higher than what was on the menu.\" \"Make sure you GET A TICKET with what you ordered written on it or they will get it wrong in the end.\" \"Seida Turulja (owner) has overcharged us big time for food. She not only charged extra 1 dollar per every order and drink but she also charged 6 dollars for unknown order\".  ...... However there were so many good reviews about the food, I forgot about these \"got gypped on their bills\" reviews, till I got MY bill.   I only ordered two items off the menu, my server's recommendation.  1.  The Bosnian sausage sandwich - $6.50 menu price.  2.  the chicken soup for $5.50 menu price.  I was charged $1 MORE for each item I ordered, plus $2.50 MORE for 3 items I did NOT order. I tried to show the server I was overcharged for all these items, but server did not speak enough English to correct my bill, customer had to translate. Then server said, \"We have new menu, changed prices, but new menu not received yet\". But Yelpers yelp they have been \"padding bills\" for years.  My server was a slim 50+ man with white crew cut, and accent.  On another visit, I found out he was THE OWNER'S HUSBAND!    Heads Up to those wanting to order the $6.50 Bosnian sausage sandwich that I did. I was served the sandwich with 2 \"condiments\" 1. crock of tomato-based sauce and 2. crock of sour cream, which I put in my sandwich. Later when I got my bill, the $6.50 Bosnian sausage sandwich was billed $7.50, and I was also charged 50 cents MORE for EACH of the condiments, which server showed me was priced in a different part of the menu as \"Extras\". I told him I never asked for the \"Extras\", didn't even know they existed. But they put those Extras on my plate when they served me the sandwich, so not seeing the \"other part\" of the menu, I did use those extras, for which I got charged.  You think that what is served on your plate, is included in the entree price, and if listed in extras, is if you wanted MORE than what was on your plate (another one), I think most people like YOU, would just pay what your bill says, and not stir the pot, especially when you are eating there with other people (too embarrassing to make a scene?). But ME, it never feels good to be 'tricked' or 'cheated\" no matter how small the amt is, or how cheap the food is even AFTER the padding.   I was also charged another $1.50 for basket of bread, but the bread was never brought to my table, ....ever.  Know that basket of bread does not come with your entree or group dinner, like it is served complimentarily in many other restaurants. Bread is listed in the Extras section of the menu, along with the crocks of sauces.  So eat any bread they bring to your table only if you want to pay for it later.   So total I was OVER- charged $5.00, or 40% more than my $12 menu total for the two items $6.50 sandwich and $5.50 soup.     Other Yelpers bills were even MORE convoluted than mine. Yes, all extras and prices were specified on the menu, so why did my server and owner not follow their own menu?   Ya know, NOW I am almost laughing that I ordered only 2 items off the menu, and I was up charged 5 different times for 5 different items, delivered to my table or not, bringing my supposed-to-be $12 bill to $17.00 before tax. How inept or flagrant can you get!   After 20 min of laborious arguing with him about those items he over charged me for, with a customer's help in translating, my server did take off a total of $5.00.  My Lunch bunch MeetUp had this restaurant already on their calendar for the following Thurs.  I posted my billing experience.  One guy cancelled because of my experience, but the others who went did not have the same over billing experience that I did, and they did not tell the restaurant about my experience before they got served.  They had a different server, a woman.  So 6 months after my first visit, on Oct 18, I decided to give them another chance.  My server was a blond woman.  I ordered the gyros sandwich but told her that I did not want the sauces and told her I was overcharged for 5 different items when I only ordered 2.  I could have not told her and see if they would do the same thing as my first time, but I didn't want to spend the long time it took to remove the charges.  She gave me good service, spoke fluent English, and  did not over charge and asked me 2 x if everything was OK, while I was eating.  But the taste was not good enough for me to return to try other things.  Their menu is very small, and she said it did not change for all the years they have been open - 30?  So I am giving 1 star for the first experience, 3 stars for the second, so 2 stars overall.",

Unfortunately, I'm currently woefully short on vacation days and cash so as soon as I got back from my most recent excursion to Ireland, I knew I would need something to hold me over until I can do another big trip.  The Phoenix metro area at first glance wouldn't necessarily seem like the type of big city to find a wide range of international cuisine, but several years of food exploration (thanks largely to Yelp) have changed my perspective.  I've discovered restaurants specializing in Peruvian, Salvadoran, Moroccan, Tunisian, Ecuadorian, Jamaican and other hard to find food spots.  So I've bookmarked and set out to try lots of different international cuisines.  Many I have no experience with or know nothing about.  Bosnian food?  I couldn't be more ignorant of it.  Sounds like the perfect learning opportunity.  Enter Old Town Sarajevo.  Located on the south side of Northern Ave just a few blocks east of 35th Ave, Old Town Sarajevo lies in an old strip center and is bookended by a tobacco shop and a small Asian market.  Run by Bosnian born owner Seida Turulja, the restaurant is as much an escape from the ordinary aesthetically as it is on their menu.  The interior is purposefully used to mimic an old school neighborhood cafe you might find in Sarajevo (the capital and largest city in Bosnia, FYI).  Its a mix of stone arches, brown tile floors, as well as a bevy of wooden accented furniture and wall trimmings.  You have to see it for yourself to appreciate how unique it is to the valley.  Now about that menu.  Truth be told I did do a little bit of research in advance to verify whether the dishes listed on their menu are truly authentic to Bosnia (they are) and which are the most popular and basic to Bosnian food culture.  Basically I was looking for Bosnian food 101 during my first trip here.  Fortunately, Sladjana my waitress immediately pointed out which dishes are popular with the locals, which are popular back in Bosnia, and how big the portions were.  I love sausage and bread, so the Cevapi was right up my alley.  I got the Cevapi Veliki more specifically (basically their midsize sausage dish).  I hesitate to call this a sandwich as its more of a stuffed bread dish where the sausages are stuffed and covered inside a thin layer of fresh made bread called Lepinja.  The dish comes with a side of sliced raw onions, sour cream, and an unusual veggie spread (the spread is made up of bell peppers, garlic and eggplant).  To wash it down I asked for a Bosnian beer.  They were unfortunately out of the one I inquired about, but Sladjana told me she'd get me a better one that wasn't on their menu (okay?).  It was a lager called Lav Pivo (I later discovered its a Serbian beer, but its popular in Bosnia).  For dessert I ordered a Tulumbe, a dish invented by the Ottomans and still beloved in the former Ottoman regions.  Total price for all the food, drink, tax and tip came to $22.  First the beer.  Lav Pivo is a smooth light lager, though I would hesitate to say that it stood out from any of the multitude of American or Canadian lagers I've had in my lifetime.  Still, a decent beer.  The Cevapi arrived at my table with the bread still piping hot.  They give you a fork and knife to try and cut through the bread and sausages but honestly this is one dish where you can put the utensils to the side.  The Lepinja was so thin and moist it was difficult to cut it with precision so I took to just tearing off pieces of bread and sausage with my fingers (which Sladjana says is totally normal by the way).  The Cevapi Veliki comes with 10 sausages inside, though the portion isn't as intimidating as you'd think.  The combo of the bread, sausage, sour cream, and veggie spread garners a huge thumbs up from me.  The spread especially adds a great savory element and the Lepinja is a great vehicle for soaking up the sauces and meat juices.  Lastly, the Tulumbe.  Think of a shorter, softer, more plump version of a churro without all the cinnamon and this is basically what you get.  Its a surprisingly light dish and is traditionally served cold so the dough can absorb the light coating of syrup and sugar on top.  Surprising dish, but a tasty one.  Not a bad first outing here.  The food was pretty solid all around and the prices are pretty hard to beat with about 90% of the menu items priced at less than $10.  Next time I'm here I'll probably bring someone to share in one of their soups (the Bosanski Lonac looked particularly intriguing).  A fun first time foodie adventure into international territory, but conveniently located close to home.  Hoping I can find even more unique international finds like this here in the valley before long.  Or at least long enough to hold me over until I'm jet setting overseas again.",

This was the second trip for me. The first time I had the Stuffed Cabbage. The second time the first item on the menu: a sausage sandwich with a side of sour cream a tomato sauce and chopped onion. Both were served hot and fresh from the oven. The bread is like nothing you have tatested before. I got to try some of their chicken sandwich. It was also so much better then you would ever expect a chicken sandwich to taste.  One thing they lack is a through explanation of what is on the menu. You can ask the waitress and she will explain, but you have to ask. It would be useful if they handed out cards that explained what each dish was.  With the few people that were in there Saturday afternoon at 12 PM I think you will miss this one if you delay.",

The guy taking our order which I'm assuming is the owner was rude and sarcastic. The Cevape were ok but the bread was so oily that it made it mushy. The Kajmak was straight up sour cream which is not what Kajmak is suppose to be. I was expecting cabbage salad (Kupus Salata). This guy brought out pickled cabbage and pickles from the jar. Most places you go to ajvar, onions, and kajmak are included with the Cevape well not this place you have to ask for it and it's an extra charge. When he came to give us our check you can tell from all the food we left that we were not satisfied he didn't care to ask how was it or is everything ok but gladly took our money. I will never go back there. I found a better place during my stay in AZ it's called Balkan Bakery save yourself and go there you won't be disappointed.",

It appears to be family owned and everyone is so super nice and welcoming. Waitress was able to explain any question we had about the food and she was very polite. Food came out in a timely manner and it was fresh and hot (made to order). Lepinja bread was hot and very fluffy. The sausage that came with it was so flavorful and was not salty as some sausages can be. With this order they bring you a side of sour cream, roasted red pepper sauce, and fresh chopped onions. Amazing combo of ingredients. It was my first time there and it won't be the last. I told them I would be back in tomorrow. All the food is reasonably priced. We were shocked that our bill was only $16 for two orders of the lepinja with sausage and one drink. I would have expected to pay more for such delicious food. Oh and before I forget, the drink I ordered was a Bosnian version of orange soda called Jupi. It was not as sweet at American orange soda and actually tasted as if it were fresh orange juice with soda water. Very light and refreshing. I am in LOVE with this place. Do not hesitate to give this place a try.",

Seriously, turn on the left turn blinker, check your blind spot, move into the left turn lane, and make a u turn. Like now. This is a place you don't want to miss.   Historically, strip malls are know for bargain priced knick knacks, off brand clothing, and mediocre greasy food. Old Town Sarajevo takes all of those preconceived notions and shatters them in one authentic Bosnian cultural experience.   Opening the front door you are greeted with the sweet sound of Bosnian music, quaint village decor, and the haunting aroma of fried bread. Think the brighter, more delicious, less pirate, Bosnian version of Pirates of the Caribbean.   Our fantastic server greeted us, gave us recommendations (the cevapi and the spinach pita), and we ordered. Little did we know that those would be some of the last words we would utter before our mouth eyes were opened to the beautiful world that is Bosnian cuisine.   Our food arrived and there before me was my cevapi, a mountain of glistening bread!!! Bread! Glorious BREAD!!! My heart was overjoyed with the appearance of this glorious dish, I picked up the fork and knife presented to us, and as I cut in to the dish, there, inside the bread was a heap of Bosnian sausage!!! Sausage! Glorious SAUSAGE!!!   Upon my first bite, my world was flipped upside down. Suddenly all of my maps were centered around southeastern Europe. Suddenly my words no longer worked, all I was capable of was continuing to eat, And eat. And eat.   There was ruckus in the restaurant (a drunk and disorderly patron bad mouthed the Bosnian culture and was immediately confronted by other patrons and escorted out by the restaurants owners) so our server treated us to dessert on the house. You guessed it: it was delicious.   I must admit, I am relatively ignorant to Bosnian culture, but one trip to Old Town Sarajevo and I am convinced that I have been missing out. Old Town Sarajevo, thank you.",

Parking outside is limited, you literally have to \"come at a right time\" to find decent parking. Size of the restaurant itself is not big, so if you are coming with a group of 6+, good luck.  And lastly, the service. Although, VERY friendly... also very slow. It took forever for us to get any kind of service once we were seated.

There was only 2 tables with people eating and another group of several persons were leaving.  The staff were inconsiderate and just kept standing and talking and taking photos with these people who were on their way out.   I wanted something that was not hot and spicy so I ordered the chicken sandwich.  Waitress asked me if I wanted mushrooms and cheese on it so I asked if the mushrooms were fresh.,  She said they were so I told her to put them on.  One bite into the sandwich and I knew they were not fresh mushrooms bur canned.  I sat there for some time waiting for someone to ask me how everything was but nobody ever checked back with me.  I got up and left.  As I was leaving I mentioned to the gal at the counter how disappointed I was and she acted like she didn't hear me and asked me if I was walking out without paying.  I told her I was not going to pay for something I could not eat and should have been told that the mushrooms were canned and not fresh Very disappointing food and waste of my time. The area this place is located in is not a very good area and I would advise people to not go after dark.",

    "text": "You walk into this place and you literally have stepped out of west Phoenix and into Bosnia. Cafe Sarajevo is THE place for the substantial Bosnian community in Phoenix (who knew there was one?) to hang out at, with Bosnian television constantly on the tv and old Bosnian men sitting at tables shootin' the shit while drinking strong Bosnian (aka Turkish) coffee.  I've been here a couple times for lunch and had the cevapi, a sandwich made with Bosnian sausage, soft  fluffy lepinja bread, diced onions, and a pepper spread.   Excellent food, paired with a jovial, friendly owner make for a great casual lunch experience. You don't find much of Bosnian anything anywhere in the States, so if you're ever around this neck of the woods, swing by and check it out. They also have a small market with Bosnian goods in the back.",

And the server was unable to explain the dishes. Luckily I had googled the restaurant ahead so I had some clue.   My bean soup was very good, and the pita was tasty, but light. The spinach cheese pita was nothing special. Hubby enjoyed his hefty sausage sandwich served on a pita and some delicious pea soup. He enjoyed the small cup of Turkish coffee, a mild expresso. Server/owner treated our group to sampler plates of delicious desserts including my favorite, baklava.  Our group enjoyed the experience. The menu is heavy food and not something I would eat often. For me more veggie dishes makes for a more balanced and healthier meal.  Just sayin...",

Cevapi, Kebab, Steak Sandwich, Burek, Sirnica and Zeljanica were all wonderful. First time trying Jupa and it's better than orange soda. My dad was the only one with room for a Tulumbe but did get it 'to go'.   The staff is very nice and helpful. I can't wait to go back.   Thank you for making my dad's Father's Day a huge success!",

When we walked through the door the aroma of freshly baked bread made us hungry.  The menu was one page, which I prefer because that meant the food was fresh and quickly prepared. They did not disappoint. I had the beef pita bread which came out as a spiral that filled the plate. Others chose the spinach pita while others enjoyed the soups, gyros and other great offerings. My bill came to $8 which included ice tea, a real bargain for authentic Bosnian food. Our waiter was helpful and friendly. I will come here again if I am nearby.",

Yesterday I tried the stuffed cabbage. They are normally out of it when I go there but they finally had some. It was incredible. The cabbage they use to wrap the meat mixture was soured much as you would sauerkraut. It was out of this world. This is a dish that would cause a single man to fall in love. I am going to have to get this recipe for my wife. Maybe share it with my single daughter to only be served with a young man that meets with her father's approval.  The prices are great. The Turkish coffee is fantastic. And the food is not to be missed. If you're looking for a unique dining experience you will want to give Cafe Sarajevo a try. You will not be sorry.",

    "text": "It seems as though good sausage is a way to my heart...or so my doctor tells me. But enough about me, this is all about a fantastic Phoenix gem that I would have never known of had it not popped up on my Yelp app one Sunday afternoon; this is about Caffe Sarajevo.  This Bosnian dive is home to a seemingly authentic menu, and an atmosphere that made me feel like I left Phoenix for lunch. As with any ethnic dive, I expected service to be absolute crap or absolute gold...the service I got was gold! I walked in with the girlfriend into a small dining area filled with customers speaking words that I couldn't understand while laughing and having a great time enjoying their food and company. We were immediately greeted and asked to sit wherever we'd like by a server who was smiling and very welcoming. After we sat down, he came over and was awesome enough to go over most of the menu with us, explaining each of his favorite things in perfect detail. - If you know me, you know I like dives... Also, if you know me, you know I love asking for recommendations, and love hearing those recommendations with enthusiasm. -  I was in heaven, and completely excited when we decided on the Cevapi (the sausage sandwich), the Pljeskavica (a beef patty sandwich), a Sirnica (cheese puff pastry) and some freshly made Turkish coffee...  And here we go:  I love coffee, especially strong, rich coffee with real flavor. Lemme tell ya, if you're looking for some good caffeinated mud, look no further. Just great. While waiting for the main dishes, we shared the Sirnica, which had just come out of the oven! It was literally a hot mess and filo doughLICIOUS! As far as those sammiches, we didn't want to stop mowing through them! The Cevapi was served with a couple sauces and raw onion, and the sausage was a mix of lamp and cow. Mix those all together on some freshly baked Bosnian bread, and...Yum! The Pljeskavica was a patty on the same bread, but had more of a lamb flavor to me than a beef. It was also yum, especially since it was covered in cheese and mushrooms!!  Holy hell, I've gone on long enough. The food was great. The service was great. The people were all great. I'm such a fan. I love dive restaurants. I love ethnic food, and now, I love Bosnian food.",

    "text": "There's no better way to have your first Bosnian cuisine than having a True-blooded Bosnian for company. He speaks the language, ordered for us, and knows if the food is authentic and not watered-down for the American palette.   WHY GO THERE?  My Bosnian friend gave this restaurant the thumbs-up seal of approval. The food is  good, he had a box to go for the next day.  WHATCHAGOT?  For starters, we ditched the hearty soup and went for bread. We had all three pitas: meat, cheese and spinach. While each was delicious and warmed up, it would have been better to have them early in the day when they're made fresh. Traditionally, you grab the end by hand and uncoil the bread, as you work your way to the center. Best shared.   The cevapi is filling. I find the large too much, I could have settled for a medium or small. I asked about the raw onions. My friend said it is a cure for everything. Have an ailment, eat the raw onion! I guess it's apples for Americans, onions for Bosnians!  We wrapped dinner with an addictively sweet and delicious tulumbe. Better than baklava!  YOU GOT SERVED. Service is quick and friendly, but in a take-your-time-when-you're-ready-to-order kind of way. I like it better than the methodical service of chain restaurants. Overall, the Turkish and Greek influences are very much present in Bosnian cuisine. If you like Turkish, you'd like Bosnian food. Geez, that sounds like the perfume ad of the 80's.",

Pass on the salad, but then, you're probably not here for the salad (; Very charming decor but the plaza is iffy. Fast and efficient service just don't expect a smile from server, though owner is extremely friendly and welcoming.",

    "text": "I had put this on my bookmarks quite some time ago and then forgot about it until Brian S did his review.  It worked out I could drive by it on the way back to the shop after making my morning deliveries.  I got there at 10:00 which turned out to be too early for the spinach pita so I got the medium Cevapi.  My meat didn't seem to have as much fat and gristle as Brian Described.  My first thought seeing red pepper sauce was hot, I'm not good with high heat, but this had a good taste and the onions were way hotter than the sauce.  The bread was fresh and chewy.  I like the overall blend of the different flavors.    I think I was sort of between the morning coffee drinkers and the lunch crowd as I was the only customer in the place, having passed a group at the door that was just leaving.  And except for when the waitress was speaking to me there was no English spoken.  The interior was clean and neat in contrast the the aging strip mall facade of the building.  The was Bosnian music playing one the DVD/CD player.  Overall a different and enjoyable lunch stop. 3.2",

    "text": "A newly discovered gem hiding in the crevice of Northwest Phoenix. I had no idea there was a Bosnian presence here! As many things in Phoenix, this restaurant buried in a strip mall. Judging by the outside, I thought it was going to look like a hole in the wall. But the interior is like an Eastern European slice of Disney's It's a Small World ride. There are cute little faux windows and doors like you'd see in a Swiss village. It's very classy looking. When I was there, they had real roses on the tables (but I think that was because of a private party coming in later). It feels like a family restaurant too with actual stocky Bosnian men coming in to chat and eat.  I had the Bosnian soup (chicken &  vegetable) which was like split pea soup. The real awesomeness is anything involving their bread. My friend and I split a ground beef patty sandwich, a spinach pita and a Bosnian sausage sandwich. The meat had amazing flavor. The pita was a flaky, buttery bread. The beef and sausage sandwich was made with a bread akin to ciabatta. Apparently the person who oversees the kitchen makes all the bread herself. The bread is really the crowning jewel. Our waitress was pretty nice though she kind of rushed us near the end because of the private party. She wasn't rude but it was a little off-putting. Still, I plan to come back here next time I've had a good exercise day and I feel I've earned my carbs.",

    "text": "We discovered this hidden gem after googling how to make Turkish coffee. The food prices were so low that we decided to try a little something from each part of the menu and we were pleasantly surprised at the authenticity and quality of the food that they offer. Though they aren't tucked away in the best area it is worth the 20 mile drive to experience this foreign delight. We enjoy the design of the inside and the ethnic music that they play (if/when they decide to play it). What holds me back from the fifth star is this lady that \"serves\" us the past few times we've been in. She's not rude by any means she's just not very attentive ex: not seating us, not bringing some of the items i've ordered, long wait times, not bringing the check, cold/watered down coffee, not playing music etc. Call me picky but there's a reason I kept coming back to this amazing restaurant, but as of late I've hesitated due to her. Will update with each visit because I want to leave 5/5!",

This is the first time I've eaten at a  Bosnian restaurant so I have nothing to compare it to, but I do know what i like to eat.  I've been here several times and I can't say enough about how good their home made bread is. It comes out warm and soft and it's like nothing I've had elsewhere. We always order the Cevapi, the Bosnian Sausage Sandwich which I think comes with flavorful roasted red pepper sauce . Their service is also very good.",

I've started to take large groups of friends and I order for the group so everybody can experience all the wonderful food and expose them the to Bosnian culture. I've brought at least 100 people there and everybody always loves it!  Beware!!!!!! Don't buy a bottle of wine while you are there!

Finally our food was served and oh man, the chicken was dry and mushrooms are out of a can, very greasy bread. Their signature sausage is tasty funny as well tbh Costco's 1.5 $ hotdog tastes better.

Old Town Sarajevo was a great find, for starters don't be put off by the location, parking lot or exterior as once you enter you will be pleasantly surprised by the decor.  We had the cabbage roll which was very tasty and could have eaten more, we also ordered the spinach pita another hit and ended with Civapi which is a Bosnian sausage delivered tucked into a large split roll and either baked or fried was not quite sure, you can order the sausage in orders of 5, 10 or 15.  With all the other food I had ordered 10 sausage which was too much but still tasty.  The beer selection not great but our lager from Montenegro was very good.  Old Town Sarajevo has been in business for eighteen years which is a testament to the great food they put out.  Our server was very friendly and prompt.  We will definitely visit next time we are in town.",

We are currently taking a Bosnian language class in Tempe and wanted to stop by before we head over to Bosnia for the final portion of our program. It's a bit off the beaten track for us but entirely worth it! We really enjoyed the food (the sarma was my favorite!) and the hospitality. The interior of the restaurant is cute as well. I'm sad to only be in Phoenix for the summer -- I would visit often if I lived here!",

From the outside you wouldn't think they would be good, the parking lot is falling apart. Once inside the restaurant is larger than you'd assume. We split the steak, cheese & mushroom-it was huge!

Like stepping into a little European village. The owner spared no expense creating a complimentary atmosphere.   6 different Yugoslavian beers - big ones! We got the Skopsko lager, it was delicious! We tried the Bosnian beef stew - so flavorful! Beef & veggies were so tender. The spinach & cheese \"pita\" was more of a savory stuffed croissant. It was worth trying. The sausage was served in a soft bread, spongy on the inside to soak up the juices but lightly crispy on the outside, proving it was freshly baked. It was served with a yummy veggie spread, sour cream and raw onions, all on the side so you can make your own perfect bite!   Try it out, it's worth it!  Friendly warm staff.",

    "text": "I just drove 23 miles just to try this little ethnic restaurant and  thought it was well worth it!  Caffe Sarajevo sits in an unassuming building off of Northern and 35th avenue. I had read about their Cevapi which is a traditional Bosnian sausage sandwich and I thought it was very good.  Only one table was occupied upon entering the restaurant at approximately one p.m. I asked the waitress for her recommendation just to be sure and I also did not want to screw up. I kinda had my eyes on the kebab but decided to along the recommendation for the Cevapi sandwich.  It took about 10 minutes for the food to be delivered, which I thought was a little long but I was not in a rush or anything. I happened to pick a wobbly table of course...  Despite the wait, the food was delicious and  I was particularly fond of the bread which was soft and chewy. I ordered the small version of the Cevapi which comes with five sausages and happened to be plenty of food.The sandwich also comes with  red pepper spread and sour cream which cost about $ 1.50 each extra, so the total cost of the sandwich with these two side items came to $ 8.74 with just drinking water. For the quality of the food, I thought it was inexpensive.  I thought the waitress was very welcoming and a  sweetheart who checked on me on several occasions to make sure  I was happy and content with my meal and I sure was.I was so full after eating the small Cevapi that  I did not have any room for dessert. I had discovered Caffe Sarajevo after reading about it in the ratings for \"10 best sandwiches in the valley.\"",

Server did not come to our table as quickly as I would have liked although it was not very busy there. I had a green salad (nothing special, just lettuce and tomatoes with a vinaigrette type dressing) and the Bosnian Sausage (w/o bread), my friend had the spicy Beef Sausage with the bread which he said was tasty. Both our sausages were very good although I think I preferred my friend's spicy sausage. The service was fair and I say that because she brought out my dish, served another table their food and then finally brought out my friend's dish a few minutes later. Then she didn't really check on us while we were eating. She did bring my friend some more iced tea but she didn't ask us how the food was. Only after we saw another table go up to the cashier counter did we realize we were supposed to pay there instead of waiting for the server to bring us our bill. All in all the food was very good and I would probably go back.",

We went in and waited and waited and waited...We were not given a seat until some time and that was after we were rudely asked if we had a reservation. We did not have one we always wanted to try this place and figured now would be a good time to pop in and have my sis try different food since she rarely agrees to do so. We were sat in the booth right next to the door which is super dark.  We waited 10 minutes we were not even offered any water or anything. So we waited longer and another couple came in and they were asked the same thing and got told to sit anywhere of course there's only two of them but they take a big table which we could have taken which was in the actual restaurant not a dark corner. There was birthday group there also of 5 or six people and they had started the gifts already so we assumed their orders were already taken must to our dismay they were not. She went to them to take their orders.   After waiting 20 minutes and nothing happening we agreed to go down the road to get pizza before we all starve to death. Not a good experience maybe a bad night for them? But between being put in the dark closet and waiting forever this place was what nightmares are made of. Nightmares of hungry people and no food....",

Anything with phyllo is special because it's so delicate, the stuffed cabbage uses shredded beef instead of ground beef; the sausages are juicy, fatty, and crispy, and the flat bread is really wonderful.  The menu is short and everything will be good.  Wine is weird: white served warm and red was cold, and they're both mediocre, but worth trying once since it's from little known regions.",

The waitress is very polite, she seems excited to see someone coming into the place, and she's been this way all 4 times that I have gone here.  Now to the food. Our first visit here I had the Cevapi. The sausages are really juicy, tender, and delicious. But the bread...the BREAD! It's soft, slightly chewy, airy, but not dry. The bread alone is worth coming back for. Friends of ours had ordered the Pita filled with cheese, and black bean soup. The soup was very well balanced, and really flavorful. The pita is a must have. I've had the meat filled Pita, but for myself I prefer the cheese filled pita.  If you come here, and you like coffee, you have to get the turkish coffee, it's $0.99, you don't get a lot of it mind you, but what you do get is very strong, smooth, and good to boot.  The last time I went here, there were 5 of us, and we ordered the Meat Platter. It's not on the menu, and it's expensive, but you get TONS of meat. The tray of meat comes with 4 nice size pieces of their amazing bread as well. Needless to say, the tray for 4 fed all 5 of us, plus 2 friends who ate the leftovers at my place later that night. So buyers beware, it's really a ton of meat. On it came chicken, steak, 4 different sausages, and 2 different meat patties.   By far, my favorite sausage was the veal sausage. It looks like a kielbasa, but it is nothing like it. They sear the veal sausage so its casing has a bit of a crunch, it's sweet, and very, very flavorful. One of my favorite sausages.  All in all, you get really good customer service, a lot of food at a CHEAP price, cool atmosphere. Can't go wrong with Cafe Sarajevo. I have recommended, and will continue to recommend Cafe Sarajevo to my friends.",

I didn't really care for it. It says at their web site and on their menu...'Turkish Coffee' 1.00.  I had 2 cups, my friend had 1 cup. That is 3.00 plus tax. He never brought us a ticket, so we figured ok, we'll just go up and pay. I handed him 5.00 and he said, \"6.00.\" I thought he didn't know what I handed him was a 5 so told him because I didn't hear him say 6.00. he was waiting for me to give him the other dollar. I told him I thought they were 1.00 each. I said we only had 3. He shook his head. So i didn't know what he was talking about...I was just flustered. I asked my friend if  she had a dollar... and he just waved us off and put the 5 in and I could tell he was mad. So, make sure you get a ticket!

I prefer to add some spice thought it was a little bland.  The spinach pita reminded me of Greek spanakopita but with less flavor because no feta. I had to order the cheese pita to go because it was not ready when I arrived.  The place is super cute and comfortable inside. Does transport you to a European village. I would return just to support these guys. Not enough places like this in Phoenix.  My advice to the owners, raise your prices and get another server. I was the only one when I arrived but soon after 4 other families arrived and still just one lady serving.  I had the sausage sandwich, soda, spinach pita and then ordered to go bread, cheese pita and whole bill was $18. How will they stay in business with pricing like that on a brick and mortar place.  Anywho good place and good food. Support these guys and try it. If you like spicey food bring hot sauce.",

Sausage are fun and juicy! Bread is to crave for! Homemade airy buttery bread!! If you like croissant, this bread may hit you home run!   Cabbage is a bit salty for our taste so wasn't much of a fan. But we both really like the sausage dish!   Staffs are very kind :)",

The place is very nicely decorated with mementos from Bosnia, the server and even the customers were very nice and the food exceeded our expectations.  All of our choices were met with praise.   I would have added another star except there was a bit too much salt on the cabbage rolls and the apple strudel would have been much better served warm.  We will definitely be going back to Old Town Sarajevo. They also need to change their website because they are actually closed on Tuesday which was the date we were planning to eat there.  Only after I called on Monday to make reservations did I learn that they are not open on Tuesdays.",

    "text": "Visit beautiful Phoenix, Arizona!  Here you will enjoy the warmth of the desert, the scenery of the mountains, the eclectic population, and the fantastic... Bosnian/Herzegovinian cuisine?  Am I reading that right??  Yes.  Yes you are.  This was an incredible little jewel to find nestled in the suburbs of Phoenix.  Trust me, though, it is well worth it.  It sits in a strip mall very quietly and almost hidden.  There is no fanfare or gimmick, it's just a cafe serving up some eastern incredible food.  After reading other recommendations, I tried the cabbage rolls, which was served in a broth.  It's listed under the soup menu, in fact.  These... were... incredible.  The rolls themselves were delicious, and the flavors and textures were spot on, but the broth stole the show!  It was savory beyond reason, and it really warms the soul.  Ask for a spoon, trust me on this.  I had the sausage (small) for an entree, though I think it was designed as an app.  Whatever, I ate it, and it was also incredible.  The bread was some combination of bread and cheese, so it had a wonderful texture to it.  The sides of diced onion, sour cream, and a roasted red pepper mix were all complimentary in the best ways.  I only wish I had a larger stomach and could try everything.  The food was incredible, and the service was great.  My server stopped by frequently to clear plates and check that everything was okay.  You're not going to find real silver utensils or cloth napkins here, but you know what?  I'm more than okay with that.  The price is very reasonable, and if it helps to keep costs down, then do what you gotta do, so long as the food stays this good.    If I'm ever in Phoenix again, you can believe I'm stopping on by!  This was an amazing find, and I'm so grateful to you Yelpers for pointing it out!",

Also for those that are complaining about the smell, how rude and inappropriate of you. That's as if saying someone's culture smells. Now, this place is legit. It takes like you are being transported into Bosnia and eating in a restaurant there. It is delicious & simple. Do not come here if a little butter and grease will disappoint you. The cevapi are a Bosnian staple and I highly recommend them. They look like breakfast sausages but they are a dinner food. Dip them in the condiments and eat them with the bread. They are tasty!",

    "text": "My Romanian heritage requires me to consume stuffed cabbage several times a year. Given my current life with a broken leg, I can't just hop a plane to my mother's kitchen across the country.   Lucky for me, the Bosnian owners of Old Town Sarajevo have proper cabbage on the stove every day. And it's good.  Though the former Yugoslavia has undergone a number of rough years, someone passed on a granny style recipe that's just slightly sour and soupy. The last time I ate there, a $5 order got me three beef stuffed rolls in clear broth, oniony and brimming with flavor I haven't had in ages.   This is not your Jewish deli style stuffed cabbage. That's often sweet and even tomato sauced, though it is beef. Muslims and Jews follow similar dietary laws and do not eat pork.  At Old Town Sarajevo, that's fine with me.   My mother's stuffed cabbage has beef, pork and ham, not to mention a well washed and drained sauerkraut that gives it a German touch.   With my three huge rolls, I added bread which was earthy and fresh, reminding me of pita or lavash. That was well worth the extra dollar.   The menu includes a number of soups, sausages and other simple fare for hungry workers. Portions are large. Large as in share with someone. You can always order more.   If you like dark coffee, the Turkish brew is pitch black and smoky, authenticity prepared and served in glass. I do not indulge in such decadence, but I rather enjoyed inhaling my friends' drinks.   The owners treated our group to iced tea and soft drinks and were extremely gracious. No alcohol is available, but if you wrap your order to go it would be delightful at home with a glass of wine or beer.",

The decor was spot on 5/5, the food was 4/5 depending on what you got. The service and attitude of the owner, however, was 1/5.  One of our friends that we were with had a hard time on deciding what she wanted. His response to this was \"Let's go, madam, I don't have all day.\" Even though there was only one other couple there. The second was when I wasn't finished eating and I literally had the fork in my mouth while he took the dish away, like really what normal person does that, we were all just lost for words. Lastly, when I asked for dessert he responded by saying \"You don't need any more sugar\" Lol... this guy is quite the character and suggest you go there only if you want to experience the unique Balkin asshole experience.",

You would had never believed from the outside.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  Her advice was top notch.  When my former coworker ordered the steak sandwich (one of their more expensive items) she jumped in and told her, \"listen biatch!

And she was very much right, and we all agreed and we all ordered some of their finest.    The food here is very bread and meat heavy.  I ordered their stuff cabbage, absolutely delicious!!  My subordinate ordered the cheese pita, which was quite amazing, and my former coworker, she ordered a spinach pita, some Bosnian Sausages and a imported beer.  Not bad at all.  She loved the beer.

When we asked the server for water he brought us a Kirkland water bottle and charged a $1.50. My father also asked for the most popular beer on tap, he was brought bottled beer. There were also no glasses available to pour our beverages in, you could only drink straight from the bottles. Other than that i would definitely recommend this place for a cultural experience, the food is definitely a great representation of Eastern European cuisine.",

I loved the little touches they put into the decor to make you feel like you were eating like a local in Bosnia.  The menu focuses on a lot of meat and starchy items, very hearty, stick-to-your-ribs type of food. I asked our server what he would recommend if we were dining here for the first time and he suggested the cevapi/Bosnian sausages and cabbage rolls. We decided to get one of each, and I got an additional side of Bosnian bread (Lepinja).   Our orders looked delicious when they came out, especially the lepinja. It was my favorite part of the meal. It was a soft, pillowy flat bread that had a lightly crisp outer coating. It was kind of like Indian naan but on steroids. Delicious, doughy steroids. Oh it was so good I could eat a ton of it just by itself! I told our server I loved the bread and he proudly replied that it has won a lot of awards and people will come to the restaurant just to buy a bunch of it. I totally believe that!  The cabbage rolls came three to an order, and had a small dollop of sour cream on top. The ground meat filling was tender, well seasoned, and the cabbage leaves were rolled nicely around it. I wasn't a fan of the sauce though, which was too acidic tasting for my tastes. I loved the cevapi sausages. They had a lovely grilled flavor and were very juicy and plentiful in the lepinja bread they were encased in.  Overall it was a lovely experience and if I'm in the area you bet I'll be back for those delicious little sausages and Bosnian bread!  4.25/5",

    "text": "Wow! What a treasure this place is! I just finished my meal and I'm already looking forward to going back.   First off, all of the praise for the bread in other reviews is complete truth. I would probably be content just going there for it alone it's so delicious.  We started off with the beef soup and the cabbage rolls. Both were dynamite; the soup was super hearty and more of a stew with healthy-sized pieces of beef, carrots, cabbage, etc.   The next item ordered was the beef patty sandwich. Saying that it was amazing would be an understatement. The patty was perfectly seasoned, it was served on the highly addictive bread mentioned previously, and the melted cheese kept all of the mushrooms locked in place. I'm normally not a fan of mushrooms, but these complemented the sandwich perfectly.   The owner hooked up samples of all three deserts since it was our first visit. While all three were very good, I'll always be partial to baklava, and theirs did not disappoint.   The decor makes you feel like you're in another country and everything looked to be in top order. I'm so glad that we tried this place and I will eagerly anticipate my next visit. And the next. And the next. And the next.",

I went with my teenage son and boyfriend. My son is a pretty picky eater and we were surprised that he loved his Cevapi. I would order this next time, I ordered some spinach pastry-type dish. We finished our meal off with turkish coffee (our show recommended trying this). We did enjoy this as well. One thing I will mention is that the prices on the menu seemed to be different on our actual tab (the tab was higher), but the server was very helpful and friendly so we didn't really complain. When we asked about the desserts she actually let us try a complimentary sampler which was also a little bonus. Overall it was a very good experience especially since my son liked it. We would definitely like to come back and would recommend it to friends.",

We were greeted by a friendly waiter and quickly were offered any table to sit at. Finding the perfect table quickly and then sitting to examine the menu.   We were told that the \"Bosnian Sausage\" was the best thing to try for a newbie to the Bosnian taste. We quickly ordered one non spicy and one spicy sausage and it came on fresh bread and some sauces on the side.Writing this my mouth is watering again.   Anyway  delicious and we decided to get the \"Turkish Coffee\" at the end of our meal as well as a selection of dessert. Our waiter knowing this was our first time to the resturant wanted to make our experiance that much better and gave us the desserts on the house. All I can say for this place is if you want to venture out and try something new get down there and get some goodness.",

    "text": "If you look in a dictionary for Hole in the Wall restaurant the example will say see Caffe Sarajevo. From the outside you would drive right by it, which we did, and when you pull up in front of the place you would wonder how good can this be. Also you will wonder if your car and/or stereo will be there when you get back. Yes the neighborhood is a little scary and the strip mall this place is located in is a little run down. Then you walk in the front door after you tell yourself hey we are here we are going in no matter what. Once you enter you feel like you just stepped through the wardrobe or something. Very nice and clean inside. The decor is excellent. Lots of fake doors and house facades around the either inside. Also some trinkets on the walls but not a lot like some wanna be sports bar. We are here for the first UYE International Supper Club. This turned out to be a great way to kick this off. I have never had Bosnian food before so I didn't even know what to order. Couldn't even pronounce half the things on the menu. Luckily there are also basic English translations on the menu as well. I couldn't quite decide what to get and neither could one of my fellow dinners so we decided to split the Bosnian Sausage Sandwich and the Beef Patty Sandwich, which we added cheese and mushrooms too. The prices are great. Very inexpensive. So far so good. Then the food starts arriving. Someone orders some stew and that smelled and looked good. Then my food arrived. Looked good. Can't wait to try it. My fellow dinner and I each cut the sandwiches in half and traded halves. Upon first inspection the Beef Patty Sandwich looked like ooey gooey goodness but the sausages in the Bosnian Sausage Sandwich looked like store bought heat and serve sausages. What was going on here. But the first bite obilderated that thought. These were so far away from heat and serve sausages it wasn't even funny. One of my favorite sayings is It is so good you punch a hole in the wall. Well this was so good you would tear the whole wall down. I can imagine having these sausages on a breakfast plate. They would be great anywhere. Of course the Beef Patty Sandwich was as advertised. Ooey gooey goodness. They should make a combo plate of half of each sandwich and put it on the menu. So good. Every bite more delicious then the last. I was sorry to finish them. I wanted more.  Then of course I had to get some Baklava for dessert. For $2 how can you say no. This continued the delicious train. Some of the best I have had. This place made my list of new favorite places. The service was great. Food was awesome. Small little hole in the wall mom and pop place. Total surprise. I will definitely be back. I think my fellow dinners liked it as much as I did. There were clean plates and smiles all around. Thank you to Ursula D. and Monica O. for setting this up. It was a great idea and a good find. Can't wait for the next UYE International Supper Club. Can't wait to come back here again.",

    "text": "First key to Caffe Sarajevo - don't miss this place.  It's located in a very non-descript strip mall with limited seating.  Google Map Street View this place before coming!  Second key to Caffe Sarajevo - the interior decor is adorable.  I'm not someone who uses the adjective 'adorable' often, but I can't think of another word that fits.  It's like what Disney would do if they wanted to design a restaurant for Bosnialand.  Third key to Caffe Sarajevo - and the most important - the food!  And it's delicious!  The Cevapi seems to be the signature dish - a sandwich of delicious little ground meat sausages filled in a lepinja bread that has kind of a ciabatta-like texture to it.  However, instead of the crisp crust of ciabatta, it's more chewy.  The bread also has a bit more bite.  I've tried the small (with 5 sausages) and it's a bit light.  I'd recommend at least the medium (with 10 sausages).  The sandwich is served with a side of chopped red and white onions and a serving of a smooth tomato sauce, served cold  with a bit of heat.  They also offer a few different types of Bosnian pitas - which are actually a filled phyllo dough pastry that is baked into a round.  The zeljanica is crispy, flakey, chewy, gooey, filled with a cheesy spinach.  Very heavy but also very addictive.  As a baklava fanatic, I had to give their baklava a try.  No pistachios, walnuts make up the main nut component.  Also, it's less sweet and there's a definite savory element to it.  It's also not completely drenched and the honey they use is on the thinner side.  There are fewer phyllo dough layers so it's less crunchy.  It's good, but I'm not sure if I'm a fan of this style of baklava.  Gotta try them next time!  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Prices were very reasonable for the volume of food.  The menu is pretty limited, but what they do make is all delicious.  Plus, for Bosnian cuisine, which I'm guessing most people in the United States aren't very familiar with, it makes choosing what to get much simpler.",

Simply delicious from all points of view.  They make their own sausages and their own bread from scratch.  In fact they make everything from scratch right there in the restaurant.  Their soups are do die for. A very favorite of ours. I give this a 5 star because in the Bosnian/Jugoslavian cuisine catagory, this can't be beaten. One more thing worth mentioning:  her Baklava is top of the mark.  It's not as sweet as what you find in other restaurants.   Everything is simply top shelf.",

The Bosnian sausage sandwich is simple and hearty, with sour cream and a roasted bell pepper relish to compliment the flavors. The breads are all baked in-house, as is the baklava.  A word about the baklava. I am a serious baklava fan. I love to try the seemingly endless versions of this dessert. The baklava at Cafe Sarajevo is much more nuts than phyllo dough, and not over-sweet at all. I think it's my current favorite.  Another thing Cafe Sarajevo gets right is the Turkish coffee. I love a cafe that brings me the ibrik with my coffee still in it, and leaves it for me to pour myself the second cup.  The bottom line is this place has great food for a very reasonable price.

We got a sampling of stuff to try as neither of us have tried Bosnian cuisine before. We split a chicken soup (amazing)!, cabbage with rice and ground meat (excellent flavor and sauce), a salad (of pickles, pickled green tomato, carrot, and pepper stuffed with slaw), and each got a sandwich (I got the chicken and my friend got the sausage.) The bread is really amazing, and almost the consistency of a popover. Everything was very tasty and I will have two meals off the leftovers! It all came to $30 which was a steal. The server forgot to give us silverware and we had to ask.. she was hilarious about it, and brought us each a dessert to enjoy as a thank you/sorry.  (I am not sure which it was, but very like gulab jamon in Indian restaurants.. cooked soft dough soaked in honey water-- yum!) I will definitely go back and thought it was a great value.",

Really cool. Wait staff are nice. Very direct ( just the facts type) but nice. The bread is to die for! I highly recommend the cevapi. Amazing sausage and get the sour cream and veggie spread. You'll love it! Never seen the place busy either. Been there many times. Every time, it's spot on! The only detractor is the parking. It's in a shitty little strip of stores with not enough parking right along side the road. It is super divey looking from the outside but, so much worth it!!",

    "text": "I decided to come here based on the reviews but was disappointed overall.  Food: We ordered the mali cevapi and the meat pita. These were really good and earns this restaurant the above stars; kudos to the lady chef in the back!   Unfortunately, the food was the only good thing about the place. See below for rest:  Experience: Minus 3 stars  1) When I came in, the guy who looked like the owner pretty much ignored us and tended to an existing guest instead. Most sit down places I've been to treat you like a priority by inviting you for a seat and giving a menu but this place did not. The restaurant was also nearly empty with only 2 tables filled so it wasn't because he was busy.  2) We asked for water and received Kirkland bottled water. I thought this was just the way this restaurant does things but a guest that came after us ordered water and got a glass of water instead. I feel that this was a money grab to charge us 2$ a bottle. This was greedy.   3) Another reviewer complained about, the menu prices suddenly change when you pay. The receipt I received was higher than what was on the menu.   4) After paying in cash, the owner rounded up the change he owed me and shorted me instead. i.e. If the bill was 25.18$ and I paid 30$, he gave me back 4$.. Again, here's the greed.   TL;DR: food is good, poor service, greedy owner (check your receipts and ask for glass of water)",

Since this was our first time eating Bosnian food, we had to ask for a recommendation. We both settled on the beef and lamb sausage, and it was delicious!

    "text": "I came here last week for the international supper club. Unlike my fellow Yelpers, I did not have time to investigate the menu online beforehand so I was not really sure what to order. Apparently their specialty is their sausages, which everyone at the table agreed were quite good, but my husband and I stuck with some safe choices. I got the stuffed cabbage and he ordered the steak sandwich. My mother's side of the family is Polish and growing up she would make stuffed cabbage regularly so it is something I really enjoy eating. These were a little smaller than hers but they serve you three of them so it was a very filling meal. They were cooked well, pretty much the same as my moms but less rice in the filling and the spices were a little different. I liked that they came with a good amount of tomato broth (some restaurants serve them with a thick gravy like sauce that I think is gross) and I really enjoyed sopping the juices up with the toasted pita-ish Bosnian flat bread that they served with it. The hubby also enjoyed his sandwich - you can never go wrong with steak in his book. This was a pretty big piece of meat that he got and it was real steak, not minced meat - it even had a big bone in it! We ended the meal with Turkish coffee and baklava. The coffee was very good. It was really strong but very smooth and even though it was unfiltered all the sediment magically settled to the bottom so it was not grainy at all. I am not sure if you are supposed to drink the pasty part at the bottom of the cup but I did not. The baklava was pretty similar to what I have had at Greek restaurants but perhaps a little less sticky sweet so personally I preferred this version to most others I have tried even though it is not one of my favorite deserts.  The best part about Caffe Sarajevo was the place itself. Even though it does not look appealing from the outside it has a totally charming interior. And staff. Our waiter was very friendly, helpful and courteous. We had excellent service. But even though the food and service were good I might not give it more than 3 stars if it weren't for the price. This place is just a really amazing value! My entree was only $5 and I think our total bill including drinks and dessert was less than $20 for the two of us. Overall, if it wasn't so incredibly far from where I live and in a part of town I never go to I would be back for sure.",

I'm no linguist. But he clearly sounded disgusted with me) I would ask him what he recommended and he would just say 'yeah'. So ordered I did. Seriously the food was incredible.

But when I read some reviews and saw the pictures of tasty looking food on Yelp, My husband and I gave a try and we fell in love with their food. It was the love at first 'taste'.  We do not eat beef and many of the items on the menu have beef. So things we can eat there are very limited. We normally order a soup and chicken sandwiches but still we love this restaurant a lot.   What we love the most about this place is their Bosnian bread. We tried the plain one (with no stuffing) and the one with spinach called Zeljanica. On their menu, it's translated as 'pita' but it's totally different from pita. It's still a kind of flat bread but much more fluffy and not so flat. This bread is very unique and super delicious. They use this bread for sandwiches too. We normally order some extra bread and bring back home to enjoy later. I've been trying to find how to make this bread but so far no luck.  Their desserts are also very delicious. You should try tulumbe which is like big churro in syrup. It's only $1.5 each. Their baklava is also nice and different from baklava you can get from a middle eastern store.  I do not know much about Bosnian food but I assume their food is authentic as they always have lots of guests who are talking in the language I totally do not understand.   This place does not look formal and everything on the menu is reasonably priced but has nice decor and quiet & cozy ambiance. Service is also excellent and people working there are all friendly.   I strongly recommend this restaurant.",

According to my friend, this is the only place she's been that they taste authentic. The bread that comes with it is baked daily.   The service was good as well. The owner was my server. The ambiance was pretty nice as well. On top of it all, the place is cheap. The large portion of the sausages was $7. Meal before tip was $8 and change and I got two meals out of it. I will definitely be returning.",

It's not in the best part of town and it's in one of the shadiest looking little strip malls but the inside is put together well (if a touch eccentric) and it was very clean. It was sort if like walking into the closet and coming out in Narnia, if that makes sense.  I must confess to knowing nothing about Bosnian food and the menu was vague, to say the least, so we went off of our waitress's recommendation.  The Cevapi (sp?) sandwich was actually delicious. The bread was phenomenal and the sausage was seasoned well and full of flavour. I do think it missed maybe some tomatoes and lettuce inside to provide some crunch and a bit of a contrast. I can only assume that that's not traditional in Bosnia and maybe just what I'm more accustomed too.  The service was fine. Our waitress was as helpful as she could be, despite the language barrier, but we made it work. The place was pretty empty but she didn't hover, which I really appreciated.  If your in the area and looking for a quick, cheap bite that's a little but different I would definitely recommend this place.  I'll be returning for sure.",

    "text": "This place is like getting in a time machine and going back in history. Somebody has spent a great amount of energy decorating the inside of this place like an old fashion Bosnian town. Tons of intricate wood work and detail to add just that right amount of fun and authenticity.  Came here after seeing the International Supper Club pig out at one of their UYE parties. They always pick great places and food that is unique and tasty. I can confirm all of the above with a smile.  The menu here is rather small but filled with several different types of Bossian specialties. Usually get one of the Cevapi/Bosnian Sausage Sandwiches. There are three different sizes depending on how hungry you at the moment. Also have tried the tasty Pljeskavica/Beef Patty with mushrooms and cheese.  Service is friendly and helpful. On my first visit the owner and server were getting ready to eat lunch. They were more than happy to share some of the treats that they were having with me. She said it was a potato version of the cheese pita that they make. Nice!  You know it is good when you can hear people speaking a language that you are not accustom to hearing. Sometimes they can get a little loud and passionate in their discussions. Gives you that intimate feeling like you are there with them and in the zone.   Overall the food is very good and worth checking out. There are several other dishes that I want to try on my next visit. Still need to also check out the desserts. Good thing my job has me in the area a couple times a month. Meet me for lunch if you can. CHEERS!  4.25 STARS",

Simple menu with the names of the food in Bosnian and English. Photos help too. We decided to start with something familiar, a meat pita and a spinach pita and a side of the bread (can't remember the name) with a veggie spread. I also ordered Turkish coffee which was a nice demitasse with sugar cubes and half-n-half. It was correct in every way, very strong and rich. We were expecting round halves of pocket pitas with the filling. This was nothing like that. The dough was more like a croissant. It looked as if the filler was rolled into a tube then spiraled and baked. It was excellent! The meat was fine ground beef and the spinach was in a cheese sauce (it seemed) the bread, zeljanica, was also flaky and the veggie spread was a good compliment to the bread. I brought zeljanica and veggie spread home for later. The price for 2-people, 1-coffee and lemon water was $15+!!! There are sauages on the menu and most of the diners were Bosnian. I only gave 4-stars because I haven't tried anything else- yet! I highly recommend giving Old Town Sarajevo a try, I think you will enjoy it as did I!",

    "text": "I've had this Bosnian restaurant bookmarked for some time and finally my friend and I were able to stop by for dinner. Located in a tiny strip mall, the decor was neatly arranged with cultural artifacts, white table clothes, and the atmosphere was spacious and cozy.   The menu was smaller and more affordable than my visit to Saraj. We decided to start off with a Home Style Bean Soup ($5) filled with light tasting Bosnian beans and chunks of beef here and there. Very hearty as the bowl warmed the belly. The beans boast wonderful flavor with hints of beef to render depth. The owner was very generous to give us a second serving so there was plenty to share.    Next, the Stuffed Cabbage ($5) arrived with boiled cabbage stuffed with ground beef that came with onions, peppers, and other seasonings with a dollop of sour cream on top. The cabbage was soft, naturally sweet, and easy to bite into. The ground beef had some pop due to the seasonings with a nicely broth to bring to a finer note. They were much bigger than the ones at Saraj as there were plenty of ground beef to fill the center. So delicious, it's something I'm eager to have again.  Their highly recommended item, the Bosnian Sausage Sandwich ($7), came with 10 pieces of small Bosnian sausages sandwiched held in-between two thick fluffy fried breads. The bread was slightly browned and crispy on the outside and spongy on the inside. The sausages were savory delicious and wonderfully seasoned. The sandwich also came with creamy red pepper sauce and raw onions to ignite sweet and sharp contrasts.  The extra fried bread for the bean soup was superfluous. Service-wise, the server was Bosnian but not particularly knowledgeable about the cuisine. The owner, however, was very warm, friendly, and managed to come out of the kitchen to greet us and address questions. Interested diners should know that they also have authentic Bosnian items that are not listed on the menu.   4.5 stars. Cheaper, bigger, and better than Saraj. This is one of the most overlooked places in the Valley. I would love to come back to try their veal and assortment of desserts.",

    "text": "My boyfriend had this restaurant bookmarked for a very long time. So long it was almost forgotten. Today, however was the day we decided to give it a try. I'm so happy we did.   First off I never would have known about this place if it were not for yelp. It's in a small older strip mall with about four businesses.   We walked in and and it was a little dark, mostly using natural light from the windows. We were advised to sit anywhere we liked. We chose a booth by the window so that we could better see and appreciate the decor. The place is clean and adorable.   We ordered two sodas and my bf asked our server what his favorite soup was and told him it was our first visit. He suggested the Earl, which came with bread. I ordered the steak sandwich.   The few other tables emptied as we eagerly awaited our food. Our server dropped off a plate with napkins and a fork and knife. This confused me a little since we ordered a soup and sandwich.   A few minutes later the soup is delivered with a basket of their wonderful bread and then a plate with a sandwich on it the size of my head is set before me. My sandwich consisted of an ENTIRE flattened steak covered in Melted cheese and mushrooms cradled between two pieces of their savory bread. I ripped a small piece of the bread off to taste and it reminds me of a popover. Yum! I get to work on my fork and knife sandwich and my bf starts on his soup. My steak was seasoned very well and the whole thing was delicious (mind you I could only finish half). My boyfriend ate all of his bread and soup which he really enjoyed. I tasted it. It was savory and reminded me of home.   We will definitely be back to try more of the menu. Everyone was very nice and when we paid our bill the woman who helped me (I presume the owner) gave us a free chocolate bar from their mini shelf of goods for sale.   I recommend people give this place a try. It can be intimidating to try new cuisine from different cultures, but it is well worth it.",

While the lamb tasted OK,  it wasn't as hot as it should have been and there wasn't enough rice to eat it with. It definitely wasn't worth what I paid for it,  considering I left still hungry. Worse yet, the service was really bad. Despite the fact that there was only one other occupied table (though I was in first), I spent 10 or 15 minutes with my empty plate in front of me waiting for the server to notice me (to order a decent baklava and Turkish coffee) because he was playing on his phone.  The other server (owner lady I think) was busy chatting with the Bosnian customers behind me the whole time and never looked over to see if I needed anything. Additionally,  the ice water tasted rusty so I couldn't drink it. On the bright side, the restaurant looked a lot better on the inside than the outside aesthetically. I typically like family businesses and ethnic foods so I don't like to give such a low rating, but I hope they see this review and work harder to improve.  If I'm ever near that area again, I might come back in another time to try something different (like the well reviewed sandwich) to see if my experience is better and improve my review.",

I'm not claiming a lot of expertise in their national cuisine but the meat I was served in Old Town Sarajevo was not neither beef nor pork, it was (maybe not completely) meat sub-products, it did not look brown, it looked dark red. I'm not a fan of that stuff. But my male colleague said it tasted just fine. Turkish coffee was good, on the other hand.",

Their food reminds me Turkish food but it is a little different. For breakfast and lunch try their Borek(with chese or groundbeef) and Sundays they do Lamb on skewer. Their Borek IS JUST LIKE MY MOMS. How can I not like this place. The reason for 4 stars is smoking. They should not smoke inside.",

    "text": "Right on the front window is a gigantic painting of the Bosnian sausage sandwich, and it deserves the place of honor! This is a casual hole in the wall with a small grocery section in the back. Everything we tried was delicious. My husband had the Bosnian sausage sandwich and a cheese pita. I had a meat pita and bean soup. My daughter had a plain gyro, which she pronounced as the best gyro she's ever had. The sausage sandwich and the gyro came on a wonderful fluffy bread that appeared to have been browned on a grill. Next time we go, I'm definitely ordering extra bread! The pitas are not the flat bread sandwiches that you might be expecting. Instead, they are made with a flaky pastry like filo. The filling is wrapped in the pastry and twisted in an oblong spiral shape. For dessert, I had baklava, which seemed to have even more honey sauce and nut filling than most - very tasty!  Our server was very friendly and explained the whole menu to us. The atmosphere is homey and there is a notable sense of community that gives you a wonderful taste of Bosnian culture.",

I love it when they understand how to make the custmer feel at home.    Cant wait to try everything on the menu.  :)",

It is legit-- the cevapci (small sausages) were really good and the bread it came with was awesome. When I was ordering I was torn because they also have burek, which is basically a pie with meat or cheese and is delicious. (Next time I'm in Phoenix I guess...) They also have Bosnian coffee-- yum.  Check this place out for a little BiH in the states.",

The decor is super cute - you can tell they put a lot of time and effort into the atmosphere. It appeared to be a popular spot for take-out food as there were several people who came in to pick up. Our food came out quick and hot and yummy! My only complaint is the general lack of variety in the food. We ordered the traditional bread and sausages - all of which was good - but they only come with dippers. There are no real \"sides\" on the menu. More than okay, but it would really complete the meal if there was more. Overall, would definitely return if on that side of the valley.",

    "text": "Great place and my first real experience with Bosnian food! We went in and ordered the cabbage rolls, chicken sandwich, and sausage. The chicken sandwich was served open-face with bread, mushrooms, and some sort of sauce. Quintessential comfort food. Everything were good and pretty much tasted like they'd been cooked in someone's kitchen at home- but done well. The service was friendly overall and the whole place was much nicer on the inside than it appeared on the outside. Prices were pretty inexpensive. Coffee at the end was yummy and traditional style (don't drink to the bottom of the cup). Only odd thing was that after our meal the waitress/owner disappeared for a good 20 minutes while we waited for the check. We finally went up to the counter and shuffled around enough that she poked her head out and rang us up. She gave us some chocolate bars to take home, and when we left we realized that the restaurant was well past closing time, and that in fact we had walked in only about 30 minutes before closing time (it was midafternoon on a weekend and we hadn't checked the sign on the way in). I'm not sure if it was a culture or language issue that she didn't mention something about them closing soon, but it was a bit strange. Overall we'd definitely come back.",

It's definitely an immigrant restaurant and any non-Bosnians might feel a but strange at first, but the waiter is super friendly and very welcoming. Definitely check this place out if you are in the mood for something authentic.   And for all you posters out that made comments about not finding Bosnian products or authentic restaurants in NY or LA, that's because you aren't looking in the right city. St. Louis is home to the largest population of bosnians outside of Bosnia. Checkout the Bevo Mill area for a large selection of Bosnian restauarants and markets.",

    "text": "I've never had any experience with Bosnian food or any foods from that part of Europe before prior to entering Cafe Sarajevo.   I had somewhat of an idea of what it would consist of based on my sparse knowledge of culture and history though.   Like others have said, bring your passport because entering this establishment is going to Bosnia. Just the name of the place is novel or movie material.   My friend and I were the only non Bosnians in the place. Kind of hard to explain, but the place did have a mafia vibe to it. Maybe it's from excess Hollywood exposure, or maybe it's because I'm from NE Philadelphia where there definitely IS a mafia presence there, albeit Russian.   I had the cevapi, and my friend had the patty version of it. Food is hot, fresh, and cooked on the spot. Their special bread is also baked fresh on the premises. The flavors are real simple and has a soul food feel to it regardless of what your ethnic background may be. We also enjoyed some imported sodas, bitter lemon soda and \"cockta\" (wonder why this didn't take off here?) which is a mix of coke and creme soda.   To top it off, the items are priced as if you were in a foreign country (where the dollar is actually above the local currency mind you)! Five bucks for a hot, fresh, cooked meal? That's fucking crazy, and in a way it captures some of that old world spy novel Cold War era nostalgia to it as well.     I recommend coming to this place and trying it out, well worth the trip. Or, if you were scheduled to meet a contact and make a drop in the area, stop in for lunch. Just make sure to leave with a different briefcase than the one you came in with.",

I've never tried Bosnian food and decided to go here. Good choice. There was almost nothing on the menu that didn't sound delicious. Everyone at our table loved their food, and dessert was amazing. It was super cheap too. From the quality of the food, and judging by how nice the restaurant looks, I'd expect to pay a lot more. This place is a work of art inside. It reminded me of my honeymoon in Montenegro. I've never been to Bosnia, but if I had been there, I suppose it would remind be of Bosnia lol. Anyway, this place was so good we came here the next day before driving back home to CA. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'm coming here again. I'm bummed that I can't find a single Bosnian restaurant within an hour's drive of where I live. Such good food!  Update: I'm planning another trip to Phoenix just so I can eat here. I'm having withdrawals. It's that good.",
