We did have a plane to catch, so we were a bit rushed; service is a tad slow.  Full menu of gyro's falafels, hummus plates, salads, burgers, Chicago hot dogs, pasta dishes (seems unusual for a Greek place) and more.  I had the falafel pita and the Greek salad; pita was fresh, falafels were home made and delicious.  the Greek salad was tasty, greens, dressing, olives, feta, etc.  soooo good. Husband had the chicken sandwich, it had a nice charbroiled flavor and a good marinade, very good.  Sis had the hummus, very tasty, too bad we had no room for dessert!  Place is clean and friendly, service was a bit slip b manageable.",

Other than that food is good quality. I love their gyro's, chicken pita's, salads and fries. The cashier that is normally there is a little weird and I think she has OCD.

I love that the gyro has an array of flavors and it's not just full of meat but it was lots of sauce and some vegetables like onions and tomatoes! That's how I like my gyro to be made.   If you get the gyro with the side salad, it's a lot of food. The salad is a decent amount. The salad uses iceberg lettuce though and I am not the biggest fan of iceberg lettuce. It's overall pretty good though.   George works there as well. He's a nice guy and was helpful in answering any questions I had!",

I've had their steak sandwich too - its weird how they package it kind of like an open faced sandwich, but it's decent.  It's chopped bite sized pieces of sirloin.  They season it pretty well but its a tiny bit tougher than I like.  The fries are decent though I like them crispier.  Everything tastes pretty fresh.  I kind of prefer the greek salad which they do a great job with, and you get a lot.    The baklava is also a wonderful addition to your meal.  I wouldn't get the chicago hot dog or anything, but other items are priced well so you get a pretty good value for your money.  The food is freshly made, seasoned well, and portioned nicely.  The wait is a bit long if you don't phone in your order ahead of time but this place is definitely a try if you're in the neighborhood.",

It rocks the divey-tucked-in-a-strip-mall ambiance that often signals hidden gems. But, to be perfectly honest, the food was average.   We started out with dolmades, which were crafted very neatly. The texture didn't tend toward slimy, like sometimes happens when they are done incorrectly. I had the souvlaki gyro sandwich with a Greek salad. The pita was so stuffed that I ended up eating it with a fork. The pork was still moist, but it could have been more flavorful. The salad was meh as well, but I'm fairly picky about my greens.  However, I will say that service was incredibly friendly. I might give George's another go and order something else based on this alone.",

    "text": "George's Famous Gyros is located in a slightly ghetto strip mall next to a gas station, \"massage\" parlor, hole-in-the-wall Mexican food joint, and a mail box store. From the outside it may not look like much but upon entering the dark exterior you immediately find that this is quite the popular lunch spot!   My friend, Jillana, and I ventured into this hot spot at around 12:30pm on a Thursday. The tables were packed and there was already 6-7 people in line ahead of us. Despite the crowd our food was served in a matter of minutes and the owner, operating the cash register, noticed that we were new customers and offered up drinks on the house. A rarity for today's economy! The owner was extremely helpful and attentive (readily changed our order from din in to to-go and made sure we had plenty of napkins and plastic-ware before he sent us on our way).   The place itself is rather small but has a rather fun, lively lunch vibe to it. I always love the 80's posters of the attractive Greek bushy-eyebrowed brunette enjoying a big gyro :-) Not sure how busy it is around the dinner hour but it seems that this place will certainly not be going out of business anytime soon.   My friend and I both opted for the classic Greek gyro, costing only $7.30 after tax. Great prices! The sandwich was quite tasty. The meat was well seasoned, packed with flavor. The fries were quite good and my friend thoroughly enjoyed her Greek side salad. The only drawback was that the meat was a tad on the greasy side for my taste. However, this would not deter me from frequenting George's. Next time I would ask for extra tzatziki, there was some on the sandwich but I would have liked a bit more. Plus, I love dipping my fries in the rich creamy goodness as well.   Overall, quite a good experience. Price, good. Service, good. Food, goooooood.",

Luckily for me I live very close to George's and he honestly makes one of the best gyros I've ever had.   Their greek salad/gyro combo is an awesome lunch, definitely hits the spot. And he'll give you a free drink every now and then if you don't order it. Nothing better than a gyro and iced tea on a hot phoenix day. I cannot get enough of this place! I looked it up online and George is only 27 and owns/runs this restaurant. That makes me want to come back and support his efforts often. Good for him! The rest of the staff are all very friendly and do a great job at keeping the service fast and quality!",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of this place. Sadly, I haven't tried that many dishes because every time I go in, I HAVE to get the gyro and the greek salad. I hope one day to be able to broaden my palate and report on their other dishes.   The gyro is good - YES as another reviewer stated, it's greasy. That's why it's yummy. Skip the fries, they are nothing special compared to the other two sides available. The white rice with tomato sauce is awfully tasty but the greek salad is my favorite and it's what I get every time now. Nice fresh lettuce and a variety of veggies! I'm so picky about that.  Disappointment: One day while the cook rang me up for my gyro plate (Feeds 2 for under $10, you can't beat it) he was telling me how great his baklava is. So when I went to a dinner party the next week I stopped in and bought some to bring for dessert. Sadly, the baklava was not to my personal liking. It was chock-full of nuts as he described but there was not enough phyllo dough or especially HONEY for my tastes. Rather dry and nutty, not sweet enough for me. Oh well!",

George's Famous Gyros is a place around the corner from where i live so I indulge myself from time to time with their gyros. They truly are the best in town that I've had. The meat is moist and tasty (bordering on greasy) and stuff into the pita. You'll never think they skimped on it, it overfills the pita. Great stuff, that I wouldn't recommend having on a daily basis but man in that moment there are few things better. They really should get a mobile version of this and open up at 2am to clean up with the drunk crowd.",

    "text": "I had a great lunch here today.  Got the classic gyro, which comes with fries or a side salad, and a drink.  I think in total it was about 9 bucks.  The gyro was great...tender, juicy meat.  The fries were pretty good as well...sprinkled with salt and pepper and pretty crunchy.  It's always the best to put the fries in the gyro...adds another dimension to it.    I only had two complaints about my lunch.  The pita was a bit soggy, but nothing major...almost just a little too moist and chewy for me.  Also, it took a little while for the food to come out.  I was on my lunch break and a little strapped for time and was hoping it would be a quick lunch.  The place was packed though...so by no means am I holding it against them.  All in all a pretty tasty spot.  The menu was pretty extensive with different types of gyros and shawarmas.  They had burgers as well.  Definitely looking forward to going back for another lunch.",

All I can say to not repeat prior posts is for a casual place, you get more than you money's worth in both quality and quality.  If the same food were served at twice the price in a more upscale setting, I would say it is less exciting.  But my expectations were exceeded.  My only criticism: the hummus is visually appealing and has excellent texture, but could stand more flavor, maybe a liitle touch of garlic.",

    "text": "After reading all the other reviews, I was excited to try out George's with my husband. We normally go to Pita Shack in Tempe when we are looking for a good Gyro but we were on the north side of town and wanted to grab a quick dinner. Looked up some options on Yelp which is what led us to Georges. My husband ordered the Gyro with jalapenos, onions and peppers and I ordered the traditional Gyro with a side salad. We also ordered some Spanakopita and 2 drinks. Honestly the best thing about the meal was the side greek salad. Gyro meat was cold... which was kind of a bummer as we waited just about 15 minutes for the two pitas to come out. What really irked me was after we had checked out and were waiting for our food, a group of guys walked in and the girl asked if it was their first time in and since it was, offered up complimentary drinks. It wasn't like they were busy when we came in, she was just very short and didn't feel like engaging with us. Maybe an off night for the staff and food, but I wouldn't be inclined to go back.",

The prices are slightly lower than what you would expect for the food quantity, but when you factor in the quality, you are getting a great deal.  This is a place where you will see construction workers and office people eating and no one leaves hungry or has to order extra.     The service at this restaurant is outstanding. They work from a small counter and with the efficiency of people that know their jobs inside and out.  They know many customers by name but even if they don't know you when you come in, you will feel like they do when you leave.  They manage to do that even when very busy.    Finally the food.  Great food, great quality, great quantity.  Don't think this place is only about Greek food.  They have an extensive menu.  I have not had anything bad here.  But the best part of any time I come is asking the owner, Z, what he has special and different.  The main menu remains fairly static. However they always have something on the chalkboard. Take a few minutes and ask them what's special and different. If Z is there, which he almost always is, you will be treated to a tantalizing explanation of something new he is trying. And his passion for food is incredible. It is worth the trip just to talk to him about his food.  Again this is a great restaurant with a great owner a great staff and great food. Enjoy.",

Now, be prepared if you hit the lunch rush to wait.  This place is jamming during that time with all the local businesses and contractors.  I highly suggest pre-ordering!  Bummed they close at 8, but they've got lives too!   The staff is always laid back and friendly. George is.the.jam. He's super nice, hilarious and appreciates his customers.  There is always something cool on tv, be it new or from days of yore. His business also always contributes to our yearly Christmas charity for kids. Decent.  Ok, to the food. There is nothing bad on the menu. The gyros are great. The salads are great. The pizza and pastas are great. My favorites are the spanakopita and the dolmades.  Though they are appetizers, the abundance of food makes for a great finger food lunch as well! Not feeling Greek? They have American and Italian selections as well.  To the reviewer commenting on the cold dolmades, if you have been in AZ a while, you may notice that most are served this way, especially since they are not meat dolmas. I will tell you this...if you want something a certain way to which you are accustomed, just ask! The staff at George's will certainly oblige if you want your dolmades hot.  I make changes and omit ingredients all the time and they are super cool.  If you enjoy basic Greek, you must patronize this establishment.",

If I am ever in the area and I wanted a gyro I would go here for it. I do wish they put more sauce in the gyro but o well. My sister got the gyro with a side salad and the side salad was a greek salad which was still pretty big for a side. I have had better gyros in California though.",

I know the strip mall screams THIRD WORLD COUNTRY. Especially with the run-down Circle K and dirty sidewalks. So that loses them a star. If you're paying rent, as a tenant you should demand some cleanliness around the place.   My friend had the gyro but since I don't eat lamb, I chose a chicken pita. With only three tables, they still brought our food to the wrong table, plus my side was wrong. The food was good, not outstanding or fabulous but it was good.   One minus star is for having a DESERT menu. Don't we already have enough desert in Arizona? When I mentioned the faux pas, I was told, ya they knew. They just didn't want to reprint menus. Wow...",

I've had it in a original gyro as well as a daily special called a 'greeksteak' [I believe] that is basically a cheesesteak with gyro meat. Both are awesome! I still need to try the italian style with marinara and mozzerella. The portions are extremely generous, I usually have leftovers unless I am super hungry.  I also really enjoyed the hummus. They serve it with warm pitas, which is a great touch that sets them apart from a lot of other places. Also, the greek salad that you can sub for the fries is fantastic! I'm not a fan of fries with a gyro, too much starch, so it is nice to have another option.  They have a rewards program called Belly. Each time you eat there you scan your card and get 5 points. You can save your points and redeem for different rewards, like a free drink, free meal, or even creating and having a gyro named after you on the menu!",

She is passionate when describing menu items and puts in 110% effort consistently. While I was waiting for my food on a busy Thursday afternoon, I watched her handle what could have been a stressful lunch shift with grace. When she only had 1 minute in between answering the phone and bagging food orders, she ran over to the dining area quickly to push in chairs, wipe down the tables, and even wiped up a small ketchup spill on the floor. Her energy, passion, and drive to serve customers makes this place amazing. Thank you, Katie for making a great day even better!!",

I've never eaten there so I can't comment on service but the takeout food has not disappointed.  The Gyros Picado platter is gyro meat piled with grilled jalapenos, peppers, onion, choice of rice or fries (my choice is rice), and a feta salad.  There's tons of food, it's really spicy with all the grilled veggies, and the feta salad is FABULOUS.  So good in fact that I ask for an extra side of it ~ and at $1.50 it's a great deal!    The tsaziki sauce (spelling?)  is really good too & I love smearing it on my bread before piling on the goodness.  They usually give me about 3-4 containers of it if iI ask nicely.   It's 'divey' but,  the food's good so give it a try.  I'm looking forward to trying all the other stuff on the menu.",

When a friend suggested Greek food, I remembered there was a new place in the Papago Center on the corner of McDowell and Scottsdale Road.  Well, come to find out that place is also called George's Gyros (without the famous.)  Sounded shady to me and seems like that place is trying to steal business from the original.  So, we took the extra few minutes to make sure to google and get the right place.     It was my 1st time eating lamb as guilt always took precedence over the deliciousness of a baby animal.  But, when my friend insisted that we order take out I finally gave in. I ordered a Greek salad (instead of fries) along with a kabob and just in case I didn't like lamb, a side of (cant remember name) rice rolled in a grape leaf.   We placed our order over the phone and after 20 minutes we went and picked it up.  It was ready and hot.  George told us there was only about 20% lamb and the rest was beef.  The whole meal was delicious.  There was plenty of leftovers for a 2nd meal.  I will definitely be back to George's FAMOUS Gyros.",

I heard the cook say he lost our ticket and the girl at the front desk found it in the garbage. At that point our ticket should have been placed in front to get our order out with only two orders in front of us. Instead it was placed at the end.   There were 3 cooks...come on! 3 cooks should have been able to get this order out on time and correctly.   When I questioned I got every excuse in the book. I was told all the orders in front of us were called in. When I mentioned that I saw they lost our ticket she gave me another excuse. I asked for my money back and she said our meal would be up next then gave me two free lunch tickets.   Two more orders came up and went out so I asked for my money back. She then had the audacity to ask for the free tickets back. Never apologizing for the wait just saying basically it was our fault for not calling in the order.  Our food came up so we took it however when we got home the order was wrong anyway.   Both the Gyro and beef were DRY. No sauce on the side as asked for and no juice for the beef.   I may have given them another chance had they apologized, gave me the free lunch cards and maybe taken the desert off. The girl up front was so rude and NOT customer friendly that I will never go there again and anyone who asks...I will tell them the food is just OK at best but the service sucks so bad they shouldn't go.",

I don't know what they do to their meat to make it so much better than other greek places but it is unreal.

I had the Greek salad; while the base was a bag salad mix, the vinaigrette and other ingredients were delicious.  The burger patties (which my sons ordered) are nothing special (but hey, it's a Greek restaurant, not a burger joint) but the buns are homemade and topped with a delicious Dijon mustard.  I'd say stick with the gyro menu items (duh) and you'll be happy.  Restaurant was clean and orderly (George was bussing the tables himself!).  The only reason it's a 4/5 is because of the bagged salad mix and what I think may be store-bought hamburger patties; otherwise great food!",

I had the original and will probably have it again until I decide to be adventurous and try one of the many other combinations.    I had a good chat with George while my gyro was being prepared and appreciated him taking time to talk because my gyro was ready before I knew it.  It was just an all around good experience.",

And its easy to find George here working hard to make sure you get the best.   \"A SMALL RESTAURANT  BECOMES THE ANCHOR  LOCATION FOR ITS SISTER shops, HOW RARE\"  I have tried all the Gyro spots in the immediate area. Georges is the Best bar non.  From the meat quality to the portion size, the meat is not weighed out the sandwiches are expected to be more than enough. The fries are great and you can sub them for a healthy salad.  Lots of veggies and a great dressing.    \"There is something to be said for a small restaurant that becomes the anchor location for its sister shops, how rare and exciting for the Valley.  Seeing a business succeed today allows me to value the spot so much more.  Thanks George, Your Gyros Are Famous!

The good thing is you can get your gyros with a salad or fries.  I always get it with the salad to add some vegetables to my diet.  The salad is a greek salad with a variety of vegetables, not your typical iceburg lettuce salad.  I wish the gyros meat was a little crispier.  Lots of meat as stated above and  the pita bread is warmed so it's nice and tender.  I always get a little extra tzaziki sauce because there is so much meat.  Best to call ahead if you're in  rush.  Considering it's about 5-7 minutes from downtown Scottsdale, it's a nice alternative to eating there.  Also the prices are great, but the location makes you think you got lost.",

    "text": "Hi All!  This review is long overdue!  I have been to Georges numerous times, I have brought friends and family from Chicago as well.  I have to say Georges is my FAV Gyros place around!  The prices are fair and the food is very good.  I have only had Gyros but one of these days I will try something else.  The gyros sandwich comes with a choice of fries or greek salad.... I always get the salad, never tried the fries.  The salad is always a nice amount with a perfect amount of dressing...not too much but enough and it has feta, onion and even those yummy klamata olives.  The tzaziski is chunky and flavorful and is good for dunking anything in or eating plain.  The meat is well seasoned and ample and I have yet to be dissapointed!  One think I always look for when making repeat visits to any business is consistency and I have George to always be consistent.  A few visits ago the owner brought my friend and I a piece of  Baklava to sample and I would have to say.....the BEST I've ever had!  Sweet and savory but not that drippy saturated sweet, the perfect end to a good meal!  My only CON is that it takes an unusually long time to get the food, therefore I am not sure I would go there for lunch if you are on a time restriction.  Keep it up guys....you have rated high in my rating system!  I do reccomend Georges and really think you should give it a shot.  and until you do.........  Bon Appetite'",

    "text": "As many of you know, as a college student, our first priority is to save $$$ and get the most bang for our buck. Once George's Famous Gyros entered my world, everything seemed perfect! George's offers some of the freshest and most delicious Greek cuisine I have found in Arizona.   I can gladly recommend their chicken pita. This comes with either a garlic sauce or a gyro sauce, onions, and a pita crammed with sliced seasoned chicken breast. You also have a choice of great tasting fries or a bomb greek salad. All this for $6.75.  I also can recommend the cheese ravioli (cheese ravioli with marinara covered in melted mozzarella cheese) and the Greek pasta salad (rotini pasta with chopped vegetables, feta, with vinaigrette topped with either chicken or gyro meat.  The only downside to George's is that it's only open until 8PM during the week, open until 3PM on saturdays, and closed sundays. Being a college student, my schedule is pretty hectic, and I find myself eating dinner anywhere from 6PM to 12AM, so I generally frequent George's for lunch time. Another downside is the inside. It's pretty no frills, but what it lacks in interior design, it makes up in food quality and taste.  I give George's an easy 5 stars when it comes to DELICIOUS and FRESH Greek food.",

George and Z the owners are great people. The atmosphere is very laid back and kid friendly. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone as there is a variety of foods to choose from.

    "text": "How do they do it?    George's Famous Gyros in Scottsdale (McKellips & Miller) has two combinations I love: great price with huge portions.  Top it off with really good quality, homemade desserts and specials every day, and you have yourself a winner for Greek lunch fare.  In particular, I'm talking about the Gyro Platter (don't confuse with the regular Gyro), which offers two Pitas, a Greek salad, a HUGE pile of crispy and succulent Gyro meat, and french fries.  This platter costs only $9.25 and will feed TWO very big appetites, and probably 3, or even 4, regular to small appetites.  I enjoy it so much I've neglected to try all the other items, except for their Baklava and bread pudding.    Disclaimer: I'm no Baklava connoisseur, but it wasn't the best I've had, due to it seeming a bit dry to me.  (Note I did only try it once.)  The bread pudding was very good, and I appreciate that they make different desserts - it's not always the same.  They have their staple items, such as hummus, pita platters, falafel, tsaziki, Greek salads, and daily lunch specials, etc.  It's enough for you to go back every day for two weeks and not have tried everything.  Their ingredients are good quality, food made to order and tasty.  The accommodation space is setup as a lunch type place.  They use styrofoam plates and plastic forks, emphasizing the fast and delicious aspect, if that gives you an idea.  It's got about 12 tables that seat 4, and a couple tables outside.  I didn't expect to see a good Greek stop at this location, only finding it due to using Yelp.  Don't let that fool you.  Bottom line: If you like Greek food at an absolutely great price, good variety, quality and quantity, you can't beat George's Famous Gyros.",

On the first visit I tried the platter which I thought was good overall with the exception of the Greek salad which I mostly skipped over. On the second visit I tried the chicken pita w/ fries and thought that was just okay. The chicken seemed a bit too dry and lacked flavor for me. I will probably have to try something else from this place as I have mixed thoughts about their food at the moment...  The customer service here is good. There is a lady at the front who seems to take good care of her regular customers. It was nice and refreshing to see that.",

First thing I noticed it is that even though is in a  more industrial area people from the area still drives in for To Go orders.   Right when you come in you are treated by a very attentive and friendly server.  You order in the bar area and then they serve your food.   $10 for a Gyro platter that comes with a side salad. Lots of food for the price! The meat is jucy and tender, well seazoned. It comes with french fries or rice.   I also had a side of falafel ~$5. They were perftly fried, crunchy in the outside and soft in the inside.   I would love to come back.  Cheers!",

Her welcoming smile, efficiency taking orders , and her genuine kindness combined with subtle flattery that encourages you to finish your day after your lunch break ends.  I don't know her name, but I do know that face, and I certainly appreciate the service.

Tons of chicken, bell peppers, onion, olives, feta, cucumbers and a greek dressing. I've had the mac n cheese bites with creamy gouda, so delicious. We did a chicken gyro with their homemade tzasiki sauce. It came with fries which were noce and hot and then we had the baklava. So delicious and nutty, not too sweet.

Called ahead and ordered the original gyro with fries and was ready to go by the time I got here. Have to say I wasn't dissappointed. The portion was huge with gyro meat piled high atop a lowly peice of pita bread. I had to take off meat and put it aside just so i could take a bite! Not a bad problem to have.. definetly a first world problem! The fries werent bad either for not being McDs. The gyro meat was well seasoned--a little greasy but who cares.. still delicious! I'll have to order a side of Tzatziki next time since the meat to tzatziki ratio was out of whack! I'll definetly put this on my list of places to eat when I'm absolutely starving!

There is absolutely nothing good about this gyro except the quantity of meat.  There is essentially a pinch of lettuce, tomato and onion.  The sauce is there, but without much taste.  I've had better food at the ball game.    I think I will quit med school and just open up a gyro shop because apparently there is no competition since no one in Tempe knows how to make a gyro.  I guess all the Greek paraphernalia is analogous to an incompetent doctor with a great bedside manner, just because you look the part doesn't mean you are going to deliver in the end.",

    "text": "I was missing my old neighborhood in Queens (shout out to Astoria!) as I sometimes do, and found myself craving a Greek salad. Not just an ordinary Greek salad, but one piled high with fresh produce and charcoal grilled juicy chicken breast. I knew it would be a task to find one near my Old Town apartment, but one day BF had a gyro craving and off we went.   After referencing Yelp, we had narrowed it down to George's Gyros and George's Famous Gyros (I'm in front of Ray's pizza! Famous Ray's? No, just original Jerry!). We actually decided on the non-famous George's, but they were closed on Sunday so our decision was made for us. I'm so glad we ended up here, though-it was delicious!   We ordered take-out and placed our order at the counter, so we waited about 10-15 minutes which ended up being just enough time to scope out the staff (who have fun with their job which I love!) and the location (with the office door marked \"Pirate\"). We also enjoyed the soda fountain-this is a Coca Cola establishment, hooray! And they have a good syrup-to-soda-water ration which is hard to find. Now, on to the food...  BF's gyro was GINORMOUS and stuffed to the brim with tasty gyro meat. He gave me a bite (so generous!) and it melted in my mouth. He conquered half of it before saving the rest for later, which he said was just as good cold. The fries that came with it were good, but I will warn you that they gave us Hunt's ketchup packets, so make sure you have your own ketchup at hand if you are like me and have an aversion to Hunt's.   My Greek salad was even bigger than the sandwich-TONS of grilled, moist, juicy chicken on top of a *big* salad. And they accommodated my request for no peppers or olives (which, yes, I know, makes it not a \"Greek\" salad but whateva) which was really cool. There was an abundance of fresh lettuce and veggies, and it was more than enough for two meals. It came with two containers of an oil and vinegar dressing, and hit the spot JUST like my fave Astoria haunts. And it came with garlic bread! Super buttery and crispy and plain delicious.   Oh! And the kicker was that both meals came to under $20 including tip, PLUS we got two drinks for free since we checked in with Yelp. I will be back for sure!",

My dining partner and I walked in at 7:54pm yesterday (12/18/13). The door was wide open, all the lights were on, people were inside eating, and the gyro meat was still in the rotisserie in the kitchen. No one was at the counter so we stood around deciding what to eat. Someone working there came in through the front door, so he wasn't even IN the restaurant. He immediately told us they close at 8, which it now was since we had to wait. We were turned away and walked out the door at 8:02.  We went down the street to Philly's and gave them our money since this place didn't seem to want it.",

They do have a young boy working the cashier/taking orders and he did okay for his age. The service was poor. I think this place lacks people skills. No one follows up to ask how your food was. Okay, yes...it's a small place and maybe the workers might be young, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't check on your customers. And they certainly didn't follow up to bring my baklava (that they forgot to give me in the first place). The food was...well...just like their service, it was poor.

This place is a sure winner! Then we got the Nutella cheesecake just because! WOW! Gotta try it!",

    "text": "So I visited this palace last night. My friends have all recommended this place so I was certainly excited to see what the fuss was all about. It's a very hole in the wall place, but in my experience those are the places that have the best food. Not to judge a book by its cover, I ordered the chicken supreme. It has a vast menu but as I don't eat lamb, I couldn't order the Gyro. The food was great as a whole. My one disappointment was that the meat was not tender. It tasted closer to \"Chipotle\" chicken than what one would expect from a spit roasted authentic shawarma joint. Ill come back again probably, but order something different.",

My office partner and I are training in Tempe/Scotsdale area for work from California and we found this little gem. First of all the girl at the front is doing the job of ten people at once and is constantly running(taking orders, phone orders, delivering food, etc) but always keeps her cool and she's super sweet. We came twice in a row since the first time was so freakin good! Both times I got the chicken pita and my co-worker got the lamb gyro. Amazing each time with massive portions. Definitely the best pita I've ever had. Be prepared for a little wait because they are super busy with a tiny staff and small kitchen but it is so worth the wait. The saddest part about going back home will be leaving this place behind. Great job you guys! Come franchise in Sacramento any time :)",

Not sure what to make for dinner? Just go to Georges gyros and get yourself a half chicken half gyro platter with extra taziki sauce.  you'll have enough food left over to take to lunch the next day... they give you sooo much food. if you're feeling like a fattie for life like me,  get yourself a baklava for dessert.   helpful tip: call in advance. if you go in person and make the order you will end up waiting 15 mins or more.. they take a while to make their food.",

My favorites include The original gyro (duh!), The sausage and Peppers sandwich, dolmades, gyro pasta salad, shrimp mikanos, the chicken pita (w/ tzatziki), the veggie pita (add tzatziki) or any of their salads. George, Z and the crew are friendly and always take care of their customers.   I moved away to North County San Diego and man do I miss a good Gyro!

For $8.99 you can get an ample Gyro and either salad or fries and the whole thing is pretty filling. I had gotten mine with the salad however the fries looked nice and crispy. I wish I could make a salad like this at home, the combination of lettuce, feta, bell peppers, olives, onion, and cucumber is incredibly refreshing and pairs very well with the Gyro.  While waiting for the gyros my buddy and I split some pita and hummus. The pita is conveniently cut into triangles and served warm. The hummus had some olives and olive oil with it which was a nice treat.  Additionally, it's always nice when the people handling your food are kind. I'm pleased to say that the staff here are quite pleasant. :) There are some other curiosities on the menu that I'd like to try on the next visit. The garlic bread and pastas sounded pretty good.",

You know how I love lists, so here is a list of the things that we loved about this place: 1. Easily the best gyro meat we have ever had. Flavorful. Tender. The ideal texture. Just. Muah! *kissing motion* 2. The fries/salad were also awesome. Taaaaasty sides. 3. Generous portions. Holy cow, the gyros were gyro-normous! I almost had to use a fork! 4. The tzaztiki (I am butchering the spelling of that word) is out of this world. It, like the meat, has incredible flavor and texture-- not too much dill flavor/very creamy/not too thin. I'll take a bucket to-go, please. 5. There are  red and green bell peppers on the Gyro Supreme. YUM!  6. Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. The prices at the place are ridiculous (in a good way), considering the caliber of the food you receive. We paid less than $20 for two of us. Can't go wrong with prices like that. 7. Family owned/local business. We were able to meet the owner (George). Loved that! 8. The decor. This tiny little hole in the wall place has really adorable styling inside.  9. Free drink when you check in on Yelp. 10. Only 5 minutes from the house.  All in all, this discovery was a complete win. While we were there, Rob (the boyfriend) actually used the word \"out-%$@king-standing!\". Seriously. That good.  We will be back ASAP! Thank you, George!",

Despite the somewhat seedy atmosphere, however, the girl who took our order at the register (I believe her name was Katie) was extremely kind and helpful in describing the dishes and making suggestions. We sat at the tables outside after ordering, and Katie brought out our orders along with napkins and utensils.   Upon receiving the plates, our first impression was amazement at the incredible amount of food we had been served. We then were under the impression that we had died and gone to heaven after digging into the absolutely delicious food. We ordered a Chicken Supreme pita sandwich and a Gyro Platter. Both dishes were pretty standard in cost as far as gyros go, but like I said, we got so much food for what we paid for! There were also bottles of Sriracha to use, which I always appreciate, and we also got free drink coupons from checking in on our Yelp mobile apps.   This place is a MUST! The meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the tzatziki sauce was fresh and flavorful. Both meals came with salads which were incredible and very authentic, full of different veggies and topped with feta and a great oil dressing. We chose rice to accompany the platter which was basic white rice, but was the ideal complementary side. We also had the fries with the gyro which were thick cut and addicting!   I would highly recommend dining here  to anyone and I look forward to returning and trying additional dishes from the menu. The only advantages that their nearby competitor Oliveo Grill holds are the option of delivery and being open late (George's closes at 8 p.m.), but other than that the food at George's Famous Gyros is above and beyond!",

    "text": "Was craving a meatball sub and came here based on the reviews. Got it to go and it was out pretty quickly. It was about $7 for the sub and a side of fries. Got back to work to eat and it was still really hot and the cheese was all melty and the fries were still crispy. The only thing I'd change is that the marinara seems to be all poured on the top but not inside the bread. I like my meatball subs a little more saucy, but overall it was still good and a pretty decent price.   The girl at the front was super nice, and I didn't think the appearance is all that bad like others are saying. It's in a small strip/plaza but it's not like shady or gross outside. I was not intimidated in the least and I think inside was fine too, it's a smaller place but I'd prefer that over a big commercial chain any day.",

The gyro meat was tender and well seasoned which to me is always good news  Unfortunately I got a bite of grit or sand in one spot It was an unpleasant taste Perhaps some veggies were washed in haste?  I'm hoping the salad incident was only a fluke So that there's no real need to get spooked  Despite the grit it was overall a good tasting meal The price? $8.50, not too bad of a deal  I'd love to go back and check out more of the menu Since they have some pretty tasty selections at this venue!",

At 7 pm they were super busy! Shout out to the cashier with the light blue hair who was manning the front area alone and handled it like a champ! She was taking orders, bringing out food, answering the phone and providing exceptional customer service to everyone she encountered.   Their menu is very large and includes items that aren't traditional Greek or Mediterranean dishes so there's something for everyone. I ordered a Greek salad with chicken (huge and only $9) and an order of dolmades. Both were delicious and totally satisfied my Greek craving.   I'll be back soon to try some of their more unique items!",

I look forward to coming back and exploring more of their menu - they have lots of options and have something for everyone by the looks of it. Great service too! Thanks George's!",

So this comes with a nicely portioned Greek salad, 2 pitas, diced tomatoes, onions, a healthy portion of gyros meat and either fries or rice. However, the rice had marinara in it which was not tasty as all. I wish they would have mentioned that as I would not have ordered it. In addition, the rice was subpar. Didn't care for it at all. This is a small mom and pop place so if time is an issue, call ahead and order. It's in the middle of a strip mall so they have plenty of parking. The service staff was so amazing; they all were smiles and greeted everyone who came in. Would we go back? Maybe we would as the people were so nice. Maybe it was an off day for the kitchen?",

He was making too much noise because the chicken nuggets I ordered for him were still not ready after 30 minutes.  When I explained his situation to them,  they were not accommodating in anyway nor offered any solutions to getting the food on the table.  I asked for my money back and left.  The staff is unkind, snotty and arrogant.  They act is if they are running a five star restaurant with white table clothes and fine wine.  It's not Le Cirque, Baby and a perfectly appropriate place to take loud children.  In fact, it is a dump located in a strip mall between a massage parlor and a trailer park full of meth labs - a place where a loud disabled child should expect to be served and treated with respect.",

I had the chicken platter and subbed hummus for the rice. The hummus was very thick, different from what I am used to. The chicken was a tad dry, but good when mixed with the tzatziki sauce, which they make in-house. My husband said the original gyro was the best he's ever had. And I am not normally a french fry girl, but couldn't stop eating them off his plate. I was curious about the meatballs, and the guy behind the counter brought out a sample for me and the hubs to try. Delicious it was, as well as the sauce on top. Great service, too. Nothing fancy inside, but overall great food.",

Last night my boyfriend and I tried this place for the second time. He got the gyro and I tried a falafel for the first time. Both were so good and so filling! I had leftover falafel for lunch today. My boyfriend got the side salad instead of fries with his gyro and it was a pretty large portion with just the right amount of dressing on the side! Oh, and we also got fried mushrooms - also perfect!  We'll be frequent flyers of this place. There's definitely quite a bit on the menu I want to try!!",

The first night I stopped in and hadn't realized it was 15 minutes after closing time. Oops. The guy at the counter let me know and when I told him I was in for the first time while my wife was away he offered to get me a chicken gyro based on what was left. I decided to come back the next day.   The following day I swung by (on time!) and got a gyro and fries to go. It was less than 10$ and ginormous. Also a little bit of a wait so you know it's fresh and it was clear they make the fries fresh for the order. The meat was delicious and the sauce was good. The only thing I deduct a star for is actually being a little heavy handed on the meat and less so on the veggies and sauce which I prefer.   Overall I'm excited to go back next time the wife is busy.",

She doesn't usually eat meat but I wanted her to try the steak pita that I am in love with and also the fries which are most of the time TERRIFIC! I don't even care for fries normally, but leave it to George to serve some of the best french fries I've had.  Well, she actually ate steak...at a hole in the wall...and liked it...a lot! Ha HA!!! I make her eat it (her words). I was right, she was wrong. George's is good. I don't have to sleep on the couch tonight.  FYI, I like my steak pita marinated/cooked with the vinaigrette sauce and then I add ceaser dressing on top for even more flavor. MMmmmm...I can taste the onions, tomatoes, steak, and pita in my mouth dripping with flavorful juices and dressing. Yummy yummy yummy!  The chicken pita made the same way is great too. I'm just not a fan of the Euro sauce.",

I saw one guy go up and get a refund after an hour, and when he left what they said was \"oh he got all mad and left.\"  Actually, he had a limited lunch break like we all do and I know he waited longer than I did! Don't forget it's a small place, and we can all hear you. We love your food, George's, but unless you fix the wait we won't be back!",

I got the Original and my boyfriend got the Gyro Picado, which is really spicy with all the peppers and jalapenos. Both were really good, HUGE and like I sad, the meat was great. Apparently they make a lot of their own stuff right there. The tzatziki was one of the best I've had. George suggested I get one of the other dishes that has a Vodka Alfredo sauce next time. He said it's a favorite of the regulars. I forget what dish it's supposed to come on, but I'm sure if you mentioned it, he'd know! I'll definitely be back.",

Although that is to be somewhat expected with gyro's and cheesesteaks, I feel like they were greasier than gyros and cheesesteaks ought to be.   However, I would not recommend their desserts.  The service was also good.  The reason why I didn't give this place 4 stars is because it didn't really stand out in comparison to other places like the Phoenician (not during the summers), but it was definitely better compared to places like Oliveo.    I think I will need to give this place another try, however.  I will update as soon as I do.",

There is no such thing as too much and I'll never say it was, but adding an extra pita will greatly enhance your eating experience. Along with the gyro I had some of their tasty, crispy french fries which I'll ask them to add a portion of to my next sandwich, an Israeli delicacy that I very much enjoy. Though I took the food to go, the atmosphere of the restaurant reminded me of something you'd find in New York, lots of Greek art and maps plus a mediocre movie on television.

I have attempted to finish a whole one and haven't been able to do so. They are really generous with the meat and its awesome because I usually save the other half for lunch the next day. I love their fries and they give you a good amount of those also. I love the original gyro but I have been smitten with the picado gyro since I love me some spiciness!  The staff is super friendly and it seems like they all work together as a team to keep the restaurant going. The cashier is very nice and periodically checks on how customers are all doing. She stopped and had a conversation and talked about how's my people become regulars (and I can see why!). I will be coming here for the rest of my life! Best gyros in AZ in my opinion!",

However this place is run by Greek Chicagoans and was not a let down. My wife really enjoys the pasta there, especially one time when they made their special vodka sauce pasta. I really like their gyros, the meat is superb and plenty. Unlike some other Greek places I've tried in the area, this place is not only good but reasonably priced and you get a good quantity of food. I think I will stop checking other Greek places out, wasting my money, and just go to George's :)",

The place is clean and the music depends on the combination of who is working there that day. If George and Z, his friend, co-owner and cook, are on, you get an easy mix of classic rock and contemporary pop. If Geroge's father is working with George, you will get Greek music (which I love...stay long enough for the theme to \"Zorba the Greek\"). If George's father and Z are there, you get a mix of everything.  With the police station across the street, lunchtime is crowded but safe. Off hours is easy and the wait isn't long.  Friendly and very reasonably priced with specials posted that one should not ignore. I hear great things about the chili. One day I will order a Chili Gyro. They may look at me for a moment, but they will make one and probably add it to the menu.  Friendly and great service. Become a regular and you're part of the family. Opa!  4/20/11 - Sigh! I stopped at George's on my way out of town, moving back east. My \"last meal,\" so to speak and I have yet to find the equal anywhere. So, dear diners, enjoy the fine fare at George's because you may have no idea how rare the place really is.  At this point I'm ready to ask him to FedEx me a dozen Gyros... not that I would freeze any of them. I would just sit on the floor and roll around on them, naked. Well, maybe not... but I would eat them all in one sitting!",

I paid for extra tzatziki on the side for my side of fries.  The tzatziki on my falafel pita was so sparse (not close to the quantity in the 1 ounce side container) that I had to get some salad dressing to cover the pita with to make it edible.  Less than one slice of tomato was chopped up and 3 medium sized pieces of iceberg constituted the other pita ingredients.  The fries were mostly nicely spiced, and awesome with the tzatziki.  The pita?  Sucked.",

The food is delicious, varied, and affordable, and the service is generally sublime.    Sublime, you say, a carryout?  It does have a sizable dining area where one can eat, so it's not just a carryout.  When you enter, go up to the cash register, order and then someone will bring you your food.  If you're really lucky, that someone will be Katy, the cashier/waitress par excellence who seems to thrive when there's a crowd, which there usually is.  She is a master multi-tasker who can work the register, answer the phone, deliver the food to the tables and do it all with a smile on her face, as if you're the only customer in the place--quite an amazing accomplishment.  The menu has a lot of offerings including the standard gyros, souvlakis, and falafel.  The sandwiches come with salad or fries, or you can order a platter that comes with the meat,  breat, salad and fries, all for under $11.00.  I usually get the gyro sandwich supreme with fries and extra veggies in the gyro, very yummy, and all for just $8.50.  The falafel sandwich is also delicious, and well made.   The restaurant also has many pasta offerings, salads, soup, hamburgers, desserts--pretty much everything you would expect, plus a lot more.  The cheesecake is really delicious, by the way.  It carries Mexican bottled drinks, as well as the usual soda fountain drinks.  Overall, I love eating here.  It has a great vibe because of Katy and the owner, who are there most of the time.  It's very well run, clean, cheap, has good food and is relaxing,   Make this place one of your go-to restaurants.",

    "text": "I seriously can't believe how fantastic everything is at George's Famous Gyros. First of all, the cashier/waitress is curtious, sweet, engaging, polite, and so adorable. She was incredible with all the customers, even when slammed with customers and phone calls, and not only did she handle everything like it was nothing, she was concise, specific, and incredibly calm. She would be the reason to return alone.   Yet, there was amazing food as well. The dolmades were so fresh, you could taste the grape leaves and hint of lemon juice just melt on your tongue. The Tzatziki sauce was creamy, smooth, velvety deliciousness and just a dip into that sauce made you feel like you were on the Ocean in Greece. But wait...you must have the flaky, light, spinachy cheesy Spanakopita. It's golden brown filo dough handles the wildly original marinara dipping sauce with feta that is a mind explosion of flavors. And to cap my meal, I had to devour the delicate and slightly sweetened pistachio almond Baklava.  As I looked up when finishing this review, the store was slammed again with more customers who were digging into the Gyros and Pitas. Everything looks and smells so good you will want to come back again and again.",

It was fresh, spicy, flavorful... just delicious in all ways. While eating leftovers of this sandwich the next day I think I said 'I could just eat this forever it's so good.' So, I return the next week, order the same thing but... no magic! It was still good, but not nearly as good as the first time. What's a girl to do? I'll probably give it another shot, but know that this place isn't very consistent.   Ps their greek salad is super yummy and the dressing is awesome.",

If you're a big eater, get the platter.  For two bucks more, you get basically another entire gyro, along with a full plate of salad.  Food was tasty, and the service was quick and very personable - he came by to serve us our food and even stopped by to check on us and how we were liking our food, a very nice touch for a fast food place (I'm not sure if this falls under the fast food category, but it's not a sit-down restaurant, so let's just go with that).  It's a little out of the way for me, but definitely worth the drive!",

I lost my father just days before she lost hers so I had an idea of how awful this was. I ordered my food and then spoke with her and then she flipped out on me and started yelling at me and cursing at me and really scaring me. So I just asked one of the guys in the kitchen to please pack up my food to go ASAP. There was no way I was going to eat there, it was beyond uncomfortable. Fast forward to today. I called in my order and went to go pick it up. There was a gentleman in front of me paying for his order and Katie was helping him. She finished up with him went into the kitchen and sent (the owner) out to help me while the entire time I can hear her in the kitchen calling me pretty bad names and saying that I will never get served here again. It was pretty pathetic. I let the owner know that I heard everything she was saying and he kinda looked at me with disappointment as well. All I can say is wow! This was beyond unprofessional and it's very sad because the food here is amazing. I'd love to order here again but how do I truly know she's not going to spit on my food or anything?",

Mac & Cheese bites (Gouda) seem out of place with all the authentic Greek food but they were delicious.  The Falafel burger is rumored to become a permanent menu item - it deserves to be!  Delicious meat-less option served with a dinner salad (instead of fries) and I'm almost forgiven for having the mac and cheese bites!

The restaurant itself is small and not much to marvel at, until your food comes out!!  Food: lord help me this food is so good I could eat it everyday! The servings at George's are enormous (I can generally share it with someone)! I can always tell an affordable and hearty meal awaits when I see mainly men who do physical labor come in, one right after another. My meal however was even more hearty and delicious then I ever would have imagined! The amount of meat on my gyro was enough for two separate gyros at other Greek restaurants. Beyond that their fry's are amazing, (I'm really picky about frys) the Greek salad is a generous portion, and their baklava is to die for!  Service: I can't tell which is better, the service or the food. They have probably one of the sweetest humans as the cashier. This girl (I will have to get her name next time) says hello to all the regulars by name and genuinely asks them how their families are and so on. I'm by no means am a regular YET, but she always is so kind and welcoming. Even though it's obvious she doesn't have to, she always brings out our food and makes sure we don't need anything else. often times she will even pick up our plates for us. Mind you this isn't a sit down restaurant.   Tips: leave a tip!! This place is great and so is the staff!",

    "text": "Here for the first time letting Yelpers be my guide.  Wanted Greek spinach pie in the worst way as I hadn't eaten it in a LONG time.  George's is a simple store front restaurant where the menu is literally on the wall for all to see.  If you have questions you can go to the cashier/server.  We didn't know that she doesn't come to the table to take your order. So we kind of sat around staring at the menu/wall.  Then we had questions and went up to the lovely Katy, the young lady at the counter.  I say lovely because she was helpful and attentive and she thought we were a blast.  Hey, anyone who likes us that much can be called \"lovely\".  And yes, she really was.    Ordered the spinach pie which only came in appetizer portion and a pork soulvaki sandwich with fries.  Hubby ordered a pasta dish with green peppers, chicken breast and a garlic sauce.  His came with a huge side salad.  Everything appeared fresh.  The appetizer portion of the spinach pie had 6 triangular pieces.  Not so small for only $4.50.  Amazing.   My pork souvlaki sandwich served on a pita had onions and tzaziki sauce.  The french fries were well done as I had asked.  Pasta dish was enjoyed by hubby so no complaints there.   My sandwich was large enough to bring half home with some of the fries along with 4 pieces of the spinach pie.  What I am trying to say is that this place gives you portions.  No skimping here.   My only issue with my sandwich was that the pork had too much garlic and oregano.  Hubby thinks there is no such thing as too much oregano but you Yelpers out there know that too much of anything, especially oregano can overwhelm the food.   Hubby had no problem with the garlic and oregano in his dish as he found it to be dee-lish. Then again, it could be just me--everyone doesn't have the same palate.    So here you have it.  A simple greek place that doesn't take your order but smilingly brings it to your table and gives you great portions for very few \"drachmas\"   George's provides a good value in a clean and friendly environment.  All you Yelpers couldn't be wrong.  Thanks for the lead.",

I asked to make it a plate and was told that I would be charged for a gyro platter in addition to the gyro I had in front of me because I said plate and not platter. I was told, \"we don't have a gyro plate, we have a gyro platter.\" I've ordered dozens of times before and have never had a problem with the nit-picking of plate vs platter. They could have just thrown a scoop of rice in the box next to my gyro and charged me a dollar more and I would have been completely happy. Instead they chose to lose a customer of 3 years.",

It is homemade not the same from a tub sauce just about everyone else that does Gyros sells! Try other places and you will quickly taste the difference! In addition to the sauce the way they serve the meat keeps it juicy not dry like so many others. The Chicken Pita if filled with real grilled chicken. Here again try other places and you will see this overly yellow colored chicken stuff not what you see in his! The Porky Athens is wonderful as well. I have been a fan of Georges since he had the store on Country Club in mesa. In this spot he took a location that had been the home of 7 failed business over a few years and turned it into a busy successful place!  They sold it a few years back and it is not the same! We no longer eat there, instead making the drive to Scottsdale to get the best Gyro In Az period!",

    "text": "Georges Famous Gyros, on McKellips Rd., has more than just gyros.  Their meatballs (sandwich with 3 or spaghetti with 5) are really good.  I always get a salad with my food here and the Greek salad they make is consistently fresh and very good with a Greek style vinegar and oil dressing.  You can also get french fries.  The original gyro (my fav) with a salad is 4 meals for me.  The tzatziki sauce is a mild cucumber sauce that is a nice complement to the gyro meat, onions, tomatoes and pita bread.  If you want a spicier Gyro you need to get the Gyro Picado with grilled onions, peppers and jalapenos.  If I had any complaints about Georges it would be the fountain drinks.  This is a minor thing to me but could sway a customer.  Since I do not like sodas offered or any cola, etc., I will get the water or iced tea.  Their water needs to be filtered and could be better.  That would earn Georges another star with me.  And to Chris, whom posted that there is lettuce in their gyros, there is no lettuce in them.  That leads me to believe you have not eaten there and is a fake poster with another agenda.  Very disappointing.  Most of their meals are under $7.00 and as I said, I will get more than two meals out of them.  Also their Baklava is home made and a nice treat.  Oh, one more thing, the falafel is good.",

    "text": "A fantastic little locally owned dive in South Scottsdale. I can't count how many times I've driven past George's, but I never had a desire to stop in because the strip mall it's located in is pretty shady looking. But then I read all the good reviews and decided I had to check it out. I'm glad I did.   The menu (which is posted on the wall, and takes up a lot of space) is huge. In addition to the pitas, there are pizzas, sandwiches, pastas, burgers, platters, and appetizers (both Greek and American). The very friendly girl at the counter wasn't even able to tell me what the best items were, but that's because a guy sitting just inches away started to rave about everything. I decided to go with the Original Gyro (hey, the place is call George's Famous Gyros, after all. It's $6.75 and comes with a salad or fries (I went with the salad). I also tried the Baklava since the raving customer told me it was the best he's ever had.  The Gyro was phenomenal. As good as any Gyro place I've ever eaten at. It's all from Chicago, and you can taste it! It looks small at first, but you'll be surprised at how much meat the pita is filled with. I recommend paying the extra 25 cents for extra sauce. The Gyro is so stuffed with lamb, that you'll appreciate the flavor it adds. The salad is pretty big, but it's pretty much just a standard Greek salad. The Baklava was great, but pretty small even for it's $2.25 price. I would also suggest that George's drop the salad or fries and charge a dollar or two less for the Gyro a la cart. I really didn't want either, and would've preferred to save the cash. The wait for my food also felt a little long, but its probably because most of the food was made fresh, so I can live with that. I got my money's and taste bud's worth, and then some. I'll definitely be back at George's Famous Gyros to see what else is good here.",

The young gal at the counter was very nice and took my order. I watched as meals were delivered and the portions were huge compared to ther Gyro places in the valley. I order the \"Original\" Gyro and not only was it a lot of food, but it was very tasty! I'm adding this to my list of places to grab a Gyro! Also, the menu is very extensive. I highly recommend you go and check it out!",

After waiting 40 mins today, we found out they gave our lunch to someone else and couldn't remake it until they got a delivery in.    We know you have to wait for good fresh food but REALLY!!  This takes the cake!!  We're done.  Hopefully, he'll figure out how to fix his restaurant.  He recently spruced up the decor but that never was the problem.  Too bad!!",

Tucked away in the little strip mall that can best be called \"iffy\" you might wonder what am I doing here? Get past that and order the original gyro and YUMMY!!! They give you a LOT of food. The fries are always hot and plenty of them. My wife and I often split a meal for lunch. They have many many choices. The chicken pita is great too. Prices are not bad either. The only thing why they don't get the last star is they close at 8pm, and around 7pm the choices are kind of limited. But who cares, get down there early and pig out!",
