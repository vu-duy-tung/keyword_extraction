Service is good, despite them being super busy.  People complain about the food being mediocre, but that is to be expected from a mid-range, family style restaurant.  I think their food is better than Olive Garden, and Bucca de Beppo.  I have no complaints about this place if I want family style, cost-effective dinners.  If I wanted a high-end dinner, I would go to a fancier Northern Italian type of place and pay the price for such food.",

    "text": "Me and my family/friends are big rigatonys fans however, lately this place has been very hit or miss which is sad because it used to always be delicious. Sometimes I'll go and have a delicious meal, then the following visit the pasta sauce is watery and the service is slow. It's a very popular place and there's almost always a wait, even on weeknights so no doubt the food is good it's just that lately they've been having consistency issues.   Overall the food has been good the majority of the times I've visited (which is why I gave four stars)  But for an Italian restaurant the wine list is terrible. There's maybe 10 options to choose from total and none of them are actually quality wines. However they have plenty of food options to choose from and all of them include the yummy complimentary salad and bread with your meal.  Give it a try and hopefully you'll catch them on a good day!",

As a server for 15 years I would never treat any of my tables with the lack of respect that Sarah showed, they are paying your bills Sarah.

We have been there twice now and both times were the same.   Let's start with service.  This was the high point of the night.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive.   Now the food.  We started with a fried zucchini appetizer.  The zucchini was nicely done.  Crisp outside and dusted with cheese.  I did like this dish.   The salad sounded promising.  Greens, olives, cheese, onions, and sliced Genoa salami with a balsamic dressing.  Sounded good but it had no taste whatsoever.  They must have waved the vinegar over the dish and called it good.  The salad just had no taste.  Almost felt like I was eating mayo.   I ordered the baked rigatoni with sausage.  The menu  described it as being served with a garlic spiked red sauce.  This sounded good and our waiter said that it was a marinara sauce.  No creme.  There was nothing garlicky about the sauce.  I think they actually added butter to the dish.  Not even close to a red sauve and it was just blah. No taste again.  How can you advertise garlic spiked and have it taste like butter??  My wife ordered the pizza with some pasta on top of it with meatballs.  It was ok.  The meatballs had some taste to them (mostly salt) . The crust was nice.   I grew up speaking Italian and eating Italian food.  This ain't it ; not even close.  I am trying to figure out what people see in the food.  To each their own I guess.  Return factor is 10%",

Although we live in Gilbert, we try to come in as often as possible.  18 miles is a small sacrifice for their amazing salads, pasta and dessert. The food has always been amazing but the service is spectacular as well. Marissa is our favorite, always willing to go the extra mile for us. She knows her menu and is able to help with my food sensitivities. She remembers our orders, all modifications  included. Thank you!!!!",

It is precision chopped and  tossed with an excellent creamy balsamic vinegar  dressing (tastes like a great Italian) with plenty of salami, pepperoni, and ham slivers, olives, peppercini, tomatoes and fresh mozzerella cheese.  Served with small loves of fresh Italian Cibatta bread and Olive Oil and Oregano for dipping. These are UNLIMITED with an entree purchase.  I had meatballs and and pomodoro over linguini, and my girlfriend had creamy pesto and sausage over penne. Both were delicious with large portions and on an early bird special for $8.95, and $10.95 for dinner.  Great atmoshere too. Now my favorite Italian restaurant!",

Another server asked her table if they would like to try a sample wine, never got that question. It took him a while to get our check, we ordered cannolis and he hands us our check, took him a while to get back to us. He takes our check, looks at it, puts it in his apron and goes to the next table to take their order, he finally comes back with our check and cannoli 7-10 minutes later, after taking the check.

All of our entrees were delicious, my fettuccini Alfredo was deliciously rich and cheesy but not heavy, and my husband loved his Baked RigaTony with and marinara and Alfredo sauce together.  We passed on dessert, only cuz we were all too full, and the manager Jenny came to check on us before we left. Our waiter had told her we were first timers, so she wanted to make sure we enjoyed our experience.  We assured her we would be back; she further explained that this was her family's place and if we ever needed anything again to ask for her by name.

The tiramisu was such a disappointment what happened to the layers of ladyfinger and the delicate touches of coffee.  This reminds me of the time I tried watching Gigli.

The food is outstanding. The salad and bread that comes with your meal is the best part. We usually fill up on them because they are bottomless. The salad is always super fresh and tasty. We also tried the fried zucchini fries, which is one of the best things I have ever had. We both usually get the chicken with lemon and artichoke. The chicken is always juicy and moist. The service here is excellent, especially from Marisol. She is by far the best server there. Every time we go there, we ask for her. She is so friendly and welcoming.

I always switch back and forth between two favorites: spaghetti and meatballs or the baked rigatoni. I also really like the chicken marsala.  And if you ever have room, do yourself a favor and order the cappuccino pie. So delicious!",

The antipasti salad is a meal on its own! I had the Capallini Pescatore which was wonderfully prepared. The mussels and clams were very fresh and perfectly cooked. The tiramisu and cannolis were also perfect! Great service as well. Will always make this a must go stop when I'm in the area!",

I have used them for catering several times and have always had a positive experience, but my experience today motivated me to Yelp. A teammate called in an order for 14 people last night. I picked up the order and when I got to work, my teammate said we were missing food and utensils and had called to have it fixed,  so I had to go back. When I got back to the restaurant, the manager advised me that the order was correct, but because there was a miscommunication, she was going to make it right and provided me the food we \"thought\" we were missing (discovered it was indeed our fault, not RigaTony's). I really appreciate the staff going the extra mile to make it right! And lunch was wonderful!  Thank you!",

    "text": "RigaTony's has been a standby for me for as long as I can remember. I even went there for prom night, many years ago. I've been to both of the old locations, and more recently to the new one, and I've tried a good deal of their menu.  I find that the quality of their food is usually pretty damn spot-on. I've been disappointed with my food only once or twice; my normal favorites like the Chicken Picatta are absolutely fantastic and topped with a great mix of tomatoes and capers and such, and perfectly cooked and breaded. The Italian Sausage is fantastic, and the stuffed shells are great too, but the alfredo is usually a bit... tacky. The sauce is a bit thick in that it's usually lopped on top and doesn't mix well, though it's pretty tasty even after that.  There's enough special about this place to keep you coming back and enjoying yourself. Instead of the industrial strength, flavorless slabs of breaded sad-chicken I've found at other nearby Italian places, the overall quality is really enjoyable for \"mid-range\" Italian food.   The prices are fantastic: $16 or so for a \"Tour of RigaTony's\" that includes the picatta, sausage, shells, and alfredo is spot on, and easily two meals. The bread is incredible (ask for some scampi butter instead of the oil for a fun treat) and the salad and house dressing are REALLY good.   The service is hit-or-miss. I haven't been to the new location during any sort of dinner rush, just once a bit later where our server was just fine, but I've been disappointed by the service (especially at the old Brown location) so many times that I've taken to just taking out. RigaTony's travels well, and their carry-out deals include the salad, bread, and usually a dessert, including their tasty chocolate cake.  Not much of an oenophile or drinker in general, so I can't comment on the wine selection at all, but overall, you can have a tasty experience here with generally high quality food all around. Little improvements could make things a lot better, and I'll have to report back the next time I visit during dinner on the service, but I've been going for years and I love the place.  (Oh, one final thing: their lunch specials are INSANE. They vary from day to day, but you can be in and out in about a half hour for $7 with some GREAT food!)",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places of all times. When Rigatony's moved from Arizona Avenue, my husband and I thought we would go less. It was further away from our home and we were scared it would lose the charm and good food. It has been quite the opposite. We visit our favorite server Frankie at least once a week...and sometimes twice. We have been known to even show up three times a week, but that borders on addiction, so I hate to admit that. I would love to eat pasta three times a week, but cannot. We will order grilled chicken, steamed broccoli and the house salad. I will give credit to my best friend Robin who recommended that healthy alternative with the ability to still get our \"fix\". We have ordered party packages for gatherings at our house more times than I can count. Every dish I have ever had is incredible. Out of town guests??? We always bring them here. We take credit for creating a few addicts that insist on a visit when they are in town. Frankie sees us and asks if we are getting the usual and if we aren't then she can usually guess what the alternative is. CRAZY GREAT service. We love Christian who was once upon a time was \"only\"  behind the bar, but has taken on some managerial duties. The wine dinners are SO awesome and creative. Mike is always there to ensure our experience is awesome every time. Devoted diner cards have earned all kinds of discounts. They recognize us when we walk in, ask about our grand kids and are truly a family restaurant. Who could ask for more?",

The only reason it doesn't get all 5 stars is because of the incredible wait that we had the past 5ish times that we've went. It's usually always busy and we end up waiting no matter if it is a weekday or weekend.   My favorite is the choice of 1 or 2 lb. of clams on the appetizers, deeelicious! Too bad the shells count for most of the weight, but the lemony, oil sauce that it's swimming in really adds flavor. We've always had pretty slow service, not that they're not friendly, just kinda slow...I remember got sat (after a 30 min. wait), and waited another 20 min. before the waiter greeted us. The food made it up though. They have a wide variety of different pastas and seafood, but the clam linguini is sssoooo scrumptuous.  Love love love the bottomless salad. Much better than Olive Garden. lol  One time the waiter spilled all 3 large waters on our table and got us wet, but they cleaned it up right away and the manger came over, apologized, and said the appetizers were on them. Can you say.. awesome?   It always seems like a different story whenever we come here, not sure if that's a good or bad thing...",

The salad is good (very similar to the OG bottomless salad) with a mild creamy dressing.    The dinner portions are large.  I had the baked stuff shells, which were what you would expect.  Large shells full of creamy, herby ricotta goodness covered in marinara.  I passed on the baked Rigatoni which the place is famous for, I was told it was good, but it's not really my thing.  D had the veal cannellonni which he said was really good.  I was a bit suprised to see a full side of spaghetti on his plate with it.  J had the cheese ravioli covered with a mixture of the red and white sauces that come on the baked rigatoni - she declared it wonderful.  In fact the waiter who had never served it with that sauce combo said it looked so good he was going to try it out.  The wine was not good, tasted like it had gotten too hot - which I imagine is a common affliction for AZ wine drinkers.    We were stuffed by the time we left.  It's got a nice ambience, the waiters are really nice and for 3 people our bill was only $66 which in my opinion is a great deal.",

Their original scampi dish was the pinnacle of the genre. This new dish - think scallops cooked to varying levels of doneness, from burn to questionably undercooked. The shrimp joins this melody of scallops in a boat of liquid butter, not joined with the pasta in any form.  RigaTony's continues to have a huge following.  The lines are out the door. They have no reason to cheapen the dish.  Raise prices and keep the quality.",

Everything was AMAZING. The fried ravioli was my absolute favorite. When Marissa was taking our appetizer order, she asked if I wanted my 4 year old's food delivered at the same time as the appetizers, as opposed to having it brought out with the entrees. I've never been asked this before when dining! Ever! That totally made my experience perfect. She is just an awesome waitress. Our entrees took no time at all and were all delicious. I can't complain about any part of our experience, except that the bathroom changing table wasn't clean and was out of liners.

    "text": "I'd give 5 stars but there was just one thing I think should perhaps be reevaluated/changed for future parties/reservations. I wanted to celebrate my birthday here so I asked my boyfriend's mom to make reservations for my birthday. They said to her they wouldn't be able to reserve unless the whole party was there and seated. Now, I had a party of 14 people ( most of them elderly) so this seemed like quite an inconvenience. I understand the reasoning but I think for large parties, they have to be more accommodating (perhaps to judge on a case-by-case basis based on party size?). In the end, they managed to seat those who arrived early and reserved the rest of the table for the rest of the party to arrive, which was nice. The food here has always been amazing! Everyone tucked in happily into the salad, and even my boyfriend, who isn't a salad fan, loves it. The bits of salami (Pepperoni?) tossed in between the greens was delightful (it even tastes good when I had them for leftovers a day later)! The bread came, warm, and served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar--perfect to snack on before the main meal. I was a little hesitant to order a new dish to try because the last dish I had--the Capellini Pescatore--was amazing! I decided to go ahead and order the Shrimp Capellini and it was absolutely yums and did not disappoint at all! So happy I took a chance! My boyfriend's dad's dish was probably the one that was the least tasty. The Chicken Marsala was pretty juicy and tender, though the sauce was a tad sweet for his liking. The mashed potatoes didn't taste very good. Other than that, the dishes as a whole, seemed to please everyone. My dessert was the apple bread pudding with caramel sauce and ooooh this dessert is OUT OF THIS WORLD! It warms your tummy with its sweetness. I love it so much! My boyfriend is a big fan of the cannoli here as well. My guests, some of who'd never been to this place before, were very happy with the serving sizes and the taste of the food and said they'd definitely come back! The staff was very pleasant and efficient the whole time we were there. The food was served in a timely fashion. It's not overly loud or noisy so it's a good place to go on dates as well. The service and food here is always commendable. I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone looking for good food and good service and an all-around good time!",

Finally I said I'm calling you in good conscious that there's an issue with your food, and finally I told him I will know when I need to go see a doctor.  Talking to this guy was like being in a car accident, where he kept side stepping to admit any responsibility or even basic acknowledgement that the restaurant could make you ill within minutes of leaving.  The next day, I learned 2 more coworkers are ill, one who is ill with fever and throwing up.  I just called again to update Christain, and literally I quote him \"awesome, excellent.

I don't understand how this is justified, instead of offering a lower priced option that comes with a little less food. If you want to charge a split fee when you have an alternative on the menu, I can understand that. But forcing everyone to order their own entree or charge them extra is ridiculous, and even if I thought their food was better than average I would never go back to a place that has such a bad policy. Pretty sure it doesn't cost you more to prepare the dish whether I split it or not. Will not be returning.",

Every experience (about four or five) has been a complete nightmare. There service has been soooooo slow! I mean, 2.5 hours for two people to sit and eat Italian food is just not okay! And that is after you wait 30-45 minutes to sit down. The servers seem to lack experience and don't tend to your table very well...you can expect to be waiting for drink refills and wait and wait and then beg. I have even talked to managers there about their awful or lack of service and it was like they could care less what I was saying. I even emailed the Owner or Manager per the email address on the site about the worst restaurant experience in my life (and I dine out at least once a day) and I did not even get the courtesy of a response. A simple, I'm sorry to hear that happened to you would have been all I was looking for. I was so upset I have not eaten there since. I dont' care that their food is good; service is key, and treating your customers like they're disposable is not okay with me.

    "text": "The new and improved RigaTony's is open for business.   Located in the former Tres Margaritas location in South Tempe, the restaurant looks like it has been redone from top to bottom and feels more open.  There is a nice bar area and while not opened yet they are working on some outside seating just in time to enjoy the spring weather.  The food is main stream down home italian.  The place was busy and I asked the server and she mentioned since opening on April 1, they have had up to 2 hour waits. I am sure it will settle down but it would not hurt to call for a reservation for dinner.  I will definitely be surprising a friend with a trip here for lunch.  Overall a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",

Finally, I can have the fresh, filling pasta I have been craving without driving to Scottsdale, worrying about what I am wearing and having a heart attack when the bill rolls 'round. I had the linguini in clam sauce - the tomato sauce! I don't like the white clam sauce and can't ever find the red sauce - let alone one so perfectly spiced. The rest of my table thoroughly enjoyed their dishes as well - especially the baked pasta speciality, which my husband said he will get without meat next time because you don't need it. Why not five stars? Because it was crazy loud, the old booth ate my ass (I felt like I was sitting on the floor) and the waitress seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else. Thank goodness for the food!",

    "text": "I had lunch here with my buddies on Saturday afternoon and the service from our server was great.  We had ordered the clams for an appetizer it took a little bit to get to the table the sauce was great and clams were good.  One of my friends ordered the Raging Bull, my other friend ordered the tour of rigatony's and I got the veal picatta because I love good veal and usually get it at other italian restaurants.  The salad starter and bread that come out before our meals were good and we were hungry and excited for our main entrees.  As our meal came out, everything looked great so we started eating and the first couple bites of my dish were good the pasta wasn't overcooked the sauce was sweet and complemented the veal picatta.  After the first couple bites, my third bite was a really chewy piece of meat and didn't taste right and that is when I spit it out and looked at it in my dish and saw that it was raw!  I couldn't believe it so I showed my friends and they both agreed we should tell the server it was raw.  So we called her over and the first thing she said was \"Oh my!\" I apologize can I get you something else so I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs thinking after eating that I didn't want to run the risk again so I'll get something easy that should be an issue.  The manager on duty came by and asked me about it and she said have you had our veal before almost as if I had never eaten veal before.  So I replied I've eaten veal numerous occasions and have not had it here before so she said well a lot of customers love our veal.  I said that may be True and I liked the first couple bites until I got into the center and it was raw.  So she said she notified the chef and he knew about it.  She asked if I would give them another chance to get me the same thing and I said I had already ordered the spaghetti with meatballs since I didn't want to run the risk of getting raw veal again.  After that the server approached the table and I wanted to confirm I wasn't being overly picky and the server said \"Oh yeah it was raw and I apologize I think it was because they usually pound the meat to make it thinner and the middle part was thick and that's why it wasn't cooked thoroughly.  So I said no problem thank you for getting me the spaghetti and meatballs.  We asked for our check shortly after that and that is when I noticed that they didn't charge me for the veal but they charged me for the spaghetti and meatballs.  Now I'm not one that looks for free meals ever but if there was ever a chance for this place to make it up to me, it would have been on a simple spaghetti and meatballs dish especially when the manager challenged my taste in how the veal dish was cooked. I have to admit I was a little offended.  I eat out all the time and I've never ever had a manager say something like that to me.  My friends couldn't believe it and said that I could have gotten sick and which I agreed so we paid our check and left.  I've been here numerous times and never had any issues in fact I like the place and tell my friends to go here all the time but after this experience I will NOT be coming back.  I couldn't believe the nerve of this manager.  I think the server even understood because as we were leaving she said I think the manager wanted to talk to you.  After having her speak to me like that I did not want to hear from her again.",

At their old location it was so hard to park and in the middle of downtown Chandler which I personally hate driving through..so when when we found out they were moving we were pelased. In Danielle T's review she said it was a chain and it definitly is not..it is a family owned restuarant here in AZ. Anyways...they bring out Amazzzzzzzzing bread and salad to start! Just the way we like to start our meal :) I always get the Veal with Lemon and Artichokes which is just TO DIE FOR! I always want to venture out but can't ever manage to make myself do so. The husband always orders the Baked Rigatony w/Sausage and he loves it also! The house Chianti is also delicious according to the husband...I dont know though since I dont like red wine. I dont know how anyone could ever say this place is lower quality than Olive Garden? I really feel like she had no place or point of view to be writing that. Rigatony's is AWESOME and we will keep going back :) :)",

I typically get the pasta when i go there, but their angel hair pasta bowl is the best I have ever had. the sauce is deliciously flavored, though more a mix of Chunks of tomato and tomato sauce, while most places just serve up sauce. I'm not a huge fan of places that offer large pieces of tomatoes in places they don't belong, but they aren't heavily found so it doesn't really bother me here. I do know i have friends and family that go here and have been going here for years who order all kinds of dishes and they seem to always love it.

That being said, especially with the bread and salad served prior to the main dishes, you'll still end up with a full stomach + possible leftovers.   I've been to RigaTony's a handle of times and have never had an experience worthy of less than five stars. Food is incredible, as it's both fresh and flavorful. Any dish you get it customizable. Add a sauce, replace a sauce, replace the meat, anything. This is place is suitable for anyone looking to find pasta for vegetarians or those who are looking to have a meat-free meal.   Service is exceptional and the prices are fair. Definitely one of my favorite places in the entire valley.",

Service was great - we got a pound of the steamed clams - as fabulous as those in New Jersey where my husband grew up. We each got a baked hoagie - I got chicken and he got sausage - honestly, so large we could've split one. Such a pleasant, unexpected experience.",

I've been here many, many times and ordered a lot of their menu.  I have not been disappointed.  My favorites are their Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, Chicken scampi, and cheese ravioli.  They get very busy for dinner, especially on weekends.  Get a reservation or you'll be waiting an hour or more.",

    "text": "Location: Riga Tony is my favorite Italian restaurant in Arizona. It is located nearby Warner and 101 freeway with plenty of parking. The restaurant is very well decorated. Each table has different unique lamps hanging from the ceiling with lots of booths for a party of four as well as big tables for huge parties for families and friends.   Service: servers have excellent service and check up on tables very often. They constantly stop by to pick up dishes that were done and refill your drinks at your request. This place is extremely busy during lunch and dinner time up with up to an hour wait. I suggest you to call in few hours ahead to avoid the wait.   Food: I always get their 2 lbs garlic clam as an appetizer at every single visit. When you finish the clams, you still can enjoy it by dipping their delicious bread in the garlic clam sauce. If you aren't a friend of garlic or on a date, this dish is probably not for you. Their salad is absolutely tasty.   Rating: what more can I say? This is the BEST Italian restaurant in town!!!!",

The food is as good as ever but the service, atmosphere and price has changed, and not for the better. One of the perks of being a Diner Deluxe Member is that you can make reservations for party's of two. A couple nights ago we arrived at our reserved time a few minutes early. We were told it would be a \"few minutes\" before they could seat us. That is normal and fine with us. But our wait exceeded a half hour. Many parties of two that had no reservations were seated before us. When our \"turn\" finally happened there was no \"sorry for the wait\" or any indication there was a problem. It seemed we were more of a problem for them than a valuable customer. The price of food has gone up, it is too crowded for sure, and it has become a less than pleasant experience for us to dine there. It is unlikely we will return.",

All of these meals came with an antipasto salad and bread.  The food came came out in a pretty quick amount of time. Everything was good. The Eggplant Parm tastes a little bit off ... I think because it was slightly undercooked. The sauce it was covered in was pretty good, however. The Baked Rigattoni was kind of the same way - the garlic sauce with the chunky tomatoes tasted good but I was not impressed with the chicken. It was tasteless & could have been left off. Lastly, the Cheese Ravioli was good as was the tomato cream sauce, however it confused me as to why there was an additional cost associated with it.  As far as the restaurant itself - it is very much a family place & has that atmosphere. The decor is very outdated. I'm undecided as to whether or not I'll be back. It was good .. Just not exciting enough to go back. Not anytime soon anyway.",

Some of my favorite dishes are as followed in no particular order- fried ravioli, anything Alfredo, penne rosa with sausage, shrimp capellini, and although I don't eat them, my grandfather sears by their mussels and clams.  How much more Italian does it get than that? PS I no longer live in the east valley, and still drive 40 minutes when I'm able just for a meal. Lunch specials are also great ! Thanks RIgatony's!",

The wait seemed to be a factor of multiple large groups of prom-bound teenagers with reservations and separately, an obscene amount of takeout orders (mostly salads and some sort of sub sandwich?). Our 30 minute wait time ended up being 50 minutes, but we were hungry, and we were already so deep in, we continued to wait.   Immediately when the gentleman seating us brought us to our table, he stated they would like to give us a complimentary appetizer of our choice as a thank you for waiting (note, we did NOT complain about the wait time since it seemed like the restaurant was just having an unusually busy sort of night). We opted for the fried raviolis and were happy campers for the remainder of our dining experience.   We enjoyed the fried raviolis, complimentary bread and delicious (unlimited?) antipasto salad, a raspberry flavored Italian soda, a couple of beers, the Taste of Rigatony platter, and the deep dish lasagna with meat sauce. We also had the chocolate hazelnut cake to go.   Our server was busy but very friendly and attentive. The prices were impressive for the quality and portion size. Not sure if they take reservations for small parties, but it might be worth a shot next time we go (either way, there will definitely be a next time!).",

    "text": "First off, let me start by saying how pathetic and funny some of these negative reviews are. A vegan going to an italian restaurant? Are you kidding me?! Cheese and meat are just about the main ingredients in all italian food! Anywho, I hope everyone can see past those kinds of reviews.  The wife and I went in here on a late Sunday afternoon. Our server, I believe her name was Sophie, was phenomenal! Genuinely happy to serve us and extremely tentative. We ordered the house Chianti, RigaTony's plate, and manicotti. The wine was very good, the salad was one of the best salads I've had in a restaurant, the rigatoni was excellent and the manicotti was so delicious! We were treated to a free cannoli because I went on their website and entered my phone number.  We will be back!",

    "text": "We've been to RigaTony's more than a few times. Grandma C likes to switch it up sometimes so instead of going to O.G. we come here. On this visit there was a wait. It was a Sunday night around 6:30 and we ended up waiting about 15 minutes before being sat. It was really no problem because there were some supper nice people waiting as well. We just chatted it up until our buzzer went off. We ended up getting sat at the same middle table that we've been sat at 3 times before. It's kind of funny that we've been here 7 times but have only sat at 3 different tables.  This time our server was Tricia seemed a bit \"distracted\". Not a bad server but you could definitely tell there were a hundred places she would have rather been.  We enjoyed the pasta salad the comes with the meals. Actually, my favorite thing about RigaTony's.  C ordered Spaghetti with Meat Balls, Sub Rigatony ($13.95). Not sure how they came up with the price but I guess subbing Rigatony costs an additional $1.49. The pasta was cooked fine and C likes the sauce and meat balls just fine. Not sure the portion size was worth $13.95. Grandma C and K both ordered the Penne Rosa ($14.50 ea). Basically it's Penne with broccoli, peas, mushrooms & sausage in a tomato cream sauce, topped with asiago cheese. K liked the dish well enough. The pasta was cooked correctly. Her only comment was that the portion size did not warrant the price. Grandma C thought the dish was too spicy. I'm not sure if the spice was in the marinara or the sausage but either way she was less than happy with the dish. I ordered the Linguine with Clam Sauce ($14.95). I liked my dish. The pasta was cooked correctly. There were a lot of clams in the dish and the parmesan cream sauce was pretty tasty. Another thing that I was disappointed in was the bread. The slices are just too big and really doesn't have a flavor that's any better than your local grocery store variety. One last note. C ordered a Strawberry Lemonade. We got charged 50 cents for the Strawberry flavoring. I searched my pockets but there weren't any more nickels and dimes. Apathetic Service. Great Salad. Average Pasta. Good Linguine & Clams. Lousy Bread. Portion size not warranting Prices. Nickel & Dimed. 2.5 Stars.",

    "text": "Pretty consistent food every time. You get the salad and bread with your meal (meh). The service has always been great. I ordered the four cheese penne once and it came with a thin watery white sauce which was very disappointing. However, if you know what to order and what to avoid you can get great food. The baked rigatony is great although they used to offer the choice of chicken, sausage or broccoli. Now it comes automatically with sausage. I really like the spaghetti capone which is a very basic dish: butter, garlic, olive oil and anchovy. They make this well also. One more great option is quinoa or whole wheat pasta for those avoiding wheat. You can also sub the pasta for green beans, which I have done and with the delicious tomato sauce it's a more filling and nutritious option.",

We arrived about 10 minutes before our confirmed time only to be told that our party was moved to a regular table. The manager/owner was unapologetic and merely offered an appetizer for this mishap. What made this even more frustrating is the reservation was confirmed the day before. As much as we love the food, we won't be visiting this establishment again.",

    "text": "Rigatony's is an old standby for our family. We ate the Chandler location all the time when my mom worked in that area, and my husband and I ate at the Mesa location near our old house when we were first married. Now Rigatony's is only located in Tempe in what seems like an old Olive Garden. It's not a place that I would go to voluntarily, but it works really well for family dinners with relatives who have simpler tastes. Anything to avoid going to a chain restaurant!  My mom always gets the baked rigatony with sausage, their signature dish. I've had it with broccoli, but it's not quite the same. The cheese ravioli, however, is a good vegetarian dish (or you could add a meat sauce). It's homemade and had lots of ooey gooey cheese inside in addition to the creamy ricotta. Their marinara is good, and I like the chunks of tomatoes in it. My husband gets their gluten free quinoa pasta and is happy with it. My dad was very happy with the cappellini pescatore. He went through half a loaf of ciabatta to soak up the garlic sauce. The house chianti is a good value because you get a liter carafe which is an extra glass more than a standard bottle. Like the restaurant, the wine isn't a standout, but it does the job just fine.",

The baked rigatoni with sausage was amazing; just enough heat wth the sausage to make it a little spicy. My husband had the seafood linguine which was also top notch. The salad and bread were both incredibly fresh and added to the meal. Service was good and the wait time was reasonable. Overall, I'll be back every time I'm near Phoenix and I'll dream of the Alfredo sauce until I return!",

About a year ago my husband told me he wasn't a huge fan (which shocked me bc we'd been going for so long and he never complained) but then we went to Olive Garden for some event and he said that now he truly appreciates RagaTony's after tasting Olive Garden's food. Their house salad is awesome! We will buy bottles of their dressing when we leave (but it has to be consumed within a week bc there are no preservatives in it.) We will get the \"Tour of RigaTony's\" when we go. It has chicken piccata (that one is my favorite), lasagna, fettuccini, and some sort of sausage. For dessert I love their Cappuccino Pie (which is very rich and there's a lot of, so split it with someone or with a group!) or their bread pudding for the non-coffee fans.",

Every plate I've ordered is delicious and absolute authentic Italian meals. You immediately taste the difference and how truly special this place is at first bite. There is a few promos going on right now with purchasing gift cards. One is, if you purchase a $50 gift card, you receive a free Baked Rigatony for 2 people. I didn't realize however, that you may not use the gift card until 12/24. But because this restaurant is such a one of a kind eating establishing, I want my good friends to enjoy it right away and that meant sacrificing my freebie Baked Rigatony coupon. I politely asked in person if the free Baked Rigatony coupon could be switched to have the 12/24 date, but I was told no after asking politely in person. I'm not sure what the harm would be in asking to switch it, but it is what it is. And I could honesty say that this is the only down side to Rigatony's: they are so popular and ever so busy that they could do without with a loyal customer here and there. When I came in today in person, I wasn't able to actually speak to a manager. Seating hostess when to go find a manager and with a big smile on her face, she took off the 12/24 date off of the gift certificate and collected my Baked Rigatony for 2 coupon. I guess the answer was a \"No.\"  I don't feel the love after almost 20 years, but I'll be back! :-)",

I swear the current location used to house an Olive Garden-- I remember walking under the cobblestone arch distinctly...  Very happy to report that the antipasto salad is still terrific, perfectly dressed with an Italian vinaigrette made in-house! <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_z_LVSKnh9-PDgp1vmkQ5A&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Table bread, topped with a healthy dusting of cheesy/buttery herbs, was good, and the only thing that would've made it better is if it was served warm. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=fjEwFaXa88MNcFZpgQ_yJQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  I liked that server Alexis poured out the delicious olive oil for me.  I'd arrived between 4 and 5 pm, and that made me qualify to order from the Early bird special- the Pick-A-Pasta for $9.95.  Entrees come with antipasto salad and ciabatta.  Vacillated between ordering the fettuccine with meat sauce and meatballs, or the penne with Alfredo and chicken, until Alexis found out that the meat sauce contained celery (and possibly mushrooms, too), so it was the Alfredo, and it was heavenly! <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9yR-PxWayRqT9et2pLKj_Q&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Roux was perfect consistency and wasn't overly-salted.  The chicken was cooked well, too- not too tender and not too chewy.  Would order this again, but not until I try other pasta-bilities!  New-graduate Alexis was a delight to have as a server.  However, I did have to wait a long time for my check.  The restaurant was busy, with large parties filling up the room I was dining in.  Since I was distracted by messaging a few friends and relatives, I'd not noticed that from the time I'd had my fill and asked for boxes to-go and for the table check, to signing the check, 45 minutes went by!  I felt bad, because the long wait made me arrive a few minutes' late to meet friends at Mango Rabbit for boba tea...",

I love mom and pop style Italian food and this is the real deal. We got the fried hot peppers to start, and they served us delicious warm bread with dipping oils and salad while we waited do our entrees. Everything was so good and each ingredient added a lot of flavor.  I ordered the baked rigatoni based on a recommendation and it was so flavorful and delicious. My husband ordered the manicotti and said it was perfect. We didn't have room for dessert, but their cosmo and red wine blend paired well with everything.  We will be back - sooner than later!",

There's salami chunks in it. Like, I'd go back just for the salad. The bread is coated with some seasonings on top and it was served warm. It was so good.   My husband got the tour plate and he loved it. I got the baked rigatoni and it was BOMB. I also got a raspberry coconut Italian soda and it was so good!   I already want to go back here and as I'm writing this review, it makes me wanna go back nowwwwww!",

It was packed up so well, everything was exactly as we ordered it and it was so delicious and we fed 10 people and still had leftovers! I was very,very pleased.

    "text": "Prologue: My fiancee and I were considering where to dine out for date night and also in the mood to try something different in our immediate vicinity. Our online search yielded this result along with some good reviews.  The Plot: We started by sharing an order of the Fried Ravioli appetizer followed by the Chicken Cutlet Picatta and the Smoked Salmon Linguini entrees. We finished the meal with Cannoli for dessert, and then decided to try the Tiramisu as well.  The Scene: Their complementary salad bowl and bread deserve the good reviews they've received. There was plenty for the two of us with lots of salami along with other traditional ingredients that reminded me very much of the salad we had on our dining table at home when I was growing up.  I thoroughly enjoyed the ravioli appetizer, which was fried just enough to be crispy but not tough or chewy. The filling was still moist and the tomato cream sauce on top was light and flavorful but not too strong or acidic, and generous enough for there to be plenty left over for mopping up with some bread.  The non-breaded chicken cutlet was moist, tender, cut easily with a fork, and was topped with lots of mushrooms, tomatoes, and capers. I am very particular when it comes to pasta with sauce and I was completely satisfied all around with the Fettuccini Alfredo.  My fiancee also thoroughly enjoyed her linguini, a generous portion of pasta that was served with chunks of smoked salmon topped with a tomato-dill cream sauce and capers, which complimented the salmon very nicely. As with the fettucini, the consistency and flavor of the pasta and sauce were both very good.  The Rest of the Story: The restaurant had a nice, cozy feeling of home and the service was prompt and courteous.  Having grown up in an Italian household I've enjoyed my share of good cannolis. Therefore, I know it takes lots of practice to prepare them well. Never the less, I  was still optimistic about our order, one of which was made with a traditional ricotta filling and the other with a peach flavored filling. I must say that I did enjoy the traditional ricotta filling, however the shells were not quite up to par, most likely from having been prepared too far in advance of when they were served.  My fiancee is a fan of Tiramisu and so she wanted to try that as well. Although it was good, she was disappointed by the small portion size for the price. She also speculated that it was from Costco and, although I'm pretty sure that wasn't the case, I had to agree that it seemed to be commercially prepared rather than made from scratch on the premises.  Epilogue: It was an enjoyable meal and it was nice to be able to dine out so close to home.  Our review initially showed promise for being 4 stars, however we decided to downgrade it to 3 stars after having been a little disappointed by desert as well as the $70 tab for dinner for two, which consisted primarily of pasta, salad, and bread.

The hostesses were less than cordial and the waitress was not pleasant.  And these gals were young...they all just appeared miserable and definitely not enjoying having to work.  Salad was pathetic, filled a pasta bowl half way with some lettuce, about a half red onion, 2 pepperoncinis and 2 olives and a ton of dressing, for a table of 4 who we all have entrees, then basically threw some bread on the table and walked away.  Did not ask if we needed anything, Did not check if we needed oil or parmesan cheese or oregano.  Daughter ordered Pesto over campanelli with grilled chicken which did not look appetizing, it was over oiled and lost flavor, the chicken was sliced,over cooked/dry and they gave what appeared to be a half of a breast.  I ordered the special which was sausage, mushrooms, pappardelle, truffle oil and cream sauce.  The pasta was okay but the rest of it was poorly put together.  There sausage was crumbled and sparse, there was about 10 extremely thin slices of extremely small bella mushrooms.  Hubby ordered the tour which was just 4 different options slopped on a big plate. The sausage was surprisingly spicy but almost too much for an italian sausage blend, everything else was bland and he did not enjoy any of it.  Other daughter ordered smoked salmon pasta which she said was okay but not great.  We were greatly disappointed in the entire experience especially since we were celebrating my daughter's birthday.  We decided to skip any dessert at this establishment and go somewhere different.  We would not recommend this restaurant nor go back.",

We've never waited more then10 minutes to be seated and the service is top notch.  They have a loyalty program for regulars which we use and appreciate.  1 star deduction for a relative absence of healthier menu options (which I know is tough for Italian).  There always a fish plate and an option for whole wheat spaghetti but the single low carb menu option is only so-so.  All in all, RigaTony's is a winner.  Don't miss your chance for a restaurant meal that feels a lot like home.",

The salad was average, the bread was mediocre and the main course was overpriced and tasteless. My husband ordered Seafood Fettuccini and said that the fish was tasteless and the whole dish lacked flavor. Well, I tried it and compared to mine it was a bouquet of flavors! I ordered Capellini Pescatore described as \"clams, mussels and shrimp in white wine, lemon, butter, and garlic sauce\" and got this blob of angel hair swimming in broth like tasteless liquid with tasteless (have to use this word over and over again) mussels, clams and shrimp. Very disappointed! I don't know how you can possibly call any of that food \"outstanding\". Will definitely not be back! The only good thing about the place was the service - the waitress was very nice and quick. But if you actually wanna go have some good Italian food don't bother, it's awful.",

    "text": "By far one of my favorite Italian restaurants! The best thing to get here: Good old Spaghetti and meatballs! The sauce is sweet but robust, chunky, and just plain good! But the star of the show is the meatballs. They are soft, have great flavor but are somehow very light. Best meatballs I have ever had! Some other great entrees are the lasagna which is meaty and rich and the rigatoni with what else, the meatballs! Baked rigatoni with marinara and Alfredo and lots of meat of your choice. The best comfort food out there! Their Alfredo is pretty good as well. Years ago when I was in high school, I was obsessed with their lobster fusilli but they took it off the menu  :(  Why does that always happen to me? So anyways, I guess I am just hoping that someone from Rigatonys will see this review and decide to bring this dish back. Although... at this point, I love their spaghetti and meatballs so much that I don't know if I would order it. Haha. And of course, I cannot complete my review without mentioning their salad and bread. The salad is so above average. Mixed greens, cheese, olives, tomato, onion, and salami make for an amazing salad already but when the house Italian dressing is added, oh my god, out of this world. The bread is warm and I love dipping it in the olive oil with oregano and basil and maybe even a little balsamic. Lastly, their they have a very good tiramisu but I don't think I can ever order it knowing what their bread pudding is like. The bread pudding is one of the better ones I have had, and with bread pudding being my favorite dessert, I have to get it if I am going to have dessert. Rigatonys has a great flavor and the right amount of spice and the apples add a different texture to it. Its very good!  A few tips: You can actually buy their salad dressing and tiramisu just by going to the hostess stand. Also, Rigatonys used to be located at Knox and AZ Ave but the new location is much nicer and bigger.",

    "text": "This place is very cute and has a great vibe upon immediate arrival but is quickly lost to rude service and cheap ingredients! I had a very bad experience my first time here (late Sept) and thought that perhaps my snotty waitress swayed my palette to dislike the food. So, I decided to give it another try before I posted anything on FB or twitter. Well, the experience was NOT better! So bad in fact, it inspired me to re-visit yelp as well as hammer FB and twitter. I should begin by stating that I love Italian food and was inspired to deviate from my favorite 3 spots (1.Andreoli's 2.Harley's Bistro 3. Michelina's) because of the great reviews and an intriguing FB ad..big mistake! Where to start...their apps are pretty much bread or fried bar food. The sauce for the lasagna still tasted of tin from the can which it was poured from. Our sausage fettuccine alfredo was runny and bland. Basically, the ingredients in virtually everything we had tasted cheap and processed. There was nothing authentic or homemade about this place. FAIL!",

Then as our food was arriving the 3rd showed up and then as we ordered dessert the 4th showed up.  What a challenge and he was so easy going with our long extended dinner.  The new location is a bit loud as the room is quite large.  As always the bread is tasty if you order a side of alfredo sauce for dipping.  The salad is always so fresh and you can get it unlimited for your meal for $8.50 but it is always such a nice starter.  This was a first for ordering a latte and it was actually very good, I was pleasantly surprised.  And the dessert, yum!  3 out of the 4 of us loved it.  We will definitely go back for another girls dinner and ask for Christian-he was fabulous!!!",

    "text": "I tried this place on the recommendation of a co-worker, and I brought 3 family members.  The first contact with our waitress was her carrying 4 shots of the house wine, and after she found out that only two of us were over 21 years old, she poured the 4 drinks into two glasses and I enjoyed it immensely.  I even ordered a glass of it.  She either didn't hear me or she forgot, and the wine never arrived (oh, well).  We ordered an appetizer (baked ravioli), and the waitress brought us a large salad and we only ate half of it.  A short while later, our entrees arrive, and each one was awesome!  I could've enjoyed each one.  By this point, I'm so stuffed full, that I could only eat half my entree, and we all asked for boxes.  We ordered dessert, and even took half of that home!  I had already paid at this point, and we waited for an endless 15-20 minutes until the waitress noticed that we still needed her to bring us a box for the dessert.    And now, the big three:  Service:  Excellent.  Our server gave detailed answers on every question we had while we ordered.  She was attentive to refill our drinks, yet not to the point of being annoying.  Price:  Super expensive.  Most of the entrees were $10-15, so this can only be a family restaurant for special occasions.  They will easily miss the entire market of routine family meals, because of their high prices.  Taste:  Everything we tried was liked by all.    In the end, I will be going back, since both the food and atmosphere was excellent.  I'm ready to try something that we didn't try the first time.",

I don't know how they do it,but they were packed at lunch & I can certainly understand why! This is now our new favorite Italian place. You just can't get any better!

The high points are the fresh baked bread, the awesome iceberg lettuce, lunchmeat salad - think '70's italian salad, and it is really good!

From the waitress not using our \"devoted diner\" card because the last waitress made a mistake on the date.  Is that the customer's fault?  The way she informed us was not polite, she ignored our table until the check was ready and it was super awkward.  Then recently we were seated, ordered right away when she was taking drink orders.  However, we waited 15 mins for water and salad.  Then 30 mins for the food.  By the time it was 1:05 the food came out and we had to put in box right away to make our work meeting on time.  I understand they are busy, but when everyone around you were seated at the same time, already eat, paid their check, and we havent got our food???  Poor customer service, and maybe management really needs to make sure their waitresses pay attention to customers who sat around for a hour.  I will miss there food, but this isnt worth this treatment.",

The bread was very fresh  & moist; dinner comes with an antipasto salad, which was exceptionally tasty.  Hubby had seafood linguini (shrimp & scallops) in pesto sauce; he loved it.  I had chicken parm with spaghett.  Very good.  We splurged for dessert today - apple bread pudding and spumoni.  Our bill was $64 + tip, which we felt was very reasonable.  It was a lovely dinner and we hope to return once again before going home.  As mentioned, Tyler helped make our dinner extremely enjoyable and memorable.",

I was not disappointed. The wait was a bit long, but it was definitely worth it. Sophie, our waitress was super friendly and very efficient. We loved the service she provided for us. Both our entrees were good, and we loved it. Will definitely recommend this restaurant to other friends and colleagues.",

    "text": "Parking: Parking is great super easy.  Intro to Walking In: You walk in a prepare to be seated. You'll feel the ambiance of an Italian restaurant when you are seated.  The Food:  Monday special Chicken Parm and to Spice up things with more meat I added a meat ball. For starters, I was introduced with a salad and it appears to have some type of sliced meat in it. Not impressed with the salad, definitely not fresh and it doesn't take a whole lot of time to rip apart lettuce to make a great tasting fresh salad. The shredded cheese did not taste fresh for the day, must be of been pre-shredded in a bag thrown in with the salad that was made a day or two ago. Thumbs down on the salad. Fresh bread comes out with added olive oil to the plate for dipping, it was good nothing bad about it. Next, the lunch comes out. I immediately dive into the Spaghetti with an amazing sauce. The sauce is excellent and above average. I then cut into the meat ball and I notice the small pieces of diced onions and can't wait to devour it. I took a bite and can only guess that maybe these meatballs were made yesterday and warmed up today due to the mild coldness of it. I would give you a 5 on the meatballs because of the packed flavor, if they had made fresh to order or at least fairly hot for the lunch plate. I cut into pieces and mix into the spaghetti which topped it off very well. On to the Chicken Parm, I cut into the parm and it looks possibly fresh. I bite into it enjoying the same great flavor of the sauce from the spaghetti and the very fresh cheese thinking not too bad. However, I get into the chicken itself and it seems very bland and not as crisp as I would enjoy it to be. It almost seems as if it was a frozen Chicken Parm. It could have been the seasoning was not flavorful as well.   The Waiter/Service Experience:  Waiter very attentitive during lunch time rush hour. Brought my drinks in time and advise the manager of the Chicken Parm. I asked him if it was frozen and not made fresh to order, he said made fresh to his knowledge. I let him know it tasted as it was frozen and that it was very bland but not to take anything off my bill. I was offered to have another one remade and I took the offer. The one to go did taste better than the first one for sure. Now, as a manager you should always greet yourself and make that offer. However, because it was offered I give you kudos for it and to the waiter for even bringing it up.   Overall Experience and Why not a 5: The Salad was definitely not something to come back to and the Chicken Parm should come out like that all the time. The meatballs should come out pretty hot not warm/cold. The service, was great and the ambiance is great. I could not come back with a group of people to have them tell me the salad was awful, especially if it's for starters. Fix these minor issues and you'll have great customers coming back for more and more. Otherwise, you're below average and going to Olive Garden is not such a bad thing.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Rigatony's.  The restaurant is easy to find and has ample parking. The inside is quite homey and warm. We were seated at a table that was sectioned off by a large tapestry/curtain. Each time people walked by, the tapestry would hit us. The room also echoed terribly, with the most obnoxious voices towering over us like someone gave them a microphone. I honestly don't remember the name of our server (a blonde girl, that doesn't help. Lol) , but she was abrupt and pushy with a fake smile. She brought our menus and was very pushy for us to order. She kept rolling her eyes at us and was obviously aggravated that we were taking our time. I got one water refill during the appetizer, and never again. We asked beforehand to split the bill. With only 4 of us (2 couples), it was silly of me to think that two bills would be an issue. Our friends split the Tour of Rigatony's, which they love and said was fantastic. They also upsold the bread and antipasto. I didn't think either was special. Our antipasto didn't even have any meat, and had one pepperoncini. My husband ordered the shrimp scampi and thought it was great. I ordered Shrimp Cappellini, but asked to substitute the haricot vert for the pasta. I didn't get it. Since she dropped it and never came back, I ate the shrimp and nothing else. Aggravated. My food was boxed for me while I was in the restroom, and our party ordered dessert. The spumoni was ok. The pistachio cannoli was amazing. The cream was ridiculously good. I would try this place again, but would run from the waitress. I wish I remembered her name so I could warn everyone.",

The waiter was nice but called the salad anti- pasti salad. Oh, you mean antipasto!   I knew we were in trouble when I asked how the eggplant was- the waiter said it's great and as a matter of fact, a customer earlier today said it was better than The Olive Garden. It was ok, a bit salty though  My husband had the combo plate with sausage, fettuccini Alfredo, manicotti and chicken piccata- thinking we'd try few things and something was bound to be good. Well, the sausage was ok but the rest almost inedible  Yes I'm an Italian snob for context.   If you like Olive Garden, you may just like this place. Sorry RigaTony's just being honest",

Whitney never let our water glasses get empty nor get upset when we constantly asked for more bread, salad or dressings. My friend and I sat outside and made the experience 10X's better with all their beautiful decor. I highly recommend going to this restaurant! This was my first time there and I am defiantly will be going back! I love it! We went there around 5 pm for dinner on a Sunday and there was no wait! and it was pretty packed",

    "text": "I asked what was in the anti-pasta salad in the soup & salad. Was told lettuce, black olives, parmesan, pepperoncinis - so I ordered it with the potato/cheesy soup. Was asked if I wanted them brought together or one then the other. I said both at the same time. They forgot the soup. I figured it was coming shortly so I waited and then finally ate the salad, slowly with my few friends. It had ZERO parmesan - what makes the salad worth eating. It had mozzarella - big bland deal. Two measly black olives and it was mostly lettuce with just a sprinkle of the other on top. The dressing was disgusting (no choice) so I ate it plain - okay as I often have it plain, except when I eat it plain, it has parmesan, which takes it from bland to tasty. The mediocre salad was finished and I waited and waited. Finally, I got up and went and told them that they forgot about my soup. Was asked what kind - then I got it, after more waiting. The service was dreadfully slow. The soup was bland, and they brought more salad but I didn't have room for much more - I wanted the soup, and I wanted it first - too late for that. I asked for butter for the bread. It was too hard to spread - kept falling off the bread so I gave up and had the oil for dipping. One dip and that's it. They expected all 8 of us to share two saucers for dipping. Do you double dip? How about with a sick person? One of the group kept hacking away - was ill. Had to get up again and go and ask for individual saucers for dipping so that we did not have to double dip with the whole group. Never did the server ever come back and ask if everything was okay. TERRIBLE SERVICE & the server ought to have been accurate and knowledgeable about the menu and she was not. Mediocre food at best. No, I will NOT return. A friend ordered a pasta dish. In the bowl, it looked like just a heap of pasta, no veggies, nothing but a barely detectable smooth sauce. My impression: They make the dishes as cheaply as possible to derive as much profit as they can. There are so many places around that provide much better food, much better value and much better service.",

    "text": "Phoenix has been my home away from home lately since my boyfriend comes for Air Force drill every month so I've decided to go on a bit of a Yelp search for the best places near by. We had a craving for some great Italian pasta so we decided to check this place out after seeing all the great reviews.  The service was great. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the meal. She also gave us some punch cards at the end of meal to use for return visits.   I loved the atmosphere. It seemed kind of similar to a Boca's with the decorations but more of a family owned feel.  To save the best for last, the food was amazing! We had the calamari to start which came with a classic & spicy marinara as well as some lemons. I thought it was very good and portion size was very generous. My boyfriend had the make your own pasta special which came with an antipasti salad and rosemary bread. (Available daily 2-5 pm) We ended up sharing the salad and bread since the portion size was huge. I went with the Baked Rigatony and omg, delicious!!   I can't get enough of this place and I'll definitely be back soon!",

    "text": "Please keep in mind I like this place.  I like it enough to want to spend a LOT of money here for a special treat for my staff.  I will not likely eat here again.  Here is a letter I wrote to the management: ========================================== Today I attempted to obtain a reservation for next Tuesday. We have a party of 16 who will be looking to celebrate the end of the tax filing season.   I was informed that it is against policy to take a reservation of that size, opting instead to ensure you have room for walk-ins.   I have no doubt that your restaurant is successful and that things are going well. However, I find it strange that any company would turn away guaranteed revenue in favor of the unknown on an evening in the middle of the week. Perhaps if it were the weekend, I would understand, but on a Tuesday?   When my staff called two weeks ago attempting to schedule, they were given the same answers I was this morning. I simply could not believe it, so I had to call myself. They were given the answer of \"we need to make sure we have enough staff on the floor.\" I would expect that, if scheduled in advance, you would be able to plan for your staffing. I would also assume that a previously unscheduled staff member would be happy to come in for a two hour shift in exchange for a guaranteed tip of over $150 (at 20%).   I look to Rigatony's as a great neighborhood restaurant that would be outstanding to plan a special occasion such as ours. Apparently I was incorrect, unless the party is 12 or less people.   I wish you best of luck in the future.",

    "text": "I forgot how disappointing this local chain is. I won't make this mistake again.  We went on a busy Friday night, when the restaurant was packed. Parking was more plentiful than either of the old locations, but that was probably the last plus of the evening. (Well, not quite -- the bathroom was clean.)  The restaurant is poorly laid out and VERY loud. Every seat was full, making it nearly impossible to hear my boyfriend two feet away. Sitting at a table next to the main pathway along the large dining room wasn't much different from sitting on the edge of the food court in Grand Central Station. If you want to get hit in the back of the head by a half-dozen knock-off purses, this is the place to go. Our waitress was impossible to hear, but she managed to catch our orders. She didn't look us in the eye the whole evening. Her annoyance at this job was absolutely clear, and I don't blame her. The place has a miserable ambiance. I'd hide in the kitchen too.  The salad was fine, though it would have been nice had the waitress had let me speak (to say I wanted to remove the onions) before she started tossing it. The bread was good.  I ordered the Capellini Checca, which was absolutely shameful. This restaurant has decided to take the \"cutting corners because we don't care\" route that Chef Ramsey sees so often. There was about a cup of water in the bottom of the large bowl of angel hair, and the advertised \"fresh roma tomatoes\" were actually canned but chopped whole tomatoes. (It's June -- tomatoes are in season, for goodness sake.) It was a flavorless mess of powered garlic, a shard or two of basil, overcooked store pasta, water, and \"tomatoes\".  You'll be far happier at Olive Garden.",

I went there last night with a party of 4 at about 7pm.  I have no idea why the place was jam-packed at 7 on a random Tuesday, but good for them.  It took at least 15 minutes to get a table.  Our server was pretty good though I thought he was a little overly friendly and kinda fake.  But all our food came out correctly and my diet coke was refilled in a timely manner.  Good stuff.  Here is my rundown:  * House Chianti = no bueno (but I like it that they bring the whole table a taste of it in little shot glass things right when you sit down...a very nice touch) * Bread = very good.  big fluffy pieces with great crust. * Alfredo dip appetizer thing = eh.  Not much flavor and you can feel yourself gaining weight and your arteries clogging. * House Salad = excellent.  your table gets a nice big bowl of this stuff.  it is very very good.  lots of great ingredients and an excellent dressing. * Lasagna = excellent.  full of meaty, cheesy, saucy goodness * Meatballs = not a fan.  the sauce is ok, but the meatballs are made with a bunch of other non-meat stuff.  tasted bready...  I will not rush back but would come back to try some of their other stuff.  It all seems pretty standard for an Italian place though.",

We've had Christmas Eve dinners, birthday's, and many family visits to the older Chandler and the newer Tempe locations. Much to my chagrin, the last visit 5 nights ago was very disappointing.  With relatives in from back East, we all decided on Italian and Rigatony's. Poor food and poor service. Salad was drenched with dressing. Chicken Marsala was tremendously sweet.  A different brand of Marsala wine is needed.  One of us could not finish it was sooo sweet.  Chicken over cooked and dry. Chicken with artichokes and lemons... Luckily I had a lemon from my water, as there was no lemon flavoring and just a few pieces of artichoke.  A single piece of chicken that was over cooked and dry. No sauce at all. Chicken Parm... dried up and over cooked chicken. Fettuccine Alfredo was like glue...  Had to ask for water 2X and then only 2 waters delivered for a party of 5. Had to ask for an extra plate for the olive oil dip for the bread. Had to prepare the olive oil dip ourselves...  Probably wont go back after 14 years.... Disappointing... The bread was great!!",

Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!  I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.    This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.  I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for.",

I thought maybe they don't have change because they just opened.  After waiting a long while another  woman appears who I now assume is the trainee and begins ringing my order on the register I have dug through my purse for correct change.

I brought in the first woman to my conversation with the trainee  it was two $20 bills (I just came from the atm) and suggested to look at your bank as I was probably the first cash customer. She insisted it was a &20 and a $10 bill She said they would do the bank in the evening and call if $10 over.  If u r going to train someone then supervise.

This was my first time here so once we were lead in I realized the place was huge, much like the inside of a Bucco di Beppo but much more open.   We were seated at a booth and our server Jared was with us shortly. We soon received our antipasto salad and ciabatta bread, both of which were very different than the norm, but very good. They have a large selection of entrees and I finally settled on the chicken fettuccine. In hindsight, I wish I would have gotten something with red sauce as I think I might have been more \"wowed\". My dish was good, but it was a pretty standard chicken alfredo. Everyone else enjoyed their dishes and even though they were really busy, service was never an issue.   This is definitely somewhere I'd try again, especially before ever going back to a Bucco di Beppo.",

The service was so bad that she didn't even take drink orders... we had to flag her down to get them.  The Filet and Shrimp...  For $18.50 you expect a nice steak and some shrimp... She got 2 wafer thin cardboard cutouts of steak and 4 shrimp.  The shrimp weren't bad, but the steak was horrible.  They replaced the steak with a piece of grilled chicken (cut up).  Our other friend got Spaghetti...She rated it as worse than High School cafeteria food.  At least in High School you know what you're going to get.  She said that the pasta was mush.  I got the Baked RigaTony...normally very good... it was very wet and half of the noodles were soggy and the other half were \"ok\".   My wife's was the same.  The server did try to argue with us about the meal, but we asked for a manager.

Had to ask different staff for water refills and soda refills.  Had to ask the bartender for a to go cup for the soda.",

There were so much foods for lunch we had leftover for tomorrow.  I enjoyed my cheesecake italian cream soda from one review of the review.   I rarely gave 5 stars... yummy in my tummy!",

For $10, I had a good sized dish of pasta, salad (enough for two good sized plates if I wanted it), bread, and a soda. It's tough to beat a deal like that for the amount of food I got.  I showed up right around noon and they were pretty busy with a lunch rush, so I would recommend going a bit earlier or a bit later to try to avoid that rush.  Overall...good food, great price.

I got the stuffed parmesan shells - YUM! They filled me up and left me wanting more. I tried my date's chicken alfredo pasta and almost wished I'd had that too. Seems like you can't go wrong with what you order here. Plus the house salad and bread added a great touch.   The ambiance and restaurant itself was clean, bright, and smartly decorated.

    "text": "Went to RigaTony's a few nights ago with the fiance after receiving a $50 gift card for Christmas. It was very busy around 6:45pm and the wait was going to be about 20 minutes. We saw that there were a few booths in the bar area and asked the hostess if these happened to be open seating. To our surprise, they were! It was actually very cozy in the bar area and had a very romantic feel to it.   The booths in the bar area were perfect for two and we were greeted right away. We asked our waitress a recommendation on wine and she suggested the Moscato. My fiance decided to have a glass of this and I decided to try the sangria flight which included, apple, basil and berry. The Italian Moscato that my fiance had was amazing and had just the right amount of sweet to it. The sangria flight was just okay. I would not get it again. the apple was the best by far but the basil one was kind of odd and the berry was way too sweet. We decided on our order and he got the baked lasagna and I got the baked Rigatony, which consisted of Italian sausage with marina and alfredo sauce baked on top of penne pasta. Both of our meals were delicious. We were also served a great Italian salad before the meal which was served with an Italian vinaigrette and pieces of salami on top. It was delicious and I was impressed that this came with our meals.   To top it all off we finished with a bowl of spumoni. It was delicious and the pistachio was my favorite. Service was fantastic, even in the bar area. She made sure we always had everything we needed and brought us a loyalty card at the end of meal and if you come in 6 times, you get your 7th meal free. Overall our visit here was great. We will be back.",

I ordered the chicken parm with rigatoni pasta (and marinara) and my boyfriend got the short ribs.  He thought his portion was fairly small but said it tasted alright.  I thought my dish was a good portion for the price.  But it was just \"ok\".  But I will say the dinner bread was really yummy and the salad before the meal was pretty good as well.  Their house vinaigrette was tasty, much better than their house pesto ranch. My boyfriend had the apple bread pudding for desert and he said it was pretty good.  You definitely know you are at an Italian restaurant by the decor.  We felt like we were at Grandma's for dinner, which is a comforting feeling but it is definitely outdated to say the least.  We were a bit confused at the items/food for sale at the front, where the hostess is at.  Strange that you could buy some Quest bars, a pizza cutter and some soda, I guess it's your next best option if you don't want to go to the grocery store.  With all the options of restaurants around here, most likely we will not go back.",

We also tried the tiramisu which was like a big pudding square that melted in our mouths also. It was so delicious, I wanted to get another one but we got really full.

The taste of food has always been great, but today my girlfriend and I experienced a very small inconvient situation and it was that the bread that rigatony serves before every meal was delayed due to the restaurant being very busy.  The restaurant manager Todd came over to our table to notify what was going on and was extremely apologetic, polite and professional. For him to come over as the manager himself when the restaurant was busy, just tells me and my girlfriend how important and serious customer service is at rigatony's. I have always loved this place telling all my friends about it telling them its a 4-4.5 star restaurant, but after today's experience it's most definitely deserves a 5. Food can always taste good, but having great customer service can always help the food taste that much better. Thanks again Todd for this great experience today!",

Frankey, our server, was friendly and attentive. I had \"the tour\" which is a little of all their favorite dishes and it was great!! Could easily be two meals. Dinners come with family style salad and bread so you don't need an appetizer but if you want one, the calamari was great!",

    "text": "My favorite restaurant in Arizona.  Whenever referring this to friends, I tell them it's the price of Olive Garden but so much better.  When getting an entree, you get free bread and salad.  The bread is pretty average for an Italian place, but the salad is what keeps me addicted to the place.  It comes with a great house dressing, and the small strips of salami make it unreal.  I try to fill up on this as much as possible (all you can eat) and have a little of my entree and bring the rest of the entree home as leftovers.  Entree-wise, the Baked Rigatony is our go-to dish if nothing else is really standing out; sometimes it comes a little low on sauce so asking for extra sauce is a good precaution.  Haven't ever been disappointed with entrees.  Make sure to make reservations if you're going sometime between 5:30-7:30, especially on weekends.  The hosts provide good service.  My only knocks on the place are hit-or-miss on good service from servers, and that the place is usually very loud.  But the food and price makes up for it.  The prices over the last few years have come up $2 or so per entree; as long as they don't skyrocket, I'll be coming to this place for a long time.",

    "text": "We were in the market for some good old fashioned Italian so we made the trek to Rigatony's based on it's shining Yelp reviews. The little taster of house chianti they offered right after we were seated put us off to a good start. The salad was delicious (I'm a sucker for a salad with red onions and pepperoncini, bonus points for salami!). The bread was also a tasty starter dipped in oil with some spices (oregano & rosemary, I think), so we skipped any additional appetizers. My husband ordered the linguini and clams (he asked for it to be prepared with a lemon garlic style sauce instead of the menu offerings of Parmesan cream or tomato sauce and the waitress immediately recognized his request as \"traditional style\" and said it was no problem), I ordered the shrimp scampi. My dish was perfect, the shrimp and angel hair pasta were cooked to perfection and delicious! My husband enjoyed his dish but was not bowled over by the actual clams in the dish (possibly they were canned, not fresh?). That is pretty much the only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review. The cannoli was amazing and I love that they include 2 so I didn't have to battle my husband for my fair share. The price was also really good, compared to the other Italian restaurants, I think we'll definitely be back.",

The new location is much more updated and I love how they still manage to have the same sense of authenticity. This is my families favorite Italian restaurant in the valley- and that says a lot because we are all Italian immigrants and can sometimes be critical about certain traditional dishes.The only thing I've noticed is the dessert could use more variety. However, I love the price point- especially their lunch specials, that is the best deal.  When it comes to service, I overall don't have many complaints. My most recent visit I had a server named Erykka and she was very friendly and I could tell she was knowledgeable about the menu. My drink was never empty and I appreciate her for recommending a new dish to me because I rarely stray away from their classic \"Baked Rigatony (with sausage)\".  I always recommend Rigatony's to anyone visiting or living in Arizona and will continue to do so, keep up the great work!",

The noodles are store bought, the ravioli is clearly frozen, the salad appears to be bagged, and it's apparent that the sauces aren't even made in house. I really want to like this place, but I feel the quality has diminished drastically over the years. There doesn't appear to be anything \"authentic\" about the food here. Save yourself some money and just go to the store and buy jar sauce and packaged noodles. It's the same thing, minus the hour long wait for a table.",

Sure the starting salad with oven-fresh bread was plentiful, the entrees were classic, flavorful, and filling, the wine selection was concise and appropriate, the Italian sodas were exciting and invigorating, and the staff was friendly and accommodating. RigaTony's certainly had all of those things, but from the moment you enter their front door you feel like you entered a different world. I'm going to admit, after seeing the store from the outside I was extremely skeptical; it kinda looked like a Denny's or IHOP. But when I walked through their front doors, I was greeted by an unsuspecting air of homeliness and familiarity. It made you feel like you were walking into their dining room for a home-cooked family meal. From the smell of the kitchen to the buzzing chatter of the guests, it just felt so comfortable. 5-stars well deserved.",

After all that hype, I was ready to lay the hammer down--- they laid the hammer on me... I'am hooked for life. Wow! these folks just serve great homemade style cooking, fresh, hot, large servings and our drink glasses never made it 1/2 before our friendly waitress was on it.   Oh!! did I mention there was about 18-20 of us in the group hmmm,  and they never missed a beat.  These folks know how to serve you and serve you quiclky, I was also, shocked at how much food was heading out the front door.  They do catering too.  Great stuff,  Everyone knows I can cook and I love to out do the local resturants but me and my buddies agreeed leave the Itailian cooking to RigaTony's when you can just go there eat and be merry.

They start you off with some huge family size salad which is to die for. The portion size is enough for a couple to share, or just bring the other home for lunch the next day. I am all about this place , don't fill up on bread and salad !   Try the tour or the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken ! Both amazing !!!!!",

I was so impressed with the process happening at the front end, so many carry out orders, people who had made reservations, people just walking in, it could have been chaos but it wasn't.  The wait was so worthwhile because the food was fantastic!  I tried the sangria flight-3 full glasses of delicious sangria.  The antipasto salad was absolutely to die for and was such a large helping for 3 of us.  My husband had fettuccine Alfredo, my son had lasagna and I had baked manicotti-delish!

    "text": "By far my most favorite Italian restaurant. They start you off with a huge salad and focaccia bread and their portions are very generous for their entrees. However, the last time I was there I decided I'd try the roast beef sub and I was deeply disappointed. It was so full of gristle that I couldn't even eat it. I didn't send it back but I should have. That is one time out of 30 that I have been disappointed with a dinner there. Their lunch specials are always great",

The salad that was served before the meal was exceptionally good, and the olives topped it off really well. The rigatoni was sooooo fresh, and all of the seasoning and the cheeses flowed very well together, so far the best I have had with the noodles cooked to perfection. Will definitely come back to have some very good Italian food!",

I came in for their free federal employee lunch. The government shutdown is scary and difficult for most of us federal employees. This generous offer of a delicious meal on the house is a wonderfully kind gesture and greatly appreciated. Everyone was nice and didn't make us feel awkward about receiving the free lunch. The manager came over at the end of our lunch and thanked us for our service to the American people; this was a very nice gesture and brought a little light into an otherwise dark time.  I can't say thank you enough to RigaTony's and I will be a regular customer when the government opens back up.",

Terrorism is the spiciest meatball there is.\"  Mario Batali  RigaTony's:  Your Italian sweetheart since 1994.  Their antipasto salad and house ciabatta are pretty delicious.  Wash it down with some Italian sodas [$2.50 each] and it's bliss.  I'm glad these were are offered right away because it was a busy Friday and it took a while before our food came out.  I was hungry and their salad and ciabatta bread tasted great.  We ordered the Tour of RigaTony's [$18.50 - Chicken picatta, baked manicotti, grilled Italian sausage, and fettucine alfredo] and a Fettucino Alfredo [$14.25].  We also ordered some Pistachio Cannoli [$5.50 for two] to go.  A big bowl of fettuccine alfredo might not be the most exciting dish but all I really need in life are some noodles and some fattening cream sauce. The portion was huge. I ate about half in the restaurant and the other half of as my midnight snack. The Tour of RigaTony was also pretty good. The favorite bite on that plate was the manicotti. As for the pistachio cannoli, I wouldn't know what to say. I didn't even get a bite before they were both devoured! Some people are just so rude! I guess they were just that good.  All in all, RigaTony's is an excellent place for some good Italian eats.",

Salad and bread came quick, which was good although the salad was overwhelming from too much sauce.   Fried calamari, which was an appetizer, came nearly 20 minutes later despite the waitress telling us countless times that it would be out in a second. When it did come, it was soggy and honestly, didn't taste fresh. 1/5  We waited another 20 minutes but our lunch specials did not arrive. Mind you we order simple pasta, nothing that needed to be baked or whatnot. Food came about 45 minutes after our arrival/order, and it looked miserable. My girl's pasta had literally 1 meat ball inside, and you could count the number of pasta on my Alfredo fettuccini.   Lunch special portion wise: 1/5 Taste wise: 1/5 - honestly go to a grocery store and buy the pre-made sauces, its way better than this. Service: 2/5 - although the waitress was polite, she never offered any reasoning as to why the food took so long and seemed nonchalant about it.  Save yourself and just hit up Oregano's instead fam",

    "text": "Attended a family birthday party here. First, I noticed that it looked clean and environment felt good. Turning to the food and service. The salad was a bit soggy.  The bread was good a bit hard on the edges. Our main dishes was good. I ordered the lemon chicken with alfredo. The chicken was flavorful, tasty and tender. Alfredo was good. Our server wasn't so friendly, he was rude and very impatient. The server totally didn't take my son's order. The server never came around to be notified, we were able to get his attention when the other food came out. We had young children ages 7-10, the server was rude and impatient to them when asked what they want to drink and when he came back around to pick up their used plates. Lastly, my water was never re-filled. :( And during these temps, water goes fast..... We shared our unhappiness with the manager, they didn't charge for the missed order and brought a few desserts to our table to make attempt to make up for this. A special birthday dinner, wasn't so special at RigaTony's. :(",

The service from Jenna and the manager were perfect! We started with the antipasto salad, which had the perfect amount of dressing and the flavors were fresh. We had the clams (brought in fresh daily) in the white wine sauce, which was AMAZING and it will be something we order EVERY TIME we go back. We had the Sicilian pizza for two which had a great balance between the sauce and the meat and a perfectly crisp crust. We finished off with an order of cannolis. The strawberry cheese cake filled cannoli was the perfect ending to our night. We will definitely be coming back soon!",

    "text": "Coming here for dinner without reserverations is not a good idea.  We waited 1.5 hours to be seated in a very crowed front entrance with limited seating. This can and was irritating. Finally after waiting we were seated in a large dinning room. We were seated right next to a doorway where there were 5 other tables.  Every time a waitress went to another table she bumped into my chair and I was nervous when she carried a tray right over my head that she would drop it on me.  We were waited on by Abby who was fabulous!  She took the time to explain the menu to us and checked on us regularly.   The food was okay, not the best I had in the Phoenix but not the worst either.  The portions are big, but to me the sauce was not balanced.  It was sweet but you could still taste the bitterness of the tomato paste.  Maybe they need my old boyfriend's grandmother's recipe from Sicily which takes me 6.5 hours to cook and is the best tomato sauce I ever tasted.  Anyway, would I come back,  I don't think so .  There are too many restaurants in the valley who have a better atmosphere and better menus.  Do they cost more? Yes, but when I want good food it's worth to pay a little more.",

We had reservations for 9 ppl tonight for a 60th birthday party a guest of ours brought their 2 younger grand daughters (7&8) & they said we changed our reservation & would have to wait an additional hour and a half we said they wouldn't take much room & could even sit on someone's lap they didn't care & turned us away & told us we had to wait due to the reservation change. The guests then offered to leave because they didn't want to ruin the birthday but they shouldn't have had to do that we said we were leaving & would never return & they didn't bat an eye and said 1 HR & a half to meet our additional needs. so we went to Olive Garden who had no problem accommodating our party!

You see, RigaTony's serves up some hearty, meaty, thick lasagna... but the sauce is toooooo sweeeeet.  My friend and I thought the same thing.  Unfortunately, we both liked the restaurant but are not fans of sweet tomato sauce, instead preferring a garlicy, spicy sauce.    That being said, if you are a fan of food on the sweeter side (which obviously many are since it was nicely packed)... I'd recommend RigaTony's.  The restaurant is way cute, service is great and you like the feeling you have when you're there.  It'd be good for a date, business meeting or just fun night out.    Btw, we found their tent at the farmer's market a few weeks ago and had to come in after that.  Offering up inexpensive, tasty breakfast pizza is a great marketing move! :)  And the 'sample' of wine that was delivered to our table when we first sat down was a good move too.    I'd go again if friends wanted to meet here but I'd order something that did not have a tomato-based sauce.  Might not see ya there!",

For our main courses, I had the eggplant and he had the stuffed shells. We each tried a bite of each others meals and I liked the shells as much as the eggplant! I have had the manicotti there too and it was great. So now I'll be in a quandary the next time I go, what to order? If THAT was my only decision in life!

Not horrible, but with the number of really good independent Italian restaurants in the valley - why waste your time and money?  Specifics:  Manicotti - Filled with a tasteless ricotta cheese paste that could double as drywall filler, topped with warm crushed tomatoes and a couple shreds of melted mozzarella.  Fettuccine Alfredo - The pasta was sticky and gummy. The \"Alfredo\" sauce was a plain white sauce with flecks of something that may have been an attempt at seasoning.  Italian Sausage - Way overcooked, dry, like trying to saw wood when cutting into it. Nicely spicy though.  Chicken Piccata - Beaten and lightly fried the cutlet was nonetheless dry. Topped with a mixture of mushrooms, capers, and tomatoes. Not just topped, buried under. Disappointing and still the best dish served.",

Anyways, the food is phenomenal. My personal favorite is the Alfredo (I know, boring) Once you are seated, the server brings you garlic bread and antipasto salad. Every server we have is nice and happy to help. Even though we don't go all the time, the servers try to remember our orders, wow! The food always comes out fast even when the restaurant is jam-packed. The atmosphere is nice, and marches the Italian-homey feel. The prices are incredibly affordable for a sit-down restaurant. They even have a loyalty card. Go 5 times, and the next time your entree is free with purchase of another entree. If you can't finish , they box up the food for you Basically, I love this place and I would recommend.",

Their antipasti salad (it's served with bread sticks when buying an entree)  is soooo good, better than Olive Garden's for sure. I love how everyone there is super friendly and helpful. The owners are wonderful to talk to when I had a complaint about a waitress one time. My sister and I love coming here for lunch and dinner because they have a pasta special called the \"Pasta-bilities\" affordable @ $6.99 and you get to choose your pasta/sauce/toppings.

Anyways. I COULD order just their delicious salad and bread here and be totally satisfied, but I never do. I always have a terrible time deciding between Penne Rosa (probably my favorite), Baked Rigatony, Capellini Checca, Chicken Picatta, Stuffed Shells, and a ton of other things. I love them all. We've also ordered their large to-go pans for parties at home several times, and those have always been fantastic as well.

Normally you go to a restaurant and think you're getting a great lunch deal, and later you find out your Coke was three bucks, and multiplied by everyone at your table that really adds up.  But here the pop was just a buck along with your lunch entree. Score!  The patio was so pleasant, and the servers were super-attentive.  As a bonus, the food was top notch.  (Today's special... Lasagna!)  We were in and out in one hour.  I have no complaints!! I will be back, as there are so many other dishes I would like to try! My pal enjoyed her little personal-sized pizza as well!",

And the Cannoli are HEAVENLY.  Buon appetito!",

I guess that place going out of business wasn't too hard to imagine. Fast forward to 2014. This place is ALWAYS packed. We try to get here before 11:30 on regular days so we won't be on the waiting list. A few times we even turned around and went somewhere else because the wait was too long. Oh and Fridays? Fugedaboutit!!! Still, this is on the lunch rotation with a number of my coworkers. We always get the lunch specials. I get the lasagna (Monday special) usually no matter what day of the week it is. You get salad and bread but go easy or you won't finish your main course. Well, that's the way it is for me usually. Your mileage may vary according to how many seats you take up on a plane. I've tried a bunch of other stuff but lasagna has always been my favorite. But don't worry, tough guy, they got pasta - they got all that shit! They also have those loyalty cards which are good to take advantage of if you come here a lot because you fill it up and get a free lunch on the next visit. Can't argue with that. This is my favorite Eyetalian joint in the area. We've been to Marcello's right down the friggin' street but we all agreed this place was a better bang for the buck and had much better service. Parking is easy - it's in a mall - it's in a mall with Harbor Freight Tools and Dunkin Donuts. Check it out.",

There sauce is always flavored to the perfect amount and creamy. The service is decent but varies so much, you never see the same person twice working there(which is a little concerning).

Food was as other reviewers have said darn good. We had Chicken Parm and Yes that salad is very very good. Bread as well good. It's good that the Salad and Bread are included.  Server didn't freak out when we told her we wanted butter over the Olive Oil drink for the bread.  Cappuccino Dessert (we shared ) yummy. Only complaint. Wine in short glasses. They may do that in Italy - but hey we're not. The glass was a short glass like a juice glass, & so clumsy to pick up, and at 5.50 a pop, I want a Wine Glass. Just saying....Oh well -I'll just ask for one next time. Won't keep me from enjoying my dinner. Even though its a 30 min. drive we will definitely go back.",

But somehow when I rarely go there week-day lunch times, there's one waiter who's very aggressive to where we, as customers have to feel some kind of pressure while we are trying to enjoy the meal. It happened twice already. The last time my mom and I visited there(a few weeks ago) we got the same waiter for our table. I remembered him and his service, and I was not really happy about it. I was not wrong. Everything was okay until the end. As my mom still has her folk in her hand and eating, the waiter asked her to pass her finished salad plate to him. My mom had to put her folk down to pass it to him. I was shocked how he asked his still-eating customer to pass a dirty dish so he can clean up the table as fast as he could! I am not trying to ambush that waiter but the manager, please educate your waiter the basic customer service. He wears glasses, he is thin and tall, and light skinned. I think his area is around the bar.",

    "text": "Oh my goodness...a 30 minute wait at  restaurant on a Friday night...that hasn't happened in a while...it must be a good sign!   I haven't had to wait at a restaurant in forever, but RigaTony's was very accommodating and would bring around samples of fresh pizza to keep you from keeling over from hunger!  Once we were seated, our waiter brought over samples of the house Chianti...what a nice touch...we had gotten free pizza and free wine and hadn't ordered a thing yet!  The menu is not huge, but has a lot of the traditional Italian favorites.  We ordered the fried zucchini to start, because my sister is currently obsessed with it!.  Before we got our zucchini, we were brought a huge bowl of salad and warm bread.  The salad was a mix of lettuces, onion, olives, peppercini's and salami in a really nice dressing.  I am not usually a salad eater, but I really liked this one, and even had seconds!  The girls said that the bread was really good, especially when dipped in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar mixture.  The zucchini came out and it was a huge plate of zucchini strips served with a side of basil ranch.  The strips were seasoned just perfectly, and weren't greasy at all, and the basil ranch was a nice change from the norm.  By this point, we were starting to get full, and our entrees hadn't even arrived yet!  Our entrees arrived and they were all huge!  I got the cannelloni, filled with veal, spinach and cheese; they were some of the best I have ever had.  I have previously had some very, very dry cannelloni, but that was not the case with these.  They were served with a side of spaghetti, which I thought was a bit funny, but it actually worked really well together.  The others had cheese ravioli in pink sauce (she raved), spaghetti and meatballs and the RigaTony pasta with sausage.  We all really enjoyed our dishes....and we all had leftovers to take home!  And when I reheated my cannelloni, it was almost even better the next day!  This is currently my favorite Italian place, so much better than VinciTorio's around the corner....and I will be visiting them the next time a craving for Italian food strikes!",

The salad is filled with good stuff (that costs money... not cheap)...  and the bread, yum!  First time through I had the baked Rigatoni.  Well, I was a little disappointed because I was expecting more marinara sauce.   Second time (today) had Meatball sub.  WOW.  This was killer.  The bread was a knockout and then I finally got my marinara sauce.  YUM x10.  Good job Riga Tony's.  Price is right where it needs to be.  A good value (and I would say especially for lunch).  Con's:  Hard to say really.    With all the Italian options this one really for the money and cooking a good find.  I've heard about it for years but just never got there.  So glad I did this week (and to think it is right down the road from me).  Will be back!",

Not only due to the amazing quality of food! Such consistency which is quite rare to find an Italian restaurant in Arizona.  The servers, the hostess, management & owners treat customers like family.  We have worked our way through the entire menu.  My favorite for lunch is the baked Rigatony. For dinner the Penne Rosa hands down!  No matter how full I am I will ALWAYS make room for the apple bread pudding.  It's the best in Arizona!  Rigatonys is reasonably priced an excellent portions.  every meal comes with an anti-pasta salad fresh bread with olive oil and fresh seasonings for dipping.  The vibe here is just right. They also have a loyal dining membership, which leads to buy one entree get one free. Card #2 is buy one get one & a free dessert.  The card #3 is a $20 gift card.  I don't know what I like best about this place. The food or the amazing customer service!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to write a review on one of my favorite places.

I was with a friend and given that we had not met for a while, decided to go to a casual yet elegant setting and what better place than Rigatony's.  It was a very quiet night for a Monday and in the end we were really not very hungry and order two appetizers and a dessert.  The server seemed so very anxious and kept coming constantly asking us about if we wanted to order entrees.  I just felt very rushed there and so did my friend.  In a True family style Italian Restaurant and I have been to many including Italy, they thrive on the fact that you take your time to talk and enjoy the moment rather than being rushed like a fast food experience.  The thing that really shocked me is that they charged $8.50 us for the salad, which we never asked for and I always thought came complementary and also a split charge for $3.50 as well, considering we both got appetizers and just decided to share it.   Wow that is some rip off for sure.  I strongly believe that truth in advertising is so important to a business.  It does not matter if they serve the tastiest food, but unscrupulous billing was certainly very shocking.  I sadly left a very generous tip for the server, having been one myself.  Given this experience, I would rather take my business elsewhere.",

I hold this place fondly in my heart for many reasons, but it doesn't get a 4 star rating simply for nostalgia...   ~Fud/Drink~ They have all the traditional Italian-American food staples, however their menu boasts flavors that Olive Garden and other cookie-cutter Italian stores wish they had. The seafood dishes, which I have had before, actually taste fresh. The Linguini in Clam Sauce was the last dish I chose, very rich and fresh once again. The clams matched pasta well and did not overtake the dish. The balance of all the sauces seems to serve each dish well. Many a time I have had Italian that was overpowered by sauces that took away from the dish, rather than complemented it...not here. Rigatony's has a full bar menu you can order your favorite drink from, as well as numerous wine options which pair well with foods on their menu. Is this dining elegance here? No. But the foods on the menu are rock solid, taste great and are comparable in price to the portion you get.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ The waitstaff are all courteous and knowledgeable of the items on the menu. I normally ask them to help me in my decision, and its imperative they have a general idea of what the menu has available for us. I have been twice, and both times the staff were quick to help us order and get our food in. The last time I went however, they did take a good amount of time to get the bill to us. That did not sour the night out, however it was a good 15+ minutes from the time I asked to the time it got to the table. That's just a bit too long after I personally request for the bill and you only have about two other tables to wait on.....Oh well, that's been the only hiccup here, so I can write that off :) The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing. Its not overly romantic, it has more of a homey feeling inside with a nice Italian music backdrop. It is a family owned restaurant by the way, so you do not have a chain-restaurant feel to it like you do when you go into a Olive Garden..if that makes sense...  ~Extras/Rating~ Try their desserts. I have seen them and they look gorgeous. We have been too stuffed to ever try them, but I am sure one of the desserts will take the night to the next level if you do. Overall, this place is solid. They do a great job with treating the customer right and provide quality food with the right portions. Just like you'd expect from a family-owned restaurant. Please come any time of the day, however many people seem to enjoy their happy hour/Early Bird specials. Hope you enjoy it here, they treat you very well and you will go home happy! 4 stars for having quality, fresh dishes at proper rates, and providing solid service. They are among the cream of the crop of family-style Italian Restaurants.",

    "text": "My family and I have been loyal customers of Rigatony's since our move to Chandler in 2001.  We have taken our family and friends, and have recommended this restaurant many times over the years.  My brother and family are currently visiting from New York State and wanted to go for Italian, so we immediately suggested Rigatonys. Our salad and bread were delicious as usual, but we were extremely disappointed by the entrees served.  Our table ordered 2 chicken Parmesan, 2 chicken Marsala, and 1 chicken piccata entree.  The chicken on every plate was dry, hard and difficult to cut with a knife, let alone chew!  Rigatony's historically has pounded the veal/chicken into nice, thin pieces, but these pieces were thick, tough, and chewy.  The Marsala sauce was syrupy sweet, without a hint of Marsala wine flavor.   The piccata sauce had no lemon taste whatsoever, and the pasta was mushy and overcooked.  Even the marinara sauce for the Parmesan had a sweet taste to it, very unlike the rich red sauce we had come to love at Rigatony's.  We were embarrassed that we told our guests this was a destination for good Italian food.  Whatever changes have been made in the kitchen, please- change it back!",

EVERYTHING here is delicious!  start with the garlic clams for appetizers. it is so damned good you will want to soak up the remaining juice with your bread.  the starter salad is great! it has many ingredients and it is fresh. I love this salad so much, I ate it as an entree in one of my visits.  there are many entrees that I love here. I usually go with the tour. it's a combination of lasagna, chicken picata, salsiccia, rigatoni, and a pasta shell stuffed with cheese (I think).  everything here is a hit. everyone has their own opinion and will like one dish more than the other. I do agree with a past yelper about the tomato sauce being a little sweet in the lasagna. other than that, I can't find anything wrong with this place.  service has always been great. I'm starting to get annoyed with people that count the seconds that it takes to get refills on water and s**t like that.  PLEASE PEOPLE! it's not like you're dining at the Ritz! it's a mom & pop place that charge reasonable for what I consider a tasty meal. I will dine here ten times over before eating at your typical AZ Chillis, Applebees, & TGIF.  one last thing. Dan, who last served me, makes a great cappuccino!",

    "text": "Okay....So is the food okay? Yes it is fine, average.  I am writing this review purely on the service, which should mean something. First, we made a reservation and were seated quite quickly. So far so good. We went on a weekday and it was very busy. With an hour for lunch, started to worry. Our waitress did not show up for fifteen minutes after we were seated and we asked twice. She showed up and we placed our orders. Twenty minutes later our food showed up. It was okay. The waitress never came back to see how things were, if we needed drink refills, nothing. It was like she was on a break during a very busy lunch rush. The table next to us got their lunch after waiting an hour and fifteen minutes and were very upset. We ordered an appetizer, Calamari at $11.00. Two of us shared it and the same two decided to share a sandwich. The other two just ordered their meals. When the bill came there was a $3 extra charge for the sandwich. They charged us for splitting it, although the sandwich was not cut in two or served on two separate plates (although the lady I was splitting with had to get up and go find a plate from a busboy). I was not happy with this considering the service was terrible and the fact that we had ordered the appetizer to split which was more expensive then the dish we had ordered to split so I figured it was as good as ordering a dish. Well, we asked for the manager and that was an absolute nightmare. He came over, I explained that I was unhappy about the extra charge because the meal was not split and we ordered an appetizer. He started to tell me that it is how they keep the costs down. When I said..but we decided to get an appetizer and split a lunch he very rudely and aggressively told me that I was not listening to him and he was trying to explain to me why it was charged. As a result of his rudeness I told him I did not want to hear his explanation and just wanted the charge removed. He literally face palmed me and removed the charge. Terrible management for the service industry. I will NEVER EVER come back to Rigatony's and make sure everyone I know hears this story. Customer service still means something but apparently, they do not get this. Maybe when their lunch rush slows (which it will under the current management), they will get the hint. Don't go here, especially for lunch. The food quality does not justify the aggravation.",

As a regular here, I asked if our favorite service was working, but rather than the manger explaining while she was let go I was not only shocked but felt belittled because they \"didn't have time for a stupid question\". Once we were seated in a section, the waitress we had not only messed up every one of our orders and forgot to bring out a plate for one of our party member in general. I understand that everyone has their days and they do mess up, but the only server at that restaurant who has not completely ruined our orders at this restaurant is Jessica M. because the restaurant has sadly let her go. It's very unfortunate that we will no longer be dining at this establishment, because they no longer have a competent wait staff and for a family restaurant are no longer make it feel like a \"family atmosphere\". I am disappointed, get it together.",

Then with a table crowded with food, the entree arrives , wow four minutes. The waitress stacks my plates for me with the food I'm eating on them still. By the time we finished the appetizer, our food was cold. Mostly due to hot food served on cold plates. But even after all that time pasta was still way to firm. An dente taken to far.

Basically what I got was 3 cups of wet romaine lettuce, about a tablespoon of diced tomato, a table spoon or less of cheese, and when I cut up the small amount of chicken provided it yielded 8 bite sized pieces.    One of my admin's ordered shrimp alfredo, the fettuccini was wet, which watered everything down, and they gave her a whopping 4 small shrimp.

Our waitress was very knowledgeable - gave us gluten free options as well. Antipasto salad was tremendous and v fresh with a tasty dressing. The bread was warm and good and the dipping olive oil was spectacular. Ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana dinner which came with spaghetti on the side. Breaded and cooked just right with really great marinara sauce. Asked for some more sauce which I promptly got . Sat in the outdoor covered patio which was really nice on a pleasant night. The staff were happy and having a good time. Bringing a group of friends here to experience the awesome meal, atmosphere and service. 5 stars indeed.",

    "text": "Although we like coming here, many times the service is not the best. Hence the 3 stars.  They do have a loyalty program.   Kids eat free on Mondays, however, they forget to mention...not if the Monday is a holiday.  And by holiday, not the usual calendar holidays...example, they consider both Christmas Eve and NY eve a holiday.   Their salad is fantastic, and if you get the bread freshly made, it is great, too. In my opinion, these are the best part of this restaurant.  Dinner prices are well above lunch prices.   They do have carry-out that you can call ahead for.  They do take reservations...however, they dont actually HOLD the reservation (ala Seinfeld)...we made one today,  arrived on time, and they still made us wait...so far waiting 15 minutes! Fantastic.   This place is quite popular, so it may be a wait, even if you go well past dinnertime or lunchtime.",

    "text": "This is my family's go to in the Tempe/Chandler area.  We have been going her since their original location down in Chandler for over 10 years now.    They have great lunch specials (one of their entrees for $8.95, it is set for each day of the week) & the food is very reasonable for what you get.  I don't believe there is any food item over $15 on the menu.  They also have an incredible rewards program, believe you get something free after every 5th meal.  All the entrees start with their house salad.  If you don't like their salad, you clearly don't like eating.  It is a Italian dressing with cut up salami & cheese.  It blows away most house salads I have ever had.  Their bread has a great crust on it.  For entrees, they have a great standard chicken Parmesan with an excellent cut of chicken.  Their pork chops are very juicy and tasty, but not huge.  If you are hungry I would suggest doing the double order, unless you want to fill up on salad.  They have excellent build your own pizza's (they are decent size) as well.  Finally dessert...when I do get one, I get the spumoni.  It is a gellato style spumoni.  This is the only one I have had, but the other desserts have looked really tasty.    It is not the fanciest restaurant, but it has a nice atmosphere.  I would say it is a 4-1/2, but I give them a benefit of the doubt since we have never had a bad experience there.",

A friend that I hadn't seen in about 22 years was driving though and hit me up on FB and said Hey lets have dinner, find somewhere off the I-10 and make it Italian and RigaTony's was the perfect place to pick!   We meet up around 5pm on a Wednesday night, the place was busy, but not packed, I was loving how they decorated for Christmas, made me feel like I was going to a party :)   Our server was Michelle and she was very helpful answering whatever questions my friends had, and she was excellent at making sure we had everything we needed, love great service  After we checked out the menu I decided I wanted the lasagna & spaghetti combo. My friend ordered the chicken with lemon & artichoke and her husband ordered the spaghetti deluxe.  Then the antipasto salad & freshly baked ciabatta bread came out, OMG this salad is to die for, I love love love it!! Stop going to the Olive Garden people, this is the salad you should be having!! And the bread!! I love me some fresh baked bread, so much better than sticks!   My lasagna was delish baby! It was so flavorful too, the cheese, the noodles the sauce, omg I can't believe I ate it all, I ordered it with the intention of having some for lunch the next day, nope that didn't happen!  So good!!  The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the sauce was the perfect amount and great in flavor! Loved the combo!   My friends, they too loved their dishes and were happy we picked RiggaTonys for dinner!! It was great seeing her and sharing a great meal too!   A fun tip I did learn about RiggaTonys is once a month on Monday night they have a Wine dinner, where you dine on 5 course dinner that the Chef prepares for just that night; I will have to check that out soon!",

I came here on a whim, wanting to carb load before an early Camelback hike.  Being my first time, I was surprised at the crowd waiting for a table.  When the hostess informed me of a 20 minute wait time, I spied a lonely seat at the bar and made a break for it.  I asked the enthusiastic bartender for a hefe and orange, but the unfiltered wheat beer was not on the menu.  He convinced me to go with a Peroni, and it was sheer perfection, and balanced perfectly with my meal.  The $4.50 a bottle seemed steep... I must be conditioned for the dollar PBRs.  Starting out with the fried ravioli appetizer, which consisted of four large puffs of ricotta in a pasta shell, swimming in a delightful marinara.  This dish was smooth and cheesy, each bite eliciting the next.  I should have stopped here, but I hadnt eaten all day, choosing instead to brood in a bed with sweat stained sheets.  For round #2, I decided on the chicken parm, due to Ashlie's review.  To me, the red sauce on this dish tasted strange, unlike the savory sauce from the appetizer.  Of course, that didnt stop me from eating 72.8% of it.  The entree also came with two thick slices of toasted french loaf and a chopped anti-pasto salad.  This place rocked!  And the bar aint a bad place to saddle up to.  It's like the single-riders line at DCA's Radiator Springs Racers",

I ordered the margarita pie and was expecting what you'd normally get at many other restaurants - a pizza with red sauce, fresh sliced mozz and some basil. Their menu said it also came with tomato which I thought would be fine as well.  The pizza comes out and it's literally a normal cheese pizza with tomato and basil on top with NO SAUCE.............. We ask the waitress when she comes back to check on us, \"Isn't this pizza supposed to have sauce on it?\" We didn't even bother asking about the fresh sliced mozzarella. She says she doesn't know but will go check. She then proceeds to bring us a menu and says, \"Well the menu just says it has tomato, basil and olive oil.\" Okay...... Well on the menu, it says your Americana Pizza just has Pepperoni, Sausage and Mushroom. So does that one not have sauce either???? I doubt it. I'm sure it comes with sauce even though the menu doesn't explicitly list \"SAUCE\" as one of the toppings.  She said the cook could re-make it but it would be another 20 minute wait. No thanks. She ended up bringing us some marinara on the side but it just wasn't the same. My sweet husband said he'd eat it like that to be nice but we basically didn't touch it. Half of one slice was eaten so we paid over $20 for that tragedy of a pizza. I was surprised and disappointed that it wasn't taken off our bill when it was clearly made incorrectly and we didn't eat any of it. Meh. Definitely a letdown and an opportunity for their staff to work on customer recovery solutions.",

    "text": "I had to try RigaTony's after I saw that my Yelp friend, Joyce W, received the ROTD here.   I have mixed feeling after my visit.  They have the potential to be a great restaurant.  We arrived at about 7 PM to a packed restaurant.  Fortunately, I had made reservations and were seated immediately.    We ordered the a smoked salmon pasta, the four cheese penne and a spaghetti with meat sauce.  To our surprise, after ordering, they brought out an antipasto salad and some bread.  The antipasto salad was delicious.  It had plenty of meat and cheese.  The bread was okay.  It was like any other bread that we have had.  If we had known about the salad and bread, we probably would've only ordered 2 pastas and shared.    Their pastas dishes were enormous.  I loved their portion sizes.  If we weren't traveling, I would've taken the leftover pasta home.  The meatball and sausage spaghetti and the four cheese penne were winners.  Their sauce was full of meat and not acidic (sour).  Just the way we like it.  The sausage in my the spaghetti was chopped up.  I prefer my sausage uncut in one piece.  The four cheese penne was so go that my daughter devoured it without sharing.  My wife was disappointed in the smoked salmon pasta.  We thought that the smoked salmon pasta had a good taste, but, we all thought that the smoked salmon pasta was in the microwave oven a few minutes too long as the pasta around the edges seemed really dry.    Overall, I liked this place.  It seemed like a great deal with the antipasto salad and bread.  Their portion sized was generous.  Stick with their popular items like their meat or Alfredo sauce, and everything should be great.  3 1/2 stars.",

We had the mussels appetizer, which was delicious & served in a light tomato garlic sauce. We also had the baked rigatoni & the shrimp & scallop scampi. Pasta was so well done & melt in your mouth delicious. All the flavors were right on point. We also enjoyed the tiramisu which was so light & creamy. The salad that came included with dinner was pre-mixed & perfect & we noticed you could even get them to go in a case in the lobby. The bread for the table was good & crusty & a second plate was automatically brought over once we finished the first. We didn't care much for the dipping oil which was not as good quality or as nicely seasoned as other Italian restaurants we've been to...we tried adding more to it (crushed red pepper & grated Parmesan) but it was the oil...(odd undertaste). No worries, we ended up dipping the bread in the mussels tomato sauce & it was heaven! Highly recommend RigaTony's...great place to eat!",

We got the fried zucchini app, meals came w large family style salad + fresh bread for entrees got the baked rigatony w sausage, cheese ravioli w alfredo sauce add shrimp, and a side of the tomato cream sauce (so good), chicken alfredo and chicken parm.We all shared these dishes and enjoyed them all. Will probably pass on the chicken parm next time though wasnt really anything special.   For your birthday they give you a free bread pudding dessert which was really good, we also shared the tiramisu and spumoni ice cream, both were the best we have ever had! Will definitely  come back!!",

My only disappointment here has been the white italian bread vs breadsticks or garlic knots openly served but everything else makes up for this shortcoming. It does get crowded and can be over an hour wait at time to get in which can be a hassle. So plan ahead if your planning to eat here. So far everything I have ordered off this menu has been great and the wait staff is always amazing. The food and staff make you want to return here. Wish they would open another location in North Phoenix but let's be real probably wouldn't be as good as the original.",

Our food and the service was perfect in every way, better than expected actually. I was in the area and we had been wanting to try some authentic Italian food. The salad first of all is off the charts! I am IN LOVE with their dressing, wow! It's served family style with bread. I had told my server I was a vegetarian so she offered to put the meat on the side. I didn't realize there is a bit on top of the salad usually so that was great, hadn't even considered it. For our entrees we ordered the Chicken parm and the Fettucini alfredo with veggies. First off, the veggies were not overcooked like a lot of places tend to do. They were fresh, crunchy and a lot of variety. Thank you for offering so many options for the vegetarians! Much appreciated. Now....for the sangrias. I am a big sangria fan and they had several on their happy hour menu. The price was $3.50/glass and I gotta say it's a nice size and is quite delicious. I opted for the strawberry lemon because it was different. In these hot Arizona summers  I found it to be very refreshing! They have a sampler of sangrias for just $9 too on the HH menu. It sounds amazing and had I been with other friends would've opted for that but I can only drink so much myself. Sadly. All in all, our server was attentive in every way and took care of us with anything we needed. The meal was fantastic. I can't wait to go back and try some of their other dishes.",

Their portions are plentiful and the quality is spot on, they even give you a great complimentary anti pasta salad with your meal thats equally amazing.

It's a great neighborhood Italian restaurant and they are always packed with lots of locals. One of my favorite things is the free all-you-can-eat bread and salad with your meal. Second thing is I love the community feel this place has. Most of the tables are round and salad comes out in a big bowl that you pass around. They really promote family here. Popular dishes include their steamed clams, baked RigaTony, deep dish lasagna and stuffed ravioli. If you want to try a bit of everything, get the Tour of RigaTony's (a sample of some their favorites like chicken picatta, baked manicotti & fettuccino alfredo). They also have some gluten-free options as well. Like I said, there is usually is a wait. But they have a bar area you can grab a glass of wine and mix and mingle while waiting. They also have a mini store in the front with some fun gimmicky toys and Italian grocery items like pasta or olives you can take home. The service for me has always been excellent. I've been trying new dishes and recently had the Chicken Cutlets Piccata and loved it. If you want an appetizer, I recommend their shrimp and pesto bruschetta. For decor, they have many photos of people that have visited here over the years that adorn the walls. RigaTony's plays a part in the community by donating meals to local organizations like Paz de Cristo and Tempe Community Action Center to feed the homeless.",

Both were exceptional. For my lunch plate I went for the Italian Chop Single with spaghetti and marinara sauce, and green beans It was delicious and the pork chop was seasoned just right and tender. For dessert I ordered the cappuccino pie, I shared with my granddaughter. It was delicious and was huge. I will give RigaTony's five stars because the service by our waiter was exceptional and everyone including myself enjoyed our food  Update: Today was the second visit to this restaurant. The food is excellent and the service is excellent. Of course because we were a large group, we had to request Tony's room. This provides some privacy from the rest of the restaurant. Great room to be in when you're celebrating birthdays. Which was our case, especially with the good company we had. Just as a tip, their serving portions are more than enough, so if you are a light eater order something to your taste and light. Our compliments go out to our waiter, Scott.  He is nice representation of the restaurant.",

This place fills the void, I love the homey ambiance, we love trying local businesses they have to put more heart into what they serve to stay afloat.I've had pretty much every pasta dish and have yet to be disappointed. The only thing I would add is if your here during dinner time be patient with the wait its worth it.",

They gave it to me with the warmest, nicest welcome, as sweet as could be.  They even threw in a free slice of cake.  It was the coolest, nicest experience ever.  The food, too, was excellent.

I've been here probably three times, and on every occasion the servers and hosts are super friendly and fast. One of the managers will always stop by your table to say hello! For this round my fiance and I shared the shrimp pesto bruchetta, spaghetti supreme, and 2 cannolis. I forget what the bill was but because we chose an appetizer and dessert with just one entree, the price wasn't bad and it actually filled us up. Actually for an Italian restaurant, Rigatony's is very reasonable. Everything was delicious, especially the fresh bread and salad that comes with. Everything is so fresh, you can definitely taste the difference. Make sure to ask for a stamp card on your next visit. You'll get a free entree after so many meals.",

It is flavorless. All the pasta dishes are mediocre in terms of flavor and sauce. Their alfredo sauce is not made in-store, it comes from a jar. This place is like a Chili's masquerading as an authentic family restaurant.   There are better Italian places in the Valley, with Nick's being a top contender for the best family-owned place I have been.",

Oh, and we had the zucchini appetizer and it was a huge portion but I didn't care for the dill ranch that came with it. The dill just took over. Mom had the special which was a shrimp, penne, roasted red pepper, artichoke hearts and feta dish. She loved it. This would be a 3 star review because the food was decent enough but our server Pippa was so great! We really enjoyed her service and she listened to mom rant on about Ireland even though she was a bit busy. My mom left her a coin from Scotland and she was so thankful and sweet. Next time, we'd definitely ask for her. For dessert, mom had the spumoni and I had the apple bread pudding. Both were very good.",

I recommend to try it at lunch, any day of the week, order the daily special, and plan to be full as the complimentary salad is bottomless and quite hardy.  If you want to be on the lighter side, some items can switch out pasta for green beans, I recommended asking for them with the marinara sauce, comes out even better that the pasta version for a small extra charge.  Lastly, if you're there for a special occasion, the desserts will not disappoint.  Over the last few years I think we've tried every one of them, and everything is fresh and decadent.",

Our waiter, Andrew was nice enough and we didn't have to wait too long to be seated and served.  I ordered the spaghetti with marinara and cheese ravioli & my girlfriend took advantage of the $7.95 lunch special where she was able to get fettuccine alfredo with shrimp and broccoli. Our meals came with a delicious Antipasto salad topped with house made Italian dressing that the chefs were kind enough to make meatless for me. Yum yum yum! We finished those off well before our meals came,with delight! Ciabatta bread was also included. Very plain in my opinion. I always prefer garlic. For our drinks we ordered water w lemon. It was so refreshing. It tasted filtered which was appreciated and unexpected.   The only real con was in my entree. The marinara was so sweet! I love marinara but not too sweet. Still edible but it wasn't my favorite. I doctored it up w cheese, salt and pepper which helped a bit. I guess for that, to each his own. You may love it :)  Overall though, not a bad experience. Not AMAZING. But good.   Thanks for reading! Hope this helps.",

    "text": "Review is for Thursday 10/5/17...took a few days to get around to writing it.   It is difficult to write a review for a place everybody knows is great.  But I will do my best. We go enough that we have filled at least three frequent diner cards.  There were four of us celebrating my mother's 89th birthday.  Her main objective was the fried zucchini.  They came out hot, just the right amount of breading and the cuts were just the right size.  I cant find any better in the valley.  If there are please let me know.   Rally, I would like to try them.  Service We had Marissa.  She was great.  Patient with the table.  Made the salad exactly how we requested (extra tomatoes for my dad...no onion).  Drinks never empty.  Worked with some indecision on what to eat.  I would have screamed...Just pick something.    Service is usually OK.  Never bad.  But never this good.  Well we have had Marissa before so it was great then also.    We try to eat there during the off times...always...so I cannot comment on what the service is like when people eat at normal times.  We plan to go for late lunch or early dinner. (They have great lunch and early bird specials.) Check their website.   Food They make the cheese raviolis.  No they really do.  And you can tell.  Also any other pasta always comes out cooked to perfection.  And they will not tell you how they tenderize the chicken.  It is a secret.    They do not use garlic as a weapon.  Some Italian places think you just have to use a lot of garlic to make it Italian.   We talked my mom into the chicken picatta, with fettuccine alfredo.  Big hit with mom and wife.  I had the chicken parm...how do they tenderize it?  It is consistently perfect.  Never had it overcooked.    My dad had angel hair pasta and two giant meatballs. Almost as good as mine.  Almost...  Dessert Oh and the bread pudding is worth more than what they charge.  All four of ate one order.  It was soft, but not mushy.  The flavors were perfect and the sauce was great.   Timing Be warned, they do take reservations, but if you eat at normal adult/dating times you will wait.  Particularly now that our friends from the north are returning.",

They offer great specials and fun events all the time (i.e. monthly wine pairing dinner opportunities or the Facebook bracket race to see which RigaTony dish is the absolute fan favorite!). Portions are large with extremely reasonable prices to match. What more can a girl ask for?!  I also wanted to point out how lovely their service has always been. Yes, the wait can feel long at times, but as soon as you're seated, the service is on point.  There was one incident where I ordered a family meal go-to to get us through the next few days. We didn't check the boxes before we left and didn't realize that one of our main dishes was completely missing until 2 days later. I didn't really expect to get anything back, but I messaged their Facebook page to let them know what happened, just in case they noticed they had an extra box of something 2 days eariler, and to my surprise the manager apologized for the mishap and offered us a redo of the whole family meal package, completely free of charge! He just got me out of cooking for a whole week now! The RigaTony's staff went out of their way to keep their customers happy. It's such a hard thing to find in today's world, so we're forever grateful.",

The antipasto salad is served family style with homemade dressing (the best I've ever had) and seasoned Italian Bread and I believe it comes with every entree.  Delicious fried zucchini overflows the plate it's served on.  Every entree I've tried is top notch.  Today I had the zucchini appetizer,  angel hair pasta in lemon butter sauce topped with spinach, a glass of sangria,  mushroom and shrimp from the lunch menu.  Entree served with all you can eat antipasto and bread.  Spumoni for dessert.  I brought home a 2 topping pizza for my husband which also came with antipasto salad and 3 slices of bread.  My total bill came to $45.78 for all of this delicious food and leftovers!",

    "text": "Our party made a reservation for 4 per the restaurants suggestion.  When we got there our party had been increased by one, so we had to wait an additional 20 minutes which did not seem out of line.  I don't remember the last time I had to make a reservation for dinner in the greater Phoenix area however, but after standing in line outside of a Lone Star or any other restaurant in town on a Friday night maybe it's something we need to go back to so props to them for the old school throwback memory.  Back to the food:  I had the Alfredo with sausage, and my wife had the Alfredo with chicken.  My daughter and guests had the spaghetti Deluxe and one guest had the lasagna.  I can't say if the lasagna dish was great or not as I have not heard back from her on it so far, but my wife and I weren't thrilled with our Alfredo dishes.  The portion size was crazy huge, but the flavor was just average.  My daughter said the sausage was a bit too spicy for her in her spaghetti, but also that between the meat sauce, meatballs and sausage there was hardly any noodles.  She made the comment on the ride home she had the meat sweats from trying to eat it all.  My family and I discussed it and we all agreed that the pricing and atmosphere are good, and the fresh bread and starter salads was great, but as for the main dishes they just didn't \"do it\" for us.  We'd go back again with friends if we are invited, but otherwise it just doesn't land on our places to bookmark for future reference.",

I was hesitant at first because we waited quite a while for someone to come take our drink order, but for their defense, there was a huge party there at the same time. Once the waiter took our order, the meal kept getting better and better.  First, they brought out bread with oil at the same time they brought fresh salad. The salad was mixed right in front of us. Super fresh and delicious with an amazingly flavorful dressing.   Then, the main meal. We decided to share the baked RigaTony with meatballs. They brought out two separate plates, both baked and plated separately. It was like having our own meals; I would have never known we split it. AND Every bite was worth every creamy, cheesy calorie.   At the end, they brought out an apple bread pudding with whipped cream for the birthday boy. Yum. It was creamy and just enough sweet. Every bite was melt-in-your-mouth.   I would definitely go again. Thank you for a great meal!",

However, I eat alone so I opted to sit at the bar. My bartender/server was Whitney. She's charming and helpful and smiles all the time - - all the qualities of a good server. At her recommendation, I order the baked rigatoni.  My meal comes with a salad that is slightly reminiscent of Olive Garden, however I want to say that it was a MORE version. Higher quality. It had thin strips of salami in it that were just perfect with it. The bread was served warm with olive oil and herbs. Very good bread.  Pretty much everyone loves macaroni and cheese, right? The baked rigatoni is like macaroni and cheese - - the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had. It's not dried out like a lot of macaroni and cheese dishes. The cheese is soft and creamy and delish. It also had a touch of tomato sauce on top that was very garlicky and yummy.  I told Whitney that I haven't drank alcohol in many years and that if I ever started, I believe I would go to RigaTony's. The drinks look ice cold and very appetizing.   Whitney demonstrates the epitome of good service. Well done!",

They were both very tasty. Next we had bread for dipping in olive oil with an exceptional antipasto  salad. Probably could have called it quits....but then came the entrees.   I had a scollop and shrimp pasta dish with feta cheese. Two people shared the Tour of Riga Tony's Special. Another person had the scampi with pasta.  Recovered post food coma. All good...service, food, portion size, and price. FIve stars hands down!!",

Service was what I would expect on a busy Friday night at a great restaurant.  The salad was tasty and fresh, the bread....wow, phenomenal, the bruschetta was perfect and the chicken parm was excellent.  Took home canolis for dessert.   Our server was Tricia and she was super-friendly and quick.  I will definitely be back.",

The restaurant was very homey, with nostalgic items mounted on the walls throughout. Our server, Tatum, greeted us, offered menus and drinks. She was friendly, efficient and knew the menu well.   My wife ordered the Seafood Checca (with GF pasta) and wine while I got Shrimp and Scallop Scampi and an Iced Tea. It came to $53 plus tip.   Our entrees came with house antipasto salad and bread. Both were well constructed with typical Italian notes. The entrees were outstanding. I failed to take a pic cuz I was so hungry but my Scampi had the seafood in a boat and the sauced pasta on the plate. That made it easy to get some angel hair pasta on the fork, capped with a piece of shrimp or scallop. Both items were masterfully prepared, cooked perfectly and very tender.   RigaTony's did not lose their touch over the years and perhaps improved, like a fine wine.",

    "text": "When the sun hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore. When a giant salad and pasta hits the spot in your belly, that's RigaTony's.   From what I understand, and a quick internet search tells me, RigaTony's Authentic Italian has been in the Valley for over 20 years. And they must be doing something right to keep the crowds coming back.   The best way I can describe the restaurant is if Buca di Beppo and Olive Garden had a love child that actually knew how to cook. You'll want to come back and get them again and again. I've been a few times now and know I'm already planning my next return visit.   I wasn't expecting such a delicious Antipasto Salad but I ate it up. Their Italian dressing is killer and goes well with the Genoa salami, Italian cheese, olives, pepperoncinis, onions and tomatoes in the salad. The complimentary freshly baked Ciabatta Bread and olive oil put the breadsticks to shame from that chain place. The Express Lunch Special portion is perfect size to allowing you to finish any weekend errands afterward without the overwhelming desire to for a nap.  There is always room for dessert! You'll want to indulge in their signature Four Layer Chocolate Hazelnut Cake, House Specialty Tiramisu, homemade Cannoli, warm Apple Bread Pudding or classic Spumoni. With so many delicious choices, it is difficult to pick just one so I recommend sharing so you can trying multiple.    See you soon, RigaTony's Authentic Italian!",

    "text": "We chose to come to RigaTony's because we received a gift card from the holidays that we hadn't used yet. So far my experience here is terrible. The host can't do math so for starters I'd recommend making advance reservations. I checked in at 6pm, was told 30-40 minute wait, so we waited, checked in a minute until it had passed 40 minutes, AND was told another 20 minute wait.... THEN I said, \"so my 30-40 minute wait is really an hour wait..\" and then he proceeds to tell me the above time frame in a manner that implied I couldn't do math... what an idiot.  Hopefully the food is better than the wait and host service...  On a lighter note: - restroom has a changing table BUT be careful because the restrooms are small and someone walking in could hit you with the door or run right into you if you stand close enough...  - kids eat free Monday BUT enroute to the restroom you'll see larger groups of older people, and a very older crowd.  - there's decent seating in the waiting area, but overflows quickly... - if your still waiting an hour like my family is, you can help yourself to the large bowl of complementary mints...  They should be more considerate of families with kids...  Update post dinner: Our server was extremely nice and got everything right. The food was great and came out on time. You could tell they were busy but she stayed on top of everything and got our order right. For that I'll give an extra star...",

If you want excellent service ask for little Franky (she rocks); I've noted the mixed reviews here and I won't take anything from others who didn't have a good experience, but whatever they are doing lately seems to work if they will be sure to hire more people like Franky!  As far as the food goes, I've been all over and they do know Italian, certainly it has its own American flavor, but compared to a restaurant with the initials OG it's like being in Florence.",

This is the relatively new Chandler location, and I really like the way they have the restaurant and patio arranged.  We were seated immediately, but afterward it took ten minutes before a server stopped at our table to take our orders. It was exceptionally busy, the server did apologize for the delay, and other than that glitch the service was fine from then on, so it wouldn't be anything that would keep me from returning.  This time I ordered the four cheese ravioli, which was really good - I would recommend this to anyone. The antipasto salad, which I have always enjoyed at RigaTony's, was great - as was the freshly baked bread that they provided to snack on.  In the past I have been a little reluctant to choose RigaTony's because I wasn't really a big fan of their menu, but after this visit I noticed that they offer more of a variety of food choices that are certain to keep me coming back.",

I am intrigued by the option of the quinoa pasta and imagine I will try that in the future. The salad was decent and I liked the dressing (very picky about dressings).

    "text": "We picked this restaurant based on the reviews I read on line. It was the one negative review that cinched it that this was the right restaurant for us. He listed dish after dish he had tried and of course knocked them all. I figured if he had eaten here so many times, the food had to be good in spite of his complaints.   We arrived early on a Wednesday night and the parking lot was full. Based on our experience of eating on the road this is the best sign of a great restaurant. Gene ate the signature \"Rigatony\" and pronounced it delicious. As usual I was undecided and the waiter urged me to describe what I was looking for. I mentioned, angel hair and artichokes and chicken and he brought back something that was not on the menu and anticipated everything I was in the mood for. The bread was good and the salad was hearty with Salomi sliced thin and looked like sliced onions. Service was great and the restaurant nice but unpretentious. Next time in this area we will eat here again.",

    "text": "I must say, this was the worst, most overpriced Italian food I've ever had. First, the salad was, well, salad! Enough said. Nothing special by any means. Our bread had a short, black hair on it so it was left uneaten. The calamari was just plain old frozen calamari that was deep fried. What happened to fresh food? The pizza that was $20 was far from a $20 pizza. It was brought on a regular dinner plate and the center was dropped because the plate wasn't flat, therefore all the grease ran to the center and made it way to soupy. Suggestion, serve pizza on something flat. The flavor was not any better. And being that it was served on a regular dinner plate, it wasn't $20 big. My Capellini Pescatore was sub par. I was graced with a total of five empty clam and mussel shells. Maybe I'm wrong but if someone pays $16 for a seafood dish, it should be a priority to make sure they get the most expensive part, which is the seafood. The pasta was literally in a bath of butter sauce that was supposed to have white wine in it. All I could taste was butter. Drenched in butter. No wine flavor at all.   Our server was a nice young gentleman and he did a good job for the most part. My have drank glass of Sprite was topped off with water though so it kinda went south for him after that. Anyway, from reading the other reviews, I guess people from Arizona just don't know what good Italian food should taste like. The food was not at all worth the $50 bill. We won't be going back.",

The waitress wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed but she was an affable simpleton and tried really hard so kudos to her.   Antipasto salad and ciabata bread were included with the entrees and were both very good. I had a glass of chianti - not very good and my wife had white basil sangria, which was delicious.  I had the deluxe spaghetti which included meat sauce, meatball, and Italian sausage - it was ok. My wife had the ravioli, which tasted home made and delicious. We got 2 cannolis to take home.  All in all, very good. We shall return!  Update: ate the cannolis when we got home - they were GRRRREAT!",

    "text": "Had a great experience tonight.  First, the meals come with all you can eat (good) salad and bread.  The salad has a bunch of stuff: cheese, salami, olives, pepperoncini, etc... Great salad and the bread was pretty good.  I had the eggplant parmeasean with quinoa noodles instead of regular noodles, cooked sicilian style (with garlic, anchovies, peppers, and some other stuff).  It was a huge portion - 2 or three thick slices of eggplant with cheese.  The quinoa noodles were delicious and, i think, at least in theory, are healthier than typical noodles.  you can also get whole wheat or green bean noodles - all at no extra charge.  Sauce tasted homemade, was thick with chunks of tomato and delicious.  Great entree, great portion, and great price (12.25)  My fiance had the salmon penne something.  Was not that great...salmon had very unique and rich smokey flavor, which I am sure some people love.  But not us.  Thats ok - the waitress exchanged our meal for another eggplant parmeasean (to go, since we were full)...and best of all she only charged us for one meal!  We will definitelly be back, just not to get the salmon penne.    You can also split an entree and pay 3$ for the all you can eat salad and bread - which is probably what we will do next time.",

I don't know if she could tell we were on a date or what but she gave us a great corner booth that was a little secluded which was nice.  The waitress came out right away and had a thick Italian accent (always a really good sign when you're at an Italian restaurant!).  She made recommendations and knew how the food was cooked when asked.  I decided to go with the Chicken Parmesan (I know it's not that creative but I love it!) and my date got the Chicken Marsala.  Both were great.  Our plates were cleared when we left.  Before the meal you get salad and crispy garlic bread both of which were also yummy.  Also my water glass never got empty which, to me, is the True test of how good a restaurant's service is.  I'll definitely be returning!",

My dish was absolutely perfect.  The sauce just melted in my mouth.  The portions were very generous, with me barely eating half of my dish.    My husband's dish was pretty good.  He was able to finish it, and he often has left overs.  So his was either super good or his portions were less than mine.    The only draw back is the tables are really close together.  I felt like I kept staring at another person from another table who was really close to me.  It is kind of awkward to finally have a date night and to be seated closer to another person at another table than my husband!    Overall, the food was perfect but the ambiance not so much.  We will definitely go back again and hopefully get a better seat.  With just over a 20% tip our meal was exactly $75 which is perfect for our budget.",

Honestly the few times I ate at the other location I wasn't blown away, so I really didn't care to give them many more chances.   Tonight was completely different than my previous experiences from years ago. This is now officially my favorite Italian restaurant in Arizona. The food is great, and the $7.50 Early Bird Special is an amazing deal. I also appreciated the frequent diner card that was offered to me, and it's awesome that they don't exclude the Early Bird entrees from it. (I really wouldn't blame them if they did exclude the special because you are already getting a discounted meal with it.) BUT what made my visit stand out more than anything was the fabulous level of service I received. Every single employee smiled at me and made me feel welcome and asked me how I was doing. You don't see that very often, and it was very refreshing.",

My husband and I didn't have much to complain about our food, it was pretty good. Not as delicious and memorable as before though. The service during our last visit was horrible. Our waiter took our order and we didn't see him again until he brought our check. No drink refills and we had to eat with our dirty salad plates crowding the table. I will likely give them another chance because of our history, we have been loyal customers for over 10 years. It won't be for some time though.",

All entrees come with salad and nice, crusty bread. They toss the salad at your table when they bring it out to you. The salad is good. It's tossed in a vinaigrette dressing thats quite tasty. You can have seconds if you desire to do so. I'm usually good with one round of salad but will usually opt for more bread to use to soak up the sauce of my entree.   I've only had the pastas here and I haven't had one I didn't enjoy. The meatballs are really good, here. The lasagna is tasty and meaty, though sometimes on the sweet side. On my last visit I had one of the specials on the board, which was a seafood medley pasta. It was a generous amount of seafood sauteed in a vodka pesto sauce. OMG that sauce was amazing! I would've been happy with just a loaf of bread and a bowl of that sauce to dip in as my meal. It reminded me of some kind of seafood chowder bread bowl of some sort. Delicious. Sucks that it was a special on the board and not on their regular menu because I'd order that over and over again.  Service is attentive. Drinks are always filled. They work as a team here as oppose to only one person attending to each table. Prices are very reasonable. It's one of the better italian restaurants in the area.",

Everyone here I come into contact with if very nice and friendly. Gary is our main dude though. Their bread and oil/herbs are to die for. So soft and warm. It just melts in your mouth. They might just have the best bread for an Italian food restaurant. Once you are done tearing up your bread your food comes and you are already full from eating so much bread. Their portions are YUGEEEE! I am always taking some to go. I love their. Penne Rosa w/ Sausage is my go to. No mushrooms though. It doesn't need them anyways. It is still crazy flavorful w/o them.

    "text": "Having previously worked in the restaurant business, I am appalled by the terrible customer service I received tonight. I called ahead an order and was quoted a 30 minute wait time. No big deal. I got there in 30 minutes on the dot. I paid for my meal and was handed my salad, and then I sat down and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  After having sat there for 15 minutes I put my salad back in the refrigerator on my own accord.  After I had sat there another five minutes, bringing my total time in restaurant at this point to 20 minutes and my time since call in  to 50 minutes, I then asked to speak to the manager.  The manager then went back into the kitchen and checked for a bunch of orders because they were \"running behind\" due to a \"kitchen shortage\". That's restaurant speak for we forgot about you.  Magically a whole rush of call in orders appeared for me and my new found friends who are also waiting in misery.  The manager was nice enough to give me a business card for $10 off the future order. That would be all find and dandy, until I got to my car. At this point, I decided to check the order that he just handed me. Wouldn't you know it one of the pasta was literally room temperature. I don't think that it takes 50 minutes to serve me room temperature pasta. I went back inside and told the guy that was completely unacceptable because I did not just spend $40 to have to go home and use my microwave. He asked me if I took it all the way home.  No!  I took it to the parking lot.  No resolution offered just asked me what you want me to do I can have them remake it. At this point it's now been an hour.  An hour!  On what planet do you think that someone would be happy having you just remake their food and waiting and another 30 to 50 minutes?  I told him know that I wanted my money back. He did give me my money back and snatched up my bag of cold food. I told him I wanted it back because I know that they can't reserve it. I told him I need to go home to feed my kids and have no choice but to use the microwave for dinner anyway, so it might as well be on that.   Its not my fault you screwed up. Thanks for ruining my night. Needless to say I will not be choosing your establishment in the future unless next time I get hungry I feel like being given a bunch of grief and runaround.",

The rigatony needed a bit more ricotta and mozzarella to be a contender ad there was too much of a watery bottom full of thin sauce underneath the pasta. Maybe it wasn't cooked enough? Still, you get the bread and salad and dish for $8 bucks out the door. Also if you eat 5 meals there, you get one free. Stick to lunch here as the specials cannot be beat.",

My personal favorite is the...hang on a second. My favorite meal at Rigatony's goes something like this:  Glass (or two) of the house Chanti (honestly haven't tried the house white, but they also have a good selection of other wines too); I start with an order of steamed clams (in a wine butter garlic sauce) move on to the house Antipasto Salad with their savory warm ciabatta bread, I order the Capellini Pecatore (clams, mussels and shrimp...ok you may want to go with the Veal with lemon and artichoke if you need the red meat) and finish it all off with an espresso and four layer chocolate hazelnut cake!  Fantastic.  Looking for something a little lighter? You can make an excellant light meal out of the appetizers and antipasto.  Love this place!",

Their fried zucchini is wonderful and we always get the RigaTony pasta, its delicious! Also their Apple Bread Pudding is OUT OF THIS WORLD and if they ever remove if from the menu again my boyfriend vows to picket them. lol That is actually one of the reason's I'm giving them a 5 star. The fact that they listened to their customers who were begging for the Apple Bread Pudding to be put back on the menu shows they actually do care. As long as they keep the apple bread pudding (that my boyfriend would lose a limb for) we'll keep coming back!",

I can honestly say in the 10 years my husband & I have been coming here, we've never had a bad meal and service is always great. We usually order pasta but tried the fish special tonight and my husband said \"this was the best meal we've had this year\". Grilled Barramundi with orzo - delicately seasoned sea bass with sun dried tomato and spinach orzo, there wasn't a morsel left on either plate :-) Highly recommend. Hardly ever have room for dessert, but the tiramisu is delicious.",

A little pricey compared to other Italian eateries around the area (Picazzos,Oregenos,Babbos)   Portions are big, but wish they had half orders to accommodate people with no so much of an appetite.  I wine tasted 3 different red wines before I decided on one. Very accommodating!   Food was very good! I highly recommend the Lasagne it's big enough for two people so I would suggest splitting it.  Overall I give it 4 stars for a great family owned  restaurant. Next time I will come with a bigger appetite! :)",

The bottom-line:  If you go home hungry, its your fault.  They'll do their best to fill you up on bread and salad, but save room cause dinners are huge.  I got the deep dish lasagna with marinara.  Tasty stuff.  There was enough of us that we shared the entire dessert menu.  None of the desserts really stuck out to me.  They were good, though not out of this world.  Servers were friendly and gave us a laundry list of specials to choose from that night.  Very family friendly place as there were kids everywhere the night we went.  Overall, a good decent neighborhood Italian spot with reasonable prices.  Won't knock your socks off, but gets the job done and there's a better than 50/50 chance you'll need a box for your leftovers at the end of your meal.",

To Danya who said that they did not have salad options or gluten free items on the menu - they actually have both and have had for a number of years. You may substitute broccoli or quinoa for regular pasta - this is clearly stated on the menu. Both of these are quite tasty in the various dishes. Love the weekly fish and cannoli specials - their blackberry cannoli was to die for. Service is always good. They are busy so if you don't want to wait make reservations.",

We've celebrated many Birthday's, Mother's Days and other special occasions here. Our whole family loves the food, the atmosphere, and because the portions are huge - leftovers the next day!  The antipasto salad is always fresh with just the right amount of dressing and the crusty ciabata bread a perfect compliment. Everything is homemade and authentic - my favorite is the cheese ravioli with meat sauce. My teenage kids love the pizza and the shrimp scampi.   The service is usually very good, but they can be busy - even on week nights. I would definitely recommend making reservations if possible. I give RigaTony's extra credit for serving dinner till 10 PM - I often work late and most restaurants in the area quit serving at 8:30-9:00. Nice to know there's a comfortable, relaxing place to unwind after a long day.  Pricing is very reasonable for the quality and portions. Highly Recommend!",

Everything from the salad, to the bread, to the appetizers, to the main dishes, it all was fantastic! I had the zucchini for an appetizer, these were delicious, nice and crispy and the batter actually had seasoning so it was quite tasty. For my main dish I split the chicken parmesan and the chicken fettuccini alfredo with my friend. Both dishes were great! Each one cooked to perfection, with very tasty seasoned sauces and nice juicy chicken! The portions at this restaurant are huge, definitely enough to take home for later! I cant wait to go back and try a few other dishes! I had to flip a coin to decide what I wanted to eat this night because I wanted to try so many different things. The only reason this didn't get a 5 star was because the wait time. Waiting to eat here is a little ridiculous. We had a reservation for 7:15 and didn't end up getting seated until 7:45 because we had a party of 9. To me that is not a huge party, but a decent size. To have to wait an extra 30 minutes for a table to eat is no fun. Especially when you have a very active and very hungry 3 year old with you. I am hoping the next time we go without reservations, the wait time isn't as long. Other than that, the staff was very friendly, our waitress was very nice and quick, great decor and kind of a \"homey\" vibe, great place to try!!!

My favorite dish is the rigatoni with meatballs, although I really haven't had a bad dish yet! The antipasto salad and bread that you receive before your meal are delicious as well. My only complaint is that I'm not a huge fan of their cannolis.

So my husband was told about Rigatonys On 2/28/ 2016 we drove 45 min. because he was told that this was an excellent Restaurant. well upon our arrival we observed that the atmosphere had a pleasant smell, people appeared to be friendly. as we were being seated we noticed a dirty plate on our table, the person seating us removed the plate and apologized then I ordered a water with lemon and my husband odered a sprite with lemon. When the Server Kimberly returned to the table she asked my husband if he wanted a refill of sprite, he responded yes and in return she brought him back a water, we had to get a different server to get us the sprite. We then ordered the Calamari as an appetizer, which was good,to thick, Then I ordered my Entree which was shrimp and chicken pasta topped with spinach. The preparation of the meal was not inviting at all and not flavored to please tasted as if everything ran together. I then ordered another dish which had the same flavor different items on the plate. We then ordered our deserets, my husband ordered the apple bread pudding of which they only seved the corner of, and I ordered the cannoli's in which were very smaller than  the ones to order when eating in. When I brought this to Kimberlys attention, she stated that they don't discriminate on the size of cannoli's, when I asked another waitress about the size, he stated that they make them all different sizes and agreed that ones this waitress (Kimberly)served us where alot smaller than the ones I previously seen her bring out to another table. I then became irritated and stated that this was a lesson well learned. although we didn't pay for my portion onf the meal( I threw it awasy as soon as we left the restaurant). My husband still let a 15 dollar tip for poor service, cheap tasting poor food. very disappointed, and sicking to classify this food with Italian food. NEVER will I return to this restuarent nor any other restaurant associated with this name. Bad business once again the waitress has a very bad attitude .  one star for the smell. presentation was not good at all!",

I have been here twice and enjoyed both the Chicken Marsala and the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken. I am not a fan of chain restaurants with all the hustle and bustle and bland food but this small, feel like dinner with family, restaurant is definitely a keeper and I will return over and over again.",

It was a bit tight getting to our table the layout is not the best.  After reviewing the menu we decided to start with the fried zucchini. It came before our bread and salad.  It was decent the breading had good flavor, and I liked the thinner pieces.  Our Salad and bread came. and just a note to the veggies out there, remember to ask for your salad salami free, as it usually includes salami. The Salad was decent bit heavy with the creamy Italian dressing and cheese but good.  For my main dish I went with the salmon pene. The salmon it self seemed to be of a lower quality, it was pre cut to little chunks and a bit over cooked,  the sauce was under the pasta making it messy to toss on the elliptical plate.  The person I was with got the stuffed shells, the ricotta was a bit too creamy for our tastes.   It was a decent filling meal, at a decent price but the quality is not the highest.",

Many chose to go somewhere else because of the wait. Once we got in we were served quickly by Frankie who was highly recommended by an exiting patron. She was very friendly, courteous, and helped answer any questions we may have had. She did not tell us the daily special however, which I would have ordered had I'd known about. We started off with a salad, which was delicious and had a twist. They top their salads with sliced salami. I got calamari for myself and ordered chicken marsala, while my fiance ordered chicken parmesan. I was disappointed with the calamari after the salad. It was pretty typical deep fried and unimpressive. The chicken marsala was very underwhelming as well. It very average, as far as chicken marsalas, go. My fiance enjoyed her chicken parmesan, but admittedly has nothing to compare it to. I wouldn't say my experience was bad, but after the wait the great salad and then fizzling out after that, I would say this place is average at best. I would like to try it again with hopes that this review is wrong, but only the future knows.",

The antipasta salad and ciabatta bread to start was delicious.  My husband and son started off with 1 lbs of steamed clams and the flavor was perfect.  My husband and I both had the spaghetti deluxe and it was steaming hot, really authentic and fresh - it defiantly exceeded our expectations and was as good if not better then our favorite pasta spots.

I recommend making a reservation if you don't want to wait. The Chicken Piccata is probably my favorite dish.  Crispy chicken with a yummy sauce and it comes with a side of pasta.  I usually ask for angel hair with tomato cream sauce. My only complaint is when I ordered chicken on one of my pasta dishes once it was very over cooked.  They apologized and removed the chicken charge from my bill.  They offered to make me a whole new dish if I wanted.  Very accommodating.",

No, our server was able to get me a sandwich at dinner time, and she also got them to make it custom for me too! I got a half meatball / half sausage sandwich. Badabing! That sandwich was amazing! You must try one. The bread they use...I wish every sandwich everywhere used that bread. Mmm!  Also sampled some more items from my dining companions' choices: Eggplant Parmesan = delicious!  Sausage Rigatoni = also very tasty!  This was my second visit to Riga Tony's and I still like it...maybe even more. I still cannot give it 5 stars though because the salad they serve before the meal is sub-par, and the wine we ordered was also pretty bad. Not sure if they actually have a sommelier, but the swill we had to force down was extremely insulting to my taste buds. I'd be happy to send this place some recommendations for tasty, affordable wines if they like; but I don't plan on ordering wine there again.",

So I find myself having a hard time figuring out why I shouldn't give this place 5 stars.  The few complaints others had, I did not experience.  I went in here on a Monday night.  Service: The moment I walked in, 2 attentive ladies (one the official greeter), they were willing to seat me right away at a table, I opted for the bar.  They were friendly and nice.    Kevin I believe was the name of the bartender.  He not only tended bar but took orders for the bar and the whole area out there.  I point this out because even despite that, he was on top of everything, I did not wait any amount of time for anything, and he was friendly and informative.  Asking questions about the menu, he was versed in it and helped me decide even on the sauce to top the lasagna I ordered.  I opted for the sweeter marinara instead of the beef sauce...and oh my was that a good recommendation.  So...that brings us to the food:  I got the lasagna with the sweet marinara sauce.  It all complemented each other perfectly and tasted excellent.  I just finished off the other half I brought home...and like any good lasagna...tasted just as good on reheat as when fresh.  The fresh bread they serve with the meal too...very good.  The drinks...he was on top of it and they too were good.    So again....maybe I'm getting soft....but I can't find any reason whatsoever to dock this place anything.  I enjoyed every interaction I had with their staff...heck...I'd almost go as far as to say I felt welcome there as if I'd walked into someone's home.  The barkeep was on top of the service.  ...and the food was great.  So...5 stars it is.",

We asked to move, but we were told there are no other tables, despite seeing several dirty ones. OK. Looking over the menu, the selections seemed promising. After several minutes, our server acknowledged us and said he'd be right back for our drink orders. Several minutes later he returned, and another several more to get our drinks. This continued thru the evening. Long waits between salad, bread and entres. For dimner, I requested my chicken parm with light sauce. When it was brought out, I couldn't see the food there was so much sauce poured on it. The server said he would get another order of the side pasta, if I wanted, nothing about the drowned chicken. 15 minutes later someone passed by the table (I say passed because she didn't even slow down) and dropped down a dish of plain pasta, no sauce this time. The chicken parm appeared to have been deep fried and cold in the center. Not really edible. We next saw our server with the check.To conclude, our server all but ignored us, and didn't listen when taking our orders. The food was near to inedible. Not worth the time or money. This place needs a lot of improvement.",

I will say that the very very little scoop of real mashed potatoes with my Marsala was very good. Very little scoop.  The next day I finished my meal of chicken Marsala, and fettuccine Alfredo. I would guess the chicken weighed no more than 6oz that came in two pieces. I added more Marsala wine the second day because I couldn't even taste it originally. The Alfredo, I had to add more cheese and seasoning as it was devoid of flavor. I tasted the cannoli dessert and found it gritty.... granulated sugar? And not powdered in ricotta? Idk. I threw out the other one and 8/10 of the one  I tasted.  Now... I got 1 chicken Marsala, 1 fettuccine Alfredo and 1 order cannoli and it was $40.27? Or close to that. Does that seem right? Idk. I love their lasagna but I can get that good at several places. There is nothing that stands out here except the excellent greeting I got when I walked in which is why I gave 3 instead of just 2 stars. But hey.... they are always packed.

    "text": "Rigatony's usually has great food! Tonight we met up with a group of people and my son and I ordered the fettuccine alfredo for our entrees. There was sooo much sauce that we barely even ate any of it! I haven't eaten here in a while, but I don't ever remember there being so much sauce on the pasta. There was a significant amount on top, so I thought it wasn't too bad until I stirred the noodles together and saw the amount of sauce that was already mixed in! Gross and such a disappointment! \"Can I have a side of noodles with my sauce\" was my thought...The antipasto salad was amazing and the service was great. I never send food back at a restaurant so I'll just suck this one up and order the baked rigatoni next time!",

Service on the other hand is hit or miss , especially if you sit at the tables at the bar good luck finding anyone to serve you, last Saturday we sat their for over 20 min till we got greeted and it's not like multiple people passed us and saw us looking around.",

    "text": "I had a pretty bad experience here. Used to come here growing up so sad to have a bad experience after coming back vegan. We came for a family meal for my brother's birthday. One server was really nice and when I asked if the bread had egg or milk he brought me out separate bread and a separate salad without cheese. This was great and I really appreciated how thoughtful the server was. The rest of my experience did not go like this. When I order my main meal I had a different server who got really irritated that I had restrictions and was vegan. He kept offering me gluten free and when I asked about the pizza dough he didn't get back to me. He never got back to me on if my order had dairy or egg and stopped coming by our table. When he brought out my order and I asked again if it had dairy or eggs in it. He asked and it turned out there was dairy in it. He offered to see if I wanted something else but at this point the server was being pretty passive aggressive and clearly didn't want to interact with me so I didn't feel comfortable ordering something else. I stuck with my bread and salad and picked up food on my way home. The rest of the group enjoyed their meal, this just isn't a good place to come if you're vegan. I've never had a problem with other Italian restaurants and usually find something to eat. Was not happy with the service, will not be coming here again.",

    "text": "My husband and I were having a few rough days and we paused to grab dinner at RigaTony's. When the hostess asked how we were, I figured I better give her fair warning and I let her know we were crabby. She was immediately concerned and expressed her hope that dining at RigaTony's would remedy that situation. We told her to assign us to some wait staff she didn't like and she laughed and gave us to the gal who was standing at the hostess desk with her (FJ). We apologized that we got dumped on her and despite our insistence that we were crabby, she stated she thought we were going to be a fun table. We had only eaten at RigaTony's one other time, so I don't know if it's normal for them to bring samples of wine, but when our waitress brought us samples, the story I told myself is that she was doing it to try to help our mood. When we declined, without specifically mentioning we were recovering alcoholics, she merely dropped it and did not try to push it on us. She was pleasant and attentive throughout our meal and did not avoid us as a self-centered individual might with a couple that flat-out declared themselves cranky. In fact, she even brought us a dessert on the house. We could not believe it. Now, despite the fact that my husband was too stuffed to fully enjoy the dessert and that I don't eat desserts, we still really appreciated the thought and the whole experience improved our moods substantially. Now, I think the food was also delicious, but this trip, I was much more focused on the stellar service we were given on a night that we desperately needed it and certainly didn't deserve it.",

    "text": "Two nights ago, I went to dinner at Rigatony's, an elegant Italian restaurant in Tempe. When I first arrived, I could not tell whether I liked the look of the building or not. It didn't look very \"cultural\", but as I went inside and started looking around I noticed it; I noticed all the beautiful Italian paintings and the plethora of family oriented pictures on the walls. It was all so inviting and uplifting. My party and I were then seated at a private dining room, secluded from the rest of the restaurant. We were waited on by a couple of servers throughout the night.  They were all very nice and attentive.   The service was on point and that really made the night more enjoyable. The first thing that was brought out was bread. Now, you are probably reading this thinking how simple; little do you all know that this bread was hands down the best bread I have ever had! The seasoning on top of the bread was so delicious and the bread itself had a great density to it. To be honest, I ate like 4 pieces of bread. The salad was the next item to come. Now, I didn't actually eat any salad, but my friends did and they all said, \"It was yummy!\"  Hopefully, you can take their word for it.   Lastly, our five different dishes came out.  All of the plates were steaming hot; filling the room with the aroma of Italy, instantaneously.  I myself ordered the seafood fettuccini.   I didn't really know if I would like it that much when I placed my order, but boy was I wrong. This pasta was so sensational, that every bite I took, I smiled with glee. The temperature was great, the noodles were well cooked, and the fish was prepared phenomenally. I would recommend this dish to any of my friends, family, or acquaintances. Upon entering the restaurant, I was not immediately convinced that Rigatony's would be the cultural experience I was looking for, but it ended up being a culturally diverse restaurant, that everyone enjoyed.  I will be going there again soon, and so should you.",

We've been eating at Olive Garden a lot, mostly because I get $25 gift cards thru work. Having gone to RigaTony's, it will definitely be the go to place when we are dining solely on our dime and want a nice dinner and salad. It is well worth the slightly higher cost per menu item.  I got the chicken with lemon and artichoke...yum.  I love their house salad.  One of my bunco buddies always gets that salad when it's her turn to host.  Hubbie liked the bread (and the salad).  The hubbie got the lasagna and enjoyed it...until later in the evening when he had some major acid reflux.  Getting older sucks.

This time, I knew there was salami in the salad so I asked for a small one without.  It didn't seem to be a problem and I got a pretty big bowl.  Another table over there were a couple of vegetarians too, and they asked as well.  I guess I'm selfish in that I'd like the salad with no salami.    I went with the spaghetti marinara, boring I know, and thought the sauce was too sweet.  I like a more spicy sauce.  Everyone else seemed happy with their meals though.  Service was slow.  And our poor waitress seemed overworked.  She was literally hustling around, and it didn't help that she forgot a few things.    They're moving to a new location, and I'll probably be there at least once to check it out.  For carb loading next year, we'll head somewhere else.",

I'm hitting broken record level here, but the oft-repeated \"Olive Garden but better\" is pretty accurate. Good Italian-American fare with a large, varied menu. Special requests don't scare them, the service is great, and the food is tasty and hot whether you're dining in or taking out. A lot of places just dump your food into containers; Rigatony's packages everything carefully so it stays its best and an appropriate temperature. (And they fill your salads so full the takeout boxes hardly close.)  The salad is damn near the best salad ever, and if you don't save room for dessert you're really missing out.   BEWARE THE PARKING. Rigatony's is packed just about every night for dinner and packed to the gills on weekends. If you're driving a large vehicle (or just aren't comfortable in cramped lots), consider parking on the street. It's a decent neighborhood, and there's enough activity I don't think I've ever heard of anyone getting broken into.",

    "text": "First - this is not a chain restaurant. Check out their website and you will learn that this is a locally owned business that has been in the valley for years. They used to be located in Chandler but moved to Tempe not too long ago. I have to say I'm pretty shocked by the negative reviews because this place is so good and the line out the door and typical 45 minute wait on weekend nights pretty much sum it up. And I don't think it's because we are \"fools\" who like \"garbage?\" Ouch.  Antipasto salad is offered before your meal - and it is yummy! They also offer you a shot of wine which is a practice I'm glad they have continued over the years. The baked Rigatony is like crack - it will melt in your mouth and is a must have. The tomato cream sauce is also to die for. Be sure to get there early or call ahead if you try this place on a weekend night, the place does get busy! My husband and I just ate their Monday night and we did not have a wait, but every table was full.",

    "text": "RigaTony's has become a staple restaurant in our family.  Italian is synonymous with RigaTony's here.    When we have guests from out of town (and I grew up in an Italian communitty so all of my relatives are darn picky about their Tally food) EVERYONE requests that we go to that \"great Italian place\" with the great food.  We have local family that will drive down to the East Valley from Anthem, just to join us for dinner at Riga Tony's.    I cannot think of one thing that I or my family has eaten here that was not superb.  We have had Chicken Marsala (which I won't eat anywhere else), spaghetti and meat sauce/meatballs, Alfredo, Stuffed Shells, Lasagne, and their famous Baked Rigatony.    As a note, to anyone going for the first time...order the fried ravioli, if your cholesterol can handle it.  It is AMAZING!!!    Additionally, service at RigaTony's has always been top tier, in my book.  Even our most picky guests delight in the level of service we get there.    This food is clearly not commercial and the restaurant has a somewhat simple spin on family Italian. Their pasta is always perfection and the sauces are consistently terrific.",

ALWAYS, consistently good (if not great). I always order the fried ravioli appetizer,  either as my meal or as tonight, as an app, since the special sounded to good to pass up. The special was linquine with shrimp, scallops, mushrooms and spinach with a vodka cream sauce. It was outstanding. I judge an Italian restaurant by the bread. Rigatony's sets the standard. I have never had better. (That is why I say Olive Garden sucks; nasty white bread sticks as well as average salad!) Speaking of salad, they know what a real Italian salad is here; lettuce (romaine and red leaf), red onion, genoa salami, mozz cheese, black olives, tomatoes and yummy Italian dressing to top it off. I have had many different menu items over the years and they are all tasty, especially the lasagna. Happy manga!",

We went on a Saturday, and we had the $6.95 lunch specials in which you can choose from any of the specials that run M-F. You get a nice size meal with salad and their yummy Ciabatta bread. The server was very friendly.   I took my husband there a week later for dinner on a weeknight. Again I choose the patio which was even more cozy at night. My only grunt to the evening meal was it was a but pricy, but the quality and the service made it worth the while. The portions were big and we each had leftovers for lunch. Will defitnitely be back, the food is really good and so far the service has always been great too!",

Granted, I have only had their delish salad, bread, lasagne and baked rigatoni with sausage, but the place rocks it every single time we go down there.   The salad is fantastic, and the baked bread is always hot and fresh.   But the star of the show is their Baked Rigatoni with sausage. And I mean the star of the show! Layers of rigatoni, creamy bechamel sauce cradled with marinara and thinly sliced italian sausage topped with melted mozzerella cheese, all served piping hot. It's THE BEST I've ever eaten!   The only drawback is the lack of a second location in Scottsdale, but we'll continue to make the drive because it's that good.   The staff are always very nice, and the food is promptly served.  If you haven't tried Rigatony's, and you love Italian food, get in your car and go!! It's worth the drive from anywhere!",

We went there last night well before closing, and the hostess sat us in the very back booth of the restaurant, which is fine. However, there were no other diners around us, and no traffic whatsoever besides those using the nearby restroom. We sat there for 10 minutes with absolutely no waiters or waitresses in sight the entire time. We ended up leaving, of course. To top it all off, the hostess was so completely oblivious, she actually wished us a cheerful good night on our way out, despite the fact that she had literally just shown us to our table minutes beforehand.  This is not an isolated incident. Previous visits during lunch with coworkers have also resulted in a similar lack of service and organization. No matter how good the food is, it is not worth it. And the food is very good, I'll give them that -- that is, if and when you can get them to actually bring you some. Farewell, Rigatony's (until you get your act together).",

I went to the bar and thought I'd have a quiet and quick meal to avoid looking out of place. I was amazed on how welcoming and at home I felt by the bartenders. Chris and Trisha were a pleasure to talk to and sold me on the special. Chris asked about my work and made light conversation. I thought this was just an act he does for every guest, but then some regulars, I'm assuming, came in and sat next to me. He talked to them like he's known them for years. He introduced me to them and we started talking. I was there for 2 hours, but it seemed like 30 min. All this and they were very busy. You don't get service like this anymore. Great job.

    "text": "My husband works close to this restaurant and had heard good things about Rigatony's from his coworkers. I came down to meet him for lunch, and he suggested this place.  I had read the reviews before coming, and have to admit I was a bit leery to try it out after seeing the 1 star review from 4/21/15 but decided to check this place out anyhow.  They were incredibly busy when we got there at 12:00 noon, and there was a 5 min wait, but we were seated in a roomy booth. The fact that they were this busy seemed like a positive sign.   I have to say that I liked the food. The server was very friendly, and apologetic that she was a titch late in getting our drinks to us since they were busy. Our meals came with this delicious house salad that included finely sliced up salami, pepperccinis, lettuce, onion, mozzarella cheese and olives with their specially made salad dressing. In addition to the salad, we were given this bread with a delicious herbed crust. The server placed some olive oil and some oregano on a plate, and told us to dip our bread in it. Nom, nom, nom. I'd come back for that bread alone.  I ordered the cappelini pescatore, which for $13.95, had a generous amount of seafood for the price. It was a huge serving and after filling up on bread, I had to take 1/2 of it home. My husband ordered the Italian sausage hoagie, which was gloriously covered in melted mozzarella, and also split his meal. For the price, it was definitely steal. It was HUGE. You could definitely share this with someone. Per the menu, they charge $3.00 if you decide to split an entree.   For dessert, we had the cannolis. The shells were nice and crispy while the filling was rich and comforting. We took one home, and froze it. We were told by the server not to put it in the fridge because it would get too soggy if we didn't eat it tonight.   If I'm in the area, I'll definitely be back. It's not worth driving for, as I've had better Italian, but if I'm in the area I'd definitely come back. This is a family run business, and I definitely prefer Mom and Pop shops over chains.",

Their marinara sauce is on the sweeter side, which is the way I like it. Their bread is good too. I've had better antipasto. Only three stars because I eat homemade italian food all the time. I'm sure if italian food wasn't overkill for me I would give it 5 stars.",

    "text": "We were misguidedly sent here for Valentine's Day, not realizing it was a shopping center-Olive Garden type of place. We love Italian so decided to give it a try. The atmosphere was pretty awesome, great interiors. We did have a reservation but we still had to wait about 15 minutes on a Sunday night at 6. I can't speak for all their staff, but our waitress took about 10 minutes to get us waters, at which point we order wine, which took her about 20 minutes to get to us. Ordered entree and appetizers, which the appetizers came out approximately 5 minutes before the entrees. I am a pescatarian and when I asked for a house salad with no meat, she was very rude. The food was just ok, my only complaint is that I ordered the seafood bake, which was not baked, it was just a MASSIVE pile of pasta with 4 tiny scallops, 3 shrimp, and a few flakes of some unknown whitefish. Misleading name, almost no seafood and it wasn't cheap. (Calamari app was excellent.) WORST PART OF THE EXPERIENCE: They have giant portions so I took most of my meal home. The waitressed boxed everything in the kitchen for me, and when I ate some the next day, there were shards of broken beer bottle in my food. :( I'm sure the boxes were sitting behind the bar and someone had an accident and she just didn't notice them but...it was pretty awful.",

I tried linquine with marinara and shrimp - the sauce was perfect. My husband had the creamy clam sauce with spaghetti and said it was the best dish he 'ever' had!! The bread and antipasto salad is to die for. You can buy a loaf of bread to bake at home! another plus! The ambiance is wonderful, the service is amazing! If you want to be treated like family and enjoy a delicious 'real italian' meal then this is the place for you.  I never said these words before but its 'better than my Moms and Grandma's food)!  I hope the sky doesent open up and swallow me now!!!",

    "text": "Me and my friend were looking for a place to eat that was fairly cheap before I drove her to the airport.  Her Grandmother suggested RigaTony's.  She said it was a decent price for what you got.  She was more than right.  The exterior looked quaint as we drove into the parking lot.  The moment we walked in, the smell of italian food comsumed our senses.  They offered lunch specials from $6.95 and only $1.00 more for a drink.  The specials came with amazing bread and matching house antipesto salad.  Yummy!  I ordered their chicken parmigiana, which can only be described as \"explode in your mouth flavor.\"  This was hands down the best chicken parm dish I had ever had.  My friend had the stuffed shells, which was surprisingly delish (not my fave thing to eat via italian), however the seasonings and sauce made it anything but dull.  The service we recieved was ok.  Our waiter wasn't super attentive.  He may have come to our table once after taking our order. I had to flag him down for refils on our drinks, and even that took a little bit of time.  I recommend  this restaurant.  It's well worth my drive from Goodyear to Chandler.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place.  We have been looking for reasonable Italian food not too far from our house.  Unfortunately, in the end we decided we did not like it enough to go back.  We had the take out chicken picata special.  The bread was strange, not bad but not italian and certainly not ciabatta.  I liked the salad alot.  It it an antipasto salad so it has lots of things in it like pepperoncini.  You have to like that type of salad to enjoy this. Canned black olives did not help it. The fetuccini alfredo was terrible.  It tasted strongly like nutmeg.  When I taste something like that it tells me they did not use good enough ingredients to let it stand on its own.  I have had real Alfredo at Alfredos of Rome in Miami Beach.  Whicle I don't expect that quality of food here, the real stuff it very delicate and rich - butter cream and real parmagian cheese, nothing else.  The chicken picata was good as long as you did not expect chicken picata.  It had no lemon in it.  It was a nice dish, breaded chicken with mushrooms, capers, tomatoes etc, but it definely was not chicken picata.  Desert was chocolate haselnut cake.  It probably is very good if you like chocolate and coffee together.  neither of us like this.  So out of every thing we got, the chicken was OK, but not what it was supposed to be and the salad was good for that type of salad.",

    "text": "First review of 2014.  Real Southern Italian cuisine is to be found here in spades.  While it seems to have something of the retro vibe that Oregano's has, this place is not a chain, and the ambiance here is more of an Italian home during the 40s and 50s instead of a restaurant with random antiques hung on the walls, ceiling, etc.  Not only does it look like an Italian-American home during that time, it tastes and smells like it too.  The recipe for the sauce no doubt has roots in the old country, and I'm certain someone's Nonna came over from Palermo a century ago with that recipe in her head.  The meat sauce has a sweet, spicy taste.  Fantastic, but as my family is Zeneize and Toscano, it's a distinctly different flavor from what I am used to.  My wife and I were very happy with our meal, but I have to be in the mood for food from the lower half of the Boot to want to come here again.  When that moment strikes, I'll be ready to return for some lasagne or a pizza.  Thanks RigaTony's for a delicious lunch!",

It was quite flavorful, albeit the broth was a bit too salty for my liking. Even the bread wasn't enough to cut the salt. (One star off for that.)   My server was Jessica and she was helpful and very sweet. I like this place! I'd totally spend my own money to eat here. (I'm here on business in PHX.)",

Second, we had a top notch waitress named Jess S.  Her smile alone was infectious but her knowledge of the menu made choosing much easier.   We started with antipasto.  It was knock-your-socks-off-oh- my-God-bring-me-more good.  It was served with fresh baked bread which we both rated as a four.  We passed on a second round of antipasto to enjoy cheese ravioli (my wife's choice) while I ordered the Capellini Pescatore:  clams, mussels, shrimp, and calamari steeped in a white wine butter sauce with a hint of tomato over angel hair pasta.  My wife rated her meal as a 5 star production.  I gave mine a 4 star rating but it was only because I felt it needed a bit of a garlic kick to it.  But maybe that's just me.  Would I go back? Absolutely, but it's a long drive from Indy for lunch. :-(   I wonder if they deliver...to Indiana?",

The favorite part for me is the whole wheat pasta, which is been hard to find lately.  There's also a quinoa pasta.  The Italian soda is a special treat!  The best deal is to go for the Early Bird Special, which is pasta, salad, and either meat or a vegetable at a very low price.  I think it ends at 4:00pm during the week.

The fettuccine alfredo was great, its exactly what I would expect of the dish and as for the spaghetti it was also great. Portions were perfect in my opinion.   The atmosphere was a little on the loud side, where we sat the tables were rather close together so I could hear the conversations of those sitting next to us really well. Made it kind of hard to focus on my dinner companion. It feels homey but a little outdated.   Overall we will definitely be back and I will be taking my parents when they come to town to visit.

I have to say that Rigatony's did a phenomenal job putting together all the wonderful dishes and salads to eat. From the moment we walked in to pick up the food, they took very good care of us and a parade of servers brought all the food to our car. The food was amazing and it was gone very quickly. I had about 40 people and they loved every dish. RigaTony's is the best. Outstanding!! Thanks to everyone at Rigatony's,The Klein's...",

    "text": "Hmm.. well, this left me a little confused. Maybe not good enough for four stars but slightly better than three. It is a typical old school New York style Italian restaurant, as it is apparent from the name. The decor is dated but I think that is intentional, which is cool. We were a large party of 12 and our waitress was pretty good with the service. They brought out the bread and salad and they were quite great. They were incredibly fresh and who doesn't like whole black olives in their salad? Seriously.   We started placing our orders and after about 20 minutes of deliberation, I decided to get the Baked Rigatoni with chicken. I thought the sauce was pretty great with abundant garlic.. just the way I like it. The chicken however, left much to be desired. I found myself trying to eat all of the chicken as quickly as possible to get it out of the way so that I don't accidentally take a bite of the pasta with chicken in it. I don't know how it would've tasted with sausage or shrimp, but I would just stick to the pasta with absolutely no meat in it, if I were to return. One of my friends ordered meatballs and she absolutely hated it. She thought the sauce was too sweet and ended up barely eating any of what she ordered. The rest of the party, however,  seemed to enjoy their food.   I thought it was alright overall.. not terribly disappointing, neither was it a memorable meal. Undecided at this point if I would return.",

Move to South West Phoenix came a couple of times in the last couple of years still remember the same my wife and I visit this place back on last Friday and the menu changed just a little bit some of the hidden items that we used to get you can still ask for they're just not listed on the menu service was great and Grand there was a wait so expect that don't get disappointed it's worth the way the food is always on point as much as I remember the first time I came here. Make sure you give rigatony's a try authentic close enough to Italian food that you're going to get in Arizona.",

So it's with a heavy heart that I have to say we will never be back. We know Friday and Saturday are their busiest nights so we got there at 4:30pm. Only 10 minute wait. Great! It was downhill rapidly from there. Service was horrendous. Waited for 15 minutes to order our drinks, okay, no biggie. I ordered coffee. It was stone cold when it came out. I mean it wasn't even slightly warm. I put my finger in it just to make sure. Not any warmth to it. Waited another 10-15 minutes for the waiter to come take our food order and that's when I let him know about the coffee. Another 15 minutes for salad and bread. Also the new cup of coffee, huh? Warm but definitely not hot coffee. Didn't feel like dealing with it so took 2 sips and then drank water. The salad in the past was something of heaven. This was NOT! A clump of grated cheese strands and antipasto meats stuck together. Yuk. To top it off, since it took so long to bring out our food, meaning we had to ask for our food after 30 minutes, cold ravioli and cold pizza. Wth? When we let the waiter know, he went to get the manager. By this time we were so pissed off. The manager said he would make it again. Um, no, we're not going to wait another 30 minutes. He then said again, let me make it right. Sorry but there was no way to make it right at this point. Poor guy, after he said that, we didn't even give him a chance to speak. He just left us. He returned after a few minutes to say he was taking it off the bill. Try the whole meal buddy! You guys got nothing right!!! While trying to salvage the ravioli dinner by eating it cold, is when we found 2 of them were brown on the bottom. They we old!! Stale and old. Omg. If this is how they are going to serve food now, I'm not going back!!!!",

This place has AMAZING service and phenomenal food. The portions are huge and the flavor is even bigger!  Every meal is served with bread and salad. I can do without the bread but the salad was a meal in itself. It has lettuce, tomatoes, onions, peppers, salami, olives, and this homemade creamy balsamic vinaigrette. I tried the jambalaya pats for my entree and I was blown away. It is bow tie pasta with peppers, shrimp, chicken, sausage, and shrimp. It is seasoned to perfection with just enough kick.  I get to enjoy all this yummy goodness with amazing staff. My waitress checks on me just enough. I don't feel deserted and I don't feel overwhelmed. Speaking of dessert. I'll be back later to tell you about it because I'm about to devour it hahah!",

We've celebrated most anniversaries, birthdays, family events(in the private room) and tonight was somewhat of a disappointment  It was a significant Birthday for me (not disclosing!) and it fell very short.  Our reservation was at 730pm and we were seated within 10, awesome!  We sat out on the patio which was lovely but were never given menus.  Our server finally came and asked if we were ready to order but we still needed menus, so she took our drink orders, but we waited about 15 min for that, there were only 3 tables occupied outside.  We finally ordered, bread, salad everything was great.  At the end of the meal I told our server I have 3 cards stamp cards and can she combine, she said let me see.  When she came back she said we could use them next time,  it that didn't make sense since we had combined over 3 cards of stamps into one and a half cards of stamps! It only takes 1 card to take advantage of a free entree! I got the impression she felt like it would hurt her tip, which it would not have since I'm in the service industry.  I was charged the most I've ever been charged for shrimp scampi, due to a sub of wheat pasta, which I've never experienced. I could have ordered their \"Carb smart\" dinner with chicken, shrimp, wheat pasta, and a veggie for over $5 less!  you would think the server would suggest that!  I truly feel like our server was nickel and dimeing us for her benefit.  My big Birthday was never acknowledged, which was fine since Im not a fan of getting older!   Bottom line. Great food as always!  Everything else a disappointment",

They do get busy but we snagged a table in the bar so our wait only ended up being 2 min instead of 45 min for a table. Either would've been worth the wait. Dinner started with the delicious bread and salad and it only got better from there. I had angel haired pasta with scallops and shrimp and they were cooked perfectly. Be warned they're huge portions and unfortunately it was our last night in town so I couldn't take it with me. I will definitely be back when we come to town again and would recommend this to everyone!",

It's quite nice, for me.  So when I got married I decided to go with RigaTony's. I paid the little bit extra to have it delivered and they where on time, helped put food in place, brought everything we needed. The food was amazing, my guests loved it. My food was perfect!!! Thank you.",

    "text": "I suspect their is always a wait for a table. We went on a Sunday night ar 7:45, saw many people waiting and were told we would have anywhere from 45 min to an hour before we would be seated. Maybe it was because it was a cold night and only 1 couple braved the temperature rather than waiting?  They did have infrared heaters, but it was rather chilly even with that. When we were seated we were greated by a friendly server, and were told to peruse the menu while she got our salad and breadsticks ( they come with the meal). When we inquired about the dressing, she told us there was raw egg in it.  To me, that can be risky- some raw eggs can have salmonella, though the egg industry has cleaned up their process over the last few years. But why take the chance?  We selected a different dressing just to be cautious. Other than that issue, we had a good meal. Everyone else other than me is ordered pasta dishes, and thought they weres delicious. I ordered the single pork chop with a side of pasta.  I agree the pasta and sauce were delicious, but the pork chop was tough. I was able to eat half of it buy slicing each bite very thinly. I would not order that again",

Our waiter Dillon took our order and delivered it in a reasonable amount of time.  He auctioned off our food not knowing who had what.  I ordered pasta with veggies and got my veggies when I was finished eating ten minutes later.  I also asked for extra sauce and didn't get that either when my food was delivered.  Why bother writing down the order in the first place?  He didn't do a check back to make sure everything was ok either. Won't stop us from returning though.  We just won't sit in his station again!",

    "text": "After being a loyal customer for over 20 years, sadly we won't be back. The food is wonderful, the management, not so much.  I had made a reservation for the private dining room for a birthday dinner. We moved out of state a few years ago, but still continue our tradition of going to Rigatony's for all of our special occasions. We got to the restaurant along with all of our local family and were told that we would be seated in the regular dining area.   Apparently, the girl who made the reservation made an error and gave me a time for the private room that wasn't available. I asked to speak to the manager and it went downhill from there. Bryce came out with an attitude, was unapologetic, and made no attempt to make anything right. Note at the time, there was no party in the private dining room and wouldn't be for another hour. He rudely told me that we could sit in the regular dining area or leave. When I mentioned we had been customers for years, he made a smart aleck response.  Even though our experience in the main dining area vs. the private room would not have been what we wanted (it's way too loud to have large group conversations in the main room), we would have stayed had he not been so condescending and rude.   I tried to call the restaurant several times that evening to speak to Chrissy, the owner. I kept getting a recording to call back later. I ended up sending Chrissy an email about our experience and received no reply.  Rigatony's has gotten so popular over the years that apparently customer service is of no importance to them. We ended up leaving that evening and going to a restaurant that actually appreciates their customers.",

All you can eat bread and salad if your server remembers to bring it to you after you remind him twice (never did get it).

I come here becuase I actually crave huge plates of fried zucchini fries and a side of their pesto ranch.   Oh, and be careful not to totally ruin your dinner because they serve bread here too. Amazing, hot out of the oven bread with Italian seasonings and lots of butter. This is a rough place to visit if you're an emotional eater or craving carbs or PMSing or all of the above.  Service can be hit or miss, but usually it's pretty average. Depending on when you visit there might be a wait, though it's a pretty large dining area and the turn around time is decent. I know this is an Italian restaurant I've never actually had their pasta - my go to is the salmon salad with the pesto ranch. It is definitely not a healthy salad, so if that's what you are wanting, have them put the dressing on the side.. they are very generous with it!",

Their lunch specials can't be beat. They have a \"create your own pasta\" deal for $7.95 and the regular lunch menu is extremely reasonable as well. My boyfriend almost always orders the chicken Parmesan ciabatta sandwich even though they took it off the menu a year ago. They are always willing to make it for him. Our meals also come with salad and bread so we get out of there for under $30 for lunch for two people and that's before the discount for being a frequent diner. It's a great value. You could easily pay the same or more elsewhere and not get salad and bread included. Did I mention the bread is freshly baked? It's the best if you get lucky enough to get it while it's still warm from the oven.   Dinner is always busy. We've come in at 5 and seen a line on a weeknight. Forget about eating here on a holiday without a reservation! We came here for lunch on Father's Day and it was an hour wait! (I'm telling you so you plan ahead. I'm glad RigaTony's is so busy because that means it'll be open for as long as I want to keep eating there.) We've only been here for dinner a couple times but we've always had a good time. The sangria is amazing! The baked Rigatony is my go to for dinner. I wish they had a veggie lasagna. Their drink prices are very reasonable so we've never broken the bank having dinner here.   They have a lovely patio with heaters if it's cold. My boyfriend took me here when we first started dating and I felt like we were in this little intimate cafe.   The waitstaff has always been courteous and friendly. We usually sit in the bar if we can and Tracy remembers that I like Dr. Pepper and always asks us if we need menus when we sit down. (We usually don't because we have the menu memorized.)   They also do takeout and sometimes if we want a light dinner we order salad to go and a few appetizers. They have two takeout parking spots so pickup is a breeze.   If you haven't been here yet, you should make plans to go!!",

Food was ok except for my eggplant, two small rounds of eggplant extremely under cooked so it was tough, tasteless and chewy. But the real kicker? My daughter really wanted to go there before she gives birth next week so she could indulge in the cappuccino pie for dessert. But they didn't have any because someone walked in and purchased 4 whole pies and they had none left to sell to their patrons. You know, those people who came in and spent a good $100 plus on tasteless food. If someone needs 4 pies, that should be a special order item. What kind of a place sells all of their desserts to one person leaving none for their diners to order? A place that doesn't care about the people eating in their establishment.",

After perusing the weird items at the adjacent Tuesday Morning as we were waiting for a table, we eventually got a seat on the patio, some of the only people to brave the chilly 70 degree evening in Arizona. We got calamari, the capellini pescatore, and the baked rigatoni. All the main dishes come with their antipasti salad and ciabatta bread. Now, my home town is largely Sicilian and I lived in Italy for a bit. Rigatony's is super solid, homey Italian American food. It's like what Macaroni Grill should be with a bit more soul and liberal use of garlic. The marinara sauce for dipping or on the pasta has a nice kick of fresh garlic, the ciabatta was delicious, and I hoovered down my rigatoni with ultimate ease. My partner in dining/life and I both agreed this would go in our rotation for easy comfort food. We're fans.",

There was also sufficient amount of eggplant that was given. Definitely quality italian food.   Our server was also really great!

I was super disappointed that the restaurant did not have a lot of low calorie or gluten free options.  They don't even have a salad section on the menu.    I ordered the chicken with lemon, artichoke and capers with out the breading.  Of course it came out with breading.  The cutlet was chewy and lacked flavor.... Actually i'm not sure about the flavor considering the sauce was overwhelmed by the watery marinara sauce that came on my side dish of spaghetti.  Overall the meal was disappointing.  So bummed!

My only tip, is that if you go on a holiday or weekend get a reservation or plan on waiting like an hour. Waiting is a good thing people, it shows you how good the food is. Also, I always ask for some of their salad to go. That stuff is addicting! My favorite dishes so far are the spaghetti with 1 big meatball and their lasagna.",

I ordered the baked rigatoni and my boyfriend had spaghetti with sausage and Sicilianized it (capers, onions, pepper, and anchovies). We also had the bread and salad that come with the entrees. Everything came out promptly. The food was probably 4 stars, but the speediness and customer service made it 5 stars. Our server had brown curly hair (I think her name was sandy). She was so sweet and made great recommendations. She also took care of everything we needed, without hovering over us. I highly recommend that if you come to Rigatony's, ask to sit in Sandy's section!",

I have to say that the last time I ordered it, it was not cooked as well as usual, but that won't stop me from getting it again.

It was invariably thought well done by all.  Even the waif like girls at our table finished their pasta.  I had the chicken parmesan which was good.  The marinara sauce a sweet version missing some of the garlic flavor and depth I am used to but very good in its own fashion.   We finished with coffee and canoli. The canoli were sweet and creamy with a softer texture than I am used to but very good none the less. The coffee was good but missing the strong espresso like flavor i am used to at \\ authentic Italian restaurants in the U.S..

We got in, in about 10 minutes, The restaurant smelled great, we had an excellent server who is super nice, and the food was great. I got the cheese ravioli and you could tell it was made there, didn't taste like it was ever frozen. My boyfriend got something with clams and shrimp and he ate every bite of it. The servings are large but not ridiculous, the prices were great. Meals also come with a bunch of fresh bread and a very great salad, with meats and it pepperchinis and some delicious dressing that I can't quite put my finger on.The vibe in the whole place was like very homey, they have roundtables and booths. You could either go there with a group of friends, on a date, or like we did, take your kids. I live on the other side of town but I would definitely go back there, very clean, very nice stuff, And the menu has just about something for everybody,",

The short ribs and seafood dishes are delicious, but we always seem to wander back to their signature baked rigatony with sausage. The antipasto salad is one of the top restaurant salads and the patio is lovely during the spring. They also regularly support community agencies like Paz de Cristo, and their generosity is what spurred us to seek them out. We are so happy we did!",

The side salad had salami strips, grated cheese, sliced onion, black olive, pepper, tomato and probably a bunch other things, it is loaded, and comes with lots of dressing.

The servers are also very aloof, not offering much in the way of advice when ordering but that could have been due to how busy they were.

The tomatoes were slimy and it was drowning in dressing. Than our food came out, and I could barely get through meal. It didn't even look appetizing, the Alfredo was dried out and the chicken was too tough to cut through.

    "text": "I should start out by saying I have worked in the restaurant industry all my life. It takes a lot to impress me. From the moment we got out of our car - the place was busy, and it smelled amazing. We walked in to a friendly hostess who was able to seat us right away.  We sat and looked over the menu for a moment when the manager came over to greet us. I thought it was because maybe our waitress was busy (double sat, getting an order, etc...). She offered us a wine sample and gave us a little history of the restaurant. She also listed out some of the house favorites. I watched the manager as the night went on and realized she greets every table! That is a really nice touch. I also noticed during our meal a busser was cleaning tables near us. He wiped down each condiment shaker, the entire table (didn't miss a spot), and the seats! Thoroughly clean - made me feel good about where I was eating. The server, Asia, came by to take our order - very nice and very hospitable. The service although a little slow was amazing how calm she seemed with a full section and how much personable service we got. She was professional and very good at all the things I look at in a server: clean appearance, genuine smile, multitasked, up-sold, invited us to come back by telling us about lunch specials and giving us a \"punch card\".  Overall, a great price - most pasta dishes are about $12-$16. Each meal came with a salad (better than Olive Garden's) and amazing bread. I had so much trouble picking what I wanted to eat and cannot wait to go back and try everything else. Everything tasted good, looked good, and we left full, happy and a little box of leftovers.  Overall - one of the BEST places I've eaten in the last year! Well done Riga Tony's! I am impressed and recommend anyone who likes food to eat there!",

    "text": "We USED to be RigaTony customers back in the day when they 1st opened their location at Az ave and Knox. Went there for years...until the neighborhood and  RigaTony's quality and service went WAY downhill. It was no big surprise when that location closed. We quit going altogether.  On a whim, (and hoping for the good old days when this place was one of our faves...) we tried their \"new\" location-- at Warner / McClintock-- I guess it has been there about a year+ so I figured that was enough time to get it together.Lucky us, Monday night is \"Kids eat Free\" night. With two toddlers in tow, this was a bonus! Not packed, but kind of busy for a Monday , we were greeted and seated right away. Our server was right on us and got our bev order. She also suggested that she could put the kids order in 1st, so they would not have to wait...great idea. The herb-bread with olive oil for dipping was even better than I remembered. And the antipasto salad included with the meal had generous portions of meat, cheese, tomatoes,onion, peppers, olives with house dressing, was fresh and very good. My wife who is allergic to onions, asked our sever to make her a salad without, and she was very accommodating... Not really sure what to try, I opted for the \"Tour of Rigatony\" plate which included a generous (more than a sample) portion of what I guess is their more popular items:Chicken Picatta, stuffed shells, fettucinni alfredo, and a huge italian sausage ( kind of spicy, to my delight!). This dish is for the hungry appetite...I brought half home; it's a lot of food for $14.95! The wife ordered the Capellini Seafood dish: Clams, mussels, shrimp sauteed in a very light white wine/butter and herb sauce, placed over angel hair pasta. She seemed to really enjoy it. I tasted it and the seafood was fresh and prepared very nicely. It also was a large serving.  We remembered that in the good old days, Rigatony's desserts were awesome, so we ordered the Tiramisou, and chocolate layered cake. These were truly scrumptious!   All in all, it was a wonderful dining experience.... service and food was great! Price was very reasonable for the amount of food...  The Mgr was making his rounds to each table making sure our evening was satisfactory....I related my story as a returning customer, and told him that they have won us back as regulars! The biggest compliment was from our 5 year old: \"This is WAY better than Olive Garden! \"",

I don't really blame the waitress too much, it seemed like they were understaffed (probably the economy).  We would all go back and we enjoyed our food.  A couple things:  My eggplant parm was great again (maybe not quite as good as the first time, but still delicious).  My baby's pasta with butter and garlic and shrimp was kinda tiny, and there were only like 3 shrimp on it (really guys?  you couldn't give her a couple more?), but she said \"It was good, but how can you really fuck up butter and garlic on pasta?\"  I assured her that ANYTHING can be fucked up. :o)  Mom had the shrimp cesar (5 whole shrimp on it!!!), she enjoyed it and the big croutons.    Dom had the mac n cheese, he was too full from our calamari to really enjoy it, but he did have some for dinner and seemed to like it.  We all liked the calamari and I really loved the sauces that came with... marinara and a red pepper sauce (i think).  P.s. I have to agree with Ceci G - that house dressing is the shit!  I swear I said \"I can drink this stuff its so good!\" They should sell it!",

Some of my favorite entrees are the Cannelloni (if you are aren't anti-veal), Stuffed Shells and the Chicken Parm (sub Fettuccini Alfredo).

    "text": "Want to know a secret on how to waste nearly $50 in less than an hour? Come to RigaTony's! My husband and I live right down the street from here and watched as it was being built wondering what it would be. When we found out it was a RigaTony's I became disinterested. I have never eaten here and had no desire to, that is until my husband decided he wanted to try it. He knew it was an italian place and he likes to find new places where he can eat a bowl of pasta. I stalled going here as long as possible but Friday night I finally gave in and we went to dinner here. I think we came in around 6, which I guess is right before the dinner rush because there was no wait, but when we left less than an hour later there was a line out the door. And thank god we didn't have to wait because the people who line up to eat here are total fools.  The service was quick and our waitress was really friendly. That is the only reason this place gets more than 1 star. She was quick to bring us water and take our order. We decided on the portabello cloud as an appetizer, which sounded interesting. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and my husband ordered some seafood with pasta and cream sauce special that was being offered. Salad and bread comes with the meal and luckily I had read before hand that the salad comes with salami so I requested the salad without it. The only way that I can really describe this place is a lower quality Olive Garden. And I hate Olive Garden. The salad is basically the same with lettuce, red onions, tomato, black olives, and peppers, but instead of a decent italian dressing that I can stomach, this one is coated with cheese and a heavy dressing. I barely finished one serving, but I watched as the table across from me (two women and one child) devoured two bowls of it. Ugh. The bread was just ok. Its just bread. Our appetizer comes out and it was not what I was expecting. It was a portabello mushroom filled with cheese and a few smigens of tomato and spinach, deep fried and placed on top of a pool of basil cream sauce. If you don't care about fitting into your pants the next morning, this could be tasty.   Our entrees were the same. Low quality Olive Garden fare. My $12 fettuccine was an embarrassment to the name. I make amazing fettuccine for less than $12 that can feed four people!! Do people actually come here and eat this garbage when you can make so much better at home?? And apparently there is flour in the sauce to make it thicker. Not necessary and made me lose my appetite quite frankly. My husband liked his meal at the restaurant but started to feel sick as we were leaving and we took our leftovers home but they ended up in the dumpster on the way into our house because we couldn't stomach the thought of eating this food again. When we got the bill and our total came to $40 I about passed out. I had to leave the tip in cash because I couldn't stomach the thought of adding more to our credit card. What a complete waste of money. The food was bad. Bad bad bad. Heavy, greasy, everything was covered in cheese or some kind of cream sauce. I hope this experience made my husband realize that food can be so much better. I hardly ate the next day just to counteract the amount of calories I ingested in this meal.  One more note. I know this is a \"family restaurant\", but seriously. If your newborn baby is screaming its head off and the restaurant is full of people, please take the baby outside until it calms down. Its just downright rude when you let the kid scream in a place full of people who didn't come there to listen to your baby scream.",

We were offered samples of wine, antipasto salad table side and a plate of bread. The salad was so good, the strips of salami were unreal and so was the homemade vinaigrette! The bread was sliced and fragrant, no breadsticks here! Olive oil is provided at each table for dipping. My boyfriend ordered the special for the evening (Seafood Linguini) and I ordered the Penne Sausage Rosa. By the time food came out, we were so excited to see huge plates of amazing food in front of us! My pasta was so good, especially the rosa sauce! My boyfriend loved the plentiful amount of scallops in his pasta as well as the shrimp! Of course we couldn't eat all of our food so we took it home to enjoy the next day. We walked out feeling full and all for under $40 (for 2). Next time, I will be ordering more of everything to enjoy table side and at home! Yum yum, would totally recommend!!!",

    "text": "Since I moved to AZ from NY about a year ago, I have been disappointed  by  dozens of AZ restaurants that claim to be \"New York Style\". Not just Italian restaurants. I'm just as disappointed by AZ yelpers who think they know what authentic NY style is. So it was, with trepidation, that I heeded the advice of the reviews previous to this one, and booked a table for ten for a pre theater dinner. Well, you see the five stars. How good is RigaTony ? Lets start with service. We were pretty late for our 4:30 reservation after being stuck in traffic on the 10. They held the table, no problem, on a very busy evening. Even though we ordered our plates after 5 we got the early bird specials and the $3 glasses of wine. Again, not a problem. Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and very efficient. Sodas and waters were refilled without prompting. Sorry, I didn't get her name.  The food. Fresh Chapati comes to the table almost immediately . There are bottles of olive oil and small dishes of freshly chopped garlic too.  Make your own concoction. The early bird pasta dishes offer a good variety of  pasta and accompaniment, are plentiful, tasty and offered in fresh semolina or whole wheat and a great value at $6.95. Three of us ordered the veal parm which we all agreed was tender, tasty, and large enough to satisfy. The sauce was thick, tangy and garlicky, much like Carmines or many of the midtown (Manhattan) Italian eateries. Also ordered at our table was lasagna and a clam and mussel dish. All were very happy with their meal. The tab for it all was very reasonable. This is not a franchise restaurant. It is the real deal. RigaTony could make it in NY. The fact that it is in Tempe is, i think, fantastic.",
