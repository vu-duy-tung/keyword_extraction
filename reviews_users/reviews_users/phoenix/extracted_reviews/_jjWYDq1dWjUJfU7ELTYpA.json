Need to try some other stuff next time but will probably get the brisket again.  Mac and Cheese was ok.  Beans are gravy based.  Potato salad was pretty average.  Slaws are good.  They have both a creamy and a vinegar based slaw. Wish they were closer but will stop in when I'm in the area.  I'd post a pic but we ate it all.",

    "text": "We stumbled on the place while looking for lunch today. It was a great find! The food is really delicious! I had the 1 meat choice and 2 sides--pulled chicken, baked beans and cole slaw and my guy had the 2 meat platter--brisket and sausage with Mac n cheese and corn. I was pleased that the sides are not heavily salted. However, I think they should offer a larger portion of pickled onions and pickles (bar?) and increase the side choices by offering some southern greens--collards or okra or (lightly creamed) spinach or kale. The brisket was too fatty or my liking. Cornbread is tiny but good.",

The first thing I noticed was the clean, relaxed and inviting atmosphere. It's a fast casual / Chipotle style line where your food gets plated in front of the customer. I mentioned it was my first time and the gentleman behind the counter recommended the current special: pulled pork sandwich and a side for $5. I thought that sounded like a great deal and ended up getting some ribs as well. All of this great food was under $10, which I greatly appreciate. I will come back, but I will make sure to get the sweet, creamy slaw to put on my pulled pork sandwich. One of the employees gave me a sample and it is a winning combination with the pork.",

We've had some fantastic BBQ in Kentucky and while we weren't expecting that level, we were cautiously hopeful. Everyone is very friendly and the service was good. I ordered the 2 meats platter with pulled pork and brisket with two sides. I chose coleslaw and cornbread muffins. My wife picked the pulled pork sandwich and corn muffins as her side. We were charged $2 for the coleslaw which we understood to be included. All of the food was barley warm and that's being generous. The two choices of sauce were spicy or sweet and both were honestly average. The muffins were dry. The pulled pork was cold but decent. The brisket was dry. Disappointing for sure.",

Ribs were really good with the sweet bbq sauce but I also really loved the spicy bbq sauce. Mac and cheese was bland but good if you added bbq sauce. Potato salad was bland it needs something for texture and flavor. I would suggest tackling both with diced pickle. Beans were good they had pieces of meats in it. All in all it was good! Again, coming from someone who doesn't do bbq often.",

With that said, however, I can say my brisket was melt-in-your-mouth good and their sweet BBQ sauce is probably one of the best I've had. Their sides were good as well, but I stuck with beans and corn, so there's only so much one can say about them.  To be honest, I didn't spend much time in the restaurant. I ordered to-go and they got my food prepared quick enough to the point where I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. The workers we're really friendly, though, and the place looked pretty clean.   Overall, the food and service were great and the price reasonable for a quality BBQ experience. If you're in the area, try it out!",

With the sliced meat you can request lean or fattier, both taste great.    I like the coleslaw or green beans and potato salad or mac and cheese for sides.    The sauces are OK, the hotter sauce is my choice.  The mustard sauce is good for a change of pace. The cornbread is OK, but wish it came with some butter.  The pickled onions are good, they just need to serve more of them.  I'm really happy they opened here, we needed a good barbecue place.  I'm a supporter.",

I had salad with brisket on top. The romaine was crunchy, crisp and really dark green.  I got a mix with kale and I appreciate them lightly steaming/blanching the kale so it's flavorful than when it's raw (dry). I choose jicama, red peppers, rainbow cherry tomatoes, and cukes. $9. I wanted to try their ribs so I got 2 pieces for $4. Fabulous. Others wrote it fatty but I'm ok with it. It falls off the bones. Hubby got salad brisket as well with a side of their mac and cheese. Small side is $2. People might complain about their mac but I see it more on the healthy side: not too cheesy dense-it lightly covered the bases. The ice tea is freshly brewed with 3 varieties: unsweetened, sweetened and watermelon. I appreciate this because I hate the processed Nestea crap and other commercial flavored teas out there. There was thought put to everything.",

Potato salad - this mix of uncooked potatoes, globs of mayo and not much else caused vomiting and nausea for one person dining last night.  Mac and Cheese - possibly the worst version of this dish west of the Mississippi. One customer put it best \"had better out of the box\" Watery, not cheesy, strange noodles. Carolina Cole Slaw - large pieces of poorly cut cabbage only saturated in terrible dressing Baked Beans - uncooked beans in an odd tasting sauce BBQ sauce. Inedible Cornbread - this needs a new recipe. Hard and flavorless little muffins  MEAT: The Ribs were a mess, but they looked good. They were neither baby back or st, louis and had big knuckles on them of fat making it difficult to eat. Not falling off bone and just cooked by an amateur. Chicken - nothing special, but probably the best meat. Brisket - fatty slices and not enough of them on the $15 2 meat platter.  Felt hungry and ripped off after this meal. The Valley has alot of BBQ places, but not alot of smart educated experienced BBQ people who eat the food and therefore they get better ratings than needed. Keep your clothes on and skip naked bbq.",

Their second best meat may be the pulled pork, which is tender and moist but not particularly tasty.  I tried five of the seven available sides and only one was worth reordering - the creamy slaw.  The meat is served without sauce (\"naked\") and the two sauces they have appear to be identical except for the heat, and neither is what you would describe as fabulous.  Prices are typical but since the meat portions are large, Naked BBQ provides a reasonable value.  Ambience is modern lunch counter and does nothing to remind me of BBQ.",

The 5 star review is strictly based on the Brisket and Ribs.  I have not yet tried any of the other meats, and I wasn't very fond of the sides that I tried.  More on the sides in a moment.    I ordered a two meat platter.  The ribs were perfectly cooked, very tasty, and not sauced (which is how I prefer them).  They were delicious, and even better when I warmed up my leftover ribs the next day.  The brisket, which I requested fatty and sliced with some bark on it, was the best I've had here in Arizona.  It was moist, flavorful, had nice texture and was delicious although the bark was a bit on the salty side from the course salt that they seasoned it with before cooking.  I hadn't had brisket that good since back when I lived in Texas.  The meat was definitely 5 stars, and I can't wait to go back to try the other meats.  I know that folks taste in BBQ sauce is a matter of personal preference.  To be honest, I couldn't really tell the difference between Naked's sweet sauce and the spicy sauce, and I didn't care for either of them - but I am one of those people who has pretty specific sauce preferences.  Both sauces were too sweet for me, so I just left them off.  The meat was good enough to stand on its own any day.  The ribs were only warm, and the brisket was about room temperature but that didn't make a difference to me.  Now, the sides... The cornbread muffin was just ok.  The mac & cheese was better than a lot of places, but it was not warm enough.  I was glad that green beans (seasonal vegetable varies) were available as a healthy option, but I didn't care for whatever seasoning they used on them and they too were not warm.  Since I didn't go for the sides, I'm sticking to 5 stars for Naked BBQ and will plan on just enjoying the meat there next time.  I did love the watermelon iced tea!    Their prices seemed a bit on the hgh side, but given the quality of the BBQ, I will gladly spend my money to eat here in the future!  I should mention that service was fast, helpful and friendly.  As I ate the owner and another individual (manager?) stopped by my table to say hello and make sure my food was ok.  A couple of notes:  They do sell out of items on busy days, and sliced brisket is not available in sandwiches, only chopped.",

Overall, it would be worth coming back for that pulled pork and sauce. I didn't even really add any of the BBQ sauce (which was too sweet for my taste) and instead just drowned it in the vinegar and mustard sauce.",

We were greeted by the staff and walked through the menu choices and even offered a sample.  I decided on the one meat platter with two sides.  My meat was the hot link ( the not so spicy one ) Mac and cheese and cole slaw for my sides. A really cool add on are their homemade pickles you can have or not at no extra charge. They have two choices of BBQ sauce that we thought would be hot ( temperature) since it was in a heated container but it was luke warm. The food is on a tray which is not my favorite but it's a BBQ place so that's the trend lately. The food was really good. The hot link was as described.  The mac and cheese was really good. Not everyone can get it right but I must say this was a favorite. The cole slaw was good too and again not everyone can make a good cole slaw. My overall impression was bravo for good food and great customer service. All pluses from this yelper. See you again soon.",

The owners did a fantastic job of accommodating the specific needs of our group, which was to have a small sampling plate - just enough to taste a variety of things.

The meat was good, not too smoky, and the sides had great flavor.  A couple of things I want to say though...the chicken, although good was basically sitting in grease so when we had leftovers it was completely gelatinous, but regardless good. The mac and cheese had a great flavor, but it was more like cheese soup with noodles...it's all about the roux guys!! The one thing that a lot of us did was take that cheese sauce and mix it in with the beans, and that was really good! The beans were unlike any baked beans Ive had before, very good! As stated from a fellow reviewer, the buns are perfect. You can make a nice and heavy with meat sandwich and it won't fall apart. I put the coleslaw on the pork and it was perfect! We will definitely be going back for more!",

I always ask for the fatty pieces.   The sides are great. I recommend the Carolina coleslaw - it's tangy.   The bbq sauces are good. My girlfriend likes the spicy version. I wish they had a vinegar one!  The pickles and onions are delicious, don't skip those.",

It was dinner time and the place was empty at first, but filled up quickly and had a positive buzz and a number of other happy people like ourselves. Next time we will bring the kid.  I had the two-meat platter with sliced brisket and shredded pork.  My sides were the potato salad and green beans.  I had the sweet and smoky BBQ sauce and my wife had their shredded pork sandwich with a spicy BBQ sauce.  Both were great, tasty, solid BBQ.  You could see the smoke rings in the meat and it had just enough char to enhance the flavor without overpowering it.   We enjoyed out meal, the sides were good.  The potato salad was standard, decent, nothing to write home about but was good with the meal.  The special veggie was garlic green beans and were also good - could have been cooked a little more.  We had the huge chocolate chip cookie for dessert, which was just crispy enough on the edges and chewy in the center.   Also, to the reviewer who lamented that this place was the \"The gentrification of BBQ continues in N. Scottsdale with Naked BBQ\", check yourself.  How pretentious, and at the same time stupid, can a person be?  Are you sure you know what the word \"gentrification\" means?  Scottsdale is, in the scope of all things, a new town.  Up until a few years ago you had to go to downtown Phoenix for anything resembling BBQ outside of the McRib.    Naked BBQ is my new favorite place.  I wanted to like The Thumb, but they keep tripping up on customer service.  Their food is comparable, but the price is higher, and the counter help couldn't be less friendly.  The staff at Naked BBQ welcomed us, talked us through our selections.  I look forward to going again, soon.",

I didn't need a toothpick afterward, which is always a sign of good barbecue. The beans were a little on the tough side for me and needed some more flavor so I added some barbecue sauce. They weren't bad but weren't the best. The pineapple beer was on point. I ended up finishing my husband's banana pudding. It was delish. It was your basic banana pudding with vanilla wafers and whipped cream, just the way I like it. My husband enjoyed his meal as well.",

They offered suggestions and a cool history of the place, as well as a reminder of their other location.  We ordered some of everything - brisket, pulled pork, coleslaw, beans, cornbread muffins, Mac and cheese, and potato salad.  The brisket was exceptionally dry with no moisture whatsoever. The pulled pork was equally dry. The coleslaw leaked a thin, watery liquid onto the metal tray. The beans tasted very old. The cornbread muffins had clearly been out for hours, hard and crumbly. The Mac and cheese had zero cheese; just simply dry cooked pasta. The potato salad was equally dated, having no flavor at all.  We even tried their \"peach cobbler,\" which was stale, over baked, and clearly used canned peaches and way too much cinnamon.  After spending $45 dollars for the dinner, we waved goodbye and resolved to take our business elsewhere.  Nice staff, but there were no other patrons in the restaurant on a Friday night. I think they reserve their best food for maybe Saturdays?",

I would put Naked BBQ in my top 3.  I obviously have a loyalty to Little Miss BBQ, but this place is pretty damn solid.  So I've been to the original  Naked BBQ off Bell, so i was extremely pleasantly surprised to find one here.  So my lady and I were at Banner Health for the delivery of our baby.  Since I was there for three days, i wanted to get some Portillos and see what else was in the area.  So as I soon discovered N. BBQ, I had to give this location a try.  I ordered the two meat plate, chopped brisket and smoked links with beans and mac and cheese.  The brisket was smoky and had a great flavor and the links were on point.  Crisp, meaty, and had a nice little kick at the end.  The sides were great, beans were delicious and the mac and cheese was awesome. I remember bringing it back to the hospital room, every person in the room asked what was that smell of that food from.  Overall, solid BBQ. I would highly recommend this place.  Thomas",

One of the best steaks I have ever eaten. A generous cut of beef, cooked perfectly, smoke, salt, super simple. Sides were great. No sauce needed. The sauces are great though. But the meats stand on their own. Why would you wanna f with a good thing? My rookie mistake was driving back to the east valley during rush hour and letting it steam itself to medium doneness. An amazing meal even so. Not going to repeat that mistake. We're gonna eat the thing right then and there: that's how you respect the animal that gave you this meal and the people who prepared it for you. Devotion, meats, devotion.",

I cut three lanes over with my trailer and tow got off at Shea and got into the parking lot. Is in storage the back of the store I could just see, yes, they were open. My heart filled with such Glee and happiness I could barely contain myself. I walked in and 3 other folks walking out we're asking me why aren't you eating your own hot dogs? I replied I do have the best hot dogs in the state but this barbecue is so off the hook good I seek it out whenever I can. So folks, thank you so much for another fantastic dinner that made me oh so happy. I will come here whenever I am nearby and you are open.",

I ordered the sliced brisket with side of Mac N Cheese and Carolina Slaw.  The good news is the brisket was amazing - well smoked and full of flavor, so good in fact it hardly needed the side of spicy BBQ sauce.  The Mac N Cheese was also delish! Velvety smooth sauce with lots of cheese flavor.  The cornbread muffin was forgettable, a tiny nugget of bland corn meal...  however this pales in comparison to the Carolina Slaw.  I do understand that Carolina Slaw is vinegar based but this styrofoam cup of Slaw was literally drowning in vinegar.  Inedible after a single forkful.  It was like swallowing a spoonful of straight apple cider vinegar - not pleasant at all.  Hopefully that recipe is corrected.  Otherwise would have been a 4 star review.",

    "text": "Ambiance: Smallish restaurant in a shopping complex, with a order your food at the counter set-up. Has about 14 tables. Decorated in some wood paneling with blues music playing adds to the BBQ motif. Patrons from all ages and backgrounds.  Food: Menu includes several sandwich and platter options (pulled pork, pulled chicken, brisket etc). I went with the pulled chicken sandwich and was pleasantly surprised. Very tender and full of genuine flavor. No need to add BBQ sauce although they have several sauces available. The sides are great as well. I went with the corn bread which was great. Also nice to see several sweet tea options.  Service/price: Pretty simple order at counter setup allows for a quick in and out experience. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. Sandwiches are eight dollars which I thought was fair for the portion sizes.  Overall: Great BBQ option if you're in the mood for a quick in and out experience and don't need the traditional dine in experience.",

    "text": "This place just needs a little push and it'll be just right.   First visit was about two weeks ago.  They were out of ribs by 7PM. I ordered the brisket. Too salty. Very tender and moist though.  The server noted my disappointment over the rib outage so I asked for the end cut and was assured of getting it.  Didn't get it.   Bummer. Beans and potato salad were okay.   Second visit was two evenings ago. Got my ribs and they looked beautiful. Alas, I couldn't taste any smoky flavor. And the banana pudding is, well, a joke. Not one slice of banana was present in the creamy pudding. And the 'Nilla Wafers are crumbled on top. And to add insult to culinary injury you'll be asked if you want the cookies included. That stunned me when I was asked the question. Of course I want them...it didn't occur to me that the cookies wouldn't be \"in\" the pudding. Sheesh!  Lastly, the choice of sauces is limited and not what you'll be expecting. There are two of them. Both are heavily vinegar-based. Yuck. Where's the traditional, spicy tomato based BBQ sauces like they have at Dave's??!!??  I'll be back, but it'll be for brisket and/or pulled pork sandwiches. Like a one-car parade they'll be hard to screw-up.",

From the moment we walked in, the young gentleman was very welcoming. I let him know we were from out of town and that we have never been there. He recommended the pulled pork which was delicious as he said it would be. We also had chopped brisket, Mac and Cheese, potato salad and the vegetable of the day which was green beans sauted with garlic and butter. All was amazing. I also loved the pickled cucumber and onions and cornbread that completed the meal. For dessert we settled for the banana pudding which they offered to add whipped cream and vanilla wafers! The young gentleman had also recommended the cookies... which by the way are humongous. We got those to go!  Service here by far is the best I've had while being in Arizona! What I really enjoyed was how hospitable they were with everyone that came in.  Food was amazing and the service was impeccable!",

The chicken is drippy and flavorless. The turkey is dry. The sauce comes separate, hence \"naked.\" I like adding it myself, but can understand that may bother some.

Meals are served on paper covered, 12 x 8-inch or so aluminum trays. The sides are very large and meat servings are ample. I really liked the spicy bbq sauce, but the sweet is good too. Our order came very fast.   This a walk-up-and-order restaurant with friendly service and charming minimalist, wood-themed decor. You can come as you are dressed, including T-shirts and shorts.   Cole slaw is an included side option and there are two kinds: creamy and spicy vinegar based. I got half and half, which is a great blend. Or you can get baked beans or potato salad. I did not find any of the food I had oversalted.    The housemade pickles remind me of those my grandpa used to make by soaking cucumber slices in cider vinegar and onions, so I love them.The cornbread is not a highlight, but it is included and a nice touch. The smoked meat was very good.   This will be one of our regular stops.",

    "text": "Welcome to 85258 Naked BBQ!  This new restaurant serves up the finest BBQ in Scottsdale.  Same great food as the other location on Bell and I-17 but this one has plenty of extra room to dine in, open for dinner and...best of all...beer and wine!   I have been a regular at the other location for quite some time now.  ANY time I'm in the area I get take out meat by the lb. (***tip*** meat is the same price per lb. no matter if 1/4, 1/2 etc. so you can buy a little if you want!)  Their chopped brisket sandwich is my favorite and it's available sliced as well.  Sometimes burnt ends are available too (a True culinary delicacy)  ....those are amazing here!   Although the whole naked concept is True i.e. this Q needs no sauce, the BBQ sauce here just so happens to be the best I have ever had!  The irony is delicious!   All the BBQ sauces are great but the spicy one is my favorite. It has just the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  They're kept in electric warmed pumps in the corner near the drink fountains for dine in guests.  Pre-made containers of their liquid ambrosia are available to go at the register.  Woo Hoo! Naked BBQ!  For opening day today I got half a rack of ribs.  Came in starving and it kept me full all day!    Can't wait to return for prime rib Friday night and beef rib Saturday night!    Those pics to come ...watch this space!",

The meat was Smokey but no thick smoke line on the brisket. Ribs were tender but too many baby bones. They have 4 varieties of bbq sauce I ended up liking the spicy sauce. I gave them a 3 based on portion size, flavor and customer service. I guess I'm just used to slow cooked bbq on a real pit not indoor smoker and a thick smoke line with some crust.  My sides were their garlic green beans. Eh okay  Mac-n-cheese were okay but I make better.",

    "text": "Today for lunch, my colleague and I decided to go to Naked Q. My colleague said they had excellent brisket so I decided to give it a try. We got there around 1:30pm. There were a few occupied tables. You order at the register and by the time you pay, your food is ready. We both ordered the 2 meat platter. I chose the pulled chicken and the sliced brisket as my two meats. I also decided to try the Mac & cheese (even though I don't eat cheese) & the coleslaw as the two sides. The meal also comes with a muffin (corn bread) and you can have free pickles. Can't remember but I believe I paid either $15 or $16 for this meal. My colleague ordered the pulled pork and sliced brisket and ordered the Mac & cheese and beans as her sides. There are quite a few sauces to choose from. I chose the hot BBQ for the brisket and the mustard sauce for the chicken. The price is pretty high however, the meal is big & even though it didn't look like much at the beginning, I was stuffed by the end of it.   The brisket was pretty good. It was very tender and juicy and the sauce was not too spicy, it gave the meat a great flavor. The chicken, honestly, I didn't like it. I ate a bite of it before adding the mustard sauce and it wasn't very good. I added the sauce and it was better but still meh. I actually had maybe a couple of bites or so and then decided to just not eat it. The coleslaw was ok, Mac & cheese was good. The corn bread was dry but the flavor was there. My colleague didn't care for the beans but everything else she had was pretty good.   I may be back here again but just for the brisket.",

We generally don't patronize restaurants that require us to go through a line to order and receive food then serve our own drinks and get our utensils. Increasing the minimum wage increases self serve restaurants.  If we had been by ourselves we would have moved on but we were with another couple who wanted to try it.  The people \"on the line\" were friendly and helpful.  When paying, I was offered a tip option. No table service was offered but how do you walk away from a minimum tip. I probably would have if I had realized it would take ten minutes to get my beer served and when I received it that it would have a head taking up 1/4 of the $6 plastic cup.   The food varied in quality. The beef brisket was great and it is now available sliced. I enjoyed it.  My wife did not enjoy the dry chicken. I liked the sauce choices. The potato salad was ok according to my wife. The cole slaw was bland..,certainly unexceptional. The beans were uninteresting: spice or sweet sauce or something would have been nice. The muffins were definitely a waste of space.  Our friends had sandwiches which had minimal meat on maximum buns.  I am not an expert when it comes to barbecue but I know enough to wonder about the many 5 star reviews.  There can't be that many people in Scottsdale who have never had good barbecue.",

Fans of Toms Thumb BBQ, which is okay, need to try this for REAL BBQ!!!  The prices on all of the items are reasonable, but especially the deserts.  Two dollars for peach cobbler and banana pudding can you say hell yeah!   I had a two meat platter with smoked turkey and pulled pork.  If you haven't tried the smoked turkey yet with sweet sauce, you haven't truly lived.  My wife and I were fortunate enough to go early on Friday, which is $20 prime rib.  I am not a steak eater by any means, but the perfectly pink 20 oz prime rib nearly converted me.  I honestly thought the slab of prime rib was a double slice on accident.  The only reason that I didn't give it five stars was because they forgot my desert, but it was really busy and I called and they will make it right on my next order.",

Consequently, I seldom miss an opportunity to savor this special fare so when we noticed the new joint we had to stop in.  The place is clean and the staff is friendly.  The time was 7:50 pm and we were shocked to learn they were closing in 10 minutes.  What. BBQ restaurant that sells beer closes at 8.  We ordered the two meat plate just to sample and see if we wanted to return.  The brisket is average as is the mac and cheese.  Cornbread again average and no butter offered or served with it.  The turkey however was exceptional and they deserve some kind praise for a great smoking job.  Moist and delicious.  As we finished our meal we watched them turn customers away starting at 815 pm and that's a horrible business decision for any new business.  The owner needs to wake up and stay up for at least another hour.  Crazy.  Anyway we will give it another try and see what they have accomplished with their pork.",

Simple menu, yet had all of the classic BBQ staples you would expect. I did the two neat plate, ribs and brisket plus beans and Carolina cold slaw with some cornbread to top it off. All five items were delicious, and you can tell great care went into choosing the ingredients and cooking the food. Highly recommend, my only complaint is that they don't have one in the east valley where I live :)",

Ordered a brisket sandwich and mac & cheese.  Large measured portion of chopped brisket.  Would prefer a more distinct smoke flavor but still quite tasty.  Two BBQ sauces served on the side.  The mild sweet sauce was a nice compliment to the brisket.  Mac & Cheese serving was ample but just average taste. Come early as this is a popular spot for lunch as it filled up quickly.",

Meat was fresh, moist and slightly firm bbq style, good portion size, and served dry with BBQ sauce self-serve on the side. I pretty much only eat turkey meat and this one was grade A! Sides were fresh and not overly creamy or salty. One doesn't often think this about a BBQ joint, but I left feeling great! Meal didn't feel \"heavy\" but I was definitely full. I would most definitely come to this place again. The restaurant was very clean also.",

    "text": "I stopped here for the 1st time over the weekend. I will definitely be back again (and again). I was very impressed with this place.   I will start with the food. I got a 2 meat platter with sliced brisket and ribs with baked beans and mac 'n' cheese for sides. The brisket was excellent! It was tender and perfectly done with a nice smoke ring and a great crispy bark on the outside. The ribs were well smoked and tender. At first glance the ribs looked a little smaller than I like but they gave me 4 (my wife got 3 bigger ones) and I ended up taking 2 home. The baked beans were very good and the recipe they use lets you actually taste the beans, not just the sauce. A great balance of flavors. The mac n cheese was not the best I've ever had but better than a lot of other places. The only thing I was not impressed with was the cornbread muffin. It was very small and kind of bland. I would give 5 stars with better cornbread.   Now on to the restaurant itself. The place was very clean and the staff is A+. I didn't feel rushed while looking at the menu board and deciding what to get and the staff chatted with us while we made our decisions. While we were eating someone (I assume he was the manager) stopped by our table (and several others) to make sure everything was good and see if we needed anything.    All in all this is good simple BBQ done right.",

My favorite sauce was mustered one. Their hot sauce was pretty good too. I enjoyed a few different sauce.  Portion size was huge! I had two types of meat. Corn bread was tasty, I wish it was larger. Side dishes was very good too. Creamy slaw was my favorite so far.  Very clean inside. I mean really clean. Tables, floor, bathroom...

And I got the \"hot\" BBQ sauce.   It doesn't really need the sauce.   The meat is succulent and tasty without it.   The hot links were delish, a bit on the \"hot\" side but not much.   The pork is perfect.   The ribs are a bit too fatty.   They are quite good, but with that much fat on it, I dunno.  I think I'd like to check out the slab before buying it next time.  I'd give it five stars but for the fattiness of the ribs.   If it wasn't for that. ...  I'll be returning.   There is a location more on the west side.   Either way, it's definitely worth the trip.

The Hot Links are spicy and have a nice kick to them. The sides that we ordered, Brisket Baked Beans, Cole Slaw and Potato Salad were all good and were made from scratch.   The owner, Oren H. buses tables and comes by to see how you enjoyed your meal. He's sincere and friendly, and cares a lot about your experience. Nice!  When he first opened Naked BBQ, the first hundred or so reviews were all Five Stars and he's pretty close to that average now. If you stop by, you'll understand why.   Expect to pay around $15 to $17 for a fantastic BBQ meal with all the fix'ens. You can order a one meat platter for $11, or a two meat platter for $15 which comes with two sides. They have sandwiches in the $8+ range, with Pop or Iced Tea available (see Menu photo).   Btw, you can also order all their meats by the Pound, for only $14 to $17 and yes, they cater. Wow   Enjoy!",

    "text": "Great barbecue is hard to come by, and we're lucky in Phoenix/Scottsdale to have some pretty darned good choices.  Naked BBQ is absolutely one of the best, and I say that both as a lover of great barbecue, and as a long-time KCBS certified barbecue judge.  In fact, the brisket here may well be the best in the state of Arizona.    I've been to both locations for Naked BBQ, and grillmaster/owner Oren is clearly able to maintain his top quality at both places.  Add to that his outgoing friendliness and eagerness to make sure that you're completely happy with your meal, and you've got a barbecue dining experience second to none.  The \"naked\" in the name refers to the fact that all of these meats can be enjoyed without any sauce, or you can add either of the two available homemade barbecue sauces.  I happen to enjoy the brisket naked, but also occasionally adding a bit of the sweeter sauce.  Even with Oren's outstanding brisket, I couldn't give the full 5 stars unless everything else matched that quality, and it absolutely does.  The ribs are tender and flavorful, the pulled pork is juicy and melt-in-your-mouth, and all of the other main dishes measure up.  And if you're lucky enough be there on a Saturday before they run out of their limited-edition beef ribs, definitely go for it.  And all of Oren's sides are top-notch and homemade.  I am a great fan of the pickle slices, a sweet and vinegary combination that I find addictive.  In fact, I often purchase a large container of the crunchy slices to take home.    I could go on as well about all of the flavorful sides - the baked beans, the mac & cheese, the potato salad - everything is fresh and delicious.  Add to it all the cleanliness of the restaurant and the plentiful free parking, and Naked BBQ is easily a 5-star barbecue experience that you need to try whenever you might be craving barbecue that is prepared perfectly.",

The pulled chicken and all the sides I've tried have been very good as well. The location in Scottsdale has a small eat-in area, but this place is also great for takeout. A couple of times I've called ahead to have them do impromptu catering for home entertaining. Give them a little notice and they'll hook you up with a ready to go buffet for 8-25+ people.  Really great product, and always friendly service.",

But I didn't have to because this place has great sweet tea! Went with my guy once and then dragged my parents out from Tempe to try it within a week. The employees are friendly and almost as attentive as a sit down restaurant. The food is hot, and they weigh it so you are consistently getting the same amount. THE PICKLES are out of this world, eat them! If you don't like pickles you should still try them cuz they rock! I'm pretty certain that, in just two visits, I have become low key obsessed with this place.   The ONLY bad thing I have to say is that my peach cobbler was runny, but that may be due to the temperature at which I was serve - a little too hot. Still tasted good but it should be more firm.",

    "text": "After swearing to myself I wouldn't waste my time at Dickey's anymore, I've been on the hunt for a new BBQ place close to work. I've found it!  Upon walking in, we were greeted by a nice guy behind the counter. You can get sandwiches which come with one side, one or two meat platters which come with two sides and cornbread, or a salad. They also have meat by the pound. I got a pulled pork platter with creamy slaw and Mac n cheese but they also have brisket, chicken, turkey, etc. They also have pickles upon request.   They serve you all meat naked (get it??) but have four sauces you can select from near the drink station. Sweet, spicy, vinegar and mustard sauce. I grabbed some sweet and mustard sauce and off I went.   The pulled pork was awesome! And it's always nice to self apply all of your sauce to your liking. The Mac n cheese wasn't any basic kraft kind either, it tasted homemade and delicious. The creamy slaw was excellent as well. I've never been a huge fan of cornbread, but the corn flavor was more apparent than other kinds I've tried, so I assume that's a plus.  For 11 dollars I left very full and very happy.   The employees were friendly and checked on people as they ate to make sure they enjoyed their food. We ate inside and left only mildly smelling like BBQ, another plus. I'll definitely be back and recommend this place!",

    "text": "Naked BBQ over on I-17 and Bell Road has been dishing out some pretty decent meat for awhile now. So, I was not surprised when I heard that a second location in Scottsdale would be opening up. Although the Yelp lists the restaurant as \"Naked BBQ,\" it's actually called NakedQ.  If you're familiar with the original location on Bell, you'll find an identical menu and similar setup - sans the writing on the walls.   I ordered a meat platter of both chopped and sliced brisket, while my girlfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich. I opted for a side of mac and cheese and decided to forgo my second side option for extra cornbread muffins.   Now, as I've stated in my review of their other location, Naked, on a good day, can deliver BBQ that's right up there with some of the best that we've found in our search. Although unfortunately, not every day is a \"good\" day. The quality of the meats were decent, as they usually are, but everything was a bit too cold for some reason. The brisket was good, although not quite as smoky as I remember. The pulled pork was fine, but also not quite as warm as what's considered to be the norm. I'm not sure what all this was about, but it's always a risk when you decide to branch out.  As I rant about in almost every BBQ review I write, it's usually not the meat that's the problem, it's the quality of the sides. Naked's mac and cheese is just okay, while their cornbread muffins are the kind that incorporate actual corn itself and traces of jalapeno. It gives it more of that \"souffle\" type of taste, that isn't really my thing.  Overall, despite my minor complaints, I still think this is one of the better BBQ joints that we've found in our search. It's nice to see that their success has enabled them to open a second location, although I think in the future, I'll stick to the original.  Recommended!",

    "text": "We came for lunch on Sunday and were very pleased to see they had salad options in addition to the standard sandwiches, platters and meat by the pound.   Even though some of the meats by the pound are much more expensive than others you can choose any of the proteins on top of the salad for the same $9 price for the whole salad. Given that opportunity I chose the chopped brisket ($20/lb straight). Had read other reviews that the brisket was sliced to order and made the assumption the same was True for the salad...unfortunately it was not. Some of the pieces of brisket on the salad were a little dry and others were very moist. They all had good flavor but if they could slice one 4 oz piece of brisket fresh to order, chop it and put it right on the salad, this thing would be absolutely amazing.   The other great part of the experience was that this was like Chipotle in that you walk through and they ask you what you like on your salad from the little buckets of pre-cut vegetables, egg whites etc. They had roasted corn which I got and I'm not sure if they intended to be quite as chewy and dry as it was or if it had just gotten a little bit old. It certainly added interesting texture but seemed a little too dry and not quite as fresh as it might have been.   One of the servers suggested I try the thin, white horseradish sauce for the salad. They put that in a separate cup as I had already ordered balsamic vinaigrette on the side. Being a barbecue place and because I had hot chopped beef brisket on my salad, I also served myself some of the warm spicy barbecue sauce that is available to everyone. I use a little bit of both and got a piece where the horseradish sauce had mixed with the spicy barbecue sauce. That was freaking amazing. That led me to mix the two sauces together. So if you ever go there and you like horseradish and you like barbecue sauce, try a 50/50 combo of the horseradish sauce with sweet or spicy barbecue sauce as a dressing for your salad. It would probably go well on top of a chopped brisket or pork sandwich or even just as a sauce for any of the meats as well.  We also tried a pulled pork sandwich, the baked beans and two bones of the St. Louis spareribs.  The pulled pork was very moist and flavorful and the bun it was served on was also fresh.   The St. Louis spareribs were well seasoned and very moist, but I wish they had baby back ribs because it always drives me crazy having to spit out all those little nuggets of cartilage that are on the one end of a St. Louis rib. Also since this is a fast casual place I think two dollars per St. Louis rib is a little bit too pricey. That would be $24 a rack and you pay that in a sit down restaurant. Doesn't seem appropriately priced here. $1.50 or $1.75 a rib max would be more fair.  The baked beans were not too sweet and had some chunks of meat in them.  All of the staff was extremely helpful and courteous. Perhaps they were just overstaffed but it was nice to have people come out and clear your table even though the concept is fast casual and you're supposed to bus your own place.  Barbecue places generally leave us less than satisfied however Naked BBQ is very, very good and we would definitely return. The five stars here reflects the quality and flavor of the food at this location versus other barbecue spots that always seem to have four stars yet are very disappointing. Being better than all of those I had to give this one five stars.",

My dates chicken breast was a little dry and the Mac and cheese looked kind of like watered down cheese.  The cash register prompting me for a tip when I was paying felt awkward and I gave a 15% tip even though it was just a checkout register.   The cost is a little on the higher side, $15 for two meats and two smaller sides compared to Famous Daves, but we both enjoyed our food and will likely be back.",

Before  going I watched a video showing how they prepare the meat for smoking...it showed lots and lots of rub.  However, on my visit last night there was no rub whatsoever on the ribs.  Further, they did not remove the membrane from the ribs - rookie move.  The ribs were basically flavorless.  The turkey was a bit better...lots of smokiness but a bit on the dry side.  The sides were both totally tasteless.  It's a good thing they don't put BBQ sauce on the meat because it's more like BBQ syrup...overly sweet and runny. I had high hopes since this location is so convenient.  No reason to go back.",

Fairly straight forward without a whole lot of extra as it should be.   I got the 2 meat platter with sliced brisket and pulled pork. The pulled pork was actually some of the best I have had since moving to Arizona. Great moisture to it, good flavor and it was a decent portion. The brisket was just okay. I would like to say that pre-slicing brisket before it is ordered should be considered a sin. Also, the brisket portion was very small. I think it was 3 slices. MAYBE 4 but they were pretty thin. The bark on the outside wasn't anything to write home about but was still alright.   The sides I got were mac and cheese and cole slaw. Sides are sides. Kind of hard to mess those up.   As far as the BBQ sauces they had a sweet one and a spicy one. Both were incredibly sweet. The spicy one tasted identical to the sweet one except that maybe they threw some red chili flakes in there.   Overall it was okay. I would maybe come back for a pulled pork sandwich if I was in the area but I can't see myself going out of the way to come back.",

Turkey breast and ribs were good as well but definitely overshadowed by the others mentioned.  Prices are reasonable for BBQ and will definitely be back.  Another plus - these guys don't use sauce at all, I would imagine it's just smoke and rub. There is sauce available on the dining area but I didn't partake. I avoid sauces in general so thought someone may appreciate knowing that.  Great experience overall and will definitely be back! Wish they had one in the east valley!!",

In addtion, to thier delicious meat selection Naked BBQ has a variety of side dishes and desserts. Everything from coleslaw, potato salad, macaroni & cheese, baked beans,  roasted vegetables, cornbread,  peach cobbler, and bacon Maple donuts.     What I enjoyed most about Naked BBQ is they serve thier entree's  NAKED (without sauce).  So you can dress your entree just the way you like it.  I went for the sweet sauce and it was absolutely delicious.   The staff at Naked BBQ is second to none.  Service is fast and friendly.  Food I'd delicious and reasonably priced.  It doesn't get any better.  If you enjoy good BBQ, stop by you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I gotta give BBQ props to these guys for offering the best bits of smoked beef I've had in the Southwest. Get some fatty brisket and let that goodness melt in your mouth in a cacophony of salty smoky smoothness that only members of the low and slow school know how to deliver.  at my last visit, my son went for the baby backs, and nearly polished them off. Not bad for a nine year old, but again it's a testament to the meat. The owner or manager walked the restaurant while we ate, and was super nice and even offered to bring more BBQ for my son if he ran out of food. We didn't need to take him up on the offer, but I thought that was cool.  For the sides, the Mac & Cheese is a solid choice. Not the best I've had but definitely good. The Carolina slaw is pretty awesome in it's own right. It's almost like eating kimchee, but it cuts thru the fat and flavors  nicely and helps you keep enjoying the BBQ throughout the meal. They also give you a sweet corn muffin with the plates.  Their BBQ sauce is just okay, nothing special. But it does compliment the meat pretty well. I just love interesting BBQ sauce that uses spices in cool ways, but their stuff is pretty basic   All in all, this is my go to place to hit in Scottsdale when I want to get my BBQ fix, and I think that says it all.",

    "text": "Below average food - nice staff.  These \"5 star\" reviews for Naked BBQ must be paid.  The 90th Street location serves cold buns fresh out of of the bag completely plain and unprepared. There is no heating or toasting of the bun.  The meat is kept lukewarm at best. So you are getting a cold bun out of a bag with lukewarm meat that is just average.   Big deal.  They don't even offer \"sliced brisket\" ... just the chopped brisket (which includes all the fat and gristle that would normally be thrown away)    The baked beans are neither sweet nor spicy. They are not even cowboy style beans.  Plain and bland would be the best description. Canned beans are definitely better.  The cole slaw is sub par to what you get across the parking lot at Frys deli.    The BBQ sauce is terrible. Gross would be an understatement  Any store purchased BBQ sauce, such as Guy Fieri Carolina BBQ, will be ten times better.    My gut feeling is that someone visited Dickeys BBQ on 32nd and Indian School and tried to copy it.  Anyone who thinks this is 5 star BBQ hasn't visited Dickeys on 32nd street.   On a positive note, that the staff was very nice.  5 stars for the staff.    Some advice to the owners: 1) Toast your buns 2) Provide better BBQ sauce options 3) Redo all of your sides  The Sweet tea was OK but not on par with most other sweet tea.  In this shopping center you'd be better stopping at Whataburger. Better food, better tea, less money.",

As someone from Kansas City I have been yearning for some decent BBQ in this area. FINALLY.....I have somewhere to go to get a taste of the homeland. The meat was juicy and delicious...and since it isn't drowned in sauce you can enjoy the meat then add the sauce later. And the beans...that is what I judge BBQ places on...and these are amazing.

I came very close to opening a pit in Scottsdale in 1998.  I am partial to beef and most enjoy Texas rubs and oak smoke.    I looked through the reviews and have a few comments to add.  I thought the brisket  had a enjoyable flavor.  I asked for some bark and was rewarded.  Thank you.  I agree with other reviews that the cold, thick bun is a detractor.  That's an easy fix for a new store.  I found the potato salad bland.  I am partial to onion, mustard and celery as boosters.  I would like to see sliced brisket added to the menu.   I love chopped brisket for the flavor (the fat) but a good prime flat will provide the reputation and a return crowd in the Scottsdale health conscious . For sauces the sweet would be better on the pulled pork and the tangy was not very appealing  I often make the brisket I sample stand on its own adding very minimal, additional flavors.  I say be flexible and try some different things.  Mix it up for a week and see what your fans share back.  Good Luck.",

When it came to the food, this was one of the worst bbq experiences of my life, and I've ate A LOT of bbq having lived all over the Midwest and south.   The ribs were tiny, didn't fall off the bone, had almost no flavor. The hot links tasted store bought, and the brisket although not dry, had no smokiness to it. None of their meats had a good smoke ring, and the sides were inedible. I literally took a few small bites of the potato salad and beans and threw them into the garbage.   But this is what I should of expected from a bbq place that is run closer to a chipotle then a tried and True bbq joint where smoking meats is an art, and the pit master is revered.  With Naked and Dickey's the gentrification of BBQ has reached a point where you will wonder if bbq will ever be good on this side of town, I guess only time will tell.",

The pulled chicken was good, not as good as the brisket. It was a little dry but with the sauce still good. The Mac n cheese was decent. I cook so I'm use to homemade Mac n cheese but it was decent and the potato salad as well. Definitely better than most sides I have tried at bbq spots. The cornbread muffin was also good. Now let's get to the dessert. Terrible. Both the banana pudding and the peach cobbler. Possibly the worst I've ever tasted. I was surprised because the food was good. So I expected the dessert to be the same. Nope don't do it. Naked needs to contract out for dessert. And I have people who make amazing banana pudding and cobbler if they need numbers. Finally I think it's a little pricey. Not too bad but it's a bbq joint nothing fancy and a meal Can come to $30 or so. I'll be back. The brisket is worth the trip.",

My hubby ordered the brisket, that was perfectly marbled with fat and melted like butter when bit into.  I love the mac and cheese.  It's perfectly cheesy and not dry at all.  They have a sweet BBQ sauce and a spicy.  I am partial to the spicy.  It goes well on every meat.  They had Mother Road Tower Station on tap when we stopped in, so, yay for craft beer and BBQ!",

Sliced brisket platter had excellent beef with great smoke taste.  Beans had unusual spicing; perhaps rub?  Somewhere between traditional baked beans and chili.  Would get different side next time.  Mac and cheese was very good.  Corn muffin small but good.",

As you may guess by the name NakedQ, they serve their meat naked. They have sauces that have good flavor, but the brisket tasted best naked.   If you like pickles, their homemade pickles and onions are an absolute must.   My sides were beans and green beans (today's vegetable of the day).  The beans were mediocre, which is the only negative I have to say about this place. The green beans were good and worth ordering. Whenever I come back, I will probably get the veg of the day and try something different than the beans. The cornbread muffin was acceptable, but to be fair I have never found any cornbread to be amazing.   The prices are fair compared to other BBQ restaurants and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place (try the sliced brisket!).",

I had the cole slaw while she had Mac and cheese. The sandwiches were delicious and decently sized for the price. Would have preferred that the bun wouldn't have been cold (as in refrigerated). Cole slaw was good, not great. Mac and cheese was excellent. The pork itself was tender and juicy and included some of the crispy edges, which we love. They have four sauces - mustard, vinegar, sweet, and spicy). My favorite today was the vinegar sauce. I suppose I must have been channeling North Carolina. My wife loved the sweet - a real fan of Kansas City BBQ. It really was good, as was the spicy. Mustard sauce, too, but I'm not a huge mustard sauce fan. We will most definitely be back. I have to try the brisket. One Yelper complained about fatty sections of brisket, so it is really calling to me (that's where the flavor is in beef). Then at least another trip to taste the links. Eat. Enjoy. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Thank goodness I only live 6blocks away.",

Their little cornbread muffins were yummy, the mac and cheese was tasty, and the green beans were made even more delicious by ALSO dunking them in the vinegar-based BBQ. We rounded it out with two local craft beers and left happy and full.",

So far I've only tried the pulled pork and sliced brisket - brisket sliced to order as it should be. All the sauces are on the side, hence Naked BBQ, but what they offer in sauces is on point. Carolina vinegar, mustard, a really nice sweet and a perfect spicy - the last two served warm.   They also sweat the small stuff - the little details, like house-made pickles and pickled white onion, really good sides and RUB to apply at the sauce station. Well-done! Portion sizes don't skimp either, solid value.   I guess this is their second location - and it's authentic and good. Definitely try it if you're nearby.",

    "text": "just moved back to arizona after being gone too long and bbq is my favorite and couldnt wait to try this place seeing that it had 4.5 stars.  Now either i came on the wrong day or time of the day or these people that give it good ratings have never had decent bbq.  I never put much bbq sauce on anything and sometimes none but i had to flood the brisket sandwich in the sauce just to try and eat it, it was so dry and didnt taste good at all. the mac n cheese had no flavor. the beans tasted out of a can. my wifes chicken was very dry also. i struggled to finish the sandwich and this has never happened with bbq.  one of the guys at the front counter was very friendly and great, the guy at the register was lazy, we sat at the closest table to the register and he puts in on the counter for us to get instead of him taking 2-3 steps and putting it on our table. also, ive never been served bbq food this fast, not even at dickeys,, that is most likely the problem here. food sitting around.",

The brisket is tender with a good smoke flavor and smoke ring and don't bother with the sauce it doesn't need it. The hot links are delicious as well, absolutely do not miss the pickles and onions they are done in house and are delicious.",

    "text": "We brought home carry-out entrees & were all pleased and impressed with our dinners. Everything tastes like authentic \"handed down family recipes.\" I chose the pulled pork platter (pictured) that has very tender pork and their delicious sauce on the side, which comes in either sweet or spicy. They will give you plenty of extra containers or you can fill them by the soda fountain. Their sauce is so good that they even sell it. I love the sweet version, but it is not too sweet. The slaw comes in creamy or Carolina. I had the creamy, and It has the mayonnaise not \"sweet poppyseed\" dressing. The baked beans are interesting. They are made with different types of beans and there are a lot of them. They have a smokey, slightly hot spicy sauce. The tiny little corn muffins are delicious, have kernels of corn mixed in the batter, and again are not the sweet kind but have rather a \"southern home cooked\" taste. The macaroni and cheese is creamy and delicious; interestingly they add fresh cracked pepper, so you taste that as well. The hot links (pictured) come in regular and hot. The hot are hot; they get hotter as you're eating, and those little corn muffins come in pretty handy. Haha The prices are very reasonable! (See photos of menu.)",
