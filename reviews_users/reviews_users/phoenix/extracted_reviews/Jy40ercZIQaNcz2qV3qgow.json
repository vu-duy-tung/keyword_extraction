I do have to say that if you can get in before 6 PM to take advantage of their happy hour pricing, do it. The margarita's I ordered were okay, but not worth the $7.25 a piece I paid for them.   I ordered the tortilla soup and the crispy shredded beef taco (a la carte). The soup was so-so. A little salty and way too many kernels of corn for my taste. Of course one kernel of corn is too many for me.  And for the tortillas, there was none in the soup. They gave me little crispy shreds to dump in. Eh....  As for the taco. It was good, and the size was perfect for me. But one could argue that it wasn't big enough for the price you pay for it.   Finally the service was okay. The waitress was very nice and attentive. The food did come out super quick.   So yeah...that's about it.",

Being vertically challenged, I was pleased that the booth bench was high in relation to the table level, but it certainly could have had a lot more cushion.    We were brought drinks, had orders took, and tortilla chips brought promptly. I really liked the chips. They were paper thin, very crispy, and were glistening with fresh, hot, fryer oil. The pico de gallo type salsa also tasted very fresh and home-made, but it could have done better with a few less chopped onion chunks in it. Upon request, we were also brought a bowl of more picante salsa, which had the flavor of roasted red chilies. Nice.  Our orders, both from the lunch menu, were also served quite quickly.  My husband had a cheese enchilada/chicken taco combo (~$6.25) which came with black beans (on request), rice, and a cabbage garnish. I didn't even see the taco since my husband devoured it so fast, but his enchilada was swimming in a mixture of cheese & red sauce which he said was pretty tasty.   I had a chicken enchilada (~$6.75). There were nice chunks of breast in there that actually tasted like chicken, unlike some other mexican joints where the meats all have the same texture & flavor. The enchilada was drizzled with a nice green chili sauce. The spanish rice was a little bit nondescript, but was more edible than some other restaurants'.  Mine was also served with black beans as requested, and a cabbage garnish. There were also more big chunks of onion in the garnish. I'm not an onion hater, don't get me wrong, but I'm sure after this feast, nobody would want to be within four feet of me. If I was on lunch break from one of the nearby offices, I'd probably request they go easy on the onions, lest I offend my work-mates back at the office.  Although I arrived with a huge appetite, I was stuffed after devouring everything on my plate. The service was very good. Our waitress was quite attentive and quick. The food was delicious. The prices were reasonable.  I'd go again.",

We got here right at noon. There was apparently a conference going on in Phoenix the same day because there were people everywhere wearing badges from different universities from all over the world. This place was PACKED. I could tell that the staff was not expecting this rush because they only had 3 servers and 1 bus boy and every table and chair in the house was taken.  We were told we would have to wait 5 minutes for a table, but 30 seconds later we were walked right in. As I mentioned, the place was PACKED and every single one of the servers had a glow about them from running around like crazy. They were HUSTLIN' and they did an impeccable job.   Because there were only about 3 servers on staff this day, each server was responsible for one third of the restaurant (and it is HUGE). Each of them was helping the other out; I saw them running one another's food, and clearing plates regardless of whose section it was.  Our food arrived moments after we ordered it, and despite the fact that the restaurant was slammed, everyone was very pleasant. They made sure to smile in between their sprints to and from the kitchen.  It was a wonderful experience dining at Mi Amigo's and we actually ended up going twice over the weekend because we enjoyed it so much.  This place deserves mad props. It's quick, it's cheap (we paid $15 for 3 people's lunch) and it most definitely hits the spot.",

But they will make semi-fresh guacamole at your table and bring you a mountain of chips that you can't refuse.   They were also pretty knowledgeable about what was gluten free on their menu.

The place was bad news from the very beginning.  The hostess was super unfriendly and looked as if she couldn't wait to get home. When I sat down at the table, a couple of bugs fell onto the table from the lamp shade overhead-- I should have gotten up then.  The chips were greasy, margaritas straight sugar w/ very little liquor and the enchiladas bland as can be. In addition to this, I got food poisoning and was up all night running to the bathroom.  You couldn't pay me to go back to this restaurant. It should be closed down immediately for its lack of cleanliness and poorly prepared food.",

I ordered the Shrimp & Scallop Enchiladas, which basically consisted of a couple stale tortillas covered with runny cheese, topped off with half a dozen miniature shrimps and scallops. Oh, and a small pile of cold beans and white (white, really?) rice. My date actually grimaced when they brought out the food - grimaced! - and said, \"You're not really going to eat that, are you?\"  We were in a drinking mood and surely would have spent good money doing it, but after she brought the food, we never saw the hot waitress again - Ever! - and I actually had to get up and ask another, much less attractive waitress for the bill.

But this is also why \"dinner and a movie\" is so popular.    So we would have some dinners at Mi Amigo's until the frightful night.  The night we ate at Mi Amigos and I ordered the tamale for the first time (usually I stick with tacos at Mexican food restaurants and I just love tacos).  It was delicious and I enjoyed every last bit of that tamale.  We go to the movie, he drops me off at home, I go to bed and am up at 4am with the taste of tamales in my mouth.  I feel like I might have indigestion, but NO. NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO-- I had my very first date with food poisoning.    You know the drill on this so I won't go into detail.  I can't give the place one star b/c of all the other times we went and had 2-3 star  food and decent service.  So I gave 2 stars but told you all that I got food poisoning here.  It really should be 1.5 stars.  The  worst part is I can never eat another tamale again, ever.  .",

He recommended the \"Canyon Cafe\" which is in the same exact mall/movie complex as this place, \"Mi Amigo's \" .  I reviewed the Canyon Cafe's menu and didn't care for it since it's more of a Fusion restaurant, not real Mexican food.  I told the hostess that I wanted more authentic food and she told me to try \"Mi Amigo's\" . I walked 100 feet to this place.  I have to say the server was a sweetheart...very friendly, welcoming - THAT's the ONLY thing I liked about this place, aside from the Cadillac Margarita for $5.75.  I ordered the tortilla soup.  OKish; free chips and salsa - the chips were awesome, the salsa mediocre.  The worst disappointment was my main course - I ordered the Red Beef Tamales.  These are the worst tamales that I remember eating.  I can make them better myself at home!! And I am an awful cook!  I was joined by one of our flight attendants and he joined me at my table.  He pretty much reached the same concensus as I.  Sorry, but I really, really was looking forward to a nice, hot tasty Mexican meal.  I was in Arizona for crying out loud, not in North Dakota or Maine, where Mexican food may not be as widespread.   PLEASE get your menu and most importantly your ingredients in order!  My colleagues at my airline stay across the street at the Sheraton and would appreciate a nice Mexican meal on our work trips.   Thanks !!",

In other words, intended for the typical white American who is unfamiliar with quality mexican faire.  I appreciated the provision of chips and salsa, and the gentleman who brought them was VERY considerate and kind to have brought individual salsa cups for each of the five of us.  But it was like pulling teeth to get more.  I ordered the pork taquitos from the appetizer menu. $6.25 for six cigarette sized items that were undoubtedly frozen ten minutes prior.  The items that others at the table ordered appeared to be tasty, and one fellow patron literally cleared the plate.  If I were in the area with out of town guests who wanted mexican, and they were not well versed in the faire, I'd take them here.  Otherwise we'd go elsewhere.",

I've had tacos, enchiladas, burritos and cheese quesos here. As pointed out in a previous review, the food here is very Americanized Mexican food. Everything is pretty bland and mild for Mexi-food. Bean and rice are your stereotypical refried bean and orange Mexi rice. The cheeses are a little greasy.   SERVICE  Our waitress was fantastic. She gets 5 stars. We had plenty of chips and salsa, and our drinks were never empty. She was friendly but not overly pushy.   AMBIANCE  If you're looking for quiet and romantic, don't come here. The restaurant is very open and the acoustics are awful. The decor is simple with Mexican flare, but not terribly gaudy.   OVERALL Great place for a quick downtown lunch if you don't mind Americanized Mexi-food that could be cheaper.",

    "text": "(Let me preface this review by saying that, being from Houston, I'm accustomed to eating authentic salsa, tacos, tamales, etc. My taste for Mexican food is most likely biased to a certain method or seasoning used around here.)   My waitress was quick to take my drink order once I was seated, and was attentive and sweet. I drank a \"Blue Amigo\", their house marg that is $2.50 all day every day. It was a bit sweet for my taste, but still okay.   Chips were great, but their \"salsa\" is what I know as pico de gallo. Luckily, I love pico, so it was all good.   On to the food - I ordered the Numero Tres, which is 2 beef or chicken tacos (I chose beef), rice, beans, and a cheese enchilada. First impression...this place makes a mean cheese enchilada. Like, GOOOOD. Their red gravy was probably the best I've ever had. Rice, delicious. Refried beans, amazing. Beef tacos...yuck. I can't help but think that the beef in these tacos tasted like dog food smells. It was more of a shredded beef...bland...and just had an overall odd taste. I only ate about 3/4 of a taco and called it a night. I'm used to well-seasoned ground beef tacos, and these were just bizarre, in my opinion.   Overall, great place! I would visit again next time I'm in Phoenix, bull I'll probably stay away from the beef.",

    "text": "Your basic Mexican restaurant.  Frankly, it would be a disappointment as a destination in and of itself, but it is a nice alternative for downtown Phoenix business luncheons or meeting friends before a Diamondback/Suns game. It would also work well for parents of the burgeoning number of ASU students downtown. You could meet junior at the Arizona Center without having to embarrass him/her with your presence on campus.   The restaurant has ample seating capacity for when events nearby bring in the crowds.  Seating outside is limited.  Service on this Saturday was slow, which seems to be a common occurrence. Chips and salsa were served promptly.  The chips are of the light white corn variety, but suffer from a stale mass produced quality.  The salsa was good, but our table requested an alternative sauce with a bit more zest.  It was much tastier and had almost an enchilada sauce quality.    Food served was uniformly consistent.  Not spectacular, but nothing to complain about.  We had an assortment of tacos and enchiladas.  The happiest diners at our table were the two youngsters who ordered cheese crisps from the kid's menu.  Not a Mexican restaurant to get excited about given the many alternatives around Phoenix, but a decent offering with lots of seating capacity in an area where restaurants tend to have no customers or too many to handle.",

Very tasty and very filing. Zucchini, spinach, carrots,, peppers, rice etc.. loved the variety of the ingredients. Mi amigos enjoyed their dishes as well. ( yes you get free chips and salsa to start- i know you were thinking about it).  They have happy hour 3-6 and indoor/outdoor seating as well.

We sat down and ordered our drinks the waitress was very kind and suggested a higher quality margarita for my sister since they didn't have patron... But seriously what kinda Mexican restaurant does not have Patron... Anyhoo, I ordered a Tecate and asked for a glass with Tajin (Mexican Chili lime powder) and they again told me they didn't have this.. Again I was shocked....This is something Mexican restaurants should have in stock at all times. Instead I got Dos Equis... We ordered or food and I swear they must have had these plates ready because they came out within 5 min... I got machaca chimichangas, my sister got Enchiladas... As expected it was pretty good... Decent I would say, but my mom makes them better. lol. The beans were good, but rice of course was boxed uncle bens rice.. I mean c'mon... Why even open a Mexican restaurant if your just going to not really offer real Mexican food. Overall I gave it a sideways thumb... If I was hungry and everywhere was closed I would come back, but if there was other options I would take those.",

The beef taco and cheese enchilada were a sweet deal at $5. Really nice flavor on the enchilada sauce. The folks who ordered the guacamole (prepared at your table) also enjoyed their food.  Finally, $2.95 for a bottle of Dos Equis Amber is a good deal but $2.95 for the big glass is a great deal!",

They have a blue margarita for $2.50...it's pretty sweet (not my favorite), but good value for a drink.    Service is usually good, typically they are attentive with drinks, chips, and bringing the bill.    If you remember the Matador downtown, this is a step down in all aspects of a resaurant except for maybe speed of service where it's a tie.  All in all - this is Phoenix, AZ.  You should not settle for mediocre Mexican food at above average prices, but for lack of options, this is an acceptable option.",

We walked in, and it was fairly empty. There was no host/hostess to seat us. It took about 10 mins for someone to show up. My colleague and I ordered the shrimp tacos, which were very underwhelming in taste and was not appealing to the eyes. Additionally, we asked for sour cream on the side, which is a typical condiment for a Mexican restaurant. The waitress did not indicate it was extra for the sour cream, so we were shocked to see the charges on our bills ($1.75 each). She also brought out 2 small bowls of sour cream before she brought out our meals. The customer service was highly lacking. Skip this place. Save your money and your taste buds. I'd give it zero stars if I could. 1 star is generous.",

I hedged my bet and order a couple of enchiladas ala carte.  At least those were tasty.  Service was kind of roller coastery.  The server took my drink order immediately and gave me a few minutes to peruse the menu.  Food came relatively promptly.  When she brought the bill, well she decided it was time to do a deep cleaning of the bar area while I sat and played solitaire on my phone.  Finally she came by only because she was dropping an order off at the table behind me.  The place was 3/4 empty, but I can attribute this to being 8pm on a Sunday night in downtown Phoenix.  In fact most of the mall was deserted and restaurants closed.  I end with one suggestion.  Lower the freekin light that is hanging over the table.  Nothing worse that having to catch the glint of a halogen bulb burning your eyes while you eat.",

Instead of giving us 6 bones they gave us 5. When we asked them about it, the waitress apologized and said that it was the last rack of ribs. The manager came to us and tried to joke his way out. Later, he offered us a 10% discount on the price of the ribs. The 10% discount was much less than the cost of that one single rib. We didn't care to argue with him. We just wanted to get out and never come back!   The waitress was polite while speaking to us but took our plates away before we could finish eating.",

I expected it to be a bit more upscale for the Arizona Center, but it reminded me of your run-of-the-mill Mexican places you can find everywhere.  Now don't get me wrong, it was delicious for a lunchtime choice and I'm glad I went because it was tasty but I just wouldn't go back. For one, the salsa was very chunky. Chunky in a way that it was all tomato, cilantro, onions, etc. But the chips served with were interesting in the fact that they were always hot out of the oven and were long tomale-like shapes rather than poured out of a bag. I got the Lunch Special #18 and my friends got #20 and #22. Whichever is the chulopa, get that one! Mine was just an enchilada with rice and beans and although it was the cheaper option on the menu, it wasn't exciting.  I would recommend this place is you're craving just some basic Mexican food and don't have a long lunch hour. I would ALSO suggest this place for HH. I didn't get to drink but they're specials looked bomb!",

We had to ask for extra because there wasn't much substance.   I ordered the sampler platter dish which came with a little bit of everything. The taquitos were yummy, but that was about it. I smothered most things with guacamole to make it edible and left about half the plate. My friend had the tacos and seemed just fine with them.

When I got hot I was shocked by the small portions, the stale chips and the \"crispy\" tacos that were soft taco shells. The WORST part besides the small portions was the quality. Tacos tasted bland, rice and beans tasted out of a can and the enchilada was bland and dry. Sauce also tasted out of a bottle. For the price I fill so ripped off. I have a Filbertos near me and for half the price I could have had better. AVOID AT ALL COST as they don't care.",

The service was extremely slow although the place was far from busy. The food was mediocre which was surprising for a Mexican restaurant in Pheonix, Arizona where southwestern food is quite popular. I got chicken fajitas. The presentation was nice, but food tasted just ok. Chips and dip were blah- chips were cold and not very appealing. Sour cream is extra? Not impressed. Would only recommend if you want some average Mexican food.",

Our server (Tyler) was pretty attentive for it being just his first week. My work badge accidentally fell off in the booth as I got up to leave and he was quick enough to catch me before I left to give it back - Good eye!  I went with the cheese enchiladas and definitely did not find it hard to gobble up. Savory red sauce paired with ooey-gooey cheese baked to perfection within a four tortilla..yum! Standard rice and beans as a side.  Most of my coworkers enjoyed their meals.. the only meal that received complaints were the fish tacos. The breaded fish tasted like and resembled that of a frozen fish stick - perhaps not so fresh?  This place is nothing super special but is a decent lunch if you work in the area. Glad I gave this place another shot!",

Sat down and in a couple of minutes, we were munching on good chips and salsa.  Servers came by and got our drink orders while our volleyball girls got to order their meals.  After sipping our tasty margaritas and chatting for a little bit, servers came back and got our food orders while they brought out the orders for our VB girls.  In less than 10 minutes, we all got our meals and dug in.  When everyone was done, almost every plate was empty...no doggy bags for the lot!  My wife and I shared the sampler and everything on it was good and filling.  Our daughters, who usually always leave something to take home, didn't leave anything behind.  After polling the group, looks like everyone was satisfied and said their meal was tasty and filling.  The group is from the San Diego area, so they know their Mexican food.  We had good food, great service, and left the restaurant with good feelings.  If we come back for the 2018 Volleyball Festival, you can rest assured that we will eat at this restaurant again.",

    "text": "Tiffany was our server. I had lunch here with 3 other people, and we had many problems. I was told 4 times that I would get chips and salsa. Our table did not get any drinks or chips until 20 minutes after we sat down. When my friend asked what was in the vegetable burrito, Tiffany shrugged her shoulders and said, \"Vegetables.\" Super unprofessional, and she needed to ask her supervisor to ask if she didn't know the answer. My friend had to list vegetables to make sure that certain one's weren't in the burrito. The four of us asked for margaritas. After we received the food, it took asking a table busser to get us silverware since Tiffany was nowhere to be found. We ate all of our food without receiving the second round of drinks we ordered, and when we were ready for the checks, she came over to check that we ordered drinks. My friends recieved their drinks, but I had ordered a short version of the drink, and I was told the 4 times I asked (one other server and the GM as well) that my short margarita was coming. It never came. I waited 15+ minutes for my drink before I cancelled the order. We got 4 separate checks, and 2 of us paid in cash. The 2 that paid with card had the cards clipped onto the checks. We didn't see her for 10+ minutes, and she came out to tell us that they ran the wrong cards for the orders. They had to fix it, and we left as soon as we got the receipts. We spent 2+ hours for 2 drinks and an entree, the 2 hours we were there were not my own personal choice. To be fair, it was the waitress' 3rd day, but that falls on management to properly train her, or have her shadow another server until she feels comfortable with the job. Very disappointed, as my previous experience at this restaurant was amazing: great service, great food, and a good atmosphere. Don't know what exactly went wrong here, but I sincerely hope they can resolve the issue before they lose out on potential business, like myself. Sorry guys, but I know a lot of restaurants in the area where I can get good food and much, much better service.",

Servers were attentive but didn't communicate well with each other ( asked for our order twice- wasn't sure who our server was.) Served American cheese with the food- is this Taco Bell?

There green chili enchiladas are great and can make changes if you need to. My server understood what we wanted and made it happen. The menu doesn't do its justice, you have to be there and taste the food.  Sopapillas are excellent dessert, again meets my taste buds and im sure it will meet yours too.

She had a chile relleno and i had the spinach, avocado, shrimp salad. I thought the salad was good, it comes with raspberry viniagrette that's pretty sweet, so I picked some of the shrimp off to eat them on the side since they were salty. The salad was pretty simple and small. If you're going to get a salad and you're hungry, I suggest ordering something else to go with it because it might not fill you up.  We also got a fried ice cream. We split it and really enjoyed it- it came out quickly and with two spoons.   I personally did not care for the chips and salsa. The salsa was okay, but thick, and the chips were very thin and broke easily.   Mi Amigo's is a very affordable Mexican option downtown. We had a good experience with the service, but none of the food really wowed me. We could walk from our hotel and that was a nice touch, too.",

The guacamole was outstanding.  The price was an incredible value. Wish we lived here so we could come every week!",

    "text": "This will not be your average sit down and eat dinner review. I was here with a large party of 30, after the weekend work event and people were definitely ready to drink and eat. I ordered a skinny margarita with Patron which I came to regret after tasting it. It was pretty gross. Everyone else seemed to like their house margaritas, which were also very cheap. Mine came to $14. Our appetizers were ordered for us, the chips and salsa were complimentary snd we ordered guacamole and cheese crisps -which is their version of quesadillas. The guacamole was good and they make it right in front of you in a bowl. It was just the right amount of spicy. People were complaining that the salsa was too hot, but I thought it was just right. The more authentic the better, in my opinion. I did not try the cheese crisps but everybody liked them and they looked good. I ordered the Mexican grilled chicken salad. I had already eaten so many chips I didn't want to feel worse about myself. The grilled chicken was amazing, there wasn't much the salad other than that. They only gave me two pieces of avocado. The chipotle ranch dressing was amazing, though. Everyone else's meals looked delicious and the portions are huge. Honestly, you can get one plate and share it with someone, for sure. Then, they brought out a Mexican dessert and everybody seem to like that, but most people were too full to even entertain the idea of dessert. I thought it was interesting that the restaurant is called Mi Amigos, when in Spanish it should translate into Mis Amigos. I asked one of our servers, and he told me that the owners are American and made a mistake but that restaurant has been open for 20 years. I found that a little odd but interesting. Overall, the environment is pretty fun it is your typical Mexican style restaurant. Take it or leave it. It's located in the middle of the Arizona Center, so pretty easy to get there if you are in the downtown Phoenix area. Prices are very reasonable. Enjoy!",

And, their prices are crazy for the non-ambiance they create. I can pay $20+ for fajitas in a nicer, more inviting setting. I'm shocked if college students (or anyone, really) patronize this place much unless they offer half off meal specials- eek!  We reviewed the menu ahead of time on their website and when we actually visited (after a 30 minute drive) we were disappointed they didn't offer what we intended to order. We left- if the setting is lacking and quite dated, I don't want to know how the food tastes.   The best thing about this place was the friendly and pleasant staff.",

We waited for over 10 minutes before being acknowledged at our table and in fact had two tables seated and ordered before we had water. I am very forgiving if the place is busy, but this was not the case. Food was marginal, waiter apologetic. But, my biggest complaint was the bathroom. It was gross and I am truly hopeful that the employees have their own bathroom with readily available soap. As the picture may not show, the soap in the opened container is watered down. It appears as though it had not been cleaned for awhile, and according to the log, it had been over 2 days. Yuck.",

The taco shell was greasy and limp, like something made by a stoned teenager as a 3:00 a.m. snack. Yes, I ate it anyway, as like I said, I was starving. However, I very deeply regretted eating any of it later. So if you would like some terrible food, followed by regret and a need to be alone, this would be a great place for you.",

Mis Amigos in Arizona Center was a covnenient choice for lunch downtown.  It was a late lunch (like 1:30) so the place was mostly empty and the hostess didn't seem too pleased to see us.  She brushed off my charming jokes and sat us in a nearby booth.  The hostess was actually the downside of the service - everyone else was quite prompt and pleasant.  Unfortunately, the service was the best aspect of our lunch at Mis Amigos.  Before ordering the carne asada torta, I asked the server if it was good and she insisted it was.  What came out of the kitchen was warmed-over, chopped steak on a sub roll - not the soft, authentic torta roll I was expecting.  Other than \"carne asada sauce\" there was nothing else on the sandwich - no guacamole, no tomato, no nothing.  Disappointing.  The tableside guacamole was also disappointing.  Even though the waitress prepared it - as you would expect - tableside, it was bland.  The guac definitely needed salt, maybe a little lemon or lime juice, but something to give it some flavor.  Maybe I was expecting too much, but I certainly wouldn't recommend Mis Amigos to mis amigos.",

There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, and this one doesn't top the list, but if you are in downtown Phoenix, and confined to that area, it's not bad.

    "text": "One star.  I am shocked!  Of all the Mexican restaurants I've written about, none has ever received less than three stars.  That's how blessed we are in Arizona.  Even a pathetic \"Mexican\" restaurant I dined at in Ohio got two more stars than Mi Amigos.  Last week, I ignored the reviews and decided to give Mi Amigos a shot because it was conveniently located near the movie theater at Arizona Center.  Never ignore Yelp!  First impressions are important and this place screwed up twice before the entrees arrived.  Mi Amigos is a big place and it was nearly empty.  It was dinner time on a Wednesday so I ignored this, but my friend and I couldn't ignore the fact that the chips we were served had a funny aftertaste.  The salsa was decent but the chips tasted like they were cooked in some bad oil.  Our entrees came out very quickly which tells me the kitchen wasn't terribly busy.  When I first saw my plate, I was pleasantly surprised because it looked pretty good.  I was wrong.  As I dug in, it quickly became obvious that the cabbage on the plate wasn't cut on site.  Seriously, cabbage out of a bag!?  It looked like the pulverized stuff you get in salad mix and if anyone labored over this, they were picking the lettuce and carrots out.  This is seriously disappointing.  My combination included a taco, a green corn tamale, rice and beans.  The taco was decent but nothing special.  Since they don't cut their own cabbage, I think it's a safe bet they don't make their own beans.  They were okay.  The rice was so bland I didn't even finish it.  Now about that tamale.  This was the driest green corn tamale I have ever eaten.  And it was smothered in a green sauce with a sour cream drizzle that resembled white Easy Cheese.  Most green corn tamales that I've eaten don't have meat in them.  This tamale had some mysterious substance in the middle that looked like pork but chewed like cheese.  In a word, it was odd.  My friend's entree also disappointed.  He didn't finish his tamale but I sampled it.  The sauce wasn't typical canned tamale sauce, but it still had a funky taste to it.  We attributed it to the tortilla being cooked in the same bad oil.  In an effort to put this meal out of my mind, a couple days later, I dined at a local favorite (rhymes with Carolina's) where I enjoyed some Chile Verde with rice and beans.  It cost about five dollars less than my entree at Mi Amigos and earned exactly four stars more.  Life is too short to eat poorly executed Mexican food.",

I paid 10.75 to sit in a Mexican restaurant that serves Pace salsa as your chip and dip, canned green salsa on their nachos. I wouldn't come to this place again if I were paid to do so. Garbage Managment. The 7 people I was with agreed with me. Also, the manager didn't have the nerve to come apologize or say anything about the food after having complained. The bartender/server told me after giving me my check. It's unfortunate having been a server, that's Management's job. But hey, you keep doing you mi amigos and keep pretending you are a Mexican restaurant.",

Come to think of it, I think I had better food at Rubio's for cheaper.  We were at an event downtown and this was this only place that didn't seem to busy although we still had to wait. I don't think there were enough staff.  I got a drink but it wasn't strong or anything. Somewhat watered down. And the chips and salsa... sooooo meh. I guess if you're literally dying from hunger, this place will suffice. Otherwise, go to Taco Bell. Or Del Taco. Or any place with the word Taco in it.",

Food was okay and I would of probably came back an recommended this place but after such a bad experience not only will I not go back but I will make sure everyone is AWARE!!  When it was time to pay the waitress switched my 100.00 bill for a fake one, I had just gotten money out from the bank, my cash was brand new crispy bills that where all same in size, well my bill came up to about $115.00 total I pulled out 2 brand new 100.00 bills, she came back with manager saying one of them was fake! To make story short, my husband decided we would leave and take matters differently since we couldn't get this resolved there and because we had friends from out of town visiting Phoenix for the first time, we didn't want them to get bad impression.   So here I am now making sure people are aware that when you visit this place you are taking the risk of been ripped off/ stolen. So this been said I've done my part by warning you ( the reader). Please you're self a favor and go else where.",

It wasn't, but this was the next closest place.  In hindsight, I wish we would've eaten at Subway.  I'm a vegetarian and while I understand that lard is used in beans often and chicken stock is used to make rice, does it really have to be used to fry the chips? (Spoiler: it is here. They guy told me, but not before I figured it out for myself)  I tasted one and immediately knew. It leaves a film on your tongue that's just so gross. They were not good.  I had a vegetarian burrito (they have a white rice and black bean alternative, so that was nice). It was absolutely mediocre. I wanted enchiladas but didn't trust the sauce, so stuck with the burrito.  My husband had some combo and my kids split an appetizer quesadilla that came with a small garnish of cabbage but not the usual suspects of a dollop of sour cream, guacamole or salsa.   The water tasted odd even. The only thing I can definitely say in their favor is that they were so speedy with service. We were in an hurry and because they weren't busy, we were in and out in a flash. The service was totally fine.  It was our fault for not leaving enough time for an adequate dinner, but it hurt to spend $37 on food we didn't even really like and had to consume in 25 minutes total.",

I was absolutely appalled  at her denial of the flat and warm beer,  and on lack of willingness to fix the situation. Ive been longtime customers of this place, but now we finally have decided we just don't think we can come back. In the summer their air conditioning doesn't work very well and the restaurant itself is also very uncomfortable and just way too warm to sit in. Now that the summer is over and it's cool down we thought it would be a great time to go but now their beer sucks! And they don't have anyone in there competent running the bar.",

We would have asked for to go cups and grabbed one for the road were such things permissable.  Everything else about the place was good as well.  Not overly expensive, service was fine, the outdoor patio was nice - even if we were subjected to the oldies radio blaring from the Uno's patio next door.

I consistently go to Mi Amigo's for lunch.  I could eat there every day and never get tired of the food.  Their menu offers many great selections for lunch, dinner and/or Happy Hour.  The food is delicious and the chips and salsa are usually what entice me to to eat there more than once in a week.  If by Friday of each week, I haven't been there, I tell my co-workers that \"I need my fix\" and they know exactly what I mean.  Every waiter/waitress is so pleasant.  They are all so accommodating, full of smiles, and they make our lunch experience great EVERY SINGLE TIME!  We enjoy the outdoor seating when the weather is nice.  There are affordable lunch options, and if you don't like something, they'll gladly make you something else you want.  And lastly, Chris, the day manager, ROCKS!  :-)",

I ordered the Chili Rellano. A large Pablano pepper stuffed with chunks of chicken and typical fillings. It was dipped and fried in a panko bread crumb -like batter which I really liked compared to the \"traditional\" egg batter. It was thin and light. Great tasting to.  Service was excellent. I was never left wanting for a refill of my tasty beverage and they kept the salsa and hot sauces full as well as the tortilla chips. The chips were good too. They were light and tasted fresh. Not the out-of-a-bag corn chips. I will be back.",

The young man that took our order I don't think was even a server. He got every one of our orders wrong. Everything went back. I went to the restroom and I heard a server say to the bartender that they have never been so busy on a Saturday. What? This was 4:30 in the afternoon! Once we got our food nobody came by and asked how was everything. We needed our water refilled and I actually had to track down someone to get the refill. They offered us free fried ice cream for the inconvenience and we politely declined! Ugh! What mess this place is! Stay away, stay far away from this place!",

    "text": "let me start by saying...any place that offers 77% off your meal, just for being born in the year 1977 is alright by me! that's right, last week was the 32nd year anniversary for the Restaurant, located around AZ, so they offered several super cheap deals on some great food! We were there on the day of the 77% discount and my seester and i ate like hogs for $12.50, of which $6.50 was my mango margarita (arriba arriba! so tasty) i had the cheese enchilada, chicken hard taco, tortilla soup and of course many a chip and salsa y creama (sour cream) the rice was delicious as always, the soup devine (the broth was made with red enchilada sauce). the chicken taco wasn't my favorite (sorry my ma makes the best) because of the ground chicken pattie type of thing that was fried in the tortilla shell. on the other hand, my sister said the chicken taco has been her favorite for the past 10 years that we've been eating there. oh yeah secrets out of the bag in this review....the salsa served here is the best hang over cure you can find in AZ, not sure why, and it might even be the chips, but they work wonders!   so the manager said earlier in the week of the anniversary, the numero uno was the same price as the day the restaurant first opened, but we missed that day. next year they will do the same, but take my word and don't wait,  the food was still very reasonably priced for everyday meals, and the happy hour is a local secret, one that is packed with cheap tasty treats, refreshing drinks and the tastiest salsa served with light crispy chips, i could fill up on those alone (and believe me there have been many a time i have!) enjoy this rare authentic treasure hidden in a tourist mall (go figure).  my only complaint is the lack of room in my stomach after that free basket of chips and the delicious salsa they pushed on me- which was actually very welcomed lol.",

    "text": "Last night we had a group of people so we hit Mi Amigo's in the Arizona Center since we were staying nearby. Most of the group are on limited funds, so we thought a pretty tasty chain would be ok. Now as I write this there are things that make me want to bump it to a four then other things that make me want to bump it down.  Let's see... I wasn't sure what to order and everything looked just about average in terms of dishes, so I ended up with Chile Rellenos. I rarely ever get this, so I figured tonight would be the night. Our waitress took forever to come over at first and I felt like she wasn't completely with it. She may be bilingual and a little less with the English, so she was very very quiet. She got half our table drinks and then disappeared. Eventual she came back with the others, but she could've fit them all on one tray. A few more minutes and we had some tasty albeit boring looking chips. They were so large that they could only get so many in each bowl. The salsa was terrible. Completely bland with little taste. Mostly it was chunks of tomatoes and some juice. Boring. After way too long our food came. No silverware or anything, just the food. I ate most of my beans with a knife (it looked clean!) I found on my table. We asked for sourcream and silverware. She brought the sour cream but nada on the whole silverware thing. Eventually someone found me a fork (I think from a place setting behind me) and I dug in. Great Chile Relleno! very tasty, and I think the sourcream made it for me. At the end of the meal, the waitress did agree to split the check between each of us to her defense, but overall it was a very average experience like you'd expect from a white-washed pseudo Mexican chain.",

The tortilla wasn't crispy enough. Not a good meat to veggie to tortilla ratio. Rice and beans were good though.

Chips, bland but texturally good. Salsa, canned, fake and simply unacceptable. This is the point where I should have ran for the exit. I reluctantly ordered an asada taco only to be asked \"you mean a steak taco?\" My second cue to run for the door.  Then the food came. The beans are either freeze dried or frozen and oddly nutty. I perceive this at their very poor attempt to shine up a ball of fecal matter. The rice, meh, but edible. The asada or \"steak\" at this MEXICAN restaurant, a saucy mess. I'll spare you all the rest of this mess of a meal.  Oh, my official Tip for this restaurant: If you must eat here, come for happy hour, have 8-10 of their margaritas then order something. Hopefully by this time you'll be too inebriated to know what you're eating.",

Waitress never came by to our table to check and see if we needed anything, not even to refill our waters! Even after getting our checks the Waitress took forever to come and pick it up. A lot of the staff just stands in the back by the kitchen talking to one another instead of checking to see if their guests are doing alright. As someone traveling from out of state I did not find this restaurant to be very welcoming. Didn't even get a \"Thanks for stopping by, come again!\" The staff was preoccupied with making conversation with each other rather than with customers.",

The freshest thing we had was the free chips and salsa. The staff was very nice and friendly but the food wasn't any good. Just thought I'd let people know.",

    "text": "Mi Amigos is one of my favorite Mexican Food restaurants for two simple reasons. 1. I love the chips & salsa and 2. They have my all time favorite chile relleno.  The Chips & Salsa Mi Amigos gives you some of the largest chips I've come across.  They are little half tortillas that are crisp and simple.  The salsa is heavy on the cilantro, but its chunky with good flavor.  I'm all about the big chunks of tomato in my salsa.  MY FAVORITE CHILE RELLENO I've been ordering this big beast of a relleno stuffed full of chicken for years.  The chicken inside is simply grilled chicken and its covered in some gooey cheese.  The pepper is a little bit random in heat - sometimes I sweat like a B while shoveling away, and sometimes it's rather mild. The batter they cook it in is different than most rellenos, its sort of crumby and dark, but delicious.  The sauce is some simple looking orange sauce with some sour cream in it - sorry, I can't cook so my skills in ingredient identification suck - I just know it's delicious!  My favorite.  I order it every time I'm there.  I visit this Mi Amigos every time I'm in the area looking for food.  I can't remember the last Arizona Center place I ate at other than Mi Amigos.  I have to have the relleno any time I'm near.",

    "text": "Personally, I like Mi Amigo's, but the general consensus seems to be that it's just OK.  The reason I give it 4 stars is because every time I come here I have a good experience. The food is always good, the drinks are good (especially happy hour drinks), the staff is friendly, it's never too busy or crowded.  I really like their enchiladas, but some of their food is a little \"Americanized\". For example, their chicken quesadillas are literally just chicken and cheese. Most authentic Mexican places I go to put in pepper jack or onions into their quesadillas. But like I said, that doesn't really bother me because the food is still awesome.  Also, if you park in the AZ Center parking garage, they WILL validate your parking :)  It's nothing fancy or special, but for a generic Mexican restaurant their food and drinks are really good. Friendly staff too. Would recommend it to anyone!",

Only CON was that CON had just closed for the evening and nerds flooded the place causing a shortage of Mr. Pibb and delayed our meal since they were so busy.  I overheard staff talking to manager about running out of other items on menu.  Staff was pretty happy about closing early because of it.  I don't blame them!

Once we did get to order, we opted to share the tortilla soup and the chicken fajitas. The tortilla soup was really bad. It tasted like a mix of chili powder and salt. We ended up sending it back. The chicken fajitas were actually ok, but not great.   The real downer was the service. Waitstaff appeared to be fairly apathetic about the place. Limited interested in actually taking our order, bringing out food, etc..  Overall, there are much better choices. You should look elsewhere if you are hungry for Mexican food.",
