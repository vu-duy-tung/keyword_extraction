Anyhoo, I love their iced coffee!! I thought Starbucks was strong, this blows them out of the water, great coffee. I had the Breakfast burrito, it was huge. I was hoping by the menu it would be great, it was ok, the sausage was ok, they did use alot of different types of potatoes, sweet, russet and some type of purple kind so it pretty much sucked up all the moisture out of the burrito. The salsa on the side was average but was not nearly enough for the whole burrito. I would suggest the iced tea..soooo good. It is a great little place, especially when they open the doors and luckily a breeze blows in. They are also pet friendly.",

    "text": "Luci's is a great little neighborhood spot. They have a coffee bar that offers great lattes and teas, etc... The staff is awesome, not sure why some reviewers seem to think otherwise. They are friendly, remember your name and always show a sense of urgency. The parking is pretty tight, so you might have to circle around the back of the shopping center once or twice. The menu offers some great sandwiches and salads, as well as some special diet options. They have some gluten-free items on the main menu and I believe they have the same in dessert/pastry items. One of my favorite things is breakfast and it's offered all-day at Luci's! The marketplace portion itself is pretty cool, not huge, but has a decent amount of shelf space to hold products usually found at Whole Foods. Lots of seating room and they have a big rolling garage-style door that opens the cafe area to the outside. It's especially nice in the spring and fall times. Beer and wine are also available in their coolers and they have dairy items as well. They also sell random funny things all over the place. Sarcastic magnets and notepads, etc... Check this place out, it's definitely worth a shot!  Tip: For quicker service, call in your order ahead of time!",

I ate food there twice, once was when they first opened, so I'll not write about that, as I'm sure they were working out hiccups. the second time was breakfast.  I just had that muffin, but my boyfriend had a breakfast burrito. the potatoes were undercooked and it was just a mass of scrambled eggs with little flavor.  he won't eat there again, so it'll be a while before I try to eat there again.   I hope the quality of the food improves, as I really like having cool places to eat near the house. I gave them an extra star for being in my hood.",

    "text": "Went to Luci's recently with the wife for a mid-week breakfast.  I had thought that the food was going to be just pastries/bagels/etc. but was pleasantly surprised to see they offered 'hot' food.  We both ordered egg/cheese/bagel sandwiches, mine had turkey included with the eggs.  Each also got a coffee.    The food was good, pretty good sized portion and I thought it was a pretty good value, but my wife and I liked ours.  The coffee was fine, nothing spectacular, but there were four different varieties, including some organic choices, which I liked.  I did not like that the labeling was not great on the creamers, which lead me to having skim milk instead of half/half.  (Probably mostly user error, I'll admit).    Loved the garage door that was open.  Perfect weather for it, the temperature was great and gave a nice feel.  What I did not like was one of the side effects...flies, and lots of them.  Not sure if there is some way around this (fans?) and also if this is some sort of cleanliness issue (I've certainly been to other places with patios recently that did not have flies buzzing around me the whole meals...don't get me wrong, it wasn't a plague of flies, but near constant buzzing around my food).  The second thing I did not like was the music.  Oh, the selection was fine, but I'm not sure why they had it so loud, kind of annoying.  Plus, in the morning if you have news channels on your tv's in your coffee shop, maybe you could put that audio over the speaker?  Anyways, solid 3.5 for Luci's, though I'm rounding down to 3 stars for the flies/noise.  Might be back, but not sure.",

My latte had a little heart in foam on the top. The service people were so friendly, but I feel like they should know more about what a big deal you are :) I had to educate them! I could put together a powerpoint if you'd like (kidding). The place was neat and tidy but had a nice warm quality to it. They had the convertible doors open so the breeze was really fitting for a late morning pastry-brunch.\"  A friend and I skipped the gym and went over to Luci's to celebrate my birthday and the Wicked pastries now being featured. We split a cinnamon roll and a red velvelt mini-cake (because according to Slade cupcake are out of fashion). The atmosphere was clean but cozy, the coffee was delicious and served with a smile. As far as the pastries... it's Slade. You can't go wrong. Luci, the owner, was outgoing and interested in our opinions of the place. Overall, it was a lovely experience. I hope to return soon for an actual meal or maybe to take a cooking lesson.",

The emphasis is on healthy, local and eco-friendly food and products. They introduced me to Marilyn's tortilla chips and Simply Bread's cranberry walnut bread - big fan of both!!! Of course they have some fantastic gourmet items like my favorite cahill porter cheese and other indulgences as well.   There is a \"community wall\" where you can post your fliers for car washes, walkathons, workshops, garage sales, etc. They've been open for about two months and the wall looks like it's getting some good use.  My friend created the logo, signage and color palette for the store. I love his work and how it all comes together to make this a very welcoming neighborhood market. Now I just wish is was in MY neighborhood.",

I have to echo Laura E. - I'm in love! The big garage door was wide open and I ordered my coffee in the gorgeous morning sunshine (which probably doesn't help my already bad case of spring fever) while the adorable barista boys chatted with me about my St. Patty's Day.   The best part was looking across the street at the Starbucks crammed with 30 cars in the drive-thru and knowing that my morning was likely to be more lovely and peaceful at Luci's.   I love Luci's for their nice ambiance, unique products, warm and welcoming service and because it's a perfect location for where I live and work.   One final note - they sell Full Sail Session Lager from my home state of Oregon that I absolutely love. I'll be back soon for lunch, and hopefully my four stars will become five!",

I tried describing Luci's to a friend and came up with \"sort of mini-Trader Joe's, health food but not really, some gourmet stuff, little bit of produce, organic soaps and vitamins, meals-to-go coffee bar.\" My friend's response was \"Sounds like an identity problem\".   I'm not really sure what is going to shine at Luci's...the coffee bar service has been mediocre (another customer and I had to sort out our drink orders when she was given both of ours and I was served nothing) and the coffee content in the soy latte is disturbingly low. The one grab-n-go item I tried (eggplant lasagna) was nice but not outstanding. The baked goods are tasty but I'm trying to limit intake of those. The selection of gourmet imported items (particularly Italian) is small but high quality, and same for the produce. Will there be enough of anything to make me a regular? Hard to say...   The atmosphere is one area of excellence - I love the retro/modern decor, the openness of the place and the little details like the glass tile accents. Unfortunately the seating area fills up quickly and I haven't been able to get a seat yet. Unless you are there very early or off peak hours, don't count on eating in.  If they ever expand their breakfast menu beyond bakery items, they will really need to think about how to accommodate more seating.",

It's so nice to drive down the street and see the big glass garage doors open, with people drinking coffee in the morning, and enjoying  live music in the evenings. Their staff is great, and the owners seem very kind as well.  I gotta say that I haven't tried anything freshly made at Luci's that blew me away, EXCEPT the blueberry sour cream muffin.  Holy Cow, it's delicious!  Luci's also has descent coffee, which I will always choose over the Starbucks across the street. I'm slightly addicted to their bottomless helpings of iced pomegranate green tea, which is a proprietary blend just for them.  Luci's is a great alternative to the somewhat shady liquor stores and aging Basha's along 16th street to get a nice bottle of wine and/or an interesting microbrew.  You can also purchase a single beer, if you just need a single cold one after a long day.  I give it 3 stars b/c the \"healthy marketplace\" offerings are uninspired and overpriced. As I mentioned I haven't had anything there that knocks my socks off.  I just think that the standards need to be higher with respect to simple food that awakens your taste buds.  There's a lot of potential there, and I just want them to go for it!",

I now have to put this in the rotation for food, as the Cobb Salad I enjoyed at lunch was superb, with an avocado citrus dressing that was perfect, and accompanied by a great green tea Arnold Palmer. My dining companion had the pancakes and raved about them as well. Already looking forward to my next visit to explore more of the menu, and grab an iced mocha while I'm at it.",

They have some vegan options, but only one item labeled as vegan on the menu, the Humm Dinger Vegan Wrap, and it's okay, but kind of boring.  So the only draw for me would be the coffee bar. It's not a place we would drive out of our way to go to, but if we are in the area, we'd stop here for a change.  When the weather is nice and the garage doors are open, it's a nice place to hang out while you eat.",

    "text": "I've been excited to review Luci's all day since visiting for breakfast this morning. I've been frequenting Luci's for quite some time and the experience has always been really great, but today especially just impressed me.  First of all, you should know that Luci's is one of those *hot* Phoenix spots - a truly unique community offering, quite unlike anything else in the area. In addition to being a \"coffee shop\", Luci's has a full market including food, supplies, beer, wine, and even toys!  The food and drinks they serve are really very good, albeit somewhat expensive. (I never mind the cost, though, because the overall experience is always so solid.)  Today, the place was pretty packed. As in: nowhere to park, all seating taken, and a long (and growing!) line just to order. My friend and I almost turned around and went somewhere else just to avoid the crush of people, but I'm glad we didn't.  The line actually moved pretty quickly and we were met by a very bright, positive young lady at the register. She was very excited about Luci's and very excited about vegetables. Haha! I regret not having gotten her name. She was great.  Surprisingly, we were able to snag a table.  **AND NOW, TIME FOR A SHOUT-OUT TO HANNAH & MORGAN:  In an effort to keep this email somewhere shy of book-length, I won't go into all the reasons why two servers in particular really impressed me, but I will say that the service that Hannah and Morgan provided was ON POINT. And not just for us, but for EVERYONE! These two were so quick and so positive and so attentive, even to what I would have considered to be \"problem customers\" - I was truly blown away.  THANK you, Hannah and Morgan, for being such bright and positive influences today. Thank you for making my day. And thank you, Luci's, for hiring awesome people.  If you haven't been to Luci's, you need to stop reading long reviews like this one and just go already. You'll love it. Maybe I'll even see you there!  ;)",

Ordering is done in line, which helps the crowd to move quickly.  The only downside could be finding a table during busy periods.  On top of that, it has a really cool neighborhood market attached as well.  Parking can be a struggle as well, due to the corner location,  but trust me, worth the little bit of effort to check this place out.",

    "text": "I was so thrilled when the BF took me here for breakfast today. It is so rare that we get to enjoy a morning together with our hectic lives. The menu looked delicious- and the Eggs Benedict special that my BF ordered was great. In no way, would I consider it \"healthy\" though... lol! Loaded in delicious fat... The employees were polite as well- even though the place was packed.  I ordered the kale salad... This is where things went very down hill... it was covered in oil. No dressing, but olive oil. There was so much oil on the salad that it pooled on the plate. I rarely send anything back, but it was inedible.   They took it back and brought me out a new plate that almost looked like the same exact salad...  I ate about half of the salad- again oil pooled on the plate, but my mouth was so coated with olive oil, I was starting to feel sick. I could feel it on my lips, my chin... absolutely DISGUSTING!  Since this is what they gave us after I already sent it back for too much oil... I didn't want to complain again. I really dislike having to do that, especially since the place was very busy.  I ended up using about 27 napkins... I am NOT exaggerating.  I used about 27 napkins to ring out the kale, so that the dish would be edible. We had a huge pile of oil soaked napkins all over our table. My hands were also soaked with oil... It was ridiculous. Even the people sitting at the table next to us were shocked by the amount of oil... it was really awful. Even after using 27 napkins to soak up some of the oil... the rest was still very oily... it was just a little more tolerable. Although the employees were very polite here, they did see what was happening with the salad, but never offered to fix the plate again- and made sure not to ask how our meal was when we purchased a few miscellaneous items before departing.   We spent about $50-60 there this morning, between food and trinkets... I'm really disappointed that such a highly regarded establishment messed up so epic on something as simple as a salad.  Additionally, I ordered that salad as I have been trying to eat healthier, but since there was definitely more than 4 tablespoons of olive oil on the salad... that salad ended up being over 600 calories... which is such a bummer.  For that amount of calories and fat, I would have rather had the eggs benedict or something a heck of a lot tastier than a kale salad. I should have just not eaten it, but I wanted to enjoy the rare breakfast out with the BF.   I don't think we will come here again because of this experience.",

And, looking to support local business, I decided to switch up my morning routine from the always packed, never enough parking and long line drive-thru, Starbucks across the street.   That said, I stopped into Luci's quite a few times the past month for my morning fuel (not just as a weekend treat) only to find no waiting. Good start but perhaps a little telling now that I have tested my hypothesis of coffee stops.    I don't mind a little conversation while ordering but to repeat my order three times....I am wondering if I am speaking Italian and don't realize it.  Don't get me wrong, the baristas are friendly but I don't need to be made aware of every detail that the night crew didn't clean up or prep for the morning or that it's \"a little too early to be up and moving\" at 7:15am. Is that not the shift for those of you that make up part of our morning routine when I am more than willing to fork over $4.97 for a large iced coffee with some sugar free vanilla syrup? Just sayin'.   I love the store, concept and the coffee...but for just an OK experience, I might go back to making my coffee at home and putting that money in my vacation fund.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I want to love and adore Luci's. But I can't.  I love the atmosphere, the knick knacks, and the grocery section. I love the windows and open garage doors and patio area. I love their concept. But unfortunately, I haven't loved the food. I am vegetarian,  not vegan, but still pretty strict and my guy is a meat eating, Nebraska man. The there are plenty of choices to satisfy everyone's needs. Vegan, vegetarian, gluten free,  local...but they are hit or miss. On our first visit I ordered a Naughty nurse, and my bf ordered a non memorable sandwich.  We both got potato salad for our sides. And an iced latte. My sandwich was good, I'd eat it again, and I enjoyed the potato salad. .it was light and dill-y,  but slightly bland. My guy's sandwich was ok, but nothing he remembered as being yum. He didn't care for the potato salad at all. The coffee was good and pretty good sized..no complaints there. Today's visit..not so great. I ordered the fresh kale salad..which they should rename \"the dentist special\". The description says kale, tomatoes, almonds, parmesean,  lightly dressed in lemon and olive oil.  The plate looked gorgeous. .so pretty and bright and fresh..the first few bites were nice...and then it started...this salad must have had 2 cups of roughly chopped almonds in it. Every bite was mouthfuls of almonds..i started to dig around. .more almonds..after getting about a quarter of the way through the salad I had to stop eating.  My tooth was zinging from a particularly hard almond and my jaw, was tired from chewing.  I started to dig out the almonds and separating them. ..i had at least a cup and a half of almonds on my plate. My boyfriend tried the salad and said it tasted like \"cardboard easter basket shreds\". Let's move on to his meal..the \"famous natural burger\". It comes on a brioche bun, with tomatoes and a pickle spear on the side, topped with bacon, grilled onions and mushrooms and cheddar cheese.  He ordered it medium rare with a side of fruit (For me). The burger was well done, but still juicy. But a strange thing happened. .it was dry. Like oddly, dry. He squeezed the meat and you could see juice,  but it was like the bun soaked it up and absorbed it. It came without any sauce, so he added mustard, quite a bit, and it was still so dry. The fruit side was pineapple, cantaloupe and honey dew. It was all hacked up and odd, like a child prepared it. But it was fresh, and after the Easter grass nut salad and dry burger, it was refreshing.  The atmosphere is great..like the perfect, busy coffee house cafe. There are students, business people, ladies who lunch, couples, kids, hipsters, hippies, and the occasional metal head couple (us). The staff is great. Always super friendly. They have a large selection of groceries and to-go food. And a wide variety of coffee and tea drinks. Plus all kinds of cool crap for sale..kitschy lip gloss, \"vintage-y\" kids toys, more stuff than I can even remember.  I just wish the food was more reliable. Will we go again..probably.  would I recommend it...to certain people, yes. If they can iron out the kinks, it would be a 5 star place..",

After receiving great service while ordering, I waited...and waited...and waited for my three egg omelet.  I had to finally ask about it and when it arrived?  ICK!  Brown, dry omelet, and the potatoes were like hockey pucks.  Really pretty bad, I thought.  Disappointing because place definitely has atmosphere.",

    "text": "I always feel a sense of guilt having to write a less than stellar review after meeting the owner of a restaurant.   Lucia was Beautiful and sweet, and a pleasure to meet, my lunch, however, was not fit to eat.   I ordered the THE HUMM-DINGER VEGAN WRAP: Roasted artichoke, zucchini, red bell pepper, onion, fresh spinach and hummus with a balsamic reduction drizzle, with a side of fruit and the sun dried tomato wrap.   Notice it says \"Roasted\", the cashier told me the Veggies were \"Grilled\". Unfortunately, to my dismay, they were neither.   Everything inside was heated up, by either stove or microwave, I'd guess the latter, and the \"Sun Dried Tomato Wrap\" was thin, doughy and utterly flavorless, not to mention a shocking pink color, which I'm sure was due to being naturally colored with beet juice, but did not help make things anymore appetizing. The fruit was a soggy pile of your typical pre-cut cantaloupe, honey dew mix.   It was not what I was expecting AT ALL, when I think of a grilled veggie wrap, I imagine tasting all those veggies bursting with flavor after caramelizing on the grill, they had no flavor though. I also did not expect the temperature to be Hot, chilled would have been better in my opinion if the veggies had actually bee grilled that is.   This lunch to me was less than average and as I sat there will my full plate in front of me I was asked how my meal was, I clearly stated my concerns as I have here and was simply told that it was a \"Best Seller\".   Lucia did send over a piece of chocolate cake, which was appreciated, but unfortunately missed the mark since I'm Vegan and the desserts aren't.   Honestly, in my opinion, aside from the market, most of the menu items are anything but healthy.   The 3 stars is for the market, my food would have been 1.  And that folks is why I am the Lunch Snob!",

    "text": "How can you not love this place??!! 'Goodness for Goodness sake!' and it really feels like that sometimes. When you are out and about needing some lunch and the thought of other fast food places just curls your stomach.. This place, for me, is like a oasis in the desert. I can pretty much just point to anything on the menu and know that I will recognize everything on my plate. Good quality products and the little store is full of recognizable health food brands at reasonable prices. I recognized many things that are lower than Whole Foods! Definitely right on par with Sprouts, but more of a small-town local feel. I love the staff!!! Never hesitating to stop and give encouraging comments or advice on products. All of them super friendly! I can't go often because I live in Gilbert but my grandma lives nearby so I just can't wait everytime I come see her.   I can see that there is probably lots of people who want lots of stuff for free and to them I say.. Go ahead and get your 10 boxes of pop tarts for $10.. I'll take Luci's and real food any day. Keep up the good work and if you ever open a second location please consider Gilbert!! Note about the parking: it was crowded both times and both times I did have to circle round back and then back up front but always parked with maybe 2 minutes.   I have only ever been for lunch but have loved every minute, every bite, every coffee sip and every bit of small talk with the staff.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love Luci's. Sadly, I did not.   My parents are old, really old. Due to their chronic old-ness, they tend to have inflexible habits. Since I am not old, I don't share many of these routines.   They like coffee, I drink tea. They need dessert whereas I don't eat sweets. On a recent weekend visit I decided to side step some of these issues by taking them to Luci's for dessert and coffee.   Between the three of us we ordered three 12 ounce coffees, one cinnamon roll and two pieces of an apple tart. Total bill? $23 bucks... Ah well, I thought, you pay for quality.   right?   No. The cinnamon roll looked and tasted exactly like the deadly square things you can get at any convenience store. Even heated the frosting didn't loosen up, rather it kept its glue like consistency.   The apple tart looked magnificent, however the flavor was severely lacking. The taste was like a fleeting thought of apple, as if I was remembering a good slice of pie.   The coffee was simply OK, nothing great.   I love the open feel to Luci's, and the patio area is great. The lunch menu has some very interesting options that I will come back to try.   As I gazed longingly at the Starbucks across the street I realized that maybe, just maybe, my parents were on to something. If you don't try new things you probably won't be disappointed.",

I've brought out of town guests to lucis because it has been one of my favorite places. Today, I was thoroughly disappointed. Ordered 2 iced vanilla lattes, a bagel, and oatmeal. Lattes came out as regular lattes. No big deal, added vanilla syrup and the almond milk one was WAY too sweet. Again, no big deal. Honest mistake and the barista remade the latte. Bagel came out, great! After 30 minutes the oatmeal was still not ready. I went to check on it and asked why it was taking so long. I received a sarcastic response that they were still working on it. I'm sorry, but I know it doesn't take 30 minutes to make oatmeal. When the oatmeal was finally brought out it was just set down on the table and the server walked away. No, \"I'm sorry.\" Nothing.  The oatmeal was still raw and crunchy. It honestly wasn't edible. At this point we left. I'm disappointed. The gentleman who brought the oatmeal used to be my very favorite barista! :(  Maybe it was just an off day. Not sure. But I won't be going back anytime soon",

While their ordering system is not what I'd choose it to be, the service and food more than make up for it.   --------------------------------  Decent food. I had the Greek omelette. The other diner have the sunrise with a side order of a bagel and cream cheese but did not arrive till we asked for it a third time at the end of the meal.  Very long and somewhat confusing ordering system. Sales prevention on additional items since you'd have to go all the way back to the other side of the place and get back in line. Thus I did not get one of their wonderful looking cinnamon rolls, but found it easier to get into my car and drive to sprouts for a piece a cake.",

Full menu of food that's made fresh . All the bakery items and food are made  fresh  rite there on the premisis. Also theirs the grocery store rite there with a good assortment of produce and any thing eles you might need. Many afternoons myself and a dear friend would get our coffee and some thing to eat and read British news papers.  We would spend some times 2 to 3 hours drinking coffee and reading the various London and UK news papers. We both enjoyed the English as it tends to be significantly different from American English. My friend was not able to read the papers on his own because he had retinitis pigmentosa. Which is a degenerative eye disease that he was born with. Luci's was a really nice place to sit and enjoy a good chat and drink. On many occasions other friends of ours would turn up and join us. And at times we would cross the street and go to Starbucks. If Luci's  was packed with people. Luci'shas tables outside that are covered with awwnings or you can sit inside and if the weather is pleasant which it is from septemper to April they will have the sliding doors all open; so your seated inside but you have the light of day and fresh air. It's really nice. This place gets busy especially on the weekend. They have a great selection of house made drinks and a whole assortment of   popular healthy  beverages as well as snacks they also carry wine and champagne. Another thing I love about Luci's they are health directed I mean they sell and carry organic ( not exclusively) and brands geared towards good health and the other great thing is they have a full kitchen and bakery. They do not have to have the bakery items brought in from a big off site bakery. So if the run out of say a cinnamon roll or a muffin you happen to like;  theirs a good chance that they have more just being freshly baked. Comfortable, welcoming atmosphere. Couples,  singles small groups. It's a really nice place for everyone. They've got 2 Loos. No need to stay at home feeling lonely and blue. Head on out to Luci\"s and have a healthy beverages and enjoy the company of lots of other folks.  It's nice that Phoenix has many places similar to Luci's. We need these type of cafes here in Portland/ Vancouver.",

    "text": "How to lose a devoted local business supporter to Starbucks: So, here's my story. I go to Luci's first thing in the morning, just before 7am. I'm the only person in line. It's broad daylight but they have these lights on overhead, and they need replacement, so two of them are blinking. Constantly. The thing about strobing lights is, if you have a disability, like I do, blinking lights can cause serious problems. Like seizures and ocular migraines. That's why theatres and concert venues have to put signs out warning people when they use them. So, I tell the barista that the lights are blinking and that they can cause seizures and that I need him to turn them off. He says, \"okay!\" And then proceeds to do... nothing. I wait. He didn't call a manager. Didn't take my order or ask how he could make me more comfortable or express concern. He *did* fix three more drinks while I stood there in obvious discomfort and he didn't do anything to serve me. And then I left. And went to the Starbucks across the street.  Then I emailed Luci's and told them what happened. And just like that effing barista, they did... nothing. Didn't respond. No \"I'm so sorry, we fixed the lights and spoke with the barista.\" No \"Here's a coupon for your next drink, please come back, sorry we completely disregarded your disability.\" Just... ignored me.  Then I emailed them again and expressed dismay that they absolutely ignored me. And they ignored *that.*  And that, my friends, is how you lose a devoted local-business-only shopper... to Starbucks. Never going to Luci's again, because they suck.",

So FYI not only is their coffee to die for, you'll want to buy all of your girlfriends gifts while you're there!   The only thing, if you're a weirdo like me, is depending on the temperature you prefer your coffee you may need to order extra hot. The normal temp they seem make their drinks at is more on my definition of warm when I prefer hot.  Cheers and I can't wait to visit wiry enough time to order food!",

Served with tater tots.  Sounds yummy? NOT... it was dry, lacked any flavor, the bun overcooked and tater tots dried out. We went at 7pm, one would have thought they were sitting on the stovetop all day. The person that served us ignored us after we were served, it was visually obvious everything was overcooked. I should have returned the food but my attitude anymore is to not sent it back, lest someone spit in my food. Should have went to Smashburger...a much better burger all around.",

The serve up a decent cup of coffee and their treats from the coffee bar so add another star.  I haven't had anything else on their menu but everything looks good so watch this space for another star.  I'm less than impressed by the actual market part. Their shelves are stocked but I can never see myself coming here for groceries. Minus a star  :(  All that said, I was desperate on the Friday before Christmas as I needed fresh basil. I managed to score the last package at Sprouts but I then proceed to dash all over the Biltmore area in search for the second package. No luck at Safeway, Fry's or Basha's. On a whim I popped into Luci's and scored the fresher looking of two packages of basil that looked sadly beyond their shelf lives. At this point though, I had no choice.  The young guy who rang me up noticed the sorry state of my basil and after determining the poor quality of the other package proceeded to go into the store room and return with another package of FRESH fresh basil. OUTSTANDING service and attention to detail that would have been overlooked anywhere else. ADD 2 STARS for being exceptional!  I still don't think that all of my grocery needs will be met here and I don't think that that is their goal. But I appreciate exceptional service like I received here so I plan to purchase what I can here. If nothing else, it's a perfect time to go back and sample their menu.  Well done Luci's!",

NOW: with their leaning towards healthy goods and good for you foods, there were NO vegan options in pastries. strange..but lots of gluten free, GF does not make a vegan happy. Perhaps consult with a vegan?   My latte was great, almond milk vanilla latte. love that they have these options!   I was SHOCKED and amazed to look at their dinner menu and see that they served veal. As we all know, Veal is baby cows taken from their mothers at birth and locked in a box for 6-10 weeks and then slaughtered. This is promoting animal violence and cruelty and I cannot support a business that does this.  I think Luci's is confused about their identity, here is healthy food (some of the best brands are here in their store) and then there is VEAL, no they don't cancel each other out and you can't make everyone happy Luci's. Pick an identity and go with it. Until I hear differently about the cruelty you choose to condone, you have lost my support.",

Starbucks is for caffeine on a work day while Luci's is something else entirely.   I'm from a very small town (3,500 people). In a small town every place you eat, drink, shop, or otherwise patronize places you alongside people from the community. To me, Luci's basically embodies the same kind of local, community based feeling but in a very large and widespread city. It is a place that has to be discovered because there is a Starbucks across the intersection that provides the uninitiated a safe option that keeps them in their comfort zone.   The staff are simply great, offering up friendliness along with the coffee and food. They have the best french toast that I've had maybe ever. I'm a frequent flyer on the bagel and lox airline. The only thing I would add there is to please, please, please start slicing the onions thinner for the bagels/lox.   I've bought some things from the grocery store, but it isn't my usual reason for going. They have unusual items that might be difficult to find elsewhere. I feel like Luci's is a throwback and I mean that in the best possible way. Give Luci's a shot, I think you'll like it.",

The two last visits were disappointing -- long, slow lines, barely anywhere to sit, and the food was just okay. My breakfast \"sammie\" was cold but had a nice flavor from the bacon. It comes with no sides. I overheard a manager explaining to a patron the somewhat complicated ordering system as \"fast casual.\" I'm not sure about the fast part - if by \"casual\" we mean \"disorganized\" then I'll vouch for that. They deliver your food to you but you have to get your beverage yourself. After I stood around in the crowded area around the coffee bar for ten minutes and got my latte, I returned to my seat to find someone else in it, even though my plate had been dropped off. I relocated to the chef bar by the kitchen to eat my lukewarm sandwich in peace -- only to be bugged by a family asking to have my seat since everything else was occupied. I would have liked to get a water, but there was no one to ask and I didn't feel like going back in the long line. It's just too much money for the hassle and miserable experience. It's also unfortunate that all the fun little shops that used to give the plaza its character are gone. It could be any blase strip mall in Phoenix now. I'll look elsewhere.",

Then what the hell do they have the second counter for then?! To go orders are a pain here and completely unpredictable since you walk in and sometimes there's a person at the second counter taking your to go order and sometimes you need to wait in the main line for the order. It is not efficient and the food is so so, and not worth the pain in the ass to order and lines can get long during rushes. They also do not provide any condiments for to go orders such as ketchup, hot sauce, Tabasco, nothing! Unless you ask for it... The food is ok here but if you are ordering to go I would not suggest coming here until they provide a more time efficient way to get your food.",

I absolutely recommend a drop in if you're ever in the area. The produce used in their food is super fresh and high quality too. My breakfast burrito this morning has types of potatoes I didn't even know existed in it.",

Prospective customers came in TWO NIGHTS in a row asking for coffee - around 8:30 the first night and 8:45 the second- and they were told that the registers had been shut down and that they could not purchase anything.   Too bad- the owner is a class guy. However, unless he corrects this people will not come due to the tight parking and flippant employees.",

I got the burger. I felt it was overpriced and not much flavor but the quantity of food is legit. The coffee is good and that was the bright spot. I would probably run in for a coffee from time to time, but I wouldn't stay. The staff was friendly, but I just wanted to get out of there.

Have you ever eaten a 'non toasted' English muffin? Eew! Thankfully I got it to go and am currently in the process of toasting at home :(. Also, it was supposed to be scrambled eggs and it's not. It is just an omelet folded onto itself. I don't like omelets, that's why I ordered an egg sandwich!   Sorry Luci but you can never quite hit the mark in my eyes. Boo!",

It's a popular spot. I find the coffee disappointing, but I'm no expert, so others may disagree. My complaint is that air conditioning either doesn't work effectively for the space or simply is not set to a comfortable level. This has been a problem since Luci's opened. My friends & I often wind up leaving sooner than we'd like because place is just too hot. In summer, I'm hesitant to meet people there because I know how uncomfortable it will be. It's a shame & I can't help but wonder what the problem is. Luci's is unique & deserving of more stars, please...fix the a/c!!",

The hot coffee and cold brew tastes like a standard diner cup of coffee, which is perfectly palatable, but nothing to look forward to. Their breakfast food is satisfactory, but leaves very little to be memorable. Additionally, on multiple occasions there have been pieces of meat in their medley potatoes. As a self-proclaimed healthy marketplace, I would expect their cooks to be more aware of cross contamination of ingredients, especially since they accommodate many vegetarians and vegans.

In addition to the food, the market is super fun! They have wines, freezer items and lots of fun little trinkets. Perusing the market makes any wait for your food fly by.  I personally would recommend getting a bagel with lox, the funky monkey French toast or any Sammie! I don't think any menu item would be a bad choice.  My only complaint is how pricey it is. We rarely can eat here for under $30 for two of us, with gluten free adding $1-$2 per item.",

I usually go for breakfast and the acai bowls are the best. It comes out in a small bowl but it's quite deep and you get a lot of food with it. The menu ranges from breakfast to lunch sandwiches and offers a lot of choice. I've had the crabby omelette and I was so surprised. It had a good amount of salmon and crab in it which made it super yummy. The eggs were also very fluffy and again the portions were on the larger side so you get the bang for your buck!    They also have a ton of wine to choose from as well as little gifts/trinkets/candles you'd find at urban outfitters if that's your cup of tea.   Overall I love the vibe of this place and would recommend :)",

There was no line to pay so I was hopeful to be in & out in a couple of minutes. Instead, the cashier was extremely distracted and asked me the same questions twice, she was not even close to listening. It took 20 minutes to put the coffee in a cup, and that was after standing at the pickup counter and asking for it several times. No apologies for the delay whatsoever. I will not be returning and will be deterring others from giving them business.",

    "text": "The reason for my two-star review has nothing to do with the food/coffee, it is purely based on the service. I have never eaten at Luci's (though I want to try it!), but their coffee is very good. I love the iced lattes with almond :)   However, the last two times I went, the service wasn't good at all. Last weekend, my sister and I went and ordered separately. After waiting a few minutes, hers was ready so we sat at a table to wait for mine. After about 15 minutes of waiting (we got distracted talking and didn't realize how long it'd been at first lol), it was obvious they'd just forgotten about it. So then I just reminded them and they apologized and quickly made it for me, but it just wasn't that busy, so I feel like it shouldn't have been forgotten.   Then, this morning we went back and I ordered two large iced lattes. When I got to the front of the line, the girl who took my order was joking around with the other cashier. That would have been totally fine, but she took a little longer to address me when I came up because she was talking to him. Then, after she was done talking and asked what I wanted, he replied and she started laughing - this also would have been fine, except she was laughing and clearly not paying attention to what I said so I had to repeat my order twice. Then after that, I had to repeat myself two more times because she still wasn't paying attention. Finally, she got everything going and I paid. When my drinks were done and they called my name, I came up to see she made the wrong size for both of them... it was just frustrating that she wasn't paying attention at all and got the order wrong after I literally told her four times.   Not that I would call her out on Yelp, but I'm pretty sure it was the same girl both times, too. I definitely hope the service improves next time I'm there!",

    "text": "I ate at Luci's this evening, going with a small group that included my wife.  Someone else in the group suggested it and we went along with the suggestion because we were looking for someplace close and fast.  When we got to Luci's my wife said, \"You know, I'm not going to get anything to eat.  The last time I ate here it wasn't very good.\"  I went ahead with ordering a sandwich and a drink.  Of the 7 people in the group only 3 of us got something to eat.  Even the person who made the suggestion didn't order anything to eat.  Ummm...  Well, my sandwich (the Dirty Doctor Melt) was not very good.  The bread was dry and STALE.  It had turkey, roast beef, cheddar cheese and avocado. From the menu I thought it was going to be a hot / warm sandwich (the cheese was advertised to be melted).  Well, it was room temperature and yes, the cheese had been melted but had cooled off and didn't blend in with the meat.  The roast beef was thickly carved with the grain vs. across the grain so it was tougher than it should be.  The turkey was fine as was the cheddar and avocado, but it didn't combine together into a tasty sandwich.  Might as well as just put those items on a plate to serve them separately.  I was disappointed. And then I remembered eating at Luci's on a previous occasion - at least two years ago.  And it all came back, I had a similar experience that time.  The food just isn't that good.  If a restaurant is going to serve sandwiches, at the very least the bread should be good / fresh.  Perhaps my wife and I have just had bad luck with this restaurant but her memory of her previous experience proved to be True for my experience tonight.  The service is good and the people are friendly.  That is why it got two stars vs. one.",

    "text": "On my way to lunch in the same plaza, I spotted Luci's - a place I'd been hearing about lately.  I decided I would stop in after lunch, and did just that.  What a cute place!  I love the decor and love that there seem to be lots of treasures to be found in the market area.  Since I didn't do more than take a cursory glance as I walked in, this review will be for the coffeeshop/bakery only.  First... the good.  1. The two women behind the counter were both very friendly and helpful, which counts for a lot at any place I visit.  2. The display case of baked good was stocked with lots of really beautiful pastries.  I found myself wanting a small bite of everything!  3. Even though it wasn't on the menu, I was able to order a cafe au lait - my current obsession.  4. Seating was plentiful and comfortable.  And the not-so-good...  1. The strawberry cupcake, while beautiful and dusted with really pretty edible shimmer of some sort, was dry, crumbly, and not very good.  The icing tasted great but left a very strange film in my mouth - sort of waxy, oily, greasy consistency.  2. I've been advised that it is not out of the norm for a coffeeshop to hand you your cup of heated milk/foam/etc. for you to fill on your own with coffee from carafes (not so with espresso-based drinks), but I'm really bothered by this practice for some reason.  Luci's is the second place in Phoenix I've visited who does this.  Maybe I'm just being fussy about it, but I think if I'm going to pay $4 for some steamed milk and coffee, the least you can do is top it off with coffee for me.  3. When I'm paying $4 to pour my own coffee, I expect the last 1/4 of the cup will not be filled with coffee grounds.  This happened to me today (not until I got back to the office, of course) and I was very displeased about it.  Luci's is a nice little place, the employees are very friendly, and the coffee (sans grounds) was actually pretty good.  I can see it being a nice place to read, people-watch, or even do some work, so it does have a lot going for it.  I'm not sure I'll ever go out of my way to visit, but if I'm in the area and it comes down to choosing Luci's over Starbucks (which is just across the street), Luci's will win any day.",

However, I decided to give it a try for lunch one day.  What can I say?  I LOVE THIS PLACE! Granted there is absolutely nothing special about the atmosphere and the patrons were not quite as eclectic as I thought they would be (OK I used to hang out in Greenwich Village a lot when I lived in NY).  But the \"something special\" is right where it counts... The wonderful food and friendly staff.  If you are looking for unbelievably great tasting, organic, fresh and healthy food; this is the place to go.  My first time there I had the Humm-Dinger Vegan Wrap. This wrap had artichokes, zucchini, red bell peppers (all roasted to perfection), fresh and I mean FRESH spinach along with hummus and balsamic. For my side I had the homemade asiago penne salad and an herbal iced tea to drink.  The wrap was by far the best tasting wrap I have ever had anywhere! The penne salad was very good and it was a nice small portion (just the right size).  The herbal iced tea was absolutely full of flavor and the portion size on the wrap was great. If I were hungrier I could have consumed the whole wrap, but as it were I took half of it home and enjoyed it just as much the next day.  Yes, I really do love this place.  I have now been back for a third time and I have never been disappointed. The other dishes I have tried are: The Portobello \"Shroom\" Burger (absolutely fantastic!) and the Low Carb Gobbler Wrap (again another fresh and delicious choice).  I now look forward to going here much more often for lunch and I want to try their breakfast too.  Something tells me I won't be disappointed.",

The only problem is it's pretty pricey so my trips there are reserved to when I'm feeling a little wealthy, but I still can appreciate a good breakfast place, no matter the price.",

    "text": "This place is right next to my house. I used to go a lot more often but i have realized they are the most expensive coffee in the area for the least tasty coffee. The baristas this don't make great coffee but they are really nice! It's a great place to sit and get some work done. They offer food which is reasonably priced. However, it is inconsistent - sometimes delicious but sometimes really bad. I like the \"dirty doctor\" melt and have learned not to experiment (don't get the lavash pizza!!!). They also have very hip groceries (for the organic soccer mom). Honestly i like the place but i usually go to the starbucks across the street now because the coffee is both better and less expensive. I hope they read this and dramatically improve their coffee!!! I will happily come back!!! Until then there are too many good options nearby (lola, lux, copperstar, shine, and even- gasp- sbucks).",

    "text": "Repeat dessert visit last weekend. I brought a group with me this time so we could try a bit more.  This Time:  Carrot Cake: Moist, earthy, amazing delicious cream cheese frosting and not overly sweet. Very good and up there with the better ones I've had in phoenix.  Super Double Triple Chocolate Crazy Delicious Brownie Cupcake: Sadly I don't remember the actual name of this but it was very good. They had another variation with walnuts but another member of the party had an allergy so we opted for this version. Death by chocolate for sure. One of those treats you can feel spike your insulin as soon as it hits your mouth. Splurges like this are what make life worth living. Don't deprive yourself of this type of thing just behave the rest of the time :)  Giant Cinnamon Bun: This was a cinnabun on steroids, over twice the size and I think much better. Had a nice glob of icing in the center. The girl behind the counter insisted that she get to warn it up for me. She used some ridiculously cute phrase to describe how much more amazing it made it. In fact both times I've been in there she has cracked me up. Ah cute coffee girls.. you make my days a little better.",

Each visit the food was fantastic,the staff warm,courteous and attentive. We have eaten everything from omelets,burgers,smoothies (smoothies are 1/2 price after 5pm) and salads and more,all great. I made one suggestion to the manager on duty (Alfred) and he couldn't say enough how they appreciated constructive criticism,and would act on my suggestion.. The overall feel of Luci's is just a very welcoming place.They have jazz on sat evenings,looking forward to trying that soon I think a lot of the negative reviews are bogus from other competitors All the best, Mark and Allison W",

    "text": "11/3/2016  Yelp review Luci's Healthy Marketplace 1590 E. Bethany Home Rd. Phoenix, Arizona 85014 ~9.8 mi (602)-773-1339  I have lived in Arizona for all my existence and I have not found a breakfast joint I have loved, until I stumbled upon Luci's Healthy Market Place. I may be bias but they have the best pancakes I have even had. Growing up my parents always took me to IHop and Denny's but I always felt like I wasn't doing my body any good. Most breakfast joints only have dishes that are super unhealthy and too sweet to be consumed in the morning. Luci's is an amazing place to lay back and relax. My go to dish is the \"Big Boy Breakfast\" it's amazing and I recommended it to any \"first timers\". It doesn't take too artificial or over processed and you feel satisfied afterwards. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and Luci's is the place to start the day.  When you first walk into Luci's, one might be overwhelmed because there is an actual market within the restaurant. The market has many organic goods that are unique and you wouldn't be able to find at any Wal-Mart. When I go, I always find myself looking at the knick-knacks that are so cute and tempting to buy. The aesthetic of Luci's is very sweet. It has a very retro vibe yet very rustic. The actual restaurant is very small, sometimes I must admit, it gets really tight and overwhelming. You wait in line to order and wait for the server to serve your food. The wait is very short, even when there is many people ordering food. It's kid friendly and accommodating for many people in a hurry.   One time, my mom and I ordered a Green Tea smoothie and as we stepped outside to enjoy the day, I, of course, dropped my smoothie and go it all over my shoes and the pavement. I went in side to get some napkins to clean my shoes. I wasn't going to ask for a new drink because I was too embarrassed, but a server saw what happened from a far and ordered me a drink without even asking. Once I was done cleaning myself up, I saw a server coming towards me with a new Green tea smoothie. When she handed it to me, I was so happy and grateful. I tried to tip her, but she didn't let me. I expressed my gratitude, and left. With that being said, the service at Luci's is amazing! They always go the extra mile and they really made my day a whole lot better. Service really makes a difference and I recommend this place to anyone and everyone.   The server, Amanda, that replaced my drink was amazing and I always look for her whenever I visit Luci's. When I think of making good eating habits, I think of Luci's. Their potions aren't outrages and are satisfying. This local joint is very popular in my part of town and you can always expect an amazing time when you go. I give Luci's Healthy Market Place, 5 out of 5 stars for amazing everything! Please try this place, its amazing and healthy! Replace IHop with Luci's and it will change your life!",

There was a Spanish speaking person next to me and the cashier automatically assumed that my group was with her, she skipped to the next person in line. The cashier attending to the Spanish speaker was to the left of me and the cashier lady was tending to the right of me. She saw me and my group in the middle of the register line awkwardly standing there and didn't ask to help. So finally, the left cashier was done we were able to order. Placed our order, cashier couldn't figure out to split the bill. Had to wait longer. We sat down, and waited drinks never came. I asked the lady, where are our drinks while she was serving our food. She responded with I will make them right now. We ate, and finished our food. Never got our drinks. Asked for my refund, was not offered anything in return. I usually really like this place, like a lot. I have spent a great deal of money here. Just the overall service has gone down.",

Parking not so accommodating but this center never has been and it's worth dealing with for the food, atmosphere and COFFEE!!   I had the big boy breakfast and it was real good. The bacon was crisp but not burnt and the scrambled eggs were omelet style folded over which was a nice presentation.  Now the real kicker is that I love an ORANGE MOCHA, they actually had the orange syrup and made it so tasty. First place in Phoenix I've found, and honestly not sure I'll go looking for another.   All the staff is friendly and talkative and they have a killer little market with fun gifts, and god healthy snacks, cheese, wine, gluten free selections, etc.    Check it out!",

They also have a marketplace offering health food, organics, wine, local items and kitschy items. Come in a few times and they'll remember your name and drink. The baristas are friendly and FAST. In the rush hours it can be jammed full but you can still grab your coffee, breakfast sandwich, and a fresh salad for lunch in under ten minutes. A fun place to hang out for lunch or breakfast.   They are pricier than Circle K (obviously) but less than Starbucks with a much more pleasant environment. The parking is minimal directly in front of the shop so it can be a tight squeeze during heavy business hours.",

I love the cool hippie style vibe of the place. It's mix between whole foods, trader joes, and Starbucks.   I had the gluten free funky monkey French toast with a side of sausage and eggs...all sooooo yummy omg !   Hubby had the turkey burger with a side of dill potato salad and a fruit smoothie which was beyond delicious. The burger was super moist and delicious. It was topped with artichoke and roasted red pepper which gave it so much flavor. He wasn't a fan of the potato salad. Great healthy good in a cute cozy spot.   My only gripe is the price. Spent $40+ on brunch yikes.",

The place is confusing at first with SO much to look at. I didn't really know what I was doing, so I ended up following where everyone else was going and alas! I see a menu and a counter.  I was approached by a lovely girl name leigha (?) She was very sweet and welcoming with a beautiful smile. A couple jokes were cracked by her which got the short line behind me laughing. I honestly haven't seen customer service like this in awhile. She helped me out with the ordering and what to do because again, I was just so clueless. She was just all around wonderful!   I ordered the french toast with some fruit on top because it was very much recommended. I also got a my usual honey almond milk latte ( I get it at every coffee shop I come across). The barista did a great job. I'm bummed I didn't grab her name! But err, she was tall with dark hair and glasses. She did great.  I went in on a Sunday so it was very busy. Anyway, this place is absolutely wonderful and will definitely be bringing my family here next week when they visit me from back home in Montana!",

Tough to prepare that expansive feast in an unknown kitchen with unknown tools.  We didn't want our Thanksgiving dinner at a sit-down restaurant since we had rented a nice place on the border of South Mountain Park.  We opted instead for Luci's carry-out Thanksgiving meal with a bit of trepidation.  Was it going to be good... were they going to remember the cranberry relish... was the Fall salad going to be comprised of wilted lettuce?  We were a group of five and we unanimously each gave it five stars.  Not quite the same when you are cooking it yourself but as close as we thought you could get.  We picked up two large boxes on Thanksgiving day at 11am and with minimal prep had the meal on the table after a nice hike at 4pm.  They provided clear directions for the final finishes and it turned out great.  It met and beat our expectations by a wide margin.  Staff on the phone when we ordered and staff at Luci's when we arrived had us in and out in a matter of minutes with smiles and well wishes.  That Fall salad... no wilted lettuce to be seen but only fresh goodness!  Well done, folks!",

I was told they have tons of stuff that was gluten free not only in the market, but also in their food section. And they do!  Marketplace. Now, I honestly think that they are pretty overpriced for some of their gluten-free stuff, but they do offer some varieties I haven't seen at a traditional place like Whole Foods or Sprouts - AND this place is super cute too. It's a pretty small marketplace compared to a grocery store, but when you shop here you can get an awesome meal and cup of coffee.   Eatery. This is my favorite part of Luci's. You can order food or coffee at the Coffee Bar sign. They have tons of stuff - again, the omelets are my favorite - and plenty of treats. Endless choices for coffee too. PS they offer GLUTEN-FREE BREAD. Oh yum yum yum!  Also, be sure to check out their website and sign up for cooking classes. They're a bit pricey - $39.99 a piece, but they sound super interesting. I had to cancel the ones I had recently because of a timing issue, but they sound SO good!   Why not 5 stars? Well, the parking. I HATE the parking! It's in the weirdest L-shaped shopping center and I had to double-back a few times in order to secure a spot.",

I guess my only complaint is that it's everyone else's favorite too! LOL! It's frequently packed and the parking stinks. It's tough to get in and out quickly for just a coffee. They tend to get backed up in the kitchen too when it comes to food. We've waiting a long time for food eating in and for take out.

So, even though there are some small \"imperfections\", Luci's is a definite 5-star place.  I LOVE THEM.  I am seriously considering setting up a cot in the store... then I could wake up and have the most delicious coffee (mocha, always) and fabulous service without going to the effort of leaving my house.  Hmm... think they'd let me?    Luci's has quickly become my most favorite neighborhood spot.  It is obviously helpful that it is super-close to my house... but there are plenty of other coffee places within a reasonable distance and no one comes close.  The entire concept is just genius - breakfast, lunch, dinner, bakery, cooking classes, cleaning products (all natural, of course), homeopathic remedies, locally sourced produce - my list could go on and on...   My most favorite thing about Luci's - their service.  I can't even begin to describe how awesome their baristas and chefs are - everyone is so sociable and friendly. Who wouldn't like to come here?  Not only are they good at making drinks and food - but they'll even recommend some good music for you to add to your itunes collection.  Love it!  Of course, their food/drinks are pretty awesome too - I adore the mochas - Iced, hot, peppermint, whatever-  it is always good.  The pomegranate citrus iced tea is so refreshing. I think I might be addicted.  Other top-notch items include muffins (blueberry and double chocolate-chip, especially), pasta bar, the Naughty Nurse and Dirty Doctor sandwich melts (and the names just make it more fun!), and the freakin' fabulous soup we had the other night... some kind of African spices?  Lentils, beef... amazing stuff.   We've also loved their burger, omelets, creme-brulee cupcake, etc.  They always have a number of gluten-free options, and they are constantly adding new ones - THANK YOU!  The imperfections (still not phasing me - because I LOVE them) - wait time for meals can be pretty long, which isn't a big deal if I'm staying and chatting, but occasionally I'm just ordering food to take home and don't have enough time to wait and wait.  Didn't love the peach-oatmeal muffin... meh.  See? Minor issues.  Nothing we can't get past, and still live happily ever after.",

The naughty nurse sandwich was very tasty, the hubby had a breakfast burrito which was decent and our 5 yr old had the kids pancakes with fruit which were outstanding. Don't order the Tator tots as they are nothing special but the side of pasta salad was very nice with good flavor includes asparagus, peppers and tomatoes. They have fun different flavored sodas and lemonade as well as a coffee bar and don't forget the $3 Mimosas. Everything else though seems a bit pricey. We had a great meal and will be back.",

Jaek and I recently hung out at a table in the open garage-door, inside patio type area of Luci's, and we both had a great time. (see photos)  A big reason for this was the friendly and helpful demeanor of Braden, a barista/juicista/pastryista behind the counter. After eyeballing a red velvet cake slice with cream cheese frosting dolloped up on top that actually had *GLITTER* covering it, I asked how they made edible glitter, or if those were just for show. He explained about pulverized polished sugar, and after I shared that I have a bonified, legit case of picaphobia (glitter - it's little tiny sharp edged peices of metal or hard plastic, you know, with a mind of it's own, an inability to wash off, a tendency to get men in trouble for indiscretions at the boobiebar, and a seeming ability to reproduce.  I think it may be alive and evil, actually), and that I was taking a huge psychological step in overcoming it by having decided that I was going to get one of those slices and actually eat my psyche's penultimate nemesis, he congratulated me and said that it was on him.    Well, since he comped that glittercake, I felt allright splurging for a tasty, but still overpriced, big glass of fresh squeezed OJ.  I tried, but couldn't find a single expired meat or cheese item in the fridge case.  I still say it's a weird conglomeration, and a bit pricey, but if I was a local without a car, being able to walk here every couple days would be wonderful.  Oh yeah, the fine folks at Luci's have put up a nice plaque thanking the local firefighters who saved their place from destruction during Richardson's recent burn.",

We only got lattes, and then snooped around the marketplace so I can't vouch for the food...yet.  I am so glad I read Amber W's review or I would have never known about the elusive Soy Coconut Latte. It's not apparent right away what flavors you can have in your latte so I asked and eagerly awaited my coconut delight. My girlfriend got a vanilla latte which she said was good, then she tried my coconut latte. Holy hell, I haven't seen her express so much delight or get that look on her face in awhile(sad right?). I agreed and spent the next 20 min slowly savoring every last drop.   I love the cups, the material and design keep in the heat and it doesn't require a sleeve - plus it just looks cool. We browsed around the store a bit, everything is impeccably organized, tidy and clean. They have some good stuff that we regularly include on our weekly shopping list, albeit most of it was at a higher price. They carry some local items(Simply Bread, Salem's hummus and pitas, etc) that are hard to find anywhere else, although again they are slightly higher in price.   I love the open air concept, the people all seemed great. I see people complaining about the parking, maybe some days it is a problem but really people need to get over the typical Phoenix strip mall:  HUGE massive parking lot out front with stores set far back off the street. It ruins the aesthetics and appeal of the store front and isn't as inviting. I will be biking and/or walking here soon(as others should try to do as well) so parking becomes a mute point. If you really have issues with the parking park in the huge abandoned parking lot west of 16th st and walk a couple hundred yards - problem solved.  I didn't see too many vegan items, lots of gluten free stuff but no bakery items or section marked as vegan. I also didn't see much on the menu that was vegan either. I was secretly hoping that since it was called \"Healthy\" Marketplace it would have more(hasn't anyone read The China Study\" ?). A few more vegan grocery and menu items and this place would easily be a 5 in my book; this area is desperately in need of it.  I am not sure which direction Luci's will head, the marketplace is a nice idea, but I am not sure I could see myself buying much in the way of staple items. I could see this place maybe expanding on the cafe and seating and maybe going towards more of the specialty market(read things you CAN'T find anyplace else). I am excited to see where Luci's ends up in the future, I will definitely be back for the coconut lattes and hopefully to try some menu items(I can give you some great vegan ideas - I need a breakfast/brunch spot with options!)",

    "text": "Went with the family for the first time to Luci's.  Had been looking forward to it for quite some time.  Loved the atmosphere!  We were able to get a table easily, even with it being Sunday breakfast.  The staff was quick and efficient and very cheery.  My kids had the pancakes and French toast which we all enjoyed!  husband had the huevos rancheros which he liked.  I had the breakfast Sammie which was good.  The quality of the meats was excellent - my sandwich had turkey sausage and we ordered a side of bacon.  My favorites were the kids' dishes and our coffees.  The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the cost.  Holy moly!  For what we ordered, we paid $65 plus tip!  When I looked at the bill, it was because everything added up - the cashier kept asking if we wanted to add berries and bananas to our kids' meals and it turns out that each different fruit was $1.  Excessive if you ask me.  I would think adding on fruit would be just one price or she would at least warn me that we would be spending an extra $3 for blueberries, strawberries and bananas.  For the cost of the meals, you would think they came with fruit anyway!   Overall we enjoyed the food and experience.  I feel like it's rare to get great service in this city sometimes and I don't think that's a problem here.  The staff is great!  We'll be back, especially to bring out-of-town guests who are vegan and gluten intolerant, but we'll just able a little more choosy with our add-ons.",

Upon first glance at the menu it's pretty obvious that most of it isn't healthy what so ever.  Where are the fresh salads?  How about some quinoa or beets?  Whole wheat pasta?   How about something made with fresh, local ingredients?  I tried a veggie wrap of some kind and it was ok.  Not memorable at all.  And everything is prepared in this tiny 'kitchen'.  It looks more like a demo kitchen!  How can you truly create amazing food if you have no space to do it? All in all, Luci's is a big disappointment in my book.",

A lot of the products support helping the environment, but most items are not edible. It definitely has a cool selection of items.  As for the food, I love the menu and offerings of things to drink and eat. Most of the menu items are breakfast related and in a weird turn of fate, I wasn't feeling like breakfast food, so I opted for a sandwich.  Which might have been my mistake. It was not a sandwich I normally would have ordered and I was trying to be more health orientated. But I was not wild about the sandwich, totally my mistake, not Luci's. Next time I'll know better and stick to breakfast food.  As for the breakfast options, friends that were with me ordered the kids pancakes and they were HUGE!

Unique and cute gift shop where things are a bit on the pricier end but saying that I would pay for them bc they're so cute. But also things you could most likely find at TJMAXX. I'm mostly upset about the coffee. I ordered a mocha and it tasted like warm milk and 50 cent hot cocoa mix. I debated on taking it back, but I did because if I'm going to pay for something it should taste better than that. So they made me a latte. Which I was grateful for. It didn't taste good but at least I could taste the espresso. I have type 1 diabetes and don't usually get to enjoy mochas or any sugary drinks. I was treating myself and wanted to stop by and try some things out because I was taking a break from my extremely strict diet. So. Super sad about it. Will not ever go back again. If anyone wants good coffee they should go to Elevate Coffee Company. I tried it on my week off and splurged and got a blueberry muffin from there as well and it was the best decision I made ever. I got a mocha with half sweetness. Highly recommend that place. I don't work for them or have any affiliation. I just found that gem on my way to Sedona! :)",

I usually don't go for sandwiches but I decided to try the naughty nurse and I enjoyed it! Everything on it tasted fresh and I liked the multigrain bread. I chose  berries as my side and some of them liked a tad funky, but mostly good. I also got a snickerdoodle cookie which was the star of the show. When I ordered it I couldn't tell if it was going to be hard or soft, but I got lucky and it was a delicious soft cookie, I thought it was excellent. I hope to come back to try the black bean burger!",

    "text": "Best Thanksgiving meal ever.  I couldn't find any reviews on their Thanksgiving meals so I hope this helps someone else considering this.   I was so nervous that it wouldn't be good and then would be stuck with nothing boy was I wrong.  This is the first time I have ordered to go dinner for a holiday and is now my tradition.  We did the complete meal and everything was great.  Unlike many places the meal they offer had some choices you can sub out sides for salads. I did this and the fall salad was great.  I really liked that they didn't have green bean casserole but rather roasted veggies.  Everything was so good.  It was a little pricer than some stores at $159 but for me it was worth it since I was able to make sure the sides were what I wanted.    The only negative I can say is that the roles we had did have some mold, but maybe I was supposed to refrigerate????  The turkey was amazing not as big as I thought but we fed 4 and could have fed 8 easy.  There are so much sides, likes pounds of them.  Awesome because leftovers are the best.    Over all I give it a thumbs up and will continue to order.  I was able to spend the whole day with my family rather than cooking and cleaning.  Thank you Luci's you made our Thanksgiving something special.",

A couple tablespoons of granola in a silly flat bottom wood bowl served with some silly big wood cooking spoon.   It was by far the worst acai bowl I've ever had in every way.

I get the Chai tea latte, and its delicious. They also have fresh pastries to go along with your meal or drink.   It's local places like this that gives a community its own flavor.

I like the coffee, it's a nice light roast and it's organic. Most of the omelettes and breakfast dishes are a little pricey for me as a daily routine, so I order the medley potatoes with an egg on top, which runs about $4. But you can get a \"fancy\" breakfast that would feed 2 skinny Europeans for $10, so that's a good deal too. Eat here or don't, but do visit!

It's a mix of a market and cafe with interesting seating and stylish decor.  It's very open and I loved sitting next to the big garage door wall with all the windows.  They have an omelet station where you can pick the size and what you'd like in it.  I chose the Moe cuz I was hungry!!  Was up at 7, did a killer yoga class at 9, went to Mass at 11 and was completely ravenous by the time we arrived.  The Moe omelet was eggs, choice of cheese, choice of veggies and choice of protein.  There were at least 8 veggie selections and if I wanted to I could have had all of them.  I picked mushroom, spinach and onion with bacon for the proteing.  It was served hot, fresh and with a side of nicely salted potato cubes.  It was the perfect size to fill my starving belly.  I'll definitely be back to try the pastries (50% off after 5pm daily!) and some of the ready to take meals.",

I've been in many times - whether for a coffee and dessert after dinner at Golden Phoenix, a quick coffee to go, or to peruse and purchase some yummies for home.  When Ken and Luci are there, the staff is amazing.  When they're not on site (or at least out front) - it's pulling teeth to get the baristas to make a drink.  Last visit, there were THREE people behind the coffee counter, ZERO people on line ahead of me...and I still had to wait for someone to offer to make me something.  And that was to order a drink and pay for over $50 worth of groceries!  I'd think with that much merchandise on the counter by the register, a smile and hello wouldn't be too much to ask.  I may up the stars after one of the cooking classes (if I ever get a Sunday eveing off work!).  And when Ken and/or Luci are there, I'd give the place 4 stars.  I admire what they brought to the area, and adore the concept, layout and selection.  If only the staff were more enthusiastic and customer service oriented.  Maybe I just don't look rich enough, or hipster enough or young enough to be worthy of their time...but I promise, my money spends just as well.",

The main attraction however is the coffee/juice bar.  I had a delicious berry smoothy and was quite pleased with it.  The food is also really good.  The atmosphere is typical of a coffee shop.  I think that I was the only person in the place without a laptop.  There is a television on the back wall that serves no purpose (why I bring this up?  I wonder why it is there in the first place..........)  I recommend it.  Neat decor and a place to get a way for a quick snack or coffee.",

    "text": "Yay another cute place with shitty parking!  Been here a few times to grab coffee and something to eat before work, had the jerk chicken pre-made sandwich which was great-and they don't skimp you on the chicken, nice and hefty I could only eat half the sandwich! Coffee is not spectacular but does the job. I love that they offer green and a specialty iced tea.  Super cute sitting area, I love the open-air atmosphere.   I'm going to chalk it up to the fact that it's brand new...but I can't help but feel like it needs something. It's like you walk in for the first time very excited but leave feeling like...that's it? It needs more, more products, maybe more use of the cooking area in the back, the pastry case needs more than the endless display of slices of cake-which I haven't launched my assault on but intend to.  A welcome addition to the neighborhood nonetheless, I will continue to be back!",

I know it might not sound like a big deal---To go see if there is ham available in the kitchen, and then make up a custom egg bagel for a customer's picky breakfast, but it IS a big deal because it is so simple, and so possible, and so often the answer is just  'no, it's not on the menu', because that's just easier.

    "text": "I have had both good and bad experiences here. The staff are friendly and happy, and their coffee bar delicious. But I can't get over waiting almost an hour while watching people come in and out, on a sidewalk table, cooking in the sun, because the person running the takeouts didn't check the entire restaurant before deciding to abandon finding me. This is despite the fact I was directly outside the front door and glass windows with my table number prominently displayed on the table flag. I finally left my dog, unattended on the sidewalk to go in and find out what happened to be told, \"oh we were looking for you!\" In an almost accusatory tone. I pointed directly through the window to my frantic dog. They asked if I had my number, and I again pointed to the window. I reminded them it had been over 45 minutes since I placed my order. They were unapologetic and even suggestive that it was my fault  because they couldn't find me. I was directly out front and prominently visible!! They wanted me to wait for the manager to decide he was free to talk to me, to which I informed them I could not because my dog was unattended, hot, and without water -I truly did not expect my 8:30 am Saturday breakfast take out run would have me outside in the heat for that long. I got home, a mile away, and the omelet did not look appealing after that long containment in the plastic, and my coffee was no longer hot. I think what left my the most upset (I get it, mistakes can happen) is there was a sense of such a lack of ownership for their mess up to not thoroughly check for their waiting customers. All I wanted was an acknowledgment and apology....",

    "text": "Luci's was such a pleasant surprise. My first stop there was last week. The occasion was to meet to others for a quick business introduction. Initially, I was worried about seating--because it's not as if Luci's provides an assortment of private tables from which to choose. We wound up wedged into a corner table, but that's part of the charm--the closeness that makes it feel like a neighborhood spot.   The highlight was getting my soy latte in a heavy corrugated cup with their classic retro styling. it was beautiful. No one has ever offered me up a soy latte with a design on top in all my years of ordering them. The banter with warm and sincere coffee bar staff was a really fun start to the day and made me wish I lived in the neighborhood so I could make it a part of my day. The spinach quiche was a slight cut above Paradise Bakery's. And it was nice to have the option to order a warm egg item from a coffee shop menu.  The seating probably doesn't lend itself to working meetings, but the rest of the environment is the perfect place to connect with friends at a True neighborhood grocery and coffee spot.",

Having worked in a couple of successful small locally owned health food market cafe combos while still in college I know what is possible.   I was truly expecting more health food and suppliments.  This was more of an upscale QT (I like QTs) with a cafe and a mixed bag of suppliments.  It wasdifficult manuvering through the cafe tables and meandering patrons to get to the market section.  When it came time to check out....maybe I was lost but I didn't find a market only register, just the one at the cafe front was staffed.  It seemed awkward and they acted like they are not used to seeing market items at the register.   Also remember to bring your own bags.  I bought 8 items, forgot my bag and I had to use their basket to get my stuff to my car and then bring their basket back.   I did enjoy my fresh squeezed orange juice I picked up for the road.   I may be back to try the cafe, but I will continue to go to Sprouts for my health food needs.",

    "text": "I don't live nearby, but I was in the area, had heard about the place, and after seeing how busy it was decided to give it a try for breakfast. I got the \"Burrito Bomb\" to go and ate it right away. It was piping hot and tasted good enough (not great and pricey for what it was). The problem came about an hour later: first I started sweating and became very nauseous; then the intestinal symptoms started. Within the next hour I was racing for the toilet: without getting graphic, first out one end then the other.   About 30 minutes later one more round of violent vomiting: and now, 3 hours later, I'm still a bit nauseous but other than that the illness is over. I have a background in science and food safety; and know the difference between food intoxication (when you get sick about an hour after eating and the illness is short-lived); and food infection (when you get sick, sometimes right after eating, and the symptoms last from several days to a week or more). Food infection, commonly called \"food poisoning,\" comes from bacteria infected food that was eaten appx 3-7 days earlier and has been incubating in your body until you finally get sick. People often mistakenly blame the last thing they ate if the onset is right after eating; but the length of the illness lets you know it is really from something eaten days earlier. Conversely, food intoxication actually is from the last thing you ate, and the brevity of the illness makes that clear: it also is not caused by a bacteria, but rather from mishandled food that has become spoiled (e.g. leaving food with mayonnaise out too long, or using something too far past its expiration date). Based on the time of onset and the duration of my symptoms, I know that what made me sick was the Burrito Bomb from Luci's. Since I'm not in that area often, and paid with cash, asking for a refund doesn't make sense; and the likelihood of Luci's paying attention to what happened to me, and looking at their food handling procedures, seems greater if I make my complaint about getting sick from their food public. So that's it, that's my review from the one, and only, time I will eat at Luci's.",

It was my first time there so I got fresh squeezed orange juice and a crab omelette. My friend got the portabello mushroom burger. For spending 15 dollars and the place was packed, I was excited for my breakfast. The waitress was lovely and I will will probably try it again because the people were very friendly. Getting to the point, my omelette was okay but nothing special and pretty small compared to most breakfast places. The potatoes looked beautiful but they came out very mushy actually all the potatoes were super mushy like frozen and microwaved tasting so it was disappointing. My friends mushroom was under cooked and the avocado was way under ripe so overall we were all disappointed with our food. I would expect some fresh food in a health market but nothing was very appetizing. I may go back to check out the market but for the price will not do the food again.",

If they had backed off on the pepper it would have been good, but it was too overwhelming.  Also, they messed up quite a few of our orders, making for some unhappy people.

Ken the owner  was walking around talking to everyone and told us about the work they did to install new trusses in the building .. way cool.

I'd rate the grocery as similar to Trader Joe's but higher end and much smaller.  It's not cheap, but it's what you'd expect in value for the price.  I really like the coffee bar with the roll up garage door and the old fashioned styling.  This place is a wonderful new addition to the neigborhood, I'd love to go back soon.  Too bad they don't serve wine or have wine tastings....but you can't do it all!  I would never go to Starbuck's across the street with this place open.  They serve nice baked goods from Simply Bread (wish they had Tammie Coe and MJ Bread, but you can't have it all), and some delicious cheesecake they buy from some famous place in Chicago.  Free wi-fi!",

I agree with Pamela's sentiment about it being a marriage of TJ's and Hi-Health with AJ's prices.   I've had a couple of bad cups of coffee here, but in the 10-12 times I've been they have always been very nice and have remedied any problem very quickly. If it wasn't on my route, I may not stop here much though. Trader Joe's and Hi-Health are right next door to each other at 20/Camelback and you can save a ton of money if you do it that way!",

I was just thinking that I am sick and tired of using \"starbucks\" as my office away from office and I wanted to find a new place that has access to a patio or some kind of fresh air, internet, and a nice environment to work in.   Well...By George I think I found it!  Luci's is a mix of a vegan/organic market along with a coffee shop.  It has a giant garage door (think Postino) that is open today due to the nice weather and a full selection of coffee and other type quick bites and pastries.  I settled into a nice couch space by a window and am working away on the FREE WiFi sipping one of the best tasting coffee drinks in town and muching on a organic food bar.  Overall, the place feels good and is comfortable enough top come for a casual coffe and read the paper or hit the office work in a better environment.  Plenty of light to do work and also not too crowded so you can have a conversation on the phone or in person.  The only thing left to be desired is the \"barista\" wasn't the fastest man on the planet...but this is Phoenix and its more about quality than fast service here.",

They offer a full breakfast/lunch menu (order @ counter, then delivered to table), plus a unique variety of items that you would find in a boutique-esque grocery store. I've only eaten breakfast here, and many times at that as well as quick stops  for their coffee or a six pack of cold ones. The strawberry waffles were very enjoyable, and the Mrs said the hash browns (mixed with sweet potato hash browns..mmmh!) and the yogurt parfait were also very good.  They have garage style glass doors that are raised during non summer months that allow for a great breeze and view of this busy little intersection. The parking is a bit of a disappointment but I guess you cant win them all. After breakfast or lunch swing by Dick's next door for a drink or wander over to Poor Little Rich Girl for some boutique shopping, great neighborhood spots, wish there were more of them.",

Additionally, I had ordered the lemon burst cupcake which the cashier repeated back to me but never charged me for or gave me. Since I wasn't charged for it I decided it was a sign that I didn't need it!  I had come to do a little work on my laptop. I love my laptop but the battery life SUCKS and I had to sit somewhere with a nearby outlet. The table that I wanted to sit at was dirty. For the entire two hours I was there.  If this was my first, I would have given it 3 stars, but since I know this was all just a fluke, and that Luci's is better than this experience, I will give it 4.  But only 4 for this experience.

    "text": "Walked over today to check it out. Only tried the lemon bar but the menu was pretty extensive and varied. It's a little pricey for me but it smelled great, so it would be something to try when I want to treat myself.  It was very busy which is usually a good sign but the ordering process was a little confusing. The menu on the wall listed drinks only and you had to either order the specials on the chalk board (which wasn't very organized and some didn't have prices listed) or grab a paper menu once you got close enough to the counter. They  had a fridge with salads, yoghurt and juices. No dishes on the food menu were under $5 from what I saw, even a simple plate of eggs and bread. I guess you pay for the \"organic\" bit. However, I couldn't tell what was made there and what was fresh - I assume the baked goods are but the bagels were in bags. It probably says on the menu somewhere... The lemon bar was tasty and very hearty, though it wasn't as flavourful as others I've tried - basically just sweet lemon. I couldn't taste the crust at all.  The staff were all really friendly, and that's always a bonus.  I have plans to go back tomorrow morning to try the breakfast and coffee and will update then.  ---- UPDATE: Went in this morning for coffee and breakfast. Had an egg Sammie (scrambled eggs w/ your choice of cheese, meat and bread) with provolone and bacon on an English muffin. The eggs were very fluffy with real bacon bits mixed in, topped with the cheese and sandwiched in the muffin, sliced in half. It's a decent portion size - however, since this is something I make at home all the time for myself, I'm not sure if the $7 was worth it, but it was still a really good, filling breakfast. I also got a 12 oz. of the day's house blend and added in low fat milk and sugar myself. The coffee wasn't very strong but that's my fault for not asking for the more bold blend. Mom's slice of quiche (which she said was very good), my Sammie, a mocha and a cup of coffee was nearly $20. A little steep but it's a good environment and doesn't feel snobbish like a lot of Whole Foods-type places.   My assessment of this is not a place for the casual, every day diner still stands. This is more of a place to treat yourself. I'll come back but not as a first choice.",

The space itself is cool and has potential.  But...  1.  Many of the goods are the same as in the grocery (some stuff from regular groceries, other stuff from Sprouts/Trader Joes type places) but they cost more.  Five or six bucks for some healthy cereal.  In particular I was disappointed in the wine.  I guess its just my style, but I like a variety of affordable small-production wines.  They had small production wines, just not cheap.  And then they had the same Clois du Bois red wine that has been on sale for $8.99 in Fry's/Albertsons/Safeway for the last five years, except here it was $13.99. 2.  Grabbed a chef salad and a meatloaf sandwich to go.  Salad looked good (and was) - big pieces of chicken and egg - but,....   No dressing!!  The meatloaf was Ok at best, the bread was probably sliced and placed in the box 8 hours ago, and it came with 2 wedges (wedges for a sandwich?) of tomato and two little tiny strings of roasted red pepper.  I had high hopes based on the name/location/etc., but I was disappointed.  Maybe try some quirky grocery items and wines?",

(this time just metaphorically speaking).  I ordered an iced tea at the coffee bar and browsed around a bit.  I bumped into Ken, the owner, who gave me a bit of history and a tour of this adorable boutique-ish neighborhood grocer.  I learned that they revamped their staff from their initial opening, including hiring Chef Eric Guerin, and while I didn't eat while I was there, I will for sure be back to do so soon... the menu looks great; especially their omelet selection!    I could've spent hours looking around - they carry a variety of unique health food, vitamins, and eco-freindly natural products.  I ended up purchasing some vitamins (thanks Lucia for your help with that) and a citrus smelling Weleda brand natural deodorant (I hear so many bad things about regular deodorant, so I am going to give this stuff a shot).

So I suggested a bagel would be fine. The food came and it was lackluster looking. My companion ordered the roast beef sandwich and it looked like a sandwich an 8 year old would make. There was very little meat and cheese and what was there looked like they scraped the bottom of the fridge for them. It was also missing the horseradish mayo. My \"special\" was anything but. The bagel the sandwich was made with was cold while the rest of the ingredients were warm. It also tasted stale and old. The sandwich was also missing the Swiss cheese. This experience saddened me.

I lived most of my life in Austin Tx  and the south prides themselves on their potato salad! Luci's if by far the best! Our real estate agent took us there and I'm still thanking her for a wonderful lunch!   I currently Live in Albuquerque and just ate close to the same sandwich here at Flying star it was repulsive.   Luci's is wonderful and you wont be disappointed!",

    "text": "I was going between four and five stars so I think 4.5 stars is accurate. I went just this morning with my boyfriend before he caught his flight to Iceland (seriously I'm jealous but one of us has to work!) The place is super cute and trendy which is on par for the neighborhood. But the latte I had this morning was one of the best I've ever had it was not too sweet and not bitter at all. I was fighting my boyfriend over it as he was going to wait to get one until we left but then he tried mine and wanted it! I hope Iceland has great coffee babe! We also got the Egg Sammy with scrambled egg, provolone, bacon on a bagel, and the Crazy Monkey French Toast. The Sammy was delicious and had the perfect amount of melted cheese. I love the French toast but my boyfriend was not as thrilled with it but hear me out. It's True it was almost lukewarm instead of hot and my boyfriend said it seemed like it was reheated. While that might be True I personally like my food at a more room temperature, probably so I can eat it a lot faster because I'm a fat kid at heart- so for me it was perfect! The bread was also very dense and I like that it had a lot of texture to it. Unfortunately I moved out of the area about a year ago but I look forward to making this another regular spot for me again! Be sure to check out the shop as they have tons of unique silly items!",

They offer $3 mimosas (at least on the weekend, I am trying to recall) with fresh orange juice.  Those were amazing!    We had the krabby pants omelette and it was pretty good, but I don't think it quite lived up to the price.    Also, prepared for everything to be crowded, you may not mind that at all.  I always find it a little weird to have to stalk people who are almost done eating to grab their tables, it makes for some awkward eye contact.    I would highly recommend for a nice place to unwind and enjoy yourself with company!",

    "text": "I've had my eye on Luci's for a long time, but never made it out this way because it's just a touch too far from my house for breakfast. But, crashing in Phoenix for a while, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to check it out. We came here on a Saturday morning around 9, and there was no wait to order or for a table.   I had the egg sammie, with cheddar and sausage on an Asiago bagel. I was looking for something pretty simple and no frills, but this sandwich was amazing. I had prepared myself for a big ole mess, like most breakfast sandwiches are--especially on a bagel. But the sausage and cheese were folded into the egg, frittata-style, which made for very handy eating. Also... no joke, this was the best bagel I've had in the state of Arizona. It was dense, in a great bagely way, but somehow very soft even though it was toasted. And it even reheated well! The guy is going through an ultra-health kick, so he opted for an acai bowl. It was very tasty, but I think could've been just a touch more frozen/less runny. Also just a touch pricey, but I guess acai bowls usually are.   We both had mimosas, because how can you turn them down then they're $3? I certainly don't have that kind of willpower. They were a touch sweeter than I like, but I fully acknowledge that when I make my own mimosas, they're 96% champagne with 4% juice. And definitely not bad at all for $3.   My favorite part of Luci's for sure were all of the little knick knacks to peruse while you're waiting. Lots of fun AZ things and things no one needs, aka the best things to look through always.   Midway through our meal, we started planning our next trip back. How could we not, when there are so many tasty-sounding menu items to try? :)",

I really enjoy the Acai (Amazonian fruit) super fruit bowl. They have a good collection of baked goods, and a wonderful variety to choose from. The drink selection is satisfying as well.     Luci's has great seating, I never have trouble finding a seat. This seating including about seven bar stools in front of where the chefs cook food.        In the middle of all the seating, there is a gourmet grocery and assortment of retro toys like wind up toys, fake glasses, books, pranks, and much more. Great small gift ideas. The store is always nice to browse, and in the middle of the rest of the restaurant. The overall pricing is moderate.        I highly recommend Luci's for all who are looking for a comfy, enjoyable meal.",

The menu is full of breakfast options from egg sandwiches to big full size flapjacks and lox and bagels and breakfast burritos to cure your hangover. They also have sandwiches and salads for quick on the go options and grab and go bottled drinks. The food is delicious and cooked to order and many can be gotten gluten free or veggie options. The coffee is above average and beats out Starbucks for sure and is still priced around the same as them or even less. If you've never been, I highly recommended checking it out.

First, you walk in to their adorable marketplace with so much to look at. If you're in need of a unique gift, come to Luci's, they're sure to have something that will catch your eye!  For breakfast, I ordered their Acai Bowl and my friend and I split a gluten free bagel. You guys, the bagel was DELICIOUS! Not all gluten free bagels are the bees knees but this one WAS. I also had an iced latte! The Acai bowl could have been a little colder and not as runny. It also didn't have much to it for over $10. Just the Acai mixture, bananas, blueberries, and some granola. Pretty basic. It wasn't the best one that i've ever had. I also love that they're dog-friendly! I'll definitely think about bringing my furbaby in the future! It is kind of pricey for breakfast. For my pretty simple breakfast it was $20 which seemed a little high. Anywho, I love the ambiance - good vibes all around - so we'll be back!",

I haven't had the chance to return to order my favorite drink again, but had the chance to speak to one of the owners who was very pleasant and professional. I even received a gift card for my troubles. I have never had that experience before, though I used to hear stories of great customer service from my mom from places she frequented back in the day, I hadn't had any till I spoke to Luci's management team. I will definitely continue to shop, eat and drink at Luci's knowing that if I have a problem again it will be addressed and corrected. Thank you for caring for your customers.",

Seeing the signage while driving made me take note of Luci's and since I was in the neighborhood, I decided to get my coffee fix. The parking lot seems to be a bit small and caters to both Luci's and the other businesses sharing the plaza, but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw several spots open on a Saturday afternoon. Walking into Luci's brings you to the cafe area, where you can peruse some beverages and premade food items before stepping up to the counter to order. On top of coffees and teas, you can also order pastries or meals, both of which I was tempted to order but somehow managed to walk away with only a latte. The latte I ordered was good, though it was about a solid dollar more than what I'm used to paying at other coffee shops. I was kind of in a rush this time around, but I'll be back in to explore the little shop inside soon!",

The worst part was that when I ordered a bagel, the cashier told me it wasn't fresh enough to serve and subsequently had to find me a fresh bagel by feeling the plastic bags of bagels. . .

Each time I've been there on a weekend morning, one of the registers was not working correctly.  Menus are not easily accessible until you get to the counter to order.  This can be really annoying because either you know what you want or you have to wait a few minutes until the people in front of you decide what they want to eat while 5 people behind them are waiting patiently.  And the cashier is pretty slow.  The pricing seemed reasonable however it was $8.99 for french toast (3 pieces-no bacon or saugage included) and around $2.50 for their organic coffee.  The food came out hot and looked great although it was way sweet to me.  Too sweet to actually finish and I love french toast but not Luci's.  I will give them another try because it's local and close to my house.  I heard there's Jazz on certain nights, so will have to try out dinner.",

I first fell in love with this place when I was trying to find a coffee place that caters to Vegan tastes (meaning, having vegan milk other than Soy). I was coming in for almond milk & soy milk lattes with hazelnut flavoring, when one day I came in and their espresso machine wasn't working. Samantha suggested for me to try the \"Toddy\" coffee with my usual flavoring, I did and I AM A TODDY FANATIC!!! I come in atleast once a day for this amazing drink. I did some research online about Toddy and it turns out it is great for people who love coffee but can't have it because of digestive upsets. SInce it is cold-brewed it has 67% lower acidity levels than hot-brewed coffee. They even named the drink I get because I come in so much, seriously, ask for it \"The Jennoddy\" No Joke. I like recycling so I re-use my cup as well (I have the 32oz & 20oz ones) and they give you a discount for reusing your cup! They also have great snacks for kids so it's no biggie if you need to bring in your little one. I love that this place is Truely independant and the employees actually care about you as not only a customer, but a person (unlike their across the street diagonal corner neighbors).",

I get so tired of having to shop in several stores (usually Whole Foods, Fresh & Easy and Fry's) to fill my pantry and still feeling as if I missed out. Today, I discovered Luci's and was I in HEAVEN! Not only do they carry most of the gluten-free items I already use, but they carry so many I have never tried! (All items are competitively priced, too!) Additionally, they have cold beer and freshly baked goods on-hand! Ken, the store owner, literally gave me a 20-minute tour of the store, made several helpful product suggestions, and then had his barista create an iced, drip coffee with rice milk for me! For anyone that knows me, this makes Ken a keeper! I generally avoid coffee bars because none seem to carry rice milk (which is my favorite alternative to dairy; soy is too harsh for me, too). Ken assured me Almond Milk is also available. As great as all of these points are, the best is that Luci's is a locally-owned business.  Oh, and they host cooking classes on Sunday nights. I will be back and I will be telling everyone about this place to the point of annoyance...  :)",

    "text": "I've gotten my daily grind @ a national chain coffee shop on 16th st & Bethany home rd for quite som time until wandering into Luci's Healthy Marketplace on the opposite corner. Talk about day vs. night!! Luci's harks back to the days of the neighborhood market/coffee house where the propriator and employees not only know your name but how you like your morning Joe! I find that the people working here genuinely ENJOY doing so and are eager to give their customers the kind of experience that is all too often missing in todays frenetic world. I had been meaning to try something from their dinner menu and recently had the opportunity. The home made chicken pot pie sounded like just the thing to brighten up a rainy day so I ordered up one and had a seat at the counter in front of the chef. It isnt often that you get to sit and watch your food prepared to order before your eyes but here I was, comfortably enjoying a conversation with a few other patrons and chatting with the chef while he prepared my meal. The pot pie comes in a HUGE tin which lends itself to transport home, filled with a thick, hearty broth LOADED with fresh perfectly prepared vegetables and plump, juicy chicken. Gently placed atop of the filling is a lite, flaky puff pastry shell which gives the pie the perfect amount of texture and crunch. I REALLY hoped this pie tasted as good as it looked and soon enough I was able ta put spoon to meal and enjoy my first bite...the verdict...it was DELICIOUS!!!! that this is probably the BEST pot pie i've EVER had from the most unlikely of locations is a testament to the involvement of the owners, Ken & Luci Schnitzer who can be found daily making their customers feel like welcomed family. I HIGHLY recommend dropping in to have a meal, a superbly prepared coffee drink or some of their ADDICTIVE house iced tea...a Mediterranean pomagranite citrus green tee.",

I guess it can be looked at as a convenience vs travel all the way to sprouts, trader Joe or whole foods.  The prices are on the high side for their frozen foods and the prepared meals. Tuna Salad with some lettuce was like $8.00. I saw other salads like this for over $7.00. The only realistic deal seemed to be a meatloaf sandwich at $6.00. The juices and other beverages were also over priced much like whole foods. I don't understand how a brand new health store can open during this time and charge the same amounts as Whole foods when trader Joe has a greater variety and way cheaper prices. IMO, I think the extra 2 mile drive is worth it due to the small selection and high prices. Maybe they did the demographics and the neighborhood poeple don't mind spending the extra buck. I just don't see any benefits. Seems to me like they are trying to do alittle of everything and not concentrating on something to make them unique.",

I had the breakfast burrito with bacon and avocado & a vanilla latte that set me back $5.25(!).  I'm not really a coffee snob -- mostly a Dunkin' Donuts coffee kinda gal -- and this was nice & smooth, but certainly not $5.25 nice.  Now I looove breakfast burritos, and this one had an awesome variety of local potatoes in it + sweet potatoes that made this a nice little burrito.  There was no avocado on my burrito though, but it was easy enough to let someone know, and they gave me a few slices.  The ambiance is super cute, and I like all of the organic/natural/pretending to be organic & natural under the guise of excellent packaging drinks, groceries, and knickknacks that are lying around.  I wanted to try many of the desserts in the counter, but will give them a shot if I ever come back.  Food is a solid 3, but ambiance and friendly service compel me to give this place 4 stars, but ultimately needs improvement for price point.",

There is a general store type inside with healthy food items and a lot of  \"stuff\" like little oddities which I didn't get a chance to look around as to how busy and compact the area was.   Parking......OMG....haha. It is freakin a nightmare, good luck with that! There is parking in the back but even that was packed when I went. It is on a busy corner and the strip mall is busy itself with very limited parking so it make take you a minute to find a spot. Just know that in advance and you'll be great .

    "text": "I live down the street from Luci's and sadly for me, I won't be visiting them any longer. First, they're slow and they are pricey.  I paid $10 for a dragon fruit bowl-- it was served in a cute, shallow wood bowl but the strawberries and kiwi that topped the bowl were gross! The strawberries were too soft and the kiwi was hard and SOUR, which was even worse because they gave me a lot of it (which would be great if they had better produce) A few days later I decided to try again and  came in and order 2 to go, substituting bananas and blueberries instead of the strawberries and kiwi.  We also paid $2 for extra granola ($1 each) since there wasn't much on the previous bowl. After waiting for 15+ minutes for my smoothie bowls, they arrived and they were in a much SMALLER container than the other day when I ordered it to eat in the restaurant.  Also, there were 4 banana slices and 2 blueberries on both of the smoothies, WHAT?? our \"extra\" granola that we paid for never showed, there was a tablespoon AT MOST.  We called and complained about this because it was so expensive (about $22 after tax) and we were told by a manager, Elizabeth, that they would leave a gift card up at the front for us the next time that we came in.  Within a few days I called in an order for another 2 smoothie bowls, again substituting in bananas and blueberries and extra granola.  After my arrival they said there was no such gift card but they could give me $2 off order to pay for my extra granola that I didn't receive the previous time... At that point I didn't feel like arguing so I took the offer. When my smoothie bowls arrived the fruit was in the bottom, they were hardly over  3\\4 of the way through and the 2nd smoothie bowl and hardly any grandola and zero fruit.   I may ususally be more forgiving because they live so close to me, but I don't look forward to getting ripped off again. Luci's has been a waste of my money and a waste of my time. I will not be going back.",

I ordered the huevos rancheros and it was AMAZING! I felt like the side of lintels should have been served hot but they were still delicious. $15 for the rancheros and a small chai. The chai was delicious. They don't have dome lids so if you ask for whipped cream you won't be getting a full drink. Over all I would definitely recommend this place. It's different, healthy and delicious.",

Even as a split plate is was a good size and made for an affordable $4.50 each ($9ish total)  The eggs were as expected, I was surprised by the meddely of potatoes including purple ones, it was good and unusual. The fruit was nothing too special. What made the meal great was a decent selection of small label hot sauces.  In the market they had some nice gourmet pickles, something I had been looking for some time.   My one complaint is that the meals and other things seem to be about 20% higher priced then I would like to see.",

    "text": "My review is actually on the meal service that Luci's provided for Thanksgiving.  The family had some issues to deal with over the holidays and the thought of creating a big meal was overwhelming so I shopped around and after much debate settled on Luci's for the meal.  I really can't describe how happy I was with my choice.  The food was AMAZING.  I've had pre-bought meals like this before, but this actually all tasted like something that came out of a kitchen with a cook that cared about what they were serving to their own guests.  Seasonings were pronounced, yet mild and the fresh herbs could be seen throughout.  There were options to select from and rather than getting piddly little portions, you received enough to actually feed a family.  The highlights of the meal were the mashed potatoes (seriously how they made these is still beyond me because they were SO light and fluffly), the green bean caserole that was better than anything coming out of that campbell's can, the seasonal salad that could be substituted for any side, and the turkey itself.  Every single person at the table raved about each component of the meal and the fact that it was made with locally sourced ingredients just makes it all the better.  To top everything off, they loaded everything into the car and the packaging was perfect for both transport as well as storage (because there were a ton of leftovers).  I will absolutely do this again and would recommend them to anyone looking to simplify while still holding on to traditions.  Call ahead because I was told that I literally got the last meal as they had not counted on them being so popular but don't call too far ahead becuase I might have to fight you for your turkey. :)",

While the layout is somewhat confusing, if not overwhelming to a newcomer - the fun is in the discovery: they have coffee .. And sandwiches ... And beer! And wine! And healthy things ... Etc. I got a turkey, avocado and pesto sandwich that was fresh, didn't skimp on the avocado (big plus), and delicious. Washed it down with a can of Scottish ale (for $1.97).    Beyond the drinks and food there is also a small market comprised of mostly holistic and natural products, which I'm a fan of. You can also bring home random trinkets should the mood strike.   Overall, a fun quirky place with seemingly delicious eats and drinks.",

If you're in a hurry they have salads pre made daily with a HUGE selection of every kind of beverage. I've even met friends here and bought a 6 pack of Angry Orchard from their market to drink on premise. Way less expensive than a bar and the atmosphere can't be beat.",

So the customer service was not 5 star worthy.  This was the first time I've ever eaten at Luci's. This is an order at the counter restaurant and food will come to you. The gentleman that helped me out was great! Put my order in for the avocado toast and then my food comes out. The delivery/waiting time was as expected 10-15mins.. they were pretty busy. Presentation.. instagram worthy.   I'm two bites in and I see a hair in my avocado spread.. the thought of it right now is grossing me out because strands of hair grossed me out in general and when it's in my food... no coming back. I take my food to the counter and I ask the young lady behind the counter that I found a hair in my food and if I could get another one made due to that.. she says \"avocado toast?\" Ahh yeah.. that's what's in my plate. There is no I'm sorry, or any action that was taken to apologize for my experience. I was very disappointed.

The food is exceptional and the business deserves our support.  I appreciate the validation of being a good customer and I appreciate the effort made to keep me as a repeat customer.   Love local owners that you want to hug and a business that makes you feel welcome. Whether grabbing coffee or a meal.",

We decided to come here for breakfast, my girls split the gluten feee pancakes with banana, I had the Sunrise Omelette, and my husband had the Spaniard omelette, we also ordered a side of bacon.  My omelette was the best omelette I've ever had!  My husband and daughters were also very pleased with their breakfasts.  The green pomegranate Iced tea was good, but a little weak.  We really liked our food, but it was a little costly as we paid over $50 for breakfast which with no service seems a little costly.  The food portions were huge though and the quality was great.  I'd certainly come back.  Try the Sunrise Omelette!  You won't be disappointed.",

When I asked her to make sure she puts the names on the orders as there are multiple she responded with, \"I always make sure I put the names on there\". Um, okay. Was just making sure because people tend to forget.    After getting all my orders in I told her that this was for pick up at a later time to which she goes, \"oh. I already sent it to the back. Normally you only have to call right before you pick up because it doesn't take that long to make. You should have told me it was for a future order.\" Maybe because you didn't ask?   Every other place I've ever had to put an order in has either asked me if this was for now or the future or weren't so presumptuous to send orders off without making sure of time.   This used to be a top spot where I would go here to pick up lunches for my company. I don't think I'll be coming back because of the lack of customer service from the girl on the phone.",

The windows offer plenty natural light and I usually didn't have trouble finding a table with outlet access although they are limited. Parking was never an issue either. I recently brought my friend here as we were looking for something small/light for breakfast as we had plans elsewhere for brunch. We opted for the Acai bowl which we both really enjoyed. We couldn't pass the cactus macaroons; we both just really missed Phoenix and cacti macaroons were not just visually appealing but tasted good too. During prior visits, breakfast never disappointed. There is also an adjunct shop offering a variety of little goods, some full of humor which could make an interesting and fun gift; however I find the items to be overpriced. Nonetheless, it makes a fun window shopping experience while awaiting your food.  Go back: Yup!",

I have gone to Luci's for a long time and this is a huge disappointment, if I'm going to pay over 10 dollars for an omelette, please have your staff wear hair nets if they have long hair, throwing this whole thing in the trash. Gross!   Someone contacted me through yelp claiming \"they don't work for lucis, and that they have been in the restaurant business a long time\" (sounds fishy huh?) very believable. Stating I should not recommend wearing hair nets at any restaurant because if you walk into one where they wear hair nets, it means it's a bad place to eat? Here is why I said it, ...it means it helps the hairs not fall in my food! They also said I shouldn't give them 1 star reviews and contact the manager instead of writing reviews, sorry, this is what yelp is for \"non employee\" of lucis. Thanks!",

When I arrived there was a long line as I suspected. I asked the tall lady with dark hair making drinks/coffee if I should wait in line or pick up with her.  She told me I could pick it up there with her. Then continued to fill drink orders so drinks were actually piling up and ignored me until there was only one person in line. I walked to the register and told the cashier that the lady told me to she'd get to me but never did but he ignored my comment and read the total.  I didn't want to make a huge deal so I paid as he grabbed a bag of food that had been sitting right next to the coffee lady on the counter.  Now I'm home with cold food. Thanks a lot!   I'm hoping to chalk this up to them having a bad day for both employees to have fallen short of being the amazing crew that's usually there.  UPDATE: I'm adding a star for Sarah being so responsive. Just trying to avoid it from happening again to anyone else. :)",

I still visit Phoenix as often as possible (I can't help it, I love it more all the time) and I want to see the whole area around 16th street and Bethany get better as it ages. Living in Seattle, we all think we know coffee, wine, micro beer, healthy food, etc. So I entered Luci's with my NW snobbery firmly in place developed by 10 years of rain soaked passive-aggressive existential angst. Long story kind of short, the place is really cool, great coffee, friendly people working it, strong food, good grocery selection, etc. I went back 3 times in 4 days, I will definitely be back again. Sure you feel like the cars on 16th are sitting at the table with you, so what. It's a great addition to the 'hood. Now if they can just do something nice with that old deserted Bashas property.",

Our planned destination was Piestewa Peak but we were off course, so way off course.  After running around aimlessly for a bit, posing for pics and climbing a small hill we headed to Luci's for breakfast. We were really looking forward to it as it was a first visit for the both of us. The space is really cool, interesting products, great layout, a cool diner counter and super friendly staff. All that being said, my meal (egg Sammy on asiago bagel) was average and fell just a tad short of my expectations considering the anticipation and how great it read on the menu.  On a brighter side, David was thrilled with his \"special request\" latte. Evidently there are restrictions on allowable ounces on coffee products sold. He had his heart set on a super size big gulp version of a latte and the staff being super accommodating allowed for this \"one time\" exception and in my eyes a redeeming point lost on my Sammy.  Luci, for this I grant you back the lost point and a promise to return in the near future.  Thank you.",

I'm really happy with what they have done with the place and they have a great idea going. Only problem is that they might need to expand with it. I walked in expecting more of a small grocer/cafe but found it to be mostly a nutritional supplement store with slim pickins. The prepared foods section is scary tiny, with only one vegetarian option. The grocery section is tiny and reminds me of some sort of mash up between Sprouts/Healthy Habit/Cost Plus. Overall an interesting place and idea but needs to improve the selection/variety of specialty grocery goods and pre-prepared foods.",

I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner there & so far my fave (by far) has been the lunch.  Their roast beef sammie was fab!!  Sadly, you can't order from their lunch menu after 5p.  Recently I had their pasta plus protein.  Same as with the breakfast omlettes, you can upgrade your basic selection a little at a time.  So, start with pasta & your choice of sauce.  Next level would be to add veggies ( a choice of about 5 or so), and from their, you can upgrade to adding protein - choice of chicken or shrimp - while still having veggies.  Like the concept and a HUGE portion, but the pasta had a funky texture.  Maybe I got gluten free by mistake.  You can stop in here for a quick treat or to pick up some healthy alternatives, but it's not a regular pick of mine.  OH!  I almost forgot the cooking classes!  What a fantastic idea and I love that they are offered by category.  I can't wait until the \"Knife Skills\" class comes back.  I've always wanted to chop & dice like a pro!",

I am going to have to go back there and try that some time.",

You get to scoop the cream off the top and enjoy. I like to enjoy the entire bottle in one sitting, because it is the only milk I have been able to drink with out severe tummy trouble. Luci herself is often at the store when we visit and is one of the sweetest women I have met in my life. One time our order got messed up and she gave us free dessert and drink coupons. I used those drink coupons to discover their Green Tea smoothie thing (with soy) DELICIOUS! Since it's become a busier hot spot, you may have to wait a while before ordering your coffee or food, but it has never disappointed and is a great investment of your time. Oh, and FREE Wi-Fi. Eat your heart out Starbucks across the street.",

    "text": "We recently moved to the area and were happy to find such a unique little market, but after going there several times in the last 4 months I'm a little underwhelmed.  They could easily be a 4-5 in my book if they made some changes, but at the current state they are fairly a 3. The atmosphere I love, colors, theme and overall look but they are lacking in consistency and very limited vegan options (zero for breakfast that I could tell).  The best part about this place is the soy coconut lattes which are to die for (if you happen to get a good one).....the problem is you've got about a 50/50 chance of that actually happening.  Sometimes they suck altogether.  The service is also very inconsistent....there always seems to be one super friendly hard working person and then someone that is just standing around sucking up air and not helping the other person even when there is a line 10 back.  I always end up feeling bad for the poor guy stuck doing all the work and over tip for a shitty $5 cup of coffee because they are too busy to put together a decent latte.  Also, they offer vegetarian and vegan cooking classes but very few vegan options on the menu? They do have a decent selection of frozen and dry vegan options that you can buy but 30% higher than other places which I understand is because they don't have the buying power other places do but sorry I'm not going to be doing much shopping there.  I will continue going back because I don't know another place that has coconut lattes and am hoping that some day I'll walk in and see some more vegan options.",

Finding a parking spot was kind of hard, we drove around twice & then finally someone was backing out so we scored a spot. We made our way over to the cafe side & looked over the menu. I got the strawberry patch salad (added chicken) & my mom got the veggie head salad. For drinks I got the pomegranate citrus iced tea & my mom, who always asks if places carry diet sprite/7up (they NEVER do), settled for a stevia sweetened lemon-lime soda. I LOVED my salad, although I wish the chicken was grilled, my mom said hers was pretty good. I really liked my iced tea, so refreshing! My mom said  she didn't like her soda, but she drank it all so it probably wasn't that bad. Total for our salads & drinks was about $25. Seems a lil pricey to me, which initially was the reason I wanted to give Luci's 3 stars, but that open garage is just way too cool, so 4 stars it is. If I wasn't trying to be healthy that day I so would have sampled some of the yummy looking desserts, they all looked amazing!",

Offering breakfast, lunch and dinner, the place is cozy, fun and inviting. We love the Saturday Night Jazz and the great \"small bites\" from Chef Larry are the highlight of our week. He's personable, knowledgeable and a great Chef. We LOVE the food on Saturday, but can't say the same for during the week.    Food has been sloppy, uneven on occasions, and plates are often messy during the weekday meals. Spotty shortages and lack of consistence makes for an frustrating experience.   The coffee bar had great promise as well, but lately, Customer Service and Sanitation and organization has been spotty. Employees are often overwhelmed and look distracted, and the cafe is often messy and looks unclean.  If Luci's keeps up with the cleanliness, Customer Service and stays True to it's pleasant neighborhood concept, it'll do really well. Lots of competition now on this corner.   Don't drop the ball, guys !  Management and the kitchen needs to step it up and keep us coming back !",

I especially enjoy going to Luci's because the place has a good down-to-earth atmosphere, and their staff is friendly.  They also have on Sundays a a musician come in to sing and strum a few melodies on the guitar, which is nice to hear just before the hustle-&-bustle work week begins.

Within the past month I have started having some seriously crappy experiences.  I am willing to wait for my food, I am in no rush and certainly don't mind relaxing in the sun at the roll-up door for a bit.  But when I have to wait for my coffee for an exceptionally long amount of time only for it to be made wrong, I am annoyed.  I am even more annoyed when someone is in line behind me has their order made before mine because they are friends with the staff.  And then my drink is made incorrectly on top of that.  This has happened multiple times and I think it is incredibly rude!!  I am most annoyed when my significant other is forced to wait 15 minutes for a simple egg sandwich and a bagel, goes to inquire with the staff behind the counter and has to wait for them to finish their gossip before he is addressed.  And his food order had been completely forgotten and must wait even longer now.  There is one barista there that I can handle, he's been there for a long time and knows what he is doing and is efficient and pleasant every time I see him, and that gets them the 2 stars they have from me.  All the other counter staff are awful!  We will not be going back.",

Where they fall short is the food.  The menu is inconsistent and seems to change with the moon phase.  Recently I went in to order \"dinner\" only to find out what used to be an actual \"dinner\" menu with awesome comfort foods is now just the \"lunch\" menu extended.  With all of that said... let me tell you the second thing that disappointed me about Luci's.  I ordered the meatloaf sandwich.  I was told it was close to the old \"dinner\" menu meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  I asked for the sandwich with NO BREAD!  Guess what?  Yep, it was brought 20 minutes later to the table with bread!  Guess what?  They fixed it by scraping the meat off the bread and bringing it back!  This is great for a place that prides it self in being \"food allergy friendly\".  I sure hope that the owner sees that this is affecting her business.  I used to recommend this establishment to friends.  I will think twice now before I tell a friend about \"the cool place on the corner\".",

I'm always excited to find a grocery store that carries an array of health-conscious items!  We discovered that Luci's had many gluten-free/organic options that I normally can't find anywhere else!  Loved all the openness in the cafe area, the entire atmosphere was very warm and inviting.  I could definitely sit there a few hours and get all cozy with a warm 'cup of joe' and my laptop.  Also liked that the cafe contained stevia sweetener packets and agave nectar--that's a really awesome and rare find!  The barista made me feel extra special when he asked if I wanted some of their homemade whipped cream!!!  I couldn't refuse when he explained it was made from agave nectar, vanilla bean, and espresso--and I must say it was totally YUM!  V kept dipping her stir stick in my doppio for more!    Veronica made a good point today when she expressed how neat it is that more and more people are leaning towards a better way of eating--I couldn't help but agree!

Their sandwiches are delicious and if you get both their macaroni salad and potato salad together its a great combination.  Their breakfast, however, not as great - mostly basic breakfast foods without much fanfare to them.  Free wi-fi. It has a different atmosphere from your basic coffee shop but it's a nice change if you are looking for a change in environment.  They have a live jazz band on Saturdays - haven't been able to make one yet.  Overall a pretty neat place .",

    "text": "After dropping $100 at the nursery this morning for my new patio, I needed something for breakfast and a nice iced tea.  My neighbors told me about Luci's and I've driven by a half dozen times. You can build an omelet there by the size: Eeny (just egg), Meeny (egg and cheese), Miny (egg, cheese and veggies), and Moe (all the above with a protein).  I had a piece of spinach quiche.  I also ordered a large iced tea.  Well, I was sipping my tea, waiting for the quiche to be heated.  And waited.  Finally, after bumping into my massage therapist (she's the BEST!), I asked about it.  They had forgotten me.  :{  Oh well, they offered a free Danish to make up for it while they heated up my quiche.   They have a section of teas and different foods.  It's a small section and the prices are a little higher than you'd find at Sprouts. I'll be back a million times, since it's so close to home. Let's hope they don't forget me next time ;}",

    "text": "What a disappointment.  I pass by Luci's a lot and always say \"one day I'm gonna stop in.\"  Well that day came and I wish I had saved my $18.  I ate as much as I could bear, about half.  So for $18 I was half full.    Before I tell what I purchased, let me say that the place is way too crowded.  There's a diner-like section with seating area, grocery aisles, non-grocery knickknacks, coffee bar with seating area, patio.  I'm sorry, the floor space is poorly designed.  I had to ease on down the twisty winding road to go place an order.  And what a tight spot that was!  So, a slice of \"mile high\" carrot cake set me back about $5, (maybe $5.50).  Please stop calling it Mile High. It was only three regular layers of cake with just a sugary  white layer of frosting.  The size was not mile high, and the taste did not take me high either.  It'll do, though, if you're longing for cake.  The wild salmon with pesto was $11.  I asked for a wrap instead of bread.  It looked good, but was completely overcooked and I could taste no pesto at all.  I opened the wrap and found a smear of green oil, so the intent of pesto was there, but 'twas a worthless effort.  And the side of tater tots...Ummm, how can I put this nicely?  Fyuck!  They did not taste freshly made.  I should have opted for the side of fruit.  Oh well, next time.  Oh wait, there won't be a next time.  I've done the Luci thing.  No need to do it again.",

    "text": "Worst service ever!!!!! Asked the server to watch our party eaten meal so I could talk a child to the bathroom and he agreed. Came back to the table in just a few minutes and all was gone including the child's toys. There was now new patrons sitting at the table. When I approached the server his response was to say I'll get the manager (never once stating he was sorry or explaining what happened).   After a few minutes the manager came over and gave me the child's toys and said she was sorry. She advised she had refunded the entire meal back to my credit card and handed what looked like a business card. I left the restaurant at that point and drove away.   As I was driving I went to look at the business card she gave me and found a gift card for $13, my meal was $22. I also realized this was her version of a refund.....   I return to the restaurant and contacted her again and ask what the $13 was for and she advised is was my refund... I explained my meal was $22 and asked how she decided on $13 (she then tried to explain but in the end what came out was she guessed based on what the server said I had on the table). I explained what I had paid and showed her the charge in my credit card (on my mobile phone app). She then went to try to give me another gift card and I had to push to get the refund. In the end I received a full refund.   I wish the experience had been better. What food I had a chance to eat seemed good. Too bad... I won't Ever Go Back!!!!",

Sure it's crowded but who can blame a place for being popular? Not this Yelper.  That said, my verdict has always been out on Luci's. Not that it really matters because the place has like 300 reviews so its rating isn't going anywhere, but every visit I've had is just somewhat imperfect. Nothing big to scream about -- but small mistakes here and there.   For example, yesterday we ordered our breakfasts plus 1 small and 1 medium coffee. The cashier rings it up then says, \"We're currently out of small cups so they'll both be in mediums.\" So when our name is called and we grab the coffees, there are two medium cups but one is just partially full. Like, seriously, what is that? You're really going to skimp on the few ounces of DRIP COFFEE? Who does that? How do you even know you gave us the volume of a small and didn't short us? I get that she said they'd both be in medium cups but, man, talk about seeming cheap!  So that's the kind of stuff that just eats away at me, visit after visit. I want to love Luci's the way so many others do but they JUST won't let me. It's hard when it's always SOMETHING and, I don't know, I think maybe I'll just have to accept that Luci's just isn't for me.",

It made me uncomfortable as well. These guys are working their butts off to provide delicious meal and the hostess manager is micromanaging their efforts. I would rather wait for my food to be prepared correctly than to have it rushed. My friend and I told the cooks they were doing an excellent job and thanked them for the delicious breakfast.

A few months back, they were on Channel 3 during their Saturday morning broadcasts.  Parking here's a bit limited, but not bad.  I imagine if you were to come here on a busy week night it might be different, but overall not bad.  I walked in and really liked what I saw.  Cute setup, with a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Healthy without the feeling of eating or being sold bark instead of real food.  I initially wanted dinner, but decided on a bagel with cream cheese instead.  Here's where they loose a star.  ok, so on their menu, they have a bagel, cream cheese and lox combo for $6.99.  It comes with the onions, capers, tomato's and everything else that normally goes with a plate like this.  Well, I told the girl that I just wanted something lite, and if I could get a bagel with lox and cream cheese only.  She told me it was $8.99?  um, Can't you sell me the $6.99 bagel lox n cream cheese thing and leave the capers out of it? Why the extra $2?  Maybe I misheard...but if I didn't, that's kind of weird!  Why wouldn't she just sell me the $6.99 one?  Anyways, I ended up going with just a bagel and cream cheese with lemon water.  Bagel was great, and the cream cheese with whipped and appeared to be made in house!  They also serve breakfast all day, which I thought was awesome!  Totally my gig, as I sometimes like to mix it up and have breakfast for dinner on the weekends.    Place is wonderfully decorated, staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  Bathrooms are pretty cool and clean for the most part.  I will say, I absolutely love how this place is decorated.  Totally my style.",

    "text": "My friend and her husband told me about this place since they know I: 1) love a good cup of joe, 2) am a bit of a health nut (arguably contradictory with #1 I know), and 3) like to support local/family-owned businesses.  That being said, it seemed Luci's was a match made in heaven.    I agree with the majority of the other Yelpers that the coffee is pretty good.  I love the fact that they offer unsweetened vs. regular/vanilla soy because my usual poison of choice is a caramel soy latte but it's usually too sweet for me unless the unsweetened soy is used (how I make it myself at home).  Anyways, so the coffee is pretty great, and the food was decent, but I think it's a bit pricey for what you get.  I ordered an omelette which was tasty but the potatoes weren't that flavored or special.    The service can be a bit unpredictable, perhaps because the one time we had bad service was on a weekend vs. the other times I've gone during the week...I know that's not an excuse, just an observation.  My friend's wife ordered a macchiato but apparently they didn't know what that was even though that was on the menu, and the girl at the register messed up on our order 3 times.    Despite all that, I would still go back for the coffee, and wouldn't mind ordering their food again.  Also, they have a cool selection of vegan/gluten free/organic products to check out while you're waiting for your order.",

I honestly can't understand how the cashiers can be so distracted, unless having ADHD is part of the requirement to get hired here.  And as for other commenters who have found the staff \"friendly,\" I have not really noticed that.  They aren't unfriendly, but they are in my opinion, much too spacy to really be friendly in any meaningful way.  Although, it has belatedly occurred to me that maybe they are all just high...",

There was nothing special that I couldn't get elsewhere. We went there for brunch and since the breakfast menu offered such an average selection, we ordered a sandwich instead. I don't recommend the Po Boy sandwich, which took over 20 minutes to make and tasted like s***. Sorry, but this is the reason why Phoenix is always missing something that urban cities have . . . character, taste, and uniqueness.   Don't get me wrong, we need more healthy food markets that are independently owned but Luci's standard for food and selection of what they sell is an extreme disappointment and even an embarrassment.",

Looks like they forgot to build a big parking lot for this grocery store also. Nothing on the shelves could not be found at either Whole Foods or Sprouts. The pastries and bagels are not made on site, therefore it's best to utilize the sandwiches or egg/pancake fresh items made to order. Great choice on my part going with the breakfast bomb (burrito). A very unusual version made with alot of very colorful potatoes, most of which are organic because there were sweet, purple, yellow and white potatoes in there. Other ingredients were only eggs of course, finely chopped hickory bacon and cheddar cheese, but not alot like in Mexican places. Also, you get your choice of three tortillas flavors and sun-dried was my choice. Great burro for $7.99 and worth it for the solid parts inside. It looks nothing like any standard Mexi burrito. They give you a nice mild salsa on the side, but you will need more if you eat the whole thing (a challenge unless your starved). Grabbed a fresh lemonade at $3.25 for a good holiday breakfast.",

I'm not a fan of cutesy names - I finished junior high long, long ago. The omelet was good - probably 3.8 out of five. A shade too salty which overwhelmed the omelet elements. The potatoes were also just a bit too salty, but did have several different kinds of potatoes - 4.3.  The small cup of fruit is the best I've had in a restaurant in ages. Everything in it was perfectly ripe and there were a good number of fresh pineapple pieces in it. 5.0.  I got water to drink - I'm really cheap. Breakfast was close to $12 with $1 tip - a bit much.  The decorations and merchandise sorta shoves that cutesy/kitschy vibe down your throat.  Gag. I'm not admitting there are several things I'm considering buying. No, not admitting that.   A good place for people watching.  Will I be back?  Ummmm . . . Not a great value and not all that healthy.  Those sweets do look very tempting . . . Which is bad, very bad. I probably will be back, but . . .  I'm ambivalent.  Oh, and most irritating of all was the young man who referred to me several times as \"young lady\".  I'm old enough to be his mother, if not grandmother.  So, I felt patronized and insulted. I considered making some crabby comment to him, but, as an old woman, I've learned to put up with obnoxious,  cutesy whippersnappers. And, yes, I am crabby with a c, not a k - krabby is obnoxious and cutesy.  I may be obnoxious, but certainly not cutesy.",

We both had our eyes on the same sandwiches- The Zeus and The Juan with a side of sweet potato fries.   The owner was also present and gave us a little history about the neighborhood, his establishment and the types  of patrons that frequent the store.  Supposedly the mornings are hoppin with single people grabbing coffee so I guess you could mix it up with some young professionals on your way to work.   The prices for everything were reasonable. Both sandwiches were fresh and delicious. I'd return for another dinner maybe try some breakfast. They serve waffles and I love waffles.",

I always avoid the temptation of their amazingly wonderful looking morning eats and sweets, and I don't know how I continue to resist.   I get my Chai Tea Latte or my sugar with coffee and cream (just like Mike D.) and head into work. I love the vintage fun feel you get and the neighborhood environment is nifty.   I guess I need to expand and try one of their cooking classes or at least hang out and give the atmosphere a chance to sink in.  Though it doesn't have the drive through like the Starbucks I mentioned earlier, it does have a pretty fast moving coffee bar set up and barista. Even if I am running tight for work, I still take the time to park, get off my tush and walk into Luci's because it really does help brighten my day... and walking off with their cute blue and orange to go cup reminds you to smile as you walk into the office.",

One time we tried the baked goods and they tasted like they were sitting in that case for weeks! So nasty.

I tried a cappuccino and the foam was so thick I had to scope it out into the garbage can. The first 4 times we went the staff was rude, un-attentive and very unorganized.

Luci's is where I can go and make up my morning song about hot coffee, and rather than have the staff look at me funny, they freestyle right along with me. Luci's is where the name field on the order sticker doesn't say name, but rather says neighbor. Luci's is where I can get breakfast for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

The tater tots were pretty good, the burger was very well presented, but was a bit uncooked.  The funky monkey French toast was goddamned amazing! HUGE slices, extra thick. Definitely want that again!  Great atmosphere, great food. Only complaint was our food was quite staggered.",

If you are expecting actual, real turkey you will be disappointed to know it is just lunch meat. More processed, unhealthy food. I then ask for two pieces of lean bacon. It came out burned. I sent it back and the bacon was the same. I was told by the server that the cook assumed that lean and extremely crisp were one in the same. I will never go back.",

    "text": "Welllll, I had BIG expectations from this place! First off, any place with HEALTHY in their name is pretty much screaming at me to stop in. I had added Luci's Healthy Marketplace to my Instagram a while back, not sure how. Probably stumbled upon a picture of something that looked extremely tasty, followed by the name \"healthy\" and I'm there!!! So my first impression...I was handed my take out bag with clear, finger marks of grease on the outside, (which I will be posting a picture of!) Having taken a few nutrition classes, the term \"vegetarian\" \"vegan\" etc does NOT necessarily make it healthy! I understand organic and fresh local produce and can definitely appreciate that in my meal choice! I tasted just that in the vegetables although I was disappointed with what I ordered :/ I ordered the Veg Out Sammie. Usually, I see a long list of veggies and I'm all about it. Well that's basically what I ended up with. Raw veggies between 2 pieces of multigrain bread with a little bit of vegan mayo. No seasoning, spices, no sauce= NO FLAVOR! OK, I take that back...the roasted prepped was very flavorful! Haha, no skill for that! Just not impressed. When I'm paying about $10 for a sandwich i would expect something special about it. I have no limitation to my diet...not diabetic, no food allergies, not vegetarian. Therefore, I feel like I may as well have ordered something full of cheese and sauce and fat so there was flavor because I'm left completely dissatisfied! I enjoyed my dessert, a very, moist, salted dark chocolate caramel cookie (which came from an outsource!) So, what's for lunch?!",

I am glad to see that is pretty busy every time I stop in because it is a great little market.  I do find the selection a bit odd, but I always find a few things to take home with me.  I haven't found anything specifically earth shattering, but some unique and solid stuff.    I've enjoyed the super friendly service that I encounter every time I'm in and that they have an eclectic and fun menu.  I've tried the pumpkin spice latte, as well as the veggiesaurus melt.  The melt was just okay- I loved the mozzarella but the artichokes and peppers seemed a bit overwhelming.  Maybe throw in another veggie?  I also requested fruit instead of the potato salad and my strawberries were in pretty bad shape- they needed to be thrown out rather than served to me.    I'm sure that Luci's will be in my regular rotation since I drive by it so often.  I'm looking forward to trying out their themed dinners soon.",

The hubby had the special and between bites said it was good.  We thought the prices were a tad high even though delucious. We got to check out the grocery store portion and it is stocked full with natural, organic and gluten free foods.  Some novelties which were cute. Be warned - there are many urban hipsters about.",

Each time I've been its been a good time I will agree - that's more the company though.  They have some great items for sale - including rare gags (a bit pricey as appears all the produce/products in the store).  Parking is a problem during busy hours.  To the food... Its just been ok in regards to the breakfast food - understand I've kept to standard breakfast foods though (eggs, muffins, sausage, potatoes).  The potatoes were cold in the center this visit - so claims that they come out of a bag frozen are pretty much solidified for me.  Last visit my friend got a wrap and I had a bit of food envy.   Its a unique enough experience that I will go back, its a nice place to have a talk/drink when you can get a seat.  I'll try a wrap next time.",

Parking is easier in downtown Phoenix than here!  Located on the northwest corner of 16th St/Bethany Home. The spots are very tight and face one direction. So, you would want to be driving south along 16th street, then pull in for a better chance of finding a spot. Forget it!  I like to support small business, but any business owner should really consider the parking situation before finalizing the location of business.",

    "text": "I drive by Luci's so much and I finally got to try it last week. I wish I had popped into here sooner! Luci's is all things fresh with a tad of 'just in case' .. that would be the beer and wine in the cooler that they offer, or all the cool gifts, gadgets and even chocolates and candy to browse or buy in the marketplace that is sort of housed around the seating. The concept is simple. You order at the counter, grab your table with your number and they deliver your order a short while later. Luci's is hipster and cool and such a great place for a simple coffee or tea; freshly blended juice or smoothie;  a salad, sandwich, breakfast or like I said above, a  grab and sit beer or wine. The day that I was in, with my hiking mate, I somehow managed to beat the maniac lunch rush and got a high top table at the window. I ordered the ever fresh made to order, \" Chop Chop Cobb Salad, a light mix of spinach and seasonal squash, diced tomato, roasted turkey, applewood smoked bacon, red onion and marinated artichoke hearts. All topped with a home made bleu cheese pesto dressing. My daughter, ordered the Tuna Nicosia Salad. This salad was also fresh and yummy. It was made with fresh albacore tuna salad and served over mixed greens, with cucumber, tomato, a few green beans, a little hardboiled egg, red potato, red onion and olives and finished off with a light citrusy vinaigrette. Both of our salads were super filling and good! My salad was so loaded with bacon, I pulled some of it off! Luci's offers gluten free items on the menu, as well as ordering online, in case you are in a rush.. order before you go! I also noticed that Luci's serves breakfast all day and has a different special every day! Parking can be a mess here.. I will give that to where its located! So planning to dine here will take just that... some planning to beat the rush of morning or lunch. But albeit that, the service is happy, great and with a smile! The food is fresh, healthy and lovely. Since the food is so healthy, you can splurge on that other stuff!",

This little market makes me feel like I'm being transported to New Seasons or Powell's in Portland! *Happy Thoughts!*   I actually came to Luci's because I found out they carry my favorite brand of Kombucha (yes, Dr. Brew, also from Portland......obviously starting to see a pattern now [insert emoticon here]) But, when we arrived it was PACKED, people eating everywhere! It was Valentine's Day, so I suppose the rush might have been expected (or maybe that's just the norm for a Saturday?) Either way, these people looked like they were really enjoying their food, so, what's a girl to do? Join the bandwagon, of course!   I ordered the 'Luci's Famous All Natural Burger' (sans cheese). Yes. Yes, I can see why it's 'Famous'..... I mean, absolutely  DELISH.......SOOOO Juicy and flavorful.... in order to be a *perfect* burger, it just needed an ever so slight modification....yeah, that whole \"bun to burger ratio\" thing, this guy was SO Juicy that my bottom bun became sopped through with juices, meaning it fell apart! If that doesn't bother you, then you are at least in for a very delightful tasting experience! I would order again for sure (for this particular burger, I can live with the soggy bun). I also ordered the house salad with the lovely sounding citrus vinaigrette, but alas, my salad came out completely naked, so I didn't' get to taste it. They were far to busy to ask for a side of the dressing, so I'll just have to try it next time. (hence the docking of one star)  As per customer service, we met Neil, who is related to the owner. What a fantastic guy! Super friendly and helpful, I found out from him that I could actually buy a whole case of my beloved Kombucha and get an extra 10% off the case! PERFECT!!! Addiction is officially fed [big happy emoticon here] I believe they do this deal for various of your favorite beverages, not just the kombucha (I know not everyone is a fan, but boy they SHOULD be!)   The store itself has some of the regular things that health food stores offer, but they seem to be a little selective of what brands they choose to stock. I was very excited to find Maqui powder, something I keep checking for at Whole Foods and Sprouts, but usually to no avail. So, that was exciting. They also had a lot of cool odds and ends things - think Changing Hands meets Health Food Store - it makes for some fun browsing!",

    "text": "I absolutely love the location of Luci's, as it's just a walk from my apartment. I would love to give this eatery 4 stars, but it seems every time I stop in the prices go up. The food is good. I usually get the Spaniard omelet with a fresh orange juice. It's tasty, but nearby at Dick's Hideaway you can get a huge breakfast for not much more money. The retail store portion of Luci's is adorable and I love their random and weird finds! A great place for coffee and a snack!",

I did use a delivery service to order my food, but was pleasantly surprised that it showed up fresh and hot and ready to eat! My plain ol' breakfast burrito wasn't so plain after all! On a fresh tomato and basil tortilla, with seasonal potatoes, eggs, sausage and cheese, it melted in my mouth! It also came with a fresh side of salsa which was absolutely Devine. My bagel was customized with cream cheese and sausage, and it was delicious as well.   I have driven by Luci's every single day for over a year and never realized was a miss it was! I will defiantly be stopping by again soon! What wonderful food!",

I stopped in on my walk back to the car after dinner for and the idea seemed perfect. Guiltless cookies to satisfy the sweet tooth after dinner! I was in and out of Luci's really quick so I didn't get a chance to read whether or not the cookies were gluten-free, but I would bet my bottom buck that they were. They were super light and almost flakey and not too sugary. My favorite was the snicker doodle, which was closer on the continuum to a moist shortbread than to a sugar cookie. To me, the sea-salt double-chocolate cookie was a bit salty for my taste, but my fiance liked it. 2 gourmet cookies on the go for under $3 is a good deal!",

    "text": "Loving this place. Was like a smaller Wholefoods Market in regards to fresh cooked food station & additional prepackaged goods, kids items & organic hygiene & household products like Meyer's.   You order at the counter just inside the front entrance whether or not u are ordering sit-in or take-out. Menu is on the wall to the right. Cashier staff was quick & friendly. Then u take your # to your seat & either walk around to look for additional take home items or hang out for a very short wait for your food.   I had the Huevos Rancheros, which I ordered w/ my eggs scrambled - I have no desire to eat raw embryo. I also ordered a side of potatoes, which they call the Signature Seasoned Country Spuds. It's basically every type of potato, including sweet potato & excludes boring old russets. Lightly salted & some other seasoning, not oily or over cooked. Really tasty. Hubby had the Krabby Pants Omelette, which he admitted was quite a fitting description of his old geezer personality. See the detailed food descriptions on one of my attached pics or on the full website menu. I also had the fresh squeezed OJ, Hubby had lemonade. Neither had ice since they were nice & cold - both appreciated. Hubby also had the Double Chocolate Sea Salt Cookie. Hold on to your britches, but that was the item he like the most. Imagine that??  I really enjoyed the whole experience. Food was tasty, beautiful presentation, nice cafe atmosphere, no significant wait to order, friendly staff, clean restrooms & price reflected the overall quality. However, the drinks were a bit pricy when u consider the taste. Just ok.",

They haven't then tasted the OJ at essence bakery! That is True fresh squeezed pulp an all! ALSO the eggs Benedict were overcooked, still delicious, but overcooked.  Do recommend the French toast.",

We walk in and we see the sign, \"coffee bar\" so I thought we just order coffee and order food somewhere else. However, the girl before us started ordering food so I'm looking everywhere for a menu - look to the right, there it is! I spend some time on the menu - it's pretty extensive. The fiance and I decide on splitting the huevos rancheros and I got an iced vanilla latte with almond milk. We wait for our drinks - get a number and have a seat. I love the layout, but it can get a little confusing.  The vanilla latte was ok - not my favorite. The huevos rancheros was also meh. After eating, we start browsing the aisles. I like it - I normally eat paleo so it's nice to have this place near me in case I need any ingredients. Their spices are half off! I got excited - call me spice crazy. I wanted to get them all, but I knew I had most of them already.   Anywho, I'd probably come back. House wine bottles are $10 so that's a good deal!",

Well the dude taking our order wasn't exactly apologetic said something like I should have looked at their Facebook page well d*** I'm not the one who put you on azcentral maybe someone should have corrected them? Just a thought...? The link they had was NOT to your fb page... Trying to ruin my day... I think if he was even fake apologetic it would have been ok I suppose... And their peppermint latte is a hint of peppermint...   My food? COLD eggs, cold everything SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?  2 stars is for the knock knacks they have around  If I lived here and this was the service I got I would NOT return... Not worth it. I'm sure there are other healthy food places in Phoenix/Scottsdale area with better food and even better service... UGH  Posting the picture that made me come out here for absolutely NOTHING!",

This is the type of restaurant where you order your food and they bring it to the table. Since the line was long and I was waiting for my friend I sat a table to review the menu. When we finally did get in the queue to order we nearly lost our table as a gentleman grabbed the table we were sitting. I politely told him we were sitting there but he hadn't ordered either and was waiting for a friend. He ultimately conceded but he was rude. Not a good sign to have a minor argument with another patron before you even order food.  Once in the queue we waited over 10 minutes just to order. Just prior to the cashier there are all sorts of trinkets and things to purchase. I was utterly mortified when the first thing I saw was a plastic \"poop\"-type squeeze toy with the word \"POOP\" in big letters on the packaging.  Now I am a medical provider and am not the queasy type, but this is in such poor taste, I should have left right then.   I ordered an omelet and was just shocked that is had absolutely zero flavor. It was $13 dollars (with a cup of coffee) for omelet and potatoes. The potatoes were inconsistent and hot and cold in the same bite. And no flavor. Zero, zip, zilch. The service was fair and we sat in our coveted table for an hour after we finished eating and no one picked up our dirty dishes or even asked if we were done.  Would never recommend would never go back. And there is nothing very healthy about this place.",

The parking can be challenging, especially around lunchtime. I love the open roll top garage doors that they open when the weather is nice.",

There were no complaints at our table!   The only downfall were the flies that were constantly trying to get at our food because the restaurant keeps their garage style door open - so be prepared to swat at them!",

We've been here many, many times for breakfast - the pastries are yummy, the food is interesting and well-executed (the chef's special is always excellent), and the shop is fun to browse (a little spendy for actual buying, but great novelty items).   The pancakes are yummy, the crabby pants omelet is fabulous, and don't miss the breakfast potatoes! This past weekend, the Chef's special was a phenomenal Chilaquiles (we got a vegetarian version) - the roasted corn with chile lime butter was fantastic and the chef actually came out to see how we liked it (super nice guy!).  Overall, it's always a great experience eating at Luci's!",

This place can get very busy though and it can be hard to find a table. I would suggest going earlier in the morning or on a weekday. We ended up getting a table but felt a bit crowded. I love that this place has specialty groceries too. They have tons of cute knick knacks and everything you could need for your gluten free, paleo, non gmo, baking needs. Overall, super cute place with delicious food!",

The market portion carries great local and regional items and contains all sorts of sundries (produce, spices, dairy, hand cream and beer and wine). I always find something unique to take home for dinner.   My much loved breakfast is the burrito bomb  - scrambled eggs, chicken chorizo, sweet potatoes and cheese wrapped in a sundried tomato tortilla and served with spicy salsa. It is heaven.  There is a roll up garage door that is almost always open making the atmosphere very inviting. The coffee is strong and the service is top notch, this is my favorite spot for a quick breakfast!",

Gave the breakfast sandwich a try - interestingly; it was basically and omelet folded over and put between a bagel.  The flavor was good but the texture was much different than what you would expect from a traditional breakfast sandwich.  It was a fun place to checkout but probably wouldn't return back.",

My first time, I ordered a ham and provolone wrap with a tomato tortilla with a side of tater tots, a kale salad, and a sipp soda. -The wrap was delicious! It was fresh and flavorful! -I tried my mom's french toast and it was so good! I think it had cinnamon in it!  -Lastly, the kale salad would of been enjoyable but the kale was overly bitter and I felt bad, but I had to return it. I HATE returning stuff. The employees there were so nice about it though, thankfully.   On other occasions I had the turkey burger, the Madison Lavash, mimosa, and a caffe caramel. -The burger was good. Juicy and flavorful. -The flatbread was BOMB! Very crispy and full of flavor. You must try it!  -They were very generous on the mimosa if you know what I mean ;) and it was only $3! Winning! -The caffe caramel was good. Mellow and sweet just how I like it.   Unfortunately, they messed up my parents plates once, tried to fix it, and forgot the main ingredients again. It was a wreck. Lol  I will say that parking sucks but that must mean something of the businesses parking lot is full. I also like that they have a mini market inside! I would compare this place to La Grande Orange but a smaller place. I SMELL COMPETITION!",

I saw Frappe Chai (way cool), it gave you the option of regular milk or soy.Which is fantastic since me and dairy aren't the best of friends. For some reason I like to read for myself the option than asking someone, so seeing that I knew thats what I wanted. Iced Chai into a Frappicino...and with Soy?! - YES Please!  I was greeted fairly quickly, I had the option of 20oz or 32oz. I controlled myself and got the 20oz, cost $4.33. The board said 5 bucks, but who am I to correct the employee when its in my favor?! LOL, I'm sure it was some type of happy hour though.  During the transaction, the cashier stopped to pass on a message to another employee, apoligezed and finished up. I'm noting this only becuase the employee she talked to, walked out to the customers who were sitting at the tables. Asking if they want a to go box, wiping down counters, basically asking them how it was going. Waitress duties but without the restaruant, pretty nice!  I walked around while waiting, they had so many cute things!! The magnets were pretty funny, at 5bucks I might pick up a few next time. They had these really cute headbands, I picked up and put right back down when I say the price - $9.99. To much...for a headband atleast!! I didn't go to far into the Market, but stayed around the souviner type section.  Well waiting I got annoyed because a woman who walked in a minute behind me got her iced drink first. When I walked back to the counter, the employees back was to me, telling her coworker she made this twice. Turned around, smiled and handed my drink over, \"Frappe Chai with SOY.\" Emphasis on the soy. *Lightbulb* She had to remake my drink because she used regular milk. Annoyance gone! Thank you for realizing the mistake and fixing it! Not passing it off as soy. My tummy thanks you to!",

    "text": "Luci's is a great little healthy market in north central area of Phoenix.  We went for lunch one day during the week since they have a little cafe inside the market.  Service is kind of slow, but the food was good. The atmosphere is interesting since you sit pretty much in the market.  It's got a cute \"vintage/hipster\" look to it.  I love it but want to hate it at the same time. Does that make sense? Phoenix is fast becoming a \"Hipster-esk\" type of city, and this joint falls right in line with that feel.  I want to not like it, but i do...   ...Ok I'm rambling.  Check them out, the food is good.",

    "text": "Luci's tends to be my go-to place to when I have some take-home work or need a place to study.  They have free wi-fi and an atmosphere conducive to work, study, or even have a leisurely read.      They have good coffee, great iced tea, and delicious pastries.  I am partial to the scones and brownies.  I have only ordered the turkey burger off the menu.  It has a Mediterranean flair, was garnished with red peppers and artichoke hearts, and complimented with a side of regular and sweet potato tater tots.  It was an excellent sandwich, especially when compared to many of the outstanding restaurants in the area.   The service is what makes Luci's shine.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  A manager usually asks about your food and won't hesitate to refill your iced tea.  Notwithstanding, I did have one negative experience with the service.  They forgot to make a coffee that I ordered.  After complaining, they apologized, quickly made my drink, and even gave me a $5,00 gift card for the inconvenience.  To their credit, they went above and beyond, which is more than what most places would do.  Luci's also has a market attached to the restaurant/coffee shop.  They have a small but quality selection of wines, beers, cheeses, prepared foods, and a variety of other items.    Luci's is a great place to study/work, grab a quick bite, or have a casual date.  You should definitely check it out if you're in the area.",

Waiting by the kitchen area to grab a menu, the grill was a freakin mess! We almost left right then. The manager? guy was kind of pestering the chef? to get this next order right. The chef guy seemed very disinterested in listening to him. Kind of weird.   Food order was wrong. They offered to remake it which was fine. Then the order came back out and they were out of chips this time, so I had to choose a different side.   Cramped interior. Had to squeeze between tables to the side of the garage door to some baskets mounted to the wall to get plasticware. Just not what I was expecting. Kind of amateurish feeling.

My friend got a green tea smoothie and she couldn't finish it saying it was disgusting, I tasted it and agreed. She ordered the three egg breakfast. How could you go wrong with that? Our order came to our table, again very disappointing. Over cooked eggs, wet barely warmed deli ham, not ham steak, and not even browned on the flat top. Toast wasn't even toast, it was barely warmed bread. The potato medley was hardly cooked with no flavor, no seasoning and no caramelization crunchy goodness. I mean seriously, how can you show no love to an innocent potato. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which sucked! It was an over cooked bacon omelet with barely any cheese on an English muffin that wasn't even toasted. Really?!? They weren't really even that busy considering it was a Sunday breakfast rush. It's like their Chef could care less about the food he/she puts out. Worst thing of all my friend calls me 20 minutes later telling me she threw her breakfast up on the way home, poor thing. Now that's saying something about their food! Stay away my friends, steer clear of Lucie's by all means necessary.",

    "text": "Luci's is a cute marketplace located in the epicenter of what is quickly becoming the hottest area in the 602 for locally owned outstanding businesses.  My first experience with Luci's was after having dinner at The Garage, my pal I and wanted to grab a coffee. We went in at about 9:30, and I was surprised to find two Debbie Downers working the counter. I tried to make a small joke, to see if these were people, or if the zombie uprising was starting, but I am still uncertain.  Grabbed a coffee and cupcake and called it a night. The coffee was good and the cups were pretty cool, they had a built in heat sleeve, so you are wasting less paper. The cupcake was ok, but nothing to start a Facebook fan page over.  Second visit was again after a visit to The Garage (hey, I am a simple creature) this time on a Friday at lunch. Happily, I had a complete different experience, and the staff were downright sweet. There were five people in my group, and I was ordering/paying for us all. After ordering two drips, and a mocha, the girl happily expressed, \"Oh, I thought this was going to be a much more difficult order.\" It was kind of silly and sweet, almost like she meant to think that, and not say it, but her intentions were good, so I just told her we like to keep things simple. Walking over to prepare my coffee, another employee warmly greeted us and asked what we were up to today. It was a nice exchange, and it was great reflection on the place. I will chalk up my first experience to people being tired, I think we've all had days like that and no harm done.",

It looked so cute with the garage door open and looked full of activity. They had a little farmers market in front with fresh produce from a local farm being sold.   I had a soy latte , my husband had a vanilla latte and we split the egg sammie. The lattes were really good and I agree the corrugated cups are way better than those \"sleeves\" you get at other coffee places. The egg sammie was really big, it looked more like an omelet squished between a bagel.   The total for everything was $14 which seemed a little high but you can tell everything was made with quality ingredients so the price is worth it. The lunch menu sounds great and consists of mostly sandwiches and salads. This is a fun place to meet with friends or just stop in for a good cup of coffee.",

BLACK? Check. LARGE? What the hell is this puny little bastard? FRENCH VANILLA? There were no pumps of anything in there.   Your coffee is the best. At least to me. But when I'm thinking about waking up and getting it the night before and the morning comes and I'm totally disappointed, it's such a challenge to pull myself from this mood.   Did you hear that Starbucks just implemented a rule that the baristas can't make more than two drinks at once? It's because we're only human and we fuck shit up. Sure, there was a line, but it wasn't out the door. Just relax and listen to the order. Repeat it back. Only work on, at max, two things at once.   I would have just said something but I knew I would be rude and I didn't want to be mean so I just kept my mouth shut.   Anyway, I read some of your others reviews and I don't think a lot of people are being fair. For the space, I think your choices for healthy foods are inspired. They are the right combination of appeal to the masses and appeal to the hippies.   All I want is a really big coffee. 32 fluid ounces. Please. It's important that it's right.

My kale salad was $11.99 - along with tea and a side of tots my lunch was $20.56. Bit expensive for a non- restaurant coffee shop... ? Unless there is an identity crises. I like the local items such as the wine and health food, but again I seldom purchase because it's too much. And, I ALWAYS buy local - this place is more than reasonable. Other than that - it's fine. Good food, not always so flavorful ( my kale salad was lovely but the chicken was hard and there was no dressing - not even a light oil or a lemon juice something...). Teas are very good and coffee is fine.  I eat out often and would come here more if food was less for what it is...and I do love the open doors.
