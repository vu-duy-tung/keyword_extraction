    "text": "Muy delicioso! Taking up residence where JB's Restaurant used to be years and years ago, I was very excited to see that Los Reyes de la Torta would be expanding to Tempe! This restaurant serves up Mexico City cuisine, with various meaty options, some seafood (Shrimp) dishes, and a few vegetarian meals. We ventured in today, and were greeted with the buzz and bustle of a hectic opening week.   The interior is quite spacious, with warm, sunny colors and decor. There were a few people waiting in the front area for to-go orders, but we were seated promptly for sit-down service. Being my first time at a Los Reyes de la Torta location, I had to go with the Man vs. Food, Adam Richmond special: The famous Torta Del Rey ($9.50). I also tried some of the carne asada tacos.   We were served chips and salsa to start with. The salsa was thin, with good flavor and spicy heat. The torta was served sliced in half, with a large serving of crinkle-cut potato chips. It was a tall tower of meat, cheese, egg, and vegetables. When eating it, I was reminded of Adam Richmond's assessment of this sandwich on his \"Best Sandwich in America\" show. When you bite into the sandwich, you taste different layers of flavor and different temperature combinations depending on which section you bite into first (The sandwich is so big it's very hard to actually bite into all the layers at one time). The lower layer consists of a smattering of slow cooked beans and the roasted and breaded meats- the tastiest layer in my opinion! The middle section holds the cheese, scrambled egg, chorizo, and cured meats (Ham and hot dog). While I liked the ham and chorizo in the sandwich, the hot dog tended to overpower the other meats in the torta. The upper layer was the \"cool\" layer, consisting of sliced avocado and tomato. I enjoyed the combination of cool vegetables with grilled meat. However, I would have liked more of the cool ingredients to balance out all the hot ingredients. The torta itself was nicely grilled, with delicious telera bread.  The carne asada tacos were like street tacos. They had a good amount of chopped meat, cilantro, and onion on it, with some lime wedges to add more citrus flavor.  For beverages, they have a wide array of drinks to choose from (All non-alcoholic). I tried the horchata ($4), which was a little watery, but tasted freshly made and was pretty refreshing overall.  While I'm glad I tried the Torta Del Rey, it's a hefty meal. I'd definitely be interested in trying out more items from this restaurant!",

It took about an hour before we were able to order our food after being seated, My friend ordered a margarita and they failed to tell us that they did not have their liquor license yet and it was going to be a virgin margarita. I ordered their asada burrito with red sauce on top and it was horrible. There was barely any meat but a lot of fat and chewy pieces inside. I can honestly say that I've had a better asada burrito at Filiberto's. Our waiter was young but nice. I probably won't come back.",

I really liked. The tortas are huge here!!   I don't know is they brought me out 2 tacos by accident or not, but they said I could just have then as a \"regalo \".

Ingredients were distributed throughout the burrito and not just clumped on there.  Nothing worse than taking a bite of your burrito and getting a mouthful of just guacamole! And none in the rest.  Yuck.  Not here, they know how to fix it right.  If I had to make a criticism, it would be the tough tortilla.  It was kind of difficult to cut-- but to their credit, they did provide a knife.  If you pick it up and eat it, stuff might squirt out and go everywhere when you bite through it.  I also enjoyed my husband's carne asada taco (I stole one off his plate).  Plenty of lime and yummy caramelized onion on the side.  Its worth a visit for sure.",

    "text": "Delicious tortas, quick and friendly service, nice and clean location.  I'm holding on to the 5th star for now until I try more of the tortas. I may even have to dig into that Carlos V at some point if I work up a serious appetite one of these days. But this was quite a first experience and is easily a 4-star restaurant for me.  I came alone and was immediately seated. I was brought a basket of chips (kinda stale, not the greatest chips anyway) and salsa (nice and spicy, good flavor) to enjoy while I looked at the menu and waited for my entree.  The menu is extensive! There are a ton of different tortas to order (although I must admit that some of them seemed to be rather redundant), and there are other, non-tortas options as well. But with how delicious the tortas are, I'm not sure that I'll ever move on to the other options.  I ended up ordering El Principe with grilled chicken. It came out pretty quickly, and it was nice and hot. It was served with a small salad of lettuce, radishes, cucumbers, a charred chunk of onion, and a delicious broiled pepper. I dug into the salad and added some of the extra green salsa they brought with my sandwich. Then I dug into the sandwich. It was downright messy--grilled onions and chicken were falling all over my hands and plate. I added some salsa to several of the bites for some extra flavor, but it didn't need it. The chicken was nice and tender, the onions were soft and nicely charred, and the cheese, guacamole, and sauce all made for a great combination. The bolillo was very soft and tasty. All in all, this was an excellent sandwich!  The service was great throughout. I was acknowledged immediately when I walked in the door, even though the hostess had just left to seat somebody else. A guy in the kitchen saw me through the kitchen window and told me that somebody would be right with me. My server was very attentive and friendly as well.  I'll definitely be back, and if a few of the other tortas match this first one, I'll end up bumping my rating up to 5 stars.",

The ham is sliced thick.  The breaded beef has a spicy kick to it.  The omelet (and yes... let's just call it an omelet) somehow makes it all come together.  And keep napkins nearby before you start because all the avocado and sauce and beans will get all over the place.  The tortas - I usually go with the Del Rey or the Reyna , just for the kitchen sink level variety of stuff they shove it.  Is it breakfast?  Is it lunch?  Is it dinner?  Yes!  All the tortas come with a more than generous side of Ruffles.  A few times when I've ordered a torta takeout, it's felt like they handed me a lunch sack with half a Costco-sized bag of them.  Service was solid and friendly although it's always been pretty busy every time I've been here.  Wait times go by fast though.  And now, I can't wait for my next visit.",

How can you go wrong with an egg on top of breaded beef, with a handful of other delicious ingredients thrown in? I don't think I would venture out to eat anything but their tortas.   The service is pretty prompt. I never had an empty glass, or an empty chip bowl. Speaking of chips, they are pretty good. A little saltier than I'm used to, but still good enough to have an empty bowl by the time the food comes. The salsa could be better... I don't know how to explain the salsa other than really bland. It's not always this way, but this visit was definitely a miss.   I also like their Strawberry milkshake. It's served in a large goblet looking cup, for almost $5 the price is just right. I could just have that as a meal. Check out their desserts and large drink selection (fresh fruit drinks).   Come eat some tortas! It is also good enough to be on food network (Man Vs Food - even though I dislike this show they advertise it, and Diners, drive ins and dives).",

    "text": "I can't believe all the nay-sayers I see posting here.  So I had to update my review to answer a few \"disputes\" listed by the rather clueless individuals posting hereto.  1.)  Their Carne Asada is made from TOP SIRLOIN.  NO RESTAURANT in the WORLD (except Los Reyes) makes their Carne Asada from top sirloin.  So for those who say that their meat is \"garbage\" or \"old\"--think again.  2.)  Frozen rice?  Everything here is hand-made.  Not reconstituted.  They don't have \"frozen rice.\"  3.)  Crappy frijoles?  These are made from scratch.  If you think they aren't \"up to par\" with other AZ offerings . . . I know FIRST HAND that most of the \"Mexican\" restaurants here in the Valley reconstitute their \"frijoles\" from a powdered mix with boiling water.  If you prefer the taste of that crap . . . then, of course, you have no clue as to how real frijoles are prepared en Mexico.  Much like people who turn their noses up at Prime Rib because it doesn't taste like a McDonald's hamburger.  4.)  This is real-deal cooking from D.F.  If you don't know what that means, you probably need to do a little traveling.  If it doesn't match the \"Tex-Mex\" or burrito/chimichanga fare you are used to (PS:  neither of those are Mexican dishes--they were invented in El Paso, TX, USA around 1912) then don't decry them based on your lack of experience.  Try actually going to Southern Mexico--ask for a Burrito and they'll laugh in your face; ask for a chimichanga and they'll look at you in confusion.  Most Mexican nationals have NEVER SEEN A BURRITO UNLESS THEY HAVE VACATIONED IN THE UNITED STATES.  Mexico's regional cooking is very diverse . . . much like you won't see a Hot Brown outside of Kentucky or Mud Pie outside of Mississippi, but they are BOTH American dishes.  So don't judge if you don't know.  5.)  Not spicy enough, therefore not authentic?  That's how it is in most mainstream D.F. restaurants.  The \"heat\" that people search out here in the SW USA and then \"credit\" to Mexico is actually not how it is in real life.  And, believe me, I actually do know this from experience, having traveled most of Central & Southern Mexico on the economy, NOT on resort tours.  If you don't like the food . . . well that's certainly your prerogative.  But don't decry LRDLT's efforts and expertise based on your complete lack of knowledge/experience of REAL Mexican cuisine.  And don't compare them to Tex-Mex or \"gringo-ized\" offerings you get here in the US.",

The ham slice which is on almost every torta is a slice of pressed ham pieces that could have come out of a can.  The breaded beef is a wafer thin slice of beef encrusted in soggy breading.  And the roll is shaped like a bolillo but is soft and crustless, although it is grilled to give it a bit of crisp.  It's not horrible, but it's not tasty either.    They could do a lot better.",

The taco consistency went down. It got sloppier and the seasoning or amount of seasoning suddenly changed.   The tres leches cake on the other hand is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT cake. I loved going there simply for that cake. I didn't mind paying $5+tax for it. The new cake is cloyingly sweet, has some jelly in between the cake layers. Then  they decided to put walnuts on top of the cake. Good lord it's gross. I dunno if the walnuts were bad, but I'm done with this place. I'll find somewhere else to get my tres leches cake.",

Unfortunately like a lot of other reviewers I found the service to be sub par.  The waitress did not know many very basic questions about the menu.  I'm OK with a learning curve with this being a new restaurant but everything I asked she had to go ask someone else about.  It didn't seem she knew much about the menu.  I also felt their was a language gap as her English phrasing came across harsh and rude.  If I knew Spanish I feel the entire experience might have been better.  The food came in a reasonable amount of time and everyone enjoyed their meal.  The price was very reasonable.  Overall my only complaint was the service but I'll give them some time to iron out the service and I will come back again.",

The problem with it was that it was all bread with very little filling, but I still loved the flavors.  The place is pretty big with not much crowd. I hope they make it. They would probably have been better off in a smaller establishment.",

While my stomach wasn't ready for the infamous torta, I tried a meat combo plate.  What were labeled as \"sausages\" were sliced hot dogs, and the ham was essentially thin sandwich meat heated on a grill.  On a positive note, the guacamole and salsas are delicious and worth trying which gives the extra star.  I plan on going back to the restaurant to try the Torta del Rey and hopefully increase the rating.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this restaurant. The old J.B.'s building had been unoccupied for years and I was excited to see a new restaurant going in, particularly one that didn't seem to be part of a mega-chain, 'cause, really, how many Applebee's and Outbacks and Joe's Crab Shacks do we need within a ten-square-mile radius of my home? A few weeks after the \"grand opening\" traffic died down, I popped in with my boyfriend and my mother for a quick lunch.  We won't be back.  The service was dreadful, from the hostess who rolled her eyes and said, \"Come on\" as she grabbed menus and headed to a table (Really? What happened to \"Right this way\" or \"Follow me, please\") to the completely nonverbal waitress who seemed unable to do anything but point and grunt. She did her job, but it was very perfunctory. She did not say ONE word to us the entire hour or so we were there. She would bring the water pitcher to our table, lift it, and go \"Unuh?\" What? We are bilingual, and also tried to communicate in Spanish to no avail, so at some point we just quit trying. (It did occur to me that maybe she had laryngitis, or was mentally challenged or something, but in my experience, in those cases, the hostess or manager will take 20 seconds to let you know, so I think she was just a very inexperienced server or a horrifically rude person.)  Very stale chips, bland salsa that was obviously on the cusp of going \"off\"...you know that weird overripe tomato taste. It was the first time I've EVER been in a Mexican restaurant and not polished off at least one serving of chips and salsa.   I understand the fare here is supposed to be \"Mexico City\" or \"Central Mexico\" or whatever but the food was just not to my liking. There were few vegetarian options, and with a waitress who couldn't talk, I was unable to ask my usual (very few and very polite) questions about whether or not the chips were fried in lard, or if the sauce was made with chicken stock. I settled on a \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy and ordered some sort of veggie burrito. Nothing to write home about, but edible. The onions were cooked nicely. My mother, also a vegetarian, got stuck eating the same thing. There are some \"you can order mushrooms instead of meat\" dealies, but with no way to figure out how they were prepared, I didn't want to go that route, and neither did my mother. My boyfriend ordered some sort of meat taco nonsense which he did not enjoy and did not finish. He said the meat was underseasoned and overcooked.  The dessert menu looked interesting, so we decided to split some sort of chocolate flan cake thingy. It was yummy, but obviously a frozen product.   Bottom line...if you're stuck there with some work friends, you can probably find something mildly edible. If you're into this \"style\" of cooking (I'm not sure that authentic Central Mexican cuisine consists of stale chips, rotting salsa, and burned meat, but okay) you'll probably enjoy Los Reyes. If you want to have a really good meal with super-friendly service, drive a little further (or flip a U-ey) and hit up Sahara on the NE corner of McClintock and Southern.",

This is made with a huge and thick corn tortilla, filled with meat and sauce, topped with more sauce and crema and it's very tasty. We took half of it home for lunch the next day.  It cost only $5.50.  Our son had the Torta Norteno.  We learned that Tortas are basically sandwiches served on Hogie type bun.  The bun is very tasty. The grandson had the Torta del Rey which has a crazy list of things in it like ham, pork sirloin, beef, an omelet---and on and on.  These sandwiches are so big that half of them went home for the next day. We ordered the Tres Leches cake for dessert.  The presentation on that rivaled any fancy place you might eat at.  And it was delicious! The service was excellent.  If only all restaurants had this quality of service.      They serve only non-alcoholic beverages but they have Margaritas and Pina Coladas.  You just have to bring your own bottle.        When you walk in you will see TV monitors on Spanish speaking channels and hear lots of Spanish but don't be put off by this, our waitress spoke perfect English.     We'll go there again soon.",

    "text": "Ok so before I moved to Tempe I had seen this place on the ever so awesome show Man Vs Food as well as America's best sandwiches. Of course I had to go here and try it right?! When we sat down and got the menu I saw that this place was more than just Tortas (Mexican style sandwiches). They had a very extensive menu. Oh man what the heck was I going to order with so many choices. I'm not a decisive person so when i get a huge menu it makes it really hard on me. Ugghhh! But wait this place has Torta in their name and every time I had seen them on TV it was a Torta the foodie celeb was eating so that was what I would order as well! I wasnt about to try the Man vs Food Torta called the Torta King Carlos V priced at over $20, but this is because it can feed a small village. Nope not for me. I would instead choose the other sandwich which came out in America's best sandwich list...the Torta Del Rey. The sandwich consisted of the following: Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, omelet, sausage and Mexican sausage come with tomato, onions, avocado, chipotle sauce, smear of refried beans and potatoes ruffles on the side. That sounds like a lot yumminess in between 2 pieces of bread. Wait how do they even fit all of that in a sandwich? They're joking right...Not at all! This thing is huge and just under $10...oh my! Whoever thought of this is a genius cause it tasted amazing! The only downfall is the thing is huge and hard to keep together. Gets quite messy for sure, but the experience is pleasurable throughout. Last of all the service was incredible. The host and waitresses would promptly come around frequently always making sure we were content. I would definitely return here and suggest anyone else do the same...just make sure you are feeling hungry!",

The inside is very Mexican like. A lot of good Mexican music being played as well as the decor. The menu had a variety of things to choose from. How can you come to a torta place and not order a torta??? I ordered El Principe. It came with beans, pico de gallo, salsa, Mexican cheese, choice of meat (beef) jalapenos and some lettuce. It was really good!! Everything from the flavor to the portion size was on point. This place was definitely a highlight of my day. I would recommend coming especially since the guy from Man vs Food came here in 2012. Check it out!! You won't be disappointed.",

To me it doesn't matter if you have delicious food, if I'm still a kind of hungry when I leave. Overall pretty underwhelmed.",

The cushions were Naugahyde and the table tops were clean but with a thin film of stickiness. Probably grease. Loved it. Nice, pleasant, unpretentious surroundings and people. Hope you're hungry. Big big portions that should satisfy the biggest eaters. Not expensive. Large menu. Bewildering if you don't know Mexican cuisine. Authentic. I've never tasted prickly pear before. Lots of cheeses in our meals so watch out lactose intolerants. Interesting flavors and textures. Will definitely come back when I want to feel like I'm briefly visiting Mexico for a meal.",

Here they don't have those issues as the building is very large and open.   The food is great, not as good as I remember the same food being at the other location but I wasn't as hungry this time either so it may have just been me.   This place gave us tortilla chips and hot sauce when we sat down. I jokingly asked my wife where the potato chips were like we had at the other location. Later when I got my torta I got my potato chips and laughed about it. The guacamole was good but spicy. Most other places don't have spicy guacamole. So remember if the hot sauce is too hot eating guacamole to cool down your mouth will just make it worse.   The place wasn't very busy and the waitress was very nice and attentive. The food came quickly and you could tell was freshly made. I'll be back as this location is much closer to work and home.",

Our waitress Alondra was very quick kind and professional. Every few minutes she constantly asked if we needed anything and that to us is very important. I enjoyed the cheese enchiladas with rice and had to order beans on the side.  It was prepared differently than most mexican food places. It had mozzarella cheese inside on top it had lettice, avocado, mexican cheese and sour cream topped with home made  green verde salsa. I can tell it wasn't a frozen food its authentic.  They also have a very large selection of natural fruit drinks check out my photos of what drinks they have. Especially if your pregnant they have alot of delicious healthy drinks. Im definitely coming back to this place love the great customer service and how they make the food makes me wonder if this is how  people in Mexico prepare their food because its slightly different than filibertos, ponchos and so on. The restaurant is very clean and  nice.",

I look around and see a neon \"Open\" sign glowing from across the parking lot. The sign on the door says they open at 10am, so I hustle in and am immediately seated in a booth.   A basket of tortilla chips and a small bowl of salsa instantly appear and a smiling waitress takes my order promptly. I order a small chicken torta (less than $6). The chips were odd. Some tasted stale and like unsalted Fritos. Others tasted like over salted fresh tortilla shells. The salsa was watery and not to my taste. I can't quite put my finger on what was missing in it, but it tasted like tomato juice.   My torta arrived steaming hot with a side of potato chips. It seemed like carb overkill--tortilla chips, potato chips, and the bread in the sandwich. That said, I loved the toasted roll and the chicken. The tomato on the sandwich was pale with no taste.   The decor here is strange. I know that they have tried to turn an old JBs into a Mexican vibe eating place, but the painted walls were really bugging me. About half way through my sandwich I figured it out. They tried to make the walls in the dining area look like they had been stuccoed, but instead it looks like a bunch of 3 year olds had finger painted the wall with poo. Yech. Two walls had flat screen TVs on them, but with no volume and on different stations. Just as they were bringing my sandwich, someone switched on some Mexican polka music so loud that it startled me.   Would I eat here again. Probably not. If someone was just craving a torta would I mention this place? Yes, but only because I don't know of many torta places nearby.",

On my second visit, the service was a bit slower. When I asked if I could replace the potato chips with my torta for beans and rice I was told that it could not be done. Kind of a bummer but not a deterrent. The servers are nice. I like the back ground music because It reminds me of the times I have visited my family in Mexico City.",

This place is walking distance from my apartment and I've been hearing how tasty it  is for a while. My boyfriend and I finally decided to go last week. We were served tortilla chips and fresh salsa when we arrived and I ordered a watermelon agua fresca. It came out quickly and was so delicious. It's a perfect refreshing drink for a hot summer day.  I ordered the nortena de pollo and it was awesome! The bread is warm, light, soft with a light crunch. The chicken, cheese, and toppings were great! I loved it!  My boyfriend ordered the del principe with steak. It has basically the same ingredients as the nortena de pollo but with a thick slice of cold Mexican cheese. He wasn't a huge fan of the cold cheese on the warm torta, but I thought it was tasty. For newbies to authentic Mexican food, just realize the Mexican cheese will be a cold thick slice and the melted cheese is obviously warm and melted.   We definitely plan on coming back and trying more tortas. Check this place out",

I ordered the princess and think its called that cause its a bit more dainty than some of the other selections.  It was amazing.  I normally cannot finish a whole sandwich but it was so good, I could not stop eating it.  One of those oh, one more bite scenarios and felt like they had to roll me outta there.

Both our meals were cold and I took a bite of mine and it was steak instead of chicken and grisly steak at that. I waited for our waitress to come over and when she didn't I ate the rice. The waitress finally came over and my husband said his meal was cold and i explained I ordered chicken which she said I hadn't.  Explained I didn't want the steak and sent it back. She did offer to get me something else but at this point I was more dumbfounded by the lack of initiative to replace my husbands cold meal and my incorrect one. When the bill came my husband saw my meal was still on it and he asked why she didn't remove mine and she just looked at us. This was very disappointing and I just wanted to leave.",

The menu has tortas, lots of appetizers and colorful drinks. I ordered a horchata that came out in a HUGE goblet. Our friends pina Colada had a umbrella in the drink like it was his bday!  I enjoyed the shrimp appetizer it was really fresh! It was a small bite the only gripe is I wish I could have more!   Our large torta sandwich came and we shared. Guys with big appetites will enjoy this this place because they are very generous with portion sizes.  We'll be back for sure!",

It was beautifully presented, the bolillo bread was very fresh it was all good, so much so I had to take the rest home. Good for kids and first dates, especially if you like the local music as ambiance, I found myself dancing a bit while seated in my booth, but the waitataff didn't mind",

    "text": "You know we moved to AZ a little over a year. Adjusting to a different climate, culture, and food ethnicity I had to really adapt and reset my mindset of how to eat out and learn to try Mexican dishes, since it's all over the place here. Being born and raise in Hawaii we don't have much Mexican places and if we do, it's not the best or it seemed like it wasn't anything fascinating, maybe the margaritas was more tastier because we had our lihing mui margaritas which is da bomb over tequila margaritas!  Coming to this homely restaurant is changing my concept of thinking it's not so bad, in fact it has much more flavors on each bite.  Stepping into the restaurant, although we do not speak the language, I love how they greet us and they know we sorta understand what they are saying! The hostess to our waitress, which we had her twice, have the pleasant hospitality. It does take us awhile to figure out what we wanna eat because the only dishes we are familiar with is \"Enchiladas, burritos, guacamole dip, and a few of their tacos\" lol... our waitress, she is patient with us as decide!  I love how their are so many Mexicans flock as families to come in and sit around the table Celebrating birthdays and etc. I love how they all greet each other with a hug/kiss before they sit down and here laughter in the air! I miss this sooo much because it reminds me of how our culture back home does the same. The restaurant has good vibes, good energy, laughter and the food is outstanding!  I've been too a few Mexican places and I have a hard to acquiring the taste because I'm unsure or haven't really found anything that I can be drawn too to enjoy!  But, for this place - I am enjoying very much of their atmosphere, I love how our waitress, she remembers us from our first visit & my husband loves the food and so do I. For me to say this is a shocker because I'm not accustom to it!  But, tonight having dinner and just being in the midst of families made it even more special to enjoy the surroundings, their culture, and their amazing dishes... on the other hand, I still have a hard time drinking water from the cup, I have to ask for lots of lemon to kill the pipe water taste!  Friendly, family restaurant, good vibes & now I have kanak attack ...",

We were sat pretty quickly although the hostess was m.i.a. for 5 minutes or so.   The menu is HUGE and a little daunting if you don't know what some of the items are. I started out with the chaquito ceviche which was really good and the perfect size. We ordered the pancho via torta and both the Carne asada and pork belly tacos. The full size torta is insanely large, honestly big enough for two people. The Carne asada tacos were very very good, not dry like most places.  The pork belly was decent but lacked in flavor.  Overall the food was a hit, and once the waitress took the order, the food came out quickly.  The kitchen was very efficient.  The downfall of this place is the service. Slow is an understatement and I think it's because they are very understaffed.  Everyone was friendly but water refills rarely occurred and when it was time for the check, the waitress disappeared for 15 minutes!    Bottom line, if you're not in a hurry and willing to sacrifice service for good food, you've got the spot.",

This restaurant advertises it's Mexico City style food, so we were particularly excited. We came in and were promptly greeted, and noticed it was pretty full. Like the name suggests, they have a wide selection of tortas! My brother ordered the Del Rey, which they mentioned is the most popular. He loved it, my dad loved it, and everyone was happy. The menu is pretty large and you'll have a lot to choose from, and includes some tried and True favorites- like the quesadilla. Our food came out maybe ten minutes after we ordered it. So fast!! My dad commented on how authentic the food was, and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. I'll definitely be back. If you want good Mexican, skip the chains and come here!",

The service is prompt but they allow you to just chill if that's what you need.   The large corn tortillas are a house specialty and make a full meal with things like asada or chorizo. The red chicken enchiladas are a deal and very filling. The chips and salsa taste great and you get all you want.  The staff is friendly and prompt to take care of you. It's a team. Even the manager checks in with you regularly. I highly recommend this place.",

The waiter who gave us our chips and salsa pointed out which was  spicy and which was normal, although upon tasting them the normal was spicier than the supposed \"spicy\" which was not hot at all. It took 30 minutes to receive our food after ordering. Our waitress, although not expressly rude, had a very cold and uninviting demeanor.   However, the food was fantastic. I hope they can work on bettering their service because they do have potential to be a successful restaurant.",

I ordered the Cubana Torta with ham, pork sirloin, avocado, onions and peppers.  They offer quite a large number of tortas in a couple of sizes.  Plus Burros, Tacos, Quesadillas and some Seafood dishes.  The pork sirloin was well seasoned and sliced thin so it was very tender and complimented the ham.  Overall, the sandwich was tasty and filling.  The torta came with ruffles potato chips right out of the bag which seemed kind of odd.  Some type of \"Mexico City\" side dish would seem to be more appropriate.  Overall, very satisfied with the service and food.  I'll be back soon to try another Mexican sandwich.",

I just thought to myself thats all you could do was offer us water??? It would be one thing if we were there to sit down and eat and had no time crunch to get food.  We are used to getting huge orders from taquitos jaliscos in like 30 min or less.  I didnt get any kind of apologies or anything from the managers walking around. Can we say unprofessional?    So our second visit my BIRTHDAY.  We had a waitress with so much attitude she could make a room feel tense.  I will never return to this place after the stupid B****es wanted to eye down my mom like we had to be rushed out the door to leave just because the waitress' shift was over with. To top it off they didn't do anything like bring a dessert for my bday or anything. Not like that's the reason for my visit all I want is good food a decent enough service. If you can't provide both or 1.5 of those things bring me a dessert NAO!  I will stick to going to the phoenix location from now on.  Tempe location I hope you go out of business because of the horrendous service. It makes me so disgusted.",

Chips were stale and the salsa wasn't appreciably better.  Ordered a diet coke and tea.  In short YUCK!!  Tea went back in favor of another diet coke.  Next we ordered...2 tortas...Ranchera de pollo o res (with steak) and a Carne Asada.  As I figured out later I got the wrong sandwich (mine should have had chips but didn't) but at the end both sandwiches were the same albeit what should have been mine had cucumbers, radishes, etc vice chips.  So a couple of observations...every other Carne Asada torta I've ever had came with chopped meat vice strips (quite wide strips).  Moreover, it this is how they do it then other the sides, and as mentioned already, there was NO FRIGGIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SANDWICHES...WTF!!!!!!  As for the sandwiches themselves...YUCK!!!  There are far too many places to get a far superior torta in the Valley.  In short, I should have gone to Taco Bell.",

Within a few minutes of my sitting down, I was greeted by my waiter, provided with what I think were homemade chips and two different salsas, as well as 3 different menus. The first menu was the lunch special menu, the second menu was an assortment of drinks on one side and desserts on the other side, and the third menu was their regular menu.  The waiter was prepared for me to take my time ordering, but I opted to order immediately, asking for an item that was not on the menu. I ordered a Lengua Burrito enchilada style with green chili on it. My waiter didn't bat an eye, but did compliment me on my Spanish! LOL.   I started in on the chips, and found them to be delicious, as were both of the salsas. While both exhibited some heat, one was definitely a bit hotter than the other, though both had excellent flavor and body. None of that thin, watery stuff here.  In short order, my burrito arrived. Large, soft, and swimming in a pool of green chili with a little crema squirted over it. It was so good I emptied my entire plate. I also ordered a Tostada de Ceviche in the appetizer size just to try it. As with the burrito, it too was excellent and a nice size just to try it.  Of interest is that the menu contains proteins that are not usually found in most Mexican/American restaurants, including Lengua (tongue), Buche (pork belly), Cabeza (beef head), and Pierna (pork sirloin). I found that the way the menu was designed, every dish was listed both with a full English description as well as a Spanish description.   The only think I did not care for was the televisions all tuned to a different Spanish language station. They took away from the atmosphere, which would have been a lot nicer had there been some good mariachi music in the background instead.  The place was spotlessly clean, and service was excellent. I hope they continue to keep up this level of food and service, because this is one of the very best Mexican style restaurants I have eaten in in this state.  4 stars for excellent food, good cleanliness, and good service",

On some of the larger tortas you could probably get away with splitting the meal, or bringing it home with you. Salsa is spicier than many other Americanized mexican food restaurants, which is an added plus.  At the end of the meal they give you a dum dum lollipop. Only gripe would be the fact that their margaritas are non alcoholic. They should really splurge on getting that liquor license.",

The bad news: I ordered a chicken torta for my husband and got beef instead. I ordered a vegetarian burrito for myself and there was A) a big piece of meat in it and B) a long hair in the center.

The refried beans worked well in the torta but the other components just seemed like a big mess of meaty ingredients piled high.  Good if your looking to munch, not so much if your expecting a top-tier torta.  Mexican food in Cali has still been surprisingly better even though one could assume AZ is closer and home to the real deal. (Like the sign Los Reyes says, Real Authentic Mexico City Food)  They also serve huge drinks without alcohol....wat Hopefully they acquire their beverage license soon.",

I usually always get the Tortas, but when I bring friends along, or the wife they all get different things. I have tried just about everything here. The aguas, and fantastic. I've only ever had one issue, but it was not at this location but at the cave creek one. It seems that sometime the Pina Coladas are made differently. But other than that always great food. Try the licuados! Last but not least, the employees. The waitresses, and especially the hostesses are the definition of hospitality. They treat you like you are part of their family!",

I braved the slight stench and decided to order anyway, hoping the food would make up for it.   I got the shrimp ceviche and iconic del Rey torta. The ceviche looked good but lacked flavor, and the torta gave me strong hotdog flavor vibes that I couldn't shake off.   I have high hopes the beautiful looking quesadillas can be their saving grace for me so I will be back to try those.   For now, Los Reyes is a hard pass for my torta needs!",

Desert - Flan Napolitano  The crust of the tortillas was soft, chewy and beautifully thinly wrapped around the dish #1.  Probably the best tasting crust that I've ever had.  The dish #2 was super-size serving, so we had to take the remaining food home.    The waitress and the rest of the staff was very nice and cordial, as well as helpful with the menu.  We like it so much that we are taking our guest to this spot for dinner tomorrow night.  Made reservations and they allow us to choose the larger-style corner for 4 adults and 1 child.    There is so much on the menu that we want to try, so we plan to come back soon.  This is a happy customer!",

Chips and salsa immediately arrived, and the food was surprisingly quick to arrive after we ordered.  The Del Rey is one of their biggest tortas - ham, cheese, pork, hot dog omelet, and more!  Of course, I had to give this a try since it sounds like a meat lovers dream.  I have to say - it is a little TOO flavorful.  The combination of meats, egg, cheese, and avocado kind of blend together.  While it's not at all bad per se, the tastiness of each ingredient is overwhelmed.  Eh...worth a try anyway.  Burritos were good.  Nice grilled texture, and perfect ratio of ingredients - you have a wide variety of filling choices.  There's also a nice selection of plated entrees.  Price is reasonable - $4 to $10 per dish.  The decor is also nice.  I was expecting a dive-type hole in the wall, but it's actually fairly clean (though I didn't use the restroom and can't judge there).",

It is very spicy but I could not stop eating it. Their other salsa was good as well. I decided on the Mexicana Torta (grilled steak, guac, onions, jalapenos) with horchata and I really liked it. I ended up adding some of the red salsa, but on its own it was good and flavorful. I am already thinking about when I will go back again to try something else.",

Get the agua fresca, try an appetizer (we like the queso dip w mushrooms) and finish with one of the many Torta options they have.    Personally, I love anything with steak at Los Reyes.  If they cook it fresh, it's incredible and very authentic!  My wife had the steak fajita plate thing and I had the steak Torta.  Her steak was obviously fresher and hotter.. Absolutely delicious!!!  Mine was warm, but not quite as freshly cooked.  Still tasty as hell, but I wish they were more consistent.  They have some cool fresh fruit options here.  Both in the agua fresca and in their dessert options.  Not too pricy either!

I did not understand the addition of hotdogs onto this sandwich- seems more like they are going for being eclectic rather than flavorful.  Salsa was rather bland. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Would go back for the smoothies- lots of fun, yummy non-alcoholic beverages.  Would be nice if they served alcohol too!!",

We had the (huge) Botana de Camaron (ceviche, cocktail shrimp, cucumber/tomato/avocado) plate - $12 - to start and enjoyed how refreshing and tasty that was before my Torta Del Rey (5 different meats, an egg, avocado, cheese, etc) - $10 - and my girlfriend's chorizo (made in-house) tacos - $6.25 - were served to the table*.    *Warning: bring a healthy appetite as all of these dishes are made to satisfy.    Finished off with a slice of Tres Leches cake on the house ($5 - Mail Coupon, Thanks Oscar!) and it was sweet dreams from then on...    TL;DR: Great spot for Mexican food in the Tempe area, excellent staff at this location... Come hungry!",

    "text": "I tried my first torta years ago at a Baja Fresh and fell in love with Mexican sandwiches.  Surprisingly enough, Baja Fresh had extremely good tortas and most of the other places I went to couldn't compare.  Man Versus Food introduced me first to the original location in Phoenix and I couldn't get enough of the place.  Then my prayers were answered last year when a location opened up near home in Tempe.  Hallelujah and pass the chips and salsa.  The menu is slightly overwhelming, but the food, from the salads to the beans to the wide selection of tortas is of very good quality.  Yes, I love this particular LRDLT because it's close to home, but more importantly it's an actual restaurant that provides chips and spicy salsa (unlike the Phoenix location) when you first sit down.  Service is friendly and it's fast.  I think I may have gotten my Del Rey Torta before I ordered it.  That's fast service!  Pork, hot dogs, egg, ham and cheese and I don't know what else all in a sandwich?  Yup, that's the magnificently tasty Del Rey.    I highly recommend this place.  If you're a fan of quality Mexican food at extremely reasonable prices and you're not sure if you want some seafood, a salad or a torta, LRDLT can satisfy a variety of cravings.  **Tip 1**  This place serves booze!!!  I love the aguas frescas at the Phoenix location, but without booze, I was left missing that extra something.  I need miss out no longer  **Tip 2**  Do you like grilled veggies like it do?  Order the side of grilled sliced onions and jalapenos and the cucumber slices and radishes.  Oh the humanity!!!  **Tip 3**  Check your mailbox!!!!  I have received several mailers with 20% discounts on your entire LRDLT check!",

The chips are fresh and there is a salsa picante that you can ask for that is very flavorful with a nice kick. We typically get a huarache, the pambazo, or chilaquiles but have never been disappointed there. The portion sizes are large so be forewarned.  There is great value for the cost. They have told us in the past that it is BYOB, but we typically stick to the horchata or aguas frescas.",

We also ordered the carne asada quesadilla on a flour tortilla - it was perfect. Great cheese-to-meat ratio as well as green chili. The tortilla was homemade which makes all the different.

Did not look filling so I ordered a side of rice and beans( they don't serve black beans).  Starting with burrito, bell peppers were under cooked and couldn't eat. Rest of the stuffing was good. Just saw 6 vegetarian options on the menu though. Waitress was too frequent to check on my table like every other minute. I know they care about customers, but check on the status every minute?  Okay, real deal? I paid $14 and yet I wasnt full. Quantities are less for the price you pay.  Decent ambience, sorta mexicano interiors, 0 wait times and not so great food.",

Sweet little grandmas comforted sobbing cherubs, ladies dabbed at their eyes with silk handkerchiefs, and men bowed their heads at the greatness that is Joyce W. --- La reina de la tortas!  Okay, you caught me on my delusion of grandeur. None of this happened. I didn't even get the Torta King Carlo V.! Fake news! Even if this were to happen, my friends would tell me to stop talking and eat my food. #SitDown #StayHumble  It was a spicy hot 111F at 1:30PM on this unforgiving summer day. The things we do to dine with good Yelpers, right? We also had a surprise guest! It's SO GOOD to finally meet you, Alana M.! For my meal, I had a gigantic mangonada and the mini La Reina Torta. If I wasn't going to go after King Carlos V., I'll challenge the queen instead... and oh my goodness. That queen was frickin delicious!   The La Reina Torta had a soft squishy bread that didn't buckle from all the goodies inside. It had ham, cheese, a breaded chicken breast, a breaded beef patty, sausage wrapped with egg, tomato, onions, avocado, and chipotle sauce. The mini was already an intimidating portion and I can't imagine how the regular size would be like. I was extremely satisfied with my lunch and I would definitely come back for more tortas if I were in the area.  In this battle of Joyce v. Food, Joyce won!

Started to disect the second half and saw what I thought was refried beans. Strange... why would one put refried beans on a torta. You do see refried beans in a burro. Hey maybe the roast beef is mixed in with refried beans.  Server asked how I liked the torta. Said it was great what was in it. She said chorizo and potatoe. There are  no refried beans or roast beef in it. That made things pretty clear.  Probably try something else on next trip. Will be sure to do my research ahead of time. Authentic and tasty.

We decided to travel on the city streets instead of traveling on the 60 to the 101 like we normally do Monday through Friday. This restaurant is a sweet, hidden oasis on Southern Ave in Tempe. Their style of cooking is original, old Mexican style. It was delicious! Every bite a mouth watering delight of just the right spicy goodness with a mild touch of heat. I ordered the shrimp tacos with salad and my husband ordered the green chili chicken enchiladas. His meal came with white rice with vegetables tucked inside. Every bite was absolutely amazing. In addition, I ordered a raspberry iced tea--that was sweetened naturally. It was cold and refreshing-just the way I like it.  If you're in the area, I would suggest looking this restaurant up.

The food fantastic, and large. Even half the meal I was full by the end. The waiter, Tony, learned our names in the beginning and continued to use our names the whole time. Tony was attentive to us and the other tables he served as well. When leaving he shook our hand... nobody does that but I appreciated the heck out of it. Also, the bathrooms were as clean as a Marriott hotel's bathroom. The food was great, the service was even better, and the cleanliness was perfect. Definitely recommend if you're looking for Mexican food, I'll be back there when I'm in town again.",

Not too much flavor but fresh. I did ask for a spicy one. And it was not spicy and .... well .... had an interesting taste. Large large menu. Many many choices. Some expensive. Some cheap!  A good variety. We had a chorizo and nopales as well Grilled shrimp Tacos de Alambre de Camaron. Grilled shrimp mixed with bell  pepper, onions, bacon and melted cheese on top, salad, grilled  onions and jalapenos on the side mixed with bell  pepper, onions...  the chorizo was excellent. The Alhambre...no bacon!  What?  Where's the bacon. So so disappointed.  The salad was about a tablespoon size. Ha ha. I was ok with that. The jalapenos were grilled and excellent.   A busy place. Large menu with simple flavors.",

    "text": "A co-worker suggested getting food from here and I'm usually pretty skeptical about places I've never tried but I decided to trust the yelp ratings and give it a shot.  I have to start by saying their delivery service, AZ Delivery 2U, was horrible.  My order confirmation said my food would be here \"ASAP (12:17PM).\"  The driver came in at 12:35PM.  It was hard to get information out of them.  When I called all I got was \"oh, it always takes an hour.\"  If that's the case they should put an hour as the ETA on their confirmations in my opinion.  But I digress.  This review is about the food.  Our lunch was fantastic!  Thankfully still piping hot when the driver (finally) got here.  I had a chicken burrito and it was freaking delicious.  I always have to customize my orders because I'm such a picky eater and my order was exactly the way I asked for it.  My co-worker got a torta and that thing was insane.  It had ham, cheese, an omelet, even a hot dog on it!  He said it was ridiculously good.  I wish this place wasn't so far from work.  I would absolutely get food from here again but certainly not for delivery.",

The menu says super tacos which I expected to be larger than the regular tacos on the menu. When the food came out, in my opinion, these tacos look the same size as the Tacos de asada that my friend ordered. I like the flavor but the texture of the tacos are a bit rubbery in the edge.  I tried the tres leches King Cake. I would not say I don't like it but since I don't like very sweet dessert, I gave up after one bite but people who like sweet food may thing this is good.  The horchata is delicious. Although a first few sips, I felt powders in it but still, that was good PS: I'm saying this from a Tucsonian's perspective because Tucson offers a variety of authentic Mexican food.",

But the Carne asada tacos were not the good I was expecting... They were bland, beans were freshly cold from a can and bland, rice had no flavor and no color and the bistek had no flavor.

The waitress was very friendly and even though I couldn't prounouce the menu items she was very nice. I ordered a horchata, which was wonderful. Then I got a one of the chicken tostada. The sandwich was great. Nice tosted bun with lots of flavorful chicken and filling. the salad on the side was a joke though. more of a decoration than edible. A few radishes, a grilled onion, jalapeno and cucumber on top of a bite or two of lettuce. I did eat part of the onion and added the cucumber and lettuce to the tostada, but now I know what to expect next time. The free chips and salsa were so so. the salsa was very runny with little flavor. Overall because I enjoyed the food I will be back. maybe I'll try a different location, the sewage smell kind of frightens me on what's behind the scenes.",

That was great for the toddler in tow, because she could eat it all, and even slurped full spoonfuls of their salsa (which was odd).   Norteno de res torta is my favorite packed with steak and avocado. Chorizo is really well flavored too (and not at all spicy). But the quesadilla maiz en estilo del rey is the way to go! Gigantic homemade corn tortilla folded over melty cheese and your choice of filling, topped with cotija and crema and cilantro. So tasty.   I've tried their namesake torta del rey before, and only recommend it if you are getting the sandwich to go because that monster is unwieldy (unless you can unhinge your jaw like a snake) and will fall apart despite your best intentions. But then it turns into a sampler platter of every meat they offer? Anyway, at least at home your glutton ways are masked from sight, and you can get as bad as you wanna be on that behemoth torta.   Aguas are good too. Watermelon for life.",

Surprised the place wasn't more packed than it was... we've been here before and love their food.   Salsa was immediately brought to our table and we're big fans of their salsa. Simple, flavorful and authentic.   I almost always order the small Norteno Torta - I adore the flavor and texture combinations and their bolillo bread is so soft and fluffy and flavorful!  My little girl ordered the hamburguesa (or as she calls it, a hang-gubber). We each managed to sneak a bite of it - and it's a mighty fine burger indeed! I may one day try just a burger!  My husband asked our water to \"go authentic\" on him - he left his choice up to the waiter and our waiter did NOT disappoint.

    "text": "I've been here several times and in have to say the food is pretty good and the staff is very friendly. I've tried the Torta del Rey (about $9) and it is packed with meat, eggs, ham and many other yummy things that make it a gigantic Mexican sandwich.  I would split this with another person as it is big, unless of course you have lots of room for the entire yummy Torta.   I've also had the Carne Asada mini tacos ($5.99 for 3) served with cucumbers, lettuce and radish slices. These are good if you're not feeling extremely hungry.   There are many things on the menu including seafood and the regular burritos and typical Mexican dishes you would expect to find.  You MUST try the \"aguas naturales\" ($4) which are made with natural fruit right when you order them.  The strawberry and cantaloupe are my favorite.",

    "text": "Let's get to the good stuff, first... the chips were good.  My experience peaked there.  It certainly is a matter of taste, but the hot sauce they served with the chips, I found particularly disappointing.  Was looking forward to a good salsa, and I don't mean to play the definition game, but the sauce wasn't salsa...perhaps blame it on my American upbringing.  I ordered the enchilada's with the green sauce, and rice.  Again, may be personal taste, but I did not like the taste of the rice at all; totally could be \"real\" Mexican, but didn't dance well with my taste buds.  The enchiladas were bland, thankfully I still had some hot sauce from the chips to pour them.  What kind of ANY restaurant can last these days without serving alcohol?  What kind of ANY Mexican restaurant can survive these days without serving beer and a good margarita.  Knowing that a significant percentage of revenues for restaurants come from liquor and not the food, curious to know how long this place will last...  Anyway, for me, I was very disappointed.  Had gone there while I am in the area visiting because of the close proximity to where I'm staying and the reviews here on Yelp, but this time, wish I had gone with TravelAdvisor instead!",

Also, they told me that they didn't have a spicier salsa, WHAT THE FROCK!? They don't serve alcohol, which isn't why I give them 2 stars but still disappointing cause I wanted a margarita with my torta.   Ordered the torta del Rey, again cause it was on mvf. When it came out it was delicious but it came with potato chips! Mexican restaurant serving me ruffles, you have got to be kidding me. They get two stars cause it wasn't authentic, and could have gotten much better Mexican food somewhere else.",

    "text": "A little insight on the hater reviews I read, please never, ever, ever, compare Taco Bell to any real Mexican restaurant, if you eat that garbage, you do not deserve to eat real Mexican food, as your pallet is used to cheddar cheese on everything and can only like hamburgers, pizzas and hot dogs. Cheddar cheese is nowhere to be found in Mexico except in Mcdonalds and Burger King hamburgers. Don't order to go from an actual restaurant, you wouldn't go to Donovan's and order a steak to go, would you???? Go with time or don't go at all. If you have a service dog, provide proper documentation for it, so that they actually believe you (real service dogs usually have cute vests saying that, and don't pet me signs). Leave the chips alone, they serve huge amounts of food and it will be a waste of food to eat the chips vs the actual food. If you are a vegetarian there is a Sprouts farmers market in the same parking lot, go there and order a glutton free kale sandwich, you have no business going to restaurants unless its True Foods. On the positive: the food is great and as authentic as you can get here in Az. I can only say that for maybe 2 other places in the entire Maricopa county. Huge portions, order wisely. Service is better at the Phoenix location because they need to turn over those tables every second, because of limited spacing. Price very reasonable compared to portions served.",

Delicious food straight from the heart of Mexico.  The meal was fantastic and all I could have asked for. Home made Horchita, outstanding salsa that had real flavor with lots of depth. Guacamole that I could have eaten a gallon of. Much like mine. It's more than just a mashed up Avocado. And our meals were big but we finished them. This place is wonderful and worth the visit.  I'll be getting meals to go in the future since I drive right by it daily.",

Tony was super friendly and super personable it felt like I was being served by one of my own friends. They have an fantastic selection as well. I had the Tacos Azteca because how often do you get to try cactus? It was pretty damn  good. Great texture and had a lightly sour taste so it goes great with the side of beans and the house hot sauce. Here's the kicker; BYOB! They don't serve alcohol but they make delicious virgin drinks that you could spice up with some Tito's or Jose Cuervo. I think it's a huge plus that they let you byob! It's cheaper and you get to bring exactly what you want. Will not be my last time. LOVE IT.",

My boyfriend and I saw that this was mentioned on Man vs. Food and we're immediately intrigued as it is located so close to our house. (Afterwards we found out that the show was centered around a different location. Not sure if that would've made a difference)   Immediately, we were surprised that a Mexican restaurant did not serve alcohol. They had such a pretty drink menu but apparently they were nonalcoholic. So strange.  Then we ordered chips and queso but it ended up being queso fresco, which, was just strange.   We then ordered the tortas mentioned on the show and were severely underwhelmed. Most Mexican food is soaked in spices and this tasted SO bland and flavorless.   The servers were kind but I wouldn't return here as there are SO many other spots with better food than this.",

LOTS of different kinds of tortas  My wife and I are vegetarians, and generally do not eat tortas.  However, there are a variety of other dishes here that will keep us coming back.  BIG portions!  CHEAP!  They don't serve enchiladas or chile rellenos, but they do have great burritos with a distinct flavor.  Their chocoflan also makes a fantastic sweet end to a meal.  If you're looking for authentic Mexico City flavor, this is the place and the locals know it.  Service is generally friendly, the place is clean, and there is always futbol on the television when you sit down.  Highly recommended.  Los Reyes de la Torta:  GOOOOOOOOOOOAL!",

The food is mediocre not terrible and the service was TERRIBLE. Like it was 3 of us, our server walked off before my husband could order. Then our food took forever yet it was kinda cold, that probably didnt help the taste, since the hot dog in my husbands torta was cold. The waitresses were more busy gossiping than checking in on us or refilling our drinks. The restaurant wasn't that busy to have been neglected like that. We were so embarrassed with our guest. We were trying to act cool but finally our family member said something in his super polite way. We will never ever be back. Sucks because i had high hopes.",

After all this stuff I heard about these Reyes places, I must have had too high of expectations. I got enchiladas and a gordita; the enchiladas were standard Mexican restaurant fare. The gordita was, as well, but they went crazy with the cilantro so it was pretty bitter. Not having salt on the tables was annoying, speaking of that. The wife got one of the quesadillas de maiz, and it had a pretty generous meat portion; so, that was cool.  Atmosphere is typical casual Mexican restaurant (soccer on TVs, orange/brown-hued walls with generic \"Mexicanish\" things like sombrero-wearing dolls), but there are actual Mexican patrons in there; so that's a one-up for the authenticity, I reckon.",

It's big and clean - great place for families. It's kind of unique because places this good and authentic are usually dirty little hole-in-the-wall-shopping-plaza-restaurants. But this place is in a free standing building with plenty of seating and booths!   They have free chips and salsa. It's spicy salsa too. Clearly not made for white people. Also, my family were the only white people in there at the time. So ya know it's good.   Service was great. Plenty of parking. Oh and the menu is HUGE. it's kind of overwhelming but they have vegetarian and fish options, so it's a great place for pescatarians.",

This evening the restaurant was fairly empty except for the large party that was there celebrating a child's (?) Birthday. After we finally decided on what we were having and ordered I realized they actually close fairly early.  Eight p.m. seems like an early hour to close. Our dinners were delivered moments after our beverages had been dropped off and they looked so good.  Mmm.  One of the items delivered was actually not what had been ordered.  She brought two (2) of the Tortas del Ray and one was a tally supposed to be an omelette.   It was discussed and then decided it would be consumed instead of sending it back and waiting for the correct entree to be made . All of it was tasty. And it was just too much.   So of course we had to split the Esquimo.  I honestly can't recommend one thing because the few times I've dined here I've always had something different and they've all been really good. So I would suggest you be adventurous, try something new.",

From the welcoming presence, to the friendly and efficient service, to the quality of food, cleanliness of the restaurant, the inviting atmosphere, and prices are all terrific...  My fiance and I decided to give Los Reyes a try a little over a month ago. The parking lot didn't look very busy, but as we entered the restaurant we were pleasantly surprised to find that it was packed with predominantly Hispanic patrons (always a good sign in a Mexican restaurant). Everyone appeared to be having a good experience at each table as we walked by; which, set the tone.   As we were being seated, we noticed servers walking by with trays of food, all the dishes had beautiful presentation. There was authentic Mexican music playing, informative and friendly staff to match. As we opened the menus, we noticed that Los Reyes was featured on Man vs. Food; which, was also another good sign.   Tony was our server, who came over promptly, welcomed us, then gave us the run down of house favorites and what Los Reyes is best known for. He was very accommodating, social and aware of our needs. Great service from him and all who we had interface with each time. Tony shared the history of the restaurant and expressed his gratitude for being a part of the family.   The food is extremely flavorful authentic style Mexican from (Mexico City) with perfect portions and affordably priced. We thoroughly enjoyed our time from start to finish and kept observing how well we felt we were taken care of there. I can't speak highly enough about our experiences here! We've visited four times in the last month and a half and will definitely return. The place is impeccable!",
