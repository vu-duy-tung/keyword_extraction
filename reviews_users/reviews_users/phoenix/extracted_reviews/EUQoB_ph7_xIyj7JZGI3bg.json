The wait was a half an hour, not something I have patience for but since we were with friends, we stuck it out.   After we were finally seated, it was 45 minutes before we were served our entrees and then we got one by itself and the rest of the table had to wait for theirs. It would be understandable if the whole restaurant was slow, but two other tables who came in after us were served before we were.   Our server kept saying \"I'm sorry for the wait\" as her mantra.  I'm sorry, too, for a very unpleasant experience.",

Bolognese Ragu sauce is made up of five kinds of sausage and ground turkey, and is mixed in with homemade pasta to create the final amazing product. The pasta was awesome, and I loved the meaty sauce. It was a nice change of pace from the heavy tomato based sauces that are so common.  The staff was very friendly and helpful and the owner was definitely part of the action and greeted all of the tables on several occasions.   I would say that the prices were equal to the food that was put out. Not what I would consider a cheap restaurant, but not high end either. Giuseppe's would be an ideal place for a nice casual night out.   Above average food and service gives Giuseppe's an above average rating of four stars.",

I mean, they make fresh home-made fettuccini- who makes home-made pasta nowadays?    It was quite refreshing to see pan seared calamari instead of deep fried. The sauce that the calamari was soaked in tasted phenomenal with some garlic bread!  Giuseppe's has a very homey feel- small tables for a romantic lunch or dinner for two.    Overall, two thumbs up for this quaint restaurant find. Next time, I will try the butternut squash ravioli!",

They were not busy when we got there but were expecting a larger party later. Weirdly the sat us right next to where the large party was going to be. Not sure why but the placement was weird since they had other open two tops. The server gave us the run down of specials. We decided to split a ceasar salad and we ordered entrees. The ceasar was ok could have used more dressing. The bologonese ragu however was AMAZING!! Some of the best pasta I have ever eaten. My colleague also commented on his chicken parm and said the pasta was very good. The server was very slow in picking up the check but she had gotten busy with more tables and the larger party by that time. But overall it was very good and I will be back with my husband next time!!",

From the first friendly hello when you enter the door you are treated as if you are an old friend even if  you're a first time visitor like I was.   The food is amazing. Homemade pasta is so yummy. Be advised, portions are very generous-so share or be prepared to take home leftovers, which is not a bad thing.

The staff and the food, on the other hand, make the experience fantastic! All of the pasta is hand-made in house!  Met the owner, Rich, and he is an awesome guy who cares most about quality and authenticity.   Great for a quiet dinner. I ate bruschetta, chicken parm, paired with a delicious cab-mix wine and ended things with a creme brulee. I was basically in heaven.

    "text": "I stumbled upon this place about a two and a half ago when I was shopping at the neighboring Sprouts.  I generally do not go out for Italian, but decided to give it a try because my girlfriend and I were a bit burned out on some of our other locals.  Let me just that I was wowed.  Their eggplant parm is fantastic -- thinly sliced, breaded, and served on top of a bed of homemade penne pasta. (All of their pasta is homemade in fact)  Their bread was also very good.  It quickly became one of our favorite regular restaurants.    I loved their eggplant parm so much that it was difficult to stray away from it and try other items on the menu.  When I finally did though, it was equally delicious.  It was penne and parmesan dish with asparagus and red chili flakes.   I highly recommend it.  My girlfriend loves the lasagne.  The pear salad also is very tasty appetizer.  The waitress Cindi is great.  She always remembers us and treats us likely regular weekly customers even though we only make it over to that neighborhood every couple of months or so.  We really could not ask for more personable service.  The owner is nice as well.  They now have a lot of pictures up from the Triple D visit, but they were very excited about it.  It was a big deal to them and I don't think that should be a knock against them. (Personally, I did not know who the guy was...old school, no cable)  As for the price and food portions, I think that iGiuseppe's is both fair and filling.  We always leave there filled. (Eat more bread or try the pear salad if you are really hungry) As for the price, most plates are between $10 and $14.  For 2 1/2 people (one four year old), we usually wind up spending between $45 and $55, which includes a healthy tip.  This place is far better than some corporate chain in Old Town (Buca's, Olive Garden, Oregano's, etc) and it is worth the money.",

Yes, it's True - the atmosphere (strip mall) vs. the servings (small, yet satisfying) vs. the price (on the high side) aren't consistent. For what we paid, I'd expect  fine dining ambiance, and bread and salad to be included with the meals. With that being said, the food was fresh and absolutely delicious -- a welcome relief from all of the \"franchise\" food we've experienced since moving here about a month ago. We LOVE good quality  mom and pop restaurants, and this hits the mark completely, which makes it well worth the money. The waitress was very cordial, the food was served timely, and  the owner of the restaurant was spirited and friendly in making his way around to his guests. My rating is 5 stars because I feel Giuseppe's food, all by itself, deserves more than a overall 3.5 rating.",

Another time it was another key ingredient.  They say oh, this will be as good but it isn't.  They try to talk you up to their home made pasta but it's only one kind of pasta.  So spaghetti carbonara with the upgrade isn't spaghetti carbonara at all it's fettuchini carbonara. They do make an excellent Tiramissu.  However, the cost is as much as a whole meal at other restaurants. It's a good, overpriced restaurant but I would rather go to another restaurant which is equally as good such as Christo's. NEVER arrange to meet friends at Giuseppe's for supper .  They don't take reservations and your party can easily cool your heels for very long times. Would I go if you were paying the bill?  YES Would I go on my own?  NO",

    "text": "Went there tonight.  Should have been a red flag when we walked in on a Tuesday evening at dinnertime (5:30pm) and the place was empty.  Only two stars, and that was only because of the service. We decided to try it since seeing it on Food Network.  Way overpriced ($17 for ravioli and about $13-15 for my macaroni - don't remember the price, however, the macaroni wasn't really macaroni. He used the same fettucini noodles he used for the other dishes).  I was going to order the gnocchi, but after finding out it was frozen and brought in by another outside kitchen, I opted out.  I make my own gnocchi at home and any italian restaurant who doesn't, is a phony.   Drinks are brought to your table in cans with plastic cups and ice (probably so they don't have to give you refills), which was surprising considering the prices.  Very, very disappointed.  My macaroni & cheese was swimming in oil (or butter)....literally swimming!!!  I didn't eat mine. My husband said his ravioli was good (should be, for the price).  All said, I wouldn't go back again, but at least I can say I tried it.  The waitress tried to make it right by offering me a replacement or a dessert, but I opted to just eat the bread at the table.  Just the two of us and after tax and tip $50 (two entrees, appetizer and two cans of coke).  Waaay too much money for unhealthy italian (didn't think it was possible to make italian unhealthy...oh, well). My husband insisted on driving straight to Red Devil but instead we went to the QT for some lottery tickets and after looking behind us at the \"hot food\" section, decided we should have gone with the $2.00 pizza at QT and saved ourselves lots of money.  We're not picky eaters either, but this was, as Guy Fieri always says, \"out of bounds\" and not in a good way.",

    "text": "I have been waiting to try this place for months now. Purchased a Local Dines coupon and went the other day for lunch. First impression was a little strange as there is no table service. You are pleasantly greeted by a nice hard working elderly lady who instructs you to order at the window and then take a seat while your food is prepared. Once the food is ready she beckons to you from across the room so that you can come pick up your food in the window. Not sure if this is just a lunch thing and if dinner service has a different system but once I understood how the system worked it was fine. As for the food... We ordered the famed bolognese ragu over linguine, chicken parm., and fettuccine alfredo. My wife had the bolognese and said it was just okay. The pasta overwhelmed the dish with very little bolognese mixed in so it was a little dry and flavorless, somewhat disappointing. The chicken parm. was actually pretty tasty in my opinion and worthy of ordering again. The fettuccine alfredo was not good at all. Very basic pasta with cream. There was no real taste at all and was a total disappointment. Overall I think that this place rides on the coattails of the triple D review from Guy Fieri. I do not understand the long lines and rave reviews to be honest. Oh, one last thing... As previously mentioned we used a Local Dines $15 for $30 worth of food coupon. When I got the bill at the end the nice older lady added up the food, deducted the coupon amount,then proceeded to add 18% gratuity to the bill based on the total amount without even asking. I have no issue with a tip, but presuming 18% when there is no real table service, just a woman beckoning to you from a window, well I thought that a bit much. Yes, she did come out from behind the window and was very nice, but it was not her position to add 18% tip to a four top table. At the end of the day this place is 35 minutes from my home and in no way justifying of the drive and a follow up visit. Sorry Giuseppe's on 28th, I wish I had found a True hole in the wall to call home, but to the contrary was disappointed with your food.",

I ordered the least expensive bottle of Chianti for $32 ( what they call \"house\",  and this is not a fancy place) and I got attitude for it!  Our waiter asked: \"Wasn't I sure I wanted the next step up at $38?\" I did not want to pay more. Even after I accepted the tasting, the wandering owner of the place shot our waiter a look like \"dig Mr. Cheapskate over there...\" The waiter poured three half glasses from our bottle. Then the waiter took the bottle away. ( Bad sign, in retrospect) When I asked for the rest of the bottle, he said we finished it! I know wine bottles and there were  more than three half glasses in that bottle. I asked if he was sure and he said yes. Rather than create a scene with my party - a buzz kill for sure to argue over this -  I ordered three more glasses  - at an additional $24. The waiter opened a new bottle, poured, and guess what, there was about a half bottle left!  I was not happy! Not happy about the brazen attitude for ordering a $32 bottle or the very short first bottle. I think I was scammed.  Every order should be respected. The food was good, I admit, and reasonably priced but it must act as a lure to soak you on the wine. They do carry out and this would be the only way to enjoy this place, in my opinion.Better yet, try someplace else.",

It is small, smaller than it seemed on t.v., the staff are very friendly and the ambiance is not high end but most were dressed business casual. I'd rather overdressed than under (imho).  For cocktails...I had the Limoncello Martini, not too sweet and very cold just perfect for me. My husband had a Chianti, which I also had with supper, though we like our reds slightly chilled it was great accompaniment to our meal.  Appetizers - The Burrata: house made mozzarella (filled with mozzarella and cream!) on top of prosciutto, arugula with pesto and balsamic and the Suppli di Riso (risotto rice balls) served on house made tomato sauce . The Burrata was hands down the winner! In fact I told my husband it was one of the best appetizers I have ever had. My husband liked the Risotto rice balls a lot more than I did. I ate one he ate the other two...but the Burrata had to be shared to the last bite. Also had garlic bread which was really nicely done; slightly blackened just a bit crunchy on the outside and soft in the center.   Entrees - When I go for Italian I like to order what I don't cook at home so I had the Lasagna (it's a lot of work for two). This was more cheesy than meaty but that's a good thing because it was creamy and soft (almost silky texture) and the tomato sauce had a slight savory tartness to it that pleased my palate. My husband had the Bolognese Ragu (between 5-7 meats) with house made tagliatelle...this is a seriously delicious meal! The tagliatelle is thick (good thing) and rustic but then paired with that Ragu, wow. It was full flavored, rich, savory, absolutely scrumptious.  We shared the Tiramisu which was very good. The texture is more fluffy (more creamy mascarpone) versus meatier (more lady fingers). My husband felt it could have been a bit more coffee flavored....but we ate the whole thing.  The portions were good for us. I could only eat 1/2 my Lasagna and my husband ate all his Ragu and said I should have taken his plate (and bread) away from him before he had finished! We'll be back...",

The waiter greeted us promptly and even the chef himself came out to check on tables and make sure things were running smoothly. I ordered their lobster ravioli with sage and brown butter and my husband ordered classic fettuccine and meatballs with homemade pasta. I can't begin to explain the lobster ravioli accept to say that I have eaten Italian food, ravioli in particular all over the country.  This is hands down THE BEST I have ever had. The restaurant offers several different types of ravioli but if you are a lobster fan this is a must try! My husbands dish was equally delicious, there is truly nothing like homemade pasta. Tucked away in a small strip mall this restaurant may be easily missed but do yourself a favor and turn on your GPS so you don't miss it.",

We told them there was 6 and they asked us to sit outside while we get the table ready. When the rest of the party got here 10 minutes later they still hadn't finished setting the table so as we were sitting down we had a server setting drinks right over our heads. When I ordered Dr.Pepper it took at least 10 minutes for it to come out ,but the worst of all was that it was super watered down. When all the drinks finally came out my mom's champagne had no bubbles! Our server was very nice but she didn't come by often and she asked for the wine list so she could see what was on it. They also had a really small place and bathroom. The color scheme or design wasn't pretty. When she came to get the check she took it but then came back to ask where our card was. She asked did you put it on the top and we kindly told her it was in the card slot. She didn't think to look there which wouldn't look good on the restaurant. Some of the really good things were the food. All the food was amazing. The music was nice and the owner would stop by and ask us how our day was and just other conversation topics. I would recommend going there for the food but if you are in a rush then you shouldn't go because of the service.",

I've just traveled to Italy and fell in love with the taste of Limoncello .. So I was interested to taste how this came together. Rich and amazing! I took half of my entree home. The Squid Ink Pasta with clams was ordered at our table, as well. Perfecto! So different!   To me the portions were just enough for dinner and a little to take home. The bruschettas were ample servings as are the salads, which two could easily share.   The Key Lime Pie is delicate and housemade, as well. I highly recommend! It's not a tart, tart taste like some key lime pies, it's just enough.   The place filled up by 630pm. Including the patio.  The only thing I would change is the bread. A good Italian restaurant needs good, hot Tuscan bread and oils and butter served. The rest...is mmmmmmmm :)",

You can't lose when you eat here! Sure it's a tiny off the wall place, but who care's.. I don't need fancy decorations or overpriced wines to enjoy quality food like some of the reviewers of this establishment. Just give me quality food and I'm happy...  My favorite items are:  Chicken  Parm Bolognese Ragu Gnocchi with Red Sauce  and no meal is complete without eating this...  \"Italian Mac and Cheese - a layer each of parmigiano, mozzarella, fontina, prosciutto, cream and butter backed until golden brown\"  I could eat that everyday with any meal and would be in cheese paradise!",

    "text": "This was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  Ill start with our first impression... my dad walks to the patio entrance ahead of us and is asked how many in his party, the tells him 8.  The man tells him we should have called ahead.  We are there for a short time while he put two tables together, while he is moving things around the owner comes and asks my dad how many.  My dad tells him 8 and starts to tell him they are setting it up and them the man says, OK how many? I don't know if he thought he was kidding but we then said 8 and we are being seated.  Not a great start, no eye contact and an awkward encounter, we are then seated.  I dont know if they do not have beverages but we were never offered, water was brought out for all as we sat. We ordered an overly expensive rice ball for our appetizer and garlic bread, neither warm or good in flavor.  Let me start by saying the food that was eaten was not restaurant quality. It was more like I came to your house for dinner meaning it was every day food, nothing to brag about, nothing special.  We then order dinner, my dad and I split a seafood pasta and our waitress so kindly had them put it in two bowls. This was the best and only good part of our experience as we didn't ask, good thinking and active listening on her part.   Our food comes, remember there are 8 of us so lots of food. Only 1 dish was hot. Mac and cheese and lasagna are obviously premade (expected) but not hot. Butternut squash Ravioli it's self was good but lukewarm,  drowning in a sea of what was to be brown butter but actually tasted of burnt oil. Soup, nothing to brag or spend time on and the baked ziti with sausage while hot, nothing special.   The dish we split was their seafood with black pasta, not hot but I enjoyed it until my dad said \"that doesn't look good\" On our shell plate he puts down a clam. I look at it thinking what I was looking at was maybe an herb or something and so I picked it up and I smell it, horrible but tar like smell. It dripped on the plate a black substance. The clam was obviously not good, rotted. Now I understand the chances here, it's she'll fish. I expected to tell the woman waiting on us and she say, I'm sorry let's get you a fresh plate but I got a \"oh, let me see this\" she took it and showed the man who set up our table. He says you gotta talk to Rich, I believe that's the owners name.   Now at this point wed been there a. While, the owners talking to his patio and inside guests, visiting each table but ours and the two behind us. He's very friendly and very talkative,  it took about 10 minutes for him to finally be free so she could let him know we had a situation. He comes to me and asks how he can help, I started to tell him about the clam and he tells me he saw it like it was nothing. I told him it was gross and before I could say more he got argumentative.   Asks what I want him to do, I let him know that we did not want to finish the food given the situation.  He tells me, \"it's not in your food\" this upset me, it was at one point and it dripped out. He says it was a bad clam, I'm not going to defend myself,  do you want something else. I hear the line, I'm not going to defend it or myself a few times. He asks again, do you want something else as he abruptly takes our plates and I told him no, we would like our check seeing his attitude just walked my appetite. He walked away and didn't look back. The waitress asked if he took care of us in short i said no and we wanted to leave.  She apologised for him.  It took 10 minutes to then get a box for my stepmothers ziti so we could get the heck out. Note it took one minute to get the check when requsted. He had no problem taking our money.  $80 plus dollar tab for crap. What's worse is all he had to do was say, I'm sorry there was a bad clam. Let me remake it or something else for you.  I wasn't looking for a handout. Instead I got this, horrible.  Lets put it this way, It's 6am and I've already told 4 people NEVER to go here. Take a lesson in kindness sir.  We the customer are your business.",

At first bite I was severely disappointed. It was tasteless and devoid of flavor. Felt like I was eating mushed up McDonalds hamburger meat with some pasta around it. Actually, MecD's would've had more taste. Never again.",

Biggest surprise, beverages other than wine are served in 12 oz clear plastic glasses. Seriously? Plastic glasses? They also put white butcher paper on the tables over the table cloths. Macaroni Grill does that but there they give you crayons to doodle with as you wait for your dinner. A previous review said \"Giuseppe's is a restaurant with an identity problem.\" I concur. It seems like the owner is going for a fine dining ambiance but missing the mark by using plastic glasses and paper coverings to save on tablecloths.",

Everything tasted fresh and bursting with flavor. I shared the \"Da California\" salad with a friend (Avocado & Cherry tomatoes, Black Olives).  It was absolutely delicious. I ordered the Bolognese Ragu that Giuseppe's is famous for (six meats) served over fresh made pasta. If I had to request a last meal this might be it, the Bolognese Ragu was phenomenal the pasta was perfect.

We just got back from returning our ***70 dollar take-out order*** (which consisted of 2 gnocchi, 1 bolognese, and 1 linguini and clam sauce, by the way) to a very rude and egotistical owner. We called beforehand to merely voice our concerns about this incredibly expensive, yet mediocre meal. The owner answered the phone and was not only unconcerned, but was very argumentative, saying that he \"only gets a complaint once every 2 months\" and that he has a \"packed house.\" He made us feel like our opinions didn't matter in the least bit. He begrudgingly told us to bring our food back for a refund, so we did just that. When we arrived, he met us outside and argued with us a bit more, emphasizing that his 20 seat restaurant was full. When we tried to explain our concerns with the food, he said \"whatever\" and left, shortly returning with our refund. Food: -Clam and fettuccine-far too salty -Tomato sauce- tastes like canned -Gnocchi-mushy, no texture -Bolognese-no flavor  Bottom line: -Rude, arrogant owner -Bland,over-priced food -Never returning!!  I really didn't want to have to write this review, since I live in the neighborhood and want this place to be good. Before it appeared on Food Network, although expensive, this place was quite good. I just don't want anyone else to waste their time and money when there are so many other good Italian restaurants to eat in Phoenix. (e.g. Aiello's)",

The food is consistently good however the lack of service killed the experience today. Unlike dinner for lunch you have to walk up to the counter and place your order, pay and retrieve your own plate when ready.  I sat in the middle table which was a big mistake as people kept coming in and I had ass and elbows side to side with people waiting to get to the counter.  With the amount of lunch business you think they cold have a server like dinner.  They also do not do half orders for lunch.  Sadly I will not return for lunch but will for dinner someday.",

I didn't even order a drink. To me the setting is for lunch. I don't think Id want to go and sit down for dinner as its not really a sit down style restaurant. If you are set up for a casual lunch you should have a lunch menu or if you are wanting to be a real restaurant and serve dinner I think you should have real tables, chairs, maybe a booth or two and set it up that way.   I guess I wouldn't want to go back for lunch or for dinner. I must have missed it.   Food - 3.5, Service 3, Ambiance 2.5, Value 2",

Each table had a flameless candle which seemed pointless because the lights above were as bright as a factory. We had the bean soup and the gnocchi with the tomato cream sauce.  The soup was fair but the gnocchi was definitely lacking a bit of flavor, I had to add salt. I asked for bread in which the waiter replied he could bring out some basic bread or if we wanted some amazing garlic bread it would only be $4 bucks. So of course I had to taste what was so amazing about this garlic bread. It was not amazing in the least, just garlic-infused olive oil drizzled over thinly sliced white bread that was barely toasted. We also ordered a lemon-lime Italian soda which kinda made me gag. It wasn't sweet, more sour and tasted slightly bitter. 3 stars is generous of me for this overly-boasting \"As Seen on the Food Network\" restaurant.

    "text": "A co-worker and I stopped in at Giuseppe's for lunch this week because we were visiting a store in the same shopping center and saw the sign hanging out front about them being featured on a show on the Food Network.  I did see the show and had been meaning to stop so it seemed like a perfect time.  I expected to be blown away and was a little disappointed.  The salad was pretty good but nothing spectacular...we're talking your basic iceberg lettuce with tomatoes and a very nice Italian dressing.  I had a chicken dish with fettucini which, while there was a lot of it, was bland and oily and the chicken was dry and way overcooked.  I'm from Chicago (as it seems like most Phoenicians are) and have experienced excellent Italian so know there has to be something better in the valley.  Maybe their sandwiches are better or maybe I just ordered one of their \"eh\" dishes or maybe the \"chef\" (cook) was having an off day.  So, in my opinion Giuseppe's is barely average food and way over priced.  Skip it unless you're starving and nothing else is open.",

I was stuffed from the 6 meat sauce plus homemade noodles, my husband had the Oso Busco. It is small, but they do not force you out or make you feel uncomfortable talking over your meal (unlike some other restaurants).  My food was lovely and a generous portion, we did have desert and coffee as well.  For those of you who had a bad server or a bad run in with \"the boss\" I did not have that experience at all. The service was friendly, and the boss was helping some VERY nasty people at a table near us and trying to be accommodating as best as he could. I never am one to complain about decore or seating, if you are giving me good food, I will sit on a stump, so the plastic chairs do not bother me. I would say give it a try....",

    "text": "I was in the Phoenix area for baseball spring training and was looking for a unique restarant experience.  As a huge fan of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, I could not pass this restaurant up, as I had never had a bad experience at a restaurant that Guy Fieri had recommended.  I went there with several friends (party of 6, including children).    My friend and I started with the house salad, which consisted of mixed greens with a very heavy oil vinegrette on it.  The mixed greens were fresh and tasty, but there was so much oil left on my plate after eating the salad, that I used it with the Italian bread that was served to the table before the main course.  Across the table, we ordered the spaghetti, maccaroni and cheese, and the spaghetti neri (squid ink pasta with oysters, shrimp, and calamari).  I had the spaghetti neri.  I did not try the other dishes, but they looked and smelled delicious.  The spaghetti neri was fairly tastless in terms of the tomato+wine sauce, and was very bland and dissappointing.  The seafood (oysters in particular) were a bit \"fishy\", similar to sushi purchased in a groccery store (sometimes), but not so bad as to preclude eating.  However, the next day, I wish I had not, I had very bad case of food poisening (fever, vomiting) that night and the next day.  I called the restaurant the next day to let them know their seafood might be bad and the manager/owner (Rich) told me it couldn't possibly be their food.  Since my friend and I ate the same foods that day, except for the spaghetti neri, I am 100% sure it was that dish.  I cannot recommend this restaurant.  I am terribly dissappointed at quality of the food, and the owner's attitude, which was brash and bit defensive.  In fact, he did not agree to remove the remaining seafood from the same batch, so that others may not get sick, as well, though he did offer to send a coupon for a free meal on my next trip.  I can only hope that others did not suffer the same fate as I.  If you do dine here, stick to the spaghetti or maccaroni with cheese, and do not order the spaghetti neri!",

Once not bad, I had the clam sauce our group of 8 had a variety of dishes and everyone was fairly happy.  We had waited over an hour at the bar up the street, maybe we were just hungry and a little drunk.  Owner started out rude then warmed up when he heard the group was from the East. Went back a second time because a friend had heard good things.  Many items other than pasta were \"sold out\"...  This time the rude owner did not warm up... The only reason I went back a third time last week was because another couple heard about them on the food network and really wanted to try it.  Let me just say, none of us will be back.  The owner again was rude food less than mediocre wine by the glass was undrinkable.  This is the first negative review I have ever given.  But when i saw those 4s and 5s I just couldn't believe it.  I can live with the food being \"fine\" but I can not give that kind of money to an owner who treats his customers as if they are lucky to have gotten a seat in his crowded old school room.",

The osso bucco came out cold, which is not good.  But we told the waitress and she quickly got that taken care of.  It was good, extremely meaty, but not really worth the cost or wait in my opinion.    The black squid ink pasta was very good.  It wasn't salty enough, but after we added a little on our own, it was perfect.  The saving grace that took this place from a 2 star to a 3 for me was the tiramisu.  It's the classic no frills tiramisu that I so dearly miss these days when all the restaurants try to make fancy-over-the-top ones.  It was creamy, light, and just perfect.  I'd go back for the tiramisu.",

The 4 of us had different dishes. I ordered the \"Alex\" pasta dish, slightly spicy, perfect creamy tomato sauce, totally YUM! the meatballs were AWESOME! Can't wait to try a Meat Ball Sandwich!  You can bring in your own alcohol if you drink wine or beer, There is no corking fee. Pretty cool stuff. the is no bar, just food.  Downside, if you get there early and sit inside, you can speak and hear each other. If you get there when it starts to fill up you can barely hear yourself think. So Sad.  All in all, worth the trip!",

A non assuming Italian Restaurant located in a strip mall. The first night we ate there were were struck by the family oriented atmosphere and excellent service. We enjoyed our experience so much that we went again. The sangria was delicious and the food was some of the best Italian we have ever had. My son, a very picky eater found himself eating a whole plate of the spaghetti and meatballs with house made pasta. Seriously he does not eat pasta! I guess he does now. He ate the whole thing and enjoyed it thoroughly!  I had the clams and squid ink pasta special and then the carbonara with house made noodles for dinner. I had the burrata and bruschetta appetizers , key lime pie for dessert. Everyone in our party ordered something different and everyone said the same thing. Giuseppe's is the best ever!  Thanks you Antonio for the parmesan and for being so warm and entertaining!",

I'm sitting here at the restaurant having a delicious and decadent lobster ravioli while thinking to myself, how is it possible that I didn't know about this place? The ingredients are quality, simple, fragrant, lovely texture, the lobster tastes fresh. Service is great, lovely intimate decor. I would definitely consider this place for a date night. The price is reasonable for the portion size and taking quality into mind I would say even generous. They give you a basket of fresh baked bread and butter, gloriously fluffy and tasty. This was such a pleasant surprise. I can't wait to come back. Ask for Cindy, she's a sweetheart and has great recommendations!",

Our main dishes were out of control. I ordered the penne pasta with the Gorgonzola cream sauce, sausage and sugar beets. My friends got seafood risotto and the bolognese ragu. All amazing! We shared and practically licked our plates clean.   Our server was friendly and attentive. It's a very clean establishment. We sat outside on a nice night and their patio is so cute.   It's definitely a neighborhood secret since it's small and in a shopping center. So happy my friends boyfriend grew up around here, so he suggested the place.",

Made a reservation for 7:00, dinner did not hit out table until 8:07.  It was busy on Friday, but an hour was a long wait.  The brushetta with several flavors was really great.  Very recommended.  Then, the wait started..... The butternut squash I had waited two years to savor once more.....very little flavor.  Minimal squash, mostly pasta.  Drowned in what seemed more like margarine than butter.  Wife had the Wild Boar Ragu.  Tasted  like ground beef with Prego. We were not happy with the food at all.  In hindsight, multiple orders of the brushetta would have been the ticket.  Key lime pie was really good. Ordered decaf coffee as it was late in the evening for regular coffee.  It was watered down coffee.  How do you mess up coffee? The only thing I could think of was the cooks on those other days were off this night. It happens. We'll look out for a new place to make our new \"traditional\" spot during next Spring Training.  Maybe we should focus on Spring Training baseball when in Phoenix.",

It was an interesting combination bit worked well together.   Pasta was cooked aldente perfect and the sauce had just a hint of the gorgonzola so not to overwhelm the dish.  The usual baked ziti and chicken Alfredo were also or see red and immensely enjoyed.    You can smell the goodne$ of the home cooked Italian maranera sauce as soon as u enter the small dining area where you quickly greeted by the owner and sharing stories with him like an old friend.   We will definitely come back and enjoy this place.   The only reason this is not 5 stars is that we had to wait too long for our food so plan plenty of time for your visit.   They had a huge wine selection as well as a nice in house made deserts.   Tiramisu was so light and fluffy with generous portions it was the perfect follow up to our dinner.     Giuseppe I'm glad you stopped playing the cello to open this restaurant.    You are making beautiful music at the restaurant now.",

That being said, the server was trying her hardest to keep up and we are not sure why the owner wasn't pitching in to help her at all. After 20 minutes, we were asked what we wanted to drink. After another 10 minutes (30 minutes total) we were finally asked what we wanted to order. For the next 30 minutes we were told over and over and over, we were the next order up. We weren't. The reason we weren't is because after 60 minutes of waiting for paparedelle Bolognese, we were told that our ticket had been misplaced and our order never was made. Yes, they apologized and yes we got one free dessert, but how do you not notice that table for 2 is sitting there waiting, while all the tables that came in before and after you are eating and all ready ordering desserts? We will not return. Many other great Italian restaurants to choose from here in the area.",

At first I thought, well maybe I don't like more authentic Italian food and that's why I'm not enjoying this.

It wasthe final of my two-day fat load for this new diet i'm on and so I though \"Italian\" The place was crowded, usually a good sign, but the ambiance- what ambiance? The presentation of the food was worse than what I do in my own home. We \"upgraded\" for $1 on each of our plates for homemade pasta (you would hope it would always be homemade). I had the ragu, it was ok- a little odd tasting. My fiance had the alfredo, which was kinda watery. Plus the garlic bread was $1/piece and was very hard to chew. All in all, not good or bad- but WAY overpriced! Over $10 per plate plus the bread and we didn't have more than one drink b/c the service was SLOW. Maybe its better at lunch? hmmmmm",

Since we weren't sure when we would be able to arrive at the restaurant due to playing and we needed a table for 20, the owner, Richard, was nice enough to offer up his restaurant and his staff after hours at 9pm for us. How awesome is that!  Richard and his staff were amazingly friendly and helpful, especially considering they were staying after hours to serve a rowdy bunch of softball players.    Between all the people in our party,  we tried a huge variety of the menu.  The food was all delicious and came flying out of the kitchen.  A few stands outs being the Veal Osso Buco and Squid Ink Pasta w/Shrimp and Calamari.  Oh and the Gorgonzola and Honey Bruschetta and the Tiramisu are MUST TRIES!  A HUGE THANK YOU to Richard and his staff for a fabulous dinner. The whole team was grateful for all you did for us and very satisfied with the dinning experience you provided.",

After returning from a holiday in Italy, we craved genuine carbonara (which, if you don't know, is not cream based but made with egg and Parmesan). After hunting high and low, and eating countless disappointments, we called Guiseppe's before making the drive to ask how they prepare theirs. When Richard said \"of course it has egg\" like we were dolts for even asking, we knew we had to go. And sure enough, it's the best we've had since returning to the US. I kid you not, my wife teared up on the first bite out of sheer joy at the authentic taste. Richard is the owner and operator, and like a lot of New Yorkers is friendly once you break the ice.  We haven't tried any entrees other than the carbonara (with homemade pasta), but have been back several times just for it. On one occasion we had a nice mozzarella spinach antipasto. And after hearing another table rave about the tiramisu, we ordered a slice and were elated by it. Suddenly, the woman who contemplated licking the dish clean didn't seem so unreasonable.  Why four stars instead of five? Well you can always expect a wait at this 28-seat restaurant, and the service is friendly but distracted.",

I never would have guessed based on the big sign outside, the framed poster from \"Guys Big Bite\" on one wall, the caricature of Guy spray painted directly on the wall, the autographed photo of Guy on the other wall, or certain dishes on the menu labeled as being featured on the food network.  OK, OK... we get it- you were on TV.   Normally, I would have given this place 4 stars; I used to work down the street and my coworkers and I had take out from here countless times. I have only had the capellini with meat sauce, and the marinara sauce is worth raving over. Today was my first time dining in the restaurant, and will now probably be the last I eat anything from there. I should have stuck with take out only!  Dinner was just my husband and me, our bill was $42 (before the tip), and truly was ridiculous for what we had. Paper table cloths on the tables, water served in plastic cups, I ordered a soda, which was brought to me in the can.  We both had small dinner salads, I basically had spaghetti, my husband had some alfredo type dish that was just noodles and bland sauce. We ordered bread, which was an extra $3 charge, but was never brought to us (but also not charged on our bill). I should note as an aside that every time we picked up lunch bread was included with no charge. The waiter tried to upsale everything- I wanted a soda, my husband stuck with water- the waiter pointed out the wine list 3 times. I wanted capellini and sauce, he suggested the Bolognese instead, I declined. I can't imagine what the bill would have been for a diner atmosphere in a strip mall, bad service, and semi-decent food if we had taken any of the waiter's suggestions. We don't mind paying for good food, but the prices do not match the decor, or the service, of the place.  Many other places in the Phoenix area have been featured on Food Network show's as well, not just this one. I'm thinking if you want to try out any of them, skip over this one.",

Butternut Squash Ravioli in a brown butter sauce (one of the limited rotating specials) was perfect, and the very large portion of lasagna (at just $13.5) was almost as good as mom's :).  Smallish, quaint, a touch of cheese on the billboard (\"As seen on TV\") make it a perfect spot for a quiet romantic dinner as well as a group of 6-8.  Larger groups may be challenged as I don't *think* they take reservations - but check on that ....",

Red sauce was good (not too sweet as sauces tend to be in Phoenix) and fettucini alfredo (homemade noodles) was excellent.  However, the portion of fettucini  alfredo was small  enough that a 9 year old inhaled it in minutes.  Ordered sides of meatballs.  $2 for each meatball the size of a golf balls.  We couldn't believe it.  We also couldn't believe that you have to pay for bread in an italian restaurant! The chocolate cake was divine. There is no question that the food is of a good quality--nothing even close to NY but for Scottsdale it is fine.  Giuseppe's should reconsider the price of those meatballs and making people pay for bread--a staple of any Italian meal. .",

The calamari was uninspired and bland, just sauteed with a thin red sauce and a few frozen peas. Hardly inspiring. The 4 bruschetta were good, with interesting touches like honey and chicken liver, but another tasted like it had plain old strawberry jam on top of mascarpone cheese?  The fettucini carbonara was exceptionally bland and lacked the classic ingredients in abundance like it should including peas. Did they end up in the calamari by mistake ?    The house recommended fresh tagliatelle with bolognese sauce was sad and uninspired and poorly prepared and presented. Really, as a Chef, I found the dish lacking any depth, including the unseasoned meat sauce (6 different meats in the sauce according to the owner, but still lacking any depth, flavor or significant interest). The sauce was mixed into the noodles already and looked very amateurish and very cafeteria-like. A real disappointment overall.     The prices are actually a bit expensive for a strip mall and poor quality. Plastic cups for water, paper napkins for dinner service and piccolo pours of a limited wine selection only added to the lack of value.   Will definitely not return. A disappointing experience that needs attention and correction.",

Yes, the restaurant is small, but that really doesn't matter as all one needs is one table to seat four people. The waiter was full of helpful hints and suggestions as this was our first visit here. After deciding on a bottle of Chianti, we began with a plate of calamari and a side of garlic bread, hmmmm, yummy. Then we all had different main courses--butternut squash ravioli, spaghetti neri, penne al Santa Fe, and penne al salmone. However, two of us switched to the house fresh pasta, which was awesome. If you have only experienced store-bought pasta then you may not be prepared for the wholesome goodness of True homemade pasta. The flavor of each dish was wonderful. We then indulged in dessert. The creme brulee and key lime tart both were excellent (although we were all stuffed by then). The portions were just right and the whole dining experience was awesome.",

Of course I found about this place because of DDD.  Now it is a very intimate little restaurant with no fluff but with excellence service.  Why would not be ok with that if the food is good.  It is not very big on the inside or out but it will be worth any wait that you encounter.  The owner made a point of coming by every table and talking with his customers.  We learned that he played the cello in an orchestra over in Italy and he brought back the amazing recipes he cooks today.  He is an absolute delight to speak with so if you can, make sure you learn about him.    I like to branch out and try other things but that darn bolognese is so good.  It has like six or seven different meats in it.  Really?  I was in heaven.  We also tried the brushcetta, tiramisu, and cannoli. I know that lots of people rave about the osso bucco and that is next on my list.  Darn I think everything is good.   I even saw people getting takeout and the only reason I don't is because I live in the east valley.   I love this place and go back on a regular basis.

All accompanied with a nice Barolo. This spot won't disappoint.",

    "text": "Could not wait to try here after watching on youtube the DDD episode featuring Giuseppe's and have a mixed opinion of the place now that I've finally made it there. The appearance is as described. The place is tiny and the ambiance leaves much to be desired- especially for the type of food prices advertised. This place is a casual eatery with prices/attempts to try to be a gormet restaurant; falling somewhat short.  My wife and I started with the Bruchetta, the bread was nothing to write home about but the toppings were quite tasty and it was well done. She then had the pasta e fagioli soup, which was not quite what we were expecting.  Everywhere else we had had this type of soup, the soup has a more rustic taste, perhaps some meat, a little cheese. This soup tasted like white beans and had no other depth to the flavor.   She had the lasagna and I the house specialty, a pasta with meat sauce. Her lasagna was very rich but the tomato sauce it was served with tasted as though it came from a can which was certainly very disappointing. My pasta was flavorful but again, nothing special. We had the cream brulee for desert which was tasty to me but again was nothing to write home about. For the prices, this restaurant was certainly not worth it.  To add to this restaurant's troubles, the facility can not handle their own limited business. We were offered garlic bread with our meal (which never actually came but was initially on the bill until I noticed it). The table next to us, had the wrong appetizer come out initially and also had one of the main courses come out with the entree. There was only one server who seemed at times overwhelmed with the degree of business at the restaurant. What did not help is there was a time where she literally stood near the kitchen speaking with the manager for about 10 minutes without moving while customers were waiting to be served, or in my case waiting to pay so we could leave.  If I do return, which is far from guaranteed, will be just for their signature dish(es) & will likely be as take out. In summary, the food was fair, but not worth the prices and the ambiance and service left much to be desired.",

Fresh crispy romaine lightly tossed with fresh dressing. Definitely not bottled.  The lasagna, although small in portion, was RICH. It was simple and not overpowered by sausage and frill. The cheese...oh my the cheese! They do not skimp on cheese. Every single fattening cheesy bite was worth it!  It was nice to see the owner in there and he gladly took a picture with our group.

The ravioli was excellent - definitely the highlight of the meal.  The portions are a little small given the price.  For desert we had the flourless chocolate cake with spumoni - an interesting combination.  The flour less cake was like a brownie and it was okay.  The spumoni was very good.  All in all we enjoyed the meal, however I don't think the quality or quantity overall measures up to the prices.  Just the same, we'll probably go back - those ravioli were really good!  One other note, we didn't ask but I'm guessing it was just an usual issue, we were served our drinks (ice tea and sprite) in little plastic cups.",

As a Brooklynite who has been traveling for most of this year, I was happy to discover Giuseppe's is ran just like the old classic pizzerias I'm used to. Rich, the owner, even came over and helped talk to me & my friend, who were traveling through the southwest. That's when I realized he himself was from New York as well! Our server was a sweet, attentive, older woman who knowledgably guided us through the menu. The perfect meal: all the ingredients were fresh ( we enjoyed the mozzarella bursts over prosciutto and arugula // 4 different types of bruschetta // and hand made chicken parm) What a breathe of fresh air! I recommend this place to all locals and tourists alike.",

    "text": "If when you go out for Italian Food and you think that Olive Garden, Buca di Beppo or even Babbo has great Italian Food, Giuseppe's is probably NOT the place for you.   If like me, you grew up thinking that your friend Vinnie's mothers daily offering of Italian Food, with aromas wafting all through the apartment building, was something very special and real Italian Food - THIS IS IT! You will have found Nirvana, as have I!  Until now, I had almost given up hope for what I call \"Old World Italian Food\" prepared with love and the most incredible ingredients available. It is here and being served in a friendly small environment by a knowledgeable and wonderful wait staff.  Not to mention that  the Owner is usually present and generally talks to everyone, making certain that all are satisfied. Now I ask you, is that PRIDE or what?  Based on talking with adjacent Diners, everything on the Menu;  both the \"Today's Menu\" (Changes sometimes daily) and the \"Full Menu,\" seems to be pretty fabulous and receiving \"Rave Reviews\" from my fellow Diners!  Looking at previous Reviews, as well as Guy Fieri's recommendation, I had to have the Bolognese Ragu on my first visit. I have yet to have everything on the menu, but here are the choices I have made on my visits to date and each is NOT to be missed:          Bolognese Ragu - Don't ask! Just order it. Seven meats and homemade           Pasta that lives up to all of the previous fabulous Reviews! Like so many          before me, I am not certain I can eat here ever without having this incredible          dish, which leaves little room for anything else. Share with a friend so you can          have more of their remarkable dishes.          Burrata (Appetizer) - Mozzarella like you have never had. Do NOT overlook it          if  it is available. The description doesn't do it justice, but it is described as          a \"ball of mozzarella filled with shredded mozzarella and cream.\" If you love          Mozzarella -this is \"MOZZARELLA MECCA!\"           Antipasto (Appetizer) - An absolute work of art! Do NOT be fooled by the          Menu designation of Small (they also have Large), it is NOT small, but can be          shared by two (I refuse to share!)  Incredible morsels of meat, cheese and          vegetables, with the proper amount of dressing.          Pasta e Fagioli (Appetizer) - I have a friend who says you can judge ALL          Italian Restaurant by their Pasta e Fagioli. This is a light (meant to be, it's an          Appetizer!) flavorful mixture of beans and pasta that is oh so satisfying, with          just a hint of spice.          Spaghetti and our Famous Meatballs - Not to be confused with your Mothers,          as she probably could not make this rendition. The meatballs in my sampling          were made from Veal with Ricotta and other special ingredients. If spaghetti          and meatballs were like this everywhere, we would all be Italian! Hint - you          can have the meatballs alone as an appetizer or a side dish.          Bread and Olive Oil - Nothing remarkable about the bread here, which is a          surprise, but it is the Olive Oil (with Giuseppe's label on it) that is the star. No          Balsamic needed, just pure goodness with salt and pepper to your own taste.          Take a bottle home (I have!) and pair it with your favorite bread.  Giuseppe's has definitely replaced The Restaurant (Now Pizzeria Bianco) as my favorite Phoenix Italian Restaurant. The love, pride and caring that has gone into each and every dish is more than apparent. There is no need to go elsewhere, unless for a diversion you wish to go to Andreoli Italian Grocer for their bread! Between these two you will be in \"Italian Food Heaven!\"",

I've never actually been inside because I order from them through a delivery service, but I drive past their sign all the time. I order about once or twice a week.  When you order a simple side salad, you don't expect anything really special. But whatever their herbed italian dressing recipe is, it makes a simple side salad special. Plus they are generous with it, and with long but thick carrot shavings, and ample onions. Yum.  Plus you get really soft delicious bread! I love mushing the bread around in the dressing first.   Their gnocchi in vodka sauce is perfect 9 times out of 10. The tenth time it is only slightly less than perfect.  I love restaurants that are consistently good because I am a creature of habit and order the same thing repeatedly. This level of consistently delicious is hard to find.   It is kind of odd being such a huge fan of a place I've never been inside, but man that food is good.",

My boyfriend and I don't eat pork, he ordered a Mac n cheese, and first off it looked disgusting as old hunk, it was literally a block of stall looking max n cheese. He takes a bite and there is ham in there so he spits it out. I get the eggplant parmigiana, and I was not told it came with a side of pasta or I would have exchanged it for a kind of pasta I actually eat. The past they served me was what looked like lasagnas sheets cut into strips, it was to think and not appealing. Their Mariana sauce is good. The eggplant Parmigiana was over salted which I modified by removing the cheese, it felt like a huge waste of money considering each plate is $15. We were brought cold bread and cold butter, not given straws for our water, and told add our own lemonade to our tea to make Arnold Palmer, which was okay I just found weird. We were offered salads but were not told it would $6 each, for dirty soggy salad, it was drenched in their Italian dressing, I could not eat anything but the eggplant after scraping the salty cheese off. I did also eat some cold bread. It seemed the employees were more worried about who's turn it was to have a smoke break instead of actually attending to their customers. All could have been solved if the waitress did her job and explained the menu or if the menu always actually more descriptive. The waitress did notice we were displeased and I believe to ensure her tip or the kindness of her heart gave up a free cannoli. Which I love cannolis, but for what ever reason this one tasted fruity.. which was weird but my bf liked it. $34 down the drain, the lady at back fit recommended us to go there but never again. Place is a joke. I guess they have our lives their recommendation from that  tv host \"guy\" I wonder why things have gone south since 2004? Try it for yourself just make sure you ask a lot of questions about what you are ordering. Towards the end she asked me if I liked my food, I lied so I can hurry out of there without making a scene. If your customer barely touches their food then that's a big indication that they did not like it. She also mention please don't let you stop that from coming back, like we owe the establishment a second chance. I wouldn't eat there if it were free.",

The pasta was soggy and over cooked and the sauce tasted like it came straight out of a can! Tony Soprano would have busted a cap in somebody if this was brought to his table and passed off as authentic italian!

We brought our 4 year old son because Yelp said it was good for kids. When we looked through the menu we didn't see any kids section so we asked the waitress. She said they had Mac and Cheese or spaghetti and meatballs for kids. We proceeded to order the Mac and cheese for him and we ordered the lobster raviolis with brown butter sauce and the lasagne for us. When she brought out the Mac and cheese for our son. It was a full regular order!! And yes they charged us $16.00 for our sons meal!!  What?? The lobster ravioli was drowned in brown butter sauce so much that the raviolis were almost floating! The raviolis were tasty but way too much sauce (pure butter). Also, the Mac and cheese was laying in a pool of butter....really weird. Kind of a heart attack waiting to happen. Although the Mac and cheese was tasty. The lasagne was just ok and nothing to write home about. We won't be back......and I wouldn't advise anyone to bring kids unless you want to share a plate or pay full price for their meal!",

The other servers who brought out the food were also incredibly friendly. They were attentive to refilling our wine and taking away plates. For appetizers we got the burrata, which was a soft mozzarella sitting in a bed of arugula with prosciutto and balsamic vinegar, garlic bread, and calamari. Burrata was delicious, the flavors complimented each other perfectly. I will pass on the garlic bread in the future, it was nothing special and could have used more butter and garlic. I can't say a lot about the calamari as I'm not a fan of it in general.  For my main course I ordered a pasta with broccolini and sausage. It had a lot of green stuff in it which was great! The sausage was slightly spicy which I didn't like. Next time I will go more basic with what I order - like lasagna.  I was really impressed with this tiny little restaurant! Will definitely become my husband and I's go-to Italian spot.",

This mom and pop Italian far cuisine is absolutely to die for and it will not cost you an arm and a leg to treat yourself to one of the best experiences in The Valley of the Sun.   The staff is attentive and welcoming (which is needed after a long day of business travel from out of town), the atmosphere was relaxing, the way we romanticize eating Italian food in a neighborhood piazza. It is a small and intimate setting. I dined alone but several parties of friends and families were tucked into tables in the dining room very comfortably.   I think next time I come, I will bring a special someone and recommend the black ink pasta. This dish looks absolutely beautiful, and with the seafood variety that came with the pasta, I thought I was eating just a few miles from the sea. The wines were a perfect pairing to the food which I will be dreaming about until my next return.",

The watermelon salad I ordered, which, by my mistake of thinking it was a salad with greens, was cubed watermelon, 4 olives and a hint of shredded mint. (I couldn't find the feta which was supposed to be on it) I asked for chicken to be added. It came with a few very thin limp cold pieces of shredded chicken. The pasta dish my boyfriend ordered was over cooked and salty. The soup he ordered had very little flavor too.  We asked about the Yelp check-in complimentary glass of wine with an entree and said we both had one. He said no problem and then told us what wine he was going to bring us as though there wasn't a choice. When the check came there was an $8.50 charge for one of the glasses. I got a little attitude going, stating had I known that I would not have accepted the wine he brought. He did take the charge off the bill, which was appreciated.  The service was decent but the atmosphere was minimal. It reminded me of a simple pizza joint, however, the prices were not reflective of that. Overpriced in my opinion.  Would I return? No.",

They were just opening for dinner service at the time, so we were the only table in the restaurant. The space overall is small, and can seem crowded, with tables being very close together, practically touching, so the fact we were the only party was a good thing.   When you walk in you will see a lunch counter type situation in the front of the restaurant. We were thinking you order at the counter, then pick up your food from there. That is not the case, after inquiring about the set up, we were pleasantly informed they will come to your table to take your order.  The service was pretty good, however the food was not the greatest. My Mom ordered spaghetti and meatballs, while I ordered the lasagna. Both were priced accordingly, however they both were lacking flavor, and they tasted as if they were previously frozen, not fresh.   Overall, this was just ok, certainly not great. This restaurant was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, I personally do not see any of the hype. An average Italian spot, not the best.",

    "text": "Seeing the \"As seen on...\" as I walked by this place, I laughed and immediately had to try it as a novelty. As I walked in to order to-go there was an elder couple sitting outside enjoying their pasta.   The waiter was extremely nice and gave me a brief overview of the menu after he was informed it was my first time. He made a few suggestions and left me to decide on a dish. While I was searching, the couple outside started to tell me that the beet pasta was their all time favorite dish. I saw the lady eating it - it was gorgeous! She said it can't be beet.   I ended up with a classic to gage their level of deliciousness: the Alfredo. It's cooked to order with fresh noodles and sauce. That being said, it took a little extra to cook so the waiter offered me a glass of wine with his apologies. I politely declined as I had to drive a half hour home.   When I got home to eat this in bed (just being honest), it was as if I was transported back to my grandma's chicken noodle soup. The noodles were out of this world. The Alfredo sauce was a bit watery from getting takeout so I'd highly recommend ordering and eating there as opposed to take-out. Nevertheless, it was one of the best Italian dishes I've had in the valley. You have to go into it with the mindset of hearty Midwestern meets Italian and you'll be satisfied.   The meals are large enough to be split family style or shared on a date. Next time I'll certainly sit down for a glass of wine and enjoy the experience.",

Researched heavily on Yelp and Triple D and came down to this one little Italian restaurant.  Work friend and I agreed we had to try the two dishes highlighted on DDD; 5 meat bolognese with homemade pasta and Osso Bucco. First started with a salad with fresh mozzarella, pesto, tomatoes, basil. Wow it was so fresh, so amazing. The waiter suggested we get the bolognese sauce with a special homeade pasta that was filled with ricotta but yet light and airy and smaller than a penne but not hollow. Very unique softness to it and it was just incredible with this meat sauce.   Second I have to say I would not typically order osso bucco but since it was highlighted on the show as a melt in your mouth good, I couldn't resist. This night it was made with veal shank. This was three huge veal shanks that filled the entire plate with a homeade lingini pasta with ruffled edges like lasagna noodles and this wonderful dark rich tomato/wine flavor sauce that was just amazing by itself. Wow you literally did not have to chew this meat and I am not exaggerating!   We were just awestruck over the flavors of these dishes, the cozy environment and the amazing friendliness of the restaurant. The owner came over several times to ask us how we liked it and we both were so impressed with the customer service overall.  To top it off, our amazing waiter was nice enough to save us the last caramel gelato with praline pecans crunched up small, OMG so smooth, sweet and perfect! I cannot wait to bring my other work associates here when I come back to Phoenix in a couple of weeks!",

Giuseppe's is tiny; there are a few tables outside and maybe only three times as many inside.  You order and pay at the counter and sit wherever you'd like.  The menu is written on chalkboards above and beside the counter and is pretty extensive.  From bruschetta to salads, sandwiches to pasta, the place has everything.  Alcohol is not served, but Giuseppe's is BYOB. I have never not seen the dark-haired lady at the counter.  I'm not sure if she's the owner, but she is very friendly and warm.  I have enjoyed on multiple occasions their gnocchi with Cardinale sauce (a mixture of red and alfredo) and today, for the first time, the meatball sandwich.  Both are wonderful and the sandwich is very filling!  If you ask, you can even get a basket of crusty bread and butter before your meal (free at lunch, $3 at dinner).  Prior to today's visit, I hadn't been to Giuseppe's in at least two years. I definitely won't wait that long before my next visit!",

This place definitely had some positives and has the potential to be a four star place, but there were a few things that brought it down for me. I will start with the positive: the gnocchi was good, and the recommendation to add asparagus was spot on, the marinara was also pretty good and the bf liked his chicken parm. On to the negative: our server was very nice, but he disappeared for about 15 minutes while we were waiting for the check. When he returned, he said he had to answer the phones but he smelled like he had been taking a smoke break...not cool. We got their rice balls for an app and they were less than stellar....kind of soggy, not crispy like other arancini. Overall, the food was tasty and if the service was a little better, i could see giving 4 stars, but for now it is just ok, but I would give it another chance in the future.",

Only thing was this place is pretty pricey. 4 pasta dishes ran us around $60+ and two were only half orders.

I have given them the benefit of the doubt and eaten here a couple of times after the Guy visit. Every time it has gotten worse. I would much rather go to La Piazza Al Forno.

The lasagna used to be really good here but the last 3 times it has gotten smaller and costs more and the flavor is disappearing with the portion size. Overall to pricey for what you get.   Again that sign is just plain old tacky and is enough of a reason to make me go elsewhere. In my opinion a stupid move. Maybe Gordon Ramsey should visit and give Giuseppe a much needed reality check!",

If you're expecting a five star hotel then you're going to the wrong place. If you are a True foody and love hole in the wall-owner serves you-best italian food in AZ type places then this is your place.  The bruchetta is AMAZING. I don't know where they get their tomotoes, but I would gladly give a whole month's salary to find out.  The Bolognese Ragu is so so so good. I can't order anything else. My husband always gets the chicken parmsean with the homemade pasta and it's to die for. I think the prices are right for what you're getting. I would gladly pay $200 for the bolegnese ragu.  The desserts are amazing as well. All I can say is if you love food and your in this area GO.",

I enjoyed the homemade Buffalo Mozzarella which came with arugula, pesto and Prosciutto and Balsamic. It comes with french bread and the waitress brought garlic bread as a free upgrade. The dish was absolutely fresh and delicious.   I had the Tagliatelle Bolognese for main course. The homemade pasta was toothsome and perfectly cooked and the flavors of the sauce was so amazing. Our server could not have been more pleasant and we were NOT rushed at all even though it is such a small restaurant and many people waiting.  Only knock and it's not that big a deal, but the wine list could be improved. I had craft beer with my meal and was very satisfied.                As an aside, I kept noticing people taking 5 gal. water bottles next door and leaving with the water and ice cream cones?? Turns out there is a business next door that provides reverse osmosis water, AND services Thrifty ice cream. Yummm.            I was in town for Cubs spring training. If I come back next year I will absolutely visit Giuseppe's again!",

There are tons of reviews on here that pretty much cover everything, but here are some points to consider:  * Water is served in plastic cups * Soda comes from the can so there are no refills ($3 for a can!) * The bread is 'eh and costs you $3 * the bruschetta is just ok * The fresh mozzarella is awesome * The pasta is fresh and delicious * The tiramisu is fresh, fluffy, creamy and delicious  The best part about this place is the owner, Richard Bock.  Although he jokes around and is super friendly, you can tell he knows what he is doing when it comes to his food and his restaurant.  From the prices he charges to the way he pushes the higher priced menu items, you can tell he is a sucker for the bottom line.  I admit I am one of those people who is all into going to places featured on TV, especially DDD so this place was on my list.  It didn't hurt either that there was a 50% off certificate on Local Dines ( <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FdfR4eQ&s=74666453fa5eb2cd84c02c6801a501dcfbd893c7f5f3b7db84551161c61ab246\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/dfR4eQ</a> ).

I am quite surprised because I usually do a good job of being informed of great places and I've probably eaten at 5-6 other Italian places all within 5 miles of that place.  I digress again...  Anyways, I've been a couple of times now.  For lunch and for dinner.  The sandwiches offered at lunch are both tasty and reasonably priced.  They are not notably unique in any way but the quality is present.  The pastas served at dinner were more distinguished.  The bolognese is the second best in Phoenix behind Pinos.  The Osso Buco gets a lot of attention and rightfully so.  The service has been above par on both visits.  All told a great neighborhood place to eat, if you live or work in the neighborhood.  Just not quite good enough to merit the trek by itself.",

My father, being the martyr that he is, decided he didn't want to go to dinner for his 55th birthday. So after some hemming and hawing, I bullied him into it. The next question, Where do we go? I told him about this recent episode of Triple D and to my amazement he had seen it to and suddenly he was all happy about a birthday dinner.   Like most places nowadays, they don't take reservations. My brother called ahead and was told it should be fine for our time for a table of 8, a Wednesday night mind you. We were seated and take everyone else's word if not mine, the restaurant is small(read:TINY). There are probably 12 tables, max. We were given menus quickly and had our drink orders taken and brought out promptly. The table started with a mixed bruschetta of a traditional tomato and basil and a pesto with tomato. Both were excellent. They have a bunch of other choices as well. We also had the caprese salad, fresh balls of mozzarella, tomatoes, and romaine covered in balsamic vinegar. This too was great.   Dinner choices were varied. I had a fettuccine with chicken, green chilies, and sun dried tomato. It had a garlic-wine sauce. Sprinkle on a little red pepper flakes for a little extra heat and you'll be happy. Get the fresh pasta, pay the extra buck, and you'll be one smiling mother#$*&er! Fresh pasta makes a world of difference. I sampled everything at the table. The macaroni and cheese with prosciutto, the ravioli, and the penne with sausage. The regular plain old red pasta sauce they use is great! It had such a nice sweetness to it I could have had a bowl of it.  Get the mac & cheese.  It is baked to perfection!  We aren't talking Kraft mac and cheese here either people.  This has real cheese, not some powder cheese.  We also indulged in dessert and coffee. The flour-less chocolate cake with vanilla bean gelato was delicious. The cappuccino was great too. I was told the key lime cheesecake was good as well.   The dining experience was nice. I thought the prices were reasonable and the serving size ample. We spoke with the owner, Richard, for long stretches throughout the meal and he was very personable and answered any questions or gave suggestions on meals. He saw me taking a picture of my food and asked if this was going to be on Yelp! I assured him it would be. He told me I wasn't getting anything free because of it, with a smile and a laugh. Love the NY attitude.   For those that gave a bad review, I'm sorry, but I just don't get it. NO other Italian restaurants in the valley use fresh pasta, maybe Pasta Brioni. So, if you thought Buca, Olive Garden(barf), or Macaroni Grill used it, you are sadly mistaken.",

I should have known something was up when the server told me the plate was hot. I wondered why it would be hot if they just placed the food on it. After my first bite it hit me. They served me a prepackaged, frozen breaded chicken filet, canned marinara sauce, a couple pieces of cheese on top and microwaved it!!!!!!! I believe it was mozzarella, no parmigiana to be found. That was why the plate was hot. It just came out of the microwave. The cheese was stuck to the plate!! All for the low, low price of $27.00. When asked how it was, I told them I did not appreciate canned sauce, frozen prepackaged chicken, and microwaved food. I prefer it was fresh. His response...\"you could have asked for something else\". This comment from the same server who responded to my son in laws question of how spicy was a dish with, \"I can't answer that because it is too broad of a question. I like spicy so it might not be spicy to me, where you might not like it very spicy.\"  Very lame answer from a very, very bad restaurant. I would not feed their food to my dog!!!! STAY AWAY!!!!",

Everything is homemade and very good. The lasagna was fresh and so were the raviolis. Prices were also reasonable.  Love and support the local independent restaurants. We will definitely come back.",

    "text": "We went to Scottsdale area for spring break last week, so I looked up restaurants on my \"Flavortown\" app, that show where Guy has reviewed (Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives).  Found this and told hubby we had to try it out one night.  We got there at about 5:45 or so on a Monday or Tuesday night - figuring no wait. We were wrong. It was already full (small, only maybe 10-12 tables inside), so put name on the list.  We waited maybe 20 minutes or so.  Worth the wait.  I got the pasta bolognese that they showed on the show. Delicious sauce with fresh, tender pasta.  Hubby and son got the chicken parm, their usual.  I was hoping hubby would try to osso buco so I could try that too, but oh well.  Daughter had fettucini alfredo. They liked their meals too.  They DO serve wine here now - so that must have changed since some of the past reviewers said it was BYOB.  We also had their fresh, homeade pink lemonade. LOVED it. Wow - fresh with some type of herb in it that was so good.  Glad we made the trip here after the afternoon spring training baseball game. A bit pricy I guess - for 4 of us, with just one glass of wine, I think we made it out for just under $90.  Friendly staff and it's a well-oiled machine. They'll take good care of you.",

We made an online reservation at 6:55pm, and upon arriving at the restaurant at 725pm, we noticed a sign-in sheet outside. Since no one was there, we walked into the restaurant and asked the man behind the counter if we had a reservation if we needed to sign-in. He first asked me if we called. We told him no, we had made the reservation through OpenTable. He looked at his phone and scoffed and said we made it 10 minutes ago. I was not sure of the relevance of his comment, so I corrected him and said I made the reservation before 7pm. He just looked at me and said they were full and we'll be seated when something becomes available.  I understand restaurants go through ebbs and flows, but why use a technology if you can't handle it, and there is no excuse for being rude. We were referred here, but will never return.",

Wife enjoyed a nice, free glass of red wine form the Yelp check in coupon.  Settled on a couple entrees but immediately after we ordered, long time waitress returned to inform us there was another special, just finished, not on the board, and not told to us before: shrimp scampi over polenta.  i immediately opted for that while spouse stuck with the chicken parmigiana.  Was not disappointed as it was an interesting and different departure from the traditional Italian fare.  Owner/chef came by a couple times to get feedback and ensure we enjoyed our meals.  Been going there for over 30 years and would love for them to be there for another 30.",

I had the lasagna tonight, which literally melted in my mouth and was probably the best lasagna I've ever eaten.  I also ate some of the shrimp scampi.  You could tell the noodles were homemade, and I might have literally licked my plate at one point.  The portions are perfectly-sized (not too small where you feel you're paying fancy restaurant prices for a couple of nibbles of food, not too large that you feel like you have to skip out on dessert and are too bloated and need to get rolled out of the restaurant by your waiter).  We had desserts for the first time tonight, and I really enjoyed both the flourless chocolate cake (hot and topped with some excellent ice cream) and the key lime tart.  I was full by the end of the night, but the food was so good that I would have eaten it all over if someone put it in front of me again.  We also met the owner who was incredibly friendly and really loves food - he spent ten years in Florence and knows his stuff!!!  Can't wait to come back again!  Perfect place for a date night.",

It's obvious Rich has a passion for what he does, and it shows in both his words and his cooking.  Most of the menu is homemade and offers both classic and gourmet Italian dishes.

Usually I just love the Osso Buco but this time it seemed as if it was a little fattier and greasier than usual.

The chicken was simmered in water or boiled and had an odd flavor, to no flavor. Then it was topped with red sauce and cheese, but you could still taste the odd chicken flavor. In other words, the sauce and cheese couldn't help it. The red sauce and pasta is flavorful. I've had the eggplant parmesan before, it's better than the chicken. The waiter has been there a long time and is amazing at providing service. She waits all of the tables and is able to get everything right. I felt bad for her because Giuseppe was angry with her about something and made himself look like a tyrant of sorts, which is NOT good for customers to see. This place is very small and it would have been hard to miss his temper tantrum. She took it all in stride however...so because of her, we'll be back for another try.",

When we arrived the staff was extremely friendly. They were very attentive and able to suggest a very nice bottle of wine, that was really good. The food is outstanding. The homemade pasta is delicious and prepared very well, a nice al dente. The bruschetta appetizer was fresh and tasty. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food you receive.

I observe everything and am easily turned off by lack of love towards employees, food, or people. This place is about an hour away from me and hard to get to due to my work schedule clashing with their opening hours. I am always short on free time but always make sure I can eat here whenever I have the slightest time to spare. I would drive four hours to eat here as it is my favorite place to be in the entire world. The atmosphere is calm, slithering, accepting, vintage, beautiful, romantic, playful, wonderful. Along with a happy staff who has been working for years here and know your name by heart every time you come back. They have memorized what I like to eat as well! The owner is fantastic and makes sure to ask EVERY person how their meal and experience is-even when every table is filled. The food is made with pure love and joy. No other place on earth could capture the precious feeling of home this restaurant gives me. This is where I come to enjoy a memory and meal with the closest people in my life as I share it with those who I feel truly deserve a taste of my secret magical world. This place is where j come to eat before a flight out of state I case it's my last meal. This place is where I come to run and hide from the mess of my world. And I always leave feeling like tomorrow can be better because my spaghetti said so. I will never stop coming here. It has a piece of my heart and always will. If the owner sees this, please know how much your restaurant means to me and how it makes me feel. Thank you so much for giving me a safe haven.",

The \"ch\" is pronounced like a hard \"k.\" Our server nailed it.) I had the osso buco which was fantastic. Homemade pasta came with it and the sauce had a nice bit of heat. Barry had the pasta carabonara. He was torn between that and the Bolognese and the waiter said \"want me to surprise you?\" And Barry said yes.  We each took about half home but managed to finish by splitting a cannoli made with fresh ricotta. Really excellent.",

    "text": "Despite the media spotlight, I had not heard of Giuseppe's on 28th until Monday night.  With time to kill and looking to fill my stomach I asked for a recommendation from a bartender and he sent me to Giuseppe's.  I found a small restaurant in a shopping center.  My guess is this place is packed and stuffy if you go at a peak hour.  I was there before 5pm so only a few of the tables were occupied.  The waitress was prompt with menus and drinks.  Friendly too.  Bolognese Ragu was my dinner selection.  The sound of homemade pasta is sauce and six meats sounded fantastic.  I was given a basked of fresh Italian bread while I awaited my dish.  The bread was fresh and tasty (from a local bakery according to the website).  I am partial to oven fresh bread so I was slightly disappointed at first but, hey, you can't always have it 100% to your taste.  I was very impressed with the ragu.  Granted, I have nothing else to compare it with but I loved it.    So, why only 3 stars?  I'd like to give 3.5 but I can't so it gets 3.  The prices were not satisfactory.  The ragu and a can of coke came out to over $21 with tax.  For the price I paid I found the portion a bit small and $3 for a can of Coke is lunacy.  I understand a local restaurant needing to charge more but I think they could shave some of the cost off.  Especially on the pop.  To be honest, the prices will keep me away for a bit.  I'd love to try more of the menu but I can't afford to eat here too often.  One day, though, I will return.  If money is of know object to you, knock 'em dead and have a great dinner.",

As another reviewer noted, there are pictures and signs and placards and flyers galore of Guy Fieri.  It's a little funny and off putting at the same time.  My colleague had the sausage and pepper sandwich and I had the bolognese.  Both were excellent and both were pricey ($40 for the two of us including tip).  I definitely want to try other things on their menu like the chicken or eggplant parm but maybe I'll make him pick up the tab next time.  Hahaha...J/K Joe!

The same staff is always there, including the owner. Service is typically straight forward and gets the job done.  To me, its all about the fresh pasta. I can't seem to steer away from the Bolognese ragu. Its actually pretty light with long pasta and ground meats (7 different kinds?)   My wife usually goes with the gnocchi, which she raves about as well. We tried the bruschetta, definitely go for the fig, goat and prosciutto.  The wine list is very fair. Most bottles are 90+ and around $30-$40.  2 critical thoughts: Remove the \"As seen on Dives, Diners and Drive-ins\" on the front sign, let the food stand it for itself. Add fresh grated parmesan instead of the store bought pizza shakers.    Overall, a big fan of this place. Not going to impress a hot date with the ambiance, and can get loud due to small size, but its simply all about the food.",

It's a very small restaurant with just a handful of tables. So expect to be in close quarters with other dining guests. The menu isn't very large but they have quite an extensive list of some Italian staples. I started my meal with prosciutto & melon. The melon was fresh and super sweet the prosciutto was tough almost as if it had been refrigerated for a long time. I also ordered a side of Sicilian olives, that weren't seasoned. The black Olives seemed old, only the green ones were fresh... The Server brought us bread and butter and then butter came in these little plastic cups with foil lids, like the kind you get at hotels... for an Italian joint I expected much better bread and butter.. i had a bowl of pasta fagioli soup that was okay... it needed more beans and pasta, there was more broth than veggies & pasta... and a glass of wine that was amazing... I was a tad disappointed in this joint... I think I'm their \" hay day \" things were probably much better than now but you can definitely tell this joint is just trying to stay afloat. They had a decent lunch crowd and the service was really good... I want to like this place so I'll try it again for dinner instead of lunch and what it's like. I'm giving one start for efforts and another for service...",

    "text": "I have mixed reactions about this restaurant, and I will get to that point here shortly.  I just want to dispense with some of the quibbles that I read from other reviewers. The price of the food is what it is. Personally, it's irrelevant to me as the value derived is personal and perceived. Therefore, if a patron says that it is too much, then according to their standards, the food isn't worth the price paid.  lt may be very different for you.  Next, this restaurant occupies a very small space in a strip mall. I know that some locals prefer a more spacious establishment. I didn't think it was negative. Having eaten in Little Italy in NYC, where space is at a premium, this actually wasn't bad at all.   Before I get to my review, I learned a bit about the history of the restaurant that I wanted to share.   The story goes that Richard, the owner, used to be the lead Cellist for the Phoenix Symphony. When he was studying his craft in Italy, he became deeply involved in the culinary arts. So, when he returned to the USA, he decided to hang up his craft and opened this restaurant.  This place had the honor of being featured in the Food Network, as their sign says. I was unaware of this fact until arriving here. It was interesting but I decided this shouldn't color my review. I barely watch TV and I have never watched any shows on the Food Network, in any case.   So with the history out of the way, let me move on to the review.  The food here is excellent. I ordered the Veal Osso Bucco, and my wife ordered the Ravioli Quartet. My friends ordered the Bolognese Ragu with 7 Meats, and the Lasagna. Amongst all of us, we had a great cross-section of foods to try amongst ourselves.  The veal shank that I had was tremendous. It was very lean and fall-off-the-bone tender. The gremolata, along with the sauce and the pasta were simply a home run combination.  My friend had me sample his 7 meat Bolognese Ragu, and it had a wonderful combination of flavors that were both hearty and very rich.  The Lasagna and the Ravioli were also amazing, along with their accompanying rich sauces.  Speaking of very rich, our Flourless Chocolate Cake, and their signature Tiramisu was absolutely rich and delightful!  The only thing we weren't particularly fond of was the calamari, which we ordered for an appetizer along with two orders of french bread  It was interesting, more like a soup than an appetizer, but not what we were expecting. We were expecting a deep fried calamari.   Aside from that, what also wasn't delightful was the service. It was a busy Saturday night, and the kitchen was overwhelmed by the number of patrons. The place was packed, both inside and at the patio.  They were so busy that they gave our friends' order to newly arrived guests who just happened to order the same main courses. Since we were seated by the kitchen, we got to hear the entire ordeal. Mind you, we'd already been there for an hour. Earlier, when we got our food, our second French bread order was not served, and we had to ask for it to be brought more than once.   All in all, it was still a great get-together with our longtime friends before they departed on their holiday trip. It's too bad that the whole experience was mired in the service aspect of our visit.",

Finally after rejecting a few of our orders he informed us that someone hadn't come in that day and so 80% of the salad and appetizer menus were unavailable.  So we went ahead and just ordered entrees. I got the bolognese and while it tasted good, the temperature was incredibly uneven. Parts of it were warm and parts cold and parts room temperature, as if it had been microwaved and not even stirred after.  While it isn't the worst place I've been, there are way too many good Italian restaurants in the same price range within a few blocks of there for it to be worth going back",

I used uber eats and ordered the Italian Mac and Cheese Entree. For $16 I thought it would be a complete meal. I also opted in for the gluten free option of pasta and after a few seconds of placing my order they called to say they it was already made up and couldn't pick gluten free pasta. Why not take it off the options then? Then it showed up at my door and what I got was a tiny portion and 4 slices of regular bread. The entire entree was the size of a side So I would only recommend it if you are not very hungry. Maybe the portions for delivery are smaller? I'm not sure. But the dish was delicious just surprised at the portion for the price.",

The portion sizes were HORRIBLE.   The value compared to the portion size was not worth the 20min Drive we took to get there.  I understand that the food network raves about this place, but perhaps they were comped on the price and portions were maybe escalated when they were put on TV.  The staff were very nice and they often asked if we needed anything.  I was honestly compelled to say, it would be nice if there was more food on the plate!!  Just remember to bring your pocketbook if you want to get full.  A $50-60 bill didn't come close to filling us up.    All I can say is that we were disappointed.",

I used to make ziti myself (before work took over my life) and theirs is definitely better than mine. There's a hint of heat in the sauce, which is a nice touch and just the right amount of ricotta and mozzarella.   The other thing I really enjoy is they bring bags of sliced bread, with the olive oil and spices. There's natural lemon in the oil for dipping with the bread and the bread is super soft with a nice crust. Not only is it the best bread side out of all the restaurants we order from, but it's really easy to eat ...no messy tearing the bread or tough chewing (which if you're at work are things to consider).  Now if only I had the metabolism of a 19-year old male swim champion!",

(5/5 in quality for food)  Wild boar ragu was slightly too oily and salty for my taste. Setting is a bit cramped for the high caliber of the food.

We were seated then ignored for about 10 mins.  We started to look at yelp and looking for other options as we were ready to just leave since we weren't being served.  The manager picked up on our conversation and proceeded to tell his wait staff to get over to us NOW.  We finally got a waitress, and proceeded to order.  First of all they charge for bread.  Regular or garlic.  Which is fine. But they offer it like it's free and then there is the fact that it is stale and awful.  The portions were small.  The flavor was eh.  And the service was bad.  I also noticed the manager cleaning a table, putting his fingers in the dirty glasses, then going over and making roll ups of silver ware.  I watched as he touched the tongs on the forks with his dirty hands.  That alone is reason enough for me to NEVER go back.  Basically just an awful experience.

If when you think Italian you think Olive Garden or Old Spaghetti Factory, get ready for something special.  We were seated outside on a warm spring evening.  A watermelon salad with olives and feta and garlic bread started us out.  We found that although there is a daily menu that if you don't get there early it sells out.  So I didn't get the short-rib goulash I so much wanted.  Instead I had the Bolognese ragu which was amazing.  The home-made pasta  made the dish.  My wife had lobster ravioli in a tomato cream sauce that was equally decadent.  Too much food for dessert, although that menu was very tempting.  Dinner and two glasses of wine topped $60.00 but was well worth it.  Service was exceptional",

The portions aren't exactly what you'd expect for the fares. Apparently the entrees don't even include a side of bread or a salad, but who knows. Maybe we were supposed to get the bread, but they were just too busy? Bruchetta toppings were weak. All in all the food is pretty good, but they have quite a few things to work on here. Took notice to a few other things, but no need to mention them. Coin toss if I'd return any time soon. Ciao!",

Both dishes we ordered were tasteless -- adding cheese on top did not help.  The dish I ordered was a mushroom \"stew\" over ravioli dough.  The second time I found myself chewing something very gritty, I called the waitress over and told her the food either had sand or broken glass in it. I gave her a piece of the grit I had taken out of my mouth and, after a long examination by the owner & staff, the owner said he thought it was crystallized sugar.  I think it was dirty mushrooms.  Regardless, I then replaced that dish with pasta fagioli, a little greasy with  90% broth.  Not good. The avocado/tomato salad was delicious.  However, I thought an owner who wanted return business would have comped my meal or, at the least, have offered free coffee or dessert.  Nope!  I will not be back.",

    "text": "I had a hard time finding this restaurant to review it because at first I thought it was called As Seen on Food Network....but I found it so on with the review. My wife first introduced me to this place by bringing it home one night for dinner. It was horrible; but I chalked this up to what I ordered (a dish that was a cross between Mexican and Italian food) and the fact that it was cold from the drive home. So when we were in the area we decided to go in and sit down for a meal and enjoy the atmosphere. Well enjoy I did...nothing says a nice night out to dinner like tables covered with paper and plastic cups for you can drink (don't adjust your screen; this is not a review for Peter Piper Pizza). But hey, I am not a snob; I love places that save on the little things so they can put it in the food. But sadly this was not the case; it was not the worst Italian I have ever had, I am old enough to remember Wendy's super bar with fettuccine alfredo and hamburger bun bottoms cut in half and slathered in garlic butter. But for the price and the hype it was strike two; I had a Caesar salad and a pasta in cream sauce; both decent portions but nothing to write home about in the end. The service was poor, we did not get the specials but luckily we heard it given to the table beside us (just not lucky enough to have this happen before we ordered). We also ordered bread with our entrees but it never came out. I think my wife summed up our service experience best when she said that at the very least she expected the waiter to pour her can Coke into her plastic cup for her. The bill came and I found myself paying top dollar for mediocre food and poor service; strike three, ball game.",

    "text": "We had dinner at this establishment last night (Saturday, January 18th)!  We live right around the corner, this was our first visit, and we absolutely LOVED it!  Best Italian food I have had since Italy and Boston's North End  We were told there was a 30 minute wait, but we were seated in about 15.  The pasta made me especially happy as it was perfectly done, not overcooked, and for whatever reason NO ONE MAKES IT HOW THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO!  Ok, rant over  We had the melazana (thin sliced eggplant appetizer) which was perfect. I've never had better. We also shared a bruschetta sample and the one with chicken liver pate was especially terrific! My fiance had pasta with salmon and asparagus and I had the wild boar ragu.  Both were delicious.  Our tab came in at under $65.00 and we also had four Americanos.  The service was a little scattered, but just fine for such a busy time of night.  Part of this places charm is the East Coast matter-of-fact attitude and banter of the entire staff:  owner and waitstaff.  My fiance and I have been searching for a little romantic restaurant to call \"our place\" and this is definitely it.  We sat on the beautiful little patio and enjoyed the unseasonably warm January weather (space heaters were provided).  it doesn't feel stuffy or pretentious and I didn't have to dress up (which is rare for such a high quality meal).  Thank you so much for a wonderful evening!  We can't wait to go back and try different menu items.",

The restaurant was empty when we arrived and I was surprised how small the restaurant is. The guy behind the counter told us to take a seat so we did. We sat there for about 10 minutes and nothing. Do we order at the counter? My sister told me to ask but the guys behind the counter didn't even understand me when I asked if they had a restroom. Finally someone came over and asked what we wanted to drink and placed our order. We started out with the bruschetta, garlic bread, and some kind of cheesy pasta balls that were not very flavorful. The bruschetta was great and the garlic bread was good too. I asked for a side of marinara to dip my garlic bread in and it was really good. I am still daydreaming about that marinara sauce. Mmmm! My sister ordered spaghetti and meatballs, I ordered spaghetti carbonara with pancetta and egg, and the birthday girl ordered tortellini alfredo. Their portions were very small compared to my dish and I felt kind of bad. It looked like they got the kiddie portion! Despite the skimpy portions and spotty service everything tasted homemade and delicious.",

We didn't know that the restaurant closed at 9 PM, so at about 9:20 PM we walked in on saturday night to a packed restaurant.  I asked the owner if they were closed, he told us to hold on while he checked with the kitchen... a minute later he had us seated... we were very grateful!  I moved to AZ about 5 years ago from NJ, where in my opinion some of the best italian food is...I have not found a good italian restaurant in AZ until now... I ordered an osso bucco that sat on top of homemade pasta.  OMG, so good, It was a very generous portion and the meat separated from the bone with a fork.. delicious and $19.. How can you beat that?  Osso bucco, whether beef, pork or lamb anywhere else will cost you at least $30... We also ordered a calamari appetizer that was swimming in a tasty gravy which we dipped garlic bread in... the gravy was extra tasty as well.. My partner ordered a bolognese sauce over home made noodles... the bolognese had 6-7 cured meat in it, which made for a nice meaty flavor... could have used more garlic but was nonetheless delicious.  We were too full to try any desserts but the tiramisu looked great and I will definitely be back to try that.  The owner made it a point to come over and have a conversation with us.  He is from NY and takes pride in the food they make.  Some other reviews have commented that the food network sign they have in front is a little much... perhaps, but they are a small business and I don't think there is anything wrong in taking advantage of the fact that they are good enough to be featured on that network.  I would have never found this gem if it weren't for seeing it on the show... Thanks again, and I can't wait to be back!!",

My wife and I both ordered the Capellini with meat ball and a basket of bread. The bread was really disappointing, we could get better bread at the bakery in any grocery store, definitely not Italian bread. The Capellini was so so, the meat sauce was very bland with no destinctive flavor of any kind, very disappointing. We are used to going to St. Louis and eating on the Hill section where the neighborhood is famous for great little Italian spots. Back home we had a nice little four star Italian spot called Paparazzi's, and no one has ever come even close to there quality and service, anyone ever visiting Peoria Illinois needs to try this place if they want top notch Italian food.  Our bill was $40 with tip, rather high for the quality of food, service and atmosphere we experienced.",

I come here about 3-4 times a month to get my Italian fix:) The staff is super friendly and treats you like your family. The owner, Richard, is often there and loves to talk so get ready for a great conversation about the history of the restaurant etc!  Its a very small restaurant and seating is limited. I personally like sitting inside because its warm and cozy! There is outside seating but it looks out onto a shopping center parking lot which to me is not appealing to me at all. The food here is AMAZING! Portions are quite large and can easily be spit in half to share. They have been on the TV show Diner, Drive-ins and Dives, which is where I got my motivation to make the drive over there. I would recommend the calamari to start and/or the bruschetta, which offers 4 choices of toppings. For the main course I always get the Spagetti Neri, which is squid ink pasta with a TON of seafood. If you like seafood this is definitely the dish for you! The Bolognese is also an excellent choice. To top it off at the end of my meal I like to take a conolli, which is always made fresh and oh so yummy!",

We started with an appetizer of Calimari, sauteed in white wine and saved in a red sauce, along with garlic bread. The Calimari was tender and tasty and the garlic bread was great.   Mom had the Butternut Squash Ravioli, which she loved. Dad had the special, shrimp and arugula with linguine in a red sauce. He said it was excellent.  I had the Spaghetti Neri, squid ink pasta with Calimari, shrimp and clams in red sauce. The squid ink pasta was black, but tasted very delicate and appealing. The seafood was done well and it all came together exquisitely.   Pros: Great food, friendly staff  Cons: Small space with only a handful of tables.",

Disappointed in the chicken parmigiana however, and the accompanying pasta marinara.  The homemade tagliatelle is excellent, but the marinara sauce was way too acidic for us.  Is it me tho, or does anyone else find the portions extremely small?  At first I thought it was decently priced, then when I saw the plate with barely anything on it, I felt ripped off.  I could have eaten twice the amount of pasta and I don't eat much pasta typically.  Maybe that's a testimonial of how good it was, but I see it as a sign of how small it was.  Also, the place is very small to the point of being uncomfortable, as your conversation can be heard in almost the whole restaurant.  I don't think I'll be back, even though the menu was very appealing to me.",

It's a very small place, Very Small. Cozy.   Lots to choose from on their chalkboard menu, we were greeted upon entry and told to come up and order when we were ready.  We ordered a ceaser salad, the Risotto Balls, Delicious balls of risotto with mozzarella cheese inside then lightly rolled in bread crumbs and fried with a side of marinara. Fresh Pasta Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken and Gnocchi with Tomato Cream Sauce.  I thought the prices seemed a little high, but honeslty after tasting the food I didnt care.  First of all everything came out piping HOT, including other diners dishes, you could see the steam rising throughout the restaurant!  My husband always orders Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken and he said this was his Favorite and best he's ever had!  I had a few bites and  it was truly delicious with the fresh pasta and roasted pulled chicken and just the right amount of sauce, it had great flavor!  My Gnocchi was no exception, those tasty little morsels of cheesy mashed potatos if you will and the Tomato Cream sauce was excellent as well although I wish there had been just a tad more sauce.  Our ceasar salad was large enough to share, fresh greens dressed just right but unfortunately no croutons or parmesean?  The bread and butter was really tasty too!  All in all, we had a great experience and would definitely return!",

There is a funky lady there that has worked there for a long time-17 Years? She always remembers you and makes your experience more fun.  Always good food, Always good service. It is a fun little place to go but won't impress someone who is more interested in \"atmosphere\" than in good food and company. This city could use more small restaurants like this that just don't follow the norm.  Speaking of following the norm.  You do need to check when they are open.  Their hours are a little different. It is well worth making a trip to this little place when they are open.    (I usually go there when I am planning on going to the Sprouts in the same center.  I can walk off a few calories after I'm done with dinner!)",

He clearly has some involvement in the \"other Giuseppe's\" and his opinion seems a bit biased.  Some quick points you must know...  Incredibly passionate and friendly owner. He literally walks around all night talking to each table. But it isn't the annoying kind of conversation. It's genuine. I've never left a restaurant feeling happier about the meal and the owner.  Incredibly authentic food. THE best Italian food in the Phoenix area. If you're familiar with the owner's background, you know his knowledge of Italian food is for real. Also a fantastic wine list and some solid beer offerings.  Incredibly cool atmosphere. I've never been to Italy but I grew up near Boston and whenever we wanted truly Italian food, we went to the North End. My brother and I felt like we were there. It's nice to be ten feet from where your food is prepared, cooked, and served.  I would not hesitate for a second to recommend this to a friend or a stranger.",

Big hunk of pork with alot of bone on okay pasta.... The sauce was WAAY watery and just flicked all over the place. The pasta seemed a little on the heavy side. The pork was pretty tender...but eh...$20 for this is way way way to much.   My girlfriend had the bolognese. \"It was good, but tasted like stroganoff\". I have to agree. The noodles were a little dry. They said it had 6 meats, but you couldn't tell because it was all ground together. $16 for this is also way to much.   $3 basket of bread...bread was good, but waaay over priced.  I think the best part was the non-fried calamari. Very tasty.   Though, we felt a little rushed out the door with our child (who didn't enjoy the experience) as some polite customers decided to take over the place with a party of 8 and 5.   We wont be going back here. Much better food elsewhere.",

We had garlic bread which was 5 pieces of cold, stale french bread drizzled with olive oil and dried oregano.  R u kidding me??  My guests were disappointed with their dishes as well and the dinner was not deserving of such high prices.  Some of it came out cold!   Dinner for 4 of us was WAY overpriced.  Only thing good was desert.  Service was just OK, but he didnt take much time to check on us.  The owner thinks he's a 5 star chef.  Gimme a break dude.  Plastic water cups with these prices??  Go to North, or any other place for that matter.  Sign out front is super tacky.  Guy Fieri must have been stoned when he reviewed this place, or else the quality has sunk.  I believe it was years ago anyways.",

    "text": "Since there are no .5 star options, I'm going to round up in this case... but I think 3.5 would be a fair score.  The food is good enough, but didn't blow me away.  Though, did you see them on \"Diners Drive-Ins and Dives\"?  The pork really does fall of the bone in the Osso Bucco dish.  The garlic bread appetizer consists of 4 pieces of bread, and no real garlic.  The prosciutto and melon was good, but the prosciutto was not as soft, or maybe not as fresh (?) as I've had.  The lasagna is a surprisingly small portion, but is filling enough.  And the chicken parmesan is a giant portion that leaves you with probably too much food for lunch leftovers, but perhaps would be better as dinner the next night.  I thought it was really reasonably priced.  The total including tax and tip for our party of 4 was just under $150 and that included 2 appetizers, a soup, 4 entrees, 1 dessert, and 1 bottle of wine.  You know how you have your \"go-to\" restaurants in your neighborhood?  They're the defaults when you want a decent, reasonably priced meal in a familiar place.  The food may not be the best ever, and there is usually no ambience, but they're close and they fulfill your craving for that type of cuisine.  Well, if this restaurant was in my neighborhood, if it were slightly bigger, and if it had real chairs, it might be my \"go-to\" Italian restaurant.",

Go to these places, because Guissepe's is not for you.  It's for lovers of True Northern/Northeast American Italian cuisine. Chicken Parm that is fried, NOT baked, thank you very much. Meatballs that use beef, veal and pork. Sauce that use LOTS of salt, as it should be. Leave your dietary worries at home.   In a word: perfecto.  Robert's passion for music (he's a well known accomplished cellist in NY circles) and food is unparalleled. He is without peer in the state of Arizona.

I had chicken parm and I actually prefer a thinner chicken breast( butterflied).  The breading was soggy, not that light and crispy like I prefer.  The red sauce was just ok.  My uncle makes amazing red sauce that has a great depth of flavor.  This sauce was a little \"tinny\" and lacking for me.  My tummy didnt like it either, I was burping it up all night.   My partner had baked ziti and I actually hated this.  Trying a bite of hers, made me crave my baked ziti.  This baked ziti had a huge lump of ricotta on top( not mixed in).  To me, that is not proper baked ziti.  The pasta wasnt sauced enough either.    My aunt had eggplant.  cant comment on that since I despise eggplant.  She loved it though.  My uncle had a pasta dish that had brocolli rabe and gemelli pasta.  They subbed out chicken for the sausage so my uncle was happy.  The bread was so/so.  The salad was basic.  The dressing wasnt emulsified ( pool of oil on the bottom of the plate). My homemade flourless choc. cake was the best thing about the meal.  The owner was very nice, but I was just not that impressed with this food.  I've had way better Italian food in S. Florida.  Cheaper too.",

I confirmed they take reservations and that they would be able to seat 12 on a Friday night. They said that wouldn't be a problem, and asked if we would be comfortable with the patio. I said that was fine. The day of they called 3 times to confirm our reservation, make sure it was still on and to confirm we were still comfortable with the patio. Each time I confirmed the reservation and that we were happy with the patio. Then we get there that night and they say the wait is \"45 minutes\" I said we had a reservation and they said the wait is still \"45 minutes\". I asked to speak with the manager and they took me to the owner, I said \"Hi, I'm here for my 6:30pm reservation.\" He very rudely said as I told your family it's a 45 minute wait. I then asked why he took my reservation if he couldn't accommodate us? He again rudely said \"It's busy on a Friday night and a bunch of people showed up, what do you want me to do?\" He kept trying to argue with me, was EXTREMELY rude and never once apologized. We couldn't wait the 45 minutes, 6:30pm was already a very late reservation for a little one from the East Coast, so we couldn't push it another 45 minutes, which is why we had a reservation! I know now how small the restaurant is, he should have just told me from the beginning they couldn't accommodate us. Most people won't be going here with big parties, but I would still not support this restaurant because of their horrible service, and really really mean owner!",

We arrived early and waited for about forty five minutes or so for our seats in the rear, near the kitchen.  This was actually a good place, since we had no one sitting next to us and all the other seats were on top of each other, elbow to elbow.   Giuseppe's may seem like a one man show because the owner Rich is woking both ends of the house, but we believe there were three others working in the kitchen.    We started with Antipasto for $10.95, and then ordered our normal baseline meal of Chicken Breast Parmigiana for $14.95 and the Pasta Bolognese Ragu with a side of Meatballs and Sausage for $16.95, plus the $4.00 up charge.  We also had two soft drinks, which seemed expensive at $3.00 each.   The food was very good for what they call: \"Phoenix's Favorite Local Italian Kitchen!\"  I know they've taken some heat for being on the Food Network and Guy Fieri's show \"Diners, Drive-In and Dives\".  But this is nothing more then a good local Italian place.  It's not gourmet, but neither are the restaurants on the show Three Star Michelin either.   Our meal ran $61.92 including taxes, but before Tip.  We enjoyed ourselves and will be back.  Enjoy!",

The server acted annoyed that we didn't want to eat outside in 105 degrees. We had said we would wait at most likely exaggerated 45 min wait time. He didn't ask us if we would like a drink, just plain rude. Don't know if I will ever go back to see if their food is as good as people say.",

    "text": "Well I held out on writing a review based off my 1st experience,  which was two weeks ago.  I called in a order to carry out.  I ordered shrimp fettuccine Alfredo with fig and marscopone purchtuo burchettas. When I got home it was terrible.  The pasta is home made so it's super thick.  Four small shrimp and hardly no Alfredo sauce, I mean dry. That fake bruccetta is hard and dry.  So I called a spoke to Cindy and explained that I lived far from the location.  It practically took me an hour to get there and I couldn't come back.  So she put the owner in the phone and we worked out a deal that I would get a $27.00 credit the next time I came in.   Fast forward to today which was a couple of weeks later. When I arrived Cindy wasn't there but the owner Richard was.  So I explained who I was and he remembered. So he said I can give you a $17.00 credit because you ate the meal didn't you?  I didn't even touch that dry mess. So being pressured and embarrassed of what the phone conversation was and what he was saying to my face and the place was packed and I didn't want to argue.  I just ordered their signature dish, the Osso buco to- go again. So the waiter rang me up and I ended up paying them about $15.00 additional dollars.  I was pissed off. But I figured well maybe it will be worth it.  I get home and make nice salads for me and my husband to accompany the meal still with high hopes because it looks good and the meat is falling off the bone. So we eat it with disappointment.  The sauce is tasteless I mean no flavor at all the bread was dry.  I will never return. I will go to Olive garden which I far better than this place. Or just wait to go back to New York and eat authentic Italian at Carmine's or Rao's in Vegas. Or for great bruccettas go to Postionos.  I don't know why this place is crowded.  The food is bland and it's so tiny.  I have been to several DDD destinations this one is a BIG miss.",

    "text": "wow  such Italian  very diner  I wandered into Giuseppe's on a Friday evening when, after a highly productive day, I was in the grip of the sort of letdown where one feels acutely aware of one's own mortality and the fragility of the word, a mood that requires a polysyllabic German word, so I'm going to give it one: Weltgrunegotterdammerung.  My original plan was to try out the Angry Crab, but the shrieks of the happy hour revelers could be heard halfway down the arcade of the shopping plaza, and being surrounded by \"young professionals\" getting wasted on bloody marys is not a cure for Weltgrunegotterdammerung.  Giuseppe's is a price notch upward (blackboard basic entrees are ~$11 and menu fancy entrees are in mostly in the mid/high teens) but comes with peace, quiet, and a sense of participating in that uniquely American institution: the fine-ish dining hole-in-the-wall in a strip mall. Plus you can combine watching the sun set behind the palm trees with pretending you're in Rome in the 1950s, and any moment now, Audrey Hepburn is going to pull up on a Vespa.  The point of the bread is to mop up the excess pasta sauce, as it's happy sponge-y bread rather than bread that one eats on its own and then spends three years trying to reproduce at home with dutch ovens and spritzers. I consumed an insane amount of it while sponging up the butter/oil-type sauce from the shrimp ravioli because it was the sort of sauce that one is required to sponge, if not to actually lick the plate. If a little splashes or spills in the sponging process, it probably does excellent things for soft, younger-looking skin, too.  The shrimp ravioli contained an identifiable shrimp! I've never before encountered anything that wasn't a mash in a seafood rav anywhere, nor a sauce that contained spices rather than being all alfredo-esque. The rav were very nice, with some crab and some ricotta -- just rich enough to feel reasonably content with the quantity, but not taking it to the point where one wonders what one just did. I'm actually relieved not to have fallen madly in love with them -- sorry, shrimp rav, it was just a fling, as there are many other tempting items on the menu. Boar ragu!  True love -- or at least strong animal passion -- is elicited by the white-chocolate creme brulee. Dante would have written several volumes in verse to the white-chocolate creme brulee.  I'm reviewing it partly so it can be added to the \"kind to lone diners\" list, as the staff were absolute sweethearts. They were clearly trying to hit the right pace where I could enjoy a leisurely meal without feeling neglected (or, conversely, be promptly attended to without feeling rushed) -- and since I myself didn't really know what mood I was in (Weltgrunegotterdammerung will do that for a girl), that was a bit of a challenge. I strongly suspect that this is the sort of place where, if you go regularly, they remember you and see that things are as you like them.",

The garlic bread was deliciously heavy on the garlic and butter. Despite being drenched, it's texture was surprisingly still crisp on the outside and soft in the inside. (You order by the basket for $4, otherwise, you get regular bread which is meh).  The baked ziti was perfect. The penne pasta was perfectly cooked. The ricotta cheese was nicely proportionally mixed in with the pasta and sauce. Its a simple dish, yet satisfying.  The tiramisu was also mouthwateringly delicious. Its consistency was very mousse-like  making it basically melt in your mouth after every bite.",

We like spicy and were pleased with the heat, and also that they do not use too much salt. Also, they serve up the calamari flash pan fried and not deep fried and so expose their ability to cook rather than hiding things under batter. The calamari was great and the sauce nice to sop up with bread. It was very Italian and even the ambiance was pleasant. A recommendation is for them to add a lobster tail (ala Arthur Avenue) for desert:)",

We also started with the prosciutto and melon. The appetizer was amazing, just like I got in Italy. The sandwiches were both fantastic, I am still trying to decide which was my favorite. They had plenty of cheese and sauce and were falling apart and messy and yummy just the way a saucy italian sandwich should be!  They have ice tea and a variety of soda's and italian sodas but they are in a can fyi. Tables are a little close but the food was worth at as well as the service. We did have a local dines voucher for half off the meal but the prices were really great. We really felt like we got out money's worth and would go back in a second without the coupon.

I had finished my cold bread and my plate of pasta with meat sauce arrived.   The pasta was good, the sauce had zero flavor. It was meaty but did not have a flavor at all. I tried a bit of Parmesan, nope. I asked for salt and pepper, didn't help. I was bumming.   My meal, by myself, was $18.00 for a plate of noodles and boring meat sauce, and cold bread from Safeway.

Started with the calamari which was sauteed and served in a nice tomato broth, garlic bread, burrata and the eggplant appetizer.  All of which were delicious! For dinner I had the cavitappi with sausage and broccoli rabe, my husband had the bolognese, 2 people in our party had the lobster risotto and 1 had the osso busco. Everyone raved about their meal. For dessert we had home made cannoli and key lime pie, both were delish. Check this place out!",

    "text": "I try not to throw around 5-stars out like gang signs, because I really want to reserve the primo ratings for places that really knock my socks off. But, Giuseppe's is quite deserving of the highest rating because it really is a gem of a place.   Voted New Times Best of Phoenix Neighborhood Italian (2003), veal (2004) and BYOB (2005), Giuseppe's certainly has earned such accolades. However, in all fairness, I must say I do not live in the neighborhood nor did I have the veal. But, I'll most definitely be trying the veal. And since I went with Robert M, you should know that BYOB is a given. Well, honestly, since I showed up it's almost certain that I'm carrying some form of alcohol on my person.   After watching a decidedly emotionally-charged movie at Camelview (The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, an amazing must-see even though a key element in the film is grossly misleading--PM me if you've seen it and I'll share) Robert M and I needed to do something to appreciate the goodness in life so we decided to devirginize ourselves of the Giuseppe's experience. It was about 4:45 p.m. on a Saturday and we were seated immediately. Tucked into a strip mall, it immediately reminded us of the set-up of Pizza A Metro. After reviewing the menu, Robert walked over to Sprouts for wine and we ordered three bruschetta (slow-cooked pork ribs with tomato & melted mozzarella, pesto &fresh tomato and chevre & marinated sun-dried tomatoes) that were all extremely delicious. The bread remained firm and not soggy, yet not so hard that it hurt your teeth or cut the roof of your mouth. We also split the lasagna which was made with fresh pasta and plated with the most divine \"gravy\" [for all the Italians, although I'm Irish] that we've ever tasted. So *smooth* and not bitter or acidic or sweet or anything less than heavenly. If I could bathe in this, I would. But, since I'm not a splosher... :blush:   If only I wouldn't have eaten so much popcorn in the hour before going to Giuseppe's, I would have indulged in so much more. But, alas, I have found a reason to take this Avenue kid back to the Streets: Giuseppe's.",

    "text": "When I was a kid I would eat a pile of plain noodles with butter on them while the rest of my family mowed down on real Italian food. I think it had more to do with the fact that spaghetti given to a kiddo is more likely to end up on them than in them, and tomato sauce hurts when it ends up in your eye. But in twenty-odd years my palate has matured past the realm of bland noodles and into the realm of big girl flavors. I think that's why I was so disappointed by Giuseppe's.   I ordered the smoked salmon with asparagus pasta, thinking, \"Heck yeah, lox me up and throw away the key!\" Instead, I got the toddler special in disguise, a big pile of noodles drowning in butter, with flakes of salmon and asparagus floating throughout. Ewwie. The noodles were freshly prepared since it was the weekend and were a doughy delight. It's too bad they were marred by such a crap combination. I mean, you can't even toss in some garlic, onions or something vaguely resembling seasoning? Failure, failure, failure.  My boyfriend's pasta carbonara was a thing of beauty. It is very difficult to find real carbonara in the valley. Most places just toss together white sauce and bacon and call it a night. Very few take the time to saute onions, garlic and pancetta, add steaming hot pasta, raw egg and parmesan cheese and toss until it oozes together into drool inducing blob of yum. Amazing good.   It's just odd that such contradictory dishes are on the same menu.   We also had the garlic bread, because what better to add to a giant pile of carbs than more bread? It was passable. Very dry and crispy, more like crouton, and topped with a delish garlicky spice infused oil. Four tiny toastettes for four bucks though. Not the greatest deal.   I shall be back. I'll just stay far, far away from the noodly combos of questionable origin.   P.S.  To all my winos out there-- corking fee of 4 bucks!",

    "text": "Wow, wow, wow! Giuseppe's on 28th isn't fancy looking but the food is absolutely wonderful. The place is small and so they clearly have high quality control because everything was off the charts delicious. The sign out front about being on the Food Network is a bit corny, but don't let that stop you - this is the real deal.  We started the evening with the squid in white wine and one taste had me thinking about building a shrine to its greatness. The squid was so fresh and tender, the tomato sauce had a deep richness and sharp spice, and the peas (courtesy of Tuscany) were a stroke of regional genius. You'll never eat fried squid again - this is the only way to go. We ordered the garlic bread to sop up every drop of tomato sauce.  We tried the bruscetta which is prepared on the most wonderful bread you will ever taste. My wife said it is from Willo? I'm not sure ,but I was thinking maybe heaven? You get 4 different slices - the one with prosciutto, fig and goat cheese was magnificent.Then the dinner. You must try the \"as seen on the Food Network\" Osso Buco. Oh my God - this was the best meal I've had in a long, long time. Parked on a bed of home made noodles was the most extraordinary marinated meat with a complex tomato-based sauce that could bring Michaelangelo back from the dead to declare his entire lifes' work a failure in comparison to this work of culinary art. Savor the beauty. My wife had the manicotti, which because of the fine tomato sauce and fresh noodles, was excellent.  We finished the meal with tiramisu. After one taste I laughed out loud at anyone that would give this place a negative review. That would be the definition of a shill. Giuseppe's on 28th is not the fanciest, but it is the best Tuscan-Italian food you will eat in Phoenix. Delizioso! We also thought it was pretty cool that the owner walks around and makes sure everything is perfect. It was!",

It felt less like a chain laid out for maximum amount of getting people in and out and more like a place that was made in homage to good food where you could sit and have a nice long meal.   We went there after the food network special and got the bolognese - it was really delicious. The food isn't too expensive, it's all the add-ons. When you go there you just can't help order an appetizer, a meal, a bottle of wine AND dessert.   It's totally worth a visit if you haven't been yet!",

It didn't hold a candle to the antipasto salad from Spinato's. Try both & tell me I'm wrong.  I also ordered 3 meatballs. These poor meatballs were the tiniest meatballs I have ever been served in a restaurant. I felt cheated for the price of those little balls. Try the meatballs at Lisa G's instead. They are huge & delicious & you'll have leftovers for the next day.  I am all for supporting local businesses, but I need to feel like I am getting a great product for a reasonable price.

    "text": "This place seems to want to get rich off being featured on Food Network.  There's a big banner out front now and there are pictures all over the place of the owner (i'm guessing) and Guy.  Anyway, this is why I decided to try the place at all so maybe it worked.  My friend ordered the chicken parmigiana sandwich and I went with the Linguine with Red Clam sauce.  Its a very tiny place with plastic patio chairs.  We waited for about 20 min so we had time to check out the decor.    The prices are crazy!  They charge as much as a full Italian restaurant does - I've never seen a diner, drive thru or a dive that charges so much per plate!  Skimming the menu, I'd say the average entree is about 12, appetizer is 8, desert is 5.    So by the time we got our food we were starving, but we managed to drive home which was about 5 min away.  They gave me a few pieces of bread for my pasta which was very good (and very surprising because bread is on the menu for like $5).  The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was WAAAY salty.  The portion wasn't what I expected for the price I paid at a \"dive\".  The sandwich was a little better, but nothing special.  I work at a hospital and I'd say their chicken parmigian is better.  All in all, this wasn't the best experience.  I say if they want to charge so much, open an actual restaurant.  Then maybe they can serve some liquor instead of just having pictures of wine bottles everywhere and empty vodka bottles holding flowers.  (Its BYOB, $5 corkage fee).  I'm very disappointed in Food Network.  :\\",

Misters and drinking water would have been a nice touch to make the 10-20min 104 degree wait more bearable.   The minute we saw the paper table cloths and plastic chairs,cups & utensils we were in trouble. One waiter frantically tried to service the whole restaurant, which was a complete zoo. Now according to Triple D, the pasta was homemade....aaaaaah.....not so much.... Ive been to Italy, I know the difference.    Cut to the chase, $27.00 for two a la carte / appetizer sized entrees.  Seems to me, his only goal is cashing in on the TV appearance as quickly as possible with no concern to repeat business...  Don't waste your time and money....On a positive note, Guy was right about Matts Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix, great good and the best costumer service we've ever had.",

This is the kinda place you find in New York (yes Irene I have been And lived there so fughedaboudid!!!).  Its real small, the people are very kind but curt and will tell you what to do and you will not sit at a table for 4 if you are only a 2 top.  Ok?! Now lets get started.  If you get there when it is not busy you are told to pick your table (remember the rule wise guy!). We declined wine/cocktail or beer, since we (lil ms. longlegs n I) were going to the movies after eating and we did not want to get the tireds n slows.  So we ordered water and ice tea which came in plastic cups (this was why I gave it only 4 stars).  Lil Ms. Longlegs ordered the bruschetta for her main meal (you get to choose which ones you want) I ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana with the homemade pasta.  We thought the bruschetta was adequate (bread was not overly impressive) but the Eggplant was divine.  Sliced thin and very lightly breaded with thin sliced mozzarella and the sauce was very good (a little tame for me but still excellent).  We both thought that for the food and ambiance their pricing was a little on the high side.  We will go back and try some of their other dishes.  This place was on Food Channel which we figured it would be an \"11\" on a scale of 1 to 10.  I give it a 8.2, Ms. L.L. gave it a 9.  Ciao Piasanos.",

It was $32 for two pasta dishes and bread. I am so angry right now that I didn't go with my gut feeling and just go to Mamma Mia's.

On one hand, I'm glad I did.  I've been lucky finding good Italian food places as of late.  It's also nice to know what people are fussing over with places like this, that get noticed after being on tv.  On the other hand, the overall experience I just found lacking.  Yes, I know it was on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Even though I suspect it falls into the first category, I still think it could have been better.  There was a wait.  Which only shocked me since it was an off night, so be aware of that.  Reading many of the previous reviews, I had caught that it was BYOB.  So we had run over to the Sprouts next door and grabbed a few bottles.  Surprise!  No more BYOB.  Oh well, wine never really goes to waste.  The place was cramped, and my party of 5 was squashed into a tiny corner table.  Then, what made that even more exciting, was the roving guitar player that started as we sat down.  As far as ambiance goes, he and his female vocal accompaniment left a bit to be desired.  The food was good.  If I were to rate solely on that, it's deserving of 3 stars easily.  The eggplant appetizer was thin sliced and breaded, though I would have liked more of the red sauce on it to combat the dryness of the breading.  I can't comment too well on the bruschetta appetizer, as splitting 4 different types 5 ways doesn't allow for a sizable tasting.  The bolognese I had was very tasty, and the inclusion of ox tail to it was a very very good one.  But in the end, the pretty good food couldn't save me from an overall \"meh\" dining experience.",

    "text": "After a bad experience with a friend several months ago (mostly our server,) I decided to try again a couple more times with a New Times deal. The food isn't bad, although a bit overpriced (a friend told me they raised their prices after being featured on DDD several years ago). The eggplant parmesan was good. The first time I went back, my server asked me after placing my salad and entree order if I would like some garlic bread. I said sure, thinking it would be complimentary as it often is at Italian places, and she said it casually enough to make it seem so. I do not recall seeing it on the menu. I got my bill and it was $4. I later noticed it was on the menu board which seems to be geared for their takeout customers. The second time I declined when she offered garlic bread again, and I even declined the basic bread and butter she offered me later because I wasn't sure how much it would cost! In my opinion, that would be like a Mexican restaurant offering you chips and salsa and then charging you for it. If I want to pay for it, I will order it. Given the offerings in the area with bar seating and similar, if not lower prices, I will probably not return any time soon.",

It's small, so sometimes there can be a wait involved. Even though its small, because of the very personal service by the owner, the service can be lacking or distracted.  The food, however, is well worth it!   I try to get something new each time I go, and I've never been disappointed.",

    "text": "We arrived last Friday at 4:30 anticipating a crowd after seeing Check Please Arizona reviews.  We were informed they open at 5PM.  We waited outside and noticed a guest sign in form which we assumed we would be called in order at 5pm.  That was not the case.  Quite a few had shown up and also put names on the list.  Just before 5pm they let the whole heard of people in at the same time. The restaurant is very small and all tables filled up quickly.  There initially was only ONE waitress for about 10 minutes then another started taking drink orders.  We almost walked out as they clearly did not prepare the way they should have.  Anyway, long story short....I got the Veal Meatloaf.  Very disappointing for $16.  Overpriced and lacking flavor.   There was nothing memorable about it and even part of the top was hard and overcooked.  My wife however absolutely loved her entree.  I don't know the name of it but it had black noodles, shrimp, mussels, squid (I think) and not sure what else.  In fairness, I will go back again as there are several things on the menu I would like to try. I just don't understand the guest sign in log and would certainly not recommend the Veal Meatloaf.  We did briefly talk to the table next to us and they seemed pleased with the entrees they had.  I say go give it a try!",

    "text": "After seeing the segment on Food Network we were very excited to try this place...WHAT A MISTAKE!! We ordered the Bruschetta, Salad, and the house specialty, Pasta Bolognese ragu.  The Bruschetta  arrived on store bought, thick cut, un-toasted bread.  The tomatoes were not ripe, and the other toppings were very disappointing.  Then came the salad,  which looked as if it were prepared in a preschool cooking class.  There was NO dressing,  the tomatoes were sliced like for sandwiches, and not ripe,  one slice still had the stem!  The carrots were in large inedible chunks.  Finally came the house specialty pasta bolognese.  They claim to use 6 different meats for this, but it looked and tasted like someone had opened a can of wet dog food, heated it up and tossed it with fettucine.  We were so disgusted by our experience that we will never go back.  We never complained, but after our culinary disaster, I had to write this review. BTW--- Please do not confuse this place with the Scottsdale location, different owner, different menu.",

This is the type of Italian food you'd get in great little out-of-the way Tuscan hill town restaurants that serve the locals (not the tourist traps).  It's always a relaxed friendly atmosphere and the food is always awesome.  As several reviewers have mentioned, don't forget to BYOB - but no worries if you do because you can grab some at Sprout's next door.    The owner plays in the Phoenix Symphony, and he knows his Italy!",

Of course we love a place like Pizzeria Bianco or Cibo, but have been looking for something a little less pricey. We absolutely loved our meal. We both had pasta dishes and their pasta was fresh and out of this world. Both of our sauces were also amazing, and the meatballs that went with my dish were the best I have had in years.  We had a lovely antipasto but weren't overly impressed with the bread. Our waiter, Patrick, was very knowledgeable and made a recommendation to me that helped to make my meal very special. My comment to him after our meal was, \"You are the man!\" On the negative side, the meal was still a tad pricey, but was absolutely worth it. We will definitely go back and are excited to try some of their other pasta dishes.",

    "text": "First, this place is very small and though accommodating, a little too crammed in there. They would benefit from taking at least one table out so that customers and servers can maneuver to and from the tables. The  server we had last night was awesome...very friendly and made our experience great. The food was ok. We started with a house salad that was seriously over-dressed. I had the bolognese and my boyfriend had the baked ziti. My pasta seemed homemade and the sauce was a tad bland but still pretty good. The baked ziti was good. Nothing special. I felt it was quite over priced. $50 for one salad, garlic bread, and two mediocre pasta dishes. Not sure if we will return because there just wasn't anything special about the place other than Diners, drive-ins and dives went there. I'd sure like to know what Guy ordered. I also think they have a new owner so I can't compare it to how it used to be.",

We were lured into the restaurant because the it was featured on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives and our love of small Italian eateries.  My wife ordered the tortellini and I ordered linguini with white clam sauce,  garlic bread & avocado & tomato salad.  The bread was warmed in a an oven and came out dry and crusty.   the salad was the best thing we had.  My linquini was more like fettuccine but it was fresh/home made, nice and light. there was an abundance of clams but it so over salted I did not want to take the left overs home.  The marinara meat/sauce on my wife's tortellini was very thick and was okay. She ordered it with meatballs instead of sausage but it came out without the meatballs.  The waiter recognized the error and wanted to correct it.  The person next to me ordered the gnochi, which was my second choice, it looked very good and plentiful.  The restaurant is very small and cramped.  We sat next to two guys that were about two feet away, how ever there is seating outside.  The servers and the owner was very friendly and we received good service.",

I should have went with my gut and left when the server brought out plastic cups with flex straws that it wasn't  going to be a good experience . She was told to get there early because at certain times of the day there's a line to get in which is True I'm assuming considering there's room for about 15 people in the dinning area . I ordered spaghetti and meatballs pasta was dry sauce was a little rich and the meatballs were a little on the salty side. Very diss appointing my boy ordered lasagna and my girl ordered one of the specials on the board and our friend ordered the same as myself spaghetti and meatballs . With an order of garlic bread which came out way to early so it sat getting cold . So when the bill came out it was a whopping $90. Don't  get me wrong I don't mind paying good money for good food but this time I totally felt robbed . I would not go to this place again if someone else was paying .",

The 'As seen on Food Network' sign should have been a tip off, but I wanted to try the Pasta Bolognese that Guy raved about on the show.  The shop is extremely small with maybe seating for about 30.  The tables were squeezed in togther so if it was a full house, it would be difficult to walk around.  The chairs were cheap plastic chairs.   Not what I would have expected for an Italian restaurant.  Weird thing is I had to order at the front window and pay on the spot like I was ordering take out.  Really??  I ordered the Bolognese and an Iced Tea and my bill came to $24 dollars (included tip before even tasting anything!  Sheez)  The hostess served up some bread with some very cold butter packets first and then the pasta came out.  The homemade pasta was pretty good in taste and texture, but Bolognese depressed me!  I dont know how they did it, but it was dry and missing that mixed flavor of the vegetable ingredients.  Maybe it was overcooked or bottom of the barrel for my dish?  Who knows really cept that I was not impressed.  I tried it once,, and I'll pass from going again..",
