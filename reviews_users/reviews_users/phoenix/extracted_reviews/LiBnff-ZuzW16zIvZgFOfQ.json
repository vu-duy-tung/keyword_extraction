    "text": "It isn't that often that I take too much time away from my desk to have lunch.  But, I've gone to Canasta near 7th and Grant for over 36 years.  Today, knew I could stop by for some quick take out.  But, I was completely turned off by the short Latino male cashier, with wire-rimmed glasses, who belittled a young black server in front of 4 different customers who were waiting for their take out orders.  As a mother of a young man myself, and former supervisor, I am appalled by the tone and manner in which this older cashier talked to the younger waiter.  It was a poor example of coaching, guiding or setting an example for the younger staff member.  All he did was try to humiliate him... until I walked up to him to interrupt and coach the cashier.  I told him he didn't have to speak to the young man in that manner and if he did something wrong and needed to be corrected, he should not do it in the front of the restaurant for all to hear.  But rather, take him to the side later to coach him (especially not during peak lunch hour).  I mentioned that I knew many members of the Abril family and he said, \"Oh yeah?\" I told him that they would be equally appalled if they too had heard the language and the tone that he used with this young staff member.  In total, I stood there at the cash register for about 3 minutes and he did not apologize to the young man, to me, or any the customers who witnessed his use of poor judgment.  The cashier's only response was: \"Yeah, I have to get better at that.\" I am placing this information on yelp and on Facebook -- and I am going to ask my friends, friends to share this information.  I suspect this rating will not get a good response.  But, my hope is that they will consider providing in-service training to their employees so that this doesn't just happen again to this young male server but so that it doesn't happen again to other employees -- especially in front of a group of customers.",

The Service: I would say very good friendly and sociable and always comes to check on ya.  The Food: WOWZERS The food is amazing. I've been in Arizona for roughly a year or more and this place is hands down the best. I ordered a special that had a tamale and cheese enchilada with rice and beans. I upgraded my cheese enchilada to beef for a $1.00 more which is nothing. Now the tasting, the rice....how do I say this....ohhhh eeem geee....haha. Super amazing by itself, I can probably eat the rice by itself for an entire plate and be simply satisfied. They do start you off with salsa that is chunky and they have one in a ketchup bottle that is super amazing. I have no idea whats in it, but wow its good. Anyways, back to the food. The tamale was ok, but the enchilada was to die for. I had the red sauce and man oh man when I found out it was ground beef....I thought I was in Texas again. I had to slap myself out of it. The enchilada dinner here is by far the best. I think I'll try the fajitas next time around. Can't wait to get back in there.  Thanks guys for having such great food. It's too bad your way out in phoenix or else I'd be a for sure regular in the east valley.",

When we placed the order, the server said we could pay separately at the counter. When we got to the counter, the EXTREMELY RUDE cashier was short with us and said he didn't have time and he was too busy to split our checks. I told him we were told we were able to and he didn't care. One of us ended up paying for everyone and will work out the costs later. I have never dealt with such a rude and ill-mannered cashier.

Got inside and the atmosphere was less than desirable, felt like I was at work in a warehouse with shitty ventilation. Chips and salsa arrived, half chips half crumbs, and the salsa appeared to be a bowl of canned stewed tomatos, which in my mind trying to figure out how to dip this chip into this thick salsa that looks like it's just chunks of tomato. So the entrees come and our waitress as serving us spills hot water off one of the plates on my girl, and doesn't come back with any towel or ice, while my girl believes it was accidental, I think waitress did it on purpose because my girl appears to be a snobby bitch all the time. (She can't help it, it's just the way she comes off)  so while enjoying our entrees, yup I said enjoying, it wasn't all bad food was okay except the enchiladas, the tortillas seemed stale like the plate was made 2 days ago and reheated just for me. The ticker was when were watching the game 2 angry roaches came out of no where fussing and arguing about who was gonna win the game, not bugging any one else while they did their debate (ha I said not bugging any one) my girl whose got a serious disgust and fear of roaches fled the restaurant and waited in the car on this 100+  degree that day. Cashier was curious about the situation and took care of us otherwise after explaining what happened. That would be my last time visiting, wondering what the roaches do while they aren't fighting over sports, probably using huge chunks of tomatos to float on in the thick salsa to keep cool while inside.",

For those who are checking out the restaurant for the first time, there is a self-serve area with corn/flour tortilla chips and salsa. Highly recommended!",

It's insanity to see those people sitting out there waiting to be called into a restaurant with extremely dated decor covered by a healthy layer of dust and dirt. Restaurant is super small, dirty with food that comes out of a box (hard shell tacos). Forced ourselves to go as sacrifice to some good friends who would occasionally invite us to this place, where they gathered religiously every Sunday after Church. After a while, we could not take it any longer!! After one invitation to Rosita's, they finally got to taste what real, fresh, delicious, authentic and affordable Mexican food tastes like. Please, please people; do not settle for this place, you deserve better! To no surprise, they have changed their Sunday brunch location to something that actually states good, NOW THAT'S A LINE WORTH WAITING FOR. I'd like to think we saved three generations of taste buds. YOU'RE WELCOME :)",

It was so good, the hubs, a meat eater, only wanted to share my food. Plus, the strawberry margaritas were like smoothies. Perfectly mixed.

The menudo is also a popular dish (although I have no firsthand knowledge). We look forward to coming here on Sundays for breakfast. And we're not alone because it's often packed Sunday mornings. As a result, service has been slow at times. On our last visit the waiter kept forgetting to refill our drinks or bring our check and then he forgot \"to-go\" boxes.

We order at the front and walk to the dinning area and then the manager comes all agited and mad at us because we order to go not to dine in if we really wanted to dine in we will have to pay him $3.00 at the moment, after all that we finally got our food Green Chili Chimichangas. Food taste ok but when we were almost done my friend found a RUBERBAND on her food.YUCK that was the end of it. We had to talk to the Manager again. Honestly if you can avoid that place better.",

The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best I've tasted.  The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriend's favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special.

Then it tasted like it was yesterday's, you know that funk like the tea pot wasn't cleaned out the night before. 1.99 for watered down gross.  Fish tacos, 2 for 5.99 I opened them and they were loaded with lettuce and salsa. Oh and cheese was sprinkled in there. Looked for the fish, and oh there are some little tiny chunks mixed in. I taste it and no kidding it was yesterday's salsa because it didn't taste of the salsa on the table, it had that over night onion flavor left over thing going on. yuck. Guess they were going for the big taco look of something??  Wasn't fish! Maybe one piece of fish diced between the two. I looked!   All I could think of was that i didn't have time to go else where or I would have got up and left.   I have to say I expected more based on reviews. I wouldn't go back if someone offered to buy!

Restaurants that are not willing to split checks usually move to my 'do  not visit again' list. The food is average, I have definitely had better in the area. However the lunch specials are very affordable and for the price, the food is not that bad. The staff was friendly and we received our food fairly quickly. The part that takes longest is paying the bill. Not only will they not split the check, they have one cashier that we all must walk up to and pay.

I was driving to another place for dinner and drove by La Canasta and there were a lot of cars in the lot, and mentally noted where it was.  Got to the other place and it was CLOSED, back to La Canasta.  The salsa in my opinion was a home run. A little chunkier than what you would traditionally think of as salsa but very good none the less.  Had iced tea to drink and the 2 chicken enchilada combination.  The food came very hot, yes food is suppose to be hot!!!!!  The entire meal was very good, and the service was right on par.  My tea was never empty.  The best part is the bill was $11.13 before tax and I was very full, almost too full.  My one constructive criticism is that the food and salsa were a little on the salty side, but not over the top.  Overall a good experience and it felt a lot like my favorite place at home that I have been going to now 24 years!!!!!!!",

The beans are delicious, service is prompt and the hot sauce in the ketchup bottle is what I fantasize about when I wake up on a weekend morning. I usually get the Nana's Special nearly every time we're there for breakfast. Green or red chile, it's all great. It's consistently yummy and warm chips will keep you content until your order is up. Lately I've been ordering the #3 Red Burrito lunch special with rice and beans for $6 and change. The Red chile reminds me of being a little kid at a school fiesta. Mmmm.  The only downside is that we miss Manuel, our favorite waiter, who moved away! He memorized our orders exactly and had the best personality. But the rest of the staff are pretty damn good too though.  When we were married a couple of weeks ago, last minute we decided to change the menu and so we called La Canasta to get a quote for dinner for 80 people. When I say last minute I mean 3 days notice. We got a great price, excellent customer service from Richard, and a ton of compliments from all of our guests. Seriously, when was the last time you heard about people liking wedding food?",

I get there my order was not placed and the cashier machine clearly was not working and he had to swipe my card 3 times and told me each time that it was declined. I felt like i was being pressured into showing the guy my bank app to prove that my card was working and they had charged me 2 times for 1 order. i requested to speak to the manger and it took him almost 23 minutes to even come out to the front. The manager was so rude and kept telling me i was my problem that my card didn't work when they had charge me 2 times there was nothing resolved. i ended up storming out this place with double charges and NO FOOD!!!! i will never go back again they just lost a committed customer.",

Thumbs up all around.  I will tell everyone!",

And make sure their putting in fresh salsa in them in the morning . And I'm sure they  make  pretty penny to be able to close down at lease one day have all workers ,which I'm sure most of them are family. To come in and give the place a GOOD!!! Cleaning , and invest in some new tables and chairs . and to clean air vents. Plus paint . last time I was in there felt I'll . nauseous food like didnt set well   I really hope the owners see reviews and do something about their Business .  Just doesn't seem that they care to much about their Buisness only worry about getting money???",

When I called the 4th time and talked to someone and explained the situation they said were sorry you're going to have to wait. I was like I've been waiting and got hung up every time and they said wait longer and put me on hold. That's very bad customer service if you ask me. I'm very understandable, but having to wait over 20 mins to put a food order to go is ridiculous. To explain the situation to some gentleman and get still get put on hold. La Canasta you just lost a very big families business.",

Only issue I had that kept it from getting a full five stars was the shredded beef taco I'd ordered. It was extremely salty and I had to send it back.

I used to enjoy eating here back in the day. I came to La Ca Nasta while I was in town visiting family a few days ago and was disappointed. One thing I can say is service is pretty good. I don't care too much for the new salsa they have now. But I am glad to see they still have the same red salsa they used to have years ago! I ordered the chicken tacos (hard & soft shells), which came with lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes. The tacos were just okay. I should have gotten the chicken enchiladas but oh well. I also had the traditional margarita which was not strong at all. I don't even think there was any liquor in it. Anywho, overall service is decent and food is just okay.",

The female manager who is there truly does not know the first thing about customer service or attending to a customer. There is no room for a customer request or accommodation. I gave it three different tries and will not be returning. If you would like good food, reasonable prices and friendly customer service just go to another La Canasta.

Pretty good environment with TVs playing sports and plenty of variety of breakfast food to good Mexican food.   My first time coming here I noticed the menu is huge! So many choices and was tough cause I wanted to try so many things. I ended up going with the lunch combo with the bean and cheese burrito, cheese enchilada and taco. Crazy thing is it was all for $8! Was a deal! So much food and all of it was pretty good food. Not anything too spectacular but still solid food and the price is what makes it better.  I did really enjoy the cheese enchiladas more than anything. I can could of just had 10 more of those! The bean and cheese was good but I feel like the beans could of tasted a little better. The chicken taco was ok, but I felt like the chicken was a little strange. Maybe it was more if a boiled chicken but it just didn't taste that good to me.  All around a good place with good food but an even better price for what you get. Good place to check out if your in the area for some good Mexican food on a budget",

La Canasta was very authentic-centric with earth tones everywhere, Mexican decor and the Bee-Gees on the speakers. Wait, what?  Yes, sadly.   The to go menu had no prices posted. Very clever. I got two tacos, a chimichanga and side of rice for $17.50. Hope they're good!  My dinner arrived in 10 minutes but didn't open it until I got home which can be an issue sometimes. I asked her to double check the order and she said she had already. The tacos were missing when I got home.   Sorry, no return visit planned from this elite Yelper.",

Even during the lunch rush, the wait isn't unreasonable so La Canasta is a favorite spot for my team at work. Takeout orders are usually ready within 20 minutes of calling.  Out of everything I've tried so far, my favorite is the breakfast burrito (eggs, cheese and machaca beef), and the carne asada burrito. The classic cheese quesadilla is good too. I'm especially impressed with the salsa/hot sauce at La Canasta. It's not TOOOO spicy, but definitely has a kick. They give you two little things of it per burrito which is just enough to smother every bite in spicy goodness.   I look forward to dining in one day, but until then, I'll keep my to-go orders on a regular schedule!",

Everything here was amazing! It was 10:30am, so of course I had a margarita. They also bring you the My Nana's chips, salsa, and a chili sauce. The chili sauce was so damn good, I bought some on the way out. On Sundays, they also have a trio that wanders around playing Mexican music and creates an awesome atmosphere/experience. They stopped by our table and performed two songs, making me forget I'm a midwestern white boy for a few minutes.  I ordered the taco plate with all rice, no beans. That's my thing that I do. The tacos were perfect from the shells to the beef and melty cheese. The rice was Spanish rice and reminded me of the fried rice you'd get from an Asian restaurant. I loved it! It was very authentic, and now I have a new favorite Mexican restaurant!",

The food is always delicious, served hot and great flavor.   Today was a different experience all together. Sadly it was also my last.   We arrived at 2:50 and were seated right away. 3:10 still NO drinks and no one had even acknowledged we were sitting there.   Meanwhile two more couples showed up. They were both seated and promptly waited on. The couple that arrived just right after us had been served their food long before us.  At 3:30 I asked for the manager from the girl manning the call window. I told advised her of the situation and asked for our bill for our drinks. We were leaving.   She said the manager was in the back and would be with us shortly.   Our server showed up with our food. I told her we didn't want it and would take the bill for the drinks. She disappeared and for the next 10 minutes we sat.........waiting for the manager.  After the manager NEVER showed up to the table, I then asked for the manager again.  We were told there wouldn't be a charge for the drinks and he (the manager) was in the kitchen.   The manager proceeded to speak to me from across the kitchen saying he was packing our food for us to take with us.   I told him we don't want it and I asked him why he found it acceptable to not come speak with us after our initial request.   He said there was a \"mix up\" with out check \"and it had been misplaced.\"  So I asked why the server or himself didn't come out and communicate that to us. He said he was going to.   So let me get this right; you have customers sitting in the dining room for now 45 minutes, and you don't think you need to tell your customers what's going on????  Its ok for them to continue to wait even AFTER they've asked to speak to a manager. Even AFTER they've asked how much longer.   He handled the entire situation extremely unprofessionally. No apology.   He was extremely agitated  and aggressive when he spoke to us.   Nothing about this situation makes me feel like a valued customer.   Note: My family and I are caucasian. The couples that showed up after us and were served before us were not. The couple that received their food before us were not.   I'm very disappointed in the way management handled this whole situation!    Good bye to good food. SO LONG to feeling like we arent wanted.",

For my second visit, I had the chorizo, potato, egg burrito. It was brought to me as a nondescript, large burrito on a plate, with no garnish besides an orange slice. When I bit into it, it was heavenly! The flavor was rich and spicy, without overwhelming heat. There was a ton of chorizo and not a single drop of the heavy red grease that is in a lot of other chorizo. It was fresh, light, and fluffy. The potatoes were perfectly cooked. The cheese was perfectly melted throughout.  My husband had his burrito with chorizo, egg, potato, beans, and bacon. He thanked me for bringing him here ... I think we'll be coming back more often.  I was reminded why I loved this restaurant so much. Definitely five stars for the food and price.",

We have been on the East Coast for about 6 weeks and I need to get my fill.  Off to Yelp I go and found La Canasta.  Exactly what I am looking for.  A 1.5 mile walk later and I am at the front door.  Uh-oh.  What does that hand-written sign say?  Close at 8:00 PM.  Out comes the phone.  Exactly 8:00 PM.  I enter anyways.   They ask if I want food to go.  I said I would rather eat in.  No problem.  Grab a seat.  You just need to pay first.  No problem.  They took me in with no one else in the restaurant.   I quickly ordered and quickly had my food.  Most of it was too hot (temperature) to eat.  That is a good thing.  I went simple with a chicken taco and cheese enchilada.  The cook came out after 5 minutes and asked me if it was all good.  He encouraged me to use the salsa in the bottle as it was great.  It was.  Chips and salsa were super great.  Warm, light chips and 2 great salsas.  Iced Tea was alright.  Passable.  Not best ever, but good enough.  Service was great seeing that they let me in after they were shutting down.  This seems to be a family owned place that has been around for awhile.  Definitely worth the 3.0 mile walk in total.",

I was a little apprehensive, because it  has a little of the whole in the wall look to it, but I am usually happily surprised with the rougher looking establishments. I order the chicken chimichanga, which I believe is the yes way to judge a mexican restaurant.... it was probably one of the best I have ever had and if you know me, you know I LOVE mexican food. The service was great and there salsa was amazing.  I will definitely be going back!!",

Manager got super defensive and yelled at him. This is now the second friend of mine who has now declared to never return to this La Canasta location. Coincidentally, they are both named \"James\". Maybe La Canasta doesn't like guys named James. This last episode may be it for me too.

This worried me a bit because most other places (Matt's Big Breakfast for example) are still jumping. However, we were in between crowds. I ordered the green chile & eggs breakfast. It was awesome. I heard a guest ask if they had menudo, and they did. My guest and I, both suffering from mild hangovers, knew that menudo was just what we needed. We split a bowl between us, to which our server brought us a second bowl and extra condiments. (Thanks!!) I'm spoiled by my Grandmother who makes homemade menudo, so my expectations are kind of high. I was thrilled that La Canasta had their act together and served up an excellent bowl or red menudo.  I now have a place to bring friends & family for a really good Mexican breakfast. I look forward to checking them out for lunch & dinner entrees too.http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3068/3107975444_4907cb63ae_m.jpg",

It's always a treat to search out different restaurants and hope we find some winners along the way.  This one just hit the spot. Love family restaurants that have these enduring recipes that date back years and years.  Mama cooking at the stove feeding several kidlets some ethnic family dishes.  Then maybe one day some tells Mama to open up a restaurant and serve everyone, gringos, Mexicans, other ethnicities some of their best dishes.  I believe this is the place where it formed.  Not sure, but it makes a nice story.  Anyhow, it was tucked away in an area around downtown Phoenix.  On the outskirts.  Not a great neighborhood but that makes it even better.  I ordered the Chicken Chimichanga topped with lots of chunky guacamole, sour cream and cheese on top. On the side came the green Enchillada sauce.  It was the best I ever had.  Big chunks of very soft mild chillies were floating in the sauce.  Husband had the Chili  Relleno.  It was delectable and the batter was light and fluffy. Son had the grilled fish enchiladas which was also so good.  Our very lovely server was Brianna.  Not only was she efficient, she was adorable and had a super sense of humor.  We went about 1:30 PM on Saturday.  The place was packed.  P.S. the chips were great as well and the salsa.  Mild with huge chunks of tomatoes.  Will be back again when in Phoenix.",

I was seated right away but was not acknowledge for 10 minutes and the place was not busy. For me I ordered the typical Sonoran lunch which consisted of a Red Burrito rice and beans. So here it goes... the rice and beans were average you can't really mess those up! As for my Red Burrito it was more like train wreck coming out of Tijuana! The red chili tasted too pasty due to the fact they put too much flour in The red chili sauce that's what gives thickness to red chilies and green chilies in a lot of these Mexican restaurants. The thicker the chili sauce means too much flour! I can go on an on about my lunch but I like to be a nice guy on yelp! My Experience this time around was well below average! let's be fair I will come back in about 3 to 6 months after they get the new cook!",

But let me tell you I did t say anything to anyone because I got to see the owner act that way it wouldn't justify anything so I decided to review this place. I will never go there again and the only reason why we went there was that Guadalajara was closed on Monday and Tuesday and they have much better service and lunch specials",

It's always busy for lunch; service was adequate but nothing special.  A few months ago, in the late afternoon, service was non-existent.  The food is ok.  Standard \"for the gringos\" Mexican food.  Nothing special, but nothing to complain about, either.  Except come on - salsa is not a can of tomatoes and a can of green chilis with a few onions chopped up in a blender.   I'm on a quest to find excellent Sonoran food that I remember from 20-30+ years ago, but I've nearly come to the conclusion that is a hopeless quest - the great cooks have apparently all died.",

It was so big and kind of hard to put all my food into it.  My daughter had the beef tacos and the meat was so good and flavorful!! Overall it was great and not very expensive for the amount of food you get. I will definitely go here again and recommend to everyone!",

Our waiter was well versed in the menu options and helped me out with what I deemed \"the taco conundrum\" - which basically meant that I wanted the taco/rice/bean lunch combo but with an extra taco. He managed to hook it up with a marginal price increase, a move that was greatly appreciated by both my stomach and my wallet. If you want some traditional Mexican food and you're in downtown Phoenix, this is the spot for you.",

They have not done anything to improve the place as far as looks, food is still decent, but NOT the best around for sure. But when they charged us 6.00 for one beer it was not acceptable!  We each had two beers and that was 24.00!!!!!  Crazy.  I mean these were Coors Light beers, not a fancy imported beer! Did you add 14k gold to it or something????Wow, better rethink that.   I can get a 12 pack for less than 2 beers.  They also have new menu's, with MUCH HIGHER PRICES.  Will not be going back.  Lost a good customer.  This is not a 5 STAR place, it is a dump with decent food. Beware of the much higher prices before you go!!!!  Go to a NICE Mexican restaurant for the ambience if you are gonna pay these high prices.  Sorry La Canasta.  But you are NOT worth it.",
