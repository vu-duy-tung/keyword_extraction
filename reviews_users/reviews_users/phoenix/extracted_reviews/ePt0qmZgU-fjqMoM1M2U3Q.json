    "text": "A friend took me here when I was in Scottsdale for work and he set the expectation in the car that this place was \"a bit weird\" and that \"I might not like it\", I went into it with low expectations and really no idea what to expect, a how bizarre could a sushi place really be. However, since he was the one driving and it was my second day in town, I didn't know anywhere we could go and was basically at his mercy so off we went.  That being said, once we pulled into the parking lot I got what he meant about \"a bit weird\", as the place was sandwiched in a corner of a strip mall that was more or less empty (we got there around 845). I was a bit apprehensive as we talked in, but the hostess seated us quickly and seated us in the back in a comfy booth that we requested. She patiently explained the menu and the specials and everything she mentioned sounded great. We settled on 4 rolls between the two of us, as well as some edamame and spring rolls and it was more than enough and we had plenty of leftovers. I couldn't speak to exactly what rolls we got (one with shrimp, one with eel and two others I'm blanking on), but I can tell you it was some of the best sushi I've ever had. Super fresh, made right in front of us and the chef came over to check on us and make sure that everything was how we wanted it.   The bill came out to around 60 between the two of us and we massively over ordered. 4 stars only being the ambiance is a bit weird and strip mall like, but worth it for the food. Wouldn't recommend it for a first date, but a good place for friends to catch up and enjoy some great sushi!",

Original: I order the yellow curry as well and thought I was ordering Thai curry but was given Chinese curry or something else. I didn't like it but the owner refunded me the amount for that plate without me asking for that, so that was nice.",

    "text": "We went here for dinner (It was Christmas night). Love that they have bike racks right outside the restaurant - we rode our bikes there on the greenbelt and it was super convenient. We were seated right away even though the hostess seemed unsure she could seat us since we didn't have reservations.  The service was friendly and efficient, but lacked basic things like silverware (we had to ask for it) and napkins (we also had to ask for them but they were never brought) The food was good and I honestly was skeptical of the different cuisines served (sushi, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai) but my sushi was pretty good and my date's Kung Pao Chicken got a thumbs up. The pad thai and curry looked really good too and I couldn't decide between Thai and sushi -- sushi ended up winning.  Will be back for happy hour. Hoping that the subpar service was because it was a busy night. Next time I'll be trying the Thai!",

This location offers EXTREMELY, perfectly executed AND authentic sushi, Vietnamese,  Thai AND Chinese dishes!!!!

I was a bit scared as the ratings for pho didn't seem that great and pho to go is always a let down. But it was one of the desperation things.   I was extremely pleasantly surprised. It was large enough for me to eat two meals from so that was nice. The flavor was delicious. The only complaint would be no jalapenos, but I had a fresh one at home so it worked out.

Decent sized, nice crispy outside and flavorful filling. The dipping sauce mint and lettuce added to the enjoyment although I think that the dipping sauce was slightly too sweet .  The  Beef Pho: Soggy overcooked noodles that were stuck together in a unappealing clump, thick chewy pieces of overcooked beef (it's supposed to come raw and very thinly sliced),no lime, small amounts of bean sprouts and flimsy, wilted garnishments and funky unpalatable broth. Can't believe they call this pho. It's not. I've had amazing pho from all over, even semi-amazing pho, and this place was very disappointing in comparison.  Soft Drinks: They didn't put them in our bag. $4+tax wasted. I should have checked to make sure they were there, but still annoying none the less.  $27 later and I'm still craving pho. Boo.",

Now we were a little worried when we saw it was in a strip mall but the reviews were good so we went in.   My coworkers chose something if the lunch menu. They chose the Kang Keo Wan at different spice levels. I tried #3 and it had a little kick and was very good. I actually ordered the Pho with beef and meatballs. It was delicious. I added more spice because I like it a little spicy and the broth was flavorful. I didn't really care for the meatballs but the beef strips were good.   Now there was an issue with my order and it took longer to come out. My coworkers started eating their meals while I waited. I didn't mind because Blake had already given me a free bowl of egg drop soup and apologized for the mishap. He also brought me some ice cream to take with me. He is very polite and professional so it was really not a big deal. We will definitely be back.",

The one time I went for lunch they didn't have any of the dishes I asked for and the service both at dinner and at lunch is always lacking. Maybe the day i went in for lunch there was a problem in the kitchen or something but they could have told us that when we walked in. Again, the waitresses are ok but you have to flag them down for drink refills and they take their time getting your food to your table.But aside from that I would recommend dinner at Totties",

I am reasonably certain that all their food is good but I probably will never know as the only two items I get EVERY time I go are their spring rolls and their Beef Pho Tai soup!  It is that good!  The spring rolls have chunks of pork and fresh shrimp and are laced throughout with cilantro and rice.  They are amazing.  My boyfriend and I douse them thoroughly in their delicious peanut sauce that we doctor up with soy sauce, plum sance and a spicy red sauce.     Then we have the Pho Tai which seriously even  if I was a step away from death and sick with a cold I would still  drive to Totties to have instead of that crappy Campbells Chicken Noodle Soup.    The owner (Tottie- go figure!) told me that she makes the beef broth with beef marrow which sounds really gross until you have it.  There is an undescribable seasoning (marrow?) in the soup that is just delicious.   And that is another dish that you doctor right up- add a little bean sprouts, fresh mint, fresh cilantro, leetle bit of peanut sauce, soy sauce and you are done.  We practically want to scrape the bowl clean.  Being from Scottsdale and watching my girlish figure, it is pretty embarrassing that I am practically jabbing the boyfriend to get to the soup!  So that is it!  The new location is beautiful and I hope that they have great success there as it has more panache than their first location.  Yum!",

We usually get the Spring Rolls, a curry, and AVOCADO ice cream.  Always good service, I've gotten take out a couple times and once I ordered wrong and they corrected my mistake without charging me :) Definitely go.",

    "text": "as most people have noted here, tottie's is not asian fusion in the traditional definition of fusion cuisine. its dishes don't combine different cuisines into one experimental dish. tottie's offers chinese, viet, thai and sushi, but as separate dishes. but if you end up ordering a dish from each separate cuisine, you end up with a pan-asian meal. so in that sense, it's a meal fused from different cultures.  i recommend this place if you're with a group of people who all want different things and can't decide on a specific asian cuisine. tottie's does each cuisine fine, though not spectacular. i would say that in each cuisine, tottie's is better than most places in phoenix that do just thai, or sushi, etc.   the sushi fish was fresh, and the rolls were a good size. the thai curries are big enough for two, and they don't charge extra for rice (which is nice). the waitstaff is very nice.   this place is a solid good eatery. i can't give it 4 stars because i feel if it concentrated on one cuisine, it could excel and be at the top of that cuisine. but i also wouldn't change much of anything here (except maybe they should take down the outdated shanghai gourmet reviews in the windows -- very misleading).",

Everything we had was delicious (and unique, to us at least) from the Larb, to the spicy pickled cucumbers. The Pad Thai was wonderful as well. Our favorite by far, however, and large enough to feed 2-4 people alone was the Seafood Soup. The flavors were powerful and delectable. We were full for like two days, haha. Great service too. We went at 5pm on a Sat. night and we basically had the place to ourselves. It was very busy by 7pm. When we're back in that area, there is no doubt we will go there again!  Not expensive, very reasonably priced, ESPECIALLY considering how much food we had (and had left over). Reservations recommended.",

    "text": "I gotta say, I might be the only one, but I just wasn't that blown away with this place.  Having just moved to the area, I was very excited to find out we had a sushi joint within a mile of our home.  I was even more excited when I read the other reviews on here.  Of course, no one reviewed the sushi yet.  We has been in the pool all day and were looking for something that we could bring back home.  We stopped in, grabbed a sushi menu and headed for the waiting area framed by this amazing crystal dragon.  We spent about 5 minutes just discussing this dragon and how much we wanted to touch it but were sure we would ruin it and the Tottie's SWAT would come looking for us.  After reviewing the menu I noticed that the selection was much smaller than some other places.  We opted for 4 rolls and salmon nigiri.  We waited around for awhile and I think the hostesses forgot about us because they finally walked back to check on someone else, saw me and said Oh!  You're sushi is ready at the front.  We grab it, pay $42 and head home - less than 2 minutes.  I get home to see that the sushi is small - smaller than what you get at the grocery store with very very little actual fish in it.  The avocado was turning slightly brown (probably from the wait up front) and it just didn't make me say Wow at all.  We ate it (well, most of it) because we were hungry but I have to say I don't think I will be getting sushi from there again.  Maybe it was an off night, I just wouldn't recommend it.  Expecially not for that price.  I would have been better going off to Ra.    However, its cute inside and I like the crystal dragon so they get 2 stars.  Maybe I'll go back sometime and try some of the other food people are raving about.",

They've even added brown rice to the offerings after years of harrassment from yours truly :-)  The lunch specials are great for a business lunch - though they can get busy now.  Also a new Happy Hour (three of them really): 4-7pm.  I agree service quality does tend to vary but it's part of a small business growing.  I am usually with people I want to talk with so it's never an issue.  I am glad we have an asset like this place in the neighborhood and never get sick of trying out the menu (which BTW you aren't limited to if you're open to Tottie's suggestions!).",

After sitting for a long while, one of staff finally said it took so long because they were taking care of catering order instead of getting our main food out.  Food: We started off with spring rolls and it was not great.  The wrapper was hard and sauce was not your traditional spring roll sauce.  The egg rolls was also burnt on the outside and wasn't that great either.  I also ordered Tom yum soup and the flavor was totally off.  It was dark, heavy and was salty.  It did not taste like any other Thai Tom yum soup.  The curry was just ok compared to other Thai restaurant and a bit more sweeter.  As far as the pho noodle, it was definitely off nothing like your traditional pho restaurant.  The flavor is strange and noodle were bit hard.  The siracha and hoison sauce were not served from bottle instead it was poured into small ramekins. Lastly, we also ordered Chiangmai noodle, the noodle was hard and the sauce especially was really off.  It was way too thick, salty and to kill the taste we had to add spice but still was not good.  This is my last visit here!! If you want authentic Thai food or any other fusion of ASIAN food, I would recommend elsewhere!",

The shrimp Rangoon  sounded like a surefire win and I don't know how it's possible but they added whatever it took to ruin deep fried shrimp and cream cheese.    This place was SHOCKINGLY bad.

Friendly efficient service executed in the comfort of the prototypical and stereotypical strip mall setting.  I ordered the Pad Thai, one of my Asian barometers, and it fit in the middle of my bell curve.  Not exceptional but pretty good. The egg rolls were solid.  There were some other interesting items on the menu that definitely merit a  couple of additional visits in hopes that this can become part of the regular area rotation.   I am in  the market of a 'go-to' spot for Asian.",

All the times I have been there, there had never been a wait and they are never too busy which is nice. They have a pretty large menu with all different kinds of food: Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, etc.  I've only ever ordered off the Thai menu, but it has been very good.  My mom and I got a few dishes to split and the portions were huge. We took home plenty of left overs.    We order the Panang and the seafood curry. Both were delicious and had great flavor. My mom isn't a huge fan of spice, so we got the dishes at medium and sometimes they can be bland but they had all the flavor and none of the heat.  I've also ordered the Pad Thai and the Pad Se Ew and they were both great dishes as well. The dishes tend to be very traditional and the staff is very attentive.",

Aside from that, Tottie, I love you long time!  Good, dark and elegant place for a date, or affair, Tottie, and you could make a great meal from just the appetizers. Order a Pu Pu. Huh-huh!   The Tottie Rolls, with sauce and lettuce wrap are great and if you're lucky and it's late, Tottie will prepare them for you and feed them to you while her womanly chest heaves with desire, using food as one would join in human sexual desire. But I digress.  All the dishes are terrific but I wish the Pad Thai was not as mushy. If you do have any complaints, Tottie is always the lady and restaurateur and will treat your complaint with patience and kindness or perhaps a spanking and some rough stuff before she forces your head into the plate of Pad Thai by lying prone on your back, squirting that Scrimshaw sauce, or whatever they call it, into your nasal cavity and belittling you in Chinese because you've been a naughty, naughty boy. But I digress  For dessert, I highly recommend the coconut ice cream with fried honey bananas. Your banana will be surprisingly hot and Tottie likes it that way. That's how she serves the bananas in her place.  I didn't care for the incredible wait at the Paradise Valley location, but hopefully Tottie will have more openings for us all. But I digress.",

The lunch special comes with soup and an egg roll.  The ambiance is nice.

We ate family-style, and I had the privilege to enjoy the Tom Ka Gai, Green Papaya Salad, and Chicken Panang.   The waitress was accommodating, funny, and seemingly sincere with her candor. Once the Tom Ka Gai came out, and the delicious broth filled my mouth, I am pretty sure my body went into some kind of shock - there was nothing else going on in the world, except the flavor explosion in my mouth!   It was spicy, yet creamy, and FLAVORFUL! I still frequently fantasize about this soup. The chicken wasn't sparse, and I am actually drooling, just thinking about it.  The Panang and Green Papaya were equally delicious. Not to the Tom Ka Gai (the obsession is truly an unhealthy one), but to each other. It depends on what you're in the mood for... But the Panang sauce combined with chicken and rice made for a delicious meal, and even a not-so-guilt-free breakfast the next day. The Green Papaya Salad was served with grilled chicken and sticky rice. The cool salad was crispy and combined well with the chargrilled chicken.  I can't wait to try more, and hope you enjoy it, if you try (Tom Ka Gai) anything on the menu! I am positive you'll find anything there enjoyable. There is a wide variety of Pan Asian cuisine to delight your tastebuds.",

They have traditionally allowed regular menu items as lunch specials when not listed, especially when they were offered as lunch specials in the past.  Like I said, over eight years I have seen several lunch menus.  Today, I asked for the Sesame Chicken (my favorite) and was told that could not be offered as a lunch special, only as a full-priced dinner item.  My next lunch menu option was not what I expected and I was disappointed (cashew chicken).  With the multitude of restaurants in the area, I need to find another Asian Food location for the future.  Any suggestions?",

Service is usually pretty good, although the last time I went and brought friends our waitress was all over the place and we waited a long time for our food. But hey, 1 out of 10 times or so isn't that bad. Plus, the staff knows the menu pretty well and they make really good recommendations.   The Thai portion of the menu is the best and definitely comes with the most food. I like the Kang Keo Wang: a mix of chicken (you choose which meat) and vegetables in a delicious green curry sauce., and the Chiang Mai Noodles--similar to the Kang Keo Wan but has more of a coconut taste to it. They also let you choose your spice level:1-10. 4 is about the spiciness of a jalapeno. You can also ask them to cut down on the sugar, if you feel like being healthy.",

We wanted to do our annual picnic but alas the weather was acting funny so we decided to head over for some yummy Thai food since that is what I was currently craving.  It was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon, but then again they do not offer the lunch specials I have heard so much about on the weekends and sushi is not available until 6pm. Sad to say the least, but it did not deter us. We ordered some veggie spring rolls to share and after looking over the menu, can you believe all I ended up ordering was Pad Thai? Sad but that is what I really wanted. Jill ordered a yummy curry dish that had me wishing I had ordered some Panang but no worries as there will be a next time. OMG! The portions were HUGE. From the biggest veggie spring rolls I have ever seen to the massive portion of Pad Thai. I was in food heaven. Of course after a few bites I was like ok, time to wrap it up because I just couldn't eat anymore, but let me just say that the next day, my leftovers were spectacular. Especially since I had my Pad Thai extra, extra, extra spicy. Yummy indeed. Of course we washed it all down with some yummy Thai iced tea. I mean with all that spice, you need something cool to help soothe your tongue right.  I will definitely try to make it to one of the locations for their lunchtime special but in the meantime, if you are craving some Thai, definitely check this place out. You will not be disappointed.",

After that I tried it, and I'm now a big fan.   The food is a little bit of everything Asian. Thai is their specialty, but everything on the menu is good. Actually, my only complaint is that the menu is way too big. It's way too hard to decide what you want.   I really love the Pad Thai. If you're not into hot food, watch out.  We had it medium and it still had a good kick (medium was not my choice, I would've gone for more heat).  For an appetizer I highly recommend the Vietnamese spring rolls (with an amazing peanut sauce). I also highly recommend the Tottie Rolls. It's a fried pork roll with a lettuce wrap and mint leaves.  The menu says they're the best rolls you ever had. They may be right!",

There was no way I could finish the large bowl it was served in.  The egg rolls were fresh and most tasty wrapped in the lettuce with a sprig of mint.  The sushi was fine but nothing over the top.    If you want sushi, go to a sushi bar.  Overall, a pleasant and tasty meal.  At least you can have conversation and not have to yell.",

We had eaten here previously when it was Shanghai Palace and the food and service were exceptional. Now that they've expanded they need to do some work to get their act together.   Our server was nice, but way overworked. Being very hungry we ordered and appetizer right away and were promptly informed it would take 15 minutes. That was okay and we were willing to wait. When 15 minutes turned into almost 45 minutes we weren't very happy.   After mentioning something to our server everything miraculously appeared. It was almost as if they were throwing the food at us. Again, it wasn't our servers fault she was helping out two people who had just started.   All in all the food was very good and I would have given it four-five stars if the service had been better. There's a wide variety of very good Asian food so don't hesitate to try Tottie's, just about anyone can find something to please their palate.   We will give Tottie's another try too, we just hope they can get their house in order to make for a more pleasant dining experience.",

The only downside is that sushi isn't always available, but the quick service, perfectly cooked rice, mouthwatering sauces, and great selection in different cuisines makes up for it by far. And I prefer places that will wait for their sushi guy to come in at night to make a perfectly balanced and delicious roll!",

The vegetables are very fresh and not over cooked. The carry-out service was accommodating (split the bill for each person's order). When we opened the bags we were surprised to see that they individually wrapped each entree in a separate bag to avoid spilling. The entrees were flavorful, but not overpowering. Will definitely return and be more daring on my selection.",

Since I ordered the food to go, they wanted an extra dollar for the soup that is included with their lunch specials...WTF(?)  When I arrived to pick up my food, it took nearly 5 minutes to be acknowledged, and no, they were not busy.  And when I paid, I was charged $6.50 instead of the $5.95 that is listed on their online menu.  Rather than arguing over the amount as I was on my lunch break, I paid the bill and left.  Once I arrived back at the office and opened the bag, everything had spilled all over the inside of the bag.  What I could salvage was flavorless and greasy.  I threw it out and had wished I had never given this shit hole place a chance.  I would never return again.  The only fusion they offer is the fusion of shitty service and even shittier food.",

    "text": "I ordered takeout with my family and our experience with Tottie's Asian Fusion was mediocre at best.  With the name Tottie's Asian \"FUSION\" you usually expect a new, and exciting take of two cuisines blended together.  However when you look at the menu, it is clear that it is just a standard asian restaurant menu.  We started our meal with the Wonton Soup which we all admitted was not bad.  Had plenty of meat and nice wontons.  We also ordered Shrimp Tempura Spring Rolls which might as well have been just lettuce wrapped up in rice paper.  The ratio of veggies/cabbage to shrimp was absurd, and if you told me shrimp was in there I would told you to \"GET OUTTA HEEEERREEE!\"  For the entree, I had the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce.  It was ok but lacked any seasoning or flavor; a theme that frequently reared it's head throughout the meal.  My mom's House Chow Fun was similar:  OK, but not anything that would wow you for the price.  Finally my dad had the Beef Chop Suey which was bland, and had no sauce what so ever.  It may however  had sauce when boxed up, but I am not sure as the boxes the entrees where packed in were flimsy styrofoam containers that leaked and kept our food nice and....\"warm\".  We did order a Tottie's Fried Rice, however they forgot to include it in the bag.  My mom did call in and they were very quick to apologize and credit our account which I appreciate.  Overall, we found the food to not be worth the price charged.  Mediocre asian food, however if you are the only show in town (aside from P.F. Chang and Pei Wei), you can often get away with that.  Maybe the food is better in the restaurant, however I doubt my family will be back to try and find out.",

But I have to say, I love Tottie's, if for no other reason than the Green Curry.  It is easily one of my favorite dishes right now.  I've tried both the lemon and tangerine chicken (apparently I could not live without citrus), and while good, they cannot compete with the green curry.  Generally I would prefer Chinese to Thai, or so I thought.  I know, it's like comparing apples to oranges.  I also really like the Tottie rolls.  The spring rolls taught me I'm not a fan of rice paper, but I loved the peanut sauce.  Anything dipped in that peanut sauce would be good!  Given its location,  I was pleasantly surprised that Tottie's is actually quite nice inside, although we usually get take-out.  In fact, today is quite chilly.  I think that curry is calling me.",

The fried egg roll appetizer was very good with plenty of pork filling. The pad see ew was over spiced with what I believe is basil, but a very large portion.  They give plenty of beef and broccoli in the pad see ew, but not enough noodles, I would have preferred a little more.  I also like how they ask what level of spice you'd like, 0 - 10; after ordering a level 2, there was barely any spice to it, I can't imagine what a 0 would be, nor could I imagine the level of spice in a 10.",

My favs are a lot of their spicy sauces and curries. Must try if you like asian food!

This place is a hidden gem and has the best fusion and selection of the best Asian dishes! We went on Xmas eve and the service was awesome the whole restaurant was way larger than it seemed from looking at its outside exterior. Full bar and several tables to make it intimate. Staff was super friendly. I recommend the chow fun with shrimp and firecracker chicken. Everything is so good on the menu. Must go if you love Asian food from Vietnamese to Chinese to a little Korean flare.",

I always go in thinking \"oh maybe I'll try something new and different this time\" but the moment I sit down...nope, spring rolls and either Pho or Pad Thai. Their food isn't the absolute best I've ever had....but somehow, Tottie's is my favorite. Don't know how that works. My best friend always gets the Tottie rolls, which are also really good too. I'd say this location is better than the Scottsdale Rd. location, due to better service and a more laid back atmosphere.",

Really good dish and I have plenty of left overs as the portion sizes are large. My husband had the pad ka pau and it was good but he likes another places better. Overall great experience and the server was always on top of everything and ready to get anything we needed. Will come back again.",

That was delicious, next time I'll need to try something else on the Chinese part of the menu.

Fusion means the combination of two or more cuisines in ONE DISH.  This place simply offers Thai, Sushi, Chinese and Vietname all SEPARATELY.  It is more like food court or buffet in that it offers many different options.  I ordered my default dish when I am not that hungry.  The sweat and sour chicken was mediocre.  If that was the only food item I tried I would not come back.  Fortunately I was with a group and got to try the green curry and lemon grass chicken which was pretty tasty.  What enjoyed most was they way they spiced it up.  You can choose how spicey you want your dish (between 1-10) and whatever they use adds a lot of taste and the approprirate balance of heat.",

I feel like they use the same 3 ingredients in every dish, as if they don't want to actually supply the ingredients that the dishes need. Everything tastes ok, but just really off. Maybe that it was they mean by 'fusion'? Fusing Asian food with random meh flavor?  The staff here is pretty disappointing, also, which is the main reason why I don't return. I have tried eating here probably 5 or 6 times between dining in and taking out. The last time was so disappointing. I was second hand embarrassed for this restaurant. Their staff that night, of 4 or 5 twenty-somethings, all stood at the front of the restaurant talking loudly about idiotic things they had done over the weekend. My boyfriend and i couldnt even have a conversation because we could hear ever single word they were saying. So rude. And annoying. Honestly, they spent a good 35 minutes doing this(the entire time we were there, I'm sure they kept going even after we left). It was sad really, that a business would tolerate this kind of behavior from their employees. My first job at Pizza Hut when I was 16 wouldn't even allow that kind of BS.  So, basically, their meh food doesn't make up for their UGH service, therefore making take out not worth it, and dining in miserable. Sorry Totti :(",

We went there for lunch and most waiters were very young and untrained.   Nothing against being young, but they didn't know how to be a good waiter.  First they forgot about our table and didn't come to get our order for 15 min.  After they brought our food, they never came to check if we had enough water to re-fill it. We made small modification to one of the dishes and they put the extra veggies in the wrong dish.  Waiters were courteous, but green.  They just need to be trained better.  Food was subpar.  We are from Seattle area, so we are accustomed to higher quality Asian dishes. Maybe the folks who gave this place higher star haven't had really good Asian food to compare against.",

Since the major decoration about a year ago, I average eating here at least once every other week, even when I worked here.  Tottie has managed to create a place that is simply her--fabulous.

Last time we went my boyfriend ordered some sushi, we got dumplings, and just hung out. My boyfriend said the sushi is \"alright\" but way over priced. Nothing compared to other sushi we have had in the valley (can I mention Celcius next to dessert ridge here? Delicious). The dumplings were a big disappointment. Not only did we have to wait 15 minutes because they were steamed. Way tasteless little things. The wrapper was all chewy. I'll never order it again. We also ordered egg rolls, and I think that was the best part of the entire night.  Meh. I probably won't be back. Even though it's walking distance from my apartment.

When we got there we had to wait 15 min for anyone to come to greet us and once we been seated we had waited another 15 min for a waitress to take our order. The hot tea was like plain hot water. We order two appetizer and two entrees the what so call best egg roll you've ever tasted was like the worst egg roll I've ever tasted in my life it was so soggy inside! The scewred beef was tasteless.  The house special chowmein was anything but special.  And the shrimp green bean and black bean sauce was terrible the shrimp tasted like dirt and green beans was from a frozen pre cooked bag. So so disappointed . How does this place get such good reviews I don't get it??!",

Tottie egg rolls are decent. Dipping sauce is purely fish sauce so if you're not Asian, ask for sweet and sour sauce. Pho broth is ok but you can mask bland with sriracha. Side note, boiling oxtail shouldn't be rocket science. For the price, I have had better especially when there was a rumble in my tummy. If it wasn't the rent for space, I think Scottsdale would be flooded with noodle houses. East Valley definitely has got this down.",

After ordering 5 chicken dishes for takeout, all five of us quickly came to the conclusion that there was almost zero chicken in any of our meals (2-4 pieces tiny per dish). We called to let them know when we were met with rude skepticism of our claims. They asked if it was just one dish, to which I told them it was all 5 of them. They offered to comp 1 dish and I replied that if they comped 2 that would be fine. They then replied that they would only comp 1...I said thank you and hung up. I usually would be very forgiving for the problems with the food, but the complete lack of decent service prompted me to make this review to warn others.",

Anyway - The sushi is still fantastic, the menu drink options are well chosen, and I LOVE the restaurant decor/aesthetics. Now onto the the sadness...  The food is lacking flavor now. Everything is just...blah. Again, this pains me because I really used to like this place. I suppose, since I have gone all over the Valley in search of the perfect Thai Curries (I swear, I have found them) this place no longer holds up.  Still, I'll be back for the sushi and house wines served up by kind people in a great looking place.  1 star for each of its merits.",

But then we sat down and I was overtaken with it's extensive menu--they not only have sushi but Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese. They have a lot of different sushi rolls and also gives you a description of each one (One of them things most sushi places do which drives me batty!) Service was on point and quick to take our order and get anything we needed. I got the Flaming Tuna Roll and Broadway Roll and both were fresh and full of flavor. I love spicy stuff and the Broadway is not for the faint of heart--be sure to have some water nearby if you're going to try this one.  The only thing I disliked about Tottie's is that I live on the other side of the country and can't go back there any time I want, sadface.",

We have brought at least 15 of our best friends and family and they love it too.  They have chinese selections, and have different chefs tending to different regions.  They Sushi guy rocks it too. Dessert calls for mango sticky rice or one of their sumptuous home made ice creams. This is a family owned place, and they have opened another one a it further north on Scottsdale Rd.

I'm sure it probably tastes really good for ppl who like it, but it's like comparing little Caesars to hungry howies. Yeah, they're both pizza, but they taste fundamentally different. The serving sizes were bountiful, it was all hot and looked good. But when you have a specific flavor in mind and what you're eating just doesn't match up its hard to enjoy. This is more about me than anything. But I think people who are looking for flavors that line up with Thai Rama or Thai Basil, you're not going to get that here. I would be interested in trying some of their other again dishes, just not their thai selection.",

I don't drink with dinner but here it was happy hour all day sat, and they had a unique drink the Curry Gimlet, IT comes in a martini glass has a orange hue, it is fruity but has a curry finish from cardamom I assume, truly unique.  Our dishes of Pad See ewe and Dragon noodles were great, and huge portions.   Rich flavors, well textured tofu and crisp veggies.

They did take one of the pots of soup off the bill, but they weren't terribly busy and service was not Swift to say the least. Two of the other entrees were pretty good, so there's that. If they wanted me to come back and try them for a third time, they really should've taken both soups off the bill, as they could see from the contents of both parts that they had barely been touched as it. As it is, I'm not going back. Far too many other places that have a better soup then even the first time we were there to consider it. How they're on Phoenix top 100 list?

    "text": "I saw the Check Please, Arizona that featured Tottie's and arrived with high expectations. We were seated promptly and water war provided as well. Our waitress was very busy and doing a heroic job, however service was spotty as a result. It's the food that was the major disappointment. The first couple of things we wanted from the printed menu had been discontinued, bummer but we adapted. We ordered the traditional spring rolls with shrimp and pork. I found the pork but couldn't find the shrimp. In every other shrimp spring roll I have ordered the shrimp was plainly visible, even highlighted. Just fair.  The next was the Tom Kha Gai soup. ordered it 5 of 7 on a spicy scale and it wasn't spicy at all and barely warmed. It is obvious that they pre-make this soup and just reheat it to order and not completely in our case. It was served in one of those sterno powered hot pot warmers. The soup was better after it warmed a while although the ladle given was too wide to actually fit in the soup trough, made seconds problematic. Just fair,  Spicy Thai Seafood had all the ingredients but was ordered a 5 and it came out a 1 on a spicy scale. Not very attractive was garnished with a few carrot slices sort of feathered on one side. Knife work poor overall. Disappointing.  Lemon grass stir-fry was the same disappointing plate hard to distinguish from my Spicy Thai Seafood in looks. Ordered a 5 and came out barely a one, again on the Spice scale Disappointing.  It's a disservice if the photography of a TV Show has vivid and beautiful colors with artistic knife work and the real version isn't even up to Pandas Express standards.  Not terrible but disappointing. No owner or manager were seen, the place was just running by itself and not too well at that.",

    "text": "6/15/16  Mom and I haven't been to this location in a long time, as we go to one on Scottsdale Rd. (between McDonald and Lincoln, and listed in Paradise Valley) since it is closer to where we live.  We noticed that this location is less-busy than the other, which isn't telling much, as the other location doesn't get very busy either, at least not at the times when we go, which usually is around happy hour/before 6 pm.  At the time of our arrival, around 5 pm, there was only one Caucasian woman seating and serving the entire restaurant-- about six different parties, two of which arrived before ours.  She seemed very busy, taking large strides, almost-sprinting, and trying to get water glasses to the tables and answering questions.  By the time we'd placed our orders it was around 5:20 pm.  At 5:25 pm, a second employee, a young Asian man, walked in.  Ah, more needed help has arrived.  Thai iced tea:  Good, but very sweet.  Make sure to order an extra glass of ice to pour into to help lessen the sweetness level! <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=k_gUwf5hGjiGEJ-TUaP2RA&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Guava mimosa:  Listed on the happy hour menu, under Tropical Mimosas, for $5.  Other options include mango, lychee, and pineapple!  Very happy to see this offering, as I am allergic to oranges, so I normally avoid mimosas.  I've only seen grapefruit** mimosas offered elsewhere, so to see guava and lychee as additional choices impresses me!  I'll be back just to try the other choices.  Btw, the guava was good, but it could've used a little more sweetness.  I sipped this one first, before trying the Thai iced tea, just to check its sweetness level.  I suggest adding sugar to taste, or perhaps Tottie's could offer a moscato d'asti as a sweeter alternative to the sparkling wine that is used.  Green curry with beef:  Delicious, with good-quality beef (tender, and not sinewy), but the curry was too watery. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=DVLvAWTrbWqmlSOn4r2zfQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Love that the veggies included can be omitted and substituted according to food issues/allergies.  Also love that Tottie's offers steamed egg noodles as an additional side for someone like me who is allergic to rice.  Price for side noodles has increased to $3.50 a bowl, when it was only $2 a year, or two ago.  Almost double the original price, but still somewhat reasonable.  If the cost of the noodles were to increase even more AND the curry remains watery (as opposed to silky), I may have to look elsewhere for my green curry and egg noodle fix.   Soft-shelled crab curry! <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OcU0raJQ6HsfVLf0jaBI7g&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  This was the dish that brought Mom and me back again and again.  I've decided to stay away from crab this year, as the last time I had it, my allergy symptoms were worse.  Simply not worth the pain and suffering.  Mom enjoyed this dish, and it looked beautiful.  We did notice that it came with less crab pieces (four halves, instead of the previous six-- check out my older photos).  It's been awhile since we last visited, so it would be nice if the menu listed the number of pieces, as well as the cost of additional crab ($3 each, and sliced into halves).  Note that you may want to ask for a few pieces placed on the side, if you intend to take leftovers home-- that way, you may revive them in the (toaster) oven and will not soggy upon re-heat!  Will probably just go to the one on Scottsdale Rd. from now on, since we like the Filipina server there.  We also usually see Tottie herself roaming around, and she usually comes and greets us, which is always a nice touch.",

    "text": "Wow , after dining here about 20 times since we moved here about two years ago I never thought I would be posting a poor review here . We can in three of us , it was quite busy at the time . Waited in line about 10 minutes , while a disgruntled to go order recipient tried to get it fixed . I guess the owner swung by and said 5 minutes , ok , I'm in the business I know it's looking like they weren't ready for this amount of business , it happens , I more than understand . The young host finally took us back to a booth , but when we arrived it was not finished being cleaned etc... no big deal , I start to kind of wipe down surface , when the man whom I assume is the owner came over extremely rude and told my wife , you three over there , just go over there as he glared at the host who sat us . We went and stood by the bar and watched him walk past us about 15 more times , as we could see the table had been finished for us , but he or anyone said nothing , so my wife had enough , she loves Totties , but being treated like that is unacceptable at any business . We left , I am and have been in the hospitality business 35 years in every aspect , I've seen plenty , this was one of our favorites and living about 100 yards away made it even better . Treating customers like that will always start the downfall of a place even with the wonderful food served by Totties , we will surely miss that spot",

I brought it my server's attention and she said it would take too long to replace the meal and insinuated I just had to deal with it!  I was shocked.  It was quite busy but to make no attempt to remedy the situation shocked me.  I should have been the one to make the call to wait or not.  Plus she really should have asked the kitchen to rush my reorder. The other 3 people I was with ate their meal and we left.  They were quite uncomfortable with the situation as well. I really would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  .",

Had a party of 12 at the restaurant and was given a gift worth about $200 we were the last ones in there and I left the gift right on top of the table. I called the restaurant  After we left and left a message on tree voicemail. I called the next morning before lunch and was told they were getting ready for lunch and would call me back but the person who answered was sure that it was there  and would get back to me shortly. I never got a call back. I called at night and was told sorry there's nothing they could do they could not find it. If it was morning I could have gone in and searched but I was put off. No one has called to apologize or discuss any remedy for the situation. I have not heard from the wait staff nor the owner. In my opinion this is terrible behavior. The item was on the smaller side but certainly was large enough that it  could not be overlooked.   It was right on top of the table. If someone threw it out by accident I could have tried to fish it out of the garbage in the morning had they been responsive. I do not know if this was the case but no one has even said that they threw it out. They would know if they did.  The only reason this has one star is because you have to put 1 in in order to get on Yelp.",

For appetizers, I ordered the Spring Rolls (traditional with pork and shrimp). I figured they'd be like all other Thai/Viet spring rolls and they were, but I wonder if the pork is fried and breaded. So after eating it I experienced a bit of intestinal discomfort. My bad for not asking. They were really good. For my main dish I ordered the Pad Thai and it was really wonderful. Have enough leftover for lunch today and maybe tomorrow. The interior of this place is really something, very eclectic Asian. I would definitely come back!",

It's only about a mile and a half from my house so I figured I'd give it a try for some take-out. I'm really glad I did.  I arrived to a cute little restaurant with some great charm. I was greeted by the hostess and I placed my order for take-out. I ordered the Tom Kha Gai soup with chicken and the Sweet & Sour Chicken with steamed rice. She told me it would take about 10 minutes and there was a cute, relaxing waiting area in the middle of the restaurant I could wait in. They had magazines and a water feature to keep me occupied. About 10 minutes later she brought me my food and check to my little waiting area.   I got home and tried the Sweet & Sour Chicken. While it was good it was very light in flavor but very red in color. Still tasty though. The Tom Kha Gai soup was perfect. Perfect amount of spice (on a 1-7 spice level I choose 5ish). Perfect amount of veggies and chicken. The servings were large to share so I certainly have left-overs.   I can't wait to go back and either eat there or take-out again soon to try other items on the menu.   Great service and very tasty food!",

    "text": "So, I was feeling a little \"meh\" today, and decided some Thai soup would magically make me better.   I'm still regurgitating the soup as I write. It was like a Great Sea Monster came in my mouth. Salty, fishy -- though not much fish was actually in the broth -- and just an overall sense of death and despair. I liked the Bunsen burner in the middle of the bowl. It flickered and sent little sparks in the air. It was Tottie's way of evoking hell, and it was pretty ingenious.   I'd describe the color of the soup as \"menstrual.\" A muddy brown-red that complimented the over-cooked flakes of fish. The fish, like so many of us, had just given up. There was no point in being irresistible anymore, swimming in a hot sea of salty discharge.   I waited so long just to flag down the waiter so I could get a glass of water to wash the taste of regret out of mouth. As the minutes rolled by, I thought about things: the brevity of life, how 1 hour and 20 minutes have gone by that I'll never back, if the guy across from me was flirting with me...maybe not. Ok, let's just say he was.   A waitress came at last with a glass of water, which I chugged. She asked if I wanted to take the soup home, but I decided to leave it and have it donated to people who are feeling bad about themselves. I might come back on Ash Wednesday, or  when I need to punish myself, or experience my own personal Apocalypse in the comfort of an Asian restaurant.",

Reminded of me Shea Garden my mother used to take us too when we were wee lads.  For dessert we had the Rocky Road ice cream, awesome!

I always have enough curry to last at least 2 more lunches!  So for $8.00, I have lunch for 3 days.    I've turned on a lot of co-workers to Totties and we now have \"Thai Tuesdays\" on a somewhat regular basis, and we get Tottie's to-go.

People and restaurants have 'off' days and I must have just gone there on an 'off' day. It happens.  NOW, I get the hoopla!  So delicious.  My Tom Kom Gai was rich and creamy and had tons of chicken this time.  the Chicken Panang was also outstanding.  Spicy, crunchy vegetables, tender chicken.  This will now definitely be my Thai takeout place and I am now eager to try the sushi as well.  Not only is the food delicious, but a restaurant that goes out of it's way to correct a error?  That's rare and I greatly appreciate it.  Thanks Mark!",

We got the combination appetizer plate which came with an array of different sauces which were all very good (adding a little hot sauce to the peanut sauce was a very good choice on their part). It came with a lot of fried items, the exception being the BBQ ribs which were very tender and juicy with a great, flavorful sauce, and the skewered beef which was a bit over seasoned which I was not a fan of. After we shared the Panang with shrimp. The Panang was very flavorful (their medium is kind of spicy so be wary of that) and was full of vegetables and about a handful of large shrimp. Their Thai ice coffee is wonderful, a very good balance of spice to coffee and cream.  The only thing I can say is really off about this place is the service. While our waitress was nice enough and came by often enough I wonder if she knew that we could hear her scoffing about us while she was standing behind the bar about 10 feet away. I can understand that not everyone likes everyone and that people like to talk about their customers but please keep a professional attitude, at least until you're in the kitchen/back room.",

I was wanting to try some of the appetizers...but at about ~$6-10/pop....and wanting to get a meal (guessing you could probably do an appetizer as a meal), that wasn't going to happen.  I noticed the \"Bun Tom\" on the menu...seemed to be a good combo of food and included some \"Tottie Rolls\" which I wanted to try.  The Meal:  The Tottie Rolls were OK.  Not the best I've ever had...but not bad.  The meal itself...I saw it and wondered...wasn't sure it was that much food.  Well...wow does that food pack down in that bowl.  I think I had somewhere between 3-5 servings out of that bowl.  It was an excellent meal.  The pork mixed with the rice noodles...and the sauce that came with it...along with some of the greens on the plate and the mint leaves...combined to make quite a tasty bite of food.  The bowl itself was never ending.  2 could've probably had enough food out of this (and at that point...I guess the price starts looking pretty good...but wasn't for a lone person trying to eat).  I really should've probably taken half of it home to at least get another meal out of it.  Don't know why I didn't in retrospect.  But it was good.  Very good.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying whatever happened to cooking Christmas dinner? I am Jewish, so for me Christmas= Chinese food, but apparently the secret is out. I went here tonight with the BF. We had made reservations for 7:30 and arrived at 7:20. The place was clearly understaffed as the two hostesses were running around like crazy acting as waitresses and bussers in addition to trying to host. As we stood there waiting for our table, about half of the tables in the restaurant left. You would think that this would make for a quick seating....surprise! It didn't. We waited for about 30 minutes to be seated. Additionally, several tables who did not have reservations were seated at the same time as us, which would have been fine if there were people working at this restaurant, but there weren't. So the BF and I sit there. The couple (without res) gets water, some small family that was seated at the same time gets water....we get nothing. The waitress comes around and takes their orders. Nothing. The family gets their appetizers and the waitress comes and takes their main entree order. Nothing. The other table gets their beers and sushi...still nothing! The hostess finally came by after at least twenty minutes and took our orders....we still do not have water. For real. And the place has gotten significantly less busy at this point. So we order the tangerine chicken and the pad kee mao with a 7/10 spiciness. We waited and waited. The other couple received entrees and just about finished them before we got our food. It was like we were in an episode of Seinfeld or something. The service was that bad.   We (finally) get our food and I will admit, the tangerine chicken was tasty. It was sweet and savory...pretty good. The problem is it was luke warm...like it had been sitting for awhile. Not cool. The pad kee mao was a disaster. First, it had about a 1-2 star spiciness level. Not spicy....at all. Second, in addition to not being spicy it was bland and kind of tasted like dishwater. Third, the veggies were still essentially raw. The dish was terrible. I have had much better (real) Thai food for a fraction of the price. We barely touched the dish, but no one showed us any concern or asked if our food was alright. The entire ordeal lasted one and half hours...for just entrees and water. Overall, the experience was terrible.   I know what you're thinking....But Jennifer, it's Christmas!... Yes, I know it's Christmas, but I don't care, it isn't an excuse. I made a reservation. If they they did not have the space, they should have A) not given us a reservation or B) not let in walk ins when they had reservations. Whoever owns this restaurant should have put more thought into staffing for a night that they KNEW would be busy because they took reservations! It was unacceptable. The place only got a second star because the tangerine chicken was good, but I would be hesitant to go here again because apparently my business means nothing to this restaurant.",

The food came relatively fast, but it was overall pretty flavorless (more on that below).  However, it took a while for the check to come. On the plus side, the atmosphere was nice and the place felt pretty clean.  The Food: I am a huge hot and sour soup fan and I was disappointed with the hot and sour soup - I can't quite put my finger on what was different with it, it just was lacking flavor/spice.  The pad thai had a similar issue and was a clump of gummy noodles - I have had better pad thai and I would not personally recommend the food, especially for the price.",

I spelled it Mogran for God's sake, like I am going to remember how to dine like a lady.    Anyway, I visited this fine establishment on a date and dropped a piece of raw fish on the table because chopsticks can be a little tricky. I looked at the raw morsel wondering if it was still safe to eat and wondering if they use an old rag to wipe down the tables or a clean bleach soaked one. In my hesitation, my date swooped it up and popped it in his mouth. Should I be weirded out by that? In the future, can I just use my fingers to avoid dropping sushi on the table?    P.S. The sushi was good enough to want to eat off the ground, let alone the table. Not sure if that makes a difference in your answer, just thought you should know.",

I ordered the the pad Thai at a medium heat. It came to me TOXIC. I'm accustomed to spicy food, this was inedible. I told the server it was to hot for me and she informed me that the medium there was jalapeno hot, it was way way beyond that. I eat spicy food regularly, this was toxic! She brought back my dish but this time there was ZERO heat. I can't believe there was nothing between 0 and 100! The server never even came back with forks after she took my plate away or asked if the new plate was any better. It was over all a disappointing experience.",

Rather, it means the restaurant offers cuisine from different Asian countries: Chinese stir-fry, Vietnamese pho and spring rolls, Japanese sushi, and perhaps the most prevalent, Thai noodle dishes, salads, and curries.  Like the menu, the restaurant is huge and beautifully decorated.  I got the Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) with chicken and medium spiciness.  An enormous dish for just above $10, and the noodles and chicken had a nice sweetness followed by a spicy kick.  Good balance of oil and sauce too.  Broccoli still had a bit of crunch left.  Solid 4-star dish.  The Thai fried rice was more of a combination - they threw in shrimp, chicken, and beef with the standard peas, carrots, and scallions.  My wife commented that it actually had a good amount of \"wok breath.\"  Also a $10 dish that can feed two.  Very surprised we were able to finish both dishes.  We were planning on a morning hike, so all those carbs came on handy.",

Of course, as soon as she returned home, and we opened the food container, there was the one ingredient present plain as the disappointed look on her face.  She said she emphasized this ingredient be excluded.  Because she is in food service herself and would not stand for this mistake, she was out the door faster than a cook not paying attention to a food order.  This now meant her meal would become cold!  Without compromise cleanliness and good service is to be expected when going to any food establishment.  The food may be good but not necessarily to one's taste.  But cleanliness and good service are controllable.  In my opinion that this order was not prepared properly is bad service.  It probably would have tasted fine with the excluded ingredient.  But consider people with life threatening food allergies.  Thankfully I am not one of those people, but the point is valid.  My request was simply a matter of preference.  This establishments cavalier attitude towards ingredient requests is unacceptable.  The remedy was to offer a free dish upon a next visit.  There will be no next visit.  Even if they had offered to pay for the mistake on the initial visit, which they should have (or discounted), there will be no next visit.",

I recently ordered the Panang Curry with Fried Soft Shell Crab and it was AMAZING - highly recommend!! I couldn't believe how flavorful the sauce was, and the crab was perfectly done. It was incredible.  I also really like the summer rolls with peanut sauce - they are really fresh and the sauce is to die.   Their chow fun, however, is not my favorite.

I ordered the shrimp and broccoli with beef added and the mango, sticky rice with coconut milk for dessert. I paid extra for the beef, but didn't think about it until I ate the leftovers at home. NO BEEF!! What? Shrimp and brocolli with beef added...without the beef?  The soup was gross (I can not think of a better adjective). Neither of us ate it. I told the waitress that we didn't want the soup and she nodded and walked away, leaving our full soups on the table for the entire meal. Was it her first day?   For some reason the waitress brought our dessert with our meal!!! I thought about asking her to take it away and bring it when we were finished our meal, but horrible visions of people spitting in my food popped into my head, further spoiling my appetite. So my mango with sticky rice sat there untouched for about 25 minutes, probably collecting dust particles, lint and spit. GROSS!  NOPE. I will NOT be back unless my meal is free.",

    "text": "Totties is a nice place to go if you aren't looking for authentic Asian food. The flavors are mild in the sense that they don't jump off the spoon into your tastebuds. I usually try each restaurant several times before I review a dish just to make sure they are consistent. I've ordered the Mongolian beef 4 times, each time ordering different levels of spice (on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the spiciest) the meat they use is of low quality and use way too many onions. I recommend ordering extra sauce so you can use all the rice they serve with it. I also suggest the Pupu platter as an appetizer for the table. It has a nice selection of food that is delicious and authentic.",

I only ordered water and few plates of sushi and rolls, but I enjoyed the experience fully. The ambiance is a 10/10, very beautiful interior with great design and architecture. Took a seat at the sushi bar and we were served promptly. The chef is Japanese (I think) and repeatedly insisted to us that \"anything is possible\". Liked that a lot.  My water was never below halfway--I love this in a restaurant. I prefer not even to be interrupted and asked if I need more water, just do it. Quality if the fish was fresh, too. Nothing smelled or tasted fishy, even the raw stuff. It was great to watch the chef's knife skills over casual conversation, but partway through our meal, he did get very upset and yell at a server which was pretttttttty awkward and not very professional.   All in all, I want to come back and try some of their entrees. I feel like I haven't had the full Tottie's experience yet since I only did sushi, so I'm excited for Round 2, whenever that may be.",

    "text": "I have been to Tottie's on Thomas Rd many times and each experience has been fantastic.  The food is tasty and bountiful, the servers are attentive and friendly, the atmosphere is intimate with far East decor and yet casual and comfortable.  They also have a small list of fruity cocktails, plus a few simple beers and wines.  I have never been to 2nd location on N Scottsdale Rd.  I love Thai food and have had it in many cities across America (have lived in NYC, Miami, Portland OR, Seattle, Chicago, to name a few cities).  There are maybe 3-4 Thai joints that I would give 5 stars, including this place.   This is the best Tom Yum Soup I have ever had.  It comes in one of those big aluminum bowls with the Sterno flame in the middle to keep it hot.  I think Tottie's offers heat at levels 1-4, and then also Thai Spicy (aka level 5).  My wife and I ordered it Thai Spicy.  It definitely packed some heat, but not so much that it burned the taste buds off your tongue so as to ruin the flavor of the dish. For me, it was the perfect level of spicy hot.  And more important, it was super tasty with all the characteristics you want in this spicy and sour soup.  Like all the best versions of Tom Yum, I pulled out fresh chunks of lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime leaves as I ate.  We had the Seafood option with scallops, white fish, mussels & shrimp (other choices are chicken or just shrimp).  It had a good amount of seafood, very hearty.  The amount was way too much for just my wife and I.  We both had 2 bowls each, and then took about half of the pot home.  I have had the Panang Curry multiple times here.  Panang is my personal favorite type of curry.  I always get the chicken option.  The full dinner order is a huge portion.  I am a very big eater, but ended up taking half of my plate home.  The Panang is also offered as a lunch special option (with about 20 other choices - very inexpensive lunch deals, before 3 PM only).  Lunch special is the same super delish food, but a smaller portion.  And by smaller, I mean I can finish it in one sitting and am quite full.  I expect a lot of people would have left overs ... like I said, I am a big eater.     Other stand outs include Tottie Rolls and/or Spring Rolls with peanut sauce for appetizers, Kang Keo Wan (green curry) with mussels, pan fried noodles, and their traditional Pad Thai.  All of these are wonderfully done.  Oh, and the fried rice is really really good, too -- fluffy and flavorful, not greasy.  I have never tried their Pho or Sushi so cannot comment. I will eventually venture to try more items, but so luv the Tom Yum and Panag that I find it hard to order other items.     FYI - sushi is not available until after 5 PM.  I know because I tried to order it for lunch.  When rejected, I got the Tom Yum soup ... again.   Enjoy!  :-)",

When I walked in I was greeted by a \"tired\" looking lady who was trying to be nice but you could tell it was not in her. I ordered the Beef Pho soup and what I got was far from Beef Pho. When it was a clear chicken broth looking soup that lacked many of the traditional flavor of a authentic Pho soup. It honestly tasted like Campbell's chicken soup. The beef was not sliced thin like a traditional Beef Pho instead it was hard and rubbery pieces of beef that had so much gristle inside it that I was unable to eat it. It was a major turn off. I had also ordered pork egg rolls and you guessed it...it had rubbery pork pieces inside it with mushy cabbage. I finally just put my fork down and kindly paid my bill and walked out. While I was there I couldn't help notice that they had a sushi station and that they also sold Thai food, Chinese food, Vietnamese food and Sushi. These are way too many items to have a one restaurant. The problem is that when places like this offer different items they tend to do them below average instead of concentrating of doing one type of food good and this is the case with this place. It tastes horrible, stay away.",

They have a wide array of Asian influences such as Thai, Chinese, Korean, etc.  The secret to their success is how they blend the sauces of different ethnic cuisines.  In addition, they have the ability to pair different Asian foods together in a menu.  They have straight up Thai choices, Chinese, sushi, and Vietnamese dishes as well.  I guess it really depends on what you are feeling.  The prices are very reasonable here for a fusion restaurant.  The place is a little small, but its cozy.  Just in case Totties 1 is full, you can always go to Totties 2 which is very close by!  The service is completed with such care as most Asian restaurants usually don't have.  Usually when you go to an Asian restaurant, you get good food and lousy service.  Here at Totties, you get amazing flavors and great service!",

    "text": "The restaurant is unassuming from the outside. It looks like just another hole in the wall restaurant in a strip mall.   On the inside, however, it is richly appointed with some of the nicest pieces of Asian art I've seen in a restaurant. I took a few pictures, but they don't do justice to how nice it is in this restaurant. It made for a much nicer and intimate evening with my beloved.  We decided to stick with the Chinese menu. We had the combo platter for the appetizer, the house pan fried noodles, the Mongolian beef, and the black bean chicken.   The appetizer had beef skewers that you cooked over a tiny fiery pot. The fire was a bit too lively, which caused a bit of concern. We liked the dishes, but would have liked a better mix of fried and non fried items. It felt like there were too many fried items.   The pan fried noodles were my favorite dish. They didn't skimp on the meat and shrimp. There was more than enough of the dish to have for leftovers. Sauce had a nice smokey flavor that I really enjoyed.  The black bean chicken wasn't my favorite. The portion was large, and the vegetable were varied, but it seems as though the cook just got a bit too heavy handed with the salt.   As for the Mongolian Beef, it was fine but not what I was looking for. That's not the fault of the restaurant. I loved this amazing hole in the wall Chinese restaurant called Ching Dau in that made the most delectable Mongolian beef. The recipe ran away along with the owners when the closed the restaurant down in the late nineties. This iteration was good with a tangy sauce and plenty of meat, but it's not close to the flavor I have been searching for.   The dish that made the visit worth everything was the fried bananas with homemade ice cream. The bananas had this deliciously crunchy shell, and the ice cream was subtly sweet. I believe it was vanilla, but the flavor was very light, so it was hard to tell.   We will be back to try other items on the menu.",

Spice and flavor: My husband likes things super spicey and I like a little spice. They have a 7 spicey system that actually works for any flavor level!  Plus, their egg rolls are vegetarian!

Which is a great variety, however, the Thai dishes we tried were not as good as other Thai restaurants we go to. We started with an appetizer of Tottie's Egg Rolls, they were delicious! They came with lettuce, mint, and cilantro, with an amazing dipping sauce. After the appetizer, we had high hopes for our entree's. The  entrees we ordered, were the Pad Thai and Panang curry. The Pad Thai noodles were so thin, (angel hair like) that they didn't hold up to the sauce and meat. Flavor and spice level was good, however. The Panang Curry was full of veggies, mushrooms, zucchini, peppers, bean sprouts and bamboo shoots, (not what I usually get in my Panang. The gravy was VERY \"peanut sauce tasting.\" Not a great balance of coconut milk and peanut flavors. (A bit too sweet too) I was missing the kaffir Lime, and Thai basil, to off set the sweetness. Anyway, we only tried the two dishes, and were left a bit disappointed. On the bright side, service was great, and the Tottie's Egg Rolls were scrumptious :-)",

    "text": "This place was pretty good. Nestled away in a Scottsdale shopping complex, you'll find a nice Asian fusion restaurant. The location is out of the way and not luxurious or private to pull up to and park. It's like a shopping complex.   It wasn't too busy when we went around 7pm for dinner. Our server was nice and she was just attentive enough for us to enjoy the meal among our group of friends.   We started with a Saki, of course, and it was pretty great. Price was decent, about 8 bucks, but on the higher end. For food I enjoyed a Pad Thai with chicken and (like a baby) NO spice! Haha I did get it on the side and added the chili flakes and oil on my own.   The Pad Thai was pretty good compared to the other places I've been. The portion size was big and it had a good portion of noodles to chicken to veggies. There was a really cool flaming appetizer someone had at another table which I wished we had tried but didn't get too.  I'd definitely come back and enjoy a meal here again with friends. The setting is casual, service is good and so is the food!   (Not, I forgot to take a pic BEFORE mixing my Pad Thai - so the original presentation was much better than the photo)",

    "text": "We kind of randomly picked Tottie's last night when we were in the mood for Asian food, because it's really close to my boyfriend's house. We almost went to SumoMaya or one of the other places we knew about, but I'm so glad we picked Tottie's instead. It is so delicious, and you get a ton of food for the price. We normally eat a lot, but we still have another meal's worth of food leftover (if not more!).   We got the Vegetable Fried Rice, Sesame Chicken and Soft Shell Crab with Curry. The plate of fried rice was humongous; we'll probably be able to have leftovers of this more than once. It was very well flavored and had a ton of veggies in it. The curry was also great, and it came in a huge bowl! The crabs were cooked very well. I'm not huge on that kind of seafood, but I still enjoyed it. The Sesame Chicken was my favorite - fried and crispy, and they had a perfect amount of sauce on it. A lot of places seem to leave their chicken too saucy or too bland, so that was great.   We'll definitely be going back here again, or will probably order it in the next time we want Asian food :) I would definitely recommend this place next time you're in the mood for Asian!!   I also got a really great fortune in my cookie lol ;) it was a nice ending to a good time out.",

    "text": "BACKGROUND   This is my second visit to Tottie's Asian Fusion and both times it was Mom's choice, including yesterday, for Mother's Day.  Although I stand by my original review, both visits were solid, fast, and very service oriented, without being obtrusive, so I thought I'd update my review.  TOTTIE'S ASIAN FUSION  Tottie's Asian Fusion is owned and operated by Ms. Tottie Kaya, who is also the chef.  Ms. Kaya learned from her mother's multi-cultural catering business in Laos as a child, and brought her knowledge and skills to Scottsdale.  Ms. Kaya's definition of \"Asian Fusion\" is bring together the best of Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Japanese cuisines, all under one roof, at affordable prices.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  I'm always sad about this restaurant being in this strip mall. I just feel that the outward appearance may be a turn off for the clientele the restaurant deserves.  Both visits were Mom's choice; she likes Tottie's.  The inside is all done up \"Asian\" style, with altars, dragons, faux flowers, etc; it's cute and cozy, but not fancy.  There is a sushi bar in the middle, but every time I've been, sushi was not available, and the sushi bar looks like it hasn't been used in a while.  We were seated at a booth, and Lexy was our server.   It was quite busy for Mother's Day, and they did a great job keeping up.  We tried the traditional spring rolls and chicken satay for appetizers. The spring rolls were good. The chicken satay was a bit chewy. Both were served with a delicious peanut sauce.  We had the chicken chow mien, red chicken curry, and shrimp with lobster sauce. All were served family style with HUGE portions.  My red chicken curry was very tasty, but I was disappointed there weren't any potatoes in the sauce.  Everything was quick and delicious. The staff was friendly, but not trying to be our friend; just perfect.   CONCLUSION  I've only tried the Indian River Plaza location, so far.  Although the strip shopping center is not my vibe, once inside, the atmosphere is very charming, and the generous portions of delicious food will win over even the harshest critics.  We will definitely keep coming back.  4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Two Scottsdale locations: Indian River Plaza, Lincoln Village Shops  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftottiesasianfusion.com&s=dfc17dc76766deb798d2370f480ae18274b353c04469ea8f44f469d0a0249682\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tottiesasianfusion.com</a>  ****************ORIGINAL REVIEW*************** **************************************************  Tottie's Asian Fusion was good food in a strip mall.   THE FACTS  I'm going to just boil it down:  * I quite like the \"Asian Fusion\" concept.  * I have no clue who owns this business. * I've heard there are other locations.  * It's in a so-so location. * It's in an unappealing strip mall. * The front of the restaurant is nice. * It's clean and cute. Nothing too special. * The staff is friendly. * They have a wide variety of food choices. * Not everything on the menu is available. Ask first. * There is a spicy choice from 1-7. 5 was very spicy. * The portions are huge. * The food is delicious.  * I had the edamame and pad thai with shrimp/chicken. * No prik nam pla. An excellent substitute upon request. * It was fairly fast. * Not everything comes out at once.  CONCLUSION  4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  * Plenty of Free Parking * Hours: Closed on Monday, 11am-9pm Daily",

    "text": "We tried this place on a whim - and liked it so much we came back about two weeks later. As suggested by the name, it is an Asian fusion restaurant, so they prepare Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai food. If you like these kinds of foods you are bound to find something you absolutely love here, and if you don't like Asian food... well, that's pretty unlikely.  On our first trip we tried the appetizer combo plate and pan-fried noodles, and on our second trip we had the pan fried noodles (again), fried rice, and sweet and sour soup. On my next trip I'll probably try the pad thai or the curry, both of which have great reviews. On both occasions the portions were huge with plenty left over for two people's lunch. If you're feeling like some sake, I tried a fruity kind and loved it but can't remember the name.  The service here is great. They greet you at the front door, are prompt with orders, and make sure everything is good and drinks are refilled. You couldn't really ask for much more in your dining experience. I definitely will be back.",

    "text": "Totties... I've read the 24 reviews that came before mine over and over, and I have to say, it was even better than expected!  Picture this: Sunday evening - dark and cold outside.  Hanging inside with fiance and future sister-in-law.  All of us feeling tired and hungry but too lazy to cook dinner.  Just watched Grey's Anatomy and Private Practice reruns and worked up appetite...  Thai food?  I suggested to them - oh yeah, we can't do that... none of the thai restaurants are open on Sundays.  Damn.  Vietnamese maybe?  Nope - the closest one I could think of was closed on Sundays also.  Chinese?  Too bad we don't have a great Chinese restaurant close by in the new 'hood anymore.  I know, let's try somewhere new... Totties!  I called to make sure they were open, and sure enough - not only were they open, but they are not even a mile away!  Perfect...  Tottie's was awesome - it was nicer inside than I imagined - for some reason I had in my head that it was going to be like Pei Wei - but it wasn't at all.  We were seated immediately and Kethy was our server (yes, Kethy - not Kathy).  She was cute and had personality - something you don't always find in restaurants now-a-day.  She honored our request to start with a big bowl of egg drop soup and add wontons to it!  With the soup on the way, we perused the menu... I love that Tottie's offers Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and sushi too!  We mixed it up a bit and ordered Pad Se Ew with Beef, Moo Shu Chicken, Thai Basil Stir Fry veggies, and steamed vegetable dumplings.  Medium spice and light on the oil.  It was way too much food, but it was fun to share a bunch of dishes, and now we have leftovers for dinner tonight!  **Pad Se Ew was the favorite dish of all but nothing we ordered was disappointing.  Total bill for all of the above was $43 before tip... not bad considering the amount of food we had!  Service was attentive - not only from Kethy, but Tottie (I think) came by, and our waters were fill constantly too.  I will totally return to Tottie's in the near future whether it be for Chinese, Thai, Sushi, or Vietnamese - or a combo... oh, and I'll have to remember to save room for the avocado ice cream next time!",

    "text": "So I'm not sure how this place gets a 4 star rating on Yelp but when you look at specific entrees at least for chinese entrees they're all \"not bad\" type of reviews.  But I had a pot sticker craving so I ordered a few items that seemed decent per reviews.  The guy said 15-20min but it took 40 minutes.  The pot stickers (which I got pan fried vs steamed) were actually more like deep fried.  The sauce is more sweet, not vinegary.  Not terrible but out of 6 there was about 2 that had a decent amount of filling, the rest had about a tablespoonful in a dumpling that is about 4 inches long and 3 inches tall.  The taste of the filling and the dumpling dough was good, just poor proportions and a bit greasy.  The sweet and sour chicken was bright pink and more onion than anything else.  Overall somehow the dish was bland.  The rice that came with it was soggy - too much water.   The pad see ew noodles were overcooked and clumped up into small cubed bits.  The flavor wasn't bad, but overcooked noodles really ruins a noodle dish.  Judging as these entrees that had decent ratings were not very good I don't think I'll be returning.",

    "text": "I was expecting so much from Tottie's.  The entire experience was very unwelcoming and just lack authentic flavor in the dish we ordered.  Known as a Asian Fusion, I thought  would be a fusion of flavors, however they have a Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese menu...not really a fusion.    The staff was somewhat obnoxious.  I overheard, one staff member tell our waitress, in a snobby tone, \"They just want water\" It was hot outside and yeah I would like some water to start off.  I would've gotten a drink but after hearing that, why bother. Staff members were later talking really loud about their lives and stories and was just really put off by it.   The menu was overwhelming.  There were special Tottie's dishes which didn't have a description of it was. I asked about the Dragonfly dish, and what type of noodles they were.  The waitress started giving us an education in noodles in a rude tone.  I was just taken back and annoyed that I really wanted to just walk out.  I just wanted to know what it was.    We ordered an order of Tottie's Rolls and Pad Thai.  The description of the egg roll, said it may be the best you ever had.  When the dish arrived to our table, the bottom of the egg rolls were soggy and the meat inside was soggy and really wet.  Therefore, I can only assume these were frozen and placed into a fryer that wasn't at the right temp.  They lack taste and still doesn't compare to my mother's Thai recipe.    The Pad Thai was really wet and really sweet and didn't taste like Pad Thai.  Probably the second worse pad Thai dish I've ever had, next to Pei Wei. All in all we've had better, service and food.  I would recommend going somewhere else.  For two individuals that are Asian and have friends/family that have restaurants, we were far from being impressed.",

    "text": "Totties was on a short list given to me by one of my college buddies of places to eat in town that fit my budget.  Back at UA we had a chinese restaurant right on the edge of campus for 3 of our 4 years. They had delicious chow-fun, thick noodles with great texture, a thick sauce that could be blended with curry powder upon request. Tons of noodles, with thin sliced steak in every bite that was so tender.  Tottie's Chow-fun was a bit of a letdown. The sauce was watery and lacking any deeper flavors. No notes of garlic, ginger, or deep soy flavor. It was almost broth like and picked up the favors from the overwhelming amount of sprouts. There was minimal beef as well, it tasted as if this has been stewed separately and didn't really flow with the dish. The noodles were also way too thin!   The sauce for the steamed dumplings was way off. The balance was cloyingly sweet and had little vinegar or citrus notes to balance it out. While the exterior was perfect, the pork filling was under seasoned and generally not enjoyable.  I know I'm being hard on this place. Perhaps its because I was out of sriracha sauce? Maybe, but this ran me nearly 20$. The hype is not real.",

If their food is going to have that type of effect on me, unfortunately it's not worth it. Luckily, their Thai iced tea doesn't hurt me one bit, and I'll occasionally run in and get one to go.",

I've eaten here twice:  once to go, and once dine-in - both for lunch.    I was very busy the first time so I took back some Kung Pao.  It was pretty good, but possibly the least spicy I've ever had.  The second time I went with 3 other coworkers that same week because I wanted to give some appetizers and other dishes a try.  We ordered the chicken lettuce wrap (aka \"Sugar Cane Chicken\") for appetizers, tried the hot & sour soup, and ordered the Beef Pad Kee Mow.    The chicken lettuce wraps were very good and also fun to make.  They bring in a miniature grill with flames and all, where you can warm your chicken, before putting it in the lettuce, mint, noodles, cucumber and cilantro.  Very tasty too!  The soup was nothing to write home about, but I didn't really expect it to be.   The Pad Kee Mow was actually very good.  I ordered it spicy, and again was surprised at how little spice was in it.  It was great but could have been more spicy.  They need to utilize a different rating system: Medium, Spicy, and Extra Spicy.  I go to Thai places in OC where the \"medium\" spice blows away Tottie's \"spicy.\"  This doesn't mean I didn't like it, it's just that I love the spice, baby.  I highly recommend going here for lunch.",

Panang Curry: Must have if you do curry.  The vegetables are cut with care, and done to perfection.  Bamboo shoots, squash, and all. Tofu is great.  Chicken is fantastic, too.  The beautifully grown basil garnish could be the best part, too.  I love basil, and if you do too - you're in luck.  Tonight my basil was purplish green with a dusting of silver.  Pad Kra Pao: Must have, too.  Stir fried chicken w/Thai basil in chili sauce, onions, red bell peppers & bamboo shoots.  Again, the vegetables were sliced and prepared with great care.  Excellent fragrance. Large portion.  Edamame. 3 bucks & change.  Always nice.  Do yourself a favor, too - and get the ice cream.  Tonight there were 10 custom flavors.  Peanut Butter, Lychee, Ginger, Apricot... can't remember them all. Our choice: Avocado.  Out of this world.  And the wafer? To die for.  As Roland W. recently wrote, I'm still somewhat up in the air, too, but tonite's performance may have convinced me that Tottie's is figuring out their new groove, and gettin' it.  I'll be back - for sure.  And every other time it's gonna be the Panang, too...  (Below is my earlier review posted from earlier this year: 2/08/2008)  Also going to mention that this place was formerly known as Shanghai Palace.  Same owners, new restaurant is twice the size.  So what is Tottie's take on Asian Fusion?  Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai.  Not really fusion, though... They just have a large menu that includes all four different cuisines.  While I've only visited once, and it was for lunch, I was disappointed to discover that the lunch specials are limited to Chinese dishes.  I went in hoping for Thai and had to settle for Kung Pao Chicken.  Additionally, there was only one vegetarian option on the lunch menu, and there are few veg options on the regular menu.  I will say that the lunch portion was well above-average in size, and it was good, however the hot and sour soup was a little iffy...  In conclusion, I'm looking forward to giving Tottie's another shot for some Thai food, but I won't be returning for the lunch special anytime soon... nice place, though!  And the owner is nice, friendly, and approachable!  Cheap for lunch, too!... if you like-a the meat.",

She helped me navigate the \"heat\" ratings so that I can get the flavor without the pain.   Can you find cheaper? Absolutely. And it will taste of it too.

Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai...  I have tried their sushi and I loved it.   But what I go for - what makes a bad day a good day - are their tottie rolls and their pho tai.  Their Tottie Rolls make Fate's Spring Rolls seem bland and amateurish. (yes, I said it.) The sauce is tangy, the ingredients are so fresh. You can smell the mint as soon as the waitress sets it down on the table.  ahhhhh.   Pho is an obsession of mine. And their are MANY places in the valley that serve. I enjoy totties' because the meat is so tender and the broth - so aromatic. The fact that it is walking distance from my house and it's a cheap $7 meal makes me very happy.   To-Go service never takes more than 10 minutes and the reception area ladies are always polite, courteous and fast. Plus, they never forget the hoisin - which is very important.    The service in general is extremely friendly and attentive. I ask for something - it appears in seconds. The fancy decor makes it safe to bring family (my mom is a new fan), colleagues, and dates.   Try their homemade ice cream. It will not disappoint.   Tottie herself is always doing the rounds. She seems to recognize all the regulars and makes you feel at home. We were there on what I think was her birthday once. She stopped by and gave us slices of her birthday cake. She is genuine and her menu is a testimony to her talent. Good for her!  And good for me - because I live next door to enjoy.   :)",

    "text": "We love this place!  This is definitely our favorite restaurant. We make the trek from Mesa almost every weekend, it's that good.  Even with the skyrocketing price of fuel we don't mind.  Tottie treats us like family now, so welcoming and accomodating.  Even when we show up not long before closing we are given the same excellent service and food.    The recent addition of the sushi bar has been great too, we never thought the place was lacking anything before they remodeled but they've gone from strength to strength.    We recently stopped eating meat, but that doesn't cause a problem here as they have so many different choices and will gladly accomodate any special dietary requirements.  Great lunch specials during the week as well, this place has it all.",

My favorite drink there is the Thai iced tea, but their regular iced tea is also extraordinary.  This is by far my favorite restaurant.  The owner is very warm and sincere.  She even comes by the tables when she isn't cooking to greet her customers.  The food sometimes is a bit pricey, but the food is worth it.  It is authentic food, not overly processed soggy asian food you get at some other places.  If you are wanting to go to have REAL food, with quality service and a nice atmosphere, go to Tottie's.  :)",

She holds her food up to the highest standard and will give you a hard time (personally) if you try to subvert that effort.  My favorite story is of when my roommate (GUILTY - we lived at San Tropez apartments and walked there three of the six days that place was open) went to get some soup \"to go\" and she made him sit there and enjoy her soup, refusing to put it in a styrofoam container to go. \"You eat here. Too much trouble. Soup TOO good TO GO. Tastes better sitting down...\" Tottie: You rock my socks! Since visiting Shanghai Palace, I've been comparing every Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant to it. And i fear I'll never stop.  Momentous taste-flavor sensations:  The Spring Rolls ...any of them Tom Ka Gai Mongolian Beef Curry Chicken Sweet & Sour Chicken",

Unlike other Asian restaurants that seems to have disappeared the next time we are back.   Although the sushi seems to be popular with their customers, we have stuck with the soup and noodles. Tried their wonton, hot and sour soup. Both are generous serving and very delicious. We went overboard in ordering the highest scale - No 7 - spicy for the Pad Thai which was too spicy. Next time will order No 3 or 4 spicy. Chicken cashews and shrimp fried rice were really delicious.  Will definitely visit it again the next time we are back and hopeful it will be there for many more years to come.",

    "text": "I have been here a couple times. The first time I went it was still under the Shanghai Palace name. I heard that Shanghai Palace was the only place in town that had soup dumplings. When I went I turned out the place changed hands to Tottie. Well I had already made my trip there from the air port. My friend who was with me who is also a chef decided to try out some of their dim sum and some apps. The dim sum items were over steamed and were dried out on top. Even the eggrolls were horrible. We noticed the sushi bar and the millions of items on the menu. I would never order something that not the specialty for the restaurant. I mean yeah asian fusion is good when done right but this place is far from that. It is just a bunch of different types of Asian food and non of it is fusion just traditional done wrong!  The second time I went I decided to give them a shot. I heard their Pho was good. Although I think Tottie is a Thai specialty. Well I have to say that not only was the service mediocre and we had to keep asking for water, I found a long, I mean real long, knotted hair in my pho. Of course I find it at the end of my meal and I nearly threw up on the table when I pulled out the hair from my mouth.   Not only is the food horrible, it's dirty and service sucks. I can handle bad food if the place was clean and they had good service. I don't think I ever saw any of the staff wash their hands after touching their hair, face or what not before serving food. Gross. You will never see me back here again. This might be a harsh review but I gave them 2 chances.",

The restaurant wasn't busy for lunchtime though. Ordered Pad Thai chicken lunch plate. The eggroll was barely warm but burned, saturated with oil, and had no flavor; it obviously had been precooked and sitting around waiting......for some time. The fried rice was horrendous. NO FLAVOR at all and mushy (was this Asian food really?).  The Pad Thai chicken had no flavor and the noodles for too thin and mushy.... OH and the soup! Had Hot and Sour soup - it was atrocious; Sweet and like jelly. Maybe that is the 'fusion' they are talking about?  I told the waiter when asked how it was \"okay\" as we had just started and he said, \"oh.\" My husband's food was equally horrific if not worse. We left most of the meal on the plate when we left and no one cared to ask. If you want bland fast food type American food then this is the place for you; but honestly, go elsewhere.",

My wife and I tried this spot for the first time based on a friends recommendation and the helpful reviewers found on Yelp. I had a hankerin for some Chinese food, and with all the great reviews, why not?  I'll tell you why not: the Chinese was pretty darn gross. I cannot comment on their Vietnamese, Thai, or Japanese selections, but based on what we had, I will NEVER eat Chinese here again.  Both the House Special Chow Mein and the Kung Pao Beef were odorless, flavorless, and unappatizing. Soy sauce was no match for the lack of deliciousness found in these items. Noodles, meat, veggies, everything was BLAND.  We were so hungry I found myself devouring the small container of white rice we received. And the Tottie Rolls??? Flavorless as well. What's goin on Yelpers???  I'm not gonna say Yelp has let me down, as most of the reviews here are for other items on the menu, but we will seriously reconsider this destination the next time we are in the mood for some Asian food, and if we do go here, it won't be for Chinese",

The original location is certainly not in the best spot, next to a planned parenthood, but once you are inside the asian decor makes you forget where you are.  The portions are absolutely huge.  One entree is more than enough for two people.    To start, my fiance and I had the Pho Tae Bo Vein.  This Pho hangs with the best.  A great selection of garnishments accompanies the soup.  Great taste and an entree in and of itself.  I will come back just for this dish.  We then ordered the Kang Keo Wan and the Chiang Mai Noodles.  These dishes taste essentially the same.  However, the Chiang Mai Noodles was had a little sweeter taste to it.  Overall, the spices were great, not to spicy but enough to have flavor.  Try this place out!",

It's a mile further from my house than Noodles Ranch (highly recommended) and is tucked in a sort of non-descript plaza that I never go to.  The first time I ate there I ordered the Szechwan Style Bean Curd, which was good, but did not get me overly excited.  It was served with the soft tofu, rather than the crispy style that I prefer.  I waited a couple of months before going back.  I then inquired about subbing tofu for meat in dishes.  They will sub tofu in for anything and make it crispy.  Awesome.  I have had the Tangerine Tofu and Sesame Tofu now, both of which were very tasty.  Totties will not be incorpated into my rotation of restaurants.  I look forward to working my way through the menu.    The interior of the place is very nicely done as well.  I never would have suspected that such a nice place lay inside from the look of the plaza interior.",

This place had a stagnant scent, a scent of someone wiping down the tables with a overly used wet towel and not using a freshly clean towel. When you wipe down tables with the same towel all day you're just dragging bacteria from table to table.  I figured it's on the \"best of\"list so I'll look past the aroma I mean it's on throw list for a reason. I asked the waiter what are you known for , it gives me a idea of what to order. He named practically every dish on the broad range of items menus so that was no help. So I ordered the Totties noodles. It was thin noodles with beef that had a peculiar taste to it, like they pre cooked it and reheated it as they added it to the stir fried veggies on top of the fried noodles. The brown  sauce was just salty ... no depth just salty. I ask ordered the tempura shrimp rice paper rolls . They were good. But in that case nature was providing the flavor so you really couldn't go wrong with that. I ordered the fried rice to go. It was average. I tend to give a restaurant a few chances (unless it's just obviously bad) so Next time I'll try the panang and the curries both red and green. If not pleased with those then I'll just think totties is just a \"Noty\"",

Usualyy it's one or the other and the pork was just odd...no other way to explain it. The pho is super bland! Make sure to ask for chili oil and paste to give it some flavor!  The other thing was atmosphere. The area I was seated in was quiet with some couples enjoying an eveing out and then they sat a group of 4 already drunk diners in our area chuging down sake and sake bombers. Why they would not have seated them on the other side of the restaurant is beyond me. Diners were just rushing to finish their dinner so they could escape!  The reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the service was good and the decor was nice.",

She was also helpful and when she didn't know the answer to a question we had she went and found out the answer very quickly and didn't try to just make up some nonsensical answer to appease us which I appreciated.  I had the Pad Kra Pao with beef with level 7 Thai hot which is the top level of crazy there (no biggie). The basil on top was all in a big bunch that I had to off the leaves myself which I didn't love having to do but I think was part of their presentation with a big cabbage leaf underneath as well so it was not a huge deal. I enjoyed my meal much and liked the heat. It was a good mix of veggies and I especially like the red peppers and bamboo shoots in there. The waitress didn't check on us till near the end of the meal and I generally like them to see how we like everything a few minutes after we get our food so that's where the service surfaced. She was willing to bring all the Tice we wanted to with our food free of charge and gave a bunch more extra rice in the boxed up food she gave to the people I came with who did not finish their meals.   Overall really good meal and I'll most likely be back sometime relatively soon.",

The Szechwan Style Bean Curd was flavorful and the portion was generous. Unfortunately the experience wasn't enough to make me wanna run back and eat here.

Rather than combine dishes of different ethnicities, it's just a restaurant that has several different ethnic foods (mainly Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese).  I got the lunch order of beef and broccoli, which came with soup (choice of hot and sour or egg drop), and rice (white or fried), and an egg roll.  I chose the hot and sour soup and white rice.  The beef and broccoli was just okay, but it was definitely much more broccoli than beef.  The broccoli was less than crisp and the beef was a tad bland (although there was a bunch of garlic on it).  The hot and sour soup was thick (almost syrup thick) and decent.  The egg roll wasn't very good and the rice was rice.  It was a fairly decent amount of food for less than $9.  Service was fast and friendly.  I'm not sure how good I can expect Asian food to be in Arizona, so I'm giving this place a higher rating than it probably deserves.  Given all the other good restaurants I've been to over the last week, I probably wouldn't come back here again.",

I never had any issues with the service and they do refill your waters frequently.  Chicken Chow Mein = So far my favorite of the lunch specials, although it's quite basic in nature. I did like the sauce they used for the noodles as it flows well with the fried rice. Pad Thai = It's been a while since I had it but I remember it being good. Sliced Chicken With Garlic Sauce = Would probably pass on it next time, not the best choice in my opinion.  I would recommend the fried rice with the lunch specials as it's quite good.

When he was leaving they told him they'd been voted Best in the Valley for Chinese food 3 years in a row, which after trying it I can say is a blatant lie.  We got Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken and Beef Chow Mein. The Mongolian Beef was the best of the 3, but was still MEH, at best. The Sesame Chicken was dry and the sauce was not like any sesame chicken sauce I've ever had, and not in a good way. Also, it came on a bed of shredded lettuce, which was very offputting for me. The Chow Mein was not even chow mein by any definition! On top of that the beef in it was extremely dry and flavorless.    We LOVE Chinese leftovers, but this was so crummy we threw the leftovers away.",

Almost tasteless.  The peanut sauce tasted like a watered down peanut butter reduction, with no complexity.  I love the Thai dish, Pad See Ew.  Tottie's version is a gummy, brown, underspiced version, with nothing to recommend it.  My wife ordered the Sesame Chicken, which should have been easy enough to do.  What she was served was overcooked chicken in an overly sweet sauce.  The Tsingtao & Singha beers were cold, and fortunately, Tottie's had nothing to do with their manufacture.  Service was disjointed, albeit pleasant.  We will never be back.",

    "text": "A Good Asian Fall Back  I've had inconsistent experiences with Totties over the years, so this is not generally my \"go to\" destination to dine.  I have discovered, as have some of my friends, that this is a better dine-in destination than a take-out choice. The items I've ordered and consumed in-store have been of higher quality than those taken out. To give Tottie's credit, It may just be that the items I've ordered for take-out are not well suited for that.   I addition, when I dine there with small groups of friends, I have never had the experience of everyone at the table being pleased with their food. Each time at least one person has had a food preparation issue.  Service is variable, largely depending on how busy they are. In generally, staff is polite and attentive. If you are seated in a section with no one else about, it can be difficult to get anyone's attention. I'm ok with getting up and finding someone though.  The menu is extensive and varied to suit different tastes. Preparation, however, became inconsistent when Totties #2 opened awhile back. I no longer order the soft shell crab because even when I've requested to be sure it isn't overcooked, it has been overcooked more often than not. The Egg Foo Yong was an initial favorite of mine, but it sometimes arrives literally soaked with oil.   I enjoy their Hot & Sour Soup and Tom Yum, but didn't care much for the Pho. I enjoy their Fresh Spring Rolls and Shoji Noodles. The beef in the Shoji Noodles was delicious and there were generous portions of both the beef and the broccoli.   I have had challenges with the spice (heat) levels not matching my request. This is fine when it comes out too mild since I can enhance it, but if it arrives too spicy that's another story.   Originally, I ordered Sushi as often as not, but the Sushi Menu isn't available until after 5:00. I very often am ready to eat earlier than that, or am looking for lunch.  This is not a bad place, it just seldom completely hits the mark for me and I generally consider other options first. I have also dined at Tottie's 2 with friends, and we had a better experience there.",

    "text": "Tottie's is a family owned restaurant where customer service prevails. The food is mouth watering to look at and painfully delicious to eat.   Painful? WHA- The problem is how much you'll want to eat.  My friend and I stopped in for a late afternoon bite. We had just missed the lunch specials (but that's ok! more to take home) and settled into our luxurious booth. The restaurant offers a variety of seating, ranging from tables to booths to the bar. All look equally appealing. (And can readily accommodate groups.)  Michael charmed us with the joy and eagerness he exuded. After ordering Pad Thai and Panang Curry he generously offered us soup leftover from lunch. (And our rubber arms quickly said yes!)   SOUP Why does this have it's own category? The egg drop soup and sweet and sour are *only* served during lunch hours. (11am - 2pm). If you're lucky some might be leftover and Michael might be around to share. You should try those two soups. And here's a trick. Try those two soups mixed together.  Hoy My Goodness. The sweet and sour is a powerfully strong soup offering a kick of spice. The egg drop soup is rich (and has mushrooms, which work quite well) and creamy in a different way. Together? You've got to try it. I highly recommend it.   HAPPY HOUR Runs Tuesday thru Friday, 5pm - 7pm. Food and drink specials abound. Sushi rolls are discounted and they offer things like Sake Bombers, Mimosas, a Riesling and a red blend for $5. (Some other wines for $4. Budlight for $2.50.)   FOOD The Pad Thai delivers on all levels. If you really want it fire engine hot they will provide additional spices. The Panang Curry kicks butt. Spicy means enough to clear your sinuses but not make you cry. The dinner portions are ginormous. You could readily share a meal...but then there'd be no leftovers!  I'd definitely throw in a Thai Tea if you've never had one. It's almost smoky in taste (yet sweet) and goes down too quickly.  SERVICE I don't know how he did it, Michael must have eyes in the back of his head or something, but my Diet Pepsi was never empty. I slurped down three that I can remember. And he even offered to provide one to go!  This place rocks!  p.s. there's another location in northern scottsdale.",

The portions were huge! We all were impressed with the food and had no complaints. The food was clearly fresh (something you don't always get at asian restaurants) and while we ordered it for takeout, attention had been paid to presentation.  Three of us wanted to pay separately and this was easily accommodated. One huge plus: they made sure to double bag the entrees and soup to ensure that they didn't spill/leak while in transit - definitely appreciate this level of attention to detail. They didn't provide utensils or soy sauce, but provided all other condiments and sauces the entrees required. My co-worker picked up the order and commented that the decor in the restaurant was unique. He said the staff was friendly and efficient.  We were all pleased and will definitely return/order take out again in the future.",

Restaurants should be a respite from the heat but I was smoldering and not in a good way. I was willing to overlook it long enough to eat but when my glasses are sliding down my face from sweat, I'm not a happy camper. Turn it down a few degrees and it's a 5.",

The food is fresh and flavorful and the atmosphere is classy and inviting. The owner, Tottie is amazing as well, she makes incredible food and treats her guests like family. This food is the best Asian food I've ever had.  Treat yourself to the Fried Banana and Coconut Ice Cream after your meal, you'll be glad you did.   5stars!!",

    "text": "\"I can't believe I drove so far for this place\" comes to mind when I recall my experience here. Excuse me to my pals who think this place is all that. I guess we all can't have the same opinions; we'd just be robots. Maybe  they had a bad day, as in a really bad day - with the word really underlined, twice. Problems with the kitchen, problems with the service, problems with the fact they're even open. The high point of this experience was waiting for my friend to show up, I stopped at the second hand store next door and didn't buy anything.  At this point, I don't care to remember what I ordered, I just remember trying to order it a 6 of 7 and the waitress scoffed at me and asked if I was sure I wanted it that spicy. \"You can always make it hotter, but can't make it less spicy.\" I guess that was True because I gave in and ordered it a 5. What I didn't realize was that the waitress meant to say I ordered a 5 on a scale of 1-100, cause this didn't have any spice at all. bleh...  After a few bites I calmly explained that on a scale of 1 to 7 that my dish was more like a 0, no spice at all. Her response, if you really must know, she said, sorry, we just had a \"big order from a table of 6 people\" if you want the kitchen to re-make your order, it will be about 30 minutes. Instead of waiting for 30 minutes, I asked if she could bring me some thai chili peppers and some chili paste to add to my dish, I'd just take care of it myself instead; she showed up with chili oil and soy sauce. :-/ Thanks, I guess. I pushed through, spiced up my dish to satisfaction and 'enjoyed' the rest of my meal, but mostly the conversation with my friend and not really the meal or the dining experience.   My friends dish was pretty sub satisfactory to her, and she asked the waitress to just take it back. The waitress didn't seem to want to just take the dish from the table and leave it at that, after insisting on making a new dish to replace the unsatisfactory dish about five times. Instead of just returning the dish, she gave in to the waitress and selected something different. While her replacement dish was better, but not awesome, she ended up getting charged for the replacement dish she didn't really want to begin with.  Given the choice, next time I'll aim for taco bell. Not exactly apples to apples in comparison, but at least I wont have to spend a lot for crummy service and mediocre food.  Happy Yelping Phoenix.",

    "text": "Totties asian fusion restaurant is an all in one fusion place to go for your Asian needs! Viet, Thai and traditional Chinese dishes and even some sushi in there! The plates are very huge so you actually pay for what you get, like a plate of 11 dollar pad Thai or fried rice can feed up to 3 or 2 people, or just yourself if you are greedy like that! But let's get to the point they do have craft beer and of course Asian beers and sake bombers to go with your meal! Place is well dim, so more moody for like dinner or intimate conversations! I always get the pad Thai and I also recommend the Thai basil fried rice. Prices are moderate, but the food always makes up for it, expect to be leaving here with a full stomach and smile! Service is always delightful! Definitely one of my favorite places to visit and eat and take some friends out!",

    "text": "Recently had dinner on a quiet Sunday evening.  All 4 of us ordered from different areas of the menu - Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese.  A great place to try variety.  Ordered fried wontons for the table - plenty to share and nicely meaty.  Good reviews overall from the entrees.  Bun Tom, kind of a noodle salad with shrimp, bits of chicken & pork and Tottie (spring) rolls w/ sauce tasted fresh and light, was so looking forward to leftovers for next day lunch.  Sweet & sour pork got good reviews but somewhat skimpy on the pork.  Sizzling noodles was reported delightful as was the Pho.  Overall the food was excellent.  Service was a tad annoying.  The waitress was reasonably attentive but somewhat pushy.  She rushed our meals, delivered entrees too soon and shoved barely touched appetizer aside to make room on the table.  Even suggested we stop talking and start eating...what??    The place was somewhat empty, so there was no need to rush service.  We picked Tottie's for a quiet and relaxing meal to be enjoyed with friends.  I wished we'd followed our initial idea to order appetizer first and later place dinner order.  We had leftovers so she boxed up and made a big deal out of telling me she would bring fresh sauce for me.  When I dug into my leftovers the next day, I found she had completely omitted sauce.  Okay, I'm ranting.  I still enjoyed my leftovers and wished for the sauce that would have completed the meal.",

    "text": "Every single thing, down to the smallest detail was so wonderful at Totties that I could give nothing less than 5 stars. I was in the area with a friend to see a band play and remembered someone mentioning they liked Totties. After the show, we hopped in to see what it was all about. The restaurant smelled intoxicating. If that wasn't enough the decor wooed me in the rest of the way. We were seated promptly and given menus to review.   One of my favorite things off the bat was that our waitress Naomi didn't ask us what we wanted to drink, she asked if we wanted anything aside from water. I liked knowing that either way, I was getting something while I made a decision on dinner.   And, well, that was a pretty hard decision. The menu has countless items I am still craving now after reading them hours before. I ended up having the red salmon curry, which was accompanied by sticky rice and steamed zucchini, broccoli, sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. It was so phenomenal that half of me was sad I was unable to finish it all but the other half was excited my taste buds would get to experience it for lunch tomorrow.   The service was truly top notch and everything was prompt and genuine. From our server to the owner, I can do nothing but compliment them repeatedly. That alone makes me anxious to return. You don't see this level of service much these days.  If you want a nice, quiet, gorgeous, friendly, and inexpensive place to eat, you will definitely find a home at Totties.  PS.. At some point, walk past the bar and check out the sweet as optical illusion mirror!!",

But after a long day we were tired and hungry and it's just around the corner from my house.  Now, I've been around the Asian food block a few times and what we brought home was undefinable. We ordered Singapore noodles and orange chicken and egg rolls, which came out to be well over 30 dollars.  I have to say for what they were charging and how long we waited, they must have mixed up our order or been playing a prank. I mean $8 dollars for pretty okay egg rolls? I don't care if you call them a \"chef special\" its not worth 8 bucks unless I pass out from deliciousness. And a 20 minute wait at the end of the night when no one is in the building. Perhaps everyone had gone home. Maybe the dish washers even made our food? That would explain why everything was the same color and why we walked out with a box of mint and lettuce. (that's abnormal right?)  Sadly, as much as I wanted a neighborhood place to grab a yummy bite, I won't be back to this one.",

After watching the full episode it got me craving the classic dish. I fought off the temptation for two hours (I mean pool season is rapidly approaching ) but finally gave in. So I turned over to my trusty Yelp app and Tottie's came up as the overall favorite, I can now see why.  So I went for pick up and was greeted straight away. They took my Chicken Pad Thai order (no egg...I know a staple to the dish but I can't stand them) and had it ready within 10 minutes. I went 20 mph over the speed limit the whole way home because the smell was killing me. Finally I dug in and it was everything i was looking for. I went with medium spicy and it was perfect. Just enough spice compared to sweet. A large portion size for the price and the noodles were perfectly cooked. Sorry Pei Wei you just lost a Pad Thai customer.",

Why would this be such a curse you might ask?  Because it means that on any given Saturday, there is a very decent chance their hostess will be asked to sit anywhere from 2-11 people after a festive day filled with swimming, margaritas, and sand volleyball who may or may not be still wearing board shorts and bikinis with T-shirts thrown on.  All of that aside, Tottie's is a fantastic place no matter what condition you are in.  All of the servers are amazing and attentive, making sure that your every need is attended to.    The atmosphere is a great balance between a formal and casual dining experience.  There is a bar area that, as Coda B mentioned has several LCD TV's playing whatever the main sporting event is at the time (March Madness right now!).  The atmosphere is darker, and although seems quieter at first, there are pockets of excitement that pop up.  Down to the food.  Tottie's has, hands down, the best Panang I've had in recent memory and I'm a huge curry fan.  The curry sauce is out of this world, causing me to want to get down on my knees and thank my Thai Queen Tottie herself.  The portions are huge for the price, and the Pad Thai and Pad Kra Pao are also excellent.  There aren't a lot of choices for Thai food near Tottie's, but luckily there don't have to be.  Tottie's is the place to be!",

    "text": "Following fast on the footsteps of my recent excursion to Totties Asian Fusion II with Alex C -- I took my new boy-toy to the orig, as we were craving both sushi AND thom khak kai soup.  Smart choice.  This location was equally chock full of deliciousness although we went a bit of a different route for dinner than my 1st experience at Totties 2.  Steve was in the mood for sushi and loves the stuff. I like certain kinds and was still hardcore craving the thom khak kai soup from last time. Great compromise and everything pan-Asian under one roof makes it very convenient and easy to love this Tottie's location.   We started off with my fave Thai soup and a delicious plate of spicy cucumber.  Steve said he's not really even a fan of cucumber but we mawed this stuff down.  The soup was amazing and we both agreed that we could bathe in this stuff!  That's how good it is!  Then the sushi started coming out. I don't even remember what all we ordered but I think the two of us packed away 4 kinds of rolls and Steve had some sashimi.  The sushi was fantastic and the staff was hell-bent on keeping our Pepsi's & waters re-filled and checked in regularly to make sure everything was going well. It was.  So I've now had 2 amazing experiences at 2 separate Tottie's locations and God forbid Tottie should ever decide to change professions, but if she were to do so, I pray she starts teaching classes at a restaurant school (or consults), because she most definitely understands & executes flawlessly on the concepts of service, cleanliness, fresh food and tasty experimentation.  She could help a lot of places with great food but shitty service.  Both Tottie's locations now get my 5 stars and I'll be back again & again to immerse myself in the complete Zen that is Tottie's Asian Fusion.",

When I went in to pick it up the girls at the front were super nice, and had the soup ready to go. It was a huge plastic container of soup for less than $6! Great deal.   When I got home I thought the soup would be all over since it tipped over on the ride home. It wasn't. They put it in a good plastic container, and double bagged it, not a drop was spilled.  OK, on to the soup...it was wonderful! I got the Chicken Corn Soup, which basically was egg drop soup with chicken and corn.

She brought our check with 2 fortune cookies on top, came back 2 minutes later, then tossed the cookies onto the table and wiggled the check at us.  I was willing to write off this occasion since my first was so good.  I went back for a 3rd try and actually had to walk out because the service was so bad.    Our group of 4 came in and said that we needed a table for 4.  The hostess showed us to a table with only 3 seats at it, then looked confused when we pointed out that we needed another chair.  She then showed us to another table with 3 seats, then started to walk away.  When we got her attention to point out that 3 seats are never adequate for 4 people regardless which side of the room it is on, she told us to go \"wait in line\" again.    Technically there was no line, but we went back up to the front to wait for a 4th chair at either table.  While we were waiting for them to get their sh!t together, I noticed that the hostess was grabbing chairs from all over the restaurant and putting it at a table that did not have all of their dining partners.  I'm no restaurant owner, but it seems to me that it would be more important to seat people WHO ARE ACTUALLY THERE!  My blood was starting to boil, but we were seated and I was willing to forgive.  We had our menus and we were ready to order, but we waited and waited.  I think it was 15 minutes before the waitress (the weird clingy one from my second trip) came to our table, we had no drinks, no nothing.  We realized how much time we were wasting and discussed getting our food to go before the waitress finally appeared at our table.  When we mentioned getting our food to go, she gave us THE NASTIEST LOOK then told us that we would have to go tell the hostess what we wanted.  I lost it.  I told the waitress that everything that we had experienced thus far was completely unacceptable and I wouldn't tolerate it.  I stood up to leave and she stood where she was (in my way), ignored me, and tried to take my dining companion's orders.  She finally backed off without even a glimmer of apology after my companion's realized that I really was leaving.   I will not go back here ever again, no food is worth this treatment.",

    "text": "We ended up here on accident today, and decided to give it a try. There were things we loved and things that were just OK, and things that disappointed.  We shared a gigantic bowl of egg drop soup, which normally has chicken in it, so we made it vegetarian. It was pretty good- a tad bland, maybe. I liked it better with a splash of soy sauce.  The iced tea was funky, I asked specifically if it was plain black tea, and the waitress said, yes, it was Lipton's. Not so. It had some \"secret ingredient\" in it that made it cloudy. I think it might have been coconut milk. I just didn't care for it and wished she had been completely honest from the get go.  Our entrees were OK- Hubby had a tofu Shanghai noodle dish that was fine, but again, kind of bland. My House Chow Fun with chicken, beef, and shrimp, was unlike any chow fun I have had before. Obviously some different spices were used, and it was alright, but I prefer others I have had.   The dessert was the standout. Honey fried bananas with peanut butter and coconut ice creams. Seriously sweet and lightly battered crispy bananas with a scoop of intense peanut butter and then one of a mild and yummy coconut ice cream.   We may return, as they seem to be very flexible on ingredients and preparation. Just about anything can be made vegetarian- just say \"no meat, add tofu\" said the waitress. Any other ingredient can be left out as well, due to allergies or taste preferences.",

I found out that the glass dragon everyone talks about consists of hundreds of individual pieces that all had to be hanged individually and took weeks to put together.  A little known secret: Try the avocado ice cream. Yes I know it sounds gross, dont be a wuss and just try it, its very good. I even bought a quart to take home.",

They have sushi, Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese dishes all in the same restaurant. Could be great for groups with difference tastes. You could also go family style and get a blend of different flavors to satisfy all your cravings at once.  The food itself is extremely good. I wasn't dissapointed in any of the dishes they brought us. We tried a Thai dish, the house rolls for an appetizer and a Chinese shrimp dish. All of it was fantastic and we left stuffed for sure.  The service was equally great. And the atmosphere is picture perfect. Definitely recommended!",

Both excellent. Even though the server was basically running the floor by himself, he did a great job. Only complaint about their service is once went in kinda near to closing time and host (obviously wanting to close & go home- btw I've been there sister I'm a server) took one look at us, turned on her heel and walked away when a simple, polite \"the kitchen is closing\" would have sufficed. Everything else I've tried food-wise has been great. Sushi seems a little on the spendy side- so haven't ventured there. Overall, love this place. Huge menu, great food.",

My steamed pork egg roll was dry and more stuffed with lettuce than anything, the peanut sauce didn't even soften it up. The sushi was mediocre and honestly forgettable. The 2nd star is for ambience, since it was pretty strategically lit and set up. I dunno, I wasn't really impressed and probably won't return again, but then again maybe Tottie's isn't my cup of tea.",

    "text": "A co-worker of mine kept talking about Tottie's, so last night I finally gave it a try.  I don't know if it is different dining in, because I ordered take-out, but it was good.  It didn't blow me away, but it was good.  Very similar to good chinese take-out, or maybe a notch up.  I ordered the Tottie Rolls as a starter.  They are crispy egg rolls that you wrap in a lettuce leaf, with mint and parsley.  They come with a sort-of sweet and sour sauce for dipping that was quite nice.  Or atleast I think that is how you are supposed to eat them?  I had a big take out container full of lettuce, mint and parsley, so I figured that was the drill since I didn't order a salad?  They were good.  I ordered the Tangerine Chicken and the Beef Pad Lard Na.  The chicken dish was good, tasted like an orange chicken, deep fried until crispy then tossed in a sweet tangerine sauce.  It had a few strips of red bell pepper also.  The beef dish I liked a little more, it was the wide egg noodles and had chunks of beef, onion, pea pods and bok choy in a really good brown sauce.  You can order many of the dishes mild to HOT, so I did a medium hot since I sharing the dishes I didn't want to blow them out of the water with too spicy of a dish.  Next time I will definitely go hotter!  The dishes came with 2 containers of sticky white rice, which was exactly what it sounds like. I didn't have any dessert, but the crispy bananas sound great, and I am interested in trying the ice creams I keep hearing about.  I also really want to try the soups, they sound good.    All in all, it was good (I keep saying good!)  the prices are reasonable, and the portions are big.  I have enough for lunch leftovers today.  So, it is worth giving them a try, and I will be back.",

So seven of us headed over there to give it a try.  The service was pretty slow first off which was kind of annoying.  We came after the lunch rush at 1pm and our server took quite awhile to come to our table and take a drink orders... then waited some more for her to come back and take our lunch orders.  I got the Kung Pao Beef, it came with choice of soup (egg drop or hot and sour), egg roll, and steamed or fried rice.  It was a lot of food and it was good, but I was not blown away like i was expecting.  It was also pretty cheap... all the above mentioned food was $6.25 + $2.00 for a drink.  Others at the table seemed to enjoy their food too, except for one, but again no one was raving about their food.  I would definitely come back because the price is right and I was not disappointed.  Maybe my expectations were to high.",

Chef and owner Tottie Kaya, along with her husband have been tirelessly working on the expansion for months unbeknownst to the ordinary diner.  In 2008, the wall that separated the old part of the restaurant from the brand new portion was knocked down.  This has made Shanghai Palace, now known as \"Tottie's Asian Fusian\", more than twice it's size.  The renovations include warm orange and red colored walls along with specially designed furniture and a gorgeous suspended crystal sculpture.  The cuisine has expanded as well.  A brand new Sushi Bar featuring authentic Japanese creations by a separate Japanese chef is soon on it's way.  The beer and wine selections will also make way for a full bar as soon as Tottie's liquor liscense arrives.  If you like things on the spicy side, make sure to ask for Totti'e special hot sauce made from lime and chili's she grows herself!  The prices are just right the food is prepared fresh and of utmost quality and the Chef is ready to greet our guests with excellent service.  Please consider Tottie's Asian Fusian for families and anyone else seeking great asian cuisine without the hype!",

The deco and atmosphere is nice but food is terrible. I ordered their special dish Siu Mai, after talking to the lady who seems to be the owner. I wanted to make sure they are not just frozen and made on their premises. She assured me they were good. But what a disappointment. Their so called Siu Mai was just ground chicken mixed with shredded carrots with 1 shrimp wrapped with won ton skin. It was plain, rough and tasteless. I prefer eating a slice of white bread than paying $5 for 4 little Siu Mai's. My wife order their Kung Pao Beef lunch special. Their sweet and sour soup was dark, watery and tasted awful. Kung Pao Beef had too much dark sauce and the portion was small for $7.50. My wife said only fried rice was OK. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

A family business that cares about it's customers, you can tell immediately upon entering that this place is something different. Tottie is well-known for her ability to please her customers with her knowledge of Asian dishes and offers a variety on the menu that most places don't have. Try the Thai dishes if you have any doubt. Her curry dishes have become something that most Thai restaurants couldn't come close to. Fantastic! The friendly service and wait staff are always pleasant and fun and Tottie herself will come to your table to chat you up and make sure you are happy. A beautiful, relaxing atmosphere, great food, a sushi bar with a top notch chef making it fresh for you, reasonable prices, and Tottie on top of everything make for a great place to visit.
