    "text": "We were out shopping in the area and turned to yelp for great reviews on sandwich shops close by.  AZ Bread Co. came up and we decided to give it a try for take out.  We ordered the El Pavo: turkey breast, bacon, avocado, tomato, lettuce, and it was supposed to come with pepper jack, but it was missing.  This sandwich was very dry and tasteless.  It had no mayo or other condiment added.  It did come with a small side of coleslaw that was also bland.  Our second sandwich was the Carne Adovada.  This was also very bland.  I definitely didn't taste any chipotle mayo!  We chose the red potato salad which was also flavorless.  While the customer service was very friendly and our order was ready to go quickly, we were extremely disappointed with the taste of our lunch, especially for the steep price tag!  We will not return for lunch and do not recommend.  I did notice when I went back and actually read the reviews, that most were for breakfast.  Maybe that's how they received so many stars.",

The servers get the tables cleaned very quickly so there wasn't much of a wait for an open table.    For the second time, I got the egg sandwich on ciabatta and it was fantastic.  I'm not used to ciabatta being so soft and chewey - normally it's toasted until it's rock hard.  This is soft enough for my 18 month old daughter to eat (and she calls it \"balabala\".)  My husband got the carne adovada again and it was amazing.  Spicier this time than the last.  It's served with toast... some of the best wheat bread I've tasted.  My mother ordered one of the wraps and was very pleased with it.    My only gripe is their coffee is weak.  But then again, I like a strong cup of coffee and it's extremely rare that I order coffee outside of my home - nobody makes it right - you eather have it too weak or it's burned to a crisp (ala Charbucks).    This place is close to home so we will return.  P.S. - there's interesting local art on the walls.  I've been meaning to ask if any of it is for sale.  I love supporting local small businesses and artists.",

I wanted soup because, honestly, my office is so stinking cold I needed to warm up. I was torn between two soups: the tortilla and the chicken chili. The woman at the counter was very nice and gave me a taste of both. They were both fairly bland and average. I decided on the chicken chili and ordered it in a bread boule.   The soup was just so bland. It was salt, some corn starch to make it have that weird gelatinous texture thing going on and it was lacking in substance. Some little shredded pieces of chicken and that's about it. I wanted some green chilis!! Or anything really to add some flavor. The bread was ok. Not great, not terrible.   Overall, I was fairly disappointed but I would be willing to give it another shot and try something different on the menu. The menu is pretty varied, which was a good thing.",

Instead, I went with the turkey avocado BLT wrap. I had high hopes, but was sorely disappointed. It was super bland and boring, and I think that's tough to accomplish with a BLT. There was way too much turkey, so it totally overpowered the rest of the ingredients, and the avocado didn't seem very fresh. The only redeeming part of the meal was the red potato salad which was actually pretty good.   I probably wouldn't come here again. The menu overall seems pretty unoriginal, and the ingredients just weren't very impressive.",

Stopped here for breakfast with my girlfriend and although it took a little while to get our food (20 min. but the place was PACKED because of a local cycling event and Pat's Run) it was well worth the wait!  I got the Carne Adovado and it was delicious! The pork was seasoned perfectly, VERY tender, and the jalapeno cheese on top kicked up the heat just right for the dish! My girlfriends sandwich was pretty good too but she stole a few bites of pork too because it was so good!  The potatoes were also great, and seasoned very well. The only thing that was slightly disappointing was the eggs. Not very fluffy and no flavor to them hardly at all. Perfect for pairing together with bites of the rest of the plate though I guess.  Portion size was great too, we both left completely stuffed! Definitely give these guys a try!",

She got involved in a long order with many questions, the man at the counter finished helping his customer, glanced over and walked away without saying a word. We had never been there before, so he couldn't have had a bad experience with us, but that's how he acted. Maybe we resembled someone he hated. He wandered aimlessly around the restaurant while we waited. Ordered the Wrangler, the eggs and potatoes were standard quality, the pure pork sausage seemed good when hot, but as it cooled down seemed to be full of soy filler or something. The sourdough toast was good, although I suspect they use margarine, not butter on it.  There were tables outside, as we left someone was smoking there. First and last visit.",

It's set up so that you walk in, place your order, receive a number and seat yourself at a table. The decor is bright and cheerful, and the facility can accommodate large groups.   I had a frittata with spinach, mushroom, red pepper, onion and feta. I couldn't even tell that I had ordered it with Egg Beaters!  I really appreciated being asked if I wanted butter on my toast; rarely do breakfast joints even provide that option.  I chose the honey whole wheat bread and the portion size was incredibly generous. My frittata was accompanied by diced potatoes, which were in need of a little salt and pepper (I'd rather have to salt my food than have it come out overly salty, so no complaints here!).   My friend had the eggs Benedict, and he loved it. He couldn't finish half because it was on the salty side.  When we were wrapping up the meal one of the owners came by and asked how our food was.  I'll definitely come back to try their French toast--it looks incredible!!",

We grabbed a table and our food was out after a few minutes. The eggs and bacon were pretty standard - good. The potatoes were really good, seasoned nicely, obviously made fresh. The bread. You know, I'm not sure what makes bread really good, but there bread was really good. I had the sourdough and bf had the rye. We both enjoyed our meals, the owner came by to check on us, it was a really good way to start the morning. I'll definitely be back.",

I jokingly said they were getting the chorizo shipped from Mexico. At that time the owner came out to apologize for the long wait that it was at the end of a long rush. Okay...understandable-ish. We then saw the three tables that had all been cleared and sat again around us get their food before getting agitated. Don't apologize for a long rush and then serve the three tables around us while we have been waiting for 40 minutes. At minute 53 a younger man came to the table and rudely dropped one of the two plates on the table without saying anything about the other. Exactly what I wanted, crusty hollandaise sauce and soggy bread on my cold eggs florentine. Minute 55 the second plate arrived with a thick crust over the cold cheese sauce. Terrible way to start my Sunday morning. Needless to say I won't be going back to AZ bread co.",

The potatoes used in the soup very definitely a freeze dried potato or previously frozen, they definitely do not use fresh ingredients.  The sandwich was downright awful. The bread was grilled and left on the grill to long as it was burnt. The roast beef was a grocery store lunchmeat that was tough and chewy.

The workers here are super friendly and the food came out super quick.  If in the area, I definitely would come back.",

    "text": "I come here once in a while when I want something healthier and quick. One of the reasons I like it is because it's a small family owned business.  I ordered a half turkey sandwich, bowl of soup and soda for a little over $11. Not the most inexpensive meal for what it is, but that's ok since the ingredients are fresh and normally the food is pretty good. However, I ordered a chicken noodle soup and it came out with literally with maybe 5 small noodles. It had definitely 90% broth and when I asked if I could get more noodles, they made me feel like it was a ridiculous request as I could overhear them in the kitchen. I think when I order a chicken noodle soup for a premium price, it should have noodles. The last thing I noticed is a sign by the napkins/flatware. It says they provide a quality napkin so please only take what you use so they can keep the same prices. Why not just serve the food to you with one napkin vs having that sign up? I have not seen that anywhere in a restaurant before. So I guess their goal is to save money on noodles, napkins and use of styrofoam cups.",

They have 3 or 4 specials of the day posted at the register....and I have never been disappointed. They have a few outside tables, but they are right on the sidewalk and you are looking at the parking lot. No views to speak of. Very large and clean inside and you order at the counter, and they bring it to you.  Ordering 'to go' does take quite awhile if you are ordering anything from the kitchen, but it is easy to grab a bagel/muffin and coffee.  The owners are also very involved in the community, and always sponsor a food drive during the holidays. I recommend that you support this local restaurant!",

For me, that's the Amanda Burrito: a breakfast burrito with eggs, onions, chorizo, some jalapeno, and cheese. The burrito is served with a side of queso and I consider it liquid heaven. The queso - whether dipped up or spooned on top - is the figurative icing on the cake. I try to get different things but always come back to that burrito.  The staff is so friendly and the owner a very sweet lady. I always feel welcome. It's great to be a regular here.  Also, just as a side note, the passion berry tea (which we drink iced) tastes like waffles with berries on top. Not kidding. It's unsweetened and seriously tastes like dessert. We love it. And we love this place!",

The bread they have is unique for sure, duh, its called a bread company :).    I shall thus point your attention to their omelettes and other creations.which is though not as full as Crackers Cafe down the road, nor overloaded like the good egg or us egg, it does have a certain amount of creativity and uniqueness.  For example, do the az omelette which has a nice creamy hollandise like sauce over the omelette.  Else do the carne adovada, :)  no elaboration needed with a name like carne adovada.  I am gonna go out on a limb here and assume their lunches and breakfast sandwiches are equally good.  I don't know cause I have only been here twice for breakfast and twice I like the casual atmosphere, friendly staff, good breakfast that has not disappointed and overall feel of the place.    Come here and U will like it :) Its not everyday that I find a spot as good as Crackers and Co :)",

We got there perfect time but the wait to order at the counter was a little long for this set up style restaurant. The owner took our order and she was super friendly and kind. The food came out in time and was delicious. My husband had an omelet and I had the chicken fried steak. Everything was decent portions as well. The patio is dog friendly, and inside had a flex table arrangement that accommodates large groups. They have an espresso machine and to die for muffins in the pastry tray as you wait in line. They also have sippy cups with bendable straws for kids drinks, which was a bonus in my book.",

To me, the place seemed like more of an older crowd cafeteria or something very similar. The place is pretty dated and the food was extremely bland. Like something you would get at a retirement home.

(order two!)  For lunch, I love the veggie wrap. Also, they have frequent diner cards.  I love the patio and the fact that they allow dogs. They even provide water for them which is a very thoughtful touch after a hike.  The two things I would change are definitely the bathrooms and the coffee dispensers. Only one person at a time in the bathroom. We are big hikers and the bike clubs frequent here as well. When a group is coming to breakfast from a long hike or ride, you really need more stalls! So if they would somehow reconfigure the bathrooms that would be great!  My other issue is that the coffee is always cold. Good but cold. We always get there later in the morning so maybe they just need better warmers in the coffee dispensers.  Overall, this is one of my favorite places. It's clean, comfortable, good food with healthier choices and the staff is amazing. It is a something for everyone place.",

I was greeted by a sweet guy who was friendly and helpful with my questions. (I had many, I'm sure he was annoyed, but never showed it) The prices are fair for what you get. I have made a mission of mine to go back and have lunch there at some point because the menu looked pretty good.    Everyone at work raved about how good these treats were. I raspberry scone was by favorite. It wasn't too sweet where you'd get a bunch of cavities from eating it, but sweet enough to enjoy with some coffee. You must try their pastries!",

Now mind you this review isn't about the food as it is excellent. I had a really bad experience just now at 9:30 am. I stopped in to get a vegetable Frittata for breakfast. I walked in and the cashier named, \"KATE\" didn't greet me first of all and acted as if I was an intrusion for her (to do her job). She was very curt and cold to me and wouldn't even let me finish a sentence. She continued to act very disinterested in my order. Now mind you I didn't think about her attitude until  after I made my order and paid for it with my credit card, and sat down. I happened to glance back over and saw her flirting with an older white dude. It was obvious that she has an issue with people of color and didn't want to take more order in the first place. As soon as the white dude walked up. She was in his face, going the extra mile with customer service and standing there continuing to flirt and talk. it's obvious that Kate is more interested in using her job as a dating service and not actual work. My other was ready and another older lady came over to give me my order and she was wonderful as always and I asked for the cashier's name. She gave it to me and that is why I'm writing here and giving such a bad review. Get rid of Kate. She will continue to earn you bad reviews for your wonderful restaurant. Not sure if I will return.",

My friend's sandwich was also limp, and in addition, it was too salty.  The service was good and quick. The whole place was spotlessly clean. Their record from the county health dept is excellent.  The side salads look/taste like what you can buy at Fry's deli. Yawn.... I would compare this to a lunch at Subway. Not bad, but not something to go out of your way for, either.",

It's kind of in a funny spot (business/commercial area)  I had planned on getting a sandwich until I walked in and saw the special \"Green Chile and Corn Quiche with zucchini and tomato\" YUM!!!  I had to get it! To my surprise it was a crustless quiche so I no longer felt guilty for eating it and let me tell you it was Absolutely Delicious!! (see pics)  Even though it was technically a breakfast item The girl told me the quiche could be served all day unlike the rest of the breakfast menu which ends at 11am, and Lunch begins at 10:30.  I would definitely vote for that to go on the permanent menu.  I also ended up getting a Tuna to Go. Simple Tuna here, just mayo salt and pepper, then add toppings you like. Comes with a side, I chose the pasta salad (see pics)  It was a tad fishy but was still really good flavor wise and the soft Challah roll was a great compliment. I also like the pasta salad.  A great menu of breakfast and lunch items, seemed more freshly made than most counter establishments. I will definitely be back to this privately owned single location in the valley!  Check it out you wont be disappointed!! Oh Ya~ They have Free Wi-Fi!!",

One of my favorite things about this place is the patio seating, especially since it is now fall (I can say that since we have two days in a row at 75 degrees for the high). Also, the interior is fun and brightly colored with a ton of windows making it full of natural light.

I know the food is sub-par but we're attached to the chain  because each of us hung out there frequently, with our friends, when we were younger.  This morning, I wanted a really good breakfast.  I 'yelped' and this place came up.  I don't know where the rest of the reviewers have been eating but this place is terrible.  The staff isn't friendly.  Just a crew of apathetic 20-somethings.  The guy at the register seemed annoyed that I had to look at the menu before I ordered.  A girl filling up those little jam baskets took the one from our table and replaced it without so much as an 'excuse me' or 'hello'.  Not even eye contact or a smile.  I ordered pancakes.  It's all I wanted and I wanted good ones, badly.  They were the worst pancakes I've ever had in my life.  I'm not saying that with exaggeration.  The worst I've ever had.  Rubbery, tough and devoid of flavor.  Like eating a lid to a tupperware container.    I eat everything I pay for, bad or not.  I managed to choke down only one of the three.  It took forever to do so because cutting through them was such a chore.  Words just can't describe how bad these were.  My lady got Challah French Toast with a pecan praline topping and it was acceptable.  Coffee was pretty good, honestly.  That's all the good I have to say about this place.",

The salad came out within 15 minutes, but the sandwich took so long that by the time I was ready to eat my salad it was a wilted, slimy mess.

    "text": "During my yearly pilgrimage to Arizona, I usually try to make it a point to try something new while I'm out there. This time, AZ Bread Company caught my eye, thanks to Yelp, boasting fresh ingredients and friendly service. Did they meet my exorbitant expectations?  For the most part, yeah, they did. The environment was welcoming and the people seemed friendly enough. I kept it simple with a half BLTA and broccoli cheese soup, while the wife took a grilled sandwich of some sort (I sadly can't remember which sandwich it was, my bad). I remember the sandwich having a fresh, clean taste, with the bacon being crispy and flavorful and the avocado and sprouts (which I added, free of additional charge) really gave it that extra taste dimension that made it stand out. My only complaint regarding the freshly baked sourdough bread that I had on my sandwich wasn't toasted. I assumed that it would be at least a little toasty, but alas, my assumption, my fault.   The soup on the other hand was a little lackluster. Although it tasted really good, it came to the table on the \"pleasantly warm\" side as opposed to a more appropriate \"hot and satisfying\" temperature.   Overall, AZ Bread Co. is a nice little place to grab a sandwich and be on your way. It seems that they pride themselves on fresh ingredients and house baked bread. Their employees are cheerful and helpful, but just a few minor adjustments are needed to get this place that elusive fifth star in my book.",

That, and the quality of the food, stand out particularly here. I ordered some oatmeal-expecting nothing really special-and what I received was way, way above average: candied walnuts, brown sugar, and perfectly cooked oats with an image fit for a commercial. If they take such time with the little things here, than I'm pretty sure you can imagine how the rest of the food is. I recommend coming for lunch also. You can't go wrong either way! :)  Update:   I came back and tried a few more things after my first visit. Breakfast is where its at! I had the Montoya Skillet, and it was delightful. Check the picture out. That is jalapeno queso on top. Once the fork pierces through the egg, one's tastebuds are treated to chorizo, green chile, and onions on a bed of breakfast potatoes. Hungry yet? :)",

I had the cheesy tortilla soup with it.  It was a little too fake nacho cheese flavored for me.  I would have liked it more if it had tasted more like natural and not processed cheese.  I would most definitely try this place for breakfast because the burritos look delicious in pictures.",

You place your order at the front and sit down and wait for your food to come out.  There are workers that come around and ask if you need anything, much like a restaurant where you have to leave tips for the servers...but here you are not expected to!  I love that.  I hate dining out because it is so expensive to begin with and then you have to leave a tip on top of that.    Anyway,  I had the pecan waffles for breakfast, AMAZING!! It was very sweet though so you must have a sweet tooth.  The homemade mango smoothie was awesome as well.   A few cons... This place needs more bathrooms.  Only one stall for each gender.  My husband waited our entire stay because one guy was hogging up the bathroom with probably the largest load ever.  My husband could not wait any longer and had to sneak into the woman's bathroom while I stood guard, haha. Also, they use Styrofoam cups.  I shed a tear for the environment that day ;(",

This is the type of place where you place your order, gather your cup from the order-taker and get your own flatware and take a seat. At first that \"station\" was a bit unorganized but with customer feedback became very efficient. Carol would even Thank whomever provided a specific idea if she used it.

Classic Breakfast Sandwich - this how I order it, 3 eggs, turkey sausage, American cheese on a spinach tortilla. now I understand they charge me a $1.25 for the third egg. so her is my problem, for the last year or better yet the last 6 month they do not get the price right. one day it is $5.49 the next time it is $6.49, well today 08/16/2012 the owner charges me $7.49, why is it they can not get the price right? then when I say something they want to get an attitude when I say something about the price? I not rich, I work hard for my money, but there is not one reason at all a customer should ever feel like they are in the wrong. correct the matter and move froward. my point is that you should not be treat this way no matter what, and I understand that they need to make there money, but how many other people are they doing this too? I know my little $6.00 bucks does not mean anything to them, but it does to me. like I said I have been going there for 5 years because the food is great, but do not keep take my money and act like I am the one in the wrong when I question the price, when I know what the price is, because this all I ever get from there....",

As an east coast city girl I know great food and the valley of sun has great options.   I have visited AZ bread company for lunch more than 5 times, it's right near my office and the salads are really great. I've thought it was a bit overpriced, but not grossly so.   This morning I stopped by for my first breakfast experience. I asked for a bagel with egg and cheese and brown mustard (sold other places for $3-3.50. What I was told is that I would be charged for a breakfast sandwich with no meat. I assumed this was some kind of deduction from the price of the full sandwich. With a coffee my bill was $7.11 after tax. When I asked why it was so expensive I was pretty much given a \"sorry.\" On their menu a bagel is $.99, an egg is $.95 and I can't imagine cheese can be more than $1. I should have been charged $3 not $5. I mentioned this to the cashier with no luck. What I was handed was a bagel with American cheese (YUCK) and an egg and honey mustard (the wrong mustard). I should have been asked what kind of cheese I wanted.   In this economy gouging a new customer and then handing them the wrong food just doesn't fly. Sorry AZ, I won't be back. Kind of a shame...loved those salads.",

Ordered a couple of eggs with pork sausage, and 9 grain toast.  The sausage is very tasty.  We also had their green chili corn quiche with pepperjack cheese.  Very good.  The strawberry waffles were pretty good but not great.  Not trying to be too critical but I eat breakfast at a lot of great places and these are good but in line with what many good places will offer.  On the other hand, there are some places that have incredible waffles and french toast, not necessarily in AZ.  Either way, the staff was very good, food came relatively fast, and I would probably go back for a bite.  One little beef is that they should use butter or oil when cooking their eggs.  They use what I like to call fake butter or margarin.  You can always smell it when it's used in cooking eggs.  I know it's cheaper and lasts forever but frankly the other alternatives are just better.  Go check it out and make your own opinions known.",

I went to the restaurant with my dog and we sat outside.  I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and a cup of hot tea and paid for my order.  I waited outside by the table.  The waiter brought the bagel but no tea.  I didn't want to get my dog and my stuff and go back into the  restaurant while I was eating so I waited until I was finished.  I went back and told my waitress that I believed I paid for the hot tea and never received it.  She said I did pay for it.  The waiter told me I needed to limit my time in the restaurant with my dog.  The owner came and asked if she could take my dog outside. I asked why they say they allow dogs.  She said that I have to bring someone else with me and they can stay outside with the dog while I order my food. First of all, I would not have had to come back into the restaurant if they had gotten my order correct and given me what I paid for.  Second, my dog is a puppy that I am trying to socialize and get used to people.  She does not bother anyone.  I left without my tea.  I believe that dogs are allowed outside ALLrestaurants.  This restaurant is nothing special.  I will never return.  The customer service is awful.",

This gem of a cafe is easy to pass by, but stop in and give it a try. I had some of everyone's orders at my table....my friends' Blueberry Muffin (amazing!), strawberry french toast (which was delicious, considering I don't like French Toast and never order it), and the hashbrowns/breakfast potatoes also hit the spot.  Can't wait to go back...this is a great little joint to go to for a weekend brunch when you don't have to be on your diet. And, the prices are just right. MMMM I want a bagel right now.",

The pecan french toast melts in your mouth, the eggs benedict's hollandaise sauce is amazing, and the vegetable frittata or the ajo breakfast wrap will certainly satisfy. Did I mention the large portions and the side of mouthwatering potatoes? I also like to try to be a little healthy, so the choice of egg beaters or whites is appealing. Finally, the owner is always around and she is super nice. She runs a great business, and its great to see her involvement with the diners. Oh and did I mention... ITS AMAZING!",

I was running errands in the neighborhood and came in for lunch. I ordered the carne adovada sandwich at peak lunch time, about 12:15. It's a big sandwich on a French roll and it was just plain bad. The roll was microwaved and tough, chewy. I mean, you put the word 'bread' in the title of your restaurant. Yikes. The meat was over stewed and over salted by a long shot. The only other component of the sandwich is an equally salty and processed-tasting liquid cheese sauce. Nothing fresh on the sandwich at all? I was starving but couldn't bring myself to eat any more of it. I took it home to my husband because he has a deep, abiding love for any sort of slow cooked pork dish and even he wouldn't take more than a bite. They need to take a look at the dishes they're serving and inject some life into them. It should be better--and it wouldn't be hard to improve.",

Challah bread is one of my top 5 favorite bread! It also came with a side, and I picked a red potato salad.  The potato salad was ok.  The sandwich was a good looking sandwich full of color, it had yellows, reds, greens it just was a pretty looking sandwich. It tasted even better than it looked! The Challah roll, man that was delish, I'm sure I could have easily eaten that without the sandwich stuffing haha.

There customer service was great too. Everyone was so nice and very helpful.    We also got a few more sandwich wraps for the plane ride home and that was sooo delicious.    Food is very tasty!  Perfect to hit the spot and comfortable",

They have an indoor and outdoor dining area and are dog friendly.",

Staff has no personality and questionable training. The place is cluttered. The food quality is not near as good as it had been.

    "text": "FAMILY OWNED, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, DELICIOUS FOOD, BIG PORTIONS, WELL PRICED This is the first time I've been here. I always thought it was a chain restaurant, but it turns out it's a mom and pop restaurant owned by a very nice lady, Carol. She's genuinely friendly and checks on her customers. I noticed she knew her regulars by name, was bussing tables herself, holding open doors for people and checking on the customers. When she came by to check on me, she cleared one of my plates, and we chatted for a bit. She even asked my name. When I was talking to her, I found out she was the owner.  ATMOSPHERE - Friendly, Casual, Indoor and Patio Self-Seating You order at the counter, and they give you a number. You can sit inside or out side on the patio area wherever there's an open table. You put your number on the stand on the table and they bring your food out to you. Maybe it just happened to be the day, but the customers were also super friendly.  DOG FRIENDLY PATIO I also noticed people had their dogs on the patio. One of the girls that works here went up to a table and asked if they wanted some dog treats for their pup.  FOOD - DELICIOUS, LARGE PORTIONS, WELL PRICED I ordered the Strawberry French Toast, an egg sunny side up and a side of potatoes. Good thing I brought my appetite! The food was delicious and it came out faster than I anticipated, especially with it being a busy Sunday morning. The food was delicious. The egg was perfectly cooked, the potatoes had a great flavor, I didn't even use ketchup or hot sauce with them and the French toast was amazing and the strawberries were really fresh. The soy latte with caramel was awesome! I may have found my new favorite coffee place!",

Spring mix lettuce, carrots, peppers, mushrooms. Not your ordinary side salad! And the honey mustard dressing is fantastic.   I have also eaten The East Coast Panini (pastrami, sauerkraut on rye), The Scottsdale (roast beef, red peppers on sourdough) and several other sandwiches. All top notch. Their red potato salad is also fantastic.   The service is stellar as well. The counter people are always really friendly and quick. Your food comes fast and I've never had a mistake in my order.

She even made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  I usually go with my staple, the grilled chicken sandwich.  I usually get this when i am in the mood for heartburn, since it comes with cheese, tomato, lettuce, and my heartburn favorite, Green Chiles....yummy!  I love it that they serve it on a Challah role...  I always polish off my meal with their chocolate chip cookies, that are out of this world.  Will update when I go there for breakfast.

AZ Bread Co is located in a nondescript strip mall, right on the corner w/plenty of parking spaces all around.   I ordered the Amanda burrito with a side of queso and my husband had his usual, ham and cheese omelet. Our food arrived quickly and piping hot. You pay at the register and then take your number and go sit down in the spacious and very clean dining room   The joint is beautifully decorated and much of the art on the walls is for sale. Of course I purchased one and it truly is lovely. The restrooms are beautifully decorated and very clean. The staff was not overly nice but neither were they unfriendly, pretty much just doing their job.   There was an older man working there whom I felt really sorry for because he looked as though he was serving out a life sentence.   We both ate for a little over $20 including drinks and if we lived there, we would def be customers. There are many tables and chairs outside if you're brave enough to eat outside and as always, I would much rather give my money to a family biz than some big restaurant chain...maybe when you're a regular there friendlier but the food was wonderful.",

We got there around 10 and it wasn't very busy, we didn't have to wait long and easily got a table. So I wrestled with what to give this place star wise. The lady who owns the restaurant was really nice, she even came by our table and said hello. Additionally, the employees were nice. The food was just meh, not terrible by any means, but not good or memorable in any way....so I had to go with the 2 (sorry guys). I had the eggs florentine and, though the eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was not made correctly. It was very acidic and tasted not good, which kind of put a damper on the whole thing (as it covered all of the food). The bread was good, but it got soggy quickly (which is why I think they traditionally use english muffins). The potatoes were mealy and not crispy at all. I barely ate any of them because they were that meh. The BF got the strawberry pancakes. The pancakes were flavorless....like puffy white bread, but with less flavor. I figure a place is fairly meh when their pancakes are worse than those at Ihop. I even said to the BF that if this place were the only breakfast place in town....I would probably just cook at home. Now, it could have been an off day, and I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I probably would drive out of my way to go here again.",

I prefer my french toast a little lighter and fluffier and I also thought the syrup that was put on it a bit on the heavy and thick side (it crystallized and harden up towards the end of my meal).  The pork in the Carne Adovada was nicely seasoned and really tasty...but my scrambled eggs were overcooked and a bit too hard and dry and my potatoes undercooked (so they were a bit soggy).  I also liked the jalapeno queso...but there wasn't enough of it to enjoy w/all the pork that was on the plate.

He said they used to serve better Bacon and this was a cheaper version of something eatable.                                       Other than that though very good. I liked the coffee it was quite strong. The pieces of bread that they give you for Toast are huge, also very good. They don't have coupons which is a bit of a bummer. However, If you are looking to splurge this is the place.

Their sandwiches are delicious and they have a solid variety.  The sandwiches may look simple on the menu but you can add a bunch of veggies to really flavor it up.    The style is a seat yourself, and wait for the food to arrive type.  I like the laid back style, nice decor, and fresh and delicious food.  Owner is super friendly and appreciates the customer.  Each time I have gone I wonder why I don't go more often, then I realize the hours.  I only give it 4.9 stars for not staying open long enough to allow me to eat there every meal!  Fresh bread, and meat and veggies.  What more can you ask?  I can't wait to try new things on the menu.    To the person who complained about the price of a bagel-egg-cheese sandwich I would like to remind you that it is a BREAD COMPANY not a bagel shop!  I would have charged you $10 bucks for being silly enough to order the bagel.  2nd of all, no one ever asks you what kind of cheese you want on a bagel, it is always American by default, even at a bagel shop.  If you wanted something different then ask, they do not read minds.",

My only gripes are that they don't serve mimosas (or any alcohol) during brunch, and they don't serve any fresh squeezed OJ (only the yucky bottled stuff) which is why I couldn't quite give them 5 stars.",

Everything sounded really good on their menu but I decided to go with the southwest chorizo Benedict. & my girl got the carne adovada with over medium eggs & her choice of toast. Food came out super quick! And both dishes were pretty amazing. The poached egg on the Benedict was cooked to perfection. Each dish is affordable and the portions were a pretty decent size.   Upon walking in, they take your order at the counter. You get a number and choose your own table. Dont forget to grab your utensils after paying before you sit down! They have a shelf of sauces you can choose from to enjoy with your meal. After you are finished eating, you can leave your plates at the table and staff comes around to pick it up. This place is very clean & organized!  Only reason why I knocked a star of my review is because I feel like their customer service could have been a little more friendly. Upon our arrival to AZ Bread, my girl and I checked in on yelp & noticed that they offered a free drink via yelp check in offer. The older lady behind the register was like \"just give them the drinks, I guess\" with an attitude and gave us the side eye. It's just a drink, wasnt a big deal. If they didnt want to honor the check in offer coupon then she could have just said so and we could have just purchased them instead.",

    "text": "This pains me to do as I used to be a regular here and live around the corner. I used to eat here 1-2x a week and would often grab breakfast here on the way to work. My most recent trip will be my last.   I have a pretty severe dairy sensitivity that was recently diagnosed. Some things aren't as bad as others, but for whatever reason, cheese will ruin the next 24 hours. I always order my breakfast burritos here with no cheese. I normally just grab it on the go and eat it at work. At least half a dozen times, they load that bad boy up with cheese. By the time I notice, I am already in the morning sales training I lead for my reps. They probably love it since once a week someone gets a free burrito as I can't eat it.  This most recent time, it was a weekend so I actually had time to bring the burrito back after they messed it up. It's frustrating because the ticket definitely says no cheese, but as you can see from the picture below, it's almost like they are trying to spite me. That much cheese is absurd even if it wouldn't tear me up.   I get home and get ready to eat and see this cheesy monstrosity. I call them and say they screwed it up and ask them to make me another since I cannot eat this. I get in my car and drive back and am waiting at the counter unacknowledged for a good 5 minutes. Finally, a younger girl comes over and snaps at me, \"Yeah we know. We're making you another one.\" Great customer service. I offer to give them the burrito back since I cannot eat it and she responds, \"Just give it to one of your friends.\" LOL OK. Have probably been here at least 50 times and will absolutely never be back.",

I had interactions with 3 different employees and they were all incredibly rude. This was so surprising to me because I have never been treated so poorly & I am not easily offended. Upon arriving the lady taking my order was rolling her eyes at me, I asked her questions & she was just shrugging her shoulders at me. When the second woman brought out my food I asked her for cream cheese & she completely ignored me & pretended not to hear me after I had asked for cream cheese when I ordered my bagel & it was forgotten & she just walked away. I got up to ask her AGAIN for the 3rd time now for 2 cream cheeses & the man in the kitchen gave her one & I said I asked for 2 & he rolled his eyes & said \"TWO?!\". I ordered something to go after finishing my food & stood there for over 3 minutes when One of the cooks finally helped take my order & he was the only nice one, a young guy. When my burrito was done the lady that was rolling her eyes at me taking my order the first time handed it to me & didn't say anything just handed it to me. My sister was also treated poorly, she ordered right after me & received the same \"customer service\" from these shitty people. When leaving the same nice young guy told us to have a great day on our way out then as I was getting in the car the rude cream cheese man yelled out for us to have a great day after being extremely rude as if he was making fun of us. Horrible experience overall & I will never be back here. Also, the silverware was disgusting. I had to go through multiple forks to see one that looked the \"cleanest\"",

She wouldn't even look at the menu to see what we were talking about, instead just told us she didn't know what we were talking about and made us go all the way to the front to see the specials again to get the exact name of the French toast. Then was very rude when we didn't understand what she was trying to say about a mug or to go cup, like dang women calm down.

    "text": "I recently started a new job in the Tempe area and I'm more than happy to try all the restaurant in the area for breakfast and lunch.  One of the first places I tried was AZ Bread Company for breakfast.  I am so, so, so glad I did.  I love a good sandwich, breakfast, lunch, dinner, doesn't matter. I love bread! Hungry and wanting something new, I searched Yelp for breakfast near me.  AZ Bread Company popped up with 4.5 stars.  I looked over the menu and decided to give them a call and place an order.   There were tons of options for sandwiches I've never heard of.  I like originals - score! I decided on The Phoenician.  The Phoenician is a sandwich that has scrambled eggs, honey smoked bacon, roasted tomatoes, sauteed onions and cheddar on a grilled ciabatta roll.  I'm not a fan of ciabatta rolls at all so I asked the person on the phone what other bread did they have besides white and wheat.  He answered with slight irritation, you can have any bread in the store for your sandwich. I politely told him I've never eaten here before and the bread options aren't listed on the breakfast menu (as they should be IMO).  He sighed, and told me my options.  I went with the Challah bun.  Great choice!  The sandwich was nothing like I expected.  I expected a layered breakfast sandwich with eggs, bacon, roasted tomato, cheese and sauteed onions. The sandwich came kind of omelet style. Everything was all cooked together then put on the Challah bun. Still delicious!  The roasted tomato was a really nice addition to the sandwich. My job is located about 11 minutes from AZ Bread Company. When I placed my order he said it would be 3-5 minutes.  Wow!  Next time I won't order ahead of time, there's really no need.  AZ Bread Company has a check offer.  If you get a free soft drink or coffee on them.  I checked in and redeemed my order.  The man that took my order was also the man at the cash register (I could tell from him voice and his non-friendly demeanor).  I told him I'd like to redeem my check in off and get a hot cup of coffee.  He gave me a HUGE soft drink cup, maybe a 20 ounce cup.  I opted for Dr. Pepper instead.  I'll definitely be returning!",

I am also extremely happy that it is 5 minutes away from work, that makes it so convenient as well.  I have tried the following items:  -Turkey Avocado BLT wrap. Even though they forgot the Avocado, which was a bummer, but the wrap was still really good. You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients.  -Fireman Ruben, excellent warm sandwich, they do not skimp on the turkey, it is almost too much, almost! -Carne Adovada, EXCELLENT! Although a touch too salty, otherwise just a simple well flavored sandwich and very fresh bread.  I highly recommend AZ Bread company, and I can't waiting to continue to try their different items on the menu. I am also looking forward to trying breakfast there one day.   It is nice to have a healthy filling option for a quick and/or relaxed lunch!",

I only mention that because the whole place seemed filled with happy, and child friendly folks from the neighborhood. The reviews that talk about fast service are spot on. The food and coffee was good, and my most prestigious critics, my kids, said it was better than their favorite place back home. I only give it a 4 because of the lack of gluten free options outside of the standard egg dishes, and the person who took my order didn't seem very knowledgeable about GF diets. Its not all their fault. I was hoping for better options for my daughter who has celiac and yelp had this place listed under Gluten Free.  Good breakfast, great service, and nice neighborhood eatery atmosphere.",

I got challah french toast w/ eggs & bacon and DH ordered The Wrangler.  Their breakfast potatoes are great.  I would love to return, but it's a little far from my house.

There are tons of tables and chairs, so you'll be hard pressed to not find a seat.  The ordering system is perfect for breakfast, you place your order, get a number, and sit down.  The drinks are self serve so it's really nice to not have to wait for any servers when you are STARVING like I always am at breakfast time.  Everyone who works here is quick and efficient, running like a well oiled machine.  Now the food....  Do yourself a HUGE favor and get over here on the weekend!  They advertise a pecan waffle, pancake, or french toast special here on yelp.  I decided I would have that.  BEST DECISION EVER!  It was so amazingly good.  The waffle was fluffy and sweet and the pecan compote was dreamy.  Just imagine loads of caramelly sweet crunchiness covering an already perfect waffle.  Are you in heaven now?  You should be.  I promise it will be mind blowing.  I kind of love this place, as if you couldn't tell already.  I am going to be trying to find excuses to make our way down here more often!",

    "text": "Whoa.  Rarely...RARELY!...is there a breakfast place that I give 5 stars.  It has to be as good as Matt's to get five stars from me.  That is not an easy thing to do but the AZ Bread Co has been successful.  This place is a jewel and should be in every major city.  To start, the setup is perfect.  A long counter to order your food at with pastries visible from the entrance and a large menu.  They take your order and you go sit and wait for it.  No stupid cluster of people in the entrance like at Scramble, so waiting for tables like at Matt's - you order and you wait for your food.  If the place is packed, you can sit outside.  No room outside, get it to go.  You can eat the stuff in your damn car if you like.  They have a soda fountain with Coke and if that doesn't deserve an extra star, I don't know what does. But all of that stuff becomes inconsequential when you start talking food.  The pecan french toast is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  Their chalah bread is killer and makes the perfect french toast.  The pecan topping is so rich but oh so good.  I've also had the strawberry pancakes.  They are not covered in a strawberry sauce like most places do it.  Just pancakes, fresh cut strawberries, and some fresh whipped cream.  Yum.  The pancakes are perfect as well. There isn't anything I can find to complain about this place other than - it is far away.  Maybe one day they will open one downtown.  Until then, I don't mind driving 15 minutes to get there.",

I didn't feel the service was at all tremendous. The girl that brought my food sat it down and said the silverware is at the front. Not sure why they didn't tell me that in the first place or she didn't get it for me. My food came quickly which was the best part. The food was fine. I was going to use the bathroom before I left and the girl was cleaning it. I just said \"oh you're cleaning.\" And expected to wait but her response just made me want to leave.

Here are some of my favorite must try's:  BREAKFAST:  If you are feeling decadent go for the Pecan Waffles.  Oh my oh my how they call my name.  It's like waffles meet sticky buns! If you're feeling like a classic the Wrangler is the way to go:  three eggs, bacon and crispy potatoes.   And when I want to spice up my life I order the Ajo Breakfast Wrap.  It's scrambled eggs with green chili, bacon, onion and cheddar cheese all wrapped up.  So good.  LUNCH recommendations:  The Carne Adovada Sandwich is bomb.  Get it with a side of the chips and caso, this stuff is addictive.     If I'm in a light mood I'll go with the Asian Almond Salad or sometimes they have a gorgeous strawberry salad on the specials board. A great classic: The BLT.  I like to get it with a cup of yummy soup.    So yeah, I really like eating here.  A lot.

However, I thought this was pretty pre-mature and perhaps I should wait, finish my meal, experience the after-taste and then analyze and review.   With the  help of the very friendly employee, I chose the Pick Two - getting a half chicken salad sandwich and a cup of potato cream cheese soup. I waited for maybe, three minutes for my food, when another employee brought it over to me and I was ready to go!  I went again today for breakfast (yogurt swirl and a banana nut muffin) and with these trips I feel qualified to give a meaningful review.  Other than the the friendly/helpful employees and speedy service, the other highlights include -  1) convenient location to tons of offices (one being mine) and next to my bank (Chase),  2) and easy, likeable menu,  3) tons of soups - honestly, sometimes for lunch all I want is soup... and tasty soup at that! 4) FRESH bread - I think people take bread for granted!  Um, okay, so that's it. But seriously, so good. Will be a permanent lunch option for me",

Very reasonable price at a time when a good breakfast in Phoenix can easily add up to $15 per person.  They were both tasty and fresh.  The potatoes had some little pieces of green and red bell pepper mixed in, so that added a little extra to the overall flavor.  The wrap had a good bit of chorizo and the eggs tasted fresh.  The atmosphere has a good vibe (other than the one family in there eating among which there existed one or more of them who needed a shower.  I think that was the exception, not the rule, however.)  I'd definitely rate this among the Top 15 breakfasts in town.",

This is a big deal for 2 reasons A) My mom is a vegetarian and it's hard for her to find things to eat out, and B) She's really picky about quality & service. I had never eaten here, but chose it out of 6 other places I was considering! The main thing that clinched it for me was that it had different breakfast items that most places don't have, and that they had a lot more vegetarian friendly options. So, the day came and my mom ordered the Garden Frittata, which she was so excited to see on the menu and she loved it! I ordered the Strawberry Waffles, which were so good I have really been dreaming about them and looking for an opportunity to go back, and one egg over medium (which they cooked correctly). My Dad ordered a breakfast sandwich, which he liked very much, but said he wished he ordered the Strawberry Waffles once he saw mine!   We went over there at noon to miss the huge Mother's Day crowd, that proved smart because it was not crowded at all.   The only cons were that the people who work there seem terse and not very friendly. It's something I can put up with because the food was so good, but I wish I wouldn't have to. When we chose a seat my mom politely asked a nearby person who worked there to clean it off since there were no clean tables. They seemed affronted at this request. She had also wanted to push two tables together but the person who worked there didn't want her to do this and was kinda rude about it.",

For 8 bucks  I had 4 strawberry pancakes, turkey sausage and a scrambled egg. I finished my plate because it was so good, but  I ended up being so mad at myself for doing so. Their coffee was good, and they also provide flavored creamers.  They have a wide variety of food from savory breakfast plates to sweet pancakes. They even serve lunch.

I ordered the Amanda Burrito which was a chorizo and egg burrito with peppers and onions and a side of the jalapeno queso. The burrito was a great size and it was delicious. The jalapeno queso came out with a film on the top like it had been sitting for a bit before coming to the table. I politely pushed the film over to the side of the bowl and enjoyed nonetheless. The staff was friendly and attentive and we were checked on multiple times to see if we needed anything. I would definitely be back.",

    "text": "After reading other Yelper's reviews, my expectations were built up pretty high.  AZ Bread Company is a great place, no doubt, but I somehow feel let down.  Everyone talks about how friendly the owners are and how they've been approached by them to ask how their meal was etc.  One of the owners was out cleaning and bussing tables and he talked to about three families right next to me but never came to ask me how my meal was.  Whatever.    The place is set up like Jason's Deli or Chipotle in that you line up and order your meal then fetch your own drink and finally seat yourself.  They give you a laminated number tag that you can place at your table and when your order is ready they bring it to you.  They don't (or didn't for me, at least) bring your silverware to you.  I thought that was kind of lame.  They didn't even offer upon delivering the food and noticing that we had no utensils to eat with.    The food, however, was definitely way above average.  I had breakfast there with my daughter and she had Strawberry French Toast and I had the breakfast special which was a breakfast burro with eggs, chorizo, cheese and a couple veggies.  My daughter had a bottled cranberry juice and I had coffee.  The total ran $18 which is way more than reasonable for breakfast of this quality.    I like drink stations.  I like being able to get a half cup 'warm up' and being able to get up and look around as I get my drink.  The big windows here are great for the ambient light they lend to the experience where you're eyes aren't hammered having to adjust to artificial light in dimly lit places.  The place is really colorful as well which is very inviting and festive.   All in all, it's a very safe place to bring your old ass grandparents and sketchy inlaws where you don't have to worry about freaking anyone out with a bad breakfast choice.  This place screams 'www.stuffwhitepeoplelike.com'.    You probably fit the demographic, so go there.",

Az bread company is a solid breakfast provider.  Its an express style place, you order at the register, pay, they give you a number placard etc. There are a few healthier choices, my wife got the power wrap, spinach, mushrooms, eggwhites in a spinach tortilla. They also have traditional breakfast staples. Skillets, omeletes and the like. Its a smaller place, in a strip mall suite, with lots of windows and natural light. And every table has an electrical outlet. Seems inviting to people interested in using laptop or tablet. Not sure about wifi, i didnt ask. In summation, az bread co. Is exactly what they advertise, and all the employees seem happy to be there, and those are my requirements for a 5 star review , so there you have it.",

Another 10 minutes and more folks who arrived after us being served so inquire again and told next again.... after the fourth table being served and 45 minutes we had enough and just wanted our money back. no one ever apologized for any of this. Then while waiting for a manager to apply the refund the expo person, who I suspect lost our order, approaches us and begins verbally assaulting us to \"leave her store with our attitude\"... attitude? no attitude given just frustrated and hungry!? 45 minutes for eggs and already prepared carne adovado and queso... wow is all I can say",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place and I hate writing bad reviews for local establishments. I work a couple of blocks away at university of phoenix and thinking this place is the same as the az bread company that comes to the downtown farmer's market I recommended this place to everyone. I had never been here but figured it had the same quality. it does not.  I come for coffee sometimes and first of all if you are going to do specialty coffees and compete with dutch brothers and starbucks learn to do it right. I don't mind spending 3-6 bucks on coffee depending on what I get but it for sure needs to be good. I got a couple of their frozen drinks during the summer. They have little coffee in them. When I asked for an extra shot I was informed it is $2 a shot. Um again dutch brothers on rural and guadalupe. Go there instead and it's $0.50. Now back to the coffee experience. I went again today thinking how bad of an experience can a basic iced coffee be? It's about $2/60 for an ice coffee so not that badly priced, flavor is extra. I asked for a large. They don't do large except in hot coffee. So if you want iced, which is plain coffee dilluted with ice and water you can only get a 10oz coffee. Excuse me???? I asked for pumpkin flavor and either they charged me and only put in half pump or never put it in at all. I asked about it and the lady says 'oh well you wouldn't be able to see the flavor.\" mmmmk but in a quality establishment I should be able to taste it right?? I call foul here. Terrible place for coffee.  Ok so now onto the food...  The sandwiches are lackluster. My friend got a grilled cheese and a drink which was almost $10. The grilled cheese was soft and not grilled at all. Do we see a problem here? My bagel was grocery store quality. Another co-worker reported getting an iceberg salad. I just don't understand how this place survives with so many good places in this area.   If you want coffee go to dutch brothers. If you want baked goods go to the croissant place down the street, and if you want a good basic sandwich go to the safeway a little further down. But skip this overpriced 'bakery'",

I was there to pick up right on time but it looked like my food had been sitting for a few minutes on the counter, not being kept warm. My panini is cold but the soup is hot. Not very impressed with the flavor of the sandwich but the soup is very good as always. For a $5 sandwich, I also expected a little bigger.  So, one star knocked off for the panini. Another knocked off for the service. The first time I called to find out what the soups were, the girl couldn't hear me so I called back. The man who helped me was gruff and short on the phone (I thought it was a reasonable question since the soups aren't posted online but oh well). When I came in, the line was long so I was patiently waiting til I saw the \"ring bell if you ordered ahead\" sign. I rang the bell. Quietly, without demand or force. I got no reply. I wasn't going to ring it again even though I assumed they didn't hear it since there was no acknowledgement but someone else in the line commented that since the staff didn't say anything, they probably hadn't heard it. So I rang it again. A little louder but not slamming my hand down on the thing.  The man responded \"I heard you the first time!\" as if I were ringing and ringing and ringing in a rude manner. I was taken aback but not surprised; the service here isn't that great but that's why it's a counter and not table service, I reckon. I did not expect, nor did I appreciate, a side of chastisement with my lunch",

We both agreed it is delicious. I had the \"Scoop Salad\" man, was it delicious the veggies were very fresh and the dressing was amazing. The next time I went in I had the \"Sedona\". It was amazing. Give it a try. A co-worker brought in some muffins from here one day and those were so delicious and very moist!",

    "text": "On my way to work I would stop in this place to get a muffin. Pretty decent apparently made daily. They also serve pancakes and waffles. Twice I've ordered scrambled eggs and cheese and twice I got sort of a omelet with no cheese kind of brown on the bottom. I like omelets when I want one, but I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese. You can cook eggs many different ways, scrambled eggs should not taste or look like omelets. So google how to make a omelet or do a 2 hour how to cook a freaking egg class. The home fries are deep fried cubes no onions, peppers or herbs, basically French fries but tasteless. Sometimes on Friday I treat myself to my favorite meal of the day, breakfast. From here on out I will only buy their brand muffins. 2 stars because staff is ok. Who ever owns this place should put more care into their kitchen staff.",

The staff is very friendly and welcoming.  There's plenty of seating as well!  I tried the Amanda Burrito.  The burrito itself was already tasty, but the side of queso that it came with made it perfect.  Beverage refills were conveniently accessible with the fountain machines not being in the kitchen.  Pricing was very reasonable (approx $9 for a burrito and fountain drink).  I would most definitely be coming back here again.",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the girl at the register on Sunday mornings is very rude. She is a young girl and just looks annoyed every time we come in. I know they were training someone else when we were in last time, so hopefully they put her in the kitchen away from the customers!",
