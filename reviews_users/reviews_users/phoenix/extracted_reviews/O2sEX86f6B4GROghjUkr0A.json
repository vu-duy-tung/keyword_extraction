    "text": "I ordered take out from this place for me and some friends and I agree with some reviews but not others.    First, the delivery took a long time (1hr) but they did say it would be that long.  They did come within the hour.  I ordered the vegetable tempura and it was awful.  The veggies were mushy and they were more bread than vegetable.    I'm not a fan of Thai generally since I don't like curry nor anything spicy.  But i do like Japanese and Chinese food so i stayed with what was familiar.  I ordered their appetizer platter but it too was terrible.  it was like a plate of fried bread.  I also had their spring roll, pot stickers and Crab Ragoon.  I don't know what they call them but the spring rolls were not spring rolls were hardly spring rolls.  The pot stickers and Crab Ragoon were a hit and delicious.  For my entree i ordered sweet and sour chicken.  It was great.  The chicken was good and flavorful.  I gave them 3 stars since they delivered on time, my order was correct and my entree was great.  if they get a handle on their breadding appetizers then I think this would be a great place. I plan to actually eat at the restaurant today so I will update my review accordingly.",

That was fine and I figured I would just pick them off but after mixing everything including I decided to just crush a few chips on top. The dressing was peanut based. Oh my gosh I think I found my new favorite salad from here. It was amazing. The fresh mint really brought it up a notch.  My spouse stuck with her standard pad Thai which she loved. We each had to have a Thai tea again. It is the perfect after dinner dessert.",

The shrimp fried rice was second to none, no peas( I hate them) it was flavorful unlike most you get at a Chinese restaurant. The beef with garlic sauce was good but I needed more. The Thai tea was the best I've ever had. This is now our go to place when we order Thai take out.

We had a big dinner order of teriyaki chicken, orange chicken, pad thai, and red curry with an order of spring rolls and Thai iced tea. Delivery by Postmates was crazy fast, even during traffic! We got our order in about a half hour, despite an original estimate of an hour.  That seemed to be the highlight. The orange chicken tasted too sweet, and the teriyaki chicken didn't seem like it had been stirfried, but boiled in runny, watery sauce. The pad thai had good flavor, but had completely congealed together in the container, the noodles overcooked. Even the rice had gone mushy.   The best item was the red curry, which was absolutely delicious. It was flavorful and a little hotter than I expected, but perfect! I would come back just for that.  Overall, disappointed after spending almost $50. Maybe dine in is better than delivery...",

The music was probably what made the experience worse it was like lullaby trance music lol. The prices were kind of expensive as well for simple things you'll see yourself that everything seems to be $1 extra from what you would see normally at Thai restaurants- however the extra dollar doesn't mean your get more quality for your buck hence why I was disappointed. Overall, i have had better and probably wouldn't be going back. Good in dire circumstances but there's probably better options in the area.",

I ask them to add mushrooms to it sometimes, but it's tender beef and the sauce is GREAT!   I've tried their curry,  I've tried their pad woon sen, both are very good. I like it spicy!  This place has some awesome appetizers as well. I liked the coconut shrimp and stuffed wings.   There are plenty of other items I want to try but haven't yet.

On a whim, I stopped in, feeling like some veggies, I ordered up some tempura. I know, I know, tempura is fried and it sorta unqualified veggies as a healthy option, but why the heck not!  The tempura had tons of breading had to be a solid 1/2 inch thick, it was more like caked than lightly battered, I picked the batter off and ate the few veggies that tasted ok. Still on the healthy-esq kick, I went with garlic chicken sub veggies for the rice. Well, the chicken was *way overcooked, and seriously under flavored, and the veggies, the vegetables were not even palatable, think out of a can or freezer then boiled.   I didn't even dent the meal, they asked if I wanted the rest to take home... Uhh, You can keep your doggie bag, no thanks!  But the wait staff was super friendly, too bad it doesn't come close to making up for this quality of food.   Happy yelping Phoenix, hope you have a better experience than I, should you also decide to dine in.",

    "text": "This is epic!! Not only did Thai lotus have zero sense, Postmates still charged me!!  Wait! It gets better. The charge (which is typically pending) did not post till a day or two later, and I thought it was their typical \"pending\" fiasco. Nope. It went through 48 hours later and now Postmates is saying they can't do anything beyond 48 hours post order. I'm seriously in the twilight zone. Never use Postmates or Thai Lotus unless you want to pay for imaginary food!   So I attempted to order from Postmates Thai lotus for the 100th time. I've gone to Thai lotus for years and used their delivery service and Postmates numerous times. It's like talking to a brick wall each time. Don't offer \"special instructions\" option if you aren't going to read it and honor it. After numerous deliveries both Postmates and Thai Lotus' delivery guys I was lucky if I had one side order of steamed rice.   I was left with 2 plus curries and no rice. Huh?? Me being naive called Thai lotus after placing my Postmates order ensuring the 4 different special requests for steamed rice were honored or even acknowledged. Keep in mind I've been jipped several times by NO rice even after ordering dishes that accompany rice. After the second person on the phone....I was told it's actually called \"jasmine rice\" since when?  Odd considering your curry dishes say steamed rice...but I move along..after offering several times to pay the $2 charge for an extra side of rice, mind you each curry dish should have one side of rice. I was instructed to cancel my order and redo it because the clueless person on the phone couldn't grasp that a $50 order wasn't worth the $2 extra dollars and I even offered to tip $5 extra to avoid the hassle!! All she said was \"how do i get my money??\" Over and over. Umm hello,l??? open your ears. After being beyond annoyed I cancelled my order and are officially in search of a new Thai restaurant. Get a CLUE!!! No wonder why this place is on the verge of closing their doors. Arguing with me over .05 cents their cost when I offered $5, when they charge $2. Do the math. A complete joke. The only reason I gave 2 stars is they normally have good food.",

I can not tell you how many of their dishes I have ordered but I can tell you that the curries are SPICY and that I have not had a bad dish yet. As of a few days ago delivery had been my preferred way of enjoying all of their wonderful dishes.  I happened to be in the area and decided to bring my roomie there for lunch. She is glad I did and so are her husband and son. After the first stop for lunch, we had to make another one the following day. The only negatives I or my roomies have come across is that the sweet and sour chicken was tooooo sweeet on the second visit and that they serve their pepsi products from cans rather than soda fountains which can make for flat sodas.  I love this place and will until I find somewhere better. The staff is always ready to serve you hand and foot as well, gotta love being taken care of like a king!",

When I suggested they add it she said \"company policy. It is right here on the togo menu\".  We ordered extra peanut sauce and cucumbers with the chicken saute. She took the order (June 28, 2013 4:30pm) but did NOT include the extra sauce we paid for. The garlic chicken: Very dry, no real sauce, cheap cuts of chicken with grizzle. The place still looks like a pancake house, difficult to get to, no atmosphere, no friendly servers (our server did not know the menu, she said we have to tell her the item number not the name). We are giving up. Tried the red curry and the yellow curry, both a waste of money without flavor. We are going to go back to the one on 15th ave and Camelback that we have visited for 10 years.",

Wow! I asked for extra spicy on Eat24 iPhone app and they brought the heat! I can't feel my lips right now but that's what I asked for. Flavor was outstanding! All food was delivered fresh and hot. I got my order in less 30 minutes. This is my GO TO THAI food henceforth.",

Everything was perfect -- both delicious and visually appealing.  This is a great new business that's just starting out, and has lots of potential. I will definitely be back to support this local business!",

    "text": "we decided to visit Thai lotus late on a Friday night and had a decent experience.  they didn't seem upset that we showed up 30 minutes before closing which i was nervous about.  they were just happy we were there.  we live near 19 ave and Glendale and will most likely return if we are craving Thai food and aren't downtown, as i prefer Thai basil.  the server was obviously quite green but very sweet.  the owner, as others have mentioned, was extremely kind and excited to talk with us.  she told us the same things that other reviewers mentioned and asked us to tell our friends to go in since the construction was creating a bit of a challenge.  she gave us a coupon for a free appetizer for next time.  i ordered the pumpkin curry out of curiosity and after reading a review that said the medium wasn't hot enough i decided to order it HOT.  i typically have very high tolerance of heat but, unfortunately, my curry was inedibly hot.  the owner offered to remake it for me but i tolerated as much as i could and took the rest home.  eating it the next day was no easier.  i also ordered peanut sauce on the side and, although it costs $1 extra, i will do that again when we return.  it was delicious.   my husband ordered the spicy basil noodles with HOT spiciness and felt the heat was just right and enjoyed his meal.  we also ordered Thai sausage after some encouragement from our server and enjoyed that quite a lot!  I've actually been thinking about it lately and craving the flavor.",

After a few sit-down dinners and maaaaaany take out dinners, I can honestly say this is my favorite Thai restaurant.  We usually can't help but start out with some spring rolls and thai iced tea which are both always delicious. I tend to go for the yellow curry with tofu, and theirs is superb. I've also tried the pumpkin curry tofu and the orange tofu, both of which were very good. BF usually orders the spicy sweet basil and has never had anything bad to say about it. Also, the coconut ice cream and the fried banana with ice cream are ridiculously good.  I can not say enough about how good the service is. EVERY time we've gone in the servers have been very friendly and welcoming and ready to answer any questions we may have.  Love this place!",

    "text": "I ordered from here through Postmates, because they were one of only four restaurants in my area offering the $2.99 delivery, so I figured why not?   I'm glad I did! I ordered the Massaman curry (medium), Thai iced tea, and Thai pudding with sticky rice. Price-wise, it was a little on the high side. $13 for the curry, and about $6 for the dessert. The curry was good, lots of flavour, though for medium heat it really made me sweat. If that was a medium, I'd hate to see how hot the REALLY hot stuff is. Thankfully, I can handle the heat, but others may not be as fortunate. So as a tip, I'd say if you only like a little bit of heat, order it mild. The fact that the chicken was essentially shredded was a little odd, but it didn't affect the flavour at all, obviously. It was just strange, as I've never had curry with shredded chicken... I'd say make the heat level a little more True to form, and throw a few more peanuts in, and it'll be truly amazing!  The Thai pudding and sticky rice was REALLY good. It was warm, the perfect texture, and tasted like home.   As far as delivery goes, they had my order ready within a few minutes of ordering, which was great!   If not for the excessive heat on a medium hot order, and the prices being a tad high, I'd have given the place 4 stars. I'll totally order from here again, and may even go check out the actual restaurant on an evening I'm not feeling lazy. :)",

And for the New Year they've raised their prices again?  Too much. For this, for boiled, leather chicken, I'm gone.  What's the Woody Allen joke-\"the food here is horrible...and such small portions!\"  So last night I went to a new Thai restaurant, Thai Lotus, 19th Ave and Glendale and it was delicious.

I ordered the red curry chicken regular hot.  It was good, although not great.  The spice level was spot-on.  It was nice and creamy, although I would have like it a tad sweeter and a tad saltier.  The rice was perfectly sticky without being too starchy.  All-in-all, I would definitely give them another try since I have found Thai curry at many places can be a bit fickle--excellent one time and then so-so on a different occasion.",

The fact that they delivered and were on time remained almost the only good thing.   I ordered crab rangoons ($6.95), spring rolls ($2.95), and Pad Thai with seafood ($12.95).   The crab rangoons were fine. The balance of dough to filling was good. They were a little too greasy though. The spring roll was a little too greasy as well.   The Pad Thai, on the other hand, was terrible. Not only did it not have a nice, spicy (I requested medium) flavor I expect, but the overwhelming smell and taste of bad seafood made it inedible. I took out the seafood to try just the noodles, and still couldn't eat it. More tomato flavor than what I expect, but all was overshadowed by the bad seafood taste.",

Let me start by saying that I have been here many times, always because it's where my friends choose to come. Personally I wouldn't go back if it were up to me.   Service is great, the owners and staff are very sweet and take very good care of their customers. They are trying to make it work in an old IHOP building. They haven't changed it at all, but it's clean. The parking lot however is a total disaster...Reminds me of the Tenderloin in San Francisco! The light rail construction has also hurt them I'm sure.    Food though is very hit or miss. I have been a little disappointed the last three visits. Many appetizers seem to be store bought instead of homemade. The entrees are decent but I have high expectations after spending months in Thailand over the past couple of years. Some things are just lacking flavor. Other things are good. Like I said, it's more about the consistency.   To be fair here are a few things that have been good there...Thai toast (one of the few that are homemade), beef noodle soup, beef salad and Thai iced tea!   I wish them the best, this place just isn't for me.",

As Pad Thai dishes go, this one is pretty damn good, and my husband loves that it comes with chicken *and* shrimp, which they will happily change to *just chicken* for me. Medium spicy is usually hotter than medium but I like it that way. Try their crab rangoons (very crispy and very full) which come with sweet and sour, and my husband loves the coconut shrimp appetizer. The shrimp app is not a huge portion for the price, but the hubby must think it's worth it for how often we add it to our order!",

I have had a handful of dishes, but my favorite is the Chicken Panang Curry. I like mine mild but I have also had it medium and the heat is still doable. The Chicken Pad Thai is also delicious. My kids like the Orange Chicken but I am not a fan. The rice can be hit or miss...sometimes it's perfect, other times it's overcooked.  I have done take out, delivery, and eaten in. Delivery is usually fairly quick...I think only once it had taken the 45 minutes that I was quoted but I usually get it much faster. The food is always steaming, super hot when it's delivered. Take out is good..I usually only wait 10 min or so. I always receive friendly service. Definitely worth checking out.",

Coconut shrimp was ok--a little overly breaded--and I wouldn't go back for them. Then I had the Pad Thai. The shrimp had an odor and a really fishy taste so one bite of that was enough. The dish on the whole just didn't have much flavor and the noodles were all congealed so I actually had to cut it into bites.   If I had ordered this meal at the restaurant, I would not have sent it back, but I would not have wanted to go to the restaurant again. So since I was at home, I just didn't eat most of it...  I guess a little less than \"meh\" is my opinion.",

Presentation was lovely and spiced to perfection! Next time, we will order HOT because Medium was not quite hot enough for us. Our other favorite place was Thai Rama, but this is closer and just as good. The decor/interior is nicer here too. Try it out. I bet you'll like it. A friend told me that the Chicken Larb is terrific. I'll be trying that next time for sure. Come on neighbors, keep this place going through the construction period. I would hate to see it go.",

With my peanut allergy, I've been afraid to even try it, which makes my husband, who loves Thai food, very sad. He finally talked me into trying Thai Lotus and I am so glad I did.  We started with the fresh rolls and Thai coffee, very refreshing and tasty. I could have been content right there. For an entree, my husband had the Pad Thai, medium. He's been working on increasing his spice tolerance, and the heat was spot on. As for over-all flavor, he says it's best he's ever had. I had the garlic sauce beef. It looked deceptively simple, but the flavors were deep and very satisfying. We finished with the mango/sticky rice/coconut ice cream combo as suggested and it too was very tasty and a wonderfully refreshing summer dessert.  The atmosphere was laid back, the service incredibly friendly and I really appreciated the little visual touches, like the origami napkins, little curly design made out of our straw covers and the food presentation. They were happy to accommodate my allergy, and their huge menu was able to satisfy both myself (a heat wuss), and my braver husband. This place is well worth braving a little bit of light rail construction to get to, and we'll certainly be back.",

Hiring a carpet cleaner would be my only suggestion to improve the looks.  We were seated promptly by the friendliest little lady. We were very leery of the fact that this place was empty on a Sunday afternoon. The worthless Light-Rail is being pushed through 19th Ave and SEVERELY hinders access to the parking lot.  Anyhow, as for the food, IT WAS DELICIOUS!! And presentation was very nice. We each ordered something different in our party of three. We're not super familiar with Thai dishes, so all of the weird names were forgotten. As previously rated, the Thai iced-tea was very good -with an aftertaste of chai.  Since we were the only customers the whole visit, we were well taken care of by the hostess. She was very polite, prompt, but NOT hovering around us. We enjoyed this very much.  May not be the best Thai we've eaten, but if we want Thai without the drive, we will be coming back to Thai Lotus -especially to help support them during Light-Rail construction.",

I got a call the other day from a friend who had gone here for lunch and said it was great and that many of the employees had migrated from another Thai restaurant in the area that used to be great. Other old  favorites for Thai in Phoenix have gone downhill, so I was anxious to try this one.  It is a the old IHOP building on 19th avenue N of Glendale, and the decor hasn't changed much but they aren't officially opening for a couple more weeks. My sister and I ordered crab puffs, panang, and pad thai, and everything was AMAZING!   Our server was the best server I have had in a long time, she was very attentive and quick to fulfill our every request.  Please frequent this restaurant, if such a good business like this fails I will be very sad. Judging that they already had a fair amount of traffic, I am enthusiastic that they will succeed!",

The only suggestion I have is that they need to supply serving spoons and tongs(  they don't have any). Any restaurant who offers catering must have serving spoons. Fortunately for me, this office had some old ones in the kitchen that they saved from previous lunches.  Other than that, great experience.  I will definitely be ordering again soon.",

    "text": "Our first trip on the freeway northbound on I-17 through Phoenix, we were relieved to get off at the Glendale Avenue exit and only a few blocks away, with a left turn, the restaurant was right on the corner.  Aside from a careful navigation past the construction posts, we gingerly made our way into the parking lot as we watched the afternoon sun set further to the west.  It being about 2:45pm, it was a good time for a Thai iced tea to start.  Refreshing Thai iced tea, I was ready to order the main course, yellow curry vegetable and I decided to throw in some chicken pieces.  The curry came on with a punch, and when I was seen by the waitress watering it down with the water served at our table, she kindly took the plate back to the kitchen and remade the dish to be more mild.  It still had enough kick to be satisfying to my taste.  Upon entering, you're greeted by a Buddha and flowers as you leave your woes at the door.  The chef takes care to serve authenticated Thai entrees with just the right amount of spice and flavor.  Aside from what looks like might have been windows scrubbed to remove graffiti, the daylight comes into the windows and plenty a booth inside to help the guests sit more comfortably and promotes intimate chatter.  Not expensive, this restaurant is a very delicious find.  If you do drive here, sit where you can keep an eye on your car.  And whether your drive or walk, be mindful of racing bicyclists down the sidewalks that may be difficult to see (this didn't happen on our second visit here) when you approach the exit driveway as it crosses the sidewalk.",

After having the chef special Panang with Fish, I wish I had stopped in much sooner! It was served fairly quickly, with a medium spiciness as I'd ordered it. The peanuty curry sauce was delicious and creamy! The ambience was quiet and calm with soothing soft music, a nice escape from the light rail construction. I like that you can eat in groups, as a couple, or solo with their IHOP-style booths (it looks like an old IHOP inside, and there were a couple of leftover IHOP logos on their window coverings). There were plenty of chef specials to choose from; I hope to try the chef's Crisp Basil Tofu another time. There was a TV for viewing in one corner of the restaurant. It seems very family-friendly, with high chairs and booster seats for the kiddos. They've even got a few toys on hand in case the kids need them for a bit. :) Bathroom was clean with a baby changing station in it. The service was great, friendly and fast. I'm definitely coming back to try other Thai favorites, like their Green Curry!",

We have eaten there before and had delivery from this restaurant as well.  It's been pretty good until now.  Today I just ordered simple pad thai.  It was not 'mild' as ordered AND it was too tomatoey and not thai at all.  VERY disappointing.  The chicken used in the pad thai and the satay was also mushy, soggy and flavorless.  I think mine was even prefab chicken.  I think we won't be eating here again.",

    "text": "Super friendly staff, and excellent cooks.  Happy Hour has some really great deals . . . be sure to check it out.  Ordered Tom Kha (Coconut Soup) with Chicken, medium heat.  Just enough heat to not compete with the flavor, which is excellent.  The Galangal (Thai Ginger) in the soup is not recommended to be eaten by the Staff, but you can if you like.  We also did not eat the bamboo shoots as they were very fibrous, and I meant to ask about them too, but failed too as I was distracted by all the great food and Tsing Tao beer ( $3.50 HH ).  My buddy ordered the Red Curry with Chicken and it was sweet and delicious with jasmine rice cooked perfectly.  I ordered the Tilapia in Tamarind Sauce, Medium, but didn't really notice any heat.  That could of been because I was happily enjoying what a great fish this was!!  Super crispy skin, and tender tasty flesh. Do yourself a favor and use the plastic glove they give you and eat the fish with your hands.  The Staff was impressed I was \"eating it correctly\", LOL!  I will be going back again for this dish!!  Al that was left was a few fins and some bones.  I read some bad reviews, but I noticed mostly people who ordered delivery or were disappointed in the amount of meat in their order.  If you want more meat, order one of the dishes that focuses on the meats and not more of a mix.  Also, try eating outside your comfort zone and try some new dishes - at the restaurant.  Most Asian foods are far superior served fresh to your table.  Thai food is also traditionally eaten with a fork, so don't ask for chop sticks unless you actually prefer eating with them.  Good ambiance, clean and homey.  Remember, you are not paying for a high end dining experience, you should be there for the great food.  Clean bathrooms.  Can't wait to go back.  They have a great web-site with the full menu, including pictures, which I really appreciate.",

Their menu should've been my first clue that it wouldn't be authentic Thai since they have items like crab ragoons and orange chicken but it was weird because it's a family restaurant and they are clearly all Thai. Anyways, I ordered the crab ragoons just to see if there was something Thai about them and they came out cold with the cream cheese still frozen so when I told the waitress she took them away and brought them back out so I'm guessing they just dumped them back in the fryer for a few extra minutes. In the meantime, my pad Thai came out and it was as others have mentioned - very lacking in flavor. Instead of charging me off the lunch menu they charged me full price so all said and done it was $23 for very mediocre Thai food. There are so many great Thai restaurants in Phoenix so I can't say I'll be back to Thai Lotus.",

I ordered it as a Thai spicy and so the what was definitely there and it had good flavor. Price wasn't bad at all either, I think the total came out to $17ish with a Thai iced tea as well.   The second time I ordered a shrimp pad Thai, and it was just ok in my opinion. I've definitely had better but I'm not saying it sucked. Could have used a little more flavor to it and one thing I noticed was that it was a lot greasier than other pad Thai dishes I've had. This the only reason I took one star off.   I can't comment on service Bc all I did was pick up my food but everyone was super friendly in there. Prices are similar to what you would pay at Applebee's, maybe slightly less so that's fair.  Overall I'd come back for sure.",

They all had great flavor! I'm a light weight when it comes to spicy, but my friend can take it so we ordered the basil noodles medium spicy. I kept eating it because it tasted so good, but went through 30 oz of water or more. The pad Thai had great flavor (unlike other restaurants where I find it to be bland) but had maybe a tad bit too much vinegar.  I thoroughly enjoyed every dish but I think my favorite was the pumpkin curry.   We decided to try dessert and got the sweet sticky rice with mango and coconut milk. It was a great contrast of sweet cold mango and warm sticky rice! Definitely recommend as long as mangos are in season.   It was sad that the restaurant was pretty empty on a Friday night so I hope they survive light rail! The service was excellent and the staff very, very friendly.

I have ordered multiple dishes from here including the pad thai, tom kha soup, yellow curry, thai iced tea, and sticky rice with coconut ice cream. I have yet to be disappointed with this restaurant. I have not been to the actual location yet but definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for some great thai food in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Great find!   We live right around the corner and have been trying out new places. Based on good reviews, gave it a try. It is in a sketchy area and my husband didn't even want to go in but I made him. Lol.  We came on a Friday night around 7. When we came in it was virtually empty. Not a good sign. There were 1 or 2 others there. But we stayed. The whole place is booth seating like an old Denny's.   Our young server was friendly and got our drink order.  Then we ordered. I got hot jasmine tea and then Tom Kha? soup and my husband got Pad Thai.    Good thing we asked about spice levels. They only do 3 levels - low, medium, high.  The server told my husband that medium was \"perfect\" for her and not too spicy. He was about to do that and I convinced him to do low. Glad he did. His Pad Thai was still super spicy. I tried it and my mouth was burning and nose started running. The medium would have been way too hot!   But, it was SO good!  The flavors were great and fresh.  I got my soup with low spice too, and chicken with extra mushrooms. It was great too.   Only complaint would be service. After we got our entrees our server disappeared and never came back to check on us. We wanted some rice and to order dessert.  We finally got the rice and ordered the mango sticky rice for dessert. It was super yummy!   So excited to have a new go-to place for a Thai and go try some other dishes!",

We've had a conversation with the waitress and we were told that they make all their curry from scratch (no wonder it's so good and fresh). Also, I was really craving Thai iced tea beforehand, and that didn't disappoint either. :) The serving is huge, and it's definitely a shareable size. I posted a pic, but I didn't get to get a good one because the food got devoured right away!   We had kids with us, and they have some toys to entertain them. Definitely a family friendly place.",

I also began to dine here quite frequently after I moved closer to this restaurant. So I used to come here once a week for their happy hour which is absolutely a great deal. Two appetizers for 10 dollars and discounted alcohol.  I usually would get the shrimp tempura and crab rangoons for my appetizers. However when I was not here for happy hour, I always ordered the crispy spring rolls.   As for entrees, I've had their curries and they are great. However my default order (that the waitresses happened to remember) was either pad thai or pad-see-ew with fish. I don't know what it is, but their pad thai and pad see ew is absolutely amazing. I know I could get other proteins, but for some reason, fish for me, is the perfect protein for these dishes. Overall if I lived a lot closer to this restaurant still, I know I would still be frequenting this restaurant.   Even though I am not all too close, I'll still definitely stop by whenever I get the chance.",

When we walked in & I asked if it was too late to order at 8:15pm I should have already known that it was. I specifically asked for the vegetable spring rolls and they replaced them in my order with some pork eggrolls. I was disgusted and enraged when I found that we were even charged the higher price for the pork product!!!

The tofu was fried on the outside for a nice, firm texture, and it was mixed in a spicy-sweet sauce with crispy fried basil leaves.

It was cat fish served with bamboo shoots and veggies. My order came and the lady was putting the plate down and she accidentally tilted and it almost spilled over me. Instead, I moved so it only spilled on parts of my arm. The lady apologized and felt bad for doing that. It wasn't a deal to me because the lady was nice.   I did not expect the fish to be tiny fried pieces. I expected it to be fresh fish that they just chop and add in some pieces. But it felt like something you would get from a frozen aisle to fry. The sauce was a bit salty.   The main reason I go to Thai places is for the Thai tea.",

Now: I had forgotten I had written a poor review of this place one night when I ordered delivery. I ordered a green curry and the spicy basil noodles with tofu. I was sadly disappointed again. The curry was thicker this time, thankfully, but lacked depth of flavor. I could taste no fish sauce in either dish, nor ginger. It was bland. I also asked for a medium spice and it was not spicy at all. The noodles were very greasy and I almost couldn't eat them. I actually opened my cupboard and added some shrimp paste and salt to my curry to spruce it up.  A lot of people love this restaurant, and for those that want American Thai, which is more muted in flavor and less spicy then go for it!  I would recommend Thai Basil, or Red Thai if you want a more authentic flavor with spice.",

I love basil but I really don't want to eat a ton of basil leaves on a stem. Like I pulled so much freaking basil out of that. Also the pumpkin in it was kind of gross, just like super mushy and a little grainy. I was disappointed because I was excited for the pumpkin.

To top it off, the potatoes and onions weren't even cooked. For dessert I ordered the sticky rice with mango, and the mango was amazing, but the sticky rice was just that- sticky.

    "text": "It was a rainy day but my wife and I were craving Thai - so we ordered delivery through Yelp (serviced by Grubhub). Got three entrees with the intention of leftovers - Silver Noodle Pad Thai, Roasted Duck Pineapple Curry, and House Fried Rice. We like spice, so ordered each one \"Hot\", which is the second level from the top.  The Pad Thai certainly came out hot - about as hot as I would have expected given our selection. Unfortunately, it had no other flavors - the only thing you could taste was spice. This option is supposed to come with shrimp and chicken - had two shrimp. The chicken was fine.  The curry was criminally underseasoned - no heat to it at all, no other spices either. The sweetness from the pineapple was interesting but couldn't make up for an overall bland dish. Duck ended up too chewy.  The fried rice also was way underseasoned. Given the dish I wouldn't have expected much heat to it (though there was the option to select it!) but it could have certainly used some more salt and some more umami.  All in all, not going to order from there again.",

    "text": "I first walked in and it was dead quiet, no customers. The decor was sparse, it stil looked like the former IHOP just different colors...I think, nothing noticably different. I stood there for about a minute waiting to be seated. Two ladies were talking nearby and another walked from the back and pointed me out. One of the women who had her back to me, turned and quickly got up. Apologizing profusly she grabbed a menu and seated me.  She offered water before I ordered, but I asked if they had Thai Iced Tea. She did and brought me a water and my Iced Tea. The Thai Iced Tea was very delicious, just ask for easy ice...so you can get more tea.  I was deciding on the Pumpkin Curry (as yelped here) and the Pineapple Shrimp Curry. Pumpkin was just a little too different so I went with Pineapple Shrimp Curry-Hot. It was good, it was nice and spicy - nose sniffling spicy, perfect! - The taste was there and I liked that they gave you a large bowl of rice with it. You can get noodles or jasmine rice for a dollar more if you desire.   After my food arrived and she gave me a few minutes, the waitress came over asking about the food and started talking with me about the Pumpkin Curry, she was really pushing it. Like she wanted to make it Thai Lotus' signature dish or something. She was also talking about how the construction isn't helping her business and to tell people if I like the food here. Just a bit too pushy for me, I had planned to Yelp about the visit anyway, but still...  PRO's -The dish was sooo filling and pretty good $12.95. Those little red and green chili's were just halved and gave it an extra kick! -Thai Iced Tea was delicious $4.00. -Service was good, she even came around with pieces of watermelon she was eating with her coworkers. \"I share, after you eat hot, this sweet.\" she explained.  CON's -The carrots and peas in the dish came out of can, FRESH would've made it perfect. -Thai Iced Tea came in a large wineglass type, but too much ice and not enough tea. -There was an ant crawling on the diveder. Not a little ant, but a LARGE-where the heck did that come from- ANT.  A roach would have totally grossed me out and ended my visit. But ants happen, it didn't bother me - just the crazy size of the thing. I pointed it out to the waitress and she quickly grabbed her boss and napkin to dispose of it. As this is closer to me house than my #1 Thai place, I'll be going here again. Maybe to try the Pumpkin Curry, but maybe sticking to the other curry's I'm familiar with.",

Green Curry: Watery, flavorless sauce that somehow tasted like burnt pepper.  Massaman Curry: First, the potatoes were so under-cooked that I couldn't stick a steel fork in them. Second, I ordered it \"Hot\" and it came sweet and without any spice heat (my 1 year old had no problem eating it). Third, the \"sauce\" was dry. In fact, it wasn't sauce at all; they didn't add enough liquid to make it a sauce.   This meal was so bad, my wife and I just threw it out and found something in the pantry. I wish I could give this place \"0\" stars because this deserves less than 1.",

The pad thai came a hard cold gelatinous mass of noodles that appeared to be a left over, not freshly made. It was totally inedible! The curry dish was just a few overly large chunks of chicken swimming in a  canned sauce. The best thing was the white rice.  Frozen thai entrees from the grocery store would certainly have been tastier--and cheaper.  At least the place looked clean and the employees were friendly.

It was pretty much inedible due to lack of flavor. I think I got more \"styrofoam\" taste from the take-out container than anything else. Bland was all we could come up with. Super disappointing. Wish we could get a refund because I'm fairly confident I could whip up a more robust pad Thai dish than what we were given. Maybe a bad night in the kitchen? But won't be trying again.",

The first time I visited this new restaurant in my neighborhood, i just wanted some thai tea and curry. To my welcomed surprise the thai tea was awesome! And the yellow curry was awesome as well.   On tonights visit I had takeout again this time going for the well reviewed pumpkin curry, and it was sooooooo good! Loved it!   The fresh rolls are awesome as well!   I recommend actually sitting in and dining at this restaurant, as I plan on my next visit.  The atmosphere is very nice, although new and still in process. This was formally a pancake house so with time , we will see it become a True thai house atmosphere of relaxed meals and long conversations amongst friends.   The good vibe and owner is what attracts me, as well the curry and spice.   So give it a try, you wont be disappointed. The light rail construction, seems to sway ya, but just go slow and pull in for a visit.",

From what used to be the IHOP North of Glendale on 19th Avenue, you will find a vast selection of Thai dishes. They have a little happy hour from 4-7 We started out with the pot stickers, and ended up fighting over the last one. Drinks are reasonably priced. The Entrees we ordered were fantastic. I got the Silver Noodles with the Seafood Combination. No shortage of seafood here, squid, scallops, shrimp, mussles, catfish. My companion got the AMAZING pumpkin curry recommended by Sari. She was one of the most gracious and informative owners we have ever met, and she took the time to explain the various condiments you can add to your dishes, as well as suggestions for the next time we come in. Service was great. Both dishes and the appetizer were made with a focus on fresh and an eye on keeping it as healthy as these dishes could be, without sacrificing flavor. We will be back.

We placed a rather large order, several aps, soups as well as entrees. Usually Thai food is based on its' freshness. This food was far from that goal. The papaya salad was limp and \"soggy,\" with no crunch at all. It looked and tasted half rotten. The soups were insipid at best and very oily. The seafood in the soup (Po taek) tasted a bit wrong and we stopped eating it after a few spoonsful. The fish cakes were dense, oily and tasted warmed over. The entrees were small, had no flavor and were beyond greasy and saturated with oil. The pad thai was dry and burnt. Some of the noodles were crispier than the papaya previously mentioned. The restaurant must have run out of mint, basil, galanga, ginger and any other spice on this evening. This is quite possible the worst Thai meal I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing. I will not return and warn all others who are considering Thai options in the Phoenix area. There are numerous establishments with higher standards, better quality and freshness of ingredients and better outcomes than Thai Lotus Restaurant.",

    "text": "I used Yelp eat24 to order food that I picked up. Let me just say- it was flawless. Picked what I wanted off the menu, set a time to be picked up, paid on the yelp app, and picked it up at that time. Perfect. Order was right, and totally ready for me when I got there. Now let's talk food. We got:  Chicken Pad Thai- delicious. Not too sweet, and plenty of chicken. We did get a rogue shrimp in ours, so if you have a shellfish allergy, be very specific. Chicken Pad Se Eu (sp?)- wonderful flavor, flat noodles were pretty broken. Might be better if ordering at the restraunt fresh, not letting it sit in take-out Yellow Curry with Chicken- really great! Not too oily, and tasted like it should! Chicken Panang- effing delicious. I'm usually a yellow curry girl through and through, but this might just take the cake. Flavor, texture, everything- sooooo good. The only warning I would make would be we got it medium spicy, and I thought my lips were going to fall off. But the flavor was still so delicious! We'll absolutely go again!",

The portion I wish could of been alot bigger but most lunch specials r usually not that big unless its ala cart. The customer service is fair,  music is coo, food came out pretty quik after ordering it, the restaurant itself is pretty coo could use a makeover a lil. But id come again cuz I hear the curry is good so that might be my next visit.  So 3 stars for now for portions being so lil only cuz I can eat lmoa! I haven't yet to find an asian restaurant in Phoenix that is hella bomb n give big portions.",

    "text": "Although this is in a sketchy neighborhood it had good reviews and was close to my hotel so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I ordered the Masaman Curry Chicken.  This is one of my favorite orders from Thai restaurants when I travel so I am comparing it to many other places.  I can't comment on the service as I ordered it to go but the staff was friendly and the interior looks well maintained.  My two main issues were that the curry was watery and thin and most of all the chicken was pre-cooked from a can.  I know this because I have used it in my cooking before and I recognized the taste and consistency.  This explained the overall bland taste.  If you are not using quality ingredients then you will have sub-par results.  Look, I don't expect a place like this to be a gourmet spot but at least cook your own chicken.  In the end, it wasn't awful and it filled me up but that is about the best that can be said.",

The noodles were mushy and falling apart and the beef was dry and flavorless.  I ordered pot stickers.  Generally, hard to mess up.  These tasted like a Sysco foods product that had been frozen too long.  The sauce that came with them had an odd barbecue flavor unlike any Thai sauce with which I'm familiar.  I also ordered crab puffs, not because I wanted them but because there was a $25 minimum order for delivery.  They reminded me of what you would get at a very cheap Chinese restaurant.  I just threw away $40 worth of food (there was a $5.99 delivery fee).  I am not happy and am wondering how my experience could be so different from so many other yelpers...",

Tom Kha soup is our go to appetizer and we were not disappointed. Coconut milk, large shrimp, and just the right amount of spice.  I loved the crispy fish with a peanut and curry sauce. Excellently blended so my tongue got a little bit of each flavor. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her yellow curry. Did I mention the very friendly staff? Well I need to. They went out of their way to welcome us and actually smiled as if they enjoyed their jobs. Pretty hard to find that these days. What a great date night at our new favorite thai restaurant.

They serve cocktails and beer. One thing I noticed, the heat level is one notch lower than some other Thai restaurants.  I tried one entree at \"medium\", and it had a little bit of heat, but not as much as I expected. So now I order \"hot\". With some other Thai restaurants, if you order hot, your mouth will be on fire. But at Thai Lotus, hot has a nice pleasant burn and will make you sweat a little without getting absurdly hot. They also have extra hot, if you really like the heat. I've kept to ordering most of the classic dishes I'm familiar with, but they have a large menu with some unique items I haven't seen before. There are a lot of reasons to keep going back.",

    "text": "Clearly, this place used to be a Denny's, which immediately made me think that it would be awesome if there could be such a thing as a Thai Denny's.  I don't know if that's a really good idea, or a really bad one, but whatever.  I ordered the spicy basil noodle dish (often called Pad Kee Mao in most restaurants) and I asked for it to be extra spicy.  I suspect, but cannot prove, that the staff were placing bets on how much this white boy could eat.  I ate it all.  It was delicious.  My friend ordered the chicken basil, and it was a small portion, although it was still good.  An overall positive experience.  But seriously, get on that Thai Denny's idea, that needs to happen....",

The patron is super hospitable, engaging and kind.  Totally great with wheelchair access and service dog friendly! Delivery is always very nice and they work hard to time things so you get the freshest, hottest food possible.  So appreciate their work! Thank you ;)",

    "text": "The quality of food is not as good as other Thai restaurants in town and is more expensive than them too. Service was practically non existent. They only asked what we wanted and brought out the food. We ran out of our drinks and couldn't find ANYONE to ask for refills. Plus they took their sweet time to get us the check which was the only time we saw an employee after the food was brought out. The empty restaurant should have been a clue. Do yourself a favor and pick some place else.",

They played soothing music that made me want to get a massage. The reason for the four rating and not five is due to following:  After getting our food we were not acknowledged nor were our drinks filled. They past by several times and we tried to grab their attention and they kept walking by. After finishing our food they did not come to our table for about 15 minutes.   Other than that everything was good jus lacking on the service side.",
