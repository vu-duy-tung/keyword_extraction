However they have no decaf coffee options even for an Americano which sucks for me because I can't drink caffeinated coffee, so that is the only reason I took a star off and it would've only been a half star if that was possible. Service was great and friendly and the place is small and quaint.",

Be sure to try the Sunday brunch! The Benedict Arnold will have you craving more.  Today I tried the Tsoft serve and it is just as delicious as I imagined it. Their donuts, cupcakes, and cake are the best vegan treats I have had...and I have tried my fair share of vegan desserts!  Great job, Nami. Now all you need to do is open a location in SD.",

    "text": "In my searching of vegan options in Phoenix I stumbled across Nami that was listed as a 100% vegan ice cream shop/bakery/coffee shop.  Further search brought up photos of indulgent ice cream sundaes called tSoynamis.  We had the perfect opportunity to check out Nami following my birthday dinner at Pizza Heaven Bistro, since it was just up the street.  Not only does is Nami 100% vegan but they also carry many gluten-free options for those interested. Nami is located just next door to it's restaurant counterpart, Green.  The staff was super friendly.  Given so many choices they also gave us a hand selecting our tSoynami.  My husband went with the \"Mash\" which is a mash up of baked goods and other yummy additions of the maker's choice.   In other words a \"Mash\" will never be the same.  He was quite impressed by the tastiness of his treat and I will admit I stole many spoonfuls of his.  I chose the \"Fluffernutterin'\" which contained organic peanut butter, banana, ricemellow fluff and toasted marshmallow flavor.  Definitely a win in my book.  What made our experience even better?  When I saw that our treats were served in a biodegradable 16oz cup along with a wooden biodegradable spoon.  I'm all about reducing my carbon footprint.  Checking out their Facebook page I see that they have Hot Fudge Sundays and Sunday Brunch, both of which I know I will have to check out.  Not to mention, I definitely need to try some of their vegan baked goods ASAP. Vegan donuts exist too!!  The good and bad is that it's a pretty big trek to Nami for us.  Good since I think I'd be there every day.  Bad, that I wish it wasn't that far.  Even so I've  visited Nami 4 times since arriving in Phoenix just under a month ago -_-.  My excuses are that once it was my birthday and the other 3 I just happened to be in the area while exploring all Phoenix has to offer.  Hey, I had to take advantage of my opportunities.  Yes, vegan soft serve ice cream exists and it truly is heavenly.",

And you don't feel as weighed down/guilty after finishing a Soynami as you do when you polish of a DQ Blizzard.  The first time I went I had the Almond Oy Vey!, which was good, but not amazing.   Then a friend recommended the Coffee Coco Loco with the addition of Peanut Butter, and it's so good that I can't bring myself to try anything else. If you remotely like coffee and/or PB you will love it! I've never tried any of the baked goods, but I did bring home a chocolate cupcake for my boyfriend one night. He said it was really good (evidenced by the fact that I wasn't offered a bite), but the icing was overly sweet.   I shouldn't have written this review... now I'm really craving some Nami!",

Had a coffee and the donuts (vegan ones at that) and the fiance ordered some chocolate cookie.  Actually for something very simply prepared the taste was really good.  The coffee tasted spot on with a good balance of bitterness and smoothness (put 2 sugars and just a splash of what I assume was cream)  So if your vegetarian or want a dessert that doesn't overload you with processed sugars, hydrogenated oils and other crap that is in most bulk desserts, check this place out.",

It's basically a vegan version of a mcflurry for those who were allowed to eat those as a kid....but way better. It's vegan soft serve with mashed up chocosticks, chocolate chips and some sort of toffee syrup.   Also delicious is their \"yanky-doodle\" cookie. It's two chewy soft perfect snickerdoodle cookies with some sort of sweet vegan cream between like a cream sandwich. Holy yum.   Their donuts are a bit cake like and not really donutty like the gf donuts at Jewel's bakery. But this should not stop you because hey, cake rocks too!   Other notables... A mint latte drink, vegan chocolate shake (not too sweet and really great), cupcakes etc.  There is seating but it's not very comfy cozy...a bit more on the modern industrial meets cement and wood. You'll get over it though as you delight in sugar.  All in all, this place should definitely be a part of your life.",

I also tried their soy ice cream with animal crackers mixed in. It's icier than regular ice cream, but letting it melt a bit helps.

The added ingredients were plentiful and I had cookie pieces and chocolate syrup in every bite. The wooden spoons wigged us out a little, but we worked through it.  After sitting in Nami eating our Tsoynamis, we couldn't resist getting a few items to go. My husband was excited to find Ethiopian whole coffee beans at a great price ($10). I got a Nami cake--a chocolate cupcake reminiscent of the traditional Hostess variety with white cream filling and chocolate frosting. My first vegan cupcake and such a great one to start with. We also got a delicious looking oatmeal cream pie cookie that was equally delicious. There were so many cupcakes and delicious baked goods to choose from, it was hard to decide.

Highly disappointed, much rather would've spent less money for an extra 50 calories!!!!",

We have been frequenting this place for Sunday brunch and working our way to sample the entire menu. My absolute fave is the sage sausage  hash as you can't even tell it's vegan and it is perfectly seasoned. Make sure you save room for the tsoynami. I am the biggest froyo fan but this tsoynami goodness has totally turned my world of icy food upside down. It's honestly the best frozen dessert I've had although I really have to slow down cause as healthy as it is being tofu/soy based all that extra sugar from all the toppings do not make it easier on this hip and I will still end up looking like a vegan fat whale.",

All of my experiences have been nothing short of amazing.  I have eaten at Nami for breakfast, desert after lunch, desert after dinner and for a mid-day snacks.  The coffee is all vegan and fair trade and they offer all kinds of milks to add in with your lattes and such.  Packaging for the coffee is also awesome.  For breakfast, you can opt for some power vegan bars sitting on the counter, quiche or search through the sweets display case.  For deserts, my favorite is the cupcake which was inspired with the Hostess cake but it's vegan!  That's right... chocolaty-goodness with white cream filing and icing on top! oh my!  They also have a chai cupcake which has a cinnamon-like icing on top... yum yum!  They have snicker doodles with icing sandwiched in between and mini-cookies to scarf down.  Everything is vegan!  They are famous for something known as a soy-nami but I've never made it to the vegan ice cream!  I'm always opting for the aforementioned sweets!  If I ever get to one, I will review again... They also do sundaes and live music on Sunday nights.  For dinner, walk across the parking lot to Green Pastures.  See my review for this restaurant as well.",

    "text": "Well, it's always my goal to try something different and that's definitely what Nami was! My boyfriend & I are by no means vegan, however we were in the area and he found this place under desserts on Yelp. We figured we'd stop in to give it a try. Was it good? .. By vegan standards, I think so? Would we return? Debatable.  The biggest problem we had at this place was that we didn't really understand what the menu items were. After a look over their offerings, I wanted just plain soft-serve, so I picked vanilla. Or more like \"vanilla\" I suppose. More than anything, it tasted super coconut-y. I'm not a fan of the coconut flavoring taste so that was disappointing as was the texture. It was almost just icy and not at all soft like what I'm used to. I did get used to it after a few bites but it almost felt like my teeth were hurting because the dessert was so cold!  My boyfriend was actually looking for a pastry and though the betterfinger would be tasty. A tsoy-nami is definitely not a pasty. It's more like what a concrete is from DQ for the non-vegan folk. I probably would have been better off ordering that since it actually had toppings to mask the flavor of the vanilla soft-serve. He also wasn't a fan of coconut taste but said that he didn't care for the texture more than anything else.  Like previously mentioned, I think by vegan standards, it was alright. Overpriced, however I've never had vegan ice-cream before. I suppose if I couldn't have regular milk, I'd probably come here to get a soy-based treat. The best part was that after eating my whole cup of soft-serve, I didn't feel like I had a sugar overload.  The staff was friendly but not very helpful. We saw a couple of customers there who seemed really annoyed, I'm guessing because they had to wait a while to get everything they had ordered. We didn't have to wait too long to get our order.  If you're in the area, check this place out. I'm interested in trying the vegan restaurant Green, which is right next to it.",

We are frequent visitors (about once a week, usually Sunday brunch) and every visit has been memorable. We have ordered the biscuits and gravy, the big ol burrito, the donuts, the cupcakes, the Benedict as a burrito, and the Rodney Dangerfield. Even with a line out the door service is fast, and friendly!   The restaurant itself is small and intimate. They have indoor and outdoor seating and during brunch seat next door at Green.   The pastry case is always full of delicious, colorful, and (of course) always vegan treats. You won't be able to help yourself but to order one (or 5).  The donuts are dense and sweet and always come in creative flavors that put any other donut (vegan or not) to shame.   You DO NOT HAVE TO BE VEGAN to eat here. I promise that the food you enjoy at Nami is tastier and better for you and your environment than you can get at any other restaurant.",

Great list of choices for what you liked. And they are perfect size. Not too small and not too big. Last time i was at Nami they cost $5. But ive been told the price went up a little.  Ive looked and i cannot find any place here in Portland similar to Nami. I even got my meat eating, cow dairy loving friends hooked on the Tsoynami's. They would all finish the whole Tsoynami. Nothing left in the cup. (Lol) thats how darn good they are. And some times would go for a second one.  Great average sized seating area inside and patio seating out front or in the back. We never got over there for breakfast but its some thing i wished i did. I usually went to Nami in the afternoon or at night. If you ever think of branching out. Please come to Oregon Portland to be specific.",

It was very delicious by the way, the pancakes was amazing. It had brought to my attention why my nephew and I had to share the syrup bottle, instead of having our own. Which we usually do. It was never a problem before. Then my girlfriend and her fiance showed up, ordered the same thing, and their plate looked better than mine. Not only that they had their own syrup, she had two pancakes and more items on her plate than I did.   I never complain,  i love this place. I talk about this place all the time, tell them to come here allll the time. its not a huge deal, but it was bothering me. Its not like I was going to eat the whole pancake, but it was the portion control that I didn't get. Why should mine be any different? shrugs.. nami is starting to get well known, busier and probably just half ass everything just to get the customer going and what not.",

I rather create my own meal of sides rather than an entree. As a vegetarian, I went between here and Green next door my whole Phoenix stay.   The only thing that stuck out to me was when I ordered a pour over, before I even finished paying I received it. What? One of the main aspects of a pour over is that it's brewed fresh for you, cup by cup. Instead, I got coffee that was already made from a vat or percolator. It tasted rather watery and flavorless. More akin to diner coffee. Okay, maybe the pour over was pre-made and poured cup by cup into a giant vat. Who knows? That is more time consuming than what it's worth. Just sell drip coffee and call it drip coffee and charge less.",

I'm not a vegan so I was a little skeptical of the tofu egg, \"bacon\" and \"cheese\", but it was absolutely delicious! There is also a sauce that is a little spicy which completes this sandwich. I also love that they use real matcha as many places don't and I can get  it unsweetened, which a lot of people think is crazy.  The only downfall is the cost. It's $16.83 for a breakfast sandwich and latte. To me, that's a bit expensive. This is a place I'll come back to splurge every now and again, though. The food and I cannot forget the service is that good!  Highly recommend!",

Despite my husband not being a big lover of vegan food, we both absolutely love anything we've tried on their ever-rotating menu! Most recently, we placed a catering order with Nami to have some of their world class donuts be delivered as a late night snack for our wedding guests. The order arrived exactly as described, and our guests (most of which are not vegan) raved about how fresh and tasty the donuts were, not to mention how beautifully decorated they looked! I am so glad we went with Nami for our special wedding day dessert, and can't recommend this restaurant enough, whether it be for a quick casual bite or a large catering order!",

Their vegan soft serve has always been incredible and you can get it at both of the Green restaurants, but what I love about Nami is that they have A LOT of different baked goods and beverages! I no longer live in Arizona, so when I visit family, I always have to stop by to purchase a box of treats. Their Yankee Doodles are amazing, as well as everything else I've ever had there. The parking is atrocious and you're better off parking elsewhere and just walking to the restaurant if you plan on sitting and not just sending someone in the pick something up for you.",

Got home and WOW! I will be getting this cake again, it was moist, chocolatey, and delicious. I'd love to bring some friends/family here that think Vegan things always taste weird because they'd never imagine how good it can be. Looking forward to coming back to Nami and trying out some of their specialty drinks and other snacks. Parking lot was pretty busy and tight but we managed to find a little spot. Just be patient, it's worth coming in. Been back a few more times & their donuts are Amazing! Also I LOVE their S'mores Tsoynami, wow!!!

I pulled onto the parking lot and was directed by an employee that the blue building is not Nami, but the one next door. Helpful as the two share a parking lot.  The inside of Nami is quaint with retro fruniture and art mixed in with little cacti in the windowsills and proud displays that they are open to all.  The menu stretches across the wall and features assorted coffee drinks, pastries and a lovely hot breakfast menu. From what I could tell, all of the items are organic.  I ordered a samoan but received a samoan bar instead of samoan donut instead. This was quickly remedied by the friendly cashier. The hot chocolate was also delightful with almond milk, my favorite.  They also had a small offering of other items such as boxed crackers, cookies, candy, etc.  Their restroom out back was decorated in a modern style.  The prices are comparable to the chain coffee shops and I would much rather shop local!",

    "text": "On the same night my friend and I went to Green, we stopped here to get some vegan sweets.  We decided on cookies.  I think she ordered a snickerdoodle, and I ordered a chocolate chip cookie.  The cookies were good; however, it took a bit of time for us to get them.  They were right in the case, and I'd say we waited a good 10 minutes or so, and not sure why it took that long for us to receive them.  On my last day in Phoenix, we returned here to each try a tSoynami treat.  She had the banana cream pie flavor, and I ordered the PB and chocolate, and we were both LOVING our treats!  Very yummy and excellent to cool you down on a hot Arizona day!  Will also be back on my next trip.",

It's not uncommon for vegetarians and vegans alike to struggle to find quality meals outside of their own kitchen that satisfy nutritional need as well as great taste - at Nami and Green's you won't have that problem. On Sundays, enjoy a brunch by Nami and seating in Greens - bring your non-vegetarian friends and enjoy a meal that's appropriate and delicious for everyone. Get there early however - parking is competitive!",

    "text": "Last time coming to Nami- the 10 minute drive was not worth it and here is why..... It's vegan great but its mostly processed, high sugar, and over priced compared to competitors. I stopped going to green vegetarian a long time ago. But now Nami is on the list. I would go in here occasionally for a yogurt parfait. Now it's 1/2 the quantity and for the same price. Oh and for a TBS of extra granola they charge $2. Yeah I'm done. This has been the consensus among the people I know that used to go here also... it's all processed high sugar appeasing but yeah not worth it. It's not a conscious vegan places based on nutrient dense plant based foods that can be delicious when sweetened properly. Nevertheless I kept coming for that 1 thing which would be a cookie, drink, etc here and there. Well that's it for me. I applaud the idea but update your business marketing and retention provisions to keeping customers and you will keep booming. Don't......  well continue to loose an existing customer base- which btw is extremely important long term . That's just the business of the restaurants.",

I tried the breakfast burrito with the veggie nuggets, tsoynami cookie dough and the veggie eggs Benedict. These aren't your traditional dishes as they are replaced with tofu and no meat, but boy were they amazing. The burrito was perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of cumin. The tofu looked just like eggs. The tsoynami was probably the best soft serve, thought it melts pretty easily I love how it has the texture of soft serve but not the overwhelming taste of milk. I would definitely recommend this place",

It's trendy more than quality, the desserts are pretty decent but sickly sweet and a bit steep on the pricing. The \"coffee\" is a whole different story, it's NOT coffee at all, it's a bunch of sugar, syrup and cinnamon/nutmeg. I'd rather support small coffee shops and bakeries with quality products and pricing in sunnyslope than this garbage. I assume the people drinking \"coffee\" here have no clue what real coffee tastes like.",

I had the Coffee Coco Loco tsoynami, which came with chocolate, coffee, and little pieces of crispy rice. My friend had the Almond Oy Vey, which came with coconut flakes, chocolate syrup, and almond silvers. Keep in mind that both of these \"ice cream\" were gluten free and dairy free, and it was amazing how good it tasted! The tsoynamis were a bit lighter and icier than their traditional heavier icecream counterparts, but I liked it better the tsoynami way.   Nami also has quiche, pastries, shakes, yogurt parfaits, gluten free donuts, as well as vegan donuts and brunch on select days.   Will be definitely going back to try their gluten free donuts and their parfaits before work, and definitely will be back for some tsoynami treats - I'll post pictures! In a happy food coma right now... Highly recommended.",

It's also right next to Phoenix Green which is an awesome Vegetarian/ vegan based restaurant! Good food but that's a different review for another day! Nami also serves as a coffee shop, so get specialty coffee lovely vegan pastries at your service. What they are mostly known for is their yummy donuts and they have an awesome brunch that they do on Sunday's which is superb. But when you go, definitely is try one of their signature tsyonami which is a yogurt based soft serve made with coconut / soy products so all vegan safe! From the cute small interior that's filled with local artists art, and cute little succulents. Nami is a way to go or at least try out, it surely won't disappoint!

I had the Doughboy (vanilla soft serve, chocolate sauce, and cookie dough) and my companion had the Donatello (vanilla soft serve, caramel, chocolate sauce, chocolate chips, and pecans). These were like I remember Blizzards being! Soooo good. I haven't had anything like it since I became vegan 11 years ago.

Also nice, they have restrooms right outside by the entrance! I've tried the doughboy tsoynami and also the PB 'n' Chocolate and they are both delicious! The prices aren't too high but you do get what you pay for! I haven't tried anything else on the menu but everything looks delicious here! I definitely will be returning back in the future!",

When I asked what they use in the lemon bars the response was \"I have no idea\". I came in again with my friend, and we both ordered tsoynami. They made his first, then a bunch of other people- nearly 19 minutes later mine was ready. My friend tried to wait to eat his, but it was melting. So, by the time I had mine- I was eating alone. It really didn't make sense.   Conclusion- a vegan restaurant should really know what's in the food. Many people adopt this lifestyle because of food allergies and various other concerns. Improve workflow and service. Right now you are below standard, but you have the potential to be great.",

    "text": "I hit up Nami twice while in Arizona - once for a famed tsoynami (a vegan twist on a Dairy Queen blizzard), second time for breakfast.  It's such a great gem in the desert, and I love that it's right by where my only friend in the area lives, haha.  The second I started crossing through Phoenix (after 7 hours on the road!), I found my way to Nami to get a cookies and cream tsoynami.  It's a cute little bungalow with way more parking than I anticipated - except this place is popular so it's still not enough, haha.  Everyone working there is so sweet and upbeat, you can't help but be in a good mood, too.  I got my treat and headed to my final destination in Scottsdale.  I found the vanilla soft serve base really disappointing.  It was really icy and melted almost instantly.  It's not the creamy, thick base of blizzards or McFlurries I remember at all.  But it was cold, and I was hot, at the cookie bits throughout were perfect.  I was determined to give them another try on my way out of Phoenix, to grab breakfast before my journey home.  This time, I went with a caramel \"mockiato\" and a McBagel Sandwich.  10 outta 10, on both counts!  The mockiato was a dead ringer for my former favorite at Starbucks, with a little whipped cream and everything!  I'll be real, my sweet tooth has subsided these past few years (maybe thanks to veganism?!), but this was such a treat and the perfect trip down memory lane.  I also looooooved the McBagel Sandwich.  I've got a soft spot for breakfast sandwiches and this was one of the best I've had.  Fried eggy tofu, veg ham, cheddar daiya (I think?),  and spicy aioli on a bagel tasted like something out of my LA favorite, locali, except fully loaded.  I headed on the road to California right after, and didn't need to stop for food the whole way.  That's impressive!  I'd definitely come back here when I'm in the area!  They have so many vegan goodies, that even if the tsoynamis don't impress me, I will not leave empty handed (uhhh s'mores bars and twinkies, anybody?).",

    "text": "For over a year now I have oogled over pictures of food from Nami and today I went and tried my first tSoynami. My expectations were definitely met! I have been trying to stay away from dairy lately, but sometimes vegan treats just aren't that good. Not the case at Nami! The location was easy to find, but parking was horrible. I think I parked illegally and almost hit a wall and a few cars trying to get in and out of a spot. But that is my only complaint! The place is smaller than I had anticipated, but it was cute! Not too crowded, but there was a steady flow of people. I liked both the interior and exterior of the restaurant. At first I was worried because the tsoynamis weren't written on the chalk board, but then I thankfully found a menu. There were so many options! A lot of gluten free choices as well which is so great. I certainly had trouble choosing. Also they had some ready made treats on display which looked tasty. Some kind of coconut donut, yum! After much deliberation, I settled on the Haystack Attack. I got half chocolate half vanilla. It came with chocolate, gluten free pretzels, rice marshmallow, and a rice cereal. It was very very tasty! Very sweet and I couldn't finish it, but I loved it and would totally come back to try something new. Also now I'm looking at the Sunday brunch pictures and I'm drooling over them. Another positive, the people working there were nice, didn't seem pretentious, which sometimes people who work at places like that kind of are ha. Very awesome, I recommend!",

It is more watery than ice cream made with cow milk when it melts. But it wasn't full of ice crystals like a granita. It still has a great smooth texture.   I had the banana cream pie tsoynami. It had bananas, banana syrup, whipped cream and vanilla cookies. I wish I had a second cup of just the vanilla cookies. It was exactly what I was craving that I didn't even know until I put it in my mouth.   Who knew healthyish stuff could taste so good?  At this point, I'll just pretend like it's all fat free so I can try everything. I can't wait to go back.   The only caveat? The parking lot is small & was packed even during what was supposedly their \"slow time\". So, carpool or walk or ride a bike maybe? But don't miss out on this awesome place.",

It included peach cobbler, house made granola, and caramel. I was skeptical about the soy flavor but there was no weird aftertaste.   We arrived in the afternoon so sadly there were no more donuts left. The cashier informed us that the donuts go out really fast in the morning! Really friendly staff and comfy cozy atmosphere inside despite its small size.",

There was a large group of us there for breakfast so we had the chance to try several different things.  Friends loved their biscuits and gravy and I liked my breakfast burrito, although next time I'll probably skip the melty vegan cheese.  Everything is vegan and they have gluten free options on top of that so I'll definitely be taking some family there when they come to visit (multiple allergies/food sensitivities).  Their donuts were light and fluffy, unlike other vegan pastries I've had.  Can't wait to come back to try some of their other desserts and coffee drinks.  The best surprise was the pitaya bowl.  The puree is so light and refreshing and goes well with the granola and fruit on top.  It was even better than the acai bowl another friend tried.  I don't know that I would go for any savory items again if I didn't have any vegans with me, but I'll definitely be back for coffee, dessert and pastries and probably the pitaya bowl!  We're also sad we missed the special brunch.  I guess they only serve that on certain days.  I would have liked to try their pancakes and French toast.",

Unfortunately today was not a good experience. We ordered two coffees and two doughnuts, simple order. I waited forever to get my order. Everyone behind me in line that ordered, got theirs and left. I noticed they made all the Tsoynamis all at once, no matter what time you ordered them. Leaving all the simple orders at the end, even though I was first to order. I had to ask if they forgot me, since I was the last man standing. They said no, we're making your drinks now. They asked if I already got my pastries, I told them that I haven't received anything from them and I waited the longest. Not one sorry...no apologies, nada. Where has the customer service gone.... As business owners I understand that you're only as good as your product and especially customer service. Unfortunately they failed in customer service today. I believe their system is flawed, hopefully they're having an off day. One customer told me that this was the longest wait he's ever experienced and he had just ordered a simple plain iced coffee, he got his order right before mine, after he had to remind them of it. Was going to give them 2 stars for today's experience, but thought that may be a bit harsh.",

These tSoynamis are similar to a blizzard in the sense that it is a soft serve type ice cream with mix ins...that's when comparisons end though.  The ice cream here is vegan although the texture isn't quite as soft as traditional soft serve it's still pretty smooth on the whole.  The baked goods are also quite delicious and quite massive.  The prices are a little on the high side though and would add up quickly if one came here all the time for a coffee or dessert. Still need to try the brunch.",

I came here for the Tsoynami (a vegan friendly dq blizzard) and was not dissapointed. While I don't think you can ever really compare apples to apples when it comes to dairy desserts and non dairy alternatives, it's about as close as you will find. (I wonder if they have one with apples? probably not). I don't think I will ever really find a replacement for my froyo love.  I can't attest for how healthy they are; I imagine the fat content is fairly low, since it is soy based. For those carb / sugar conscious - the ingredients info isn't really posted anywhere, but I imagine there is a fair amount of sugar in whatever toppings, cookies, and candies that go into your frozen dessert. Just do a couple extra sit-ups, it's worth it!",

    "text": "I'm a fan of cool, hip coffee places and to find a place like this in PHX was gravy!   After finishing up a road trip vacay of the four corners states, a much needed iced cold coffee back home to Los Angeles would be nice. Especially when your in this Arizona desert heat Nami can't go wrong and thanks to my trusted Yelp search this place made me feel like hipster home.  Parking can be tight here and we ended up parking at the rear. There is a rear entrance way to get inside if you are parking from the backside of the shop. Why I like hipster joints like these? its because many offer different types of coffee in their special menu, not just ordinary and I like the cool savvy ambiance.   It was on a sunday here close to brunch time it was packed here, and hell no we are not getting out this line! Patience is worthy here trust me. Looking at their menu on the wall they do have an impressive variety from deserts, hot coffee or cold but most of all its Vegan powered here!   We ordered the Caramel Mochaito and the Cactus Haboob ( not sure if its spelled exactly right )  but their specials had names like \"the Mash\" among others. Im not sure what our iced coffees had in them but the name says it all and what really matters is the taste. Our drinks were $5.00 each. which is cool, you gotta remember VEGAN.  The staff here are pros because we didn't wait too long for our orders and the place was busy. After taking a few sips of our drinks, it wasn't overly sweet with any sugar rush or any of that coffee bitterness, all I can say is that both our drinks tasted smooth especially the Caramel Moch. I had was silk as Dove chocolate and the Cactus Haboob was cool and refreshing like Freddy Flintstone's Cactus Coola.  Checkout their other desserts here they look eye candy and promising. I highly recommend coming to Nami and to do away the Starbucks! Think Vegan!",

    "text": "It takes a great deal to push me to review an establishment, good or otherwise and I have written few.  Whenever I'm in town, Green has been my standby for a couple of years now for its vegan selections, and this time around I took my family to Nami for the first time. For starters, my tea had finally come out with no almond milk. Easy fix. Didn't think anything of it. Brunch is a busy time for them and can understand that there are many chances for mistakes, however we noticed after a while that guests who ordered well after us were finishing their meals. We followed up and got an apology and we were fine with the explanation of their miscommunication within the kitchen. So to pass the time, I had ordered a mimosa from green and asked for different juice option. ($7 for a less than an 8oz mason jar). The lady misunderstood my order that I had already paid for and when I saw her finishing the pour of oj, I tried to explain that wasn't what I meant at all. Her reply \"I already poured it.\" No matter that I already paid for it tho, right? She served the mimosa with a side cup and I asked her what that was for. She explained that the cup was for the juice order. Clearly another mix up and she refunded me for the juice. 20 min later, our food had finally arrived. I asked for the chiliquiles with no potatoes and it showed up loaded with potatoes. I pointed it out to our server, again, very apologetic and willing to correct it and add more scramble in place of. No problem there, except it came back with potatoes on it still. I had then asked to make a new one since their idea of a remedy was to simply remove the potatoes, and our server agreed to my request. The order came back with a hair on the plate and my moms fruit also had a hair. That said and also after tipping generously at the time of order, I decided to ask for a manager from Green. As it happens the cashier who took my mimosa order was the manager. I took her aside away from the table to explain our experience had been unusually below par and that I am a loyal customer. Her response was one that lacked empathy and not even made any kind of act or offer of righting the wrongs of the experience. And at that point, i knew what I had to do. Thank you for reading and I hope others get better service/treatment than we did.   As for myself, my friends and family who I recommend, these two establishments has seen my last dime and now what was once a recommendation will now be a that of a warning.",

My husband, on the other hand, had a spoonful and stopped there. He was not a fan of the taste at all. We also got a chocolate and strawberry cupcakes. The chocolate one was really moist and actually tasted like chocolate. The strawberry one not so much. It tasted more like a bland muffin. Would not order that flavor again.   Again, if you are a fan of dairy-free already, you might actually really like this place. Worth a try.   Overall, the prices are pretty high. And I get it, it's a hip place and they can get away with charging $5 a cupcake but I don't think I can justify spending that much on a bland cupcake again.  Oh and parking is a nightmare so good luck there.",

I've ordered the tsoynami both times and highly recommend it! If I remember correctly I had the merry berry the last time which I loved. It had a oatmeal cookie mixed in and enjoyed every bite of it. Even to the fact that it tasted better than a normal oatmeal cookie or possibly the best oatmeal cookie I've ever had. Fellow elite Lorraine joined me and she had the monsoon which is a basically chocolate tsoynami and she loved every bite of it as well since she is a chocolate lover. Also if you have a lactose issue but still enjoy ice cream, this place is also for you. Since this is a vegan spot in dtphx, it is definitely hipster. I think all the patrons I've here have a sleeve tattoo, lol! The only bummer about Nami is the parking is awful, but I guess it is expected due to the area? Maybe you should use the Metro going here?

    "text": "Pleasantly surprising.  They serve Royal (@ the Market), for those interested.  Being pretty hip to the coffee scene in PHX, I was a little surprised to hear of this new shop, having not heard of it's coming.  Maybe I didn't look around enough, but it felt like Nami just kind of popped up.  So I had my doubts, as I always will when giving a new place a shot.  The layout was pleasant, and the decor pretty rad; love the couch.  Parking seems sorted out a great deal better than when That's A Wrap inhabited the area -  good plus there.  Sweets looked great.  So I order my typical - drip and a 2x (on the side).  This gives me a general idea of the shop; milk drinks are for second and beyond trips.  Firstly, their demi-tasses are super cute.  Obviously hand-made, and hopefully local.  Loved it.  My drip actually turned out to be a pour-over, which is a plus to me.  A coffee junkie can appreciate a pour-over, where it kind of scares a person just wanting some \"coffee\" (see: I understand why you call it drip vs pour-over).  Straight up espresso is generally a quick way of determining bad-average-good.  Crema was nice though, consistent, and had me thinking I might have a decent thing here.  Taste was good, creamy and quite chocolatey (which seems the profile of the beans being used - the drip was reminiscent of the same).  Said and done (from a 'snob' standpoint), the espresso was good, not mindblowing.  I think the grind was right, but either the dosing could be moved up a tiny bit, or tamped a little harder.  Granted, this was the first and only I had there, so I can't necessarily base the entire shop on that one dopio.  All in all, I'm saying it was good, and while the extraction time was right, it could use a little more density.  The drip (see: pour-over) clearly used the same roast, which isn't a complaint.  The same chocolatey, creamy notes were abound.  I feel the dosing was very light, and should have either been a 12oz, or more grounds used.  I actually felt I was drinking a water heavy coffee.  Not terrible, but certainly not great.  I have a sneaking suspicion if the measurement was a bit closer, it would have been a much better brew.  Pour-overs are an art first, for sure, then a science.  I think they have potential here.  Maybe a better pot would help with this brew method as well.  -- I'll be back.  My experience was neither mind-blowing nor off-putting.  I'm hoping after they get into the swing of things and get the kinks ironed out, this will be one of the cooler stops in PHX.  Certainly a great concept and whatnot.",

For $4.50, you can easily split it between two people. I usually like to eat my own so I can bask in my gluttonous glory. All of the baked goods are also excellent.

We had a cinnamon donut.  So fresh, and springy and delightful.  It has been one of the only things I have craved but had been unable to satisfy since transitioning to vegan.  But now, finally, a fabulous solution.    We also enjoyed the biscuits and gravy  and the mcbagel sandwich.  Both were extraordinary.  The B/G was huge.  Next time we will share.  Potatoes were cooked to a beautiful brown perfection.  The Tofu scramble is some of the best I have encountered but the star of the show, by far was the gravy.  Creamy and satisfying with large chunks of \"chorizo\".  The McBagel sandwich was also a thing of outstanding craftsmanship.  The bagel soft and delicious.  The tofu egg and veggie ham had perfect spice and flavoring.  I'm not sure how they make the \"cheese\" but it is AMAZING.  This little gem came with a side of fruit.  Boring and expected one may think.  However, this fruit was clearly freshly cut and perfectly ripe.  NO soft grapes, hard cantaloupe or honeydew here my friends.  This was beautiful, bite size chunks of granny smith apple, perfectly ripened strawberries and sweet pineapple.  My one complaint about NAMI.  I live in Mesa and it is in Phoenix.",

I was under the impression that their macchiato had a bit of caramel drizzled in it. WRONG! Tonight, I ordered a \"macchiato, 16oz please\" and was informed that it only comes in one size. Previously, more than once, I've ordered a 16 oz macchiato and I explained that to the gal tonight. She asked someone else there, who confirmed they only make it in one size. Ok, fine, I'll have the one size and please make two since I will want more than 12 oz. Then I stood there for 20 minutes, while they made every other customers' tsoynami's, even those who paid after me. I understand, they were busy, but it's just a coffee now.... The gal who rang me up, finally noticed me standing there and apologized, saying they would make my macchiato's right away. Which they did. I get back to work and take the lids off, and they aren't even filled up all the way. What the heck?! Upon sipping, it definitely is NOT the same thing I've received in the past when ordering JUST a macchiato. I never once have ordered it as a caramel macchiato, but I'm realizing now, that must have been what I was charged for, and what was made for me. Moral of my review... get it together guys. I love your products, and you are full of super nice employee's, but there needs to be a bit better communication between each of you, especially when busy, so that a coffee order isn't waiting for 20 minutes. And PLEASE instruct the sweet guy with longer brown hair and glasses, that when a customer orders a macchiato, it only comes in ONE size, and it's not the same thing as a caramel macchiato. ;-)",

The people that work there are really nice, and if you have a million questions about what kind of cinnamon they use in their cookies, they won't get mad and they'll actually answer. The only downside is the tiny parking lot for Nami+Green, but you can usually make do.",

Food looks great and is homemade which justifies the prices in this market space until more competitors come into, which I do not see happing soon. Staff is stressed and needs to take a breather and see how they can improve the customer service. That is the only negative with this place so be prepared for it. I hope they can adjust for their demand and improve getting everyone's order out in a timely manner and not just a few, along with a friendly attitude. Good luck to the staff take this as a constructive review. I wish you complete success, support your locals.",

    "text": "Very interesting place. Not at all what I was expecting. I had an iced mocha (geez was it vegan lol? Now I wonder!) which was pretty good. Only drawback was that there was a tiny layer of melted ice at the top which generally indicates the espresso was poured over the ice instead of the proper way of adding the ice last (which may or may not have happened since I wasn't watching it being made, just my observation after years of being a bit of a coffee snob). I also tried the winkie because it was too novel not to. It was... Hard to explain except although it bore no taste resemblance to its toxic namesake, I would definitely eat one again. Very enjoyable and baby loved it too.   I can't give 5 stars simply because I think there are tastier coffee places in town (and whose beans I always buy a crapton of so I can pull shots at home), BUT nevertheless this was a great spot and I'm glad I finally tried it. If you're a diehard vegan this would probably be your favorite coffee place.   Also - on a side note - they charge extra for whipped cream. Kinda weird. As a consumer, nickeling customers for those little extras is off putting. Psychologically, I would rather the prices were a touch higher and included the whipped cream. Just the way the consumer mind works lol.",

When we walked it (we are from out of town) there was no one else there so we were a little worried. We must have hit it just right because it was about 8pm on a Wednesday night. Within 5 minutes of placing our order, the place got super busy. While we ate, it cleared out and filled up again. Everyone seemed to be pretty regular. Nice clean restroom out back - very friendly staff working. If I had any suggestions it would be to have a space planner come in and help figure out better seating. The wall seating was fine but a little awkward because of table placement. People might hang out a little more if the seating was better. We will be back!",

Multiple employees are actively participating and leading the animal rights activist movements throughout Arizona, so you know this place is legit.  Thier pastries are excellent, and thier food is similar to greasy fast food... but vegan. I want to emphasize that I mean that last sentence in the best way possible. Where is a vegan supposed to go when he is craving something along the lines of a McGriddle (or whatever they call them these days)? Well we can go to Namis, which is awesome. It satisfys the craving for greasy fast food. I just wish they were open when the bars closed! Either way, I wholeheartedly support what this place represents, and I love thier food and coffee. Also that cookie dough cake that you guys made for my birthday yesterday was awesome. None of my family would have guessed it was vegan (except for the part where I ate it, which kinda gives it way).  Keep up the good work!",

The food and beverages continue to be great, but accompanied by awful service! Tonight I ordered a simple iced espresso drink before I go into work. I watched the two customers ahead of me get their orders and leave. Then I sat for 8 minutes while the five employees did anything but make my drink. I was the ONLY customer in the restaurant at this point, and clearly sitting there waiting for my order. It took another customer coming in and getting their coffee immediately after ordering to finally say, \"Hey, is my drink going to be made?\" They all looked at each other and started making it (took 30 seconds to make - not 9 minutes like I waited) but not a single apology from any of them, let alone eye contact. A guy made the drink, set it on the counter and walked away quickly. So glad I spent $6 on a beverage and was treated with such awful customer service! As someone in the restaurant industry, I know mistakes happen but this kind of treatment to a paying customer is never acceptable!",

I go to Green a lot as I live nearby, and have never felt unwelcome there, so I had no reason to think I'd feel that way about their sister joint, Nami. So after a disappointing dinner at Nobou at Teeter House in downtown phx, bf and I were excited to turn our night around with dessert at Nami when we realized we were super close to it and it was still open (since Green would have been closed by the time we got there). Their hours posted indicate they close at 9:30pm on Fridays, and we arrived at 9:20 after calling to confirm they were still open.   We walked in, and there were a few groups of people sitting and leisurely enjoying their ice cream and baked goods. We walked up to the counter and bf knew what he wanted right away (s'mores tsoynami with pb added...SO good!). I, on the other hand, needed a minute to decide since they had a huge bakery case filled with things I never see at Green and wanted to try out, in addition to the full tsoynami menu.   I asked a few questions, which the light-haired woman working there was happy to answer. She disappeared to make bf's tsoynami, though, and we were then met with an icy stare and complete annoyance by the dark-haired woman working there. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, and hey, it's Friday night and she probably wanted to close up so she could go out. But it wasn't even 9:30, and she had zero interest in making this customer happy.   I said I was debating between a cookie and a tsoynami, while she rolled her eyes and continued to tap her fingers on the counter. Her response, rather than a suggestion or recommendation for something to order, was, \"We close in five minutes.\" Ok? I know that already? Why wouldn't you just try to hurry us along in a constructive way, rather than making me feel afraid to ask you any questions about your products?  She continued to sigh and look around, willing us to disappear, and honestly I wish we would have left right then. But we were starving, and I really wanted to enjoy one of their delicious looking treats. I decided in my head that I wanted a tsoynami, but I was way too afraid to have that lady actually prepare something for me as I was pretty sure she would spit in it, in addition to the length of time it would have taken to prepare which surely would have put us over her 5-minute limit. I said I'd take the cookie, to get us out of there sooner. We still had to wait another minute for bf's tsoynami to be finished, and felt her stare us down the whole time. Mind you, there are still parties of other customers at tables still lingering. We were definitely NOT responsible for keeping them open, but we sure were made to feel that way!  I don't care how tasty your treats are, I would never EVER go back there...who wants to leave a dessert place with such a sour taste in their mouth? I will be getting all of my future tsoynamis at Green, where they never make me feel like I'm doing something wrong by asking questions or spending a minute debating between a few items.",

All coffee drinks come with soy at no additional charge, however if you want hazelnut, almond or pecan there is an additional charge not more than .50 cents. and right across the way there is Green the vegetarian restaurant. With this new set up only food is served at Green and only desserts at Nami.

I was not disappointed! No, it's not as creamy as \"real\" ice cream, but it beyond hit the spot for me. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!   I did order some other desserts. I'm sure they were okay, but nothing could hold a candle to that cookie dough. I think it put me in a heavenly dessert blackout. I believe we also ordered Lavender Tea cookies, White Chocolate Raspberry cupcake, and Vanilla and Chocolate milkshakes. Don't judge!   As everyone has mentioned, the parking is a nightmare. I went at an off time to minimize the trauma as I drive a CUV. My passenger had to get out and guide me into a space. It was sooo worth it. I would do it again!",

Great place, good luck!  1 thing - the wood spoons, while I'm sure are biodegradable and all, have a weird texture with the ice cream (at least for me).

I will say that some of the staff at Nami is extremely unfriendly and sometimes rude, acting as if the customers are an inconvenience to them. However, Katie is always really nice.

A unique venue with two buildings one housing a cafe-esque ordering are and the other the kitchen with enclosed dinning that allows just enough of the outside in to be pleasant. The staff was courteous and attentive. The options numerous and bounding with eccentric platters.   Moving along, the important thing here is FOOD people , and it was amazing. While most things seem to mimic meat dishes with chorizo and eggs on the menu, Nami pulls of these imitations by making insanely more delicious vegan plates.  I was blown away by my \"Chicken wings\" the sauce was unlike anything i have had before and i was instantly in love. My OJ based concoction was also amazing as it had some kind of red syrup in the bottom that complimented the not too sweet OJ.   Street pedestrians are not disruptive to your dinning experience and provides ample opportunity to people watch.   All in all this place is a must go location if your trying for a healthy, creative, and delicious meal in Phoenix.",

I've tried a majority of the items on the menu (I'm an ice cream fiend) and I have enjoyed all of them. They have friendly employees and a nice space for catching up with your buddies. I've never tried their coffees or baked goodies because I go there for the soft serve, but I'm sure those are good too.   Lately, I've been trying out the \"Mystery Mash Up\" which is a soft serve masterpiece that is up to the discretion of the employee of the hour. Examples of what has been in my mash-up include red velvet cupcake, Concha Mexican bread, carrot cake. (All of which were vegan too!) If you're feeling gutsy when you stop by, the mash up is for you!   BUT, my all-time favorite combo is the Doughboy with Vanilla soft serve and replace the chocolate syrup for pretzels!! It's the best mix of sweet, salty, crunchy, and creamy. Try it and let me know what you think!",

If you see on their social media that they're running the \"Flying Saucer\" brunch special, reschedule your weekend and be sure to go get this.  It is a large deep fried tortilla bottom, topped with all of the goodness... daiya cheddar, enchilada sauce, soyrizo, hominy, black beans, tofu scramble, fried potatoes, lettuce, pico, guac, sour cream and more red sauce on the side.  You probably won't eat the whole thing, but its kind of fun to try!  The line for brunch is at Nami, which is where you'll place your order and get a number to take to your table.  Green is not open for their menu, but you can sit inside the restaurant and order drinks there, and of course the patio is open. Sangria is in a HUGE mason jar, they have bloody marys and local beers.  There are donuts, and I can confirm the apple fritter is a solid 7.5 out of 10.  Good coffee too if you need a pick me up!",

But, as a non-vegan, I've had all of their offerings, made by non-vegan ingredients in other restaurants, or even in my own kitchen, and while Nami is good, it's not as good, as the original.

This spot was right next to the vegan restaurant that had the best stuff in their menu as well. You must visit both while parked in the Lot!! Friendly staff and both great ambiance for small groups.

Staff is very nice and friendly, location is perfect and plenty of parking. I got the banana cream pie and it was actually good. I could tell it wasn't regular ice cream because I know and love my dairy, so the imitation  whip cream was what gave it away -and honestly didn't care for and next time I will ask to have it without it - but the rest was fine. The sweetness was on par and was not too overly done, as a lot of healthy food places try to do to cover up the bad taste, the add tons of sugar. The crinkles in my ice cream gave a crunch and a nice added flavor. I'd definitely come back and would love to try other flavors. It was a good experience and I am hoping I can find my new vegan ice cream flavor.",

The chai tsoynami had excellent flavors and some type of crunchy graham crackers mixed inside. So yummy! The white chocolate raspberry donut, which was also gluten free, was not so good.

I recently made a lifestyle change of wanting to eat more of a plant based diet for my health so hearing about a vegan dessert place was pretty cool. However, I was not impressed with my experience. It seems as if they try to make up for lack of flavor by dumping pounds of sugar into their desserts. Seriously some of the sweetest things I've ever eaten. Texture of ice cream was okay but the aftertaste was not pleasant. I did like the snickerdoodle cookie but overall I do not see myself returning due to the lack of True flavor and crazy amounts of sugar in their desserts.",

The cold brew is minimally tangy/acid and has a smooth caramel undertone. Donuts are always good, but the weekend selection is much better than mid week. Sunday Brunch has a different menu from the rest of the week, and it is amazing! Most recently we visited on a weekday and I ordered a delicious breakfast kale salad with homemade seed crisps with a cashew sauce in the side. So much flavor. My bf got the Wing Ding Dang burrito filled with 'wings', avocado, tempeh, and other crazy good fillings. We're lifetime subscribers to this place :)",

    "text": "The tSoynamis are wonderful. They are expensive, but is a nice once-in-a-while treat.  My only suggestion to the manager: Please place PRICES on your pastries and sweets displayed in the glass case. (ie. doughnuts, muffins, cake, etc). I'm not in favor of unpriced items.  It is a slight inconvenience for me to have to ask your staff member what the prices are on each item-I don't want to hold up the line. I want to do the math and make my selections BEFORE approaching the register. I think others would feel the same way.  Pricing each item (sweets in the window) gives courtesy to your customers and holds the business accountable for accuracy in numbers. This ensures that the customer knows exactly how much he/she is being charged for tax.",

Nami, short for Tsoynami, is heaven on earth. or the moon. jupiter. wherever there is heaven, there is Nami.  Soy \"tsoft\" serve ice cream. Winkies. Snickerdoodles. Various cupcakes. Various cakes. Coffee with a choice of soy, almond, rice, and even hazelnut milk!  Although they have only done it once, Nami is planning on running a regular Sunday brunch in February. I thought it was amazing when I went to the beta test. Multiple scramble options in addition to chilaquilles and other brunch creations.   Do yourself a favor and stop by. If not for the treats, for the awesome dancing and singing always taking place!  PS... Cheddar and Chive Scone (thank me anytime)",

You cant go wrong with any tsoynami flavor honestly. I would pretty much recommend everything, other than the peanut butter bar thing they sell at the front and the baked chocolate chip cookies, which I have found to be a little hard and dry. The staff are always super friendly and helpful, and the whole place is super chill. Sometimes its a little busy, but the line usually moves  quickly, and the wait time to get your yummy treat is not long at all. I have taken my non vegan friends here and everyone loves it too!

I wanted enough to take home for me and my roommate to share AND have some for the weekend.  But you never let me get there and I ended up with a cup full of ice cream for just him.  My advice would be take the time to find out what someone wants completely before checking out of the conversation.  And don't look complete pissed when I ask you what something is. It makes me feel like I am bothering you and it makes you look like a jerk.

We shared an oatmeal cream, two oatmeal cookies sandwiched together by icing, addicting but a little too sweet for my taste.  Edited-  We finally tried the tsoynami and it was delicious!!!! In our minds we always rationalized by saying we would rather get blizzards at DQ. So happy we didn't this time around.

    "text": "i came here for the Sunday brunch in July when my boyfriend visited me. i got the benedict arnold plate and he got wing ding dang plate.  the tofu scramble that comes with every meal tastes only of tumeric. not good. they need to throw some kala namak in there to give it more of an authentic egg flavor. the hash potatoes were okay - they really needed ketchup but no ketchup was to be found.  i tried one of my boyfriend's wings and it was one of the foulest things i have ever tasted. there was way too much vinegar in the sauce. yet, he still somehow loved them. i'm convinced that boy has no taste whatsoever.  i've never had nonvegan hollandaise sauce so i have nothing to compare it to, but the hollandaise sauce that came on my plate just tasted like mustard to me. which, i imagine, is not the way hollandaise is supposed to taste.  despite all this, the donuts are TO DIE FOR. I got a maple bar and ohhhhhh my god! it tasted just like the real deal!   i don't know WHAT they make their canadian bacon out of, but it is the best dang canadian bacon i have EVER had! it tastes JUST like regular ham!   on your way out, they also have some refreshing complimentary cucumber water which i really enjoyed.   i wish i could give this place more stars simply for being an all-vegan restaurant, but the food is either hit or miss. would i come here again? absolutely. but probably just for the amazing donuts and canadian bacon. :^)",

    "text": "I went for the brunch today.  First of all I just don't understand why they didn't serve brunch at Green, that's where the kitchen is. They were very adamant about waiting until 9am until anyone could place a brunch order even though the place was filling up before 9am.  Though once orders were placed food came quickly.  The plates were brought over from Green and probably played a hand in why the food wasn't hot, but it was more likely due to it being pre made, quite possibly the day ahead of time, and not heated well, which in turn made for a very dry tofu scramble.  I got the Sage Sausage Hashsheesh, unfortunately no sage flavor just one note flavor, even so, it would have tasted better Hot and it would have been nice to have toast with it as well.  By the time we left it was standing room only.   I may be pointing out the obvious here but Nami should stick to being a coffee and pastry shop and let real meals be at Green where food can be served hot from the kitchen into a dining room that can accommodate more people. Maybe consider having an option to order brunch at Nami for the overflow but to have it solely there is asinine.  P.S. I'd like to add that the first time I visited Nami I ordered the Fluffernutterin Soynami which is ORGANIC peanut butter, banana, ricemellow fluff and toasted marshmellow flavor and I stood there and watched her scoop in SKIPPY Peanut Butter=Not Cool=False Advertising=Fail!",

I am thrilled that breakfast is offered daily now as well. Coffee and dairy free milk selection is fantastic and staff is always friendly and inviting, often remembering me, even after long absences. I recommend this to anyone who is willing to explore plant based options. It is a great place for those transitioning or have an issue with dairy.",

I would love to try other things on their menu and I think...no i KNOW we will be back some time too.  Their coffee shop is freakn awesome, which is next door. I got a drink there, my fiancee got some vegan pastries after me telling her don't cause i never had a good one before.  Well i was wrong they were pretty good cookies...(though i don't like to mention it too often). the coffee was great too. It helps when you have friendly fun baristas working.

Even the fake canadian bacon tasted like real meat (though more like bologna, which I think is still delicious).  But the real star of each brunch was the zeppole. Delicious fried donut balls with an sublime strawberry sauce! HEAVEN!   I don't quite understand why they just don't use the space from Green to host brunch, since all the food comes from that kitchen anyway, but I guess it's a branding thing  The rest of the time, nami is fine. Everything is ok to good, such as the drinks, pastries, and tsoynamis. The donuts I've had there (besides the zeppole tend to get stale very quickly.)

Country breakfast burrito (tofu scramble was perfect! with a touch of maple syrup. I'm drooling,,) 2.  Drip coffee (with hazelnut milk. wow!) 3.  Chocolate chip cookie (I waited to eat this later, and it is good that I did. If I had been able to buy a dozen and devour them at that moment, I would have.) 4.  NO's 'n' Mint tsoynami (texture is more ice milk than ice cream, but absolutely decadent, and I drank the melted tsoynami at the end.)  Bottom line, if I lived in Phoenix, this would be my go to breakfast place!",

My kids aren't vegans (that they've told me), so we were gonna figure it out.    They loved it.  They even loved the atmosphere of the small establishment.  Kooky indie ambient sounds.  A girl with a bun atop her head but with a shaved head around the bottom.  High waisted shorts?  Yeah man.  But we got three Tsoynamis.  All different flavors.  They were like $4/5 each.  No biggie.    I'll probably come back.",

I would have loved to eat it with a fork and knife on a plate, but even in its basket the taste was amazing and I know I'll be craving it until my next Arizona adventure. Service was super friendly, my latte with hazelnut milk was on point, and the garlicky salsa that came with the burrito was pure magic.   They only serve breakfast, and the menu isn't up on the board as that is full of all the bakery treats and beverages. I'd love to see a larger menu, or even some menus by the door for more accessibility. Luckily I knew about the food from yelp, so I just asked the people in front of me to pass a menu back. It's a little awkward to not be able to see a menu until it's your turn to order if others are in line behind you. Overall, great job Nami! You've got to taste it to believe it.",

Peanut butter and chocolate is always an amazing combination, of course. They went well with the soy soft serve, although my only issue is that the soy soft serve is not really that soft. I don't know if it was just the batch that I got or if that's how it is because it's soy milk-based and therefore lower in fat than traditional dairy soft serve ice cream, but this was rather icy and gritty. The texture more resembled a sorbet than soft serve.  But still delicious nonetheless!  Service also didn't leave a fantastic impression on me. The ladies behind the counter was a tad busy with previous orders but it wasn't until at least four or five minutes before one of them acknowledged that I was standing there waiting and said that they would be right with me. I don't mind waiting, but I just wish from a customer service standpoint that they would have acknowledged that I was standing there waiting patiently for quite some time.",

    "text": "The bad thing about Nami is that everything is so amazingly delicious, deciding what to get is very difficult.  Nami is a 100% vegan baked goods/ sweets/ breakfast/brunch spot, which is owned by the same person who owns the Green New American Vegetarian restaurants. It's located next door to Green's PHX location.   BRUNCH: Served Sundays, 9a-2p. Arrive early or prepare to wait in a long, winding-out-the-door line. Try to be savvy by calling ahead (as I have), but you'll still have to wait in that line to pay for your order.   My favorite brunch items from the regular menu are...  -Biscuits & Gravy. Fresh biscuits smothered in chorizo gravy, topped w/ chopped green onions. It is so good! It comes with papas and tofu scramble (try the scramble with salsa or Sriracha sauce!), plus fresh and sweet pineapple wedges to cleanse the palate.   -Wing Ding Dang. Their famous spicy/buffalo \"wings\" (they really aren't that spicy, IMO) served with papas & scramble. I like it naked (aka as a plate instead of a burrito).  My carnivorous family loves this dish too.  If you wanna be fancy (*singing* I'm so fancy!), mix it up, or add it up, rather. Because I like the Biscuits & Gravy + the wings, I usually add a side order of wings to my B&G meal for only $5 more.   SPECIALS: They feature a different brunch special every Sunday, which is ingenious really; it keeps things fresh, and keeps the customers coming back. I'll be thinking, \"Oh, I'm going to stay at home this weekend.\" Then, BAM! They'll post pancakes or the Flying Saucer as the special and all my plans have to be rearranged. The great thing about the specials (aside from them being, well...special) is that if you fall in love with one (and you shall!), it will likely be featured again sometime in the future.  My fav specials, thus far...  -anything with pancakes. Be it the Grand Slam, blueberry pancakes, etc., they are ALL delicious. I do wish they'd add pancakes to the full time menu.  - (I'm going to butcher the name) The Flying Saucer Full of Secrets? It's a Mexicana breakfast pizza w/ chorizo, black beans, hominy corn, guacamole, lettuce, enchilada sauce, papas, & scramble (I omit it, but cheese & sour cream too), atop a crispy fried tortilla. IT. IS. SO. DARN. AMAZING! It's huge too! Share it or save 1/2 for later (it warms up pretty good if you take off the guacamole first; no one wants hot guac)  -DaeDae's \"Chicken\" & Waffles. A vegan take on a southern classic, and they nail it!  -Bad @$$ Texas Summer Tacos (that's really the name!).  Tacos stuffed with fried avocados & refried pinto beans. Yum!  The only thing I'm not a fan of is the grits. Maybe I'm just a little too southern for these new fangled grits.  People who like them seem to love them. See for yourself.  BREAKFAST: It wasn't alway so, but they serve breakfast, Mon-Sat, from 7a-11a, so the Biscuits & Gravy, and the Wing Ding Dang are now available daily!   My favorite among the new breakfast items is the Country Breakfast Burrito. It's a big ole thang too!  Organic scramble, tempeh \"bacon\", papas, peppers, onions, & syrup (sans vegan cheese for moi) stuffed into la tortilla. Such a great and super filling breakfast!   OTHER: Aside from meals, there is also a plethora of baked goods from which you may choose, including various tantalizing donut flavors (these donuts are as big as your face!), cakes, cupcakes, cookies, pies, etc. I only drink water, but there is a humongous list of coffee/cappuccino, tea, juice, and vegan milk options. They have a (very) few vegan grocery items too.   Look out for the Nookie (ask about it!) & Sunday sundae specials! Live music sometimes.   TSOYNAMI: NOW let's talk about the Tsoynami! Vegan soft serve, originally in vanilla, but as of 07Aug14, they introduced the CHOCOLATE TSOYNAMI! AND you can SWIRL (chocolate & vanilla)!  My FAV Tsoynami creations -   From the regular menu  -Soy Capitan - vegan Captain Crunch & strawberries mixed in. Berry cool!  -Dough Boy - chocolate chip cookie dough & chocolate syrup mixed in. YUM!  -Cookies n' Cream - Newman's chocolate cookies + chocolate syrup. Classic!  From the \"specials\" rotation -Chocolate Monsoon - chocolate cake + chocolate syrup mixed in. HELLO!  -Orange Creamsicle - orange magic + icing (you heard me!) + whip cream = heavenly dreams that taste like childhood summers.   -Raspberry Beret - raspberry & cream cheese pastry puff & raspberry puree mixed in. AMAZING! (I may or may not have been singing Prince's song whilst indulging.)  MY CREATION - pretzels, toffee nut, chocolate syrup mixed into the soft serve. Create your own too!  If you don't want all that extra, you may eat the Tsoynami plain (think spiral soft serve) in a cup or cone. They can drizzle some of their naturally flavored syrups on it too, if you'd like. I recommend the caramel, toffee nut, and chocolate syrups.   A cup of Tsoynami is a LOT of ice cream. If you'd like to share it, tell the cashier and they'll split it up for you.  Nami for all!",

I ordered the tres leche frech toast and the \"buffalo wings.\" The tres leche french toast was phenomenl. I wanted to pick up the [late and lick it clean. The sauce was what really made the meal and I couldnt believe it was vegan! The buffalo wings hit the spot with that specific flavor. They also had a nice texture against the teeth. One thing I will say is parking is ATROCIOUS and lines can be just as bad. With some patience, it's definitely worth coming here. I wanted dessert, but I had a big day ahead of me and could not ruin my appetite.",

And I called ahead and was told that they would take my order as long as it was before close. I'm extremely annoyed and disappointed with nami and their shitty employee especially since I drove 30 minutes from Scottsdale Road and the 101. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. The vegans should be ashamed!!! This is why I eat icecream that's has products in it that we're involved in extreme animal abuse because those icecream shops have never let me down.",

I'd been hearing from about tSoynamis for years, but since I'm not Vegan and don't live or work in the area, I never made it a priority to go.  That being said, our tSoynami definitely lived up to it's expectations...   Since we wanted to share, the first step was agreeing on one of the 20+ flavors.  I didn't want anything chocolate based, and my husband is very particular, so this was quite a challenge.  I narrowed it down to Fluffernutterin, Chai Tiramisu, O', Soy Capitan, and Ginger Snap!  Jared chose the Chai Tiramisu from there.    Made from organic chai, organic animal crackers, soy whip and Nami's house-made organic soy based \"tsoft tserve\" ice cream, it was a hit, even considering the ten minute wait after we ordered.  (This is one popular spot!)  We finished the entire thing and agreed that it was $4.50 that was well worth it!  I didn't realize that Nami also offers breakfast, coffee, and all kinds of vegan treats in addition to their famous tSoynamis.  Vegan or not, this place is worth a visit... and I'll look forward to returning soon.",

Part of what makes it so awesome is that they don't always have the same pastries/donuts and you're always wondering what the brunch special is going to be this week.   If you haven't been here and you're vegan, you need to go. Stop reading this and go. I won't be offended. This is the best vegan joint in the world in my opinion.   The Rodney Dangerfield (donut sand which) special is definitely what I would choose as a last meal. There's a great selection of breakfast and brunch on the regular menus but it's all about the specials.   They also have tsoynamis, just like their sister restaurant, green. Real awesome for a hot day. There's parking around even if not in the lot, so don't worry about that.   The service is amazing. All of the staff are super cool and friendly and they might even refer to you by name. Ooooor I've just had way to many of their donuts. Could be one or the other.   I moved away from AZ last month and I definitely miss Nami more than I miss some people out there.",

Just off the freeway and an easy place to spot with the bright teal building and signs pointing the way. The location is small, but has quite a bit of parking. There is a handful of seating inside as well at patio seating. We picked up a few menus from the counter and decided on an acai bowl, vegan biscuits and gravy, a cold brew with almond milk and sf vanilla, as well as an iced caramel mockiato. We only had to wait in line for a few moments because someone was in front of us. But were able to reach the counter pretty quick. We were given a number and everything brought of to us when it was ready. Everything was so delicious. Fruit was fresh and granola tasty and just enough crunch. My cold brew was my favorite and probably the best I've ever had. It was over powering or weak just perfect. Great flavor. I wish it was closer so I could get it more often. My sons girlfriend really enjoyed her biscuits and gravy and said her coffee was awesome like mine. I can't wait to go back and try and the desserts because we were way too full when we were done today.",

The baked goods are also delicious, and their coffee is bomb!

The vanilla donut + coffee w hazelnut milk was so good! Thankfully we could get back in line to beat the rush of people ordering food for dine-in or takeout. While the service was friendly, it was a little slow. Our tofu scramble, potatoes, and huevos rancheros were  delicious, and their homemade hot sauce was super flavorful and overall our breakfast was very good. I'd recommend skipping the biscuits as they were very small and over cooked. However, we are so thankful for fully vegan restaurants when we travel and would definitely recommend a visit and ordering some pastries to go!",

Nami just doesn't cut it, to be honest, but I do highly recommend the \"Rodney Dangerfield\". It is basically a chik'n patty with all the fixings including bacon served on a glazed Vegan donut. This delightful sandwich is only served a few times during the whole year so that is a real bummer but when they do serve it...it is a MUST HAVE. Eat, Drink and be Merry my, Friends!!!!!",

I twice stopped in for a tsoynami, which is the vegan answer to a blizzard. I tried the \"Betterfinger\" one night and the peanut butter and chocolate kind the second. Always they were delicious. I wish more places were doing this soy soft serve!  I also came for breakfast on a Saturday morning. I ordered a bagel sandwich with tofu, tempeh, and vegan cheese. It was really good, and it came with a side of fruit. The only critique would be that it took a really long time. But good things come to those who wait!  I also grabbed an apple fritter for my breakfast the next morning, as I had an early flight to catch and no time to find something vegan to eat downtown or at the airport. Even after surviving the night in my hotel's mini fridge, it was awesome.  Thumbs up all around for Nami!",

I like that there is a variety of options for everyone whether it is their baked goods or their tsoynamis. A pastry or ice cream parfait. I love the chill vibes and the fact that I can get a caffinated beverage if I wanted to. It's a judgment free zone that is legitimately good and I would recommend it for a treat. I wish there was a little more seating and that there were more fruit-based options rather than the primarily rich flavors, but otherwise a great place to chill after a meal or whenever.",

I was blown away there ice cream combinations are insanely good and such a treat. The flavors are so good and honestly you cant go wrong with any ice cream creation here you will not be let down I guarantee it. Eating next to the counter I couldn't stop staring at some donuts they had and also I fell for it and glad I did. I had a chai donut and it was also crazy good.

Here's the reason why, we love flavors but the savory breakfast items like the breakfast potatoes, quiche, and burrito were mehh, okay.  They also have soybased soft serve ice cream we had the butterfinger and it was okay, it was chocolate and vanilla swirl, with vegan chocolate chips, and butterfinger crunch. It was okay.

The set up is a little confusing. I didn't realize that you have to order at Nami, but have the choice of sitting there or at Green next door. We opted to sit at Green, since there's much more space. One of my friends who is a strict vegan, suggested the biscuits and gravy-and almost everyone in my party ordered it. I haven't had biscuits and gravy since going meat free a few years ago so I was pretty excited about it! I also ordered their pumpkin spice mocha. It tasted like a holiday in a cup. So, so delicious.  Our order arrived not long after we got our table at Green, so service was quite quick! Our food was quite tasty! They have the market cornered on that dish! I can't find another place that has a vegetarian friendly b&g! Even my boyfriend who is a big meat eater thought it tasted good! The scramble was alright, I think I expected it to taste more like eggs than the veggie taco meat that I make at home (we're probably using the same seasonings-who knows!) It was still good, just not what I was expecting. The potatoes were phenom! Perfectly crisp on the outside! Yum.    Looking forward to a return visit! Green and Nami are two of the best vegan spots in the area!",

They would do well to have one readily available printed menu with all offerings. So we had 2 GF folks and they got the zebra donut and loved it. I got a bagel with herb cream cheese and it was yum. Later we saw the table next to us eating grits and it looked so good we ordered one to share. Very tasty and filling.",

    "text": "I've have used Yelp several times to find great places to eat, but unfortunately my first review is going to have to be negative :(  I visited Nami with a friend the other night and had a pretty bad experience. Basically, the prices were not truthfully stated, the customer service was selective/awful depending on who you are and what you ask, and they seem to be lacking in their regard for those with food allergies.  The long version: It's a cute place and seemed busy with a mostly young, artistic crowd hanging out. After staring at the main menu for a minute trying to figure out where the ice cream was, an employee handed us a separate menu to see the ice cream selection. My friend ordered first, and then I ordered. Everything seemed normal and fine up to this point, but when the cashier told me the price was $5.50 as opposed to the $4.50 listed on the menu, I was a little taken aback ( I hadn't added any toppings) and politely asked why the price jump.   She suddenly became very short with me, almost angry, started handling everything roughly while telling me that there was tax and also that chocolate always cost more (which wasn't previously stated anywhere that I could find). I felt intimidated by her and wanted ice cream, so I said it wasn't a problem and paid. My friend was perplexed at what had just happened and was more angry about the situation than I was at the moment, but I started feeling more annoyed when I turned around to see the same cashier helping the guy behind me and being sweet and flirty with him. Clearly it wasn't just a bad mood that I had accidentally been met with.   When I got my dessert, they called the wrong name (the cashier had never bothered to ask). I was getting sick of everything and thought it would be nice to sit outside, but we had barely taken our seats when a random guy off the street who didn't appear to be a paying customer took the table next to us and proceeded to ask if we minded if he smoked. My friend misheard the question and said it was fine, so he lit up. I realize we were downtown and you can only control your patios so much, but I was over it and motioned for us to leave.   Finally, I quickly noticed I was having a mild allergic reaction. I am moderately allergic to peanuts (more akin to food poisoning than anaphylactic shock), and this was the sensation I get when I've eaten a small amount. I had worried earlier that the mixing bowls might not be cleaned adequately between batches, and it seemed my fears were realized. Both my friend and I decided we won't be visiting there again.",

That includes my travels in other countries, through different states, and raiding the entire freezer section of my local Fry's. The taste is great, the price is great, the texture is - wow, the texture is fantastic. I had my doubts but it was delicious.  If it was closer to me I would buy it every day.",

I forgot the name of the ice cream I got... coco coffee? It is coffee flavored ice cream with coco puffs in it. OMG so freaking good. The cupcakes here are a bit pricey for what you get. The oatmeal cookie with the creme in between in so good. It isn't overly sweet and it tastes healthy even though it has sugar in it.   Took my non vegan friends here and they loved the captain crunch ice cream (forgot what else was in it). I wish the inside of this place was bigger but you could always go next door to green I'm sure.",

    "text": "Tried it out for the first time today and I'm in love! It's a very hipster place, very nice atmosphere. I got the iced cactus haboob which is a latte infused with cinnamon and agave syrup. It tasted amazing! And it's vegan?! It was $4.50 for a 16 oz, so a little pricy, but then again everything vegan is normally more expensive so I'm not complaining about the price. I didn't try any of their pastries, but they all looked very delicious. Only bad thing about this place was the parking. There's very limited parking, and it's shared with another vegan restaurant next door. I went during lunch hour, so parking was full. I had to park at a restaurant close to it. Besides the parking situation, the rest of my experience was amazing! Definitely going back",

I'm a vegan who lives in the area and was really excited to finally try this place, and I'm pretty disappointed that I didn't get the same cheerful service so many glowing reviews have mentioned. Having never been there before, we didn't know exactly how the service works, so when we'd received our entire order (including my coffee) but not my boyfriend's drink, we waited 5 minutes and then politely mentioned to a server that we were missing it. She literally said \"okay?\" (note the question mark) as she rolled her eyes and then never came back. My boyfriend and I just sort of stared at each other awestruck by how rude she was to us, and worst of all I think she may have been an owner or in management. As far as the food went, everything was really good! The biscuits and gravy were our mutual favorite, and everything came out of the kitchen so quickly that it made up for the 15 minutes we waited in line to order. I'm a coffee freak, and their cold brew was perfect. I wanted a to-go box for my donut and was too scared to ask for fear of being snapped at again by someone who clearly feels it isn't their job to help.. Overall, I do recommend this place to vegans and carnists alike, but with caution; expect yummy food but don't expect to be greeted when you walk in and don't expect to see any smiles.",

I LOVE straight espresso so found myself eating spoon fulls of it straight but by the time i got to the bottom of my cup all that was left was tons of syrup. Next time I'll mix it all up and make myself a vegan flurry for sure.   My friend Mariah works in here, if you see her or any of the staff you'll be greeted with a smile and the owners the man too.   Definitely come in here for some vegan deliciousness but be ready for the post soy gas as well.   Suggestions include peanutbutter chocolate bars, peanut butter frosted banana muffins, tsoynamis, and as stated above AFFOGOTOS!   Oh one more tip, if you like chai get their desert haboob ;)",

Usually the service here is decent it always seems like the employees working behind the counter don't want to be there. I feel as though customer service should be the employees number one priority besides not burning the establishment down and providing decent desserts.   It would have been nice to enter the building and been greeted, because we never are... which is weird. It must not be a company expectation to greet paying customers when they walk in.   The reason why the misunderstanding began was because the vanilla vegan ice cream machine was broken and they wanted to charge extra for the chocolate vegan ice cream. Which doesn't seem justifiable if the machine is down and it isn't the customers fault? I mean it's only 0.50 extra per each ice cream serving, but again I drove 15 minutes to Nami only for the vegan vanilla ice cream.   I must admit the vegan ice cream here is amazing! It's definitely not worth the argumentative sass that the girls tonight gave my boyfriend and I.   I myself work in customer service and respect everyone that enters my employers office with a smile and \"Welcome in\". I wouldn't expect this place to last as long as they'd hope if the employees treat the customers with such insignificance.",

Pretty small place but there is outdoor seating. It's a coffee shop set up and they do have coffee and drinks. It's kind of like a vegan version of Bosa (except they sell out of donuts really fast) with cookies, cake, and ice cream too. I believe this js their main tsoynami ice cream hub because I see more seasonal options at this location. Their weekend brunch menu is fantastic. They have a vegan quiche, burritos, french toast, biscuits and gravy. Tons of good eats all veganized and they really hit the spot, also love their seasonal options. Had a pumpkin cream filled donut with pecan toppings, so good! And it wasn't too much filling, they had a little  in the very center, it was perfect. My go too spot for vegan cravings (green has salads and grain bowls but it's not somewhere I come for something light/healthy. Definitely recommend for bringing non-veg friends who want to try veg food.",

In fact, a child would have done a better job. The tofu scramble was dry as were the \"hash\" potatoes. The \"sausage\" was some nasty soy thing topped with that nasty Daiya fake cheese sitting in a puddle of grease.

Upgraded my rating from the last review.  Remember that this place doe snot serve ice cream.  It's only 50% of what ice cream should be.  Vegan, so no cream, no eggs.  So make that 1/3 of what ice cream should be.  Tried a new flavor of tsoynami today - the chai tiramisu with vanilla \"ice cream.\"  It was pretty darn good.  The coconut flavor (ostensible from the use of coconut oil) still came through, but so did the chai.  The ladyfingers were replaced with animal crackers that added necessary texture.  I've grown a little more enamored with this place and given how good this one tasted, upgrading to 4 stars.  Parking still really sucks.",

The building itself is pretty darn small but size doesn't matter because it's really cute inside and they make up for it with their great food. It's usually not too busy when I go, probably because I go at odd hours, so I'm always the first (and only) one in line so I get my order pretty quickly.

Their vegan/gf donut is soooo good and the tsoynami's are huge (but definitely eat it all, because why not). Obviously not health food, but a great spot for a treat every once in a while.

If you like orange juice and enjoy coffee try the OJ espress. I didn't know what to think when I saw that drink on the menu but after trying it, it became a new favorite!  The restaurant is always clean and the employees are always smiling and happy to assist. Good job everyone.  Please try this place if you haven't! You won't be disappointed  My only suggestion would be to somehow add another register or staff to help get orders from the line that quickly ends up out the door every weekend.",

Picture attached! Knowing how delicious the quiche was, I went with my friend yesterday to Order a Sinabun and a Chai Tea Latte. It was absolutely the best cinnamon bun I have ever that was vegan. It was absolutely delicious and whenever I am in the area again, I will definitely come and check it out again. Their doughnuts are usually sold out by early morning so do your due diligence to get there as early as possible!",

    "text": "As a vegan new to Phoenix, I was super excited to try Nami for Sunday brunch and some yummy baked goods. Nami definitely didn't disappoint and I'll be back often to indulge in some decadent breakfast pastries and desserts. Bonus: Nami is not only 100% vegan, there are multiple gluten-free options.  The restaurant itself is quite small with limited seating, so you may have to wait a bit for a spot to open up. The good news is that people seem to move through quickly, so despite the crowds I have been able to find a spot on both of my visits. I wouldn't say the ambiance is anything spectacular, but that's ok since the food speaks for itself.   I had a gluten-free blueberry donut and huevos rancheros on my first visit. Both were really good and I was impressed by the gluten-free donut since most are pretty similar to regular cake and not very donut-like. This donut was amazingly close to an old-fashioned cake donut and was the best I've had so far. My omnivore boyfriend said he enjoyed his food and would come back, although I'm guessing that was because he saw how happy I was and not that he was blown away by the food and it's ability to replicate an animal-based breakfast.  On my second visit, I decided to try the betterfinger Tsoynami special (made with chick-o-sticks and chocolate chips). It was really good and the portion was gigantic. I honestly wish there was a smaller size offered; I don't think I could finish one again as it's quite filling. I took a strawberry gluten-free donut and Yankee Doodle snickerdoodle cookie sandwich to go and am excited to enjoy those tomorrow.",

It was literally like a fried piece of bread with icing. Next time I will try a different donut. If you're looking for an airy donut definitely don't get this one. It was yummy overall.   Their menu is pretty to the point they have their espresso, coffees, iced coffees, and their signature drinks. They also do brunch and all sorts of other yummy meals which I will try next time!  Customer service was great cashier was very friendly.  The location is very small and parking is very limited I got there early in the mining so it wasn't too bad, but I feel if it were lunch time I might of been a little hectic.  Definite must try!",

All the staff I met were splendid and helpful in helping me decode between all the 100% vegan options. There is some cozy seating inside with a few spots outdoors. Go morning and evening to see a lovely transformation with more to eat!  Day 1 Bfast got the nami mcbagel (so flippin good!), a donut (they offer real and cake, both yum), a chocolate milkshake (it was ok  prefer more chocolate) and biscuits and gravy (definitely good, biscuits a little tough, would try again).  Afternoon got soft serve chocolate icecream with chocolate and peanut butter. Way good! Soft serve is tricky to find for vegans. They do vanilla, choc or swirl and then have a TON of fun flavor options to make a lovely dessert.  Day 2  Bfast... so I had to go back for the bagel again!! Toasted bagel with slice of seasoned tofu, tempeh (perfection, and Im usually not a big fan but this was wow), and sauce. Also got a mocha which was alright. And.... went back for more ice cream before leaving the state.  Highly recommend this little spot!",

    "text": "111 degrees in Phoenix!!! I am grilling!!! What sounds better than having an iced cold ice cream after near burning out at the sun. Soynami is an organic soy and coconut milk based ice cream that comes out with different type of toppings. You can choose the base to be vanilla, chocolate or swirl. I chose vanilla as my base and got coffee Coco loco. It was so good! The Coco flakes as a topping for the soy vanilla add the crunch and overall combination of the ingredients were very well paired. It is not a big place. Maybe 15 or so people could take seats but it is cute and cosy. Definitely recommend if you are in the Phoenix downtown area.",

I was confused on ordering in the beginning because they have all their soft serve options on a paper menu but not written on their walls. Their walls had their drinks and their specials.   But anyway, I realized that I've visited this place 2 years ago bcus of their cup designs (and lol you can see my terrible photo of it on yelp also, once I post this review). That was a fun surprise lol. I got their tiramisu chai flavor and omg it was so refreshing. I realized I got their tiramisu w coffee grinds 2 years ago also. I guess things don't change w my flavor choices! Lol. But no really I  can't wait  to go back and try other flavors now! Next time I think I'll just stick to the vanilla only flavor so the chocolate isn't too OP w the toppings. Great experience! And there's parking in the back. Not hard to find a turquoise building either",

I haven't gone there for Brunch, but I do plan on very very soon!   I can't pick a favorite because everything is good there. I like to try a new Tsoynami flavor each time I go there.

I'm not sure if I particularly liked coconut milk, but it was worth a try.  It was very hot and toasty in Phoenix and I ordered a hot coffee instead of an iced coffee.  Not sure why I didn't think to order an iced one...  despite the hot coffee on a very hot day, I still enjoyed it.  Thank Nami for providing me with caffeine :)",

We went to Nami where the person at the register (I really wish I got her name) gave me the worst experience. I was trying to find a lunch menu but was told \"We are serving brunch right now but only for another 10 minutes.\" When I asked what they served in 10 minutes she said in an unfriendly tone, \"we stop serving brunch. We are a coffee shop not a restaurant.\"   After that we decided to leave and went across the street to Coronado cafe where we had a much better experience. (I will post a different review on that)  I'm not sure if all of their employees have this same attitude to would-be first time customers but customer service to me is very important for first impressions.

My only (small) complaint was that the soft serve was a bit icy.

Both were moist and chocolatey with amazing frosting.  If you are vegan in the Phoenix area, go to Nami!",

If you like sweet, than I recommend these, but it was too sweet for me.   Of course the Tsoynami(s) are crazy good. Surprisingly, the peanut butter/chocolate is simple, but delish! I love the Almond Quixote! They are kind of big for me, so I always share with a friend.   The most exciting part is that EVERYTHING is VEGAN! That is the best part since I am vegan.

The blueberry fritter was awesome. Nami definitely does a great job with their vegan baked goods. The vegan huevos rancheros was an interesting take on the classic dish. It had hash browns, chili-spiced black beans, tofu, and some kind of mystery bean or protein that I couldn't figure out what it was.  Nevertheless it was all pretty good. Not to mention, the place was packed, which is always a good sign. However, don't go there on a weekend expecting to get a seat. Very limited seating and for all the people there, it was a slim chance. Especially with loners like me taking up a whole table.",

    "text": "Okay, so as a meat eater I came with a TOTALLY open mind having ADORED Green off of Scottsdale Rd. I guess I was expecting a restaurant, but this is DEFINITELY more like a coffee shop or a much much worse version of Lux. My girls and I went for brunch and were very excited, unfortunately the food was NOWHERE near the caliber of what is served at Green.   My girls had some parfait thing, and a donut while I had a bagel with cream cheese and an Italian soda. My bagel and cream cheese were tasty but ABSOLUTELY bland, no chives, no onion, no nothing to spice this bad boy up. My girls said the donut was dry and revolting and the parfait was nothing she couldn't make at home with yoplait and some granola. I have been WAITING to go here with my boyfriend and decided for a sneak peak and I'm glad my boyfriend didn't come because he would have been SO disappointed. For now, only Green is on the radar. It got two stars because the girl taking our order was very gracious and sweet.  We promptly finished our food and then drove over to America's for street tacos and Vampiro's. Sorry Nami.",

    "text": "I usually don't review places that I have only been to once, but I had such a bizarrely mixed experience at Nami that I just had to speak up.   We decided on Nami after reading great reviews of brunch on Yelp.    I hate it when you walk into a restaurant and it isn't immediately obvious what you're supposed to do: sit down? Wait to be seated? Order at the counter? Well this was one of those places, so we did what everyone else was doing and got on line at the counter.   There was almost no evidence of a brunch. No one was eating brunch. The kitchen didn't look big enough to produce brunch foods. There were no obvious brunch menus. Just one hand lettered sign about a brunch special.  My husband wanted to walk out, but I said no, I saw the brunch on their website, lets wait and see what they say.   So we finally get to the front of the line and ask about brunch. The girl at the counter says \"yes, we are serving brunch, there should be some menus on the tables.\" And she sends us over to the seating area.   We went and found menus on one of the tables and realized there was no table service. We got BACK on the line, which was now pretty long. We waited. I ordered and paid. Tables were filling up quick.  We got the last two-top in the small dining room. Whew.   As soon as we sat down, I realized I was so flustered from the menu experience that I'd forgotten to order a side of sage sausage hash. So I got back on line AGAIN.  I noticed another waitress handing brunch menus to the people behind me in line. Which really, really annoyed me. Right after that I learned that the young lady who originally helped us was a trainee, which explains the menu fiasco, but doesn't excuse her lack of common sense.   By the time I finished ordering again and paying again, I had just enough time to grab two free cups of citrus infused water and get back to our table before the food came out. Wow, quick! Except that we only got one of the two coffees we ordered, and it was in a to-go cup (why? Aren't you guys trying to keep stuff out of landfills?)  So here is the good part of my review. The food was really interesting. We ordered huevos rancheros and chilaquiles. The tofu scramble was one of the best I've had. The chilaquiles were a unique presentation in the form of a \"cake\", kind of like a mille-feuilles pastry.  The posole was addictively good. And when we finally got the sage sausage \"hashsheesh\", it too was vibrantly flavorful. My only complaint with the food is that a few items were kind of dry (chilaquiles, hash) and could have used more of the sauce, sour cream, etc.  that came with them.   My long-awaited coffee arrived scaldingly hot, with unpleasant looking curdled soymilk floating in it. I remember having curdling issues with soymilk and hot coffee when I first went vegan back in the 1980s, but it hasn't happened to me in a long time.  Meanwhile, my husband's coffee with soymilk was just fine. So I asked one of the waitresses if it was \"normal\" and after some  discussion of how it should go away if I stirred it (it didn't), she offered to bring another one with steamed soymilk.  Kind of a surprise after being sent to get my own menu and losing my place in line, but I wasn't complaining!   My husband ordered another entree, because he is shameless, so we got to experience the Benedict Arnold, which came along with my new coffee. Again in a takeout cup? (Why? I don't know why!)  More surprisingly vivid flavors from the Canadian bacon and the vegan hollandaise sauce, which was on the thin side but very tasty. And this time, HE got to wait in line to order and pay (folks, if you're counting, that's four waits in line just to have brunch.)  By the time we finished the last bite of tofu scramble, my coffee was still undrinkably hot and we were not at all in a mood to wait on line a fifth time for a pastry or a tsoynami to go.  So there you go: a mixed review. Very good food, but in an atmosphere that made me feel uncomfortable and stressed instead of relaxed and happy. Pretty much the opposite of the \"mini-celebration\" brunch experience described on the website. If Nami switched to table service and one bill at the end instead of counter service, I would be there every weekend (if I lived in Phoenix...)",

And not only have they reduced the cup size of the soy nami by like 40%, they also haven't filled it each time I have come, there has been about 25% missing the first two times and literally half of the cup was empty tonight.. HALF!  But I didn't even bother to say anything because the line was long from them just horsing around the whole time.  I saw some people they seemed to know (?) walk in and they all literally just chatted at the register for a good 10 min, just laughing and joking around.  The people in line were just staring impatiently and the kid says \"oh, we will be with you soon..\" I couldn't believe it.  I get it you want to have fun where you work, I am an advocate for that we spend 80% of our lives working so we need to make it fun, but you are also running a business and you have lost mine.  It's all just about the money now I guess.",

While this isn't another Green location (don't worry! they will open soon!), Nami serves a huge menu of their delicious tsoynamis and a variety of other baked goods.  This little cafe is all vegan, and while my vegetarian diet allows me to overindulge in regular ice cream -  these tsoynamis could convert me. I had a flufflernutter (note: NOT a sexual term, but instead a mixture of peanut butter and marshmallow cream) tsoynami that was heavenly and huge. YUM!  I did not try any coffee but am very excited to. They offer soy, almond and rice milk - with promises to add more nut varieties soon. Nami offers a beautiful selection of pastries - cupcakes, whoopie pies, cookies.  The staff here was amazingly friendly and welcoming.  I felt like they genuinely cared about my business, as well as any comments or suggestions that we had.      I am glad that I get to be the first review, since I was their FIRST customer. This vegan-niche is much needed in Central Phoenix and I am so stoked for what Nami and Green will bring to it!",

The price is very reasonably, $5.00 on the dot, for an ice cream. You can even add extra pecans or strawberries, etc., at no extra cost.   I would recommend this place to anyone who wants great ice cream! Vegan, vegetarian, or not, I'm sure everyone will enjoy it.   The decor is nice as well. With local artists selling their artwork. It's very minimalistic. Which is very nice. It goes with the PHX downtown vibe.",

Their facebook touts Hot Fudge Sundays in which affogatos and hot fudge sundaes are $2. We went there and asked for a hot fudge sundae and were met with confusion by the barista who brought over the other girl who explained that they \"do not have sundaes but we can put hot fudge on an ice cream cup.\"   What? Is that not a sundae?! Did you not have this posted on your facebook as a special? They're doing a poor job of making their staff aware.   Additionally, the more I get tsoynamis, the more they're screwed up. They often will leave out ingredients or sometimes change them completely. This is a VERY big deal because I am gluten-intolerant... If I order a GF tsoynami, what is the risk they will add a non-GF ingredient and I won't notice until I ingest a bit?  I don't know... Maybe I am over the novelty, or maybe they're just getting sloppy.",

After learning of some food intolerance's I was so excited to find a coffee shop/bakery/brunch place so close that I knew wouldn't have dairy, since all the products are vegan, and have a good amount of gluten free options available on top of that! My mom and I are obsessed with any of their chocolate gluten free donuts, their strawberry cheesecake is divine, and the tsoynamis are so amazing and refreeze perfectly! Their coffee is also just as delicious. Their caramel mockiato is my favorite, but now that I have cut back on sugar I always get a cappuccino which is still very yummy (the taste of their coffee/espresso is scrumptious).

What marred the experience was that my cake was damaged by the cashier when she put the lid down. They took it next door to the bakery to fix it, but it was still visibly damaged. I did contact the store to let them know of the incident, and they gave me a small gift card to make up for it.   I returned a few days later to share some breakfast burritos with my mom and sister. I had heard about the wholly k-aioli on instagram, and I was dying to try it. It ended up being a kale overdose wrapped in a tortilla, but I loved the big ole breakfast burrito that my sister got. She switched me because she's cool like that.   There are many more offerings, especially for brunch, that I have yet to try. Nami/Green knows how to do vegan junk food!",

The pumpkin puree is so good , you can actually taste it....it definitely isnt covered up by all the spices.....just pure pumpkin with vanilla and Graham crackers. YUM.....  Again friendly staff, small seating area but always fortunate to find seating every single time we are here (thank you universe). They too have outdoor seating but their parking can be a bit of a pain.   Go get dinner before hand next door and come here for dessert!

So we'll wait......In the blazing sun, I waited outside as room inside was made available for me to come indoors and actually look at the menu. I was disappointed. Not only with the lack of venue space but the speed of service was slow along with the small sizing of the vegan baked goods. I spent $20 on 3 items and a chai drink. I think that's a bit overpriced, even for a vegan cafe.",

Before you press \"x\" or that little circle, give the reviews a little read first. From food, pastries, coffee, tea and other specialty items Nami gives dairy using cafes a run for their money. Their menu is punny and whimsical, which makes this place feel down to earth and enjoyable.   I decided to caffeinate myself with their \"Cactus Haboob\" a Cinnamon infused Agave Syrup latte (iced) and decided to go with their Maple Bar, that was gluten free. I am not a vegetarian, vegan or have gluten intolerance but I thoroughly enjoyed what I ordered! The latte was perfect, I'm the type of person who craves more cinnamon-spice flavor in my Chai (yes, I am aware it contains more spices than that) which is why I went with the Cactus instead of the Chai Latte. It wasn't overly sweet, caffeinated me well and was delicious -- even with Soy milk. The Maple Bar was a typical fried donut, though not as fluffy, but semi-airy. It was actually impressive, though it was a bit too greasy.  Besides the slight greasy donut (kind of expected), the pricing is a bit steep for what it is. $4.50 for my iced drink and $4.25 for the maple bar, a bit too ridiculous for a GF donut IMO.  Beautiful little space, tons of tables and outdoor seating. The cashiers were informative and answered questions customers had thoroughly. It looks like the Tsoynami's are the most popular thing here, I might have to come back to try it and their food. Great place to catch up with friends, spend solo time or to read. No outlets from what I've seen so far though.",

I was pleasantly surprised when I went there and asked for a  latte and they asked me, \"would you like that made with soy, hazelnut, almond, or coconut milk?\"  WHAT!?! choices?  They also informed me that once they get more settled they want to start making fresh nut milks.   The hazelnut latte is awesome.  Also, the \"Nami Cakes\" are soooo good.",

It's got a fairly descent spice (and I love the spice), and I can actually taste the ginger.  And of course, no dairy.  On the down side, my mom loves her dose of half n half in her coffee.  The non-dairy options just didn't satisfy her one bit.  I would imagine that most of my dairy loving friends might be reluctant to join me there.  Oh well.  P.S. Thanks for the doggie-patio love.

Owned by Damon Brasch and operated on a daily basis by what seems to be a collection of cute college girls that you might see at Whole Foods or a local Co-Op, most of the things that nami does it does very well, perhaps most surprisingly their vegan take on the Blizzard entitled 'tsoynami,' the rich soy-based ice cream lacking any hint of \"soy\" and fixed with any number of mix-ins, some menu staples and other seasonal.  Available 7:00am to 9:30pm I've had them at both ends of the spectrum and honestly prefer them to any frozen \"shake\" I've had save for, perhaps, the concretes at Shake Shack - the pumpkin was particularly excellent as part of breakfast.  Moving to the baked goods, as much as I wanted to like the donuts I just could not, save for the baked zucchini version and the dense blueberry fritters.  Perhaps it was the glaze or perhaps the actual batter but something about each of them harkened that 'beany' flavor that turns so many off to soy based vegan foods.  More impressive, perhaps due to the intense sweetness or a different glaze, the cinnamon roll was a much better choice, as was the turnover with a light flakey shell, sweet whipped soy, and fresh blueberry puree.  Moving on to the rest - I think it is safe to say that anything nami makes with chocolate is a safe bet - the rich organic tablets behind the bar likely 70% cocoa or better and a dominant flavor whether in a tsoynami, drizzled on a pancake, baked into a moist cupcake, or best of all made into dense \"snickers\" fudge that trumps the original by miles.  Last, and certainly not least, for those who don't want chocolate - and all the more so for those unfortunate enough to be gluten intolerant (the real sort, not the trendy Hollywood stuff,) get the Yankee Doodle - a nearly quarter pound snicker doodle sandwich with dense, creamy filling, that is better than any snickerdoodle I've had elsewhere - vegan, veg, gluten free, or otherwise.",

My girlfriend and I visited this place after eating at the American vegetarian next door, which had seemed to be connected to this cafe. There were so many vegan options. They had cookies to cupcakes. Their coffees did not look half bad either. Within the 3 days I spent in Phoenix, I found myself here 3 times as well.  We were so stoked to find vegan biscuits and gravy here. They came with some potato square hash and some tofu scramble which had to be some of the best i have had yet. I also got the country breakfast burrito which was so good as well. The worker was so nice when i had asked for ketchup and had to go in the back to get it for me.  As for desserts, their soynamis were pretty much a soy soft serve. I was not a huge fan of their chocolate one, so I found myself happier when I ordered just the vanilla with my soynamis. Over the course, I tried the cookie dough one (which was a bit sweet when ordered with swirl), the mint one (which was so fun with the vanilla), and the marshmallow one (which was probably my favorite). The workers here were so nice. The place was so nice. I'm kind of glad I don't live in Phoenix. I would be there way too often and would probably give them all of my money.",

I moved to another part of town and don't get a chance to get out to nami as much as I wish I could.   I went this weekend for the first time in probably a year. First the guy behind the counter asked if I wanted chocolate or vanilla. I told him I never had the chocolate since it wasn't an option when I lived nearby. He just said \"it's not very good\" so I decided against trying it. Then I was sad to see that they reduced the size of the cups but the price didn't change. But THEN they only filled my new little cup about 2/3 the way with product!?! I feel that I got around 1/2 the normal portion I used to get for the same $5. I was happy to see they ditched the weird wooden spoons and got plastic.   Overall I really enjoy this place but feel that they are now overcharging for the portions they are giving. Also some of the \"special\" flavors on the board haven't changed in 3 years!",

Coming from Chicago, I fully expected to find fewer quality vegan options in the city of Phoenix. After my first visit to Nami, I was clearly proven WRONG. From the delicious vegan donuts to the surprisingly tasty orange juice-espresso drink, to the infamous Sunday Nami brunch, I fell in love.   But my favorite part? Their soynami, which is a guilt-free version of a McFlurry; a vegan's dream in a cup of yum. I've even taken my S.O., an avid meat eater, to try their breakfast burritos. It's his new favorite breakfast spot. Vegans and meat eaters alike, rejoice!   The staff is always so friendly and even recognizes their regulars. The owner is a passionate, dedicated vegan man who understands what a passion for animals really is.   If you're looking for a healthy, environmentally-conscious meal that tickles your tastebuds, look no further. Nami is your next stop.",

The portion size was very small, and the accompanying salad had more than a few slimy bits of sad greenery. I picked those out and was planning to eat the rest of the salad, but eventually gave up and called it quits. I know vegan fare can be kind of 'rustic,' but I was hoping to at least enjoy some fresh veggies... sadly not the case.

Lethargically lounging around the house as the sun sneakishly peeked through the grayness of densely blanketed sky, we shuffled for thought. Nothing! No Spotify station or Netflix series could keep us bound by confinement. We were insatiable, for............  A MILKSHAKE!!!!!!  Nami was the only place open to satisfy our desires. The menu was appealing. I tend to turn my nose at GF and non-dairy items even though dairy causes some sure unpleasantries.   The place is small and cute. Behind the bar looks like a janitors closet. (I liked it). We felt bad ordering shakes so damn early in the am, but we eradicated the guilt and proceeded. She got the chocolate shake and a cookie dough cupcake. I chose the espresso shake, matcha tea latte doughnut, and also the cookie dough cupcake. Neither of us particularly cared for our shakes despite drinking them in full. It was the doughnut we've been talking about since. The matcha tea glaze that seems to also be supplemented with orgeat, was ok. Interesting, nonetheless. It kind of resembled, faintly, the taste of seaweed, which I don't mind, just unexpected. Still, it was good. However, this doughnut! Effing amazing! It was so perfect. Can you do regular glazed doughnuts in addition to the flavored offerings??? Holy Jeez!!! They'd be sooo good! Thanks!",

I had higher hopes for the burrito I ordered but maybe I just need to try something else off the menu. It was kind of bland and the slice of bread in the burrito was an unexpected surprise. I ordered the Benedict expecting it to be oozing with hollandaise sauce and I couldn't see or taste any of it. It was mostly just tofu scramble with a couple pieces of asparagus and potatoes. Their coffee was fantastic though and the rest of the group seemed happy with their meals. The inside is very small and seating is limited so ordering to go is probably a smart idea. For as busy as it was it didn't take long at all for our food to get to the table. All the staff was really friendly and overall it was a really good experience. Next time we're in Phoenix I'm definitely coming back to try their famous ice cream!",

I'm from the South and I know biscuits .....and they should be arrested for calling the heavy, doughy, strong herb flavored round things on my plate biscuits, yet alone serving them to me! The gravy poured over the top was cold and had no flavor. The tempe bacon came out in a bowl and was nothing but deep fried crumbs, mostly pieces you couldn't even pick up with your fingers.  The hominy grits were described as being in a creamy lemon-garlic sauce....you guessed it....not at all as the menu stated! It was a disgusting pinkish orange colored sauce that tasted very strange and loaded with a sour sriracha flavor. The home fried potatoes were hard & cold and the tofu scramble was cold as well and had no flavor. We also tried a maple flavored donut that also had no flavor - not even a hint of maple - only very greasy. We spent $52.00 for brunch and did not like one thing! If you do decide to eat here - bring some TUMS or a very strong antacid!!!",

    "text": "I live in Portland, the apparent mecca of all things vegan. Surprisingly, there is one thing we don't have here that Phoenix does: the tsoynami.  \"Isn't it just vegan soft serve?\" you say. \"Anyone can make that. You have that in Portland!\"  Um, it's not just vegan soft serve! It's extra thick, extra creamy, not-too-sweet vegan soft serve. And then they put stuff in it! Completely different. It's basically a veganized Blizzard. Not only do they have the classic combinations you remember from the DQ (banana cream pie? with vegan nilla wafers?), but they have their own delightful and creative combinations. I'm kind of embarrassed by how many of these things I've eaten since I've spent a total of maybe three days in Phoenix, but my favorite combination is Cap'n Crunch Berries and strawberries. Maybe you're like me, and somehow the seemingly obvious combination of cereal and ice cream has eluded you until now. Well, go to nami and the nice folks there will set you straight about that.  The only thing I wish they would improve is the whipped cream. If, like me, you are not a fan of coconut, then it tastes overwhelmingly like coconut. I know some people like coconut, or don't think it clashes with whatever dessert they are eating, but I don't think the flavor of coconut belongs in my banana cream pie tsoynami, okay? I know, I sound ungrateful. However, it does not stop me from literally mandating that we stop and get tsoynamis every time we're in Phoenix. It shouldn't stop you, either! Just maybe order something without that.",

I got three pastries, the strawberry cupcake (which I believe was gluten free), the yankee doodle (also gluten free I believe) and the chocolate, berry croissant. The strawberry cupcake was okay but the other two were amazing! The cake was kind of dense in the cupcake but I did enjoy the frosting and the fresh strawberry on top. The yankee doodle was 2 snickerdoodle cookies with frosting in the middle. It was amazing, one of the best vegan, gluten-free treats I've had. The cookies were moist and flavorful and the frosting sweet and delicious. The chocolate, berry croissant was excellent too. The croissant itself was good, but not quite as buttery and rich as a non-vegan one. The chocolate was more of a chocolate mousse and had very good texture and wasn't too sweet. It was also topped with some yummy fresh berries. I'm gonna try the ice cream next time I'm in Phoenix.",

But, I don't mind waiting for good food. One thing that did disappoint me last time I was there - I ordered a donut displayed in their case (along with other breakfast entrees for my group) and paid. While waiting for the food, they told me that they actually already sold the last of that donut. I really love donuts and it was one of the main reasons for my trip there so I was pretty bummed. They did have one other flavor left, maple. I settled for it and of course it was delicious so I wasn't too upset at that point... although I did have my heart set on the one I ordered and paid for.

Overall I was impressed and went home happy. The treats were moist and delightful to eat while chatting with company. I will be back for sure.   - carrot cupcake is a definite winner with it's slivers of carrots - banana donut takes second because of the real banana goodness it gave off and ! it was topped with nuts ! - peanut cookie was okay, but PEANUT flavor wasn't coming through as strong as I like - vanilla slice takes last place because even though it was decorated with icing and a small snicker doodle, there was no texture to the cake layers  The ratio of main ingredients in Nami's recipes was perfect so whoever does the baking has something good going on. Many vegan pastries I've tasted give off a distinctive after-taste of poor quality oils. Thankfully, I didn't taste that in Nami's goods.   On a side note, though, seriously - the icing is ridiculous. Too sweet and way too much!   One thing that would improve the store is better use of the counter space. Wouldn't it be nice for the owner to invest in a roomier display case?",

The staff was very friendly and i was little confused when it came to ordering, but they were very helpful. I came with my closed minded non vegan family and they thought the desserts wouldn't taste good, but they were proved wrong! The chocolate raspberry case was sosososo delicious. We also got a few tsoynamis. The betterfinger, a chocolate one, and the mash up. I really enjoyed the mash up. The texture with the added baked good made it very fun. I've never been too big of a fan of soy Ice creams, but I really enjoyed this one!  One thing that intrigued me that I didn't order was the orange juice with espresso. I've never even heard of anything of the sort end I definitely want to try it out sometime. I wish there was a location where I live in California!  I'm just going to make sure to stop by the next time I'm in Arizona :)",

    "text": "I come here perhaps more often that I should. Tsoynamis are my downfall *queue up Price is Right fail horn*. But then again, its better than blubbering over to Dairy Queen and crying inside an M&M Blizzard of shame.  Inside this hopping hub inspired by the geniuses of Green is part bakery, part ice cream shop, and part coffe haus....sprinkled with brunch awesomeness in the morning and on weekends. This is my go-to spot for any sweet treat, because as my friends know I do not eat crap. I am now on primarily a low-calorie, low carb, primarily vegan/fish based diet. I watch what I eat and work out regularly.  How does Nami fit in? After a stressful day, instead of grabbing 5 beers and nachos, or a heaping 3 scoop fatty ice cream, I come here. I grab a 100% soy-based ice cream treat called a Tsoynami, which comes with dozens of variations made up by Nami. My personal favorite is The Doughboy, with vanilla soy soft serve and 100% organic chocolate chip cookie dough. Horrible for you? Meh, not great by any means. Better than Coldstone. Actually, you could probably have two Tsoynamis and be still way better off than anything Coldstone, Baskin Robbins, or Dairy Queen has to offer.   They also have a very high quality coffee bar which provides basic coffee fair, along with a dizzying arrangement of baked goods all vegan friendly. The vegan doughnuts blow my mind. I have yet to dance the doughnut dance at Nami, but I can do an eye test and say \"I approve\".  Overall, I can't give this place enough love. It's super trendy, the food on the weekends (look at their menu) are so to die for gang...its delicious. Green is a business genius for concocting the awesomeness that is Nami. They have this man happy, and a customer for life. Enjoy, 5 stars.... for everything they have here. Just go, if you haven't been yet. Just do it already!",

I went back to let one of the girls there know with a dirty look on her face she quickly said no exchanges and turned her back to me right away. Literally no care in the world, not even I'm sorry let me try to make it better. So if you want to get something you didn't order don't bother letting the staff know because they don't care!

Little did we know the storemade granola contained cashews which is in the peach cobbler ice cream. When my friend noticed cashews were in her ice cream, she kindly asked the girl working the register if there were cashews, the girl said yes. She informed the cashier that she is severely allergic and to that the cashier said \"oh well we have it posted\" and pointed to a tiny sign in the kitchen. There was no reaction as to the well being of my friend. We looked over the menu again and there was absolutely no warning that there were nuts in the ice cream the only warning was that there may be cross contamination between all food products offered. Will not be visiting as the gals working were very rude and terrible.",

    "text": "Come for breakfast, but come back for the desserts.  A co-worker of mine and her husband are steadfast vegetarians and fell in love with this place almost as fast as they fell in love with Green next door.  This place is owned and run by the same owners as Green, and the space is small just like its counterpart.  Whereas Green is more of a lunch and dinner spot, Nami is more of a breakfast/dessert spot.  We got here around 10am on a Saturday morning and by the time we sat down, it was packed.  Not surprising given how many vegans and vegetarians live around Downtown.  My co-worker recommended I get the biscuits and gravy.  I saw a couple of cupcakes that caught my eye in the pastry case (cookie dough cupcake and red velvet cupcake) so I got those and an OJ too.  As with Green, you order at the counter and seat yourselves.  Total for all of my food was $20.  Food came out to us in less than 10 minutes.  Let me first go into the cupcakes.  I've had vegan cupcakes before at Treehouse Bakery just west of here, and these were equally delicious.  The frosting on both was dense, but creamy and decadent.  The cake itself was actually more dense than Treehouse's which made eating two pretty tough, but it was worth it.  As for the biscuits and gravy, I actually loved the tofu eggs as they put enough spice and herbs on those to make me forget I was eating tofu.  It didn't have the texture of an egg at all, but it was still great.  The home fries were also tasty and crispy and light.  As for the biscuits and gravy itself, mixed reactions on this one.  There was a lot of onion on my gravy which seemed to be a little bit of overkill.  The biscuits were also a little dry.  It was okay, but I think Bragg's Diner (also just west of here) does the vegan biscuits and gravy thing a little better.  All in all though, I was pleased with my first trip here.  The vibe is super relaxed, the gals behind the counter are super friendly, and the portions of food on every dish I saw were plenty hearty.  Even though the food is all vegan, I can assure you that no one leaves here hungry.  I can't totally recommend the biscuits and gravy for breakfast, but I fully intend to explore other breakfast menu items in the future.  I've also heard a lot of good things about the tsoynamis, so that'll be on my to do list.  Just be warned, once you take one look at that pastry display case, its pretty much impossible not to order one.",

    "text": "Okay, so I've made a Yelp account just to leave this review. I've been vegan for years and naturally have been coming here since nami and green have been open!!! I've always loved Sunday brunch and would come almost every weekend. The baristas were ALWAYS sweet and friendly no matter the weather or the length of the line (usually out the door and wrapped around everywhere) and would even go out of their way to remember my name. Around 6-9 months ago that attitude changed. All the new hires are rude and unhelpful and the atmosphere of the place, consequentially, turned clique-y and unwelcoming. Today I placed an order for pick-up because I had to go straight from nami to work and when I went up to the counter the cashier told me, \"You're gonna have to wait in the line like everyone else.\" Woah. I didn't know the meaning of \"pick-up\" had changed and even then you didn't need to be a dickhead about it... I obviously didn't know. I've noticed the lines becoming shorter as well with this weekend as an exception. So I was forced to wait in line for 35 minutes for food that was sitting there for 20 minutes prior to me coming to pick it up. Today's service was above-and-beyond terrible. Yes, it's hot. Yes, lines were long. But that is no excuse to be a bitch. I work in food service too and if I had said anything like that to a customer, my ass would've been fired. I haven't even eaten my food because by the time I got through the line, it was cold. It's a shame because I've been putting off writing this review because the food is so. damn. good. But nami and green are places that vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike come to eat and honestly the image that these girls are portraying of vegans hurts all of us and makes us ALL seem like pretentious bitches. Again, this review has been a long time in the making but today was just the last straw. Do no harm but take no shit.  P.S. that girl with the nicotine patch needs to be fired.",

    "text": "My husband and I had lunch at Green at some point during Thanksgiving week, which is next door to Nami. We had such a terrible experience at Green, that we were hesitant to go over to Nami (I believe they're owned by the same people). Read through Nami's reviews, and decided to take the plunge anyway.  No regrets at all! It was such a relief, the two ladies working that day were so nice and accommodating. They took the time to explain their tSoynami menu to us, and they didn't rush us. I ordered the Chai tSoynami, and I believe my husband got the cookies and cream one. We loved it! Portions are huge, but we licked up every last bit.   I knocked of a star because they are pretty vague about what they put in their tSoynami's. Some of the items seemed too good to be True. Would be nice if they listed detailed ingredients on their menu, since a lot of commercialized \"vegan\" foods tend to be highly processed and, sadly, unhealthier versions of what they imitate.   Anyhow, we were visiting from LA, and I really wanted to stop by again before we left but we never got to! So sad! Anyway, we're excited to go back next Thanksgiving!   Thanks Nami !",

    "text": "Delish espresso drinks, yummy cupcakes, and soy soft serve so good it passes for real soft serve with the pickiest critic - my 4 year old daughter!  Here's the deal - I used to be vegan YEARS ago so I am perhaps more open to places that specialize in vegetarian/vegan.  However, I don't SEEK out vege places anymore because now I am back to eating everything (see my review on the Pork Dip from St. Francis if you're skeptical).  I decided to check this place out because they have a modern vibe to it and all they do is coffee and desserts. I've passed it every Saturday for the past year and have always been drawn in by their clever signage. I had NO idea they were an \"alternative\" cafe until I walked in and checked the menu.   This place has incredible baked goods and they do a great job with the coffee. That's pretty much all I need to be happy :) For starters, it's hard to find a good espresso spot in Phoenix. Secondly, I remember that with the vegan-restricted diet my general rule of thumb was if I was eating out and the food tasted good - it was probably not vegan. This place has just perfected sweet treats that are gluten and dairy free which just makes me even more impressed with it.   This is definitely getting bookmarked as my cafe/bakery go-to when I'm in central Phoenix.",

The first time i went here was a random Sunday with my girlfriend and we were looking for places to eat and everything was closed but we say this place had donuts and i was really feeling like having one. Got 2 one for me, one for her and they were really good and would recommend them. The second time we came in for brunch a little before 1 on a Sunday found out they were out of 3 different things on the menu so my girlfriend got the \"Wing\" Ding Dang and I got the French Toast. So we sat down and someone came over to tell me that they're out of the French toast (So 4 different things) and i looked over the menu and I didn't want anything else so i ask just to have a refund. So i have to go back over to the register and there was a line and I don't like to cut so i just waited in line...again. If my girlfriend brings me here again i hope they don't run out of everything and i can actually try something and give this place a good review.",

    "text": "I don't even know how many times I've been to Nami since it opened. It really doesn't matter that it's 30 minutes away from my house... I make up reasons to go weekly.  An update on the \"Here's what we ordered\" section: 1. Cinnamon roll - A classic. They heat it up for you so that it's too warm and fragrant and irresistible not to finish. It's perfect. I hate it. I hate them. (That's a lie.) 2. Chocolate cake doughnut -  Call me a conspiracy theorist, but I'm pretty sure that this is just a ring-shaped piece of chocolate cake. That said, it's a very good piece of ring-shaped chocolate cake. 3. Sugar cookie -  I brought this home for my very non-vegan little sister, who tasted it immediately and said, \"This (nom) is the best (nom) sugar cookie (nom) I've ever had in my life!\" 4. House made granola, yogurt & berry parfait -  Nami's granola is like cocaine. You will never be able to have enough of it. But that's okay, because on some mornings it just feels right. I do wish the yogurt wasn't soy-based and the berries weren't frozen, but honestly, it still rocks. 5. Vegan Victory Bar -  If you're looking for something more wholesome, this peanut butter-chocolate-spirulina (hence the green color)-nut-seed bar will satisfy your sweet tooth without making you feel gypped for picking the 'healthier' option. 6. Hazelnut milk latte -  Any of the lattes from Nami are fantastic. Choose coconut, almond, soy, hazelnut, or rice milk for a strong, nutty cup of awesome (and you can sweeten it with Stevia!) 7. The MASH - If you're feeling daring, this is a fun way to spin the wheel of dessert fortune. I've ended up with a carrot cake tsoynami and a mint chocolate chip one. Both were delicious, but nothing beats the Monsoon. 8. Brownie - Literally the best brownie I've ever had. So chewy-rich-intensely-chocolate-y. It didn't even taste like there was flour in it. I want a hundred of them. Right now. 9. Peanut butter bar - Don't be intimidated by this dense looking log. It's actually a light, crunchy, nougat-y bar with a thin layer of chocolate on top, although it does resemble peanut butter fudge.  The thing is... I've never had brunch here, which means I should probably head back on Sunday to get a feel for it. Now there's an idea.",

Seeing as the coffee bean is a central part of my daily existence, it took me long enough to make my first visit.  Unfortunately, I would have been fine just delaying it indefinitely.  I can appreciate the whole vegan thing if that's their deal - there's a niche market for that and somebody's got to fill it.  What is astonishing is the refusal to placate the non-vegan crowd (i.e. overwhelming majority) and carry some half & half.   Introducing almond milk to whatever you're drink may be is an utter waste of espresso - trust me on this one.  The novelty of the concept, the trendy and energetic vibe, and the friendly baristas are among Nami's merits.  It's not the kind of coffee house that beckons you to sit down with a laptop or a book while you sip your favorite hot drink.  Hard, uncomfortable seats encourage you get what you came for and take it for the road.",

    "text": "The first time I went here, I didn't come away feeling very satisfied mostly because I'm cheap at times. I spent nearly $7 on a cookie and a \"winkie.\" The winkie was good but it wasn't *that* good. I was sorta sulking about that and didn't think I'd go back. But alas, on my next visit, I got one of their Dairy-Queen-like \"Tsoynamis\" and damn if that stuff isn't crack. I went back a second time in four days because I had to have some of that cream, non-dairy goodness. I had a PB-Chocolate one and more recently a 'Smores one with marshmallow fluffer. Good stuff. I like the coconut milk better in some ways. Anyway, I have to be careful around that place but I mean that in a good way.",

    "text": "Nami has great donuts. They are like a cross between the cake donut and the more airy donut. They are chewy and more substantial than the airy-type donuts. The donuts are really delicious. The tsoynamis are always good. Their grits are cheesy (vegan cheesy) and come with half a roasted jalapeno on the top, so you can cut it up and spice up the dish, but the grits are one of the best things on the menu. I've always loved their spicy wings. I feel like they are still getting their feet wet on some other items, and hope they improve over time. The scramble, for instance, is somewhat dry and flavorless. The hash potatoes, which are usually a favorite of mine, are also somewhat dry and flavorless. If they could improve on those two things, I think it would be much better. They usually have a special each weekend. Get there right when they open if you want a big donut selection. The place is packed on Sundays!",
