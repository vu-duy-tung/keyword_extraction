Both are good! If you like crispy, the whole fish is what you want; if you like spicy, the salsa one is your choice!Just the service needs to be better, we wait for 15m to get water and drinks. A great place the hang out with friends. Also, the chips are bomb! They are served warm!! I love this place! Besides, it is near the ranch market. If you want to buy some grocery after a lunch or dinner, go there!!",

Be forewarned, the location doesn't look very appealing from the outside. It isn't in the best of neighborhoods but don't let that fool you, this place is amazing! Inside it's very charming, Mexican sea life decor, the tables are very colorful and all look different. Soccer games are usually played on the televisions, it would be a good spot to come to watch your favorite team over some margaritas or delicious horchatas!   Their ceviche de pescado and camaron is my favorite dish. I'm a big seafood lover and this place knows how to do it right. If you're into oysters I also suggest ordering that to start. So good! Chips and salsa are given upon seating and their salsa verde is a bit spicy but so delicious. I wish I had a jar of it at home. Great horchata and cheap Negra Modelos! The staff has always been great and very friendly.   This place is a hidden gem.",

The ambiance inside the restaurant was cute and enjoyable.  The server just had a flat affect.  He was neither friendly or rude.  I thought the menu prices were a bit high.  We paid the full prices for lunch on a weekend.  We got plenty of free chips and the two salsas.  I really enjoyed the green one.  We did not receive any free tostadas like other yelpers report receiving.  The portion sizes were good and I left full with some leftovers.  My son is 12 years old and tried a half order of Oysters on the half shell.  It was his first time trying oysters and he really liked them.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito, the cheese enchiladas and quacamole to share with my two little girls.  We really enjoyed the beans, the rice (and I am not usually a fan of rice!), and the guacamole.  The enchiladas were just okay.",

The outside pretty much looks like a crummy box but the inside is super colorful and lavishly decorated. I wasn't sure what to expect but the food sufficiently impressed me.  You get two salsas with a basket of chips--both of which are super delicious. The avocado salsa was tasty and not super watered-down like at some places. The red one, which is semi-spicy, is very tasty. I don't even know how to describe it. It was just so.... TASTY.  We received some salmon (I think?) ceviche on a crispy tortilla with our meals. Very yummy and the veggies in it tasted fresh. I ordered the enchiladas de jaiba and the others ordered fish tacos. Both were good although I think I liked the fish tacos better than my enchiladas. I thought the fish was really good and light. I noticed the rice seemed to be made with those frozen mixed veggies you get at the supermarket, which I thought was kind of funny, but it still tasted good so I guess it didn't matter.  Service was very prompt even though the server wasn't particularly engaging. I actually prefer my service to be this way, so if you prefer a waiter/waitress that likes to make conversation, then maybe this isn't the place for you. Interior of the restaurant looked relatively clean.  I definitely recommend Mariscos Playa Hermosa. Don't be scared of the rundown appearance of the area! I cannot speak on the authenticity of the food but at least it was yummy.",

    "text": "So my coworker and I had a business trip to Chandler, AZ and I had told him about my last two experiences eating seafood in the desert. Fish tacos that looked and tasted like nasty dried chunks of leather. You figure AZ shares a border with Mexico so they must share some learnings but it was nothing like the awesome fish tacos you get in San Diego. Need to avoid seafood in AZ.  We randomly drove by this place and decided, ok that looks interesting. Surprised me when I found it was another seafood joint. MMmm ok we're here and too hungry to look for another place.  So I ordered the crab enchilada plate and it was actually pretty good. Real crab meat stuffed enchiladas with rice and beans on the side. The shrimp ceviche tostada appetizer was also pretty good as well.  The exterior looks a bit sketchy but the interior decor was cute with a fishy motif straight out of the Bahamas. All in all a nice place for lunch.",

First off you know you're in the right place where you wonder if you're car is safe to park there. You walk in and a complete array of colors hit you, leaving you breathless, speechless and eventually i'm sure sightless. The food and margeritas were amazing. Shrimp Cerviche was to die for.

The staff are all friendly and very attentive to you. The atmosphere is very chill, with different cumbias playing softly in the background and a soccer game always on TV.

    "text": "BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER.  Do not even look at the menu, people. Just order a Dos Equis and the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce.   My boyfriend and I found this place on the Yelp app, like most eateries we visited while in Phoenix. I cannot express how happy this place made us. We loved the restaurant, the service and the food so much that we actually came back and ate there again before heading to the airport.  The Molcajete Caliente is $22 for two people. You each get your own ceviche tostada and plate of rice, beans and salad (all delicious). They also bring a warmer with corn or flour tortillas. But the main event... a volcanic-like cast iron cauldron (a molcajete) teeming with bubbling green sauce with various kinds of grilled meats and seafood hanging around the outside. The smell alone will bring you halfway to heaven, but ZOMG, taste explosion! SO GOOD.   It comes with two breaded fish filets, two pieces of grilled steak, two of chicken and four big shrimp. Plus, there are little chunks of octopus in the sauce itself. If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the fish (or the seafood in general), but every bite of everything was honestly amazing. It may be the best sauce I've ever eaten.   The service was superb both visits---super friendly, fast and helpful. The server was the one who recommended the molcajete in the first place, actually. The prices are almost unbelievable ($22 for a VOLCANO OF FOOD??).   The restaurant itself is really clean and full ceramic tiles and colorful artwork. Some reviewers have commented about the dodgy location. The neighborhood seemed fine to me, though I don't live in Phoenix so I could be mistaken. It's mostly residential, but well-worth making a special trip (like, every single day) for this food!  Note: If you're planning on ordering the ceviche as an appetizer, just be aware that you might not get your house ceviche tostadas. We didn't get ours the second visit because my boyfriend insisted on getting a full order of ceviche. He was hoping they would bring both (because he's insane and would eat an ocean full of ceviche if left on his own), but they didn't.",

    "text": "Excellent place to get great seafood!  Restaurant and Food:  The restaurant is nice and cozy.  At max, there are maybe 15 tables in the entire joint.  However, don't let the size, location, and lack of flashy chain-like display fool you.  The menu has a wide array of choices from fish tacos to different styled fish plates.  I had a fish plate prepared with garlic and a lemon pepper seasoning (Pescado Ajo Mojo I think) as well as an horchata for my beverages.  The food was impeccable!  In my experience, coming across fresh seafood in Phoenix is hard.  The seafood was well prepared and fresh (no gamy-fishy taste).   Additionally, the menu has pictures of almost every dish so you can gauge your interest in a choice (Visual examples appeal to me).  Service:  Spot on along with the food!  As mentioned previously, the restaurant is not that big.  Our server was always on top of her game and frequently stopped in to check on us.    Atmosphere:  The restaurant has a bright decor that is very fun and fitting for the type of restaurant.  Not to sound cliche, but you will feel almost as if you are at mom's kitchen (I'm Hispanic and my parent's house has similar decor).    Overall, this place wowed me with the food and the service.  For the price and quality you will receive at Mariscos Playa Hermosa, I doubt you can find many places in the neighborhood that will compete with this place.  Try it and see for yourself!",

We went ahead and ordered their shrimp cocktail, shrimp tostada and oysters. When the oysters came out, right off the bat we knew it wasn't fresh. My mom ate one oyster and immediately said \"I'm not going to eat anymore\" and had a disgusted look on her face. She said when she swallowed it it wasn't cold but tasted warm so I touched one of them and she was right. We told the waitress and she got the manager. He stuck his thumb in one of them and said \"it's cold\" then says \"do you guys still want it?\" We told him \"no\". After that incident my moms cocktail came out and I had a bite from it. That was also warm and so I told my mom to put ice in it from her water. The only thing that was good was my little dish. It had a lot of chopped up shrimp and pico de gallo on top of a tostada.

What was in there that was blue?    My shrimp had the digestive tract intact which is a turnoff for me.  The Garlic Shrimp (which I see from other reviews is very popular) just didn't work for me.

For the food, we started with guac. and a shrimp cocktail. The guac. was so flavorful and man, they jammed so much shrimp in the great cocktail. What a start!!! Next we ordered the Molcajete Caliente (shrimp, beef, chicken, fish, octopus in a green sauce). As we were anticipating the arrival of our dish they brought us all out a complimentary ceviche tostada. This was my first ceviche and I was impressed. Not saying much though since I have nothing to compare it to :). Now for the Molcajete, I loved it so much. Every meat was perfectly cooked and the boiling hot green sauce was perfect. To go with the meat, they provide each person with their own tortillas, beans, and rice. Okay, the tortillas were good, the beans were good, but the rice was the best I have had. I just loved everything about the dish. I would eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and then do it all over again the next day.  As for service and as mentioned above, it was equally impressive. I wish I remembered the young ladies name but she provided wonderful service. She checked on us often and always did it with a smile. The staff also came in at the tail end of the meal and sang the happy birthday song to my brother. What I have never seen before is they sang it first in English and then Spanish. What a cool idea.   My family will be back again soon and you should stop in too.",

First I started with a Michelada, well seasoned and just the right ratio of red, to beer. Hey oh! Just what I needed.  I was excited for the prepared Oysters which were top notch, filled with extras, and fresh. They also treated me to a fish ceviche tostada, that I would absolutely purchase again. Get the ceviche tostada.   The recommendations from staff were spot on and I wish I had gotten the fajitas because when the sizzling skillet's flavor wafted past me... I realized I should have purchased them immediately.   Still, my entree was fantastic and that rice, unique, and flavorful.   Can we talk about the ambiance here? Super duper colorful and unique (at least for Phoenix)!",

When I called they told me that as long as I got here at 8:30pm they would take us in. We arrived at 8:18pm & they had the doors closed. I called them from outside their door at they said they are closed. There service is horrible, they are not ethical or trustworthy. I'm really upset that they made us drive over 15 miles & not provide the service hours they advertise. I do not recommend this place at all.",

When I get there I go to the counter and let the gentleman know I was there to pick up an order, he tells the girl with glasses and curly hair behind the counter I was there to pick up a phone order and she very rudely says I didnt call in an order and she doesnt have one. Then another girl who overheard comes up and says \"I have your phone order\" she was nice and asked me to wait. So I'm standing there waiting and as the other female is walking back to the counter she elbows be and doesnt bother saying I'm sorry, excuse me, or I apologize. I continued to wait which at this point I'm super angry that this person thinks it's ok to treat a customer like this, so I decide to leave. Who I the world would want to be treated like this. So I leave and I call the place when I get home to make a complaint and a guy answers the phone which I believe is the one who was at counter... he tried to say I was rude for leaving and he tells me not to call back and hangs up on me! I have family and friends that have been going to this place for years... guess who just lost business",

Each visit we must go to MPH to enjoy what is the best Mexican seafood in the southwest.   Where to start? Nearly the whole menu is good. Start with shrimp or mixed seafood cocktail and then move onto the seafood platters. Fried Fish, shrimp, abalone, it's very tasty and well done.   If you're not in a seafood mood they're pretty good about that too. We recently tried the \"volcano\" (sorry the Spanish names fail me) with various meet and seafood cooked in a lava pit of red or green sauce and cheese, and that was delicious.   Wash it all down with Margaritas combined with Beer: literally they serve a Margarita + Beer combo that I order every time and it's the greatest way to accompany the meal.  Service is excellent: the waitresses are skilled, knowledgeable about the menu, and happy to serve you promptly.  The decor, made up of hand-carved and hand-painted Mexican-style wooden furniture, is exquisite and really brightens up the dining area.  Overall it's a wonderful dining experience and well recommended.",

The neighborhood doesn't look all that great but the food was good. The prices seem to be very reasonable, but then we are used to paying California prices. The parking lot was a little small but we have a large truck. Loved the decor. We were leaving as the mariachis were arriving, too bad. Definitely check this place out if you are near Downtown Phoenix.",

    "text": "Awesome place. After landing in Phoenix and having a craving for Mexican food, we drove to Mariscos Playa Hermosa. The restaurant was packed, but we had no problem getting a table. There was also a mariachi band that was playing music from 7-8pm, which was a pleasant surprise. I got an horchata to start off, which was amazing! Not too sweet, which a nice, but not overpowering kick of cinnamon. Highly recommend if you're a fan of horchata.  We ordered the Ceviche de Pescado as an appetizer, which was delicious and had a nice flavor from the fresh fish mixing with the cilantro and salsa. The fish was a little rubbery, but all the flavors still melded together well.  For our main courses, we ordered the Camarones culichi and Pescado a la veracruzana. Both came with a side of salad, homemade beans, rice, and fresh corn or flour tortillas. The shrimp was absolutely delicious, and the green sauce had a nice cilantro flavor to it. The only complaint we had was that the portion size was a little small for 3 people, and it was so good that we really wanted more. The fish was lightly breaded and sauteed, and was moist and succulent. The vegetables complemented the dish well too.   If you're in Phoenix and have a craving for Mexican seafood, I highly recommend Mariscos Playa Hermosa!",

It's small and parking is limited, but it was raining (!) and so we were able to grab the last parking spot.   Our food was nothing short of stupendous. They start you out with free ceviche on a mini tostado, and it is delicious. I got the enchilada jaiba (with crab) and it was really good, with red chile sauce. The wife got the camaron (shrimp) culichi with green chile sauce. We each ate about half of our meal and then traded because I love green chile and she loves red chile. I must say, I got the better of the trade! The green chile sauce was nothing short of orgasmic; just fantastically deliciously awe-inspiringly good. I could eat that sauce on a shoe and be happy. The rice and beans were also excellent, way above the typical non-descript flavor, and each meal also came with a salad! What a deal. We were so happy that Yelpers turned us on to this place. Whenever I am in Phoenix for whatever reason, I am heading back to this place!",

The meat was very average in quality and flavor.  The grilled fish was fantastic.  A bit of a miscommunication between my husband and the waitress about being gluten free.

    "text": "For a Mexican restaurant and the area its located in it seemed really, really expensive. Our check for 2 people was $60. We both had 1 drink and 1 entree and split an appetizer.   The rating is highly influenced by the total price of the experience.  On to the food-- the ceviche was OK at best, it was comprised of 90% pico and 10% shrimp/fish. I've had ceviche from several dozen places and I'd have to rate this ceviche in the bottom 3 : /  The 'Camarones Fantasia' were very dry (over fried a little) and small for an order/the price. It came with 6 medium sized shrimps and should have been at least large or jumbo so as not to become so dry while cooking optimally. Ironically enough, I thought the actual taste was not terrible, but I could not describe them as \"succulent\" by any means.  The 'Camarones de Ajo' were very good but lacked some flavor that should have been there and that has been present in other Ajo dishes I have sampled throughout the US and Mexico.  The drinks were AWESOME! The micheladas were very great and by far the best part of the meal. However, they were the most expensive I have ever bought (40% more than the most touristy of spots in Mexico, which if you understand, is saying a lot!).   I'm quite confused how they can charge so much for the drinks and dishes here.  The experience was not \"bad\", but its certainly not a place I will return to anytime soon.  3 stars is the best I can give this place.",

(Thank you, fellow Yelpers, for pointing me towards Mariscos Playa Hermosa.)  This adorable little restaurant looks like absolutely nothing from the outside- just a plain looking building with a sign.  The inside, though, is cute and definitely has an authentic Mexican feel.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were warmly greeted and seated. Within a few minutes, we were offered beers and tortilla chips.  We opted for guacamole to compliment our tortillas, the former of which I was suspicious at first because of the seemingly runny consistency.  Boy, was I wrong - the guac was tangy and full of flavor. I would love to have their recipe!      Based on other review, we opted for the molcajete for our main curse.  It. Was. Off. The. Hook.  It arrived in a medium-sized, deep bowl, filled half-way with a delicious spicy cheesy gray.  Along the sides of the bowl are shrimp, chicken, beef and scallops.  We just kind of pushed all the meats into the sauce and then dug in.  And while this dish is meant to serve up to 4 persons, we totally killed it and finished every bite.  (Disclaimer:  I'm a small person and really don't eat that much.... The molcajete was JUST THAT GOOD.)    The next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll make sure to return to Mariscos!",

The verde sauce with the chips is really flavorful.   Fish tacos were great, packed with fish and so were the enchiladas (but with crab meat). The red sauce was a little on the sweet side. Paired with some of their many hot sauces, it was perfect. Large potions and good prices.   We made reservations for 6 on a Saturday and it was picked when we arrived but cleared up shortly after. I love the bright colors and there's a patio.   The service was excellent, staff working together and very friendly. I used the Yelp free cake offer and had the chocolate cake. Really good, giant piece.   If I've ever in town again, I'll come back. May have made a regular of my grandpa!",

It was just an hour before closing time but the restaurant was still very busy, a good sign. We were immediately seated and were treated to warm tortilla chips and salsa, plus some really good tostadas. My friends ordered margaritas and said those were delicious, especially with tajin instead of the usual salt at the rim of the glasses. We ordered the molcajete caliente, an impressive array of various proteins arranged around a pool of green culichi sauce. It was enjoyable although the carne asada was just a tad on the drier side. I also ordered fish tacos for my friends as they have never had those before; they were a bit doubtful at first if they could finish those because they were already full, but ended gobbling them up and said they were really good. Though this place was a bit pricier than most Mexican restaurants, that is justified by the quality and quantity of the food and the very friendly and efficient service.",

There's so many nice touches, the experience is overall awesome.  We tried:  Molcajete Caliente: an incredible dish. Got it with the green sauce. It's so tasty but not spicy. Comes with steak, chicken, fish, and shrimp on the sides, but also octupus in the green sauce.  All the meat was perfectly cooked, but actually I enjoyed the fish the most, it was perfectly seasoned and juicy. Definitely a must try.  Guac: really fresh tasting and perfect with the chips",

We let her know we were out of town and was welcoming and helpful with the menu.   Ordered a Coctel Grande Campechana & a Carne Asada plate.  I can only go into detail regarding the Carne Asada plate seeing how this was my personal plate. The steak was tender and juicy (not dry at all). Beans & rice were good, nothing special but overall good. The Coctel was good according to my wife, not just full of juice like other places but a good amount of seafood in that cup   Friendly staff & good food makes this place a sure place to return to.

    "text": "Whenever a friend or out of towner asks me where they can find the best Mexican food in the valley, my answer is always the same.  The more questionable the neighborhood, the better.  That's by no means an exact science (nor meant to be demeaning to the neighborhoods for which many of these establishments undoubtedly take great pride).  But with apologies to the numerous suburban Mexican food establishments that dot the valley landscape, the working class Hispanic neighborhoods of inner city Phoenix are where I've always found the best Mexican grub.  When I told my Dad I wanted to try this place and where it was, he hesitated a bit thinking we were driving into a death trap.  Fortunately my food adventurist side convinced him to make the trip with me to try this place for the first time.  And oh, what a place.  I first found out about Maria Maldonado's creation on a segment of the wildly popular PBS show Check Please Arizona (you can watch it on YouTube right now).  From the onset, you could tell this wasn't your typical Mexican establishment.  While they have all the usual Mexican staples you'd expect (burritos, tacos, fajitas, etc.), the emphasis here is decidedly on seafood.  But even the meat dishes here are completely unique to the valley (more on that in a bit).  Thanks to the Check Please segment and the fabulous Yelp reviews, we came in the door on a Sunday afternoon.  As I expected (though to the shock of my Dad), the place is a rainbow of colors from the furniture, to the walls, to the numerous photos and keepsakes on the wall.  And yet its small enough that it feels like you've walked into someone's dining room.  We got here just before the dinner rush so we got sat immediately.  My Dad and I first got a couple of Dos Equis Lagers to start.  I mention this because the beers that came out were HUGE.  The beers came in cold gigantic beer mugs to where there was at least 2 bottles worth of beer in each mug.  Did not see that coming, but a GREAT start to the evening.  Next, we (unexpectedly) each got a complementary appetizer of ceviche on a tostada.  Basically a variety of different fishes (I think I picked up octopus, shrimp and tuna) mixed with guacamole and other veggies with a hint of lime juice.  Very refreshing dish.  Then they brought out the chips and salsas (one of which was a green salsa that had a big kick to it).  All of this food and drink before we even ordered our own dishes?  Wow.  My Dad got the grilled shrimp skewers that were seasoned and wrapped in bacon and cheese.  I went with the dish this place is most famous for.  A giant molten bowl of green tomatillo sauce and cheese with shrimp, fish, chicken, and beef lining the rim of the bowl (see my photo).  This my friends is the Molcajete Caliente (even the name sounds intimidating doesn't it?).  Both of our dishes came with a side of beans and rice (though even the rice was different as it was more of a rice pilaf).  While the tomatillo and cheese is bubbling hot (and pretty much stays that way), its actually not spicy at all.  But it coated every piece of meat on the bowl beautifully.  The meats were all grilled and seasoned perfectly and with a coat of that tomatillo and cheese I was in heaven.  My Dad absolutely destroyed his bacon and cheese shrimps he loved them so much.  I was going to use the Yelp check in for the free tres leches cake (which they do honor), but we were both so stuffed full of food and beer we couldn't eat another bite.  Between the great food, festive atmosphere, friendly waitress and stuffed stomaches, our first venture here was a highly successful one.  Total tab for the 2 huge beers, chips and salsa, complimentary ceviche tostadas, main dishes, sides, tax and tip was $75.  The Molcajete is $30 by itself so that's what pushed the price a little higher (they also have a bowl for larger groups that runs around $40).  But trust me, this is $30 worth spending.  It can easily feed two or more people (though I stupidity tried to take it down myself).  I'll happily enjoy the rest for lunch tomorrow.    So like I said, if you're craving good Mexican food, look towards the inner city area.  Even though i was pretty excited about this place, even I was surprised how generous the portions were and by all the freebees.  Its no wonder the place was packed the whole time we were there and why it seemed like every customer was smiling.  The Maldonados originally created this oasis in the desert to help pay for their kids' college education and achieve the American dream for their entire family.  If their cuisine, staff and happy customers are any indication, I'd say the hard work has paid off, many many times over.",

I walked in and there were only 4 other people eating,  then again it was only 6pm. I was greeted by a friendly gal.  I picked my own seat and immediately was offered a drink.  I got agua de  Jamaica which was perfect not too sweet. I was brought chips and salsa a few minutes later. There were 2 salsas, an avocado salsa and a red salsa. The avocado one was perfect,  the red was great but OH EM GEE my mouth was on fire. I love hot sauce, but this for sure was blazing!   I really wanted shrimp and asked for recommendations.  I was recommended the bacon wrapped shrimp but decided not too because I'd feel guilty of it being too fatty. I then was recommended the A ala diabla shrimp. I usually love spicy shrimp, but at this point my mouth was on fire from the salsa.....sooo i got it anyway. Why not?    My plate arrived with about 6 shrimp and tons of sauce with rice beans and sode salad.  The beans and rice were great, but holy moly the shrimp were BLAZING SPICY holy moly. They were still good.  Overall, the service and food was great. I will def come back on my next visit.",

They offered to either seat us immediately on the patio, or let us wait outside for a table inside.  We opted to wait, and we were so glad we did.  The wait was pretty short and we ended up with an awesome table.  Awesome because of its location but also awesome because of the craftsmanship and artistry that went into the hand-carved and hand-painted table.  It was beautiful.  Then came drinks.  Our margs were a bit too sweet, but not too bad.  They need to use lime juice instead of bottled sweet-n-sour.  If they would have, we'd of ordered more drinks.  After drinks came the seafood ceviche.  SUPER GOOD.  We then got our shrimp fajitas, and those were amazing.  I think we'd go back, but we'd probably get margaritas elsewhere first.",

They brought us a complimentary ceviche tostada, the fish so so fresh and delicious the citrus flavors were amazing. The chips are freshly baked and the salsa's are wonderful, the green is mild not sure how it is made and the red is spicier but still has manageable for someone like me that isn't into spicy and great for someone who loves spicy like my husband; wonderful flavors. My mother loved the fried shrimp said it was one of the best fried shrimp she had in a long time. My husband and I along with my father-in-law shared the earthen pot filled with steak, seafood and chicken that came with an amazing green sauce ( we choose the mild for me). Along with it is your choice, or you can get both, homemade flour or corn  tortillas. The sides of rice and beans are even very good. For dessert we had the flan and the coconut cake both were excellent but wish they would bring back the tres leche cake that I had the last time we were there which was to die for. We will definitely return and a lot sooner this time.",

Hector, our waiter, was patient throughout the many questions we had and even have us a complimentary ceviche dish to start!   Food: O.M.G! In order of our favorites: 1) molcajete. GET THIS!!! It is basically a volcano of saucy lava that is erupting with steak, chicken, shrimp, and fish. It is served with rice, beans, and tortillas and is made for two or three people to share. It is made in either a green tomatillo (mild) sauce or a red diablo (spicy) sauce. I liked the diablo more bc it had such amazing flavor.  2) guacamole: best ive ever had!! 3) Shrimp in cream sauce: yummmm. Great flavor! 4) Shrimp and octopus in garlic sauce - also good 5) shrimp tacos - just okay. Would choose the above over these  Finally, don't forget to check in on yelp!! Show your waiter and you get a big free slice of cake!!",

My husband and I like to treat ourselves and indulge here and there and when my friend told me about this place, i had to go try it out for myself.  We started out with the ceviche yum, they have shrimp and fish, but we went with the order of fish ceviche since my husband is allergic to shrimp. We loved every bite, it comes with tostadas on the side and you can make your own.  We shared the Molcajete, holy smokes! was sooo good. it had alittle bit of everything. You can choose to have a spicy sauce or a mild green sauce we went the the mild green sauce and my husband loved it so much he took the remaining sauce to go.   We're not big drinkers but they have several special drinks i saw walking by that looked very appetizing, I think i will take have to come back with my girlfriends for happy hour. If you're still hungry, ask for the flan, the waitress let us know they make it in house, so I had to taste it out. You can tell its home made. I might even go back to take some to go next time. We're excited to find this place and look forward to try the rest of plates.",

However,  being here 3 times now I can say that some of the reviews are correct, service is a hit and miss, the food depending on what you order will vary as well. We had the \"Molcajete\" which is a must order serves 2-4 depending on how hungry you are. And we had the \"Mojara Frita\" whole fried fish. Both come with rice, beans, and a little salad. It was all good and filling.   If you are in a hurry don't come here, this is one of those places that is meant to be enjoyed at a slow pace. Order,  eat chips and salsa, have a drink, chit chat and wait for your food. Atmosphere is great!",

Their menu is extensive, however they also have it sectioned out, in case someone in your party wants something other than seafood.  We ordered the shrimp ceviche and the aguachiles. They tasted fresh and spicy. My hubby ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were really good.  The price for the food portion is a little on the steep side, but will definitely visit again.",

The prices here are a bit higher than you'd typically expect at a regular Mexican restaurant, but you have to keep in mind that you're ordering seafood and seafood in the desert ain't cheap.  (well, it's probably cheap at some places but it's also probably really gross at those places).  for the non-seafood entrees the prices were lower and more what you'd expect.  I ordered a fish taco entree that came with 3 tacos and beans and rice for only $8.99, so that's not bad at all.  The fish was fresh and tender and I really enjoyed the tacos.  However, I did not care for the complimentary fish ceviche tostada thing they served - the fish there tasted a little \"off\" to me.  I would definitely come here again!",

    "text": "What a fantastic meal I had.  I've been desiring amazing Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  Since I moved here, I've been to several places that were underwhelming, at best, and generally just not good to me.  So, I'd given up on Mexican Food in AZ and I just didn't eat any.  Well, a conversation in Yelp Talk about Mexican Food inspired me to check out some different places and this one turned up in my searches on Yelp and other websites.  I'm happy to say that I was so thrilled and enjoyed my meal very much at Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  Again, another hole-in-the-wall, but still quite the find.  Mariscos is located in a pretty seedy part of town, so don't get nervous going there.  They close early, so you'd better arrive early.  You will find that there is a full bar inside this colorfully decorated resto.  Don't eat at the bar.  That things not suitable for anything except decoration as the bar itself doesn't extend out far enough to make it comfortable to sit there.  (this is a tip from a person who opted to sit at the bar)  I tasted a few items off the menu.  The shrimp in diablo sauce was my favorite.  I ordered extra diablo sauce on the side.   The sauce has a smokey taste with the heat of the peppers.  Perfect for my heat seeking taste buds.  They prepare the sauce \"fresh to order\".So there is a charge for $3 for the extra sauce on the side to go.  I used that sauce to make more shrimp diablo at home later that week.    I also enjoyed the camarones culichi... shrimp in green sauce.  Culichi is a tomatillio sauce made with some dairy product and cilantro and of course the poblano or tomatillio peppers.  The sauce is simply to die for.  I left there satisfied and happy!    I will return and take a friend for the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce.  Can't wait.  I'm sure it will please.  They have a check-in offer too, so be sure to check-in.  Oh, that parking lot is TINY.  Be aware of that when you go.",

Our waitress was so sweet that since we weren't able to decided on coconut or chocolate she gave us a small slice of each. These cakes were moist and delightful.

There is a reason the reviews for this restaurant is so high - it has great food, great service, and beautiful furniture/ decorations.   Before we received our order, we were given chips + salsa/guac. The chips were very oily and I wasn't a big fan, but that initial impression was soon overcome with the best tasting ceviche on top of a crispy corn tortilla. My mom, who isn't a fan of cilantro, said that it was the highlight of her meal.   My dad and I decided to share the House Special/ Molcajete ($30 for two people), which consisted of shrimps, two tilapila pieces, two chicken slices, and two beef slices in green sauce. It came with corn tortillas, rice, beans, and salad. None of my family members can eat spicy foods, but there is also an option for the \"Diablo\" sauce, which I heard is pretty spicy. We were definitely not let down - it was just the right taste and the right temperature. My mom got the garlic shrimp (I think it was $13?) and the portion for the main piece was relatively small-medium in size, but it also came with rice, beans, and salad. She liked the clean taste.  The service was great; our waitress constantly checked in to see if we needed anything. The noise level was loud because there were constantly people coming in and out of the restaurant, but that signifies just how many people are fans of this restaurant. Also, for anyone who's curious, there are TVs (might be good for game-days).  At the end of our meal, we got a free coconut cake by checking in to Yelp, and the cream on the cake was delicious; the icing tasted like a sweeter version of coconut ice cream. When we were finished, we were way too stuffed. Dad said that we should come back again with the aunts - that's one of the rare times I've ever heard him say, \"let's come back again\".   Highly recommended! If you like seafood + Mexican food, go here.",

I want the whole experience.    The carne asada came with sauteed onions and home made tortillas.  The crab in my wifes seafood enchilada had real crab in it (most places uses imitation crab).   The chips and salsa had home made chips, and the salsa had a couple of options, and was hot and flavorful.   The chicken tacos were fresh and the whole deal was 100% on point.   I can't speak spanish, but I know home made food when I see it.     Even the decorations:   The chairs themselves were full of color and straight from Mexico.     We ate, enjoyed each others company and the waitress even comped us with some kind of free salmon corn tostada things for what clearly appeared to be for their new gringo customers.

Their drink menu is just as amazing, I recommend the Mango Diablo, the best way to describe it is an adult mangonada, yummy! I've been here with groups of friends and family and they all loved it. One of those visits was with a group of about 15 people and they were able to accommodate the big group into a private area with plenty of space. The service is always amazing and the servers are always enthusiastic and ready to provide a great experience. On top of that, the decor is bright and fun, giving the place an authentic Latin touch. They also play great music and have a mariachi band on Sundays. I do have to warn you they are pretty busy during the weekends but the 20-25 minute wait is well worth it.",

We had the molcajete caliente for two.  It was excellent.  The only letdown was the carne asada in this dish that features shrimp, fish, chicken as well.  It was a bit dry and not as top notch as the other ingredients.  These are served with an AMAZING green sauce in a hot pot.  We also had both chicken and shrimp tacos. The shrimp tacos were \"crave worthy\".  They came with rice, beans and a small salad.   The beans were super good.  Guacamole was fresh made and delicious.  As others have stated it is no cheap date but a good value based on the portions, flavors and freshness of the seafood!  Not to mention the friendly service!",

This is a smaller restaurant with mostly families or people coming to have a special meal.  Always fairly full but we have never had to wait for a table.  There are some servers that speak English if you do not speak Spanish, the menu is in Spanish and English.  We come here often, whenever we are in this area of town.  However, we also often make the drive here because it is worth it.  We have eaten at several other Mexican Seafood places in the area, some are worth going back to but none are quite as good as Mariscos Playa Hemosa.",

We arrived and we had a private party table in the back room for a graduation, the decor is something to note.  It's like being in Mexico (not that we are too far away), I was thoroughly impressed with the hand crafted chairs and tables.  How did they fit them inside those tiny little rooms?  Did they build them in there?  How can I get these for my house?!  Anyways, food was great, service was at par, and the drinks were delicious.  The graduate said she went there all the time so, with fair pricing and good food.  This seems like a great place for a casual meal. Beware: Parking lot is super small, may be best to park on the street if you can't physically see parking as you pull up.  Also, make a reservation if possible, place was packed at 5:00pm on a Tuesday!",

    "text": "Have you ever experienced molcajete? HAVE YOU?!  This is THE place to have that experience. I say \"experience\" because molcajete is more like a witch's bubbling brew than a meal. Mariscos is a cozy little restaurant in an area a lot of people won't flock to, but it stays busy. All the good stuff applies here... friendly service, great food, Mexican beers, Mariachis (on Fridays, I believe). It's just a great place. And, now that the formalities are out of the way, I can talk about the molcajete.   Molcajete is actually the name of the stone bowl that is used more traditionally as a mortar for salsas and such. As a dish though, it's a beautiful mixture of spicy/tangy sauce, grilled meats, grilled veggies, and cheese. It's one of my favorite Mexican dishes, period. Mariscos serves theirs with tons of fixins (beans, tortillas, salsas, etc.) that could probably fill two people up on their own, but their generous serving is much appreciated when ordering this dish for a small group. It's definitely one of those meals that'll impress people when it gets served. Order one for the table, and you're going to have a good time.  I could spout on all day about molcajete... But, would ya look at that, I have a decent size review already, and I haven't even talked about the restaurant's specialty, seafood. Well, I'll let you read some other reviews for that. I'll just say that I love their tostadas de ceviche de camaron!   Go to Mariscos Playa Hermosa, and enjoy!",

When you walk into the door of Mariscos Playa Hermosa, you feel like you very well may be in Mexico.  It feels extremely authentic, with a festive atmosphere, a staff that doesn't speak too much English, and food that is delicioso!  It's nothing like the Americanized Mexican / Latin places  you've been to before.   Don't load up on the chips and salsa as the portions are big and you'll want to save room for what is to come.  Their house iced tea is very good if you want something other than a cold cerveza.  As Annie D said in her review, I highly recommend going with the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce. You can't go wrong with that!  I ordered something else and ate off of Jared's Molcajete Caliente along with my own.  That sauce is incredible!  Note that this place closes early during the week.  We met some friends there at 7pm and at 8:20 we were the last ones in there and we could tell the staff was ready to go home.    I can't wait to return to this local gem of a restauran for another memorable meal very soon.",

We had oisters \"preparados\" which means they add a slice of avocado and a large raw shrimp and thin slice of purple onion. We also tried the shrimp and cucumber appetizer with a special sauce that tasted good with a hint of soy sauce. The garlic shrimp came with a decent portion of shrimp and rice and beans on the side. The shrimp was swimming in garlic butter,bell pepper, onion and seasoning. The ceviche tostada was tasty and the micheladas were ok, I prefer to have them with lots of lime chili seasoning and plenty of Clamato. The salsa and chips are good the beans and rice we're great. I love the variety of options they have available and I would definitely come for more.",

The shrimp ceviche had delicious spices, wonderful chunks of delicious goodness, and was definitely a 5 star dish.  My only kvetch would be that it needed about three more slices of avocado.  The shrimp tacos were good. Not 5 star--maybe 3 and a half since the shrimp tasted faintly (VERY faintly) of iodine, and I would have liked some freshness added into the taco--like shredded lettuce, or cabbage, or tomatoes, or something.  Fish tacos were bomb!  4 and a half stars.  They just miss being 5 star because they really were too salty.  HOWEVER, even with too much salt, I will order them again.  They were yummy.  The Shrimp Culiche, wow.  Amazing flavor.  My suggestion, soak up the crazy good sauce with maybe the rice, or dip your tortillas in it, but don't waste it!!!  Oh, and the restaurant is cute inside too!!",

    "text": "Very Good Family owned Sinaloan Style Mexican SEAFOOD Restaurant that's open everyday for lunch and dinner. Prices are reasonable I'd say the average plate price runs about $13.00. Most of the menu is seafood so plan on having seafood if you come here.   I've been here several times over the years and I'd say most of the time but not always they start you off with a complimentary mini fish tostada that delicious with your chips and salsas.  I can vouch for the Fish Veracruzana and the Fish Poblano plates because I had them before and the fish was light ,fresh tasting and flaky. The sauce and toppings  is really what made these dishes good to me. They come with your usual rice and beans and tortillas. They have many choices in this kind of dish.  Last time I was here the place was packed and we were the only table in the place that didn't order the Molcajete so I wanted to order it this time.  The Molcajete is a boiling hot caldron filled with your choice of Diablo Hot Chipotle sauce or Tomatillo Sauce. The menu that we had reads Fish, Shrimp, and Beef. But what we received was Battered Fish, Shrimp, Beef, Chicken and Octopus. The Diablo sauce is very hot and spicy but also very tasty and I found myself adding it everything I ate. Over all I thought it was good and fun to share. It cost $22.00 and feeds at least two people. It also comes with rice , beans and tortillas. If you get the Molcajete you should eat the shrimp first because they get over cooked just sitting on the hot Molcajete as ours did. I'm not a beef person but I thought the beef came out prepared the best in this dish.  I do note you should view the photo of the building so you know what the outside looks like before you give this place a try.",

The area is less than inviting and at night it feels destitute.  We decide to take a chance and the interior is warm and bright. Patrons are enjoying themselves and we are greeted with big smiles by the waitress.  We were seated and served this pretty tasty ceviche tosta on the house. We also ordered a separate order of ceviche, that wasn't as good and took forever to come out. But skipping on to the entrees, people were pleasantly surprised.. ranging from my vegan co-worker to my meat head only co-worker. I had the fish in red sauce with rice and beans which was awesome. My vegan friend had the enchiladas with green sauce which was also tasty. I did hear the drinks were not that tasty.. so be wary of the margaritas.  Good food, reasonable price. I'd give it a 2nd go.",

The food was absolutely delicious.  My partner and I enjoyed the seafood soup as well as the abalone cocktail.  We also each had a michelada.  The food was exceptional and the micheladas were not as spicy as I've had, but I prefer them less spicy anyway.  I'm sure they would spice it up more if you asked for it.  The place is really cute too--super funky tables and chairs and lots of color.  I will be back!",

I ordered the Camarones al Mojo de ajo...sad to say, nothing special nor did a I get that great garlicy flavor.  If anything there was mostly bell pepper as filler, I didn't dam order fajita style so what's with so much bell pepper and onion???  Rice and beans were good, but just a doppling of both, really??!!  I also ordered the shrimp ceviche as an appetizer, again it was just meh.  Nothing really stood out, other than the limey juice and again, it was more of pico de gallo all mixed in that was another filler.  Maybe it was just an off day, but nothing special.  I still love San Carlos Bay on McDowell Road.  I have been going there since the early 90's and the have the best tasting seafood dishes.  Only down side is that they are cash only.  My daughter ordered a shrimp cocktail, hoping it would taste similar to those in Rocky Point, she told me that it was nothing special.  My niece ordered chicken enchiladas and nothing seafood, but said they were the best enchiladas she's had.  Go figure!!",

The sauce is complex, but I am unable to break it down by ingredients. I will take this oportunity to bash Pete's Fish and Chips once again.  You could not get any further from Pete's than by visiting Playa.  Playa Hermosa is not kidding when they claim to bring the ocean to the desert.  I had several fat shrimp that had been \"cooked\" in lemon juice.  They sat there on  cucumber slices, glossy gray and white, splayed open and bathing in the juice with wedges of avocado. They were so fresh, they looked like they had just been hauled up and dumped on the deck.  This is a mouthful of ocean, there is no mistaking that you are eating seafood!  Food like this touches parts of your brain in a powerful way.  If you were not reared on fresh seafood and the thought of sashimi makes you queasy, then I suggest you not jump in with both feet, maybe work your way up with small portions of ceviche.  The service was very attentive and professional, the feel is genuinely festive. Though Playa Hermosa is a family oriented restaurant I have never noticed any children acting out.  I've found this to be the case generally downtown, the children are well behaved in public, whereas in Chandler, Scottsdale and Mesa I have witnessed children in restaurants behaving more like pro wrestlers than diners.  I live about a mile and a half from Playa and I keep asking myself why I'm not down there more often.",

Their Camarones Culichi  - shrimp in a ciltantro/tomatillo sauce is to die for - possibly one of the best dishes in all of Phoenix.  Only downside is they close rather early - but well worth the trip - I regularly drive out from Tempe.",

    "text": "Ditto to all the positive reviews out there.  This place rocks.  The outside actually isn't THAT bad, but yes, I would hesitate to go in if it weren't for all the fantastic reviews on yelp.  Once inside, it is just as all the pretty yelp pictures depict: a clean and bright dining room with colorful tables and chairs.  My friend and I ordered the mixed seafood cocktail and the shrimp culichi.  Both were super tasty, as were the complimentary ceviche tostadas.  The culichi sauce was so good that I had to stop myself from drinking it.  The seafood cocktail was very refreshing - just what is needed during the Phoenix summer.  It had shrimp, oysters, clams, abalone, calamari, and octopus.  Almost all the seafood was fresh and sweet, and the dish was huge.  The only critique is I can do without the clams.  They are the tiny canned ones instead of the fresh ones like I had in the cocktails in Mexico.  Service was really good as well.  Overall, this was a very pleasant experience.  I will be back and I am telling everyone I know about this new find.",

It's basically a giant hot lava bowl full of deliciousness and even though 3 of us couldn't finish all of it, I was still sad when I couldn't cram any more of it in my face.  We also shared a fish fillet with octopus and shrimp in a mushroom cream sauce.  It was also very good, but the star of the show was definitely the green sauce in that molcajete.  We are going back next weekend and looking forward to it!",

I can't really say anything bad about this place and I don't think that the two colleagues visiting with me could either unless you're offended by kitschy decor.

Granted - it's not a huge restaurant - and I think having a group of 20 something people arrive and order at once would throw any small, independent restaurant off.   Service was as friendly as could be - but it is difficult for 2 servers to handle 20 hungry and thirsty patrons. Arrival of dinners was poorly spaced - by the time the last person got her plate, the first people were done. Sides and tortillas came very late. The food itself was somewhere between decent and good. I have no complaints, but wasn't really wowed by anything I tried.  I can see the diamond in the rough quality here - and I have friends that love it - so I will be back with just a small group (4 tops) to see what a \"normal\" dinner is like.",

I ordered a water of jamica w/o ice as I took a sip to my disappointment it was warm. Now I ask myself shouldn't fresh fruit water drinks be placed in ice or the refrigerator to avoid contamination? So for my meal I had the shrimp ceviche plate and as I took a bite of my tostada all I could taste is the staleness of the tostada and saltiness of the civiche and I am one who LOVES salt. The shrimp definitely was not fresh (I wonder if it may have been canned?). So I brought it to the waitress attention that the saltine crackers and tostadas were stale. She informed me that the restaurant was aware of this. Now why would a 4 1/2 star restaurant serve stale food to their customers?

I am not a fan of cheese on top, only because my doctor will probably have it out with me due to bacon alone, so I simply wiped it off. I must say, it was really good.

My husband and I were in PHX for a short vacay and after standing in the Hertz rental car line for 40 freaking minutes, I told him we are not going to Chino Bandido but the closest Mexican restaurant we can find on Yelp with the highest ratings.  Lo' and behold, it was Mariscos Playa Hermosa!  Literally 2 miles from the airport and easy to find.    We are so glad that we were able to find the best Mexican food we've ever had while in PHX, but it was hard having this as our first meal of the trip.  Every meal after this was just not cutting it.  Therefore, we planned the last day of our trip around the fact that Mariscos Playa Hermosa closed at 8pm on Sundays.   You really can't go wrong with the menu.  The first time, I ordered Fish Enchiladas and my husband ordered the Garlic Fish platter.  Both were amazing.  Their complimentary ceviche tostada was also delicious, as well as their salsas.   The 2nd time we went, I ordered the Camarones Culichi and my husband ordered another fish dish w/ vegetables.  Both were amazing again.  However, if you go here I would highly recommend the Camarones Culichi.....just because it's not something you find  at any mexican restaurant.  It was so delicious that I licked the plate of sauce clean after eating all of the shrimp, and I don't care how uncouth that might have looked because you will probably end up doing the same.  (Now, if you cannot handle spicy foods, you may want to be very cautious.  Maybe order an Horchata drink to go with the meal, or a side of sour cream to buffer the spiciness.)  Anyway, I don't want to hype it up too much or you might be disappointed.",

I followed the recommendation of other yelpers and ordered the shrimp culichi, very good choice.  My husband had the Torito de camaron, a yellow chili filled with shrimp, even better choice than mine.  The salsas were so good, the tomatillo one had enough spice for me.  I can handle spice, the red one was great too, however a bit too spicy for me this week.  Maybe another time I might enjoy it more.  My husband loved it.  We also had the shrimp meatball soup, very well seasoned and delicious. BTW I loved their corn tortillas and they told me they get them at the Sonorense.  They were fresh and cooked to perfection.  I dipped them in the green salsa, YUM. The margaritas are ok, but I was really here for the food.",

I went with the advice of a previous yelper and ordered the molcajete. And she was right, it truly was a volcano of food. Chicken, steak, fish and shrimp all surrounding a bubbling green sauce that's so good you want to drink it. Beans, rice, salads and fresh tortillas were served on the side, perfect for making your own little burritos. The complimentary ceviche tostadas were a nice touch and the green salsa was BUENO. The margaritas were really good too, although they were pretty small. All in all, it was well worth the drive and I can't wait to go back.   Note to late diners: they close at 8:00 :(",

Each meal starts with not only the customary chips and salsa, but an outstanding complimentary ceviche tostada. Favorites include Seven Seas Soup, Camarones Culichi, and of course their ceviche, which comes in several varieties. Most dishes come with beans and rice, but these are not the typical refried pintos and tomato-heavy rice typical of Mexican restaurants. Lovers of scorch-your-mouth spices should try the guacamole, which is heavy on the jalapeno. Portions are huge and service is outstanding.",

The only reason I'm giving a 4 is because I didn't love the salsas but everything else was amazing!  we ordered the shrimp ceviche to start (fresh and very tasty) and chorizo queso.   Came out still bubbling from kitchen on a cast iron grill...soooo good with their tortilla chips!  Because we ordered 2 apps, we split an entree (didn't want to leave with leftovers as we were going shopping for a few hours after).  We ordered the shrimp caramon culichi with a mix of corn and flour tortillas.  I usually don't order flour tortillas but glad I did (based on another yelper rec), soft and not too thick or doughy.  Everything was fresh and came out super fast!!  We also received a free coconut cake slice for checking in on Yelp....Their cake is probably the best white cake I've ever had!! It ended the meal perfectly and was a good size portion to split! I will definitely be back! Thanks so much for an amazing, authentic Mexican meal! Keep up the good work!!",

They also gave each of us (X4) a complimentary pescado y camerones ceviche tostada, . Delicious!!  We had the oysters, ceviche, camerones fantisima, and the Mar y Tierra and Barbacoa Enchiladas.... ALL AMAZING! In addition, we tried the Mexican Mule, Stawberry Margarita and house margarita, also delicious. Service was fast, fresh and wonderful. The portions are large and filling.  This is our new favorite place, so we will be back often.",

    "text": "Fine Mexican seafood cuisine! Try the molcajete with Diabla (red sauce). It's very spicy and hot. Caution! It's is not for the faint of heart. The molcajete is served piping hot and comes with carne asada, chicken asada, shrimp, sea bass, side of white fluffy rice, beans and salad.  We go often so it's nice to be greeted by senor Hector each time we visit. The ambience is quite festive, decorated in bright traditional Mexican style and it's a pretty loud environment so you may occasionally find yourself yelling at each other while trying to have a casual conversation. The environment wouldn't be Mexican if people weren't yelling across the tables. Lol!  I have never had bad service in this place and I've never been told no when I modify my order.  If I don't want rice and beans but instead ask for the plate to be full of salad they gladly oblige. You won't be disappointed with the food and service here.  I really want to try something else off their menu but I always end up ordering the same thing.   Maybe next time I'll venture off and order another dish.",

They had no trouble accommodating out late request and provided exceptional service. The staff was very attentive and food was wonderful as always. I would highly recommend this establishment for get-togethers.  Parking in front is limited, but there is a reserve lot just a few steps away. Overall, this is a great place to stay local and break away from chain restaurants.",

No one has ever had anything but good things to say about their meals.  The food here is the real deal and made with a lot of love. Where else do you get peas, carrots and green beans in your rice (unless your Mom made it). You get plenty of chips, fresh made salsa and complimentary ceviche tostada with your entree. My sister who will not eat Sushi even enjoyed her ceviche. I've ordered it to go many times.    My favorite is the Pescado Ala Talla (pronounced Taiya). If you're on a diet, skip it. But if you love fresh, lightly fried fish with a wonderful white sauce that has mushrooms, shrimp and octopus, then this dish is for you! Portions are very generous. The octopus is tender and cooked to perfection, never rubbery. Sorry, I was hungry and forgot to take a photo. You will have to try for yourself.  I keep meaning to try the shrimp cocktail which looks like a Bloody Mary with shrimp but never have room for it. Next time...  The moon and stars would have to be out of alignment for you to have a bad experience at MPH. Wait staff is very friendly and accommodating every single visit. Often times I come alone and never treated any different than a larger party. They know how to run a restaurant!  Even tho I was stuffed I had a bite of the carrot cake. Delish!!!",

Rice and side salad weren't great (but that's coming from someone who rarely eats Mexican rice- just not enough flavor and too many carbs). The Cadillac margarita was tasty too. And, did I say it was little? Well I meant it- the interior dining room is tiny. Just something to note if you have a large party. Looking forward to dining here again!",

I'm in my 30s and the other folks in their 60s retired.  I did most of the ordering and talking w/ the server and I handed the card to the server even before I got the check to show the staff that I am taking care of the bill.  However, once I got the final bill for about $160 (which was fine by me), written In big words and highlighted, they wrote:  TIP IS NOT INCLUDED - and highlighted the suggested amounts.  I find this rather offensive to write this.  I am already picking up the tab for the entire party and it was not necessary to write that on the check.  I always tip at least 20% even as high as 35%.  Nevertheless, I still tipped a little over 20%, but why they needed to highlight tip is not included is beyond me.  Maybe its because we are asian and my group consisted of seniors - but I hate to throw the race card in this review.. Oh wait.. I just did! haha!  Food is great and even the server was great  but this note on bill ruined the experience.    I just hope this does not happen to any other diner... I care about the people!",

I have written couple of reviews on this place and every time I come here, I walk away extremely happy!  It really doesn't get better than this.  They recently remodeled their restaurant, they now have more seating, re-did the bathrooms, and they now include a full bar!  This place is awesome!  Ambiance-  Once you walk into this restaurant you are taken away by the bright colors, vibrant atmosphere and the great smelling food!  You will notice how clean the place is and how friendly the staff is.  This place is a family owned restaurant and the owners are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  Jose and Maria are wonderful people and will always welcome you.  Food-  This is what it's all about right?  The food is the main attraction and they have some of the most delicious food I've ever tasted.  I am a huge fan of seafood and this place has some of the best!  I have sampled many dishes here, but what has me always coming back is the fresh oysters, fried fish, ceviche, and their amazing sauces that they make.  Give this place a try if come to Phoenix, cause trust me, this is where all the locals go to eat.  Hands down, one of the best establishments I've been to!",

    "text": "Three trips has not disappointed yet.  the interior atmosphere is spot on to a number of places I have been to in Central America.  The decor, the service, the atmosphere.  I have had very attentive waitresses each time.    The chips and salsas are very nice(ok one humid weekend I thought the chips were a bit stale).  One dip is a darker red salsa (smoked chillis?)  the second one is my favorite it is green cilantro and avocado dip.  It is so good I have purchased some to take home for later (ask the waitress - even comes iwth chips).  The first two times I ordered a whole fried fish ajillo, covered in sauteed garlic, peppers and onions.  It was very authentic just as I had eaten many times down south.  The rice and beans are as expected, not fantastic not dry and tasteless like other places.  Note - I did not come for rice and beans ;-).  Once my wife ordered the Camarones Culichi Shrimps In A Green Sauce, Tomatill & Cilantro, which was excellent.  The waitress recommended it and she was right.  The sauce seems to have some cheese mixed/melted in that made it sinfully savory.  Another time I ordered tacos al pastor.  OK, I know it is a seafood shop but after the nice ceviche I was ready for some flesh.  The tacos were very good. I liked how their al pastor was crispier than some.  Maybe a personal preference, but they were good.  Key note for me - they offer a variety of margaritas.  I prefer the upcharged one where they mix it themselve, not the premix bottled one. (they sell both)  for me it is less sweet and has a cleaner appeal.    I am planning on going back again next week when more family come to visit.  Last note:  The neighborhood is not the greatest.  I come from a tougher city so it was no big deal to me, but some others might appreciate being warned.",

There quality is very consistent and I would be soooo sad if they ever stop their business.  Let me give them 10 stars out of 5.  They are that good!  Please don't be discouraged because of the area it's in.  I know some people would never come to this part of town...they are missing out!    I love walking into the restaurant to their colorful decors.  Once you are seated, you will get a generous portion of freshly made warm tortilla chips with a red and a green salsa, no questions asked.  They don't care if you're going to order later on...here, have some chips and salsa!  They have a full bar and a TV with sports playing all the time.  Now you can have some drinks with free chips and salsa while watching a game.  Once you order, they will bring you a tostada with ceviche.  It's on the house.  Their ceviche is fresh and flavorful without being overpowered by excessive lime.  As for entrees, I would recommend.... - shrimp culichi - fish tacos - grilled shrimp - fried fish in garlic sauce - molcajete - any types of ceviche  Most dishes come with a side of beans, rice, salad, and flour/corn tortillas.  Be prepared to walk out with a full belly plus some to take home.",

    "text": "So we pull up and the first thing we see are 2 Phoenix police cars -- SCORE!  You know cops always know where to find good food!  LOL.    This place is fantastic!  After only one visit, I'm rating it a conservative 4-stars, but I can easily see upgrading to 5-stars after a few more visits.  The food is the star here.  We ordered the ceviche with fish and shrimp to start, and it was well-balanced and fresh!  One ingredient didn't overpower the others.  It's served with adorable tostada rounds versus chips, but you can always use your chips they automatically deliver to each table also.  Neither my BF nor I were super hungry, so we both ordered tacos -- I ordered the shrimp tacos and he ordered the fish tacos, and then of course we shared because, well, that's what we do.  I'm always hesitant to have my tacos served with cheese already served on them, but I'm so glad I didn't order cheese on the side!  My tacos were in toasted flour tortillas (they normally come with corn tortillas, but I asked for flour) and had the perfect amount of melted cheese holding the sides together.  Just thinking about them makes my mouth water.  The pinto beans served with the tacos are also really flavorful.  (They're also served with some greens, but I didn't eat them -- who has time for salad?)  With a Yelp check-in, you get a free slice of cake, so we ordered the coconut cake. OH-EM-GEEEE!  This is literally the best coconut cake I have ever had in my life!  The flavor of the coconut really shines through and is not diluted by sugar or cake.  Neither of us could believe how good it was.  Even as we were getting up to leave, my BF was scraping the plate clean of the rest of the cake. LOL, greedy self!  The only possible area for improvement are the margaritas.  I initially ordered just a house margarita and my BF ordered the mango margarita.  Although the flavor was good in both drinks, the tequila was lacking.  I'm not trying to get lit off of one margarita, but I should feel a little something. LOL.  But we both ordered the Cadillac margarita as a second drink and that one was WAY better!  Next time I'll just start with that one.   All in all, a pretty great experience, and I look forward to going back to try more items (and get some more coconut cake)!",

My daughter had a sea bass grilled and my son ordered a chille relleno. My wife ordered a carne asada fajita. Then we ordered a Molcajete Caliente for 2. This comes in a stone bowl with green sauce and cheese. It has shrimps, fish, carne asada and chicken. All hung on the hot stone bowl like a shrimp coctail!! Needless to say we all were eating each others food!! It hits your taste buds from every direction!! Yum!! We thought we would finish the meal with a flaan. How wrong we were! We just had to order another one. It was so delicious. The quantity is right up there with the quality. We had to pack up the left overs to go. There is no way I was going to let one ounce of this feast go waste. The service was exceptional. Our hostess/server was there like a genie. Water glasses were filled before they got empty, hot tortias appeared by magic, lime when requested materialised. Even when we awkwardly spilled a glass of water, it was soaked dry with a smile. I wish I could have this meal more often. I know that every time I come to Phoenix, they will have to deal with me!!  :-) :-).",

    "text": "So my husband and I were looking for someplace to celebrate our anniversary. We both love seafood and found this place. It reminded us of the first time we went to Mexico together so many years ago. The chips and salsa, especially the green salsa (in my opinion) were very good. We shared the molcajete and it was so very delicious. The green salsa in the middle is extremely tasty. I have no idea what is in it, but I would eat it again. The hubby had the $5 mug of Tecate and I had a Corona margarita. We definitely plan to come back!! The service was attentive and helpful, since it was our first visit I asked a lot of questions and our waitress was patient! Can't wait to go back!",

I take a book, sit in back and people watch while creaming my \"Make Me Yelp\" panties as I eat my culichi.  It's D I V I N E!  Eat the shrimp with a fork but you sure as Hell better use a spoon to destroy the rest of the bowl and leave it clean! Everything is fresh and the wait staff is loaded with recommendations.  Ask, and ye shall find.  The snapper Veracruz is so good I often order 2 and take one home.   The decor is fun - aquatic scenes that won't make you feel guilty for eating the seafood in front of you.   At Xmas they had a Santa at the door!  The people here a super-friendly!   They have their own parking lot.  You know it's a good place when yours isn't the fanciest car in the parking lot.  All kinds come here, despite the neighborhood not being the nicest in DoPho.  You can't miss it - even though I do pass it every time!  I think I'm too excited thinking of the shrimp culichi and my mouth is watering so much that I always manage to say \"Crap, passed it again!\" Go.  Just go to this place.  You won't be disappointed.  I swear.  And, you won't break the bank.",

    "text": "At 1 PM, we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices. Only one seafood entree (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.    Entrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a nice surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable. My fish had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.    It's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.  Service seemed friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt.   Judging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back. Two stars for the ceviche.",

The atmosphere is warm and cozy, yet also festive.  The prices are extremely reasonable, especially given the quality of the food and the complimentary ceviche before the main entree.  Absolutely everything was delicious.  This place should be packed on a Saturday night, although it's okay with me if just a few people know about this culinary gem.

    "text": "My husband and I visited MPH last night after reading some great reviews on Yelp. This place did not disappoint.  The decor inside MPH is colorful and welcoming. Nothing to special, but nice. We were sat immediately and our drink orders taken. The reviews of the chips and salsa have not been exaggerated. The chips are thicker, almost softer and deliciously warm and salty. The red salsa has a nice rich, spicy flavor, but the green salsa, oh, the green salsa. The green salsa is avocado and cilantro based. It has a wonderful fresh, almost tangy flavor that is complimented well by the creaminess the avocado brings to the dish. When our drinks arrived my husband was delighted by the icy mexican coca-cola, as was I. Our waiter also brought out a fish ceviche tostada. Though it was a surprising treat the ceviche was not a flavorful as we had hoped.   While we enjoyed the chips and salsa we could hear and smell our entree being freshly prepared. With out waiter suggestion we ordered the Molcajete. Which is essentially a sampler of grilled sea bass, shrimp, chicken, beef and octopus all swimming and sizzling in a tasty tomatillo based sauce. All the meats were fresh, tender and very flavorful. The rich green sauce was delightful. The bubbling cauldron of flavor was accompanied by flour tortillas that were tasty, but most importantly had a great texture for sopping up all the sauce, yum. Also included were some decent creamy pinto beans and fluffly white rice with what seemed to be veg-all mixed in. Mu husband loved the rice, I was less impressed and opted to fill up on everything else.  I can not leave this review with out mentioning the amazing guacamole. Freshly made, and the perfect amount of chunkiness. Some of the best gauc I have had recently.   Our bill was an even 40 after tax and tip and we left with some delicious left overs.   Overall this place is great, delicious, fresh, and affordable with very friendly service.",

The atmosphere is warm, festive and neighborly, no pretensions and the prices reflect this. There is a full bar, huge draft beers with lots of lime, and very hospitable service.

We started with two different types of cerviche, shrimp and fish, both with a nice mix of veggies and spices.  We then asked for a split bowl of the seven seas soup, which they willingly split. The two split bowls were almost as much soup as one regular bowl.  As advertised, there were seven types of seafood combined with a few vegetables and was delicious.  After almost having a full meal already we opted  for a the fish with poblano.  We also requested double salad  instead of beans and rice, and again were accommodated.  The base was very lightly breaded and topped with a mixture of poblano pepper, tomato, and onion, which blend nicely with the fish.  The server was very pleasant, helpful, and checked with us at the right times.  When the bill was presented we were amazed by the low total.     The atmosphere, service and food were all top notch.

The whole grilled fish was very good as was the breaded fish fillet. The crab enchiladas were horrible. The sauce tasted burnt and the crab meat had a very fishy taste. The side dishes were all the same: rice and beans and small salad. The rice and beans were tasteless and bland. The salad was iceberg lettuce and not much more. We may come back for the ceviche and to try some of their other entrees. The cost of most of the entrees is around $13-$14. The best part of the evening was the large supermarket we discovered , just before I -10, it has a large food court, ceviche bar, Mexican bakery and all sorts of specialty items used in Mexican, Carribean, and Latino cooking.

Then, after you order, you are served a complementary fish cerviche, which is quiet tasty. We ordered the fried Tilapia,  the shrimp in green sauce, and the shrimp with peppers. All came with beans, rice, and a salad on the side. The fried Tilapia was quite large, it could feed at least 2 people. The outside was very crisp and the inside tender and steamy. The shrimp in green sauce was like a soup, and it was very good, creamy and the shrimp was tender, The shrimp with peppers were excellent also and were served with tortillas (wheat tortillas or corn tortillas, your choice.)",

Would have been 5 stars but the only 4 shrimp came with it and they looked a bit lost on the large plate. Draft beer at $3 is a real bargain.  Service was helpful and quick.  HOW do they get the food out so quickly?  Place was nearly empty both nights. If this place was in a suburban strip mall, the line would be out the door.  Do yourself a favor and go.

Our food was delicious and SO incredibly fresh!! A surprise from a non-coastal region. I ordered the Seven Seas Soup and in addition to it being chocked-full of seafood, the broth was flavored to perfection! The ambiance was festive and nicely decorated, very clean, and the staff, friendly, attentive and professional. Great place - don't miss it if you are looking for an unusually nice, casual and very reasonably priced dining experience!",

A wonderful friendly atmosphere and all of the chairs and tables were hand painted in Mexican folk art. The place was immaculate.  We had called for a reservation for 12 people and our table was ready for us and we were immediately offered chips, 2 types of salsa and waters.  There were so many wonderful things to try on the menu that we all ordered something different. After we ordered we were given some of the best cevichi I have ever as an appetizer (no charge)!  Even though the kitchen had to prepare 12 different plates, they all came out together.  EVERYTHING was very carefully made and delicious. By far some of the finest Mexican food in the valley. We travel in Mexico often and have had many wonderful meals there. Imagine going to 16th street and Roosevelt for something even better.  The service was VERY friendly and timely. It felt like we were eating at my Grandmother's house!  Hands down, my new favorite Mexican Restaurant",

We both got ceviche apps, which were pretty good.  I had a fish filet & my BF had the dish with chicken, shrimp and beef (forget what it's called).  I found the food to be pretty salty, which I can't stand.  My fish was swimming in some kind of liquid, which totally turned me off & the salad it came with was drowned in some kind of yellow Italian dressing (Wish Bone out of the bottle?  not sure).  My BF's dish was ok at best...the beef was chewy & the shrimp & chicken were salty.  I hate to be so harsh, but I gotta call 'em as I see 'em.  Would def. not return.",

My husband had the octopus rancheros - he proclaimed it delicious. Both were served with rice, lettuce salad, and beans. The beans were much better than the usual.  We were too full for dessert, should have shared the shrimp cocktail.  House red wine was good and prices were reasonable.

It's almost 30 miles one way and I would do the drive a couple times a week for the food, service and friendliness We were taken care of from the time we entered right up to leaving. The \"on the house\" appetizers are are excellent. I like the red and my wife liked the green so much she had it put in our take home. We shared the Molcajete Catiente Mix and had enough take home for a late dinner. My beans and rice were the first empty plate and I know I had two loaded plates from the bubbling Mix bowl. The Mix sauce was so good I put it on my rice and could have made a meal from just that and the beans. I had a little trouble getting Yelp to come up,on my cell, but they had already taken our order for the complimentary \"Yelp  cake\". If you haven't tried a Tres Leche Cake you will want to make sure and order a slice here. My wife's chocolate cake was top notch too.

I wouldn't be surprised if Dora or the whole Sesame Street Gang suddenly showed up.  We ordered the Molcajete and fish ceviche. The Molcajete ($22) is the bomb! It's this delicious dish that has beef, chicken, shrimp, and fish lined up around on what seems like the Wicked Witch's cauldron filled with tomatillo sauce. It's enough for two people. You'd know its one of their popular dishes because all the other tables have it. One group of people even ordered three! It's like we were part of a Mexican witch convention. It was pretty amusing.  My husband got the $4 draft beer which he later regretted because there's this promo girl who gave out some freebies including a bottle of Budweiser beer for each of us. I'm not sure if they do that all the time. I guess we're just lucky. We went on a Friday night so we got a live background music from their Mariachi band.  Overall, we loved it! Can't go wrong with Mexican seafood. We'll definitely be back.  Trivia: Apparently, the Molcajete is the traditional Mexican version of mortar and pestle. Thanks Wikipedia!",

    "text": "hmmm I must say I was a little disappointed after driving 45 minutes to eat here. I saw it reviewed on a popular local TV Show and it looked awesome so decided to give it a try.  First the parking lot was really small/tight so that made it a challenge. The place was very much smaller inside than it looked on TV as well. Your table chair up against another tables chair small. You couldn't easily get in and out without hitting other diners.  As far as service they were nice enough but after taking our order we didn't see our server very often. Had to ask for menus and after we received our food we had to ask for silverware. It was said on the show everyone get a small sample of the ceviche. We did not. We did get chips and salsa as well as a tomatillo green sauce. While not bad the chips and sales was not that good either. They did not give small plates or anything so the chip went into the sauce then straight to your mouth. Kind of sloppy.  For an app we had seafood cocktail. It was large and pretty good with lots of different kind of shrimp, octopus, fish etc. They didn't scrimp on the seafood but at $18.00 each I would hope not! It was served with saltines which I also thought is kind of weird for a Mexican restaurant.  For entrees we had a spicy shrimp dish and crab enchiladas. The spicy shrimp was good. Smothered in a red sauce it was a little hard to eat since they left the tail shell on and it was hard to remove and eat because it was smothered in the sauce. Not sure how you were expected to pull it off?  The crab enchiladas were not good to me at all and had a weird smell. I only ate two bites and was done. Overall damage approached $70 for two people and I left hungry. I love Mexican food i guess just not Mexican seafood.",

    "text": "I'm in love. The festive decor charmed me the second I walked in the door. We sat down and were immediately greeting by a sweet waitress carrying a basket of chips. The chips were light and fresh and came with two salsas, a red and a green avocado salsa.  We ordered: Camarones aguachile hot drowned shrimp, Camarones culichi shrimps in a green sauce,tomatill & cilantro, rezongue enchiladas crab enchiladas in a red sauce. I also ordered a club soda and when the waitress asked if I wanted it prepared mexi style I said yes. What she brought back was a delicious mix of club soda, salt and muddled lime. It's my new favorite drink.   We patiently waited for our meal and remarked on the little mermaid scene in front of us. I almost expected the crustaceans to come to life and start playing music.  Then to our surprise little fish tostadas were dropped on our table. What a nice touch! The dishes were excellent, all were paired with homemade tortillas, beans and white rice with vegetables.  The camarones culichi was my favorite.  Fresh seafood, fun atmosphere, great service.",

    "text": "It's another beautiful sunny Arizona morning after an evening of birthday festivities...which after seeing \"Check Please\" was celebrated here at  Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  We were a party of 10 with a reservation and ready to sample what appeared to be some great seafood!  The restaurant is small with lots of beautiful colors and wooded tables with authentic chairs and I felt like I was in Mexico!  The atmosphere was a bit chaotic ... Although they were not super busy they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off... BTW... Today's special.... Chicken! ... NOT!   In reading previous reviews... The biggest complaint is the service... Or lack of it!  Boy oh boy... They were not kidding!  Why o why do they not have ample employees?  Or at least experienced ones?   HEY OWNER... Do yourself a favor... HIRE SOME EMPLOYEES!!  Moving right along... The place is small so you can imagine it would be loud... Which it was... but that's ok.. Made it feel more festive!  It took forever to just get water and for 10 people they gave only 2 bowls of chips and tiny saucers of hot sauce... Water glasses and drink refills RARELY happened!  We tried many item between all of us.  The larger whole fish was moist and delicious! This was the best part of the evening!  They served their complimentary ceviche which was enjoyable and might I add... A nice touch!  The shrimp and fish in garlic sauce... Let's talk about that for a sec....  Ok, just the other day I cooked some shrimp on the Barbie bathed in butter/garlic. Mine was equally as good if not better because my shrimps were larger.  They use a medium shrimp that's tasty but nothing the average Joe can't make themselves... The fish part of the dish was a saturated fried piece...   Didn't try the rice simply because it looked unappetizing and did not care for the beans... I related them to baked beans... Like in hot dogs and beans... That's the initial taste.  We also tried the crab enchiladas ... Again not impressed... It was filled with crab meat but did not care for the taste ... Nor did anyone at the table.  The tortillas were tortillas nothing special.  Back to the service...I don't want to hear excuses like \" it was very busy\" because according you all those 5 star reviews( which I just don't get) you should expect it to be super busy on a Saturday night!  One end of the table was almost finished by the time the other end got their food... The servers had absolutely no idea who had what so she pretty much passed the plates and we figured it out ourselves!    I had to ask for all the dirty dishes to be taken away as nobody came to take them.  On to dessert...they knew we were there for a Birthday and we had to remind them several times.  For the birthday girl they give a piece of cake and she chose \" tres leche cake\" the cake was unlike any Tres Leche I have had.. Had a raspberry? Filling and did not taste very leche... I am no expert at this but the ones I have tried sit in the leche which absorbs into the cake making it somewhat soggy and delicious... This was different ...  I am sure there are many different kinds but it was not a hit at the table...  So, they have this other deal... Where they bribe you to YELP a reviews using names of servers and when they confirm it was posted they give you a piece of coconut cake...so one of the kids at the table did it...  I must say...the coconut cake was delish! Very moist and lots of coconut!  Getting the check was another challenge and when we did get it they charged for 3 items of which we only had 2....  Really makes me wonder... Between the REVIEW BRIBES and the mistakes on the check.... How much money they make this way?  Since we live nowhere close the chances of any of us returning are slim ...  On goes my quest to find some great Mexican food!  I imagine when a restaurant knows they are going to be on TV they make sure everything tastes great and service is great...  But on any other day you see how it really is... Don't believe everything you see on TV  It is a cute place and the fish was good... Give it a try... See what you think!  Never base a decision on one persons review... Food is a preference and I am very tough critic!    Bon Appetite'",

    "text": "I'm gonna have to join all the 5-star reviewers.  This place is TOTALLY AWESOME !!  (forgive my usage of the cliched 80s standby, but this applies here !!)   Everything was just about right.  The service was prompt and helpful. The salad was fresh and crispy. The rice was filled with little chunks of green beans and carrots and I think corn too. The refried beans were not overly fatty nor were they overly salty. The guacamole was chunky and tasty, with BIG chunks of avocado. The corn tortillas were light, soft, and fresh. The Shrimp culichi sauce was so good that I was eating it with a spoon. The Negra Modelo on tap in a 28-oz glass for $3 was a super-bargain and Oh So Cold and Yummy. The chips were hot and fairly thick and a little oily - top notch. The red salsa was smokey and had a bit of kick. The green tomatillo/avocado salsa was about the best I've had in town. OH YES I ALMOST FORGOT:  They gave me an \"on the house\" Ceviche tostada, and it was the BEST Ceviche I have EVER tasted.  I don't normally like it, but this was SCRUMPTIOUS.  Can't wait for tomorrow to munch on the leftovers.  This place is not only a great Mexican SEAFOOD restaurant - it's about as good as any REGULAR Mexican restaurant in town.  Miss out on trying this place? That would be a bad move.",

As soon as you walk you'll notice the place is fully decorated with Mexican/ Latin theme. The place was busy and the smell made you believe that you were going to walk out satisfied. The serves were so friendly, they helped us pick out some great items off the menu. We started with the choriqueso which was a hot place filled with cheese and topped with chorizo and jalapenos. For lunch, I had the fish ceviche- a very light dish filled with flavor of lime, onions, and cilantro- was a big hit! My dude had the popular burrito with carne asada, a dish definitely enough for 2. You'll be amazed just by watching the dishes that are served to others eating at the restaurant. I'd absolutely return here and recommend this place to anyone whose looking for a mixture of seafood and Mexican quinine.",

Some may consider it a bit small for the eating area I call it quaint and colorful. You feel like you are in a real mariscos down in puerto Vallarta (w/o ocean view of course). I prefer Camerone (shrimp) and this place has got it down, so Tasty. I don't believe that you can order a bad plate here. The food presentation is also decent on your plate. There is also Pescado (fish), steak and chicken if you prefer non seafood that day. Avocados are fresh and the staff are friendly and quick to take care of you. The only bad thing about this place is that the parking is a bit small so arrive early for lunch or you'll have to park along the street. The portions are decent sized and very flavorful. I'd recommend this place to anyone - Yes anyone. Even my enemies lol. It's great enough to share.",

I will say though, most dishes sounded great so if that is your thing it's probably worth checking out.   The interior is colorful and they have many tables packed in there, so plenty of places to sit but feels a little bit like a maze trying to find your table and not run into those serving.   We were seated promptly and got our drink order in, plus chips and salsa. The salsa was awesome with a green and red option. Once we ordered, they brought out a ceviche tostado for each of us. Decent flavor and a nice touch.   I ended up ordering the al pastor tacos which came with rice and beans. The meat was delicious, plus the pineapple and onion complimented it as well. I really enjoyed them and the rice and beans were great as well. I would definitely rate these more of a 4 at least.   My girlfriend ordered the chicken enchiladas with the green sauce on the side. She said they were ok, but the chicken was pretty dry. Then again, she was eating them without sauce but she's gotten similar items without sauce elsewhere and the chicken has still not been too overdone. Either way it was average.   The service is what brought it down to a three for us. Our server was very nice and pretty attentive in the beginning, but once we ordered she was MIA until the check was dropped. Our drinks sat empty for more than half the meal as did our chips. We wanted to ask for refills but we literally didn't see her until we were ready to pay! Not sure what happened but overall, we had an average visit. Didn't stand out to me but again, perhaps the seafood is what does.",

We started with chips and salsa the red salsa was spicy just how I like it, then we received our beautiful drinks while waiting they brought us a complementary tostada de pescado.

I had the beef fajitas, which were pretty good, and the restaurant's decor was very beautiful. However, I was pretty disappointed in the margarita that I ordered. I got the Azul frozen margarita, which tasted watery and truthfully I am unsure if it had any alcohol in it. In addition, the drink menu has no prices on it, and while I assumed a margarita at a Mexican restaurant would cost about $8, I learned when I got the check that I was charged $12 for basically a virgin margarita. That is very overpriced, and the restaurant should be more candid about their drink prices.",

    "text": "As someone who doesn't love Mexican food, I sure loved Mariscos Playa Hermosa!   FOOD (5/5): The tacos were pretty cool. They come in orders of 4 and a bunch of toppings: beans, rice, onions, cilantro, red cabbage, limes, salsa, etc. When you order a bunch, they line it all up, creating a fun presentation. I ordered the tostada embarazada and I was super impressed with the value! It was filled with octopus, raw shrimp, cooked shrimp, topped with a couple slices of avocados. The waitress was nice and offered to get me half crackers and half mini tostadas chips (to get the best of both worlds). My significant other was concerned about fthe handling of the raw shrimps. It's been 24 hours and I am proud to say no food poisoning occurred.   SERVICE (6.5/5): I don't think I could say enough nice things about our waiter, Hassen A. is from Syria. He is truly the nicest, caring and most hardworking individual we've come across. He asked us if we needed to split the receipt, to get that squared away in the beginning. Despite it being super busy and having to bus a bunch of other tables, Hassen never forgot about us! He was able to provide our whole table with complimentary mini tostadas (perhaps it was later in the evening, or because it was our first visit, or maybe to keep us content while waiting?). Hassen was super personable and made sure we had an excellent meal and experience. He even offered to to take a second group photo for us after we received all of our food because he saw how I was being a total foodie. THANK YOU, YOU KIND SOUL. Unless you already have a favorite person, I definitely recommend asking for Hassen as your server. At one point, a man wearing an apron came out to ask the customers about their meal, I would assume he was the chef or owner. I appreciate and admire the extra effort and pride they take in their work.   ATMOSPHERE (5/5): It was a Sunday evening, so they had a live band. For anyone not familiar, it can be a bit loud, which wouldn't be ideal for a first date if you're hoping to have a conversation. There's also outside seating, but I wasn't sure if it would have a bit chilly for some folks. I loved the colorful decoration inside and dreamy lights outside. The music makes for a fun and lively experience (but I would check with the restaurant ahead of time about the schedule if you were looking for a place with minimal background noise).  PARKING (3.5/5): Their little parking lot can get pretty full, but there is another parking area across the street, behind this laundry mat. You will definitely find a spot, but I want to warn you that it's not well lit in the evening. Just a warning for anyone traveling alone because it could be a bit sketchy.  DEALS (5/5): Don't forget to check-in on Yelp for a free slice of cake! I saw on the menu that for desserts, they offer flan, carrot cake, coconut cake, and chocolate cake. Our waiter brought us a pretty nice piece of chocolate cake!",

Inside this place is beautiful, it took me right back to Mexico. When we came in we kinda knew what wanted, definitely had to get the fried red snapper. We also ordered a couple ceviche tostadas and two ceviche tostadas were provided complimentary.  We also ordered the Plato del Capitan and holy moly this was insane, so good. The shrimp was prepared like four different ways and they were all fantastic.  Back to the red snapper, it was sooooo good. Like so good! The fish was prepared perfectly, it was moist and it tasted amazing.  I've long searched for a great Mexican restaurant out here in Phoenix and I can finally say that I have found one. This place is exceptional.",

Had two micheladas and to be honest I usually don't order micheladas as I don't like them. I tried my husbands and I was impressed.   We shared a mocajete that was more than enough for the both us. It has beef, chicken, shrimp, and oysters inside, as well as fish. Also ordered the \"Toritos\" which are jalapenos (not regular jalapenos, not sure what it was) stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon. Cooked to perfection!!  For dessert: the flan -- this wasn't my favorite but it was still good.",

    "text": "LOCATION:  This restaurant is indeed in a part of Phoenix  (south of I-10) known to be a \"bad\" neighborhood.  This is no easy badge to earn, because, unlike most other cities, there aren't good neighborhood separated from bad ones:  Phoenix is one of the few cities I've ever been to, where you can have a million dollar home and two doors down from it is a crack house.  Bizarre, but True.  Having said that, I personally would not want to come here when the sun is down, but when we arrived at 6pm, it was quiet and I didn't feel uneasy about the surroundings.  PARKING LOT:  The entrance to the restaurant is off of Garfield and not 16th Street, which you'll be taking to get here.  This is important, because you'd think it would have an entrance to the parking lot from the main road; it doesn't.  The parking lot, like the restaurant, is small and they share it with a barber shop, which threatens to tow if you park in their spots.  Obviously, this is no problem after they close; but during business hours, I imagine it can be hard to find spots which \"belong\" to the restaurant.  THE RESTAURANT:  And, like the parking lot, the restaurant is small inside.  There aren't a lot of tables, so it wouldn't take much to fill up the place.  The decor is typical \"Mexican\":  lots of colors, nature motifs, sombreros, etc.  It may be jarring for some conservative Anglo types, but they more than likely wouldn't come here anyway.  The pinks, blues, greens, yellows and other colors so typical of the Mexican Pacific seem to blend nicely and don't seem garrish at all.  Now, as I said, the place is small.  So, for example, someone sitting at the table behind me actually had to pass next to my table to get to their seat.  Not a big deal and she politely excused herself twice.  This might be unacceptable in a 3 or 4 star restaurant or even something simply \"formal\".  But the atmosphere in this place is far from formal.  It's friendly, loud, noisy and familiar.  If you don't like people and if you're uptight about someone walking past you while you're eating, you won't like this place.  If you're there to enjoy the food, have a good time with friends, or don't mind a lively atmosphere, you'll do fine here.  That being said, I believe, I read somewhere that they have live Mariachi music on Fridays.  I'm not a fan of the genre, but even if I were, as small as that place is, I have a strong feeling it would be very LOUD while the music was being performed.  There are two TVs in the place, which, typical for this kind of venue, were playing soccer.  They were not loud and did not intrude on personal conversations.  The place also seems to have a full bar and a number of beer specials.  THE FOOD:  Being older and having to bring in my reading glasses, one of the things I very much appreciated about the menu was each item being listed in Spanish and English, with Spanish written in blue and English in yellow ink.  This made it much easier to separate the two and quickly see what was what.  I ordered a fish combo which was supposed to come with octopus and shrimp and with a creamy mushroom sauce.  It was not a \"combo\" in the sense that most Americans would be used to.  I expected there to be some fish filet, some shrimp and some octopus.  What came was a fish filet covered in mushroom sauce with some shrimp and very tiny pieces of octopus mixed in.  My companion had a less expensive fish filet with garlic sauce.  Outside of the different price and the cream sauce, they looked exactly the same.  Nevertheless, while this might sound negative, I was not at all disappointed with my plate.  My companion thought his fish greasy; I think it was the garlic sauce.  My fish was not at all greasy and tasted wonderful.  The food was served hot, but not so hot as to burn you.  The rice served with the fish was plain and nothing exciting; and yet, it complimented the fish perfectly.  The portions look huge and they are; but I didn't feel stuffed when I was done; just contented.  It was just the right amount of food.  I had oysters as an appetizer.  If you like oysters, they were good with the lime juice I squeezed on them.  If you don't, well, then it doesn't matter, does it?  The ceviche was okay; a lot of reviewers made a big deal about them in their reviews.  There was nothing bad about them; just nothing special.  Overall, we were both VERY happy with the food, the portion size, the temperature they were served at, and the taste ... and my partner usually complains about everything!  So this is a BIG endorsement!  THE SERVICE:  *sigh* ... Not everything can be perfect and this was the pebble amidst the pearls in the evening.  The service staff is friendly.  But the place is too small, has too many people  (on a Thursday night, no less ... can you imagine it on a Friday?!?); and not enough servers to be as attentive as they have to be.  Food and drinks were served promptly.  But when it came time to pay, I had to track them down.",

The rice was a little soggy and it was very tasteless, it was almost hard to eat to be honest. To finish it off the salsa was very watery and it felt like it was missing something. All In all, it was an alright spot I doubt we will be going back considering the long drive but I wouldn't count it out for good.",

One of the ingredient in the cocktail probably has seen its better days, cause it was unpleasantly fishy and bitter. Shrimp wrapped in Bacon (Shrimp Fantasia) was decent, but I had better at other places. 7 Sea soup was average, thought I think I will like it a lot more if the soup is served warmer than room temperature.   One last thing, Mexican cuisine usually pairs with tons of lime as garnish and flavoring especially when it comes to seafood. And almost all Mexican restaurants (or taco trucks) i been to seem to shared the talents of picking out the juiciest limes  that's ever grown. Well, not this place. One interesting I encountered today after decades of Mexican food experience was how dry their lime were. Most of them won't even budge one drop of juice for me. Wonder if that would make the difference for the cocktail or the soup?",

The Hunny and I had a dozen oysters (not a good choice but not bad any means)  We downed those with tapatio and fresh lime.   Then we had ceviche.  So good! I loved it. It was hearty with great lime sauce.   I had the fish tacos and he had shrimp and fish veracruz or something.  Both were good- did it taste like the freshest fish of all time? no.  Did I eat it anyways because it tasted like Baja California. Yup.   I really like this place.  They also have the fat boy's favorite mexican beer- bohemia.",

Camarones culichi... the sauce is pretty good! However, it was overpriced as hell.... it was a small bowl portion with 6 shrimps in a bowl of sauce and some cheese sprinkled on top. Way too expensive for a 15.99$   Oysters came out okay but to my surprised there was no cocktail sauce nor horse radish. It was only oysters and lime..... -_- you can imagine how fishy the taste is. 16.00$   Cocktail was good as last time. $15.99  We don't get complimentary ceviche this time :( I wonder why",

And if you like spicy foods, try the Diablo sauce.... boy, is it hot (but tasty).   The service really is unbelievably amazing. We had a couple of questions that our sever couldn't answer so she grabbed someone who could. They were also great about working with my wheat allergy (they definitely have a number of gluten free options).  I had the jalapeno margarita and sucked it down so quick I was actually amazed how good it was. I could barely taste the alcohol for a few minutes then quickly realized that it was, in fact, kind of potent... it had great flavor and a little bit of a kick (nothing too bad). We also got a Cadillac margarita, which was also tasty.   Our bill ended up being about $100 for three people (with six drinks). You can't beat that price anywhere.   Come here if you like great food, drinks and prices.",

They serve Mexican-styled seafood but does offer non-seafood options for those seafood haters. Options are numerous and diverse. I ordered a fajita during my first visit so I couldn't attest to all their seafood dishes. However, the options I tasted were well-constructed and tasty. They were very judicious in their use of lime, which I greatly appreciate. My boyfriend ordered the chicken fajita and even the chicken was on par.  The restaurant itself is rather small and interior is vibrant. They pack a lot of people into this place. There is no wasted space. There were a lot of people there, and our wait was about 20 minutes. Most people sat on the patio as they waited for a table. To access the patio, you have to first walk through the restaurant. It's an awkward set-up. The patio itself was pretty decent. They had umbrellas and misters which kept everyone cool. The bathrooms look like they're newly renovated and were very clean. Our server was very nice and helpful, but there was definitely a language barrier. I appreciated her effort to understand and communicate with us.",

Excellent customer service!    The parking lot is very very small, maybe can park 8 to 12 cars, but there is plenty of parking on the street, so that what I did, once inside the place is very colorful and inviting.  I ordered the 3 carne asada tacos with beans and rice. They were great street tacos perfect for what I was craving. The beans and rice were ok, over all it was a good dish and with tax included came in under 10 bucks! That's a great deal for dinner!    After everyone was done eating they brought us out 5 different types of cakes/dessert to try, chocolate cake, tres leches cake, coconut cake, cheese cake & flan. I'm a chocolate lovin fool and the chocolate cake was perfect, it was sweet, rich and full of chocolaty goodness, but my favorite I have to say was the Tres Leches Cake, that stuff was amazing! Also the coconut cake was great too!   I defiantly will be coming back to try a few other of their dishes for sure!",

    "text": "Came here because my boyfriend wanted mariscos and had raved about this place.  The seafood was really fresh and flavorful and the salsa that came with the chips was really good and spicy. This is where the positives end for me.  The service was extremely slow as it took over an hour to get our food. The server was apologetic though so I wasn't really super upset about the wait.   I ordered a Serrano margarita, which I thought sounded pretty cool. I'm a fan of spicy margaritas so I didn't think this would be a problem. It took about 10-15 minutes longer to receive than my boyfriend's michelada which should have been a red flag. I'm thinking maybe this isn't something people order often and the bar tender (who I think was also our server...I saw her behind the bar quite a bit) was scrambling to figure out how to make it.  What I got was nothing short of an abomination. It was really bad. It tasted like a Serrano pepper and some ice cubes went through a wood chipper and shot out the other end into a margarita glass. I couldn't taste any lime or tequila in it at all. Had my boyfriend try it and he said he'd never tasted anything like it and to send it back, which I did.    I told the server I didn't like the drink and her response was \"well Serrano peppers are spicy.\" Yeah, I know that. That's why I ordered it. *insert eye roll*  Went with a house margarita instead, which was good but tasted like it was from a mix. At least this left little margin for error.  When we got the bill, I was still charged for both drinks. The bill was an outrageous $100 for three drinks (my two margaritas and the michelada), an appetizer and two entrees. A man who I'm guessing was the manager had come by to drop off the check and ask how everything was, and I said it was fine prior to looking at the bill. Perhaps our server had sent him over to do damage control thinking I'd complain.  I've never sent anything back in a restaurant ever so I don't know how it works but I sure didn't expect to be charged for it. So if you eat here and don't like anything you eat or drink, you might as well finish it cause you'll be paying for it anyway. I just wanted to leave at this point so I paid the bill and made sure the tip I left was less than the amount of the $13 science experiment margarita I got, which is a shame because I normally tip well.   I don't plan on ever coming back here.",

Service was extremely slow, and the timing was awful, my husband got his meal served. He waited a good 10 minutes, before I begged him to eat. I was ready to tell the server to forget my entree, when it finally arrived 15 minutes later. ( hubby was finished with his meal.)  The food was so below average to say the least, that it was extremely irritating to pay $50 for our lunch. ( tostados, shrimp stuffed peppers, and 2 beers.    I had two or three bites, and I was ready to go!  So dissatisfied, and disappointed! Never Agian",

They served us fish  Ceviche tostada on the house. OMG that was so refreshing and yummy. It was a great surprise and random. Food kick off with a good start.  We ordered a few dishes to share and must say we are impressed with each of the dishes. I never knew how spicy Mexican food can be.   Grilled shrimps: it was cooked just perfect and the dipping sauce that came with the dish was so refreshing. The perfect amount of spice and citrus.  Fillet de pescado de la Diablo in hot red sauce. The dish is huge and best shared. The fish is meaty and cooked just right. Not overcooked or chewy and the sauce is a balance of sweet and sour. Never had this dish at any other Mexican restaurants before. Highly recommended.  Seafood Ceviche in this huge bowl of red sauce with octopus, scallops, shrimps, cucumbers, red onions and there were raw and cooked shrimps on top of the bowl. So delicious! Warning it's extremely hot.   My friend ordered draft Modelo and it came in this huge glass as big as a pitcher!   The mangolado was so perfect on a hot summer day.  Its a blended Mango drink with a shot of house tequila and tamarind. Try it you won't regret it.",

Great service and a great place for families. Wait staff wears regional Mexican outfits and the decorations are bright and colorful.

We made a reservation because we were a larger party. Well, when we got there, they said they were not currently accepting reservations. What?!?! So we waited 1 hour 40 min! I would think they would disable the reservation feature online or post an announcement on the home page not to try to make a reservation in an effort to keep customer service high.

It's a beautiful bright colored building, with colorful tiles and detailed paintings inside and out. They have a beautiful patio. We decided to sit outside, since they had misters, umbrellas, trees, and plants everywhere! Beautiful inside and outside decor and atmosphere.   We were greeted at the table with fresh fried homemade chips, and two types of salsa: red and green. My SO liked the green, I went for the red.   Our waitress was patient, funny, and hospitable! SO ordered a modelo, and we put in an order for their Ceviche de Camarone. We usually share everything we eat at restaurants, so for our entree, we figured the Molcajete Caliente. We went with the verde Culichi sauce and we did not regret our decision.   The Molcajete comes with: 3 pieces of carne asada,  6 pieces of grilled shrimp, 3 pieces grilled chicken, and 3 pieces fried fish. It also came with two plates of rice, beans, salads, and tortillas. Needless to say, we were stuffed by the end of our meal.   The ceviche came out first. It was seasoned perfectly, topped with avocado slices, and served with tostadas. We wanted to finish the ceviche so badly but we knew we had to save our appetites.   The chicken, shrimp, carne and fish were all cooked to perfection. Tender, incredibly flavorful, and the best part is dunking the meat in the sauce in the bowl. The sauce is a fish based sauce, with octopus and different fish inside. Don't let this scare you if you are a timid eater. Everything was cooked perfectly and the fish was incredibly fresh.   Our waitress came to check up on us, and we asked for more chips.... that's how damn delicious they were. Come here just for the chips and salsa if nothing else.   We checked in to yelp as well, and received a free slice of chocolate cake to end our meal. Even though we were stuffed we still somehow had room for a giant slice of decadent chocolate cake... that's usually how it goes, right?   You have the option of coconut, chocolate, and vanilla (I believe). Highly recommend checking in!   I can't wait to come back here.",

Upon arriving, it appeared to be a rather small place but the parking lot was filled and as soon as we walked in, it was packed.  Mariel was our server and greeted us promptly with a smile.  Salsa and chips were served immediately.  There was a green salsa and a red salsa.  The red was a bit hotter for us so we went through several bowls of the green salsa which was delicious.  Mariel brought us a sample of the seafood ceviche on a crispy corn tortilla.  It was amazing.  I ordered the three taco sampler plate with beans and rice.  The tacos were shrimp, beef and chicken.  All were amazing but I liked the shrimp and the beef the best.  My wife ordered the garlic shrimp and the butter sauce was out of this world!  They wouldn't share the secret on how they made it but it is a must try!  For dessert, we had a flan and a chocolate cake.  Both are homemade and delicious!  We are definitely going to try the red snapper next time.  We watched as about 10 people ordered this and it looked delicious and interesting.  This is a family owned business and the pride that the manager and owner Manual and team takes in the business shows well.  Nothing better than eating at a restaurant when it is full of happy people.  Say hi to Manuel when you are there.  His mom started this restaurant many years ago and he has continued the tradition.  Ask for Mariel too!  She was great and took good care of us.  If you are looking for a quiet place, this is not it.  We loved the energy!",

I wasn't feeling like seafood and I was pleased to find they had plenty to choose from.  The chicken burrito was huge.  The flavor felt as though they had taken the time to make it even though it wasn't their staple.    I also ordered a beer and when asked I went with the smaller size which was still ginormous when it came which was great!   My only call out is that we sat right next to the front door as there is no front of house stand.  Otherwise, though very much worth finding a parking spot to enjoy some fantastic Mexican flavors!",

Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar.  Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.    If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way.",

    "text": "Last summer my boyfrined and I started the Summer Ceviche Project, which was to visit all the Mexican seafood places that populate the southern part of the near-east side.  This was the first place we tried.  After 13 places, we stopped trying anything else.  This is literally the gold standard.  Not to say there isn't amazing ceviche in other places, or even great ceviches at trendier spots.  This is just what all ceviche needs to start its life as: shrimp, cucumbers, onions and tomato.  Slice of avacado on top, ample selection of hot sauces if you so desire.  (He does, I don't.)      If you want to add or create away from that basic recipe.  So be it.  It's been done nicely at loads of expensive trendy spots. (Scottsdale: Seriously, $10 for a tostada?) But if you do it this good, why in the world would you mess with it?  Back to MPH:  The tomatillo-avacado salsa is one of the biggest reasons I can never leave Phoenix.  I would literally crinkle up and die if I didn't get it once a week.  Just go.   It's seafood, so the regular menu is not \"cheap mexican.\"  BUT, nine times out of ten, I just go in for a beer, a ceviche tostada.  If we go during happy hour, two beers, two ceviche tostadas and chips and salsa will set me and the boy back $12.  During scorching summers, who wants any more food than that?  When it's 115 outside, getting a lovely, air conditioned place to sit, drink a beer, eat great food....and leave for under $20 for two people makes this a True find.  Last note: the place is freaking ADORABLE, the service is amazing, and if you go more than twice, they will start to remember you.  Which is nice.",

Eating at this modest restaurant was the culinary highlight of my trip to Phoenix.  I implore all Phoenicians to frequent this establishment and your taste buds will thank you.  For starters, the chips were wonderfully light and not too oily.  The chips come with two different types of salsa.  A red salsa with a little bit of a bite and a green avocado salsa that is mild with just the right hint of avocado.   I ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce and the dish was sublime.  The shrimp were sauteed with red bell peppers and onions.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly - not too soft and not too crunchy.  The garlic sauce was wonderfully sweet and garlicky.  I couldn't get enough of it.  My dining companions both ordered the Camarones Culichi.  This dish is freaking amazing!  It consists of shrimp cooked in a green tomatillo sauce and loaded with melted Manchego cheese.  The sauce is divine and words cannot describe it properly.    The perfect accompaniments to these dishes were Mexican Coca-Colas (Yay!), creamy beans topped with cheese, and white rice with vegetables.  The tortillas were right on and looked to be homemade.  Leave behind the comfort of the fancy pants restaurants that the trendinistas like to go to and try something real.  You will not be sorry.",

The place has a bit of a rep for crab enchiladas (there was a blurb in Gourmet a few years ago), but they may be one of the more bland things on the menu.   I'm going to second the idea that the shrimp dishes are a great way to fall for this place on the first visit. The camarones culichi are awesome, with a tomatillo sauce that should be distilled into bath salts. Snapper veracruz is delicious if you're looking to test one of the more typical preparations.   Oh -- This place isn't really that parking-sketchy (especially if you've experienced the Ranch Market demo derby up the street) and they have their own lot right in front.",

    "text": "Wow. I'm embarassed I didn't know about this place earlier. And I call myself a Phoenician?  I came here for dinner last night after reading the review by Sabrina, who ought to be awarded the Nobel Prize for something for discovering this place. I almost don't want to write this review because it'll spoil the surprises you're in store for when you visit.   It begins when you pull into the parking lot and eye the shady looking exterior, but then step inside. The owner has gone to great lengths to decorate with a unique theme of Mexican life on the sea. I was charmed the instant I opened the door.   The menu is your next surprise. Not one item on the first three pages is anything you've ordered before at any other Mexican restaurant. The dishes are all seafood based, including crab, octopus, and lots of shrimp. What says it all is the description on the last page of the menu that offers \"Mexican food\", where you can get the standard fare of cheese enchiladas etc.   What I say next I do not say lightly. As of right now, this place serves THE BEST, #1, salsa in the state of Arizona. This is based on a lifetime growing up in this state and sampling salsas hundreds upon hundreds of times at our best Mexican restaurants from Ajo to Tucson to Springerville. When my dinner companion told the owner how much she liked the salsa he remarked to us that it was a new recipe. There are actually two salsas that come with the chips, one a reddish green variety and the other being avocado-based. The avocado based one is also excellent, but it's the reddish green one that simply blows me away with its combination of flavor and just the right amount of spiciness. We wolfed it down so quickly he brought us a second bowl within minutes of our sitting down.   Our next surprise came after we ordered our entrees. The owner walked up to our table and put down two small plates of what I can only describe as seafood tostadas. This is evidently yet another free appetizer that comes with all meals. Picture a mini-tostada shell, on top of which is a well-marinated collection of what I think were tiny pieces of salmon, tomato, onion and green peppers. Everything fresh and with just a bit of a kick to it. Again, wow.   My entree was good, though I'll definitely order something new next time. The crab enchiladas come with a unique style of preparing the rice and beans, and a fresh salad as well. I wasn't a huge fan of the crab filling to be honest, but not because of quality or preparation reasons, more so my own personal taste. I'm going for a shrimp dish next time.  The owner was serving customers himself when I was there and he's an extremely friendly and polite Mexican gentleman. He's created a gem in this part of midtown Phoenix which isn't particularly known for its restaurants.",

We have tried several dishes and none have disappointed so far.  My husband usually has the \"mojarra frita\" it is absolutely delicious.  Their \"seven seas\" soups is excellent.  Wonderful staff, very friendly and they continuously check on us without being annoying.  Even though some feel it's not located in a nice area, we have always felt safe.

The atmosphere brings you back to a vacation in Mexico. The menu is mostly fish with lots of choices to choose from. Everything smells great and is very favorable with reasonable pricing. My brother and I shared the Molcajete Caliente which was so tasty and not spicy, I don't do spicy. They give you their homemade tortilla chips with a red and green salsa the green is the mild but to me that was spicy! My mom had the shrimp with caramelized onions and peppers basically a shrimp fajita, which she thoroughly enjoyed, Everything is fresh and handmade even the corn and flour tortillas. We were given a complimentary dessert by checking in on Yelp and we shared the Chocolate layer cake which was rich and decadent. The only disappointment was the Margaritas, we have had better. Great service and on Fridays they have Mariachis. We will certainly return again.",

We wouldn't deter people from going here but I would suggest San Carlos instead if asked.",

    "text": "OK, mi madre is not prone to going out to eat unless you say the word, \"seafood\" to her. However, my aunt and I read some reviews and used our best cajoling to get her out of her mu mu and into the car to visit this little restaurant just down the way from Ranch Market.   When we walked in, I was excited by the colors and festive feel that they have. We were greeted by the owner who is very attentive, and seated straight away. Having read the Yelp! reviews, I knew I was going to aim for the camarones culichi, and gazed at their vast options anyhow. I consider myself pretty seafood savvy! They have such an array of fish dishes that I long to try! Especially their fish soup... it looked amazing. However, I stuck to my trusted reviews and ordered the camarones culichi, my mother ordered the garlic shrimp, and my aunt ordered the fried fish filet.   I know they said not to fill up on the chips and salsa-- but that green salsa made me so happy, I think I will order a pint to take home next time I go. Trust me.   First, they brought by little ceviche tostadas to try-- I was so excited that the fish tasted so fresh and delightful. Also, free ceviche? I have no idea if they do this all the time, but what a deal! It had a chipotle and citrus flavor immersed in it and was light, but very satisfying.   The culichi sauce is full of tomatillo, cilantro, garlic, and lime-- however, their combination is so magical, I cannot express it without salivating. The shrimp are cooked in the sauce and brought out separate from the salad, beans, and rice, and they have the same amazing taste. I will seriously write a poem for how that sauce tastes-- and they give you plenty of fresh tortillas that I wrapped the beans and rice with and dipped in that sauce to ensure I got every last drop. You could taste the freshness of the fish even in the fried fish, which was seasoned and fried to perfection. The \"exquisite salad\" that they offer with every meal really is exquisite, while simple and melds to the meals well since there isn't a strong dressing on it.   The point is, we left so amazingly joyful and thanked the owner about ten times. I don't know how I am expected to go to another restaurant for some time...",

That room should of only been for that party, not stick us four in with them. Now for the food, the shrimp and the fish were old not fresh at all. The salsa was like water with added spices and the rice was bland. The seven seas soup was mostly tilapia fish and one half of crab leg and two shrimp for $16. We liked the chairs and tables because they were colorful fish and ocean like. The waitress was nice but was too busy with the party table. Drove 40 minutes with our children back and forth to eat fresh seafood and were disappointed. I checked in and you are supposed to have a choice of cake, but the waitress told me that the only choice I had was chocolate or coconut, but I really wanted flan.",

It's casual and interesting at the same time.  The chips are good but the salsa, while being high quality, wasn't my favorite.  The enchiladas, on the other hand, were perfect.  The sauce tasted completely homemade and delicious.  I had the red and green sauces and they couldn't have been better.  My daughter wanted her burrito done a particular way and they nailed it without any complaint.  This is just a high quality Mexican restaurant with nice people as servers and an interesting atmosphere.  Furthermore, the coke was perfect.  You know how some coke tastes more like Cherry Coke or there isn't enough fizz or there is too much fizz.  Best coke I have ever had was here.  This place is a winner!",

OK, it's in a sketchy neighborhood, which for me translates into \"It's not some corporate craphole, reaking of generica\".  Fortunately I saved the receipt just for this review.  The first order was for the drunken shrimp, Camarones Ahogados, which is basically raw shrimp soaked in lime juice.  The idea was off-putting, but the execution is Awesome!  Delicious.  We next ordered the Camarones Culichi (shrimp in some sort of spicy cream sauce, I think), Filete de Pescado al Mojo (which looked good, but junior couldn't finish it.  There was too much for his stomach, already pre-filled with chips and some sort of green sauce, also awesome).  The last 2 orders were a Chile Relleno and Tacos de Pescado.  Anycase, the food was great and I'll be back.",

    "text": "Here in Phoenix I think that we are pretty lucky to have such diversity in each neighborhood. Particularly South Phoenix where you can find great Soul Food at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, Pizza at Amano, and of course various different types and regions of Mexican food. When I say Mexican food I'm really referring to the sort of hole in the wall, real deal family owned operations that are all over the south side of Phoenix. So many of them dot each street corner and call like the Sirens of the night. Marisco's Playa Hermosa is exactly what I mean by this.  \"We bring the sea to the desert\" is their slogan and it's so True. Stepping inside you'll feel like you were just transported to Mazatlan, Mexico, the only things missing here is the ocean. The place is just splashed with bright colors with hand carved tables and birds with a welcoming and friendly staff. With so much to take in it's hard to focus on any one thing, though with so many bird carvings hanging from the ceiling I almost felt like I was in the Tiki Room at Disneyland, less the chatter of the birds of course.   Chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant can be a very good benchmark to judge the rest of your meal, Marisco's would have to be at the top of these tests. Their chips are slightly thick, warm and a little on the oily side, this way the salt can adhere well to them. Accompanying are 2 different salsa, red and green. The red has a certain sweet and hot bitterness that is tasty and even better when washed down with a cold beer. The green is made of creamy avocado and with a warm chip is absolutely delicious. Neither were very hot but that's the thing with real deal Mexican food, its not always hot and spicy. So you'll have no reason to expect the \"burning ring of fire\" the next day!   With so many different and tasty sounding items to choose from, deciding was pretty tough as I really enjoy some good seafood. So imagine this, 8 large perfectly cooked shrimp, swimming in a creamy tomatillo and cilantro sauce, then topped with a sprinkling of cheese. If this sounds like something you would enjoy then go ahead and order the Camarones Culichi ($13.99). You will also get a basket of hot fresh corn or flour tortillas for dunking as well as rice, beans and a fresh lettuce salad dressed with lime juice. The beans have a nice texture with good flavor but the rice is nice! Well steamed and seasoned, the rice has a bright white color which might look bland, but after one bite you'll be wrapping it up in a hot tortilla and dunking it into the beans.   The Mojarra Frita ($15), a fried whole fried fish, sounds and looks good, but decided to be more like a daddy's little girl and order something less involved. Crab Enchilada's ($13) are not only the house specialty but are good to the last bite. 3 corn tortillas over stuffed with sweet crab meat, rolled together with cheese and covered in a slightly spicy red sauce. Again with the rice, beans and salad this is a pretty large plate and for the money, a great value. The enchiladas were actually featured in Gourmet Magazine at one time, who knew?  On the back of the menu you'll find a section called Camida Mexicana which are plates of regular Mexican fare such as burritos, taco's and fajitas. Not trying the Carne Asada Taco's ($6.99) would be a real shame since the meat is so tender and the flavor so beefy. A plate full of 3 tacos, double tortilla, chopped beef and onions, with rice and beans is both satisfying and ample. Douse the tacos with some of the guacamole salsa and you'll have a party on your plate! The Quesadilla ($7.99) is just cheese and a tortilla, while good it was quite ordinary. However the smell from the Fajitas De Pollo ($10.99) was amazing! I'll have those to myself next time!  For dessert you can stick with maybe a Mexican Coke ($2) made with real sugar or a large glass of over ice Horchata ($2.50). Though for something more, the Flan ($4) was different than what you normally get. More cake like and dense than silky smooth, it was decent enough and a nice finish to so many savory dishes. Otherwise there aren't any other desserts offers, like you'll have room after such good sized portions anyway.   Marisco's Playa Hermosa is a real gem and has the menu, friendliness and comfortable vibe to back it up. While the neighborhood feels a bit on the seedy side, as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained?",

The chips and salsa were very good, although I didn't care for a somewhat smoky flavor of the salsa roja.  The verde was much better!  I went with the camarones salad to start.  Really tasty, LOADS of shrimp (maybe they had to get rid of them), but for me a bit too many onions.  However, the mixture, topped with cilantro was very tasty. In addition to the chips, a big basket of crackers accompanied the dish.  The entree I selected was the camarones culichi.  It was very tasty, with the sauce light, but delicious.  The flour tortillas were fresh and warm.  The meal was accompanied but a Negra Modelo (in the bottle, but they had it on tap as well.)  All in all, it was a great experience.  I don't think I will be able to make it back on this trip (and don't really know if I will ever - it's a long way from Alaska) but highly recommend stopping by.

I have eaten a variety of their plates and everything has been amazing. Their cocktail shrimp is great. Shrimp and Pescado ceviche is clutch! I enjoyed every bite. Camarones a la crema de broccoli is amazing. I thought it sounded weird at first, but once I digged in I wanted more after each bite. I really want to try every plate!  My 5 year old nephew is a VERY picky eater. I don't think he's ever tried seafood and liked it, but I somehow got him (okay forced him) to have camarones a la plancha once. Whabam! He LOVED the camarones a la plancha. He refuses to eat any other shrimp if it isn't like how playa hermosa prepares them.  Went during happy hour and got SUPER CHEAP Negra Modelo. They have soccer games playing, so enjoy a nice michelada or beer watching your favorite team.   The service is great too. The owners are super nice. They really care about their customers.   The place is in shady looking area, but don't let that frighten you. The place is a diamond in the rough.",

I went here with the International Supper Club and was surprised at what a nice place this was. The ladies who work here were wonderful and accommodating to our ever growing party (uhh 2 more chairs please?) and managed to get most (not all) of the food out at around the same time for over 20 people... pretty good stuff. I went out on a limb, not being a fish person, and ordered the fish fillet divorciados and my risk came with great reward... this was delicious! It was a lightly fried fish fillet (that was HUGE) covered in half red sauce and half green. The red sauce was fairly good, but the green sauce was amazing... spicy, yet fresh tasting. The fish was so flaky and perfectly cooked.... it wasn't fishy at all. The plate was so huge, I shared with two other people and was still stuffed. As good as my dish was, the other couple dishes I tried weren't as delicious. I tried the fish tacos, which were very weird...like mini quesadillas with little bits of fish inside and they tasted very fishy....not my cup of tea. The al pastor tacos were alright, but nothing special. I think the key to this restaurant is to get the seafood (duhhhh). We also got to try several of their cakes which were all alright, but none were amazing. The coconut cake was my favorite. Anyway, I would definitely come here again!",

    "text": "I have finally made it down to Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  The restaurant is a tiny building on the SE corner of 16th St and Garfield.  Just south of a ran down liquor store.  The parking lot is very small so be prepared to park on the street.  The inside is colorful but smelled very strongly of bleach.    The waitress took our drink order but never came back.  Another girl came out to take our food order and asked if we wanted drinks.  We let her know that the other girl already took them and then she came back to ask us again what we wanted.  Shotty service from the jump and a knockout of bleach to the nose wasn't a very good start for me.  We ordered a medium shrimp cocktail, shrimp ceviche, and camarones culichi to share.  Our drinks made it out with some chips and green and red salsa.  Both salsas were plain and non noteworthy.  The other food came out next.  The culichi had a zesty green sauce that was a blend of tomatillos, cilantro, and spices.  Very tasty and went pretty well with the shrimp and even better poured on the rice and beans.  The ceviche was also tasty.  Lots of tiny pieces of shrimp with a nice lime flavor and pico de gallo mixed together.  The shrimp cocktail was boring uninspired and didn't belong on the same table as the other two dishes.  The green culichi sauce was unique and creative and the ceviche was on point.  The shrimp cocktail and rest of the experience fell flat.  The service wasn't great (forgot drinks, no refill offered), the price was ok (13.99 for 8 shrimp in a tomatillo sauce is about right), and the ambiance was weakened withe the smell (no cleaning solvent should overpower the smell of your cuisine).",

The flavor was still there and I love spicy, but next time I'll try the tomatillo. Bit too painful for me. ( I ordered a horchata to try and help numb my swollen tongue) I really love the side of beans,salad and rice. Beans are perfectly seasoned, salad is tangy and refreshing, and the rice has texture. Not the pink puffy rice with minimal flavor that is served at so many mexican restaurants. They also have strong margaritas and huge mugs of draft beer.  Just seeing the pictures makes me want to go there now!",

The shrimp was seasoned to perfection. I will definitely be back with a group so we can spread the word on this hidden gem. I also will add that they do have a patio that is dog friendly (I'm dog obsessed). Go here. You will not be dissapointed. This place is authentic. Buenos dias.",

Not only did they give us salsa and chips (both delicious) to start our meal, but also a small serving of cerviche which was fantastic. And the meals were SO BIG. We were just two people, and after we both ordered a meal and a margharita, the waiter asked us, \"is that all?\" and we were worried we hadn't ordered enough but it turned out we ordered too much. And oh my gosh it was so good.  The server recommended shrimp in green sauce, and we also go the octopus. Amazing! As a side note, the beer serving was also huge. The atmosphere was perfect, there was copious parking, the restaurant was maybe a 7 minute drive from our car rental. Everything was for the win!  They do close early (at least when we were there) so keep that in mind. But oh my gosh, thank you for your incredible Mexican food!",

    "text": "Aaah the unassuming, small restaurant in a questionable part of town. I should know these happen to be some of the BEST places for a meal.   We decided on this place after my son did a little research on Mariscos Restaurants in the area. It was in celebration of my hubs \"26th\" birthday and his craving for Mariscos.   Upon pulling up to the restaurant we gave each other questionable look due  to the size of the restaurant and neighborhood, but it quickly discipitated upon entrance. Beautifuuul, colorful decor. Very clean and plenty of seating with a full bar. We chose seats and our waitress came over for our drink order. In addition to the traditional chips and salsa we were also brought ceviche tostadas.. ON THE HOUSE. I personally liked both salsas and the chips were thin and crispy and fresh. Hubs wasn't feeling either the red or green salsa.  I ordered the fish tacos - FABULOUS. I was expecting fried fish and cream sauce but received fresh grilled fish with a sprinkling of cheese. I was a liitle doubtful but with my first bit I was in love. Sooooo good and so flavorful without the guilt that comes with eating fried food. The rice is not a tomato based rice, flavorful nonetheless, white with veggies. Very good. The beans were also very good, reminded me of grandmas.  We all tasted each others food and there was not one thing I didn't love. My daughter got the Shrimp Ranchera.. fresh, delicious shrimp and veggies in a light, lemony sauce. My son got the Molcajete Caliente.. GREAT dish to share. The meat, and the fish were the BEST. The sauce was nice and smokey and had just a full great flavor to it. Hubs got a seafood cocktail depsite my coaxing into getting a pescado frito. I wanted a taste :/ His cocktail was very good despite them using canned clams rather than fresh.   This has quickly become my new favorite Mariscos spot in AZ. Can't wait to visit again and try some of the other dishes!",

The set up was very nice with indoor and outside seating.  Service was slow.  It took a while for everything (order, drinks, appetizers, check) despite there being few diners. Margarita was weak.  Fajitas didn't sizzle.  My family thought that the food lacked flavor (added lots of extra hot sauce ) but I thought it was OK (only added a little hot sauce).

She was very patient and helpful, answering all the questions we had. I don't even remember the names of the dishes we had... I think one was the Veracruz style fish. Delicious!!!! We didn't order appetizers but she brought out two small complimentary ones that whet our appetites for more. The mariachi band was excellent and very entertaining. The young lady had a wonderful voice and could hold a note forever! Finished off by forcing (only because I was already stuffed and have zero willpower) a piece of awesome carrot cake.

Unfortunately, the food was only okay. It seemed that much of the menu is served \"Fajitas Style\" (my words, not theirs) and the Shrimp, peppers and onions were nothing special, plus the portions I thought were small (eight medium sized shrimp). No \"knock you over\" flavors in this dish and the best thing about the meal was the wonderfully done rice.  Won't repeat as my disappointment will not go away any time soon.",

I would order it diabla, as it is spicy but not too spicy.  Also the drinks are super cheap! A 24oz beer was only $6. Wow. You need to check this place out!",

Once you get pasted the secretive tinted windows, however, it's an entirely different world. Vibrant colors hit your eyes and vivacious music pleases your eardrums. It really makes you feel like you're near a playa hermosa.   To start off, we were given a complimentary hard tortilla with ceviche on it. You can taste how fresh and delectable the combination of ingredients is. I've had plenty of ceviche in Latin American countries and theirs is on par.   The selection here is ridiculous, but in a good way. I ended up going simple and ordering some shrimp tacos. You get 3 tacos with rice, beans, and salad. The tacos don't include any filler ingredients like Americans prefer. Just straight up shrimp smothered in oozing melted cheese. Can't get much more legit than that. The rice, beans, and salad were all pretty typical and were a good compliment to the meal.   Thank you Marisocs Playa Hermosa for fulfilling my friend's craving for amazing legit Mexican food after being stuck in the Romney infested part of Colorado for a year. The service is warm and friendly, decor is unexpected but awesome, and the food is as close as you can get without crossing the border.",

I completely simpled out  when ordering and simply got the Mar Y Tierra  (surf & turf - - a stir-fry-up of strip steak and gobsmackingly richly embroidered shrimp).   The little tortilla that came as an appertizer-thingy with the meal was like tiny cubes of chunk tuna in a vinegar-like sauce.

They have around 5 draft beers of standard mexican brews (Tecate, Dos, Corona, etc.).  To start the meal I ordered a $4.00 24 oz draft and the waitress brought out complementary (homemade) chips with two types of tasty salsa. A gratis talapia ceviche tostata (also pictured) followed, which was impressive.  I had an excellent shredded beef taco and carne asada enchaladas with red sauce (photo posted). The carne had a great grilled flavor that came through the bold taste of the red sauce. The salad was fresh and the rice contained lima beans, carrots, peas and corn - not your uninspired rice you typically get.   My waitress was helpful and attentive, the remaining staff was busy cleaning and organizing - a sign of a well run business. The deserts looked great (coconut cake, a chocolate cake and a stawberry merange pie looking thing) but was too full to partake.   It's close to the airport so I hit this after my business trip. Same experience! I'll return here when in Phonix again.",

It was so rich and flavorful with just a hint of heat. The sides were delicious, but I only had room to sample them. Thanks to Yelp, I got a free piece of flan which was so good that I ordered another to go for my flan-loving child.  I'm only in Phoenix for 5 more days, but I think I will be back...",

We were seated in the back of the restaurant, all alone, like kids on a time out. And while our waitress was very lovely, I think she forgot about us a lot because service was very slow. The restaurant was slightly busy, but not crazy, so we expected a little more attention. We had to keep leaving our table to ask for water, or drinks, or the check- it was annoying.   Now the good news: the food is excellent. Super yummy and very generous portions. Had the ceviche, fish tacos, and chicken enchiladas- all excellent.   So overall, it was a great meal- but service needs work. Will definitely be back to try again. :)",

I haven't been here before they remodeled the interior to fit more seating but it definitely looks really nice now and very colorful inside.  We decided on getting the Shrimp Cocktail and the Molcajete for two people. The Shrimp Cocktail was very tasty and everything we had hoped for. As for the Molcajete we were a bit disappointed that there was quite a bit of chicken and steak since we had hoped for more seafood. The sauce used was a \"Diabla\" sauce which was really good and surprisingly not as spicy as I had anticipated. I'm glad that we tried their house specialty but would probably pass on it next time that we come here.  Service was friendly and prompt. Overall this is a great place if you're looking for Mexican style seafood!",

You will hit the curb, we saw the person after us hit the curb also and then the guy from our insurance that came to change our tire also said he hit it too.   The place is very small feels very crowded especially with the band. WAY too loud, could barely hear the waitress or my boyfriend so didn't even bother talking much.   Food was good(had the shrimp ceviche )even though mine came out wrong at first, and I'm sure she forgot about one of my orders cause I had to ask about it.   Definitely not a place for babies/kids. They don't have changing tables!! Had to go to my car and change my baby in the hot car!! Big big negative!!  Waitress was nice, but they have them all over the place so I had to ask another worker twice to get our waitress cause she never passes by us to even be able to wave her down.  I would recommend it for couples/grownups only",

For an appetizer, we ordered the choriqueso which was piping hot cheese with chorizo mixed in. It was excellent! The fried shrimp came with rice and beans and was fried and seasoned very well. The refried beans were tasty. My sister let me try her carne asada taco and the meat was well done. My sister's fiance ordered bacon wrapped shrimp with cheese and it was the best thing I tried. Must get! My cousin's fried fish in garlic sauce was also good. My dad ordered caldo de camaron (shrimp soup) and he liked it a lot. Alcohol menu was decent and they make virgin margaritas, too.",

But then I'm not sure how often the waitress will notice you are there... Also I'm not sure if they have properly exits in case of a fire...having so many costumers inside can be a  problem without the emergency exits... I don't know I have kids so I'm always trying to figure out how to protect them. The restaurant offers a free small ceviche tostada as appetizer per person, make sure to ask to get it, a few times our waitress has forgot to bring it to our table.",

We had trouble with a rental car that we did not take from the lot and then accidentally leaving something in it and we were on the phone for quite some time before we can place our order. The server was very understanding and did not bother us too much. He did bring chips and salsa and water right away which were consumed while on the phone trying to straighten out our missing item.  After taking our order he brought out a free ceviche tostada. It had great fresh, seafood flavor and the tostada was very crispy.  Bass & shrimp \"divorciados\" - that means that half of the dish is covered in a spicy red/orange colored sauce and the other half is covered in a very tasty green chili sauce. A lot of Mexican places also call this Christmas because of the red and green. It was too much food along with the really creamy refried beans and a slightly different version of Spanish rice in that it had a little bit of green beans, carrots and corn in it and the rice was white, not yellow. It was moist and went well as a base for the two sauces.   Calamares & shrimp al ajo - this was a large casserole full of sauteed calamari rings and shrimp swimming, literally, in white wine, olive oil and garlic. It was just too much sauce, although fresh and flavorful.  Corn tortillas however were too processed. They need more rustic looking and more tender corn tortillas. These look, felt and tasted like a major retail brand. Not good.",

Chips were thick corn and the salsa was water but the guacamole sauce was pretty good. The 'drowning shrimp' was a nice start and I thought the rest of the meal would follow suit.  I thought I was playing it safe with garlic shrimp, but I was surprised that for $15 you get six medium (seriously the 25-40 size) shrimp. The 7 seas soup was watery with little to it...the main reason we drove 30 minutes to the ghetto...think Notorious BIG \"Juicy\" playing in the background as you roll up.  Homeless drunk lady harassing patrons as they waited for tables and the guy I told about it seemed to care less.  The mariachi band was a nice authentic touch and was fun, but a bit intense for such a small place.    Don't get me wrong. It's a good mariscos restaurant and if you are in the area it's probably the best mexican seafood option for more than a few blocks.  My apologies for some reason my phone only saved the pic of the 'drowning shrimp' (raw shrimp over cucumber and tomato drizzled with lemon juice,salt,pepper and topped with avocado and onion ---like whole shrimp ceviche.)",

They can also accommodate large parties. I had my bday dinner here and had about 20 people attend. On Sundays, they have mariachi starting at 4pm, so make sure to check it out during that time, but they do get busy.",

Just because a neighborhood is not all white does not mean it's bad. This great place is on a main road across from a church and near a senior apartment complex and a hospital. Seriously folks. Let's not be so judgy.    Also, it is not crappy from the outside. In fact it is brightly painted, inviting, and has a patio with lights strung over it. Inside is decorated just as beautifully, with colorful paintings, lush greenery, and cozy tables. We happened to stop by on a Friday night and were entertained by a mariachi band. It did mean that it was a little loud at times, but everyone in the restaurant seemed to be having a great time. It was family oriented--several groups with kids--as well as couples on date nights.   The food was excellent. Shrimp ceviche -- incredible. The waitress recommended molcajete caliente (cheesy hotpot with fish, shrimp, chicken, carne asada, and octopus). It came with beans, rice, tortillas, and a little salad. Yum yum. Chips were a little greasier than we would like but were free and came with two good salsas.

So i finally did not listen to my gut feeling and I am glad i didn't. We got their special stone bowl with mocalate...I am 100% i spelled that wrong, there was different meat in it and it was delicious.... I am actually drooling thinking of this dish again.   Yes I will be back and I might just order that again, because it was so good. (i am sure there other items are good too).  I would pass on desserts though.",

Service was prompt, friendly and attentive. We ordered oysters preparado, ceviche, seafood cocktail and al pastor. All were divine! Can't wait to go back!",
