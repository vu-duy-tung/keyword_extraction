There seem to be no starters so I am just gonna get right to the meal. I ordered from the kids menu since I did not want something big. My final decision was a classic burger. The burger was very well cooked and had some sort of cheese that was the best I have ever had and believe me, I know cheese, it's all I eat. My dad's got a BLT and a taco. The BLT was huge but good and my dad could not eat it all. He ate most of it, trust me, after that if he does not go to the gym he is Gonna have be fat. My grandma got the salad but she was very clear on how she wanted it so much so it technically was not a salad anymore.   I The service and the building  itself was nice. Our waiters name I think was Dylan so I give kudos to him and I like the interesting  conversations me and my family got engaged in with him. They have some amaze artwork in here. The lights over the table are equipped so you can pull them down if per say you could not read the menu.   Village tavern is a amazing place and I hope next Time I visit Phoenix I will come by here. I hope we get Dylan to wait on  us again",

    "text": "So last night, Wednesday, my typical routine involves dragging my a$$ to a gym class. My friend calls me as I'm driving home from work and suggests the opposite of a workout -- Happy Hour. The week I've been having... there was just one answer-- YESSSSSSS!!!!   I suggested Village Tavern, having seen good reviews and remember eating there a year ago, wanting to revisit.  The experience last year wasn't really memorable -- it was the type of situation where I was hungry and the place is a mile from my house, so it more just fit the bill.  Last night however was a different story.  We go to the bar section, it is packed but still has a table or two available inside. We sit down, and are greeted by the waitress. We start with the happy hour $5 Grey Goose cocktails -- they are Strong. Just what the doctor ordered. We split the prime rib sliders, and brie plate. Each are around $8. Both are delish!!!! The prime rib sliders are so good, come with au jus and have a ton of melted cheese on them. The brie platter is very good as well. Dried cranberries, apricots, and almonds are plenty on the plate, as well as great italian bread and our own little brie wheel. For girls skipping gym class, this is what its all about -- happy indulgences.  We were debating a third cocktail before happy hour ended, when the waitress informed us that Wednesdays are half off all wine glasses -- ALL NIGHT!!! WOOHOO!!!  So we switched to a glass of wine each and nibbled on some toast triangles and the worries from earlier in the week just turned into good laughs with a good friend.  We also agreed next Wednesday, we WOULD go to gym class -- but come back to Village Tavern afterwards for a little wine indulgence.  ;)  The scene should be mentioned -- almost exclusively Gainey Ranch retirees. Looks like they get all the good seats by 5pm.  Its a scene where you can pay attention to your friends and your food because there just isnt much eye candy to distract you....unless you're over 50. The inside decor is upscale tavern-y, very warm and inviting.",

There were so many different options including meat, seafood and different comfort food. We opted for the filets and they were nicely chared crisped on the outside and a warm pink inside. Perfect done for Medium Rare. We will be back",

The bar seating was just the right setting to revel on a Sunday night and since the Kitchen closed at 10pm (but the bar is open til 12am) we took our time w the Menu... We enjoyed the Quinoa & Kale Salad which sounds a little too healthy by the description but was made less so by the fried crunchy onions piled on top which were delicious!  Then had a side of sauteed spinach & the Chicken Tacos to split... Portions were massive and just what we needed after a long day of hiking Camelback mountain! Great wine selection too! The Service was top notch and almost too friendly (in a pleasant way!) but this is what happens when the server mentions he's a bow hunter and gets my Man all excited to talk about things I find boring!  Oh well, at least I got an extra glass of Pinot Grigio out of the deal!",

    "text": "Make a reservation for lunch with my coworkers. Our server, John, immediately came to take our drink orders and see if we had questions. To my delight, I saw that they had an additional gluten-free menu (you must ask for it). I'm used to have to just pick and choose through restaurants menus for what I believe would be gluten-free so it's nice that they had this option. Their kitchen is not gluten-free from my understanding, however I am not Celiac so it did not alter my decision. I ordered the Gluten-Free Margarita pizza and mango tea. Both delicious! Gluten-free breads tend to have a bit of an issue with texture, but this one was pretty spot on. Thin crust and about 9\" around, it was definitely large enough to share if you ordered an appetizer as well. My coworkers ordered dishes ranging from Spinach Salad, Grilled Salmon, Prime Rib, and Grouper. All had nothing but amazing things to say about their orders. Desert time and we went all out - again. Raspberry Sorbet, Double Decker Cheesecake, Warm Apple Pie, and Butter Cake. HOLY MOLY. I could only eat the sorbet and some bites of the cheesecake, but the reviews from the crowd were all outstanding on every item. But, all in all, the best part about the entire experience was John. He was very attentive to us throughout the entire meal - even balancing another very large group, plus his other tables. He was great with recommendations and answering any questions we had. Others in my group have been going to Village Tavern for years and said that he is the best server they've had there. He genuinely brought this rating to a 5 star. As a group, we all decided that the next time we go back, we will request to be sat in his section. Thanks, John!",

I had the chicken broccoli pasta which I would have enjoyed more if it hadn't been covered in some kind of spice (paprika maybe?  It was red.)  I wish places didn't think alfredo pasta needs color.  It doesn't.  When people order alfredo, we understand it's going to be white.  You don't need to put spices or herbs on top.    Atmosphere here is great.  Service was slightly slow.  It took a long time to get our drinks, but our waiter was certainly friendly.  A couple coworkers had salads and said they were delicious.  They are also known for their seafood.  My boss had a salad with salmon on it and said it was the best salmon she'd ever tasted.",

I befriended Paul, the General Manager there and was surprised and  impressed that he suggested that I go and try other restaurants out.

I would have liked to have my shrimp marinate in the garlic butter sauce for flavor because I don't think the cook even used anything to flavor them , my husband ordered his usual burger and fries , The fries were completely old and hard as well as the flavor and temp of burger tasted like it had been sitting back there for a long time. Server never brought salad dressing and water that were requested $50 later we had to stop off at hr grocery store to go grab some food to fill us up after such a disappointing meal :( hopefully management will step up and make some changes because I use to love this place but for awhile I won't be back",

We corrected him and it continued downhill when I asked for a Newcastle and after 15 minutes asked where it was and he said they were out. He recommended something else which I tried and it was a poor suggestion. The bar manager stopped by and said yes we have Newcastle and brought me one. The problem took so long to solve the table ordered their second round and I hadn't received my first.  I ordered the sea bass skip it. It came out as a portion controlled slice. Never seen it served that way before. Couple very poor service and portion control food led to a poor experience.",

    "text": "FOOD: The best prime rib I've ever had. I always enjoy the wine, too. Appetizers are pretty good, especially calamari. Can't say much more about the food because I only get the prime rib whenever I go. \"Stick to what you know,\" the saying goes. Try it!  PRICE: For the prime rib meal, an appetizer, and a drink it'll be over $30 for sure.   ATMOSPHERE: For a dirty, uncultured college student like me, this place is more upscale than the vast majority of places I eat. It's a nice restaurant with nice seating. Don't go in with flip flops, Scottsdale brosefs.   SERVICE: For the most part, good servers and very helpful.   SKINNY: I always go here with family and I always get the prime rib and I'm always happy as can be and I'm stopping this run-on sentence.",

    "text": "Village Tavern isn't terrible, but it was oh-so-forgetable!   The first time I went here I got the French Onion soup and although it was more cheese than I'd normally like, it was pretty good. The main dish I got, the Shrimp Risotto, was far from impressive. I've had better in a frozen microwave meal.   The second time I went, which was last weekend, I got the Marinated Flank Steak with a side of potatoes Au gratin. The steak was cut very thick for flank steak and was pretty chewy. The potatoes in the Au gratin weren't cooked all the way through and were just lacking any flavor. The vegetables on the side aren't worth mentioning.   The service both times I went was fine. Nothing too exciting, nothing to entice me to come back. As for the restaurant itself,  it's a nice looking place, but the food just doesn't live up to it. Maybe myself and those I've gone with have been ordering the wrong menu items, but I continue to not be wowed.",

I had a friend that swore by this place, because she use to live by it, and we were actually going to go to Houston's but went the wrong way on Scottsdale ,so we ended up here.   It was the middle of the afternoon and after walking in I felt like i had entered a geriatrics ward, we were the only two people in the place besides the staff that was under 40.  My friend got the wraps which were so bad she could not even eat them, so our server removed them from our bill, I got the chicken club sandwich with pasta salad and iced tea.   Our service for the most part was pretty bad, we had like 5 different people come to our table when we were there, not a 100 percent on who our server actually was, but we would ask one person for a refill and they would say sure then someone else would come back with no drink refill.  Our table was a bit dirty when we sat down. in general this placed sucked, service was poor, the food was garbage, and in general even though this place is huge it truly is like a hole in the wall shit bar restaurant.",

Given that it's so generic, I'll spare you the review of the ambiance and the service since it's typical and average as well.   My mother raved about the potato chips which were okay... they were basically deep fried potato slices with salt... some were crispy and some were soggy. It looked too greasy for me at that moment in time, so I only had a few. I'm wondering if the excessive grease and apparent overcooking contributed to the gut rot my girlfriend experienced.  We all ordered salads after discussing burgers and other rich foods. I opted for the Chicken Caesar. It was pretty mediocre and I didn't finish it. They brought us bread after we asked and then reminded a few times and it was just as average as everything else about this place.   Nothing sticks out here as being special in any way. The place seems to be aiming for semi-upscale, but is failing or just barely putting in the minimum required effort.",

For dinner we had the BBQ baby back ribs which came w fries and coleslaw but we subbed asparagus for the fries.  It was a massive portion but really tender, fall off the bone meat!  And lastly...the star of the show...their newly featured grouper Hemingway which was pan seared, perfectly cooked grouper served on a bed of spinach in a white wine, lemon butter sauce and topped w tomatoes, capers, and Parmesan cheese.  I cannot say enough how absolutely delicious this was...if you're debating what to order, DEFINITELY give this a shot.  Service was also good, very prompt.

    "text": "A group of us went here for dinner this past evening.  We had a longer than expected wait before being seated.  Appeared the problem might be a lack of servers rather than space in the restaurant.  A wide variety of items were ordered.  Service, as in speed to get drinks was abysmal.  This followed suit throughout the meal with refills being similarly slow and requiring multiple reminders to the server.    Overall, the food received mixed reviews by the respective diners.  One person ordered a salad with chicken and ended up without the chicken.  Took a long time to get that sorted, but not as long as it took to get ketchup for fries.   Nice enough server so perhaps the issue is more with management not staffing the restaurant properly, but with the food not being a grand slam and the mistake in order and painfully slow service I rate them two stars and wonder how they have secured as high a rating as they have.",

In my book fried (or any) wontons by definition have filling so this was a big disappointment. But the other dishes net expectations (salmon, grouper, filet, shrimp) so I give it 4 stars.",

We tried the Very Best Carrot cake and the Warm Butter cake for dessert. Both are LEGENDARY!   They were ridiculously delicious.

    "text": "The food is excellent but the service from waiters and management is lacking.   Last night, my father and I dinned at th Scottsdale location. While dinning we noticed that on the table was a promotion for signing up with the Village Taverns email list. On the sign it says sign up and receive 25% off. Before dinner was over I quickly signed up to join and showed the wait staff that I joined. The server told me sorry that 25% off would be for your next visit and he would be glad to have the manager come speak to me regarding the restrictions. The manger on duty last night came over and asked if I had any question. I stated that according to the promotional flyer on the table it says \"Connect with Us! Get 25% off. Just for joining!\" No where on the flyer is a restriction regarding when you can take advantage of this 25% off. He argued that if he was to give the 25% off tonight, that I would still be receiving the 25% off coupon that could be used at a later date and how was that fair. A patron of an establishment should not have to argue about restrictions that are not published anywhere not even on the website. In addition, a patron should not be belittled and be give a guilt trip from manager on duty when questioning the lack of publish restrictions of a promotional off.   Finally the manager agreed to honor the 25% off but only applied it to one item instead of the whole bill like the promotion leads one to believe. It's almost like they are using a bait and switch to increase their email following.",

In ordering a dish and specifically mentioning no spice and for sure not the spicy sauce.  Well it came with the sauce and when I mentioned to the server, they took it back, wiped off, but still there and unable to eat.  One of the others at the table ordered a wedge salad which never was served. This was not a particularly busy time, so hard to excuse.  The service is very dependent on the server, some are outstanding and some not so much.  We will try again and hope to have a better experience.",

The meat was a perfect medium rare as ordered and the sides were simple and tasty. The atmosphere was dark wood and reminded me of Houston's. The service was terrific.

I got the Grilled Meatloaf that came with mashed potatoes and string beans and I got the Spinach salad too. I really enjoyed my meal; in truth I felt full after the salad but I powered through and ate 1/2 my meal. The meatloaf was very good; 2 thick charred slices with the dish; sort of a smokey flavor to it. The salad was really good too. My husband got a chicken sandwich but he said the chicken was dry and it was way to difficult to eat as a sandwich so he used a fork and knife to eat it instead... he had a taste of my meatloaf and agreed it was good - better then his; I shared :) Our bill was around $50; that included 2 entrees, one side dish (mac & cheese) that was good, my salad and 1 glass of wine and 1 beer. Not inexpensive but also not too bad considered we each took 1/2 the entrees home and had them for lunch the next day.",

The service varies from good to excellent, but where they really shine is in their willingness to accommodate requests. They have managed every request we have ever thrown at them, & some of the people we have taken are really difficult (allergies, intolerances, etc.) Another thing I really like about the Village Tavern is the menu variety. I can get a burger & fries, or a Mexican salad (excellent, BTW), or Thai nachos (also excellent, but only order if you have a friend to share), or shrimp scampi. For someone who eats there all the time, variety is important.   The only thing I don't like about the Village Tavern is that in the Winter/Spring it seems to be full of snowbirds & it can be hard to get a table. (& they seem to crowd the lobby area with the intent of making sure that no one can get through.) So I make a reservation or get take out, no big deal, but something to note.",

The restaurant is insanely cozy, with bubbled glass window panes and a giant fireplace at the head of the main dining room.  Their french onion soup and New York Strip steak are my two favorites. Great place to go when you aren't sure what you're in the mood to eat -- there's so many options at Village Tavern. Naomi Garnice gives it four stars.",

    "text": "Love meat and potatoes? This might be the place for you.   I met some girlfriends here for lunch. Turns out, it's really not one of those \"ladies who lunch\" places. It's dark and clubby, reminiscent of old-fashioned men's clubs that you see in movies. There are lots of private booths, mostly filled with men in suits talking business and / or sports. If only this were the 1960's, Don Draper and the other Mad Men guys would be smoking cigarettes and drinking martinis in the corner booth.   The food is primarily meat and potatoes. Yes, they do have other things on the menu, but it's the steak, prime rib, and hamburgers that really shine. When ordering, I attempted to strike a compromise between beef and veggie healthy. So I ordered the tenderloin teriyaki stir fry. The aroma and presentation were good, but the meat was definitely not tenderloin filet. It was chewy and grisly, perhaps the castoffs of the high quality steaks served to others? One of my friends ordered the double bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries; a bold choice among the \"ladies who lunch\" group. But her burger was big and juicy, and she said it tasted great. She loved her sweet potato fries, crisp and a hint of cinnamon.   Village Tavern is all about the meat and potatoes; just don't go there expecting a nice light lunch.",

I made a reservation through open table and arrived with my party of 7 for dinner. I goofed up and only made the res for 2 (totally my fault). Even though it was crowded, they found us a table and said they didn't need it for 90 minutes, asked if that would be ok. That's great!!  Food was great, I had the kale salad and added salmon, husband had sea bass. Both cooked perfectly. Son had shrimp and grits, others had steak, pork chops, a little of everything. I appreciate so much that the staff squeezed us in after my mistake. Great night!",

    "text": "This was our first time at Village Tavern.  We were having a pre-mother's day dinner on Saturday to avoid the usual Sunday crowds. Village Tavern was selected based on Yelp reviews and what appeared to be a very diverse menu.   We started off with a Guiness and a Fonseca Port Wine which was delicious.  A little pricey at $10.50 for about 4 oz of Port.  I enjoyed it though.  I ordered the French onion soup which was a little on the salty side but I love salt so I ate every last drop of it.  I selected a crab cake (appetizer) which came with tartar sauce along with an order of  french fries, The crab cakes were amazing.  Real crab meat almost no breading.  Excellent.   Hubby had the trout which was a really nice portion of filets with a teriyaki type glaze. He selected the sweet potato fries which had a hint of cinnamon and possibly a light sprinkling of sugar.  He really, really enjoyed his meal.  The True test of whether he likes a dish is to ask if he would order it again.  His answer was absolutely!   We topped off the dinner with apple cobbler with a scoop of Hagaan Daz.  We held off on the caramel sauce because we thought it would make it too sweet- and we were right.  The cobbler was really delicious and large enough that two of us couldn't finish it. This review would not be complete without commenting on the service.  Jared was our server and he was very informative and attentive.  Thanks to Jared now I know that seafood is flown in every day to Village Tavern.  That means I will go to Village Tavern for my seafood dishes.  Our waters were filled and he checked on us often.   Thanks Jared. And thanks   to Village Tavern for running such a great kitchen and a smooth operation.",

Some of my favorites - Prime Rib of course (and if you order the sandwich at lunch time, it's a full thick slice of prime rib on bread and about a buck cheaper than the lunch prime rib, and it's the same thing!), the taco salad is delish (and you don't even need the dressing). It's a must if you're looking for someplace great. AND for upcoming Mother's Day, they're having an extremely reasonable brunch, about $20 less than the resorts and I bet the food will be superb!  Oh yeah, one more thing, private parties, they're great at. Hosted a party there and they're very accommodating!   Can go casual or have a nice romantic dinner. Atmosphere is nice!",

It was not crowded and we were seated right away, which was nice however our waiter came over about 5 or 6 minutes later to ask what we wanted to drink and eat.  We place our drink and app order and while we were telling him about our entree, he walked away.  I don't know if another patron got his attention or he was bored with us but just plain walked away.  He came back a few minutes later with our drinks and a cold appetizer.  We placed our entree order and our food was just...bad.  One order was undercooked, the other overcooked.  We tried to get his attention but he didn't come back from about 5 or 6 minutes again and we just figured \"f this\" ate and when he came back he just left the check and left again.  I have to say, I expect more and have always experienced better.  I would hate to think I have to take this place out of our rotation of places.",

The round table they gave us was way too small for us - when our entrees arrived, we had to consolidate plates so we could all eat.  Service was terrible!  The server was very nice and friendly to us, but either she or the kitchen needs a lot of work if they expect to have us come back.  Entrees came very late - one entree didn't come until 15 minutes after all the rest were served. Food was generally good, burgers were warm, not hot.  We did complain to the manager on duty - about the service and the size of the table.  He offered and we accepted free desserts for our inconveniences.  What a mistake that was! It took 20 minutes for them to arrive, and those of us who ordered the mini sundaes had a cup of milk instead of ice cream.  We have all been there before, many times, and don't know what happened this time.  Perhaps Sunday is too busy a day for them to handle .... although there were many empty tables.  We did ask for 5 separate checks up front, and we know that is inconvenient, but should not create these kinds of issues.  We love this restaurant, but they need to work these things out!",

The website shows no Happy Hour food offerings and frankly that's a good thing because there was nothing of interest on the happy hour food menu. We did partake in the $5 cocktails and $4 wine.  We decided not to order from the less than interesting happy hour food menu and ordered the Shanghai crispy calamari from the regular menu. It was a very large plate of thin and crispy calamari rings literally doused in a sweet and spicy Thai chili sauce with crisp and spicy pickled jalapenos, scallions, and peanuts. It could've been a tiny bit hotter but it was delicious.  For dinner my better half got the cowboy chicken sandwich with black beans. He loved the sandwich, the crispy onion rings, the bacon, cheese and barbecue sauce. The black bean side dish was not warm enough but the server quickly returned it with a new plate, fully hot.  My dish was the Idaho trout - highly recommended by the server, who was right once again. It was perfectly cooked, juicy and not dry with just enough of this sweet soy teriyaki glaze to give it flavor but not overpower it. The green beans were tender but still green and the rice pilaf was a good base for both of those items.  Manhattans made with Jack Daniels were five dollars during happy hour and they were delicious with a Luxardo cherry but make sure you tell the server not to shake if you like a clear, see-through Manhattan!  We will return!",

    "text": "My wife and I and another coupled enjoyed lunch at the Village Tavern yesterday.  The service was great and the food was even better. I don't think anyone left a thing on their plate.  I had the shrimp and grits.  I'm a huge fan of this dish (I tend to think of it as a poor man's risotto).  The grits were perfect.  Creamy with just enough 'grittiness' to give them the perfect mouth feel.   They were generous with the shrimp and they were cooked well.  My only gripe, and it's a small one, is that the shrimp were a bit on the salty side (this seems to be a trend lately in several restaurants I've visited).    My wife had the Forentine Omlette.  It's a simple dish with spinach, gruyere cheese and some tomatoes.  The omlette was cooked perfectly and the ingredients were fresh.  Since she's vegan, and without her even having to mention it, they substituted a fresh and generous fruit cup for the hash browns.  The other couple also thoroughly enjoyed their meals.  The grilled meatloaf (yes, this is really a thing) was delicious as were the sides.  The Eggs Benedict looked beautiful but I'm just not a fan of Hollandaise sauce so I didn't try it.  The prices were what I call 'Scottsdale' reasonable.  Less expensive than the hotel restaurants but a little more than a Fridays or Cheesecake Factory.  That said, the food was far better than at either of those restaurants so I consider it a good value.  Overall, it was an absolutely lovely lunch experience and it will be a go to place for us.",

Make sure to make reservations when going there otherwise you are waiting a long time. Parking was horrendous, we circled the parking lot at least 6 time trying to find a spot, was almost late for our reservation. All the food came out at separate times at least 10 minutes apart, it was awful to have some people eating and some waiting for their food.

Our waiter was very friendly and on top of everything. The bread was warm and tasted like a sweet roll - amazing! The meatballs are a newer menu item and were cooked excellent. The Hemingway Florentine was great and just the right amount of food to be filling. The steak was cooked perfectly as well as the burger. We subbed a side for Mac and cheese, which was another great dish. Finally, we ended with one of their amazing desserts with the butter cake which was to die for!!! I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone!",

Kristen the bartender is a doll and pours the perfect amount of wine... enough to make you come back again and again and again.  The happy hour prices were freaking amazing.  Half off glasses of wine!?  Small plates on special!? YES PLEASE!!  We had the hummus which stands out from any you will ever try.  The chipotle tacos were so spicey that I learned today that the only way to off set that burn is by asking Kristen for a pack of sugar to quench the pain.  I highly recommend and will definitely be back!!",

That makes you wonder if everyone internal thinks the business is run bad, what should I think?  Onwards to service, we got water right when we sat down and then we ordered food (breakfast burrito and French toast). Burrito was good the French toast on the other hand was served raw, and wrong. It's so wrong that Gordon Ramsey would have a field day. It was so bad, the manager looked at it, and knew it was raw. The server was nice but could tell the difference between a good French toast and what we served.  We sent it back and got Belgium waffles, and another mush. They weren't cooked all the way, not even golden brown. Good food but badly run business. I doubt I'd stop in for breakfast and I wouldnt  order anything complex. Jay the manager didn't stop by after the second time.",

If you don't take care of your customers, somebody else will! My friend raved, but you've Lost some regulars. Too much competition for this kind of Nonsense!

I chose the Pulled Pork Street Tacos-they were on soft flour corn tortillas seasoned with Mexican spices, shredded lettuce, and pico de Gallo.They came with black beans and rice.It was so fresh and delicious. My friends had the southern shrimp and grits-it had applewood smoked bacon, mushrooms, green onions, garlic, anson mills organic stone ground grits with gruyere cheese. They loved it!   All of their entrees looked really good-burgers, sandwiches, fish, vegetarian choices too.  We sat in the bar but didn't have much time as we had to get to the airport but it looked like a really fun place. Their desserts sounded delicious too!

It is a pretty solid place that spits out a pretty good array of food such as burgers, salads, steaks, fish, sandwiches etc. etc. etc.  I don't think they specialize in anything.  I've probably tried just about every type of thing they offer and it is always good but not spectacular or memorable.  The one thing I do love about this place is the service.  Everyone is very very helpful and friendly every time I've been here.  I'm not sure why but I think it is because a much older demographic frequents this place who they tend love overly friendly service.  Also, this place tends to get pretty busy around dinner time so you may have to wait 15-25 mins to be seated so make reservations if you are able.",

Absolutely delicious.  I had a day to myself last week so took myself to lunch and decided to go for an awesome burger. WOW. I thought I was in a different restaurant. I asked for my burger without mayo. It came with mayo and to my horror, the waitress took the top bun off my plate with her hands and then came back with a new top.  There were about 10 fries, wilted and lukewarm. I guess at 1:00pm I got the leftovers from the crowd.  The burger was simply not good and the server was worse.

I often get the mustard pepper burger. It's good. I dig it. No matter what I get though, I ALWAYS order the home made chips. I've been a fan of home made chips since I first had them at Goldie's a million years ago. I'll get these wherever they have them. Village Tavern does a good rendition.   Yesterday I got the crab cake sandwich which was also quite good. I also had a bowl of clam chowder. It wasn't awesome but it did the job.  I will say that for some reason I like the crazy lemonade they do & can't get enough of it. It's got like a tiny bit of carbonation to it. While I wasn't sure if I even liked it at first, it's grown on me & I'll go at least 3 or 4 deep at a minimum.  The other thing I do dig there is the crab dip appetizer. Again, it's nothing unbelievable but I've just come to like it.  So while I wouldn't offer the Village Tavern up if people were asking about great food, it kind of has a weird place in my heart and we go there quite a lot for work meetings.",

    "text": "I admit it...I like potato chips:)  Back when there was about 60 pounds more of me to love, you could say I really liked potato chips:)  But still, if you are looking at the classic \"nutrition pyramid\"...potato chips are stuffed in there at the tippy top, along with perfectly grilled bone-in rib eye's, single malt scotch whiskey and Dungeness crab legs...all good things and good for you, too:)  At the Village Tavern, they have an appetizer called Colorado Potato Chips...freshly fried potato chips...with a bunch of junk on them.  But, if you ask them nicely, they will bring you just a plate of the chips, all fresh and warm and salty, right out of the fryer...without all the rest of the toppings:)  Now that's an accompaniment:)  A grace note, if you will:)  The Beautiful Carin and I stopped by the other evening... we hadn't been there in several months, and Sarah G's review reminded me that I have missed the good old Village Tavern.  They pour a nice drink at the VT and have a \" 1/2 price on any and every drink\" Happy Hour, so we had a couple of inexpensive KetelOne marti's and decided to have an early dinner:)  I had the Maple Cured Pork Chop and Carin had their Teriyaki Chicken...both were very good!  At VT, they also make a decent prime rib, some very serviceable burgers, a crab cake sandwich that really uses real crab and tastes like a crab cake should (no, it won't transport you to Newport News, but it's good:), and a Chinese Chicken Salad that always seems to draw me in:)  I've had all of these menu items before (and several other items as well) and never had a bad meal:)  In other words...good, solid tavern/road house fare...except for the chips:)  They transcend the genre and make VT a place worth returning to from time to time (not too often...got to watch the cholesterol:)  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service has always been very pleasant and friendly:)  I never feel that the staff is trying to \"optimize\" me or turn the table quickly.  And finally, in a rare \"double\", I need to give a five star shout out to the Village Clubs...by showing my membership card for the Village Clubs at VT, I get a 15% discount on the entire bill:)  I know...it's a chain and I do like to buy local, but come on...Village Tavern has those potato chips...Fresh, Warm, Perfect Potato Chips!  Potato Chips...Just when I thought I was out...they pulled me back in:)",

I la la la loved the food here, used to dine in regularly and happy hour often until.   Dun dun dun dun, one evening my girlfriends and I rendezvous at the Tavern for a little happy hour. It was not happy and we left in well under an hour. Just after being sat in the bar area we saw the biggest freakin rat. It would have made NY proud!   We packed it in and disappeared into the night never to return. :( Sad tale for a place I loved so much. It's like breaking up with someone you still have feelings for but you know it's the right thing to do.",

Food was fine but the lack of attentiveness and overall demeanor of the server will prevent me from coming here for quite awhile. What really fries me is when the bussing of the tables is slow. And that was the case here. Also, instead of letting us relax and order drinks the server took our drink and dinner orders at same time. Take the drink order first and let us look at the menus, please. It was a Saturday night (early) and perhaps the staffing was not sufficient.",

    "text": "We are long time customers of The Village Tavern and we dine there just because, for special occasions and when we have out-of-town guests. On Sunday, Aug 5th 2018, I had a 6 pm reservation for 4 people. It was for a birthday celebration and all of us were very much looking forward to a great experience. My husband and I arrived early. We checked in with the hostess and went into the bar, ordered cocktails and awaited the arrival of our friends. When our friends arrived, they ordered cocktails and we proceeded to enjoy some lighthearted conversation. At precisely 6:05 pm a man brusquely approached our group and told us that our table was ready and we needed to be seated or it would be given to someone else. The man had no name tag and did not introduce himself. Our friends and I hurriedly left the bar and went to the hostess desk to be escorted to our table, my husband staying behind to settle the bill. At the hostess desk I asked who the man was and explained what had just transpired. I was informed that he was the manager and that the restaurant has a policy that guests must be seated within 15 minutes of their reservation time or their table would be reassigned - never been told this before. Please note that our reservation time was 6 pm and it was 6:05 when we were approached. The restaurant did not appear busy as there were several empty tables in the bar area and no one was waiting in the lobby to be seated. When we went into the dining room I noted that there were numerous available booths and tables. In fact, in the area where I had requested to be seated there were no fewer than 5 empty booths.  I'm extremely unhappy with how we were treated by the manager. At the very least, he should have been wearing a name tag or introduced himself when he approached us. I feel that had he explained the policy and given us the option of being seated immediately or choosing a different table there would be no issues. We were not causing a seating delay for anyone and I don't quite understand his need to exert his control.  Other than the manager's actions, our dining experience was pleasant. The bartender was a True delight, provided us with excellent service and answered all of our questions about the drinks she was mixing. Our server was equally delightful and we truly enjoyed our interaction with her. I'm guessing that we will return. Hopefully the manager we encountered on Aug 5th will be off that night.",

The Chicken Mexican salad had almost all beans but little lettuce. When I asked my server what was going on, she told me that they are trying to save money. I will try going again in a few days and see if it is the same story. Today I ate my prime rib sandwich without the bread because there was very little mat to put on it. Come on Village Tavern, I have never had a negative experience here, your servers are great, I love the ambiance but once you start cutting corners, that spells the end.",

Needless to say I was shocked so I asked the hostess if he was for real ? She was very nice and led me to the employees bathroom, no problem!! But seriously the manager on duty on Friday Oct. 13th needs to be a little nicer especially those that continue to dine there.

Sadly last night was not at all how I had remembered it.  Service was great, as we waited we were offered a beverage and our waitress was good and a kind gentleman who was leaving the bar area was kind enough to give us his table. But that unfortunately can't make up for the terribly over cooked food we received which frankly should have never been allowed to leave the kitchen like that.   I ordered their salmon entree which was served with coscous which was mushed together so much it resembled the pan it had been it and it was cold when served. The salmon was so over cooked that it was beyond dry and was almost more like eating chicken than a delicious filet of salmon. My boyfriend ordered the chicken Marsala and his was like sandpaper. He did enjoy the spinach salad and the other plus was wine was half off on Wednesdays!  I was just really disappointed in the quality of the food I received.",

We partially needed the bread just so we would have more time to look over the large selection of food. I ordered the fried calamari as a starter and it was seriously the best calamari I have ever had. The sauce was very flavorful with a little bit of heat. For my main dish, I ordered the Tavern Flatbread. I had asked for no peppers, but when it came the peppers were there and pepperoni was missing. I was not going to say anything but the server remembered that I asked for the peppers off. I told the server it was okay and I would just pick them off. However, the manager came over, took that item off the bill and then assured me that another flatbread would be made. They put that in a to go box for me and I was all set. The food was good and the customer service was excellent. I really enjoyed the trip and will definitely be coming back.",

We spent some time in the bar area and then was seated. Our waiter, David, at first was nice, attentive, and seemed at first that we were going to have an amazing evening. We ordered another round of drinks and out food and waited and waited longer and even longer.  David returned and said their computer system crashed and he did not know what to do but everyone was on the issue.  He brought us bread and we waited. We could see the bar and the bartender was still pouring drinks. David returned and we asked him about our drinks at least. He had a perplexed look on his face as if he did not know how to do anything the old fashion way.  We eventually went to the bar and got our own drinks.  We finally received our food and it was mediocre, nothing as far as a wow factor.  David bought our dessert and we were appreciative of that.  It sounds like the computers were still down when we left and they we still having issues in communicating with the kitchen.  Not sure if we will return or not as they are many places to eat.  It is sad when a business and its team members do not have a back-up plan for these situations and even sadder when patrons are not properly compensated when this happens during dinner.  Thank you.",

At nearly $30, they called it a Delmonico Ribeye, I ordered it Medium Rare. After a 30 minute wait, it came out RAW!. Sent it back and they brought me a brand new steak ALSO RAW!! Third time, it was adequately cooked, but the meat was tough as nails and had too much gristle. This was unlike any Delmonico or Ribeye I've ever seen, which should be buttery soft and juicy by definition. The waitress and hostess could not have been more apologetic or accommodating (They comped my whole meal except for my drink), but the fact remains that one of their most expensive top of the line steaks was simply not good quality meat.

They came to the table with half a flat bread stating half of it was over done and they didn't want to serve it so they gave her the good side to eat while they made her a new one. The waiter didn't package my leftovers,  it was no big deal to me but the next thing I know he gave me a new half order to take home. The staff and waiter went beyond to make it nice.  Last thing. You have to have the Butter Cake it's excellent.",

So we're trying to enjoy our meal at our table when a group came outside. They were immediately rude about there not being any seats available. They sat there and watched us eat, glaring at us the entire time. Another group came out and actually came up to our table and asked for it. WE WERE EATING. The first group was also rude to my boyfriend's grandmother when we got up. They told her she shouldn't have sat there. So due to your open seating policy on your patio, this is 2 stars (it would have been 5). Change it. No more open seating in the patio area. Do you want people to feel uncomfortable as they're approached by waiting customers and glared at? I hope not.",

If you're in the area, and want very fresh and tasty food at a very reasonable price....please give Village Tavern a shot.  You will not be disappointed!",

My lunch was good but I have to admit that three days later I don't remember what I ordered. You can tell I like the meatloaf lol.   I did try the cream brulee for dessert and it was great but the apple cobbler was phenomenal. Once again not my food.   I'd recommend trying this place and on Wednesday they have half price wine.

Was craving comfort food on Saturday after a long work day. I was looking for meatloaf, chicken pot pie, or Swedish meatballs. Was having a hard time finding anywhere near by that had any of these options or would be satisfactory to satisfy the craving. Then I saw Village Tavern pop up again - and grilled meatloaf with the right fixins on the side? Yes. Please. Comfort food galore.  All the other reviews about the meatloaf are legit. You can see perfect grill marks on the meatloaf, it isn't greasy or too tough. And it's a very unique way to cook meatloaf.  Had great flavor, was moist and delicious, and that mushroom sauce served on top was dynamite (kinda fulfilled the Swedish meatball taste). I ordered a side of Mac and cheese as well to go an extra step for the comfort food cravings....and it was worth it!   Oh, and service? Impeccable.   I'm headed towards becoming a regular here. I want to try everything on their menu!",

    "text": "My husband and I really enjoyed our recent visit here.  We decided to do a last minute road trip for Memorial Day Weekend from OC, CA to Scottsdale, AZ.  My husband has been to the Village Tavern before but many years ago, telling me that the prime rib is really good.  We went around lunch time and were quickly seated at a booth, we were warmly greeted, the restaurant is large but homely and warm feeling.  Everything seemed clean and well maintained.  Our server John was great, very friendly and attentive.   We ordered the clam chowder and french onion soup to start, both were great but the clam chowder was really good.  We both ordered the prime rib, I had the smaller one with mash potatoes and sauteed spinach, my husband ordered the larger portion with fries and green beans.  Both we asked for medium rare.  Food came out promptly but immediately we could see the steaks were more medium well than medium rare but we know that it is difficult to cook perfectly.  The steaks were seasoned well but did taste more cooked than we would normally like it to be.  The mash potatoes and fries were great.  The spinach and green beans were both over salted but more so the spinach - they were inedible.   We very casually explained to John when he asked us how our food was that the spinach was too salty, he apologized, spoke to the kitchen manager and they gave us my orange juice on the house.  We felt that was a nice gesture and were happy with that.  For dessert we ordered the warm butter cake....oh boy, simply to die for! It was so good, if we weren't so full we would have ordered another!  Overall we really enjoyed our dining experience and would definitely recommend it to others and go back ourselves if we are ever in the area again",

The place is huge...slightly impersonal. but our waitress made up for that vibe. she was very attentive and gave great recommendations. I had the sea bass with sticky rice drizzles with soy sauce and wilted garlic spinach with ginger.  the meal was pretty great....but the stay of it as far as i'm concerned was the spinach. the ginger addition was such a surprise and i LOVED it. so much so that i have been looking up different recipes and takes on this so I can recreate at home. the rice was the perfect consistency and the bass was flaky and flavorful. overall i liked this restaurant a lot!  if you're in the area...definitely worth checking out.",

Tonight was our third and final attempt to continue choosing it for a quick, delicious, full service, enjoyable evening out.  We have been seeing changes in recipes...smaller portions, the amount of blue cheese on salads, changes in service, and general attention to detail.  All somewhat subtle changes, but nevertheless changes.  Our bread tonight was SO stale we could not tear the roll apart.   It took a serrated steak knife.  We ordered salad and filet (our usual) and received all items at the same time. Usually salad is served first.  Our steak was cold - meaning it had probably been sitting out for a while.  We are so disappointed.  As one of the previous negative reviews stated....the customer was told when she asked what was going on, was that they were trying to save money.  All these money saving techniques may not be in your best interest.    We are not alone in our feelings.  Goodbye!",

The salmon burger was very yummy. I do not usually like salmon burgers but this was one probably one of the best I've had. The wine selection seemed great too.

    "text": "We're not regulars but more accurately described as \"occasional(s)\" to this Scottsdale heirloom. However, every time we come we're happy we did. Zachary gave excellent service, the filet was medium rare as ordered and tender tender tender. The new \"bricked chicken\" was excellent, almost had that \"confit\" texture and taste, along with excellent mashed potatoes and green beans that were cooked but with enough of a snap left in them to retain the best flavor. The sauteed spinach was just barely cooked and was equally excellent.   The only fault I found was the bread, the rolls were too \"doughy\" and while they may have been \"made and baked on the premises\" they didn't live up to expectations....should have a better bread offering.   No appetizer, 2 glasses of wine, two entrees, one shared dessert (complimentary for a birthday!) and we couldn't have eaten another item. Total was $75 plus tax and tip....very reasonable for a steak house offering this quality. Ratings below expect a \"cheap\" or \"mid range\" or \"fine dining\" and while some wouldn't consider $75 a mid range - I believe it is based on ambiance and value rather than $$ alone.",

Unfortunately we never had a chance to try the food or experience the service. Our hostess was cold and uninspired and after sitting for over 10 minutes, without even a greeting, we decided to leave.  Lots of process breakdowns and unacceptable customer service lead to this rating and with the volumes of great restaurants in the area with focus on customer service, this is one that can be missed.  The management apologized and attempted to remedy the situation as we got into our car, but by that time it was too late as there seemed to be a lack of focus on a basic greeting and we will be with you shortly or let me ask my fellow teammates to help me while I am busy.  Not the kind of place that makes you feel welcome.  Maybe it was a bad time of day, or bad set of circumstances, but you need to be prepared for operating hours.",

I'm so glad my friend suggested it because it was by far, the best lunch I've had in a while. 1st off, our servers name was Lori and she was outstanding! She was so incredibly accommodating with all my special requests. I loved it! She made a few recommendations for us and Nick went with the BLT with pimento cheese spread. Bacon was a bit sweet, cheese spread was delicious and the tomato and lettuce were crisp and fresh. We started with the amazing french onion soup. Nice broth, creamy cheese and great flavor. I had this pimento,bacon burger but got a blackened chicken breast instead of a burger. I asked for sweet potato and regular fries mixed and Lori got my order all correct. We got some creme brulee to top off this fantastic meal and it was a tad boozy...we couldn't pin point the flavor but maybe it was rum? Awesome nonetheless. Our mango ice-t was kept full, our bill came in a timely manner and Lori was super pleasant. Nick pointed out that we could eat here all the time and not order the same thing twice!

They were the consistency of tuna salad with a little crust on the outside from pan-frying. A very bad excuse for crab cakes. My husband had a burger, which was decent. He ordered the Mac & Cheese for his side and it was terrible. Really soupy and had a strange flavor. Almost like there was mayonnaise in it. He didn't even eat it, and he will usually eat any Mac & cheese. We ordered gluten free pasta with butter and Parmesan for my son and the pasta was crunchy and stuck together. The only good thing we had was the broccoli side for him. We left the meal feeling gross.  Had some cocktails which were fine. On a positive note, our server was good.  On the drive home, we joked, \"At least it was only $100!\"  Yes, $100 for a bad meal.   Will never go back and do not recommend.",

Both occasions was treated w/ the same polite, helpful & professionally accomod8ing service!      Both Xs were during the evening tho the 1st trip was earlier & the 2nd was l8r. Had a reserv8ion trip 1 & just showed up the 2nd time (spontaneous decision after a walking out of the Melting pot around the way ~ a l8er review). Regardless, got us seated rather promptly @ a nice comfy booth (which I really needed @ the time cuz I was contending w/ some back issues as well then) + near the cozy fireplace was a nice added bonus!     The ambiance has an inviting homey cabin/cottage~type feel w/ a combin8ion of cobblestone & wooden beam paneling somewhat similar 2 Le Chalet & some Claim Jumper's interior. Romantic, intim8, upscale & @ the same time casual enough 2 not feel out of place if dressed down like I was on my 2nd visit. Luv these kind of atmospheres where anything goes!     I've had the Spinach salad both Xs & I have 2 say as long as they still have it on their menu, I'd make a trip just 4 this alone! It is THAT AWESOME & is the most unexpectedly complimentary combin8ion of flavors, that it is the Absolute BEST salad I've EVER had & I've seriously partaken of countless kinds that couldn't hope 2 even b a contender by comparison!! Spinach salad has grape tom8toes, green apples, dried cranberries, spiced pecans, sliced egg, crumbled blue cheese & bacon w/ poppyseed dressing (Of course there were a couple ingredients I didn't have on mine) but would gladly pay double the price!!      French onion soup is Superb & I can't get enough of their sweet potato fries!! (which I attribute 2 assist in ridding the migraine as I felt much better after having them). Also can't go wrong w/ the bruschetta & the spaghetti squash/zucchini is another gr8 dish 4 Veg~heads as well as their margherita pizza & the fresh or blackened salmon or hot crab dip if ur a pescetarian. They also have a veggie burger which I have yet 2 try & I can't account 4 their other desserts yet, but the Creme Brulee is a savory 4bidden treat! Would come here more often if it were closer 4 me, but I have nothing but glowing remarks 4 this place!!",

    "text": "The Village Tavern is a beautiful restaurant in the heart of Scottsdale, not too far from Old Town.  The menu has many very attractive offerings and a large elegant bar area for waiting.   I've dined at the Tavern twice, once with poor results and thought I would try it again, any restaurant can have an off night, right?  Well, two off nights months apart note a trend that is typically an accurate reflection of the restaurant.   On both occasions, a member of my party ordered a steak, first time it was a New York with bearnaise sauce and the second time, a filet mignon with a horseradish sauce. Both times the steaks were ordered medium well done, not my style, but one in my dining party.  On both occasions the steaks were initially served rare to medium rare, extremely red (not pink) in the middle. A steak is something that is fairly straight forward to cook and if a line chef cannot accurately gauge the doneness of meat, then what other mistakes are being made in the kitchen and more so, what is so difficult about cooking a steak?  I mean, if your a professional chef this should be cooking school 101, right?    So, for the price of a NY at $30 bucks plus sides and the sauce, which puts a plate price around $40 bucks, your much better off at one of the myriad of other \"fine\" dining establishments in Scottsdale.  To think of a few, Cowboy Ciao, Roaring Fork, Citizen's Public House and the list goes on and on...think twice before dropping some coins in this deposit box.",

    "text": "First visit to Village Tavern tonight.  Less than auspicious start --- seated ourselves in lounge area, which is open seating, first come/first serve -- and after 10+ min. of not being waited on and greeted, got up and were walking out.  Mentioned to mgr., Jesus, who happened to be on patio talking w some customers a few ft. away, that we would have loved to have dined with them tonight, but were leaving due to no one serving us.  Without hesitation, and very apologetic, Jesus offered to take care of our meals if we decided to stay, which after some coaxing, we did.  And I am happy to report what a good decision that really was.    Meals were excellent --- filet mignon for myself, and ribeye for my son, w sides of asparagus and Mac n cheese, which was flavorful, one of the best we've ever tasted.  Service also excellent.  Our server, Jonathan was outstanding, extremely knowledgeable and not afraid to pass along his recommendations, from wine, to appetizer salad, to meals, which I very much appreciate in a server, especially when dining somewhere for the first time.    Full menu with many possibilities.  Whatever you're in the mood for --- steak/prime rib, seafood, burgers, wonderful salads (highly recommend the Tavern Salad), diverse selection of appetizers, great wine/beer selections, and all of these, surprisingly reasonable, considering the quality, and amt. of food you get.  You are warned!  Portions are aplenty!  Ambiance is also excellent in the Village Tavern.  Lively atmosphere, but person sitting across from you easily heard.  We will be back to the Village Tavern, and very soon.  Thank you, Jesus, and Jonathan, for a wonderful first experience, outstanding meals, outstanding service.",

My friend was not happy with the greasiness of the fish, however I did not mind. Our server was friendly and the service we received was adequate. The stand out highlight of the evening however, was the warm butter cake with ice cream for dessert. We didn't even know that it came with ice cream until the plate showed up at our table, and the dessert was easily enough to be shared by 2 ppl! If it were not for that dessert, I would probably only leave two stars. That cake DEFINITELY made up for a lackluster meal!",

Our large table ordered the deviled eggs appetizer and they gave us a basket of rolls with butter. $4 mimosas, blood Mary's and Bellinis for brunch. I ordered the crab cake Benedict and the poached egg was cooked perfectly. it really hit my brunch spot. The whole table ordered a variety of things. No one complained about the quality of the food. We were all pretty quiet for a bit just eating our food! Service was a little slower than we liked but it was super busy. I will say that the demographic of the place was a little on the mature side.",

My husband and I are now HUGE fans. Thom got the Marinated Flank Steak. It's served over black beans and a side of the most delicious sweet garlic soy sauce that I am DYING to find a recipe for. I got a new item on their menu, the Bacon Jam Burger. I am obsessed with bacon jam and not all of them are good. Village Tavern's is GREAT. My only complaint is THERE WAS TOO LITTLE OF IT.  Of course there was also some applewood smoked bacon on the burger, because there is no such thing as too much bacon.",

Our waitress was so nice and did a great job of answering our questions. I ordered the grilled teriyaki chicken with an extra side of vegetables, and my husband ordered the BLT. My chicken was dry but I asked for some extra teriyaki sauce and then it was great. The stir fry vegetables were delicious. My husbands BLT was the one downfall of the meal - it only came with ONE strip of bacon! One strip on a huge sandwich! He showed this to our waitress who then brought him three more bacon strips, which was nice of her, but how can you serve a huge BLT sandwich with only one piece of bacon? Once he added the extra bacon, it was delicious, although the cheese spread on it was extremely heavy and over powering. I can't wait to come back and have more French onion soup. I think I would try a flatbread or a different sandwich next time, as we weren't insanely impressed with either of our entrees.",

We took the table on the patio. We loved the setting especially the patio area. Happy hour starts at 4-7; drink starts from $5. We ordered red wine & a cocktail. The happy hour menu is exceptional. 1/2 rack pork ribs ($9) & a salmon & shrimp plate ($9) The prices are very reasonable & the menu has other good happy hour food items too; such as fish tacos & prime rib sliders. (All $9) When the drinks came, it's a generous portion of glass of wine & a tasteful cocktail with grey goose vodka. The food is also great, comes with a good portion of ribs & a chilled sampler of shrimp, salmon & Brie cheese. Delish!!! Very impressed. Service is pretty prompt. Next time we will try their dine in restaurant.",

    "text": "We have been regular customers at the Village Tavern ever since the restaurant opened, and I would never have given them anything but 5 stars in the past; however.............This time was different. It started with our call to make a reservation.  Our son is in town and we asked for a 5:30 reservation.  The person that answered the phone said that they were full, and that the only time available was either 4:45PM or after 8PM.  Let me tell you that when we arrived (just before 4:45) the parking lot was nearly empty, as was the restaurant.  The hostess said that we could have come in and gotten a table at 5:30; a fact that she omitted when we were on the phone.  Then there was the waiter..Zarco P.  As many times as we have been to this restaurant, we have never had a worse server.  My son and I ordered a glass of wine.  It is customary that they serve the wine in a carafe and provide you with a glass (and we saw him serve it that way to other tables), but he brought us a very scant glass of wine.  No big deal; just not as we expected.  My husband and I ordered a large prime rib split, cooked medium with a baked potato and asparagus.  When the food was served, it was cold.  We debated about sending it back, but decided to send it back because neither of us enjoy cold food.  Zarco took it back, but re-delivered the same meat heated (somehow) but now it was well done.  He delivered the same cold potato and asparagus.  When my husband commented that the meat was well done, Zarco just shrugged and walked away.  This is not the standard of food and service that we have come to expect at the Village Tavern.    When we return, we will ask NOT to have that server.",

As for food, I ordered the Prime Rib, with Mac-N-Cheese and a Loaded Baked Potato as my two sides.  They have one of the best Prime Ribs in town!  It was cooked perfect as I ordered it Medium Rare.  The rest of my party ordered a Cheeseburger, Blackened Chicken Alfredo Pasta, and a Filet Mignon.  Everybody really enjoyed their meals as well.

Since we are all former coworkers, it's a great way to socialize and get caught up with one another. Two of the group loves going to the Village Tavern since they live near it in Scottsdale.  First tip: make sure you make a reservation! We did and I'm glad. This place is a definite favorite with the snowbirds and retirees. There is a lot of seating around the bar, a separate dining room, and the patio but it fills up quickly. It was packed.  It's American style food. But you have a great selection. You can have so many different appetizers and flat breads, street tacos, burgers and sandwiches, well-known salads and soups. They have seafood, steaks. The Kitchen will even have prime rib specials some days. Their beverage list is long and well-rounded. Our server Colin, was very knowledgeable. He even steered us towards the triple berry martini and it was spot on. Without alcoholic drinks, your bill will probably come to about $25 pp If you stay away from the higher end items ie:surf and turf.Specialty drinks are about $10 plus each.  Creme Brulee was delicious. My friend had the very best, carrot cake which they are known for and she gave it 2 thumbs up.  The diners all looked happy and it was very nice to see that most were conversing without their dreaded cell phones out.  Everyone looked like they were having a great time.  I have already recommended this place to one of my friends who is out visiting with her family over spring break. They enjoyed it very much.",

I had family coming into town so before they came, my husband and I decided to stop in for a quick bite. The waitress we first had was PHENOMENAL. She told us about the specials and frequently returned to make sure everything was going well. The food was delicious and everything was hot and well prepared.  Then, my family got in early and decided to meet us there. We moved to a larger table where Colin took over. That's when things took a turn for the worse. He tried to impress us with wine selections and menu choices and was a bit pushy. The service was awful. Waited for drinks for a good 10-15 minutes which was insane because it was dead on a Wednesday night at 8:30. We constantly had to remind him to bring us drinks and frequently ran out and had to wait for him to show up.   I would like to come back because the food really was great. Everyone in my family was impressed however, the service needs a bit of an upgrade. At least for this individual anyway.",

Although he made a mess all over the floor, they didn't seem to mind and (more importantly) didn't make me feel uncomfortable for it. They provided us with great service and made sure our food was delivered promptly.   P.S. Their Kid's Pizza is HUGE!!! It could literally feed an adult. So yes, I ate some as well.",

We started off with the crab cake appetizer which was okay. The crab cake was not as firm as I would have liked, but it was good enough to enjoy. It was placed on top of a garden green salad.  My wife ordered the medium rare Filet Mignon <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fCJrZIzz85_8Uhf072QVnA?select=R1hK7SL71GbWVDCju15H2A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fCJr...</a> and I had the medium rare prime rib. We both had the wedge salad which was the perfect size, not to large.   Asked her how she liked it, said it was burnt on the outside and a tad bit over cooked. As you can see, my was cooked perfectly.  We topped the meal off with a Banana Crepes. It was more like ice cream crepes because the two crepes were wrapped around vanilla ice cream. The bananas were on the bottom split in half and made into a tic tac toe design, topped with the ice cream crepes then a scope of vanilla ice cream was place on top. It was drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauces. I should have taken a picture of it, but I was so amazed at the dessert that I grabbed my spoon and started digging in.  The place was a bit loud and the table and booth arrangment reminded us of Houston's Restaurant.",

The size of the menu was overwhelming which makes me believe with a menu this size they could not possibly have the freshest food nor a prepare quality food, which is what our experience was. All of our entrees were server lukewarm instead of hot and really were not that good. Service was mediocre and the restrooms had not been checked for quite a while with trash overflowing. I now understand why on a Saturday night there were not many dining guests in the restaurant but then I wonder who is writing the glowing reviews.",

We tried the pimento cheese deviled eggs which were disappointing to me because I really love both of those foods separately. The consistency was not to my liking and it basically tasted only like cheese.  I ordered the ahi tuna salad, which I have had before, but this time I felt like my tuna should have been colder considering its almost raw. It don't want to eat room temperature tuna. We ordered a few sides for my child to eat and I loved how thin the apples were sliced. It was easy for him to eat by hand and they were so fresh.  I do enjoy the vibe of the restaurant though. The dining area is dimmed and not to noisy.  Plus you can pretty much wear anything in there, which I find a pleasant change from many Scottsdale restaurants because I don't always want to get dressed up to eat.",

First, this tavern gets super busy. The place was packed when we had lunch yesterday. It's a mixed crowd of folks but I was particularly fond of the older ladies playing cards after eating their lunch.  We started lunch off with a quesadilla appetizer. Huge chunks of chicken, cheesy, delicious. I then ordered their onion-mushroom burger for lunch. The burger was cooked just how I wanted it but it was seriously lacking in flavor. Perhaps the salt gods are getting to me from the home cooking. Kudos for keeping it fresh (so I think) but I just didn't find the burger to be too tasty. It's not like me just eating a little over half of my meal but that's where I left it. And it really wasn't a hunger thing either because I hate to leave food on the plate.  I wouldn't mind going back as I'm sure there are plenty of good options but I don't think I'll be choosing a burger.",

Keeping it simple was the plan so, Wedge Salad, 10 oz. Filet and Baked Potato seemed like a good way to go.  The salad was an appropriate amount of fresh lettuce vs. the quarter of a huge head of iceberg some places serve.  It came with bacon and diced tomatoes and some very good blue cheese dressing.  The steak was cut somewhat thin and seemed small for a 10 oz. portion and was closer to medium than the medium rare I ordered.  This helped lead to a less than juicy piece of meat.  The baked potato was just fine as it's pretty hard to mess that up and came with butter and sour cream which was OK but it would have been nice to have been asked if I wanted that on top.  All in all, I give Village Tavern a high 3 stars and would be ok going back.  Not a destination place for me however in a town with the dining options Scottsdale has to offer.",

    "text": "Called tonight to make a reservation for 10 people outside to celebrate a very special event.  When we arrived, I was told by the hostess to put together my own table if I wanted to sit in the patio.  I was surprised so I asked her again if she wanted me to pull the tables together and she said yes unless she finds a busboy to do it.  We were sat at a table for 8 outside and given 4 menus.  The waitress then came over and told me that they really didn't want to add more tables unless I knew for sure other guests were coming as very often customers say that there will be more guests but they never show up.  I looked at her and thought to myself, is she for real!  I confirmed with her that in fact 4 more people were joining.  She never added the table, and 15 minutes had passed.  My friend and I moved over a round table to add more seating.  I asked the waitress for a tablecloth for the table and she gave me a very unhappy look.  I also requested more menus.  We soon placed our orders.  My husband's pork chops came 30 minutes after everyone had finished their food and half the table of guests had left (we were still charged for it). Waitress excuse was that when the cooks brought out the pork chops they were way too over cooked that she asked them to remake them.  My thought is that she forgot to put the order in.  At the end of our dinner, before presenting the check, the waitress became exceptionally sweet as if she was a different person.  She and the hostess had such a unwelcoming attitude towards us from the beginning, which was really too bad as we were all there to celebrate an occasion.  By putting up an act for the last few minutes before giving us a check was not going to make me want to give her a 20% tip.  I live very close to Village Tavern but will not return again.  I'm not sure if these people working today here were racist, but we sure felt like that. Just to add, my Dad asked for bread during dinner and the waitress told him that since it's closing time that she only had a few pieces left.  I looked at my watch and it was 9:20, the restaurant closes at 10.  It was a very disturbing experience, will never return!!! The whole group felt insulted by the end of the night!",

The food is consistently good and the things that I order the most are: french onion soup, bacon wrapped scallops, ahi tuna sashimi, or their spinach salad. I haven't had much experience with their dessert but have had their warm butter cake which is the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> and the chocolate torte which I have no opinion on because I am not a fan of chocolate.

I like this place, you can't go wrong.",

The ahi was just not good. Neither was the wine list. The shrimp taco's were marginal. So, you ask: Why did you order seafood? Sorry, my bad!  Service was nice, but am thinking with as many excellent restaurants as there are in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I can skip this spot.",

    "text": "Went to the Village Tavern for the first time last Wednesday, and I was extremely disappointed.                                  ATMOSPHERE (1/5) When you walk in, you begin to feel underwhelmed by the atmosphere, with an extremely musty smell, and stone floors which make the place extremely castle-like, along with the dim lights that make it nearly impossible to eat inside.   We decided to eat on the patio. What a disaster. The patio has misters that are way too strong, and, when we asked for the misters to be turned off, the misters started dripping on to our food!  The Village Tavern has a wide variety of dishes, with a large, but pricey menu of food and drinks.                                  SERVICE (2/5) For service, Village Tavern fell extremely short, as it took nearly 20 minutes just to get our drinks. The waitress (Quinn) had absolutely no knowledge of the menu, and was a bit sluggish too.                                      FOOD (1/5) For food, We ordered the Nacho Appetizer, which was standard and not phenomenal. The meat tasted as if it was processed, not to mention most of the vegetables on it were wilted and/or rotten.   One good thing was that they were able to modify the dish for my moms milk allergy, which meant a lot.   While waiting for our entrees, I stopped on by the bar. It was not very busy, however, I ordered some \"mock tails\", (Shirley Temples) for our family, which took over 5 minutes to come out. We all agreed that they must have not been mixed properly.   By the time I came back, our food was at the table. We ordered 2 salmon dishes, fries, and an order of Maryland Crab Cakes. Both salmon dishes were sub-par. The salmon itself was tender and juicy, but both dishes had very bad side orders. The fries that came with Salmon 1 were inedible, overcooked and definitely not fresh. The other side dish, cous cous, had chunks of ice upon ordering, which was gross.  The Maryland crab cakes were extremely greasy, a very small portion, and were presented sloppily as if the chef just threw them on the plate. The rice pilaf dish on the side was lukewarm and flavorless, and the sweet potato fries were extremely soggy.   We then spoke with the manager, who was nice, and we decided to order another menu item instead, a Club sandwich, with a baked potato and French onion soup. The Club sandwich was okay, most ingredients tasted fresh, besides the bread, which was clearly stale. The baked potato and french onion soup were decent, but I found the French onion soup to be overpriced and salty.  The highlight of the meal was definitely the deserts, both the raspberry sorbet and creme brulee had heavenly, luscious textures that definitely raised the rating from 1 to 2 stars, but with a bill of over $100, I won't be back. Village Tavern has potential, but the management really needs to step up their game.",

    "text": "Village Tavern is one of the places that I forgot I missed. I recently moved back to Scottsdale / Paradise Valley area and had lunch at Village Tavern with a business contact / friend. I really forgot how much I enjoy this place. It is old school upscale with the dark wood sort of country club feel. The space is large but not loud. It is easy to carry on a conversation. Good place for business or pleasure (if it's one in the same for you well, that's your business).  They also have a very nice bar area where I have previously had a nice beverage and appetizers.  For lunch I had the Greek Salad with grilled chicken breast and it was quite tasty. The portion was nice, chicken was juicy and some simple seasoning. The gal I met had their soup, and commented that she always get the soup there. I will say that the soup looked delicious and she did eat every last drop. The service was quite prompt so you could easily make it for an hour lunch however, I would recommend reservations. They do get quite busy which is generally a good sign. The wait staff was friendly and welcoming. The restroom was clean and well stocked. Parking was not so much of an issue because we went at 11:30 but I could see that parking could get quite full in this location.  The pricing is moderate and the food is tasty! Make a reservation and give it a whirl. So glad I was reminded of how good this place is.  Enjoy y'all!!",

Our server, \"Lisa M.\" Was friendly and efficient. My salad was fresh, crisp and tasty, we split it, pretty good size. I convinced my wife to get the 16 oz. Prime rib, hoping to share with her. I got the shrimp and grits. That piece of meat was huge, and had very little fat and waste as is common. We shared, still took half home for my breakfast. Shrimps were fresh, sweet and perfectly cooked, grits rather gritty, but tasty. Asked for and received the complimentary rolls and butter. Rolls were... not great. In the distant past, they were hot fresh Parker rolls. Now, crumbly, undercooked and disappointing. That wasn't enough to severely affect an otherwise well above average meal.  We will, no doubt, return.",

    "text": "We had a very odd experience getting Sunday brunch at Village Tavern. Arriving around 12:30, five of us were seated at a hi-top near the bar, next to the open patio. The weather was perfect and the table was great, we were excited to try the place as we had heard amazing things.   Our waitress appeared pretty quickly, taking drink orders and leaving us to browse the menu. They have extensive brunch and lunch offerings, so there is sure to be something for everyone. After some time, we placed our orders and continued chatting. This is where things started to go a bit downhill.   It took a pretty long time before soup and a crab cake appetizer came out. Only two in our party ordered a starter but I understand wanting that to come out before the main courses. However the time it took to even get the starters was how long I would have figured the main courses would take. They finished the starters and we continued to wait. During this time two of us had waters that were pretty low waiting to be refilled.   As we continued to wait the table started musing that it was taking a bit. Finally, one of us asked how much longer and we were advised by our waitress that they would be out in a few minutes, because she had to put the starters in first and then the main order later. There was a bit of attitude coming with the comment too. Like yes we get we had two who ordered starters but does that mean we can't inquire why it's taking forever?? While there were other people in the restaurant it was by no means packed.   Finally the food came out. The group had two chicken and waffles, a salmon salad, an omelet and another egg based dish. Overall the food was pretty good: great chicken, quality salad, and good breakfast potatoes. One odd thing was the chicken and waffles had different sized portions of chicken on top. One came with three tenders, the other with four that looked significantly larger. Neither of us even thought we could eat the larger portion anyways but it was weird that there was such a different. Didn't look like great consistency from the kitchen.   One members eggs were overdone and by the time he could flag down the waitress to let her know it was the end of the meal. She gave a very monotone/uncaring \"sorry\" and scurried off. Granted, a few moments later the chef (I assume) came out to apologize and took the dish off the check. While that was appreciated it was still almost too little too late, as we had been there for quite some time at that point.  We ended up leaving around 2:40pm. I've had long meals with many courses or meals that were long were due to lots of chatting and dessert ordering, but this was not one of those meals. While the food was generally decent, the slowness and lack of empathy or care from our server wasn't enticing. I'm not sure that I would return, although they did have promising dinner options on their menu. If it hadn't been for the food itself and the chefs apology, it wouldn't have even made three stars for our experience.",

It came with a side and you can actually pick other sides besides just the house potatoes, which was welcome service. The must get is the complimentary bread service - the bread was served hot and fresh and soft in the middle. It was amazing.   One of the better breakfast we have had in flavor and service.",

They do have happy hour but only at the bar or patio area.   So we sat in the restaurant area & we already looked over the menu on what we wanted so we got the tavern nachos with meat & beans on it as well. It was so huge! It was delicious too. Definitely recommend, especially it's shareable! Also I ordered the baby back ribs, my mom got the pork chop & aunt got the flank steak. The ribs were not that good, it wasn't really soft & falling off the bone type. Also the ribs were abit spicy. The pork chop was chewy. It came with asparagus & it was more thicker then other places. The flank steak was okay. The portions were huge, you can definitely share.   Also we asked for a sample of soup & she brought the minestrone & clam chowder, apparently you can't try the french onion. The minestrone was awful & the clam chowder was good.   Also I registered online to receive emails a week ago & still didn't receive an email from them cause during your birthday month they give you $10 off. I told the manager & he said he needs the code & to come next time with it.",

    "text": "I usually don't give bad reviews, but the way we got treated here was unheard of. I did not check  their Yelp page before coming here, but we were in the area and wanted to have brunch. We have a dog, and I specifically asked the hostess (before calling the rest of my party) if he was allowed on the patio. She said it wasn't a problem, so I called the rest of my party and they made their way to join me. The rest arrived, with our (small) dog and we were seated. Two other waiters saw us, and thought it was fine. They started cleaning our table, still no problem. Then, out of the blue, the dog being there became a problem. Please note that he wasn't making any noise, no reason for them to suddenly change their mind.  I understand that they have a \"no dog\" policy, and completely respect it. But if they messed up on their side(not one but three people did not protest the dog being there) they should be more apologetic about it. They kicked us out in a very rude and embarrassing way, and when I pointed out that the hostess told us it was ok, instead of apologizing, she became super defensive.   They really need to be more apologetic when they make mistakes. We weren't expecting to stay there if dogs aren't allowed, but there's a proper way to talk to customers. A simple \"We're so sorry, but we have a no dog policy\" would've gone a long way.  Will never come back there, and neither should anyone.",

Ordered a Filet Mignon lunch special with Asparagus and Sweet Potato Fries. Finished the meal with the Chocolate Tarte with Ice Cream. All very good. Everything was perfect until it took over 10 minutes to try and track down our server.. Our to-go food was also tossed instead of being boxed.

He basically called me a liar when I told him that I had been instructed an hour earlier by a young woman at his restaurant to call in when enroute and they will put our name on the wait list because this restaurant doesn't accommodate diners of small parties requests otherwise. When I called back to say we're on the way, another staff member kept me on hold for several minutes- by then we had just arrived into the parking lot- and then Chris picked up the phone identified himself as the manager. He insisted that if he were to believe me that his staff would actually tell me that they they would take my name, then I must prove it by stating the woman's name who had instructed me to call back in. OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!   As a local Scottsdale resident who has previously dined at Village Tavern, my business should be far more important than the flash-in-the-pan snowbirds who might happen by, because we support our Scottsdale restaurants all year round - even in the dead of summer.

Like many others, we always order the butter cake which has an amazing flavor.

I hopped on yelp in a hurry to find something around us that wasnt pretentious, full of hipsters, or overly \"new\". Don't get me wrong, I like unique, I love creative, i don't love trendy. Anyway. We liked into this place on a good yelp review. And I so glad we did. Not only did we go one night, but we went two. The first night was filled with spicy calamari, shrimp and grits, and shrimp tacos. The calamari... To die for. Not chewy, not soggy, just amazing. Fried pickled jalapenos? Umm yes please. Actually that was the only complaint... More of those would be good in there. My shrimp and gross was heaven, and the shrimp tacos surpassed expectation. And the bill? Not bad. Not bad at all. Night 2 was pimento cheese deviled eggs, delicious but not as magical as the calamari. I had flank steak and my husband had fish and chips. And then we had dessert (butter cake, which to me is just splendid) I just wanted to nap there. I had so much flank steak I had to feed half of it to my husband. And his fish was fabulous. Even the sides both nights were awesome. Black beans were tasty and not bland at all. So honestly, the food is awesome, the service was impeccable, and the bill was nothing to complain about. We both ate more than any person should have and it was good and it was under 100 bucks. (drinks, apps  dessert, entree) I know we will be back here again and again!",

    "text": "There is such a thing as \"Grilled Meatloaf\". And everyone should experience this wonder.  It's not my mother's meatloaf. (Shh! Sorry Mom. This is better. I'm really very sorry.)  Tucked on a corner of the The Shops at Gainey Village is a quaint little restaurant, complete with an outdoor patio.   Alas, the patio and I were not properly introduced as the super comfortable looking loungers and tables were already scooped up. Instead, my friends and I were greeted like friends at the bar and found three (count 'em, three) stools right in a row waiting for us.  I don't know if the patio is always this super busy, as this was the 1st Thursday of the month. There's music 1st Thursdays (until March of 2014) in the center area of the shopping area with different live bands.  I do know that reservations are not taken for the patio area. It's first come, first serve! So hurry kids, hurry! Those seats look mahhvelous.  Given how delish the food was I can understand why. Hoh Boy.  Our group took the hearty advice of Rick, a super bomb diggity bartender, and went with the \"hot crab dip\". The serving size is large and plenty for a group of three. If I were to attempt this at home I'd perhaps throw in a hint more spice. (Maybe a touch of celery.) But really, this gal was sassy pants happy scooping away at the dip. The provided copious amounts of toast to enjoy the dip which was rather nice.  My friends shared a Cobb Salad. I had to laugh at them. The serving size was gigantic. HUGE. I turned away the opportunity to sample what looked like a wonderful salad.   I was being single minded in my determination to eat AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE of my meat loaf. (My friends said the Cobb was very much to their liking. They eat out quite a bit, so I take their word for it.)  Grilling meatloaf put a new spin on it for me. Ok, fine. The menu does say \"Family Specialty\". I was majorly bummed this morning when I remembered my left-overs where not, in fact, in my apartment. They were sacrificed in the name of car pooling.  Yes, that happened. My heavenly grilled meat loaf was sent off to a better life. And I did not get to enjoy left-overs today.  I will go back to the Village Tavern and eat this again.  Thank you Rick the Bartender for a *great* recommendation!  (Also, you were a wonderful server!)  Oh! And the house red is a new friend of mine. (Five bucks!)   Can't go wrong here.  UPDATE! UPDATE! I sat on the patio! No wonder this spot is hard to come by. Very large area with super fine seating. Comfy. So comfy no one wants to get up :)   This time my visit was during a Sunday brunch slot. Boy! No joke. 11:30 is a popular time. We were super lucky and scored the last table. On a Saturday, I doubt this would ever happen. (I heard men dragging their families inside with, \"NO. We have to sit inside so I can watch \"the\" game.\" Yay for me! I mean, us. There was a group of us :)",

    "text": "I would give the Village Tavern 10 stars if I could. This is just one of those places that gets everything right. The food is outstanding and there is a lot of variety to choose from on the menu. You can literally get anything from appetizers to filet mignon. The decor is nice and comfortable and it was a fun and lively place to hang out. The service was excellent. Very friendly staff that we found ourselves chatting with often. Management comes by the table and asks if all is good. Prices are really affordable, especially for such great food. Wednesday was 1/2 price wine day and we were drinking really good glasses of wine for $4-5 each. The homemade flatbread pizza was amazing. It was more like a small east coast Sicilian pie. The pulled pork sliders were among the best I've had. Their burger was excellent. And the seared Ahi tuna appetizer was off the charts and almost enough to eat for lunch on its own. Just can't say enough good things about Village Tavern. I wish they had one near my home town. But for sure, I'll be back next time I'm in Scottsdale or should I visit one of their other locations.",

Steaks and prime rib sounded like the ticket, so we went on a Friday evening.  Large, nice place, and our server was a delight.  But the food (and relatively low prices) stole the show.  We started out with a Caprese salad that was very good - the tomatoes were every bit as tasty as heirlooms.  For our entrees,  my wife had grilled meatloaf, which was two large slices of meatloaf, grilled, topped with a mushroom Madeira sauce and served over smashed potatoes along with string beans.  I got the larger cut prime rib with smashed potatoes and spinach.  We both loved our dishes and washed it down with a decent inexpensive bottle of Shiraz.  We finished by sharing the carrot cake.  But despite the excellent food and service, everything was very reasonably priced.  We will be back!",

The wedge was good, even though I ordered the dressing on the side and it didn't come that way.  The pizza was also good, and I would recommend it.  My biggest complaint is that a pizza isn't considered an \"entree\".  The wedge salad would've been $2 cheaper had I ordered an entree.  When we asked our waitress about it she said the sandwiches, pizzas, and burgers aren't considered entrees.  That's quite misleading.  Now $2 isn't enough to not convince me to go back, but the principle of it is a little ridiculous.  We knew it wasn't the waitresses fault, and left it at that.  All in all, I will go back, but I don't think I'll get a salad unless I make sure I order an \"entree\".",

It was Scottsdale after all and I suppose folks were on vacation.  I had the prime rib because of the earlier reviews I'd read here.  Prime rib was very good.  Just came on a plate with a side of mashed potatoes.  Pretty boring but I was hungry.  I loved the wedge salad.  It was full of blu cheese and bacon.  I'd get that again.  Husband had the crab cakes.  He said it was just OK.  All in all, I'd go back.  But I'd sit in the bar and order off the bar food menu.  One thing I didn't like.

The food we had was excellent- blackened salmon sandwich w/ homemade chips, kids food was great, margarita pizza was amazing- the crust could be the best I've ever had.  Do yourself a favor and order the crab cake appetizer.... SO GOOD!  The calamari was also excellent, but the Thai chili sauce is what elevates the rather ordinary app to something memorable.  Just get a side of the sauce if you don't want to order of calamari!!  Key Lime Pie was great (better than I've ever made it) and the nutella & chunky monkey stuffed crepes were delicious, not my favorite but devoured non- the- less.  The best dish was the Shrimp & Grits.  Being from California, I don't see this on menus very often, and I like to order new things.  So glad I did.  It was unbelievable.  Shrimp, bacon, Gruyere, grits.... AMAZING!!  Bottom line- obviously we enjoyed the food... but the service and the staff were all very nice, informative & friendly.",

I was assured by the girl I spoke with we would have no trouble getting in with our group.  It was good that one person got there early... by the time I arrived (on time at 11:30 a.m.), there was already a wait.  Maybe they should consider taking lunch reservations, too, for everyone.  Prices are fair for the area and Scottsdale.  Wish there was more mid-price range places with excellent food. It seems like Scottsdale is loaded with bar food and high end restaurants.  This one fits the budget and has excellent food.  A reservation is essential for dinner.",

Stating she could not accept old IDs. This is True but my daughter had only turned 21 one week prior and according to law she has to use the old ID for up to 30 days and receive a new one asap. She has been accepted everywhere including old town Scottsdale bars and clubs. Even visited the DMV to confirm. Rolled her eyes at my family and claimed to get a manager and never did.

I checked the reviews here because this place is one of the few that I have dined at in Arizona that, for lack of a better phrase, left a bad taste in my mouth. As far as the food, I was never too impressed with that either, but the reviews say otherwise from my fellow Yelpers.    I will say that my last experience was so bad it prompted me to write the corporate office and they were responsive and sent me a $25 gift card.

The restaurant was hopping with visitors which is a great sign in this economy. They told us the wait would be about 20 minutes, but we weren't even half way done with our beers when they called our name, actually our beeper started buzzing.   The dining room is warm and welcoming. It's crowded in there but once you sit in your seat, you easily forget about those surrounding you. The booths are high and comfortable. The staffers are friendly and attentive but not overbearing.   For food, we began with the crab dip. It came out fresh, hearty and inviting us to dig into it. I liked to see how they gave us small bread slices instead of chips or a large chunk of bread to break off. The crab dip was tasty and savory enough that I could have a little and was still satisfied. Now the menu here is pretty overwhelming because you can pretty much choose anything in any food group to eat based on this menu. But, I ended up going for the fish tacos. I don't quite know what kind of fish was in the tacos but they were filling and satisfying. I didn't try the ribs but caught a glimpse of them and if they tasted anything like they looked, then those are some delicious ribs!   So to end my tale about my introduction to the Village Tavern, this is a great neighborhood restaurant that I'd happily visit again.",

We received 100 pts. for booking on Open Table and we did that on a Sunday night 45 min before we got there. Lucky we did because the wait was 45-50 minutes. Not really worth it for a chain restaurant.  Overall I'm glad we tried it. It just won't be at the top of my list to go back to anytime soon. It's a great place for Scottsdale tourists.",

This past Monday we stopped in again and as usual our meal exceeded our expectations. In addition our server was very helpful with describing some of the menu items for our guest who was a first time guest there. She not only knew how each item was prepared bur also knew details of the special ingredients and how carefully they are selected by the management for high quality to ensure a great dining experience.",

The tavern is a very nice place, more of a lodge feel instead of a the tavern I was visualizing.  Prices were a tad high but its in Scottsdale and one expects to pay more.  Food was not that great just ordered appetizers and like I mentioned earlier were cold and tasteless.  The clam chowder was great.  I should have gotten the Brunch that day which looked yummy on the table next to us.  I will not be back I'm afraid, TOO many restaurants to choose from to give another shot.",

It's the kind of restaurant that's not your first choice, but when all your other options are closed, or too far, or too crowded, you come to Village Tavern and you end up not being disappointed.  I was there today and had the $3 mimosas with the crab-cakes benedict. The potatoes that accompany the eggs are way too mealy, but the eggs themselves and the sauce are spot-on. Wished the crab-cake had a bit more flavor.  Bread service is by request only, which I really like.  Our hostess and our server were polite and efficient.   Overall, a good place to bring mom and dad to on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",

It was Happy Hour and they offered 1/2 priced drinks in the bar only. We chose a booth in the dinning room. The ambiance was warm and enviting and made you feel at home.  Our server (Colby) was very knowlageable on the food items but not as much on the adult beverages. We jokingly told him he should try each one on a day off or after work and he thought that was a great idea. Colby told us that this is a scratch kitchen so feel free to order what you wanted for sides regardless of what the menue satted.  None of us were unsatisfied with our meals or the expeiance, we all came away feeling like we had just found our new goto reasturant in the greater Pheoinx area.

Following that tradition, we recently planned a dinner to celebrate a birthday.  As normal for high season, the place was packed with people waiting for tables.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  That was a highlight of the evening.  Upon being seated, we immediately noticed a big change in the lighting with brightly shining spotlights over most of the tables with large chandeliers in several places in the dining room.  In the past, it has always been somewhat dim with small lights over the tables, giving a nice intimate atmosphere.  Now it's feeling like a big cafeteria.  I asked our server about the change and he said they had recently remodeled, including the lighting.  Strike one.  Timing of service was off as well.  While we're just 2 bites into our salad, a server appears with our entrees, ready to dump and run, seemingly surprised that we weren't willing to be rushed into accepting the plates.  We sent her and the entrees away.  Eventually we finished salads and the entrees reappeared, fresh from the warmer.  The entrees were generally good as we've come to know but the veggies did not fare well due to the wait.  Strike two.  I'm hoping the management will remedy the new improved lighting.  While seemingly trivial, it's amazing what a difference it makes in the overall ambiance.  The service issue can be passed off as a minor glitch although if it had been my first visit, it might well have been my last.  Please Village Tavern, please don't make a Strike three.",

Our server was over the top personable and helpful.  She was so genuine and friendly and really one of the top ten best in my experience.    BBQ ribs, tender fall off the bone and tasty without being cloying. The bruschetta was a hit with the whole table and the portion was huge, one order could be easily shared by two.  Pork chop was cooked to perfection and lightly seasoned paired with the mashed potatoes, just like mom makes, maybe a little better!  Overall, we visit Village Tavern every couple months and are always impressed, how do they do it!",

Everyone in here has got to be at least three-hundred years old.  Some are in the advanced stages of petrification - fossilizing before your very eyes!  I don't care. I like old people. If there's one think I know about old people, it's this; they didn't get to be old eating at Jack in the Box. No sir. Most have enjoyed a fairly healthy diet which is just what The Village serves up.  Try the brick chicken.  A half chicken deboned and cooked under the weight of a brick so it's crispy, flat and more important, tastefully delicious to an extreme. It's so tasty and delicious, you won't even chew it, you'll take the first few bites then eat it like you're a starving varmint; gulping it down insanely fast. I did anyway.  It came with a side of perfectly cooked fresh green beans and a solid pile of buttery good mashed potatoes. The dish was so extraordinary, it was all I could think about this morning as I sipped my coffee, which is normally the time I spend reflecting on how I'm going to traverse four Phoenix freeways on my morning commute without getting shot, killed or maimed.",

I specifically asked for the bread to be well toasted and crispy because my mom said during her last two visits it was soggy. Despite my request, the bottom piece of bread was mushy and wet. I ended up having to ask for a new piece of toast and had to reassemble it myself. The bacon was not nearly as good as it used to be. Service overall was spotty. It took a long time to get our drinks, and even longer for my fresh piece of toast. Disappointing.",

More people began walking in and she became busier. After about 5-6 minutes I began thinking she forgot me. I walked up and asked when we would be seated. She asked how many? I said still 3. Don't you remember me? She said do you have a reservation? I explained that she just told me it will be 1 minute. She had no recollection of me at all. Then she says we are only taking reservations tonight. I asked well why did you tell me I'd be seated in just 1 minute? She said she must have been confused. I'll say she was. How many? Three. One minute. Hardly complex discourse. I walked out pissed off as hell and hungry. Never ever experienced that before.",

    "text": "I was taking a friend out for his birthday and of course left it up to him to choose and he chose Village Tavern. This place was so great it felt like my birthday!  The restaurant may be a chain, but it certainly doesn't carry itself that way. I was completely surprised about that fact. I even told a friend of mine that the decor was reminiscent of Capital Grill in DC. The lighting was soft and inviting and the decor was really warm and rich. I felt so comfortable there.   Lisa was our waitress. I can only explain Lisa by saying that she surely must have been a server at the finest restaurants. I have NEVER had the kind of service she gave outside of Nobu/The London (Gordon Ramsay NYC), etc. It's the kind of service that is unobtrusive yet so attentive. As soon as we needed something it was as though we waved a magic wand and Lisa appeared. She was phenomenal. I highly recommend you ask for her to elevate your already incredible dining experience.   At her suggestion we started with the caprese and it was perfect. I love a really fresh, salty mozzarella and this was as though they made it on premises. It was a really nice starter and good for two people.  We then moved on to my very, very favorite thing almost ever. Mmmm! The southern shrimp and grits. Being from Texas you get a grit (ha ha) that is generally made in whatever way they boil it. There's generally no finessing it like VT does it. These were the creamiest, most flavorful grits I've ever tasted in my life, bar none. The shrimp. Oh wow. You can really mess up shrimp if you're not careful. It doesn't take much to push them over the edge to dried out which is no good for anyone. No problem here. They were large and tender and quite possibly I will want this dish to be the last thing I ever taste.   My friend got the prime rib and I'm positive he enjoyed it. My favorite part of his meal (he he)? The baked potato. I know that sounds silly, but have you ever had a potato with the outside coated in chunky salt? I have never (considering I've eaten at many a great restaurant). This was a revelation and I ate the whole thing. Sorry, I had to. It's a compulsion when I taste something that good I rarely care whose plate it's on. Delicious.   I say stop here, ask for Lisa, bypass the nachos and burgers and head straight to the gourmet. It's one of the best meals I've ever had.",

    "text": "I have visited this restaurant several times when visiting Scottsdale, predominantly due to its proximity to the hotel I stay at.  First and foremost -- the wait-staff and bartenders are some of the friendliest and attentive I've seen.  They take no blame here.  Probably the best fare here is the burgers -- they are hard to mess up, and you can always add more condiments.  This week I was there twice -- first with a group where we had appetizers and dinner.  I had some form of a spring-roll, a Caesar salad, and a salmon entree the first night, and another Caesar and a sandwich made from short-ribs.  I realized that it is highly probable that the kitchen must consist of a row of deep-fat fryers and microwaves since most of the fare is either fried or re-heated.  Having eaten the fare here, and noted others' plates, it seems that they must be purchasing pre-cooked items from Costco or an equivalent warehouse store and just reheating.  Certainly the appetizers are frozen-fare -- that seemed obvious (and not unusual for this type of venue.  But clearly the perfectly rectangular pieces of fish soaked in tangy sauce is also from the deep-freeze, as is the meat which purpotedly is a short-rib (it appeared more like my great-grandmothers pot-roast, except for the gooey, somewhat coagulated, fat).  Now, I actually kind of like that kind of food -- but not so much when the frozen salmon filet, easily purchased at about $3/filet, was served for nearly $24, and a sandwich made of short-ribs contained more bread, filler, and grease than meat (again, with a deference to frozen concoction) for $12.95 -- and the \"caesar\" salad for $6.95 which was just a regular old chopped iceberg lettuce salad with a squirt of cheap pseudo-caesar dressing, no croutons, no cheese, no bread, no nothin'  The problem here is value -- it's just far to highly priced for the quality of the product which is served.  On a side note -- they apparently have live entertainment on certain nights -- from what I experienced, I would suggest a better vetting process -- old-guy with guitar who fries the PA system first, then has no volume at all later, doesn't help.  Amateur night is best left for other venues which cater to cheap karaoke.",

    "text": "I stopped in with a couple of friends for happy hour at Village Tavern last night.  Located in the struggling Gainey Village Shopping center at Doubletree and Scottsdale Rd. Poor little high end dining and shopping center struggling along.  VT has always held it's own as a go to place for happy hour and dinner. The mini bar plates cover a range of food. We had Fillet Mignon  sliders (2 to a plate), pulled pork nachos, and Thai shrimp (4 per plate). Overall, everything was a little too oily. Oily tastes good for a minute. The flavors were good but the oil kept me from eating the whole plate. I think these items could be made a bit lighter and still be great.  I have had the cold sampler here before and it was very good. Sometimes we just can't resist the bad stuff.  Nice pour on the Grey Goose! I think Grey Goose should have a special of it's own since there was so much gray hair! A great place to take your parents for dinner. Seriously!  I am at the cross-over age group.  Lori was our server and she was terrific! The service in general was very friendly and attentive.   VT is pretty full by 6 every night. A True neighborhood bar with a friendly staff and a regular crowd. Always fun to get there early and mess up the \"regulars\" seats.  They had some smooth jazz on Tuesday which was nice. Performed by a local girl An Alum from Cocopah Middle School near by. Great style and sound.   VT is worth a stop! A very nice place to relax after work.",

The interior was dark and homey like some kind of hunting lodge with large booths and a Fireplace separating the two side of the restaurant and bar.   The menu had a lot of items to choose from. I decided on the Blackened Salmon Sandwich per the waiters recommendation and the fact that he told me that they fly in fresh seafood daily. (see pics)   My Sandwich was nothing less than Amazing! Really that was the most Delicious Salmon I think I have ever tasted, it was so fresh and juicy and perfectly grilled, WOW!  Not to mention the Sesame encrusted bun from heaven that it lay upon and the most beautifully fresh sliced tomato I have EVER seen on a sandwich ANYWHERE!  I chose pasta salad as my side instead of fries, this pasta salad was really fresh and tasty with sliced carrots, olives and peppers, dressed in a basil vinaigrette.   My daughter chose the Cheeseburger, as usual.(see pics) Even though I don't eat red meat I could see how juicy and flavorful her burger was. It was cooked to a perfect medium and came served on the same heavenly bun that I had, she was oohing and aahing over every bite.   Lucky for me I had a gift card to the VT or I may have never even bothered to try it.   I will be back for sure and if they keep up with this experience they may just get another star!",

I wanted to try some place different, so decided to give it a go.  Since I was by myself, I immediately went to the bar for liquid refreshment. Not a great selection of beer, but they did have several choices, so all was not lost.  I did decide to try something to eat, but since I wasn't overly hungry, I opted for a pizza. I was surprised - it was quite good for a \"bar\" pizza, and something I would order again. On a subsequent visit I had the fish tacos, which were also quite good.  I'm not a meat and potatoes person, but there were a number of choices on the menu that I am waiting to try.  However, it always seems that when I stop by, I'm more in a snacking mood than looking for a full dinner. But their menu is solid, and I will try a full meal when the mood hits.  A nice place, and I wouldn't hesitate to bring out of town visitors here.",

    "text": "Let me preface this with We Love Village Tavern!   We've been going there nearly monthly for over 4 years. This last time, our service was just terrible! If this had been our 1st visit we'd never go back. It was interesting to note that all the tables around us that ordered alcohol received stellar service. MMMMMM It started with ordering drinks, sorry only Arnold Palmer's for the table. Then appetizer, which was great. We had the Colorado Chips. Homemade potato chips with bacon, cheese and BBQ sauce. How bad can that be??? Then we ordered our entrees. But NO ONE ever removed the dirty dishes from or appetizers. MMM... So we flagged down someone to fill our water glasses, all the while staring at dirty dishes on our table. Finally we did find our server to refill our drinks, thinking he'd take the plates with him, but NO, there they sat. Finally when our entrees were served we asked that the dirty plates be removed. Got a roll of they eyes, almost like saying, \"that's not my job\". But she took the plates non the less. Not 1 single time during our dinner did our server or anyone else ask how our meal was or how we were doing. We did everything but fill our own water glasses. BUT, the tables on both sides and across from us were attended to like royalty! My partner even ran into the manage in the men's room, and discussed our 'lack' of service. Did he stop by the table after that??? NO, or at least not until we'd paid the tab. He then stopped by and gave us 2 cards. 1 for a free appetizer and 1 for a free dessert on our next visit. So, let me get this right....you are asking me to come spend more money with you in order for you to make up for the terrible service I received this time? Well as I started this tirade with, if this was the 1st visit with Village Tavern, I'd NEVER go back.  But, I've been going there for years and years and years. Even before moving to AZ we'd dined with them. Starting back in 2003 when we were on a vacation here from Chicago.  Will I go back? Yes with trepidation, but I will go back.",

You can get anything from sandwiches (Blackened Salmon Sandwich is great) to a nice big salad (Greek Salad + Chicken...very nice) to a nice piece of fish (Grouper Hemingway = amazing dish) or a steak (Prime Rib is where it's at). The prices are fair and you can go in and have a really good meal for anywhere between $20-$100 for two. Their bar is a really nice set-up with some flat screens and their happy hour is like half off booze and they have a nice little bar menu with some little snacks like these Prime Rib Sliders that kick some serious butt. The service is friendly and the staff is really good about helping everyone out even if they aren't our server. All in all they do things pretty well at the Village Tavern and for what they are trying to offer, they hit the nail right on the head.",

My best comparison would be if a friend let me borrow a Bentley convertible and cruise it around for a night, but I guess scaled down a little.  And they manage to combine feeling high end with being extremely kid-friendly.  I've never had anything less than excellent service, and the prices are very reasonable for great food, particularly if you catch happy hour.  Strongly recommended for everything from a family night out to a business lunch.  Btw, if anyone has a Bentley convertible they need cruised around a little just let me know",

    "text": "Nice place. More upscale than a \"pub\" ...menu wise that is. I had a newer item..chicken tacos. each one had a alrge deep fried/crusty chicken finger in it ( I was expecting more shredded chicken)  They were pretty tasty and had a nice spice. Harder to each with one large chunk of chicken though. The table we were at was a little warn and slightly sticky. They could use to take a step up on cleanliness. take everything off the table when you clean it so its done right.",

    "text": "My friend and I were hellbent on going to restaurant A. It's closed. After standing in their parking lot for 10 min we decided on the Village Tavern. She was more familiar with the place than I was. We walked in, sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by a friendly bartender. The woman sitting next to us, however, kept demanding his attention. Every time we started to ask a question or even order our first drink all we heard was \"Blah Blah Blah\" and our bartender was gone. A little frustrating. She quickly left and he was all ours! Our martini's were large and made perfectly. We order a couple appetizers (chilled sampler and the crab cake sliders, minus the bun). The chilled sampler was surprising. For the price there was quite a bit on there, and really good. The smoked salmon was definitely smoked! The sauces that came with the dish complimented the items perfectly, and I'm not a sauce person. The crab cakes were good, not incredible. They were served with a plain tartar sauce.   Next we order the chicken tacos off the regular app menu. Holy CRAP! These were the best chicken tacos I've ever had! What a perfect blend of seasoned (to perfection) chicken, guac, and lime crema with a tasty salsa. WOW! Three tacos come on the plate - it's more than a meal.   I was surprised at the reasonable prices, especially for the amount of food and the quality. Although our trip started out really crappy, it ended on a good note and we will be back.",

Try the bacon cheddar burger and you won't be disappointed.  No overcooked, dried out burgers here.  I order mine medium rare and it's always cooked to perfection.",

    "text": "My husband and I went here after our favorite happy hour spot had a 45 minute wait. The environment was nice, clean and there were tables at the bar open. They did not have the drink that I asked for but offered another one, which was actually good. The food was good but my main issue was that my credit card was charged for my meal and my neighbors table placing a significant amount of money on hold in my bank account after I let the waitress know of her giant mistake, which as it was my first night ever trying this place did not impress me.",

    "text": "I have always found the food here to be decent, but nothing too exciting.  They have a large menu containing items, from soups and salads to steak and pizza.  I have had many of the items and usually like what I have, but it is never anything crave worthy.  The best two things on the menu in my opinion are the meatloaf (weird I know, but it is good) and the Steak Au Poivre.  This is not a place that I usually would choose to go to, but if I end up there, the meal is always decent.  The service is spotty depending on who your server is, sometimes we great bread, sometimes we don't, those sorts of things.  But if you are looking for a menu that would appeal to a wide variety of tastes, this would work.",

Orderd the shrimp scampi for myself they should have described it as a plate of not tasty pasta with a few shrimp.  Complained to the manager and all he could say was well let me take it away for you.  Did not offer to take it off the bill.  Other party had fish and chips and told me it was just so/so.  This was not the first time that I had been there for an office event and but for sure it is the last time.  Would go somewhere else where the services is better and the food at least has some taste.",
