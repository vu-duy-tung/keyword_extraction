    "text": "I love this place for these reasons:  * Best west-facing patio in old town. It's upstairs on rooftop and during the winter months, it's a phenomenal spot to lizard-out while eating & drinking. * The food is good. Love to share the lavoshes, and Franco makes one hell of a bloody mary * They have the best potato-skins in the cosmos! Seriously. I know you're thinking \"who gives a rip about potato skins?\". Just try them and tell me I'm wrong. Won't happen.  * The upstairs patio & bar is a great place to just hang out whether you're eating, drinking or both. They have nice TVs for the games and a kick-ass old juke box. They also recently enclosed the bar area with glass, so it's more comfy during the warmer months.  * Downstairs, in back of the restaurant, there's a cutty bar that's nice and dark...and cool. They have karaoke all the time and apparently it does down in there. I don't karaoke, but occasionally when I hit the head, I'll do a hot lap back there to check out the folks' pipes. Decent.  *The location is incredible. Walking distance to anything you'd want in old town.   The only drawbacks to this place are:  * That west facing roof-top patio can be brutal in the summer. We'll see how much the enclosed glass helps. I've been recently to the upstairs bar after the sun is down, and that was reasonably cool.  * During the winter, you will see loads of tourists, fanny packs, white socks & Burkenstocks, freshly-purchased turquoise jewelry, picture taking with what appears to be safari outfits, etc. Small price to pay I suppose.   Weekend brunches in the winter is where you might find me there.  Cheers!",

After another 45 min had passed and we had watched the same people sing multiple times he went to go check the list again and was still the same spot in line, 10 spots back. When we complained to the waitress (since no manager was working) we were told that those singing multiple times had tipped $20-$30 and the KJ was catering to them. Total bullshit. We attend karaoke at local bars frequently and have never ran into a corrupt system like that. Needless to say, we will not be returning to the Grapevine.",

    "text": "I was out of town on a Wednesday night and heard through the grapevine (sorry, i had to) that The Grapevine was a great place for Karaoke. It was, IMO, OK.   The Bads: The songs are rather old. Not a problem because I'm a Karaoke geek and have a flash drive with new stuff on it. They can't use a flash drive. You have to bring a CD!?!? Who carries those? The singers were a balanced mix of singers, non-singers, and drunks trying to mumble something on the mic. If you want to pop out a song or two and you don't know someone there, you may get passed up in the rotation, on occasion. The sound system was outdated and scratchy.   The Good: You can sing starting at 5. Thats good if you want to hit it right after work. The server, Sarah (I believe), was cool. She brought us plenty of drinks. That's probably  because our party of 4 was hitting the Fireball and Crown like they were the last 2 bottles on earth. The pours were heavy, too, which is great for us, but probably hurts their bottom line. The pour may take me back of I'm in the area, so it could be good in the long run.    All in all, I would give them a 3.5 if I could, but would label it a dive bar you can get drunk at and sing a song as an afterthought,  not the other way around.   See my review on Ernie's, as well. It's about 15 minutes away from the Grapevine,  and worth the drive because of the awesome food,  excellent selection of songs and sound system, and real singers.",

They have another cute bar upstairs that's covered but open-air and allows for smoking and conversation. They also have a huge upstairs patio for dining which tends to be very popular during the winter months. Grapevine is a fun place to hang out - not a culinary adventure. While the food is decent it certainly wont impress Yelpers. However, the atmosphere in general, the staff, and the late night Karaoke are perfect.",

Now we are talking grilled cheese, chix tenders, club sand, quesidilla, 3 other cold sandwich and a couple burgers. All the food came out cold. The grease from the quesidilla was so bad thst the tortilla coouldnt even hold the filling. Grilled cheese that wasnt melted. Soggy bread on all the sandwiches.  Under cooked chix wings. This place was so bad we asked to speack with the manager who kindly comped the entire meal gave us excuse after excuse why the service was bad and food not cooked well.

Looking on the Yelp app for nearby bars or places to find such an activity, The Grapevine was at the top of our list.  Sure, it's not a well lit, clean or fancy bar in any way. And service is a bit slow, yet friendly. But the atmosphere, the clientele and the karaoke host  were absolutely bad ass. The crowd was a mix of people above 50 and people around 25-30. So every other song was unfamiliar to half of the bar and every other song was either terrible (in a good way) or totally awesome.   I had an absolute blast. While dive bars and karaoke are not typically my style, if I find myself back in Scottsdale for another work function, I certainly won't turn down a chance to come back to The Grapevine. A-OK in my book!",

The inside seating is dark, dingy and out-of-date, but their upstairs open air patio is very cool with fired gas lantern lights and rooftop seating that overlooks Old Town Scottsdale - a beautiful patio to watch the sunset from.  The service the past few times we have gone is poor. It was dead and staff could see us yet we were completely ignored on the patio for literally 15 minutes before I had to go ask the bartender to send a server over.   The beer is cold, they have a decent selection of beverages at the bar. The food is average - highlights include Rays double-fried wings (super crispy but under-seasoned and lacking flavor), and their lahvosh - of which they have close to a dozen options. The menu is absolutely huge which is perhaps why their food is just ok.   The low review here is given because of their service issues, indoor dining atmosphere being drab, and the average food. Definitely recommend the upstairs patio though for drinks at sunset and in the evening! Cheers.",

We sent it back and told them to just keep it since she had lost her appetite. Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but then it was a really, really bad day. Proceed with caution.  2 Stars for ambiance. I liked the deco.",

    "text": "Old town... karaoke... cold drinks... I mean I really don't think there are many establishments that can offer these three things every single night of the week.  For that reason, despite the drastic need for updating / polishing of ambiance / decor, they deserve four stars.    You know that scene in Swingers when they go to The Dresdin?  And the old couple is singing 'Stayin' Alive' on purpose?  Yeah - it was a lot like that - except the older folks singing weren't paid to do so and the crowd was a healthy mix of 21-90.  We showed up around 7'ish on a Sunday night smack dab in the middle of the older clientele rocking out.  Now, I had never seen a collection (like 30) older people care less about what anyone thinks regarding their singing voice.  This was kind of a treat in the people watching arena.  I heard songs I have never heard, nor want to hear again... I saw legit bell bottoms and junk grabbing like I haven't seen in years... They were flirting and dancing and drinking - and then about an hour later I saw the coffees start arriving at their tables as the songs / karaoke shifted to the younger folk.  Most of them shuffled out at that point, but some stayed to witness songs THEY'VE never heard and thus I got to witness a karaoke dichotomy that I'd never seen before.  The service was good, the prices were higher than average, ('cause Old Town)... but the evening was a success and based on living less than a mile away, I'm sure we'll be back many times going forward.  Great job Grapevine!",

Clearly, there were other intentions for this place when it opened years ago, but whatever works, right?  We stopped in for a couple of drinks and to listen to some karaoke. We didn't eat anything and I'm not sure that I would order food here.  As others have mentioned, the place is a bit run down and the restroom was pretty gross..not a very appetizing scenario.  Drinks were good though and the bartender was quick and friendly.  So if you know what to expect, this isn't a bad place to stop in if you're into this type of scene and want to grab some drinks while llistening or participating in karaoke.",

I never send food or drinks back but for this reason I was forced to. I let the waitress know about the fly and asked for a bottle and or can of any domestic beer. She said \"Coors Lite alright?\" I responded \"That'll be good, thank you!\" And then she walked away... There was no apology for the bug in the drink, no look of embarrassment, nothing. So, 30 minutes later out walks the waitress holding a GLASS of Coors Lite... Not a bottle or can like I'd asked. (If they didn't have any bottled or canned beer I assumed she would have mentioned when I first requested but I didn't want to cause a scene so I politely accepted the glass of Coors)  I didn't order food for fear of uncleanliness.  The night went on, the birthday girl put in her name for karaoke, we laughed and enjoyed ourselves until almost 2 hours later her name was called. No one else was able to sing karaoke due to the long wait time.    The waitress was rude, other employees walked around with mean mugs and gossiped amongst themselves about customers within ear shot!  The place was absolutely filthy and decor is outdated.  Other friends in the group were severely disappointed with their food and mixed drinks and all agreed we would absolutely never return.",

We enjoyed the atmosphere of the quaint inside bar and the refreshing breeze from the outdoor patio. You won't be disappointed in their menu. They have an all around menu - something for everybody. We chose to share the The Everything Lavosh. Crispy crust and tasty toppings. I am sure we will come back and have a blast again!",

An example.....I used the restroom, an employee was in there as well. There was water all over the counter and paper towels covering the floor and the trash was was piled high. She washed her hands, put on lipstick and walked out. She clearly showed no concern. Really? Wow!  The gal that waited on our table was not very friendly, seemed uninterested, especially when we didn't order alcohol and never once asked how our food was nor thanked us for coming in. My boyfriend hardly ate anything of what he ordered and she pulled the plate never asking how it was or if there was a problem.The food he ordered was unimpressive, cold (should have been warm) and not very good. I ordered the hummus, two flavors, and it was good. Not great especially for homemade, but not bad. We would have said something to the manager, but it seemed hardly worth it. A Yelp review will hopefully catch some attention. It's a really cool setting and I love the patio option upstairs.  Great view.  Too bad it was a bad experience. I was here several years ago and it was much better.",

Whether you're sitting on the upstairs patio near the bar or downstairs in the open-air restaurant (don't worry - there's still plenty of shade), it's relaxing and more importantly, delicious! I recommend the Lahvosh, which is a type of pizza made on Armenian cracker bread! Yum! I will say if you don't like birds, you may not enjoy sitting there. The birds aren't really afraid of humans anymore and tend to hop around the vine design at the side of the lower section or on the ledge of the upstairs patio. They will also come inside the lower section and hop around on empty tables, etc. The upstairs patio also has a wonderful view of Camelback Mountain!",

The ambiance is cute but casual, they have extensive patio dining, and a second bar area upstairs (covered) with more patio tables available.  The food is pretty good, and portion sizes are generous.  My favorite is the French Dip sandwich....it's simple, and tastes delicious.  What I am not as much a fan of is the Karaoke scene at night.  I actually LOVE karaoke, and the first time I went here I was excited to get up in front of an energetic audience and blast my way through some 80's pop song or another.  But apparently there are politics involved at The Grapevine when you want to sing.  The karaoke mistress runs the show with an iron fist, and only allows those that pay a small mortgage the opportunity to show their stuff.  Even if some drunkard has commandiered the mic for the last three songs, if he's paid the piper he will continue to blow out your eardrums....regardless of how many other people are waiting for their chance.  Definitely not how most karaoke places are run, and I wasn't a fan of it.  I've been back a few times since, and have experienced the same thing with the same karoake lady, so I know it wasn't just a fluke.  Too bad, the place is nice, but for karaoke I'll probably head north to Ernies...",

The ambiance is either a great dark bar or you can eat upstairs outside and there are misters to keep you cool in the summer.  Gotta love being in the heart of OldTown!",

My husband was at the Double Tree down the street at a trade show so I figured I would try to enjoy my day. I ate by the bar and had a wonderful conversation with the restaurant's manager Rose. She had an outstanding personality and actually got me through this bittersweet day, as all my friends are back in RI and I was sort of having a lonely 30th. I had the roast beef sandwich with the au jous sauce, salad and fries. I also had a glass of riesling (my personal favorite). And as Rose and I were talking about the difficulties of relocation I mentioned it was my birthday- no not to get anything for free. But I was treated to another glass of wine on the house and a slice of cheesecake. She did tell me that she does not work on Saturdays- sorry to other Yelpers who had bad customer service- she did tell me about Karokee but my singing days are over. I would definitely go back for lunch again just because I was treated so well.",

If you are looking for below average cuisine, this is your place.   The food may be acceptable with a hefty buzz, but as a sober dinner, it was deplorable. To add salt to the wound, the ketchup bottle top placed on our table had black \"stuff\" encrusted inside of it.  This was realized after the meal was over, making my stomach turn.  The only reason I gave 2 stars rather than 1 is because the 2 story outdoor patio is nearly one of a kind in Old Town Scottsdale and the service was good.  My tip to the Grapevine; please get a new menu!",

If you are that bad then stay home and sing in your bathroom and do not subject others to these obnoxious sounds.  More of a cowboy saloon type of establishment.  Does not fit into the Scottsfale scene at all.  More of a type of place you would find in the Southwest valley. They need to change this place into a more upscale place so that people will want to go here.  GET RID OF THE KARAOKE!!!!!",

I went for lunch, and sat downstairs which was under the balcony, and shady, but kind of dark and claustrophobic.  The greeter was a teenage kid who basically grunted at me when I walked in, \"upstairs or down?\"  The table was not wiped, and had crusty dried food spots on it.  The server was surly, no smile, no thank you.  Kind of afraid of the menu that was kind of all over the map, so I got the burger with cheese and bacon.  My iced tea took 10 mins to come, and the burger another 15 mins.  It was plopped down in front of me with no words, and the server walked away, so I had to get up to ask for condiments.  The burger itself came with shredded lettuce and tomato already on it, so you couldn't really disassemble it, but I managed to scrape off the lettuce, which I didn't want.  Other than that, not a bad burger, thick and handmade, with a good toasted bun.  They had a radio station playing over speakers which was either poorly tuned or not local, as it was very staticky and annoying.  As good burgers aren't hard to find in Old Town, I won't be back.",

    "text": "A karaoke bar on a Saturday night?! Get outta here! This place rocked. A little too packed though. The best way to describe the floor plan for this place is it's like an hour glass. It gets congested in the middle (where the bar starts and the drink prices are kinda pricey) so if you're trying to get from the front to the back, where all the action is, be a little patient; good things come to those who wait. There's also a nice patio for those people looking to get some fresh air or take a break from all the action. The karaoke host doesn't quite stick to the order in which your song request is submitted (some people sang twice before I got my ONE chance). All in all, it was a fun spot and most of the people there were cool; not what I had expected based on previous experiences I've had in that area. THUMBS UP FOR THAT! Oh yah, I also got to meet some fellow Yelpers there too who, which was the cherry on top! I'll definitely be found there again messing up more songs for public entertainment. nAcHo: Coming soon to a karaoke bar near you!!!   ***Da Bafroom: 4 stars for the bafroom! WOO HOO!!! A delightful aroma streamed throughout this miniature suite adding to the already pleasant experience I was having. The interior design/decoration was up-to-date with tiled walls, 2 fancy new urinals and one bathroom stall for those looking to participate in \"floor mounted porcelain activities\". Bathroom soap was definitely Dial (TM) or an imitation Dial Liquid Soap which, for this place and it's location, I would have expected something more fancy and better smelling like Body Works soap or Bed Bath and Beyond stuff. OH, who am I now??? I'm nAcHo, the Yelp Bafroom Extraordinaire, that's who! Sorry, (compose yourself, compose yourself...) I guess I felt a little spoiled being in sucha nice restroom...",

Lacy decided that it was okay to insult my partner early on, but we stayed and finished the drinks. She and the other staff were busy playing on their cell phones, leading me to believe there wasn't any management on duty. When we left, we left Lacy a quarter for a tip, worthy of her poor customer service skills. When departing, she made another rude comment towards me, that is when I requested to see the manager. She went on to say she was the manager. Then when I requested a contact number to her boss, she threatened to call the police and have me removed. I promptly left, but YELP is where LACY will receive her public debut. I hope the real management reads this as well as the public. I initially thought the rancid smell of the place radiated from the bathroom. No, the stench originates with the crappy bartender named LACY. The only reason i didnt rate this place with zero stars is because there isn't that option available. People, you've been warned!",

They tend to not be very good.  But, I have to say the service was great.

    "text": "Things got weird here... in a an awesome way. Came here a few weeks back for their daily karaoke and it didn't disappoint. The bar itself has a few different areas to it - an outdoor space, indoor dining area, and a small area for drinks and karaoke (I'm sure you can order food here as well). We were lucky enough to snag a table in the karaoke zone before the place filled up and became standing room only. While there were a bunch of regulars there showing off their chops, there were also a healthy amount of amateurs ready to lead crowd sing alongs to forgotten pop tunes. A big plus to the packed crowd was that everyone was into it and applauding, singing along, and being a sport to the 'performers' rather than the singers (my air humping often needs to rescue my singing). Things got raucous fast and it was entirely too much fun to watch and participate. If you're looking for a no-frills, fun karaoke night out, this is your spot!   Bonus: Our waitress and the karaoke MC were super friendly",

This can be a problem though because the rotation gets so large you may never get to sing. I've sat for two hours without being called. We have learned the best way to get your song played is to tip the host $20. That usually will get you one song. It's become a little ridiculous.   I've eaten here probably twice and I can't remember anything about the food. So that means it wasn't bad or good enough to remember. Passable.   Service by the cocktail waitress with the short platinum hair was actually stellar last time we were there. Normally it's impossible to find someone that is interested in helping anyone. So props to the pixie cut woman, I apologize for not getting your name. Drinks are pretty dependable here, so the bartenders have been consistent. If it hadn't been for the improved service and actually getting to sing last time I would have done only two stars.",

    "text": "WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!! I really wanted to be positive. So I will start with the best parts and work down.  However, this place was a waste of money and time overall.  1. Hostess was super attentive, more-so than anyone else, even the waitress. Sat on patio upstairs and nobody said a word to us for over a half hour. Hostess finally checked on us and horrified to hear no one talked to us, sat us in another section with another waitress/server.  Tipped her $0 (my biggest mistake)  2. Our now server was attentive and mostly on her game and mostly friendly.  Tipped her $10 on card $10 cash  3. Drinks are decent priced and bartender seemed on his game. Tipped him $5 for 2 drinks  4. Food was above average to good. Not remarkable.  5. Karaoke host was the worst part. He has no idea how to work a sound system and plays harmonica louder than the singers. Very crude. But the volume was reasonable at the beginning. We signed up before dinner. The host and I worked out that it was approximately a 45 minute wait. We waited another hour past that and he still didn't get to me. When I talked to him, he shuffled through his slips to find my name buried another hour or more away. He said, \"I'm not sure how that happened! I'll get you right up.\" I said it was fine and we waited another half hour and finally walked out because the music got so loud and so distorted that it was absolutely painful to tolerate. No matter how good/bad singer was, there was no enjoyment to be had.  Tipped him $5 for what service? Not that I should get bumped up for tips. But at least keep me where I know I was.  About $100 to Grapevine later, I am home in bed and I enjoy a tuna sandwich on the dusty job site more than I enjoyed this place. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!! WE LOVED THE HOSTESS!!!",

Service was friendly and pretty attentive.  They serve \"Armenian Pizza\" here, which is similar to the thin crust at Oregano's. As expected, I tried the wings, they have multiple \"ways\" here. We ordered Ray's Double Fried, in which they fry them after the sauce. Cools the heat down a bit but also the flavor. Second order was regular Buffalo style hot wings.  Kind of tough and dry. Don't need to have them again.   The verdict? Good place for karaoke buffs and drinkers. I won't be back for the food. And remember, alcohol makes everyone a \"Karaoke Star\".",

I said I gave her $50, and she said....oh yea, that's right and gave me the rest of the change. 20 minutes later I ordered a drink for 2 of us, she gave the other person their bottle of beer, but nothing for me.... then took the money off the counter. I didn't notice right away because there were a few folks standing around shooting the breeze. I said to her, hey you didn't give me the drink I ordered, and and again she said, oh I am Sorry again.... and poured my drink, saying next one is on me.... Well we didn't have any more, and finished our drink, and got up to leave....she said, hey you.

I said the so called drink on me never happened, and she said I was just kidding! Strangest thing is I never had this so called \"drink on me\" that she now says she was only \"kidding\" about. If a bar maid has such a poor memory and kids about your money, why would they trust her in the cookie jar....or is it part of her game to rip you off? 3 incidents in half an hour is just way to coincidental! As it turned out, I paid her for the so called 3rd \"on her ' DRINK BECAUSE I didn't want to make a scene. $12 isn't enough to fight about.

I looked on several sites and they all stated that this place had a \"catfish sandwich to die for\". Hmm, we'll see about that. Since this was close to the place I was staying, I decided to give this pace a visit for lunch.  Thankfully, I stopped by during an early lunch hour and there wasn't too much of a crowd. Seated myself in the outdoor patio. I knew what to order so I gave that info to the waitress.   The sandwich did live up to its name. It wasn't too flaky; nice texture and I liked the ciabatta roll that came with it. The slaw and salad that came with it were pretty standard but I didn't expect too much.   Service was excellent, time to table was great. Didn't experience the full ambiance but nevertheless I was satisfied with my experience. Will come back the next time I fly out here!",

They tried to get creative and made pizza with lavash (a bread that Middle Easterners typically use to wrap vegetables/meat and/or eat with spread) but it was a fail. The cheese was too heavy and the toppings were cold on top which made for an unpleasant sensation. Also it was difficult to eat; the lavash just kept breaking apart.  Will not be returning.",

Despite it being a little chilly out, in the spring when it warms up, I would love the patio here. We came at like 7PM on a Tuesday night and it seemed like there were a few regulars at the bar. The bartender who was doing a bunch of other things & in & out of the bar area said she would be with us in a second but didn't come back for a while so we left. Also, the smell in the upstairs bar area was super weird, I asked my boyfriend if he thought so too. So for a first impression of the place & service kind of sucking I gave it 3 stars.. maybe I will come back sometime to update the review... TBD.",

The karaoke area was teeny tiny, and clearly us amateurs (besides Kelly S, of course) were cramping the style of some more serious singers. There were some folks you could tell are anxiously waiting for The Voice auditions to roll through Scottsdale.  I liked that they would still serve you outside of the main bar area, because what a pain for me to get up and walk the five steps to the bar. Seriously, it was a nice treat, and our girl took great care of us despite how rowdy we were. Also, the restrooms were pristine!",

They have fabulous food (I love the fish over the jalapeno hummus with the cheesy pita bread) but all of the food I have tried there has been great.  My favorite part is second story outdoor patio.  The lighting is nice in the evening and it is fun to watch the city be busy.  I also highly recommend the drink called the Persian if you like vodka and cucumbers.  I could sit and drink those all night - except then I would need a cab!  Most recently I took my family (a party of 10) there for dinner.  There was something on the menu for everyone's tastebuds - even the kids!  Everyone thanked me for bringing them there as they all loved it and told me that they would be coming back.  I have yet to check out the Karaoke (although it was packed each time we were there for dinner) but that's because we are not big karaoke people.  I really do love the food, the atmosphere, and the drinks.  The staff is super friendly too.  We will be back!",

I love the flatbread and order it often--you can't miss on it !! The salads are super fresh and yummy. I occasionally order a sandwich or a burger and haven't had a one I don't like yet.

Our waitress was rude and short with us. We wanted to order food and we hadn't seen her in quite awhile so someone went to the hostess stand and the girl snapped at her! So rude!  When we finally did get our pizzas they weren't even cut properly. We were literally just tearing chunks off because neither one was actually sliced.  Overall, I'd say if you're looking for a fun night out, sure this place works but don't order food and keep your expectations pretty low.",

The relatively small karaoke room is usually always busy while the rest of the place is basically empty.   A seasonal exception to the back room karaoke being the only busy spot is the second level patio bar. This area is intermittently open during the winter/spring tourist season.

Show up on a Wednesday and you'd think the place was closed, until you walk to the back bar and discover a big crowd of regulars and quite a few weirdos from out of town (that'd be us) rocking out with some karaoke. There's some serious talent in the room, but don't be intimidated if your voice is as bad as mine. It's not about the vocals, it's all about the performance.   I saw a girl with no talent at all...I mean, she should be ashamed of herself (Katie I'm talking to you)...but she brought the house down with her antics on the mic. I personally subscribe to the theory that it's better that people assume you suck at karaoke than if you open your mouth and remove all doubt, but good for you, Katie.

Disappointing really, on both beverages and food..",

But once you find your niche and the fat book of songs -- I mean its REAALLY extensive -- then you can kick it a bit and enjoy the reduced rates of Scottsdale's version of what I imaging the bar at Club Med to be like ... lots of Tommy Bahama and Ann Taylor A-line dresses with Hibiscus prints ... everyone in Finn Comfort sandals.    Anyway, between your enthusiastic head nods through Don From Sales' rock n roll air-flute to Jethro Tull's 'Aqualung' and The Ladies of Sun Valley Office Park Suite B14's interpretation of Tiny Dancer, you can sign yourself up.  Graham C has balls the size of watermelons and after a small amount of coaxing, was convinced by our small party to rock the mic to Arctic Monkey's 'I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor'.

It has always been too late in the night for that. Plus, there was only one thing on our minds when we go. KARA-fucking-OKE!!! Well, I mostly am inebriated and Z and Dally want to sing. The people that run the jams remind me of the house band at the Dresden in Swingers. There is always this older dude there that insists on playing the bongos along to every song. Even if it doesn't fit.   Inevitably we sing \"Don't Stop Believin'\", \"Piano Man\", and \"Sweet Caroline\". It will be a group of us guys and it is a good time had by all. One time I worked up the courage to sing a song with my buddy Z that didn't involve everyone at the bar. We did \"Black\" by Pearl Jam. I think it went well. It felt like it did anyway.   I always have a blast when I am here. Save the time my ex-wife and the girl I was seeing at the time came within about 5 feet of each other. It felt like my head was going to explode. I think Garth Algar said it best,\"Did you ever see that part in Scanners when that guys head exploded?\" No amount of alcohol could have made me drunk that night.     You will see a very eclectic mix of people in here, but don't be scared.",

In fact, the bartender served them with chili, and when me and Mr. Gold kindly explained we are vegetarians and do not eat chili, he scoffed and gave us the worst case of stink eye I have ever experienced. I'm sorry, if I am paying nine god damned dollars for some nachos, they better be right.  Granted it was a busy Saturday night, but the service was not good. It took forever to get a drink even though I was sitting at the bar. And again, that nasty douche bag of a waiter was such a prick. Ummm.. HELLO... I am buying shit from you and your freaking tip is going to depend on your attitude.   The one completely redeeming thing about The Grapevine is that the karaoke is pretty awesome. Pretty much everyone back in the pit sings along, so it really becomes like one big group voice ringing out in the night.  Let me give some of you a piece of advice, though... don't select songs that are downers that will make me want to slit my wrists. ESPECIALLY if you cannot sing. That is just NOT fair.",

Nice...I shall join them soon.  I enter and am all of a sudden in a small room, with two massive table things. Nothing but darkness and the sound of Elvis in the background. I was instantly confused. WTF is going on here?!?!  As I creep around the bar, I discover the backroom - packed with people of all sorts, an energetic DJ lady and various tunes blasting out of the karaoke machine that my grandmother most likely swayed her hips too. Shall I be scared or embrace it? I embrace it and feel oddly at home.  Since I don't have much of a singing voice, I opt for the other option: Liquor. I order the bloody mary, others order the margarita. Both were..meh. And pricy to be honest. The menu was huuuuge...talk about selection! The only thing missing from the menu, since it was all over the place, was Sushi. We order the chuck burger. Solid; as it should be for $7.50.  The BIGGEST negative, that left me with a horrible aura, was the bartender. No personality, rude, and just nothing I want to encounter again. This drug the star count down.

I'd say this place serves some decent grub but they can't make up their mind what kind of restaurant to be. The middle panel of the menu boasts middle eastern lavosh while the right panel advertises Italian and the left panel offers typical sandwiches with a quesadilla thrown in for a twist. It's definitely not a destination restaurant more the kind of place you need when it's scorching outside and you're dying of hunger and thirst...okay, it's not that bad, but why go unless you just happen to stumble into it on your way to someplace else and if that's the case, you wouldn't be reading this review.",

I think one of the best parts about the Grapevine is the diverse realm of fun you can have.  Whether it's some day-drinking up on the patio for Spring Training, some racious karaoke with a distinctly more...experienced...crowd, or grabbing some pizza in a dimly lit dining area, The Grapevine is definitely not a bad place to stop.  It's been a while since I've had the food here, but from what I remember it was pretty tastey and equally reasonable in terms of price.

They kept the martinis coming, but I can't tell you if they were good or not, because I was pretty drunk.  We ordered food too, but I was too excited to sing to eat any of it.  But it mostly disappeared, so it must of been okay.   I put 4 songs on my piece of paper, but was only called on once in the 4 hours we were there.  They said there was a rotation, but others got to sing more than a few times and everyone in my group only got to sing once.  I felt like they were giving the 'regulars' more songs.    Also, it was a Saturday night and the 'regulars' were all singing country songs and showtunes.  I was practicing all week, I wanted to SING!!!! And their slow songs were boring me.  So hopefully there are other options in the valley for Karaoke, it did feel pretty awesome singing and dancing on the stage, in a drunken stupor and I'd like to do it again sometime.   If I end up here again, perhaps I will change my review, but I'll never go here again on a Saturday night.",

    "text": "Dive bar at Scottsdale prices; be prepared to spend $6-$9 per drink, mostly ice.  My experience here was so disappointing. Walking in it feels like a cozy bar, and my friends and I were immediately drawn to the karaoke.  I arrived at 9:30 PM and put in my songs within a half hour. As I write this review it's 1:41 in the morning and I've yet to sing a single song.  I repeat: I've been here +4 hours without a single tune to sing. And most of the bar has already cleared out.  Apparently the DJ doesn't call people in chronological order, but rather based on what he's \"feeling\" at the moment. And apparently my song is too contentious and edgy and non-crowd pleasing to make the mix. I can understand though; apparently Will Smith is just too obscure for him.   This isn't an exaggeration: anything post-dating the early 90's will not be called.  I'm assuming this is because the DJ's an older gentleman that likes to sing along - he literally has a mic and will sing your song, sometimes over you - and doesn't know the more contemporary hits. Oftentimes he'll shy away to older stuff like \"Sweet Caroline\" and \"Piano Man,\" so if that's your taste then maybe you'll find the atmosphere more compatible. But if you're a fan of music as edgy as Bruno Mars (I know, suuuper edgy) then know this going in: no matter how long you wait, no matter how much you tip, this man will not play your song if he doesn't like it.  You will be better served to ask the DJ what he wants to hear next than request what you like to sing.  Also, watch your drinks. Not (just) because of potential drugging, but because the cocktail waitresses will actually snatch them away from you to clear your table, regardless of how full they are. Even if you're sitting right in front of them, available for them to ask, forcing you to buy another drink.  All in all a very disappointing karaoke venue and unfortunately falls far short of recommendation.  If you're looking for a good karaoke bar, I recommend looking elsewhere.",

It's tiny inside though so you may not get a table and even if you do you are in pretty close quarters. I've never eaten there but it's always packed upstairs on their patio during the weekends so my guess is that it's good. They have a good downstairs patio too. I prefer to go here once it's already dark outside, I just feel like it's that kinda place. It's pretty old school. Another fun perk is that a lot of wedding parties will come here (it seems like from out of town) and get wasted and fight and cause a bunch of chaos. That has been the case on NUMEROUS occasions and has always been entertaining. Probably not to the best man who got kicked out of the wedding the night before at the Grapevine, but it was for the rest of us. Also something kind of funny is that we went for a friend of mine's birthday one time and I signed her up for \"in da club\" by 50 cent ...obviously because it was her birthday. The staff like cut her off mid song because it was inappropriate or something. It was awkward, hilarious, and really friggen weird considering they had it in the book and I've heard people sing way worse there... Also I hope none of you have had to witness my terrible rendition of Fiona Apple.",

The waitress was beyond rude and unhelpful. For some reason she had a rather large chip on her shoulder especially after we didn't want to order alcoholic drinks...   Not that it matters a huge amount but the open sores she had on her face didn't offer an appetizing environment. The food was shall I say inedible to be kind. And the worst part of it all was we told the hostess about the server and the food...guess what she said! 'Yeah I know!' that waitress is mean but she's been here way too long to get rid of AND she has her good days and bad days guess this was a bad one!

Stopped it mid-song and asked me to pick another one.  But then Richard Z was allowed to sing \"I want your Sex\", which is waaayyy dirtier (and he did a fab job BTW), and he didn't get cut off. What's the deal? If you don't want songs with bad words to be sung, then take them out of your songbook. Don't make a big deal about it and make me seem like a jerk because the song writer likes to drop the f-bomb.  Don't bother with this place for Karaoke. 2 bad experiences makes this place low on my list and not worth the trip.",

The karaoke area is small and cramped, and the place just feels old.  When I went this past weekend, it was annoying because they don't run the karaoke in the order of submission.  We were there for 2 hours before anyone from our group was called, while other people walked in and were called 20 minutes later.  That's not cool.  Also, the music is soooooo loud on some songs that it's hard to hear the person singing.  And it is especially too loud when the KJ starts playing that damned harmonica during a song.  This is karaoke, not his time to shine.  The poor guy trying to sing over that loud-ass harmonica just stopped trying to sing altogether.  Someone needs to tell him to pipe down.  The harmonica adds a nice touch, but he doesn't have to be all up in the microphone with it.  Ridiculous.",

Franco has always been our server so the last time we were there I asked him how long he had been working there - 35 years was the response.  Kudos Franco.  We have tried many items on the menu.  The food is mediocre, but satisfying and flavorful.  The lavosh is incredible.  Stay away from the cajun chicken quesadilla (very messy and only cheez and chix) and the buffalo wings scared me a bit (not a fan of pulling apart pieces of chicken).  I would recommend the veggie lavosh or the cajun lavosh.  We have had the fruit plate (LOTS of fruit - great for a hot summer day), and various sandwiches.    The prices aren't too bad - the drinks are a little on the pricey side.  The other employees are generally friendly and helpful.  It's a great place for late night eats.",

Meat was tasty but not exactly plentiful (I'm used to a New York style Reuben - with loads of meat).  Potato salad that came with the sandwich was very good, a pleasant surprise.    Outdoor seating was nice, though the birds did get tiresome.  Place seemed clean.  Plenty of seats.  Upstairs deck area would be great in the evening.  Seems like it would be a much more fun place with a group of people for happy hour  or dinner than it was for lunch.    Bottom line - it was okay.  Not bad, not great.  I'd give it another try but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.",

That irritated me at first, but as the night went on I realized that it was kind of refeshing not to be in a rush.  We ordered a few bottles of wine, and got a lavosh, sauteed chicken strips, and chili. The chili had a weird after taste to it, but the lavosh and the chicken strips were great! The lavosh was made with Dolfino cheese and Cajun chicken, which proved to be a great combination. I loved that the chicken was not dried out either :)  After eating, my family and I joined in on some karaoke that was already going on...and we had a great time!

What makes matters worse is they charge a 20% gratuity for over six people (we had three adults and three children) and she wasn't worth that much. Once we were able to order, I ordered the Scottsdale Salad with salmon. I was pleased with this meal; it was flavorful, just the right amount of ingredients and the cut of salmon was thick and perfectly cooked.

Add in the mix of getting to know fellow Yelp Community Ambassadors from other cities and I'm TOTALLY DOWN - even Karaoke, which happens to be my nemesis.   Yeah. I'll admit. I'm not a fan of Karaoke. Don't get me wrong - I love watching other people sing. I personally don't enjoy doing it.   So when Scott C, an avid (and fantastic!) karaoker (is that a word?) asked if we were up for it, we went along. A local suggested The Grapevine and off we went on those motorized and overpriced golf-carts.   Walking in I noticed a foul stench coming from the ladies restroom and a line extending deep into the back. We had to squeeze our way to the back karaoke room and somehow, like a Yelp miracle, we found ourselves a table and chairs.   Boy did Scott C hit the nail on the head. I sucked down my beer anxiously awaiting the performance of Scott C. I knew it would be epic. I knew it would be legendary. I didn't know it would take freaking FOREVER. That Grand Master or whatever you call him was a total douche. There's absolutely no reason why someone should have to wait almost two hours to do Karaoke. That's just terrible!  At one point I went into the bathroom and walked into two boys mopping up a vile mess. They apologized and said they'd be done in a minute. When they were I opened a stall and found out they indeed were NOT. Vomit covered the stall door, bathroom seat, and just about every other square inch of the place. Yikes!  I suppose Grapevine has its \"type\" - lesson learned.",

    "text": "Had the urge late one Friday night to do karaoke.  A local recommended the Grapevine to us.  It's a small bar and was VERY loud.  I don't mind loud spots most of the time, but all the \"Dilly Dilly\" bros were pushing my limits.    Now it does have a fun atmosphere as everyone singing along and cheering the person that just sang.  I picked a song as soon as we got there.  It well over an hour and I was still waiting to sing my song.  I wasn't too concerned as it was a different person each time, but then shortly after there were people singing for the second and third time before I got to go up.    Sure, yeah people like to see the cute young girl and tight black dress, but give everyone a chance to have fun and sing...this is not American Idol.    Maybe I made the mistake of not tipping the DJ.  I don't feel that I should pay to sing.",

My husband had been here before and we parked as soon as he recognized the place. So glad he did!  The layout is nice because you have a rowdy bar area in the back, a laid back front resto area and a top outdoor patio/deck area. It was instantly obvious that we were from a colder climate! We chose the outdoor deck and felt fine after dark in February with just a light jacket.   We got two different kinds of Lavash, which is sort of like a thin cracker crust pizza. I don't think it was just the pregnancy cravings, it was delicious. We started with the Seafood Ceviche, which it most like a Seafood Salsa. Again, just so tasty!  The waitress was prompt, friendly and made a good local brew suggestion to my husband. Would stop back here again!",

We had a bunch of leftover alcohol we brought into the restaurant with us because we didn't have our cars to put it in. They had no problem letting us in to spend upwards of $600 in food alone for the 25 of us, but after we ate we went downstairs for karaoke. My friend was approached rudely and told she had to leave because she had boxed wine and Arizona alcohol law says I guess you can't have that (btw we aren't from here). Instead of being polite and offering to put it behind the bar like we found out she could have done the rude waitress told my friend she had to put it outside which she did. She was then told she was being kicked out of the bar. It's amazing how they had no problem when that corporate credit card was being presented by her but was so rude the next minute when she was just a black girl in a bar....by the way the food was not great either. Came out Luke warm at best. There are plenty of other places to go to in old town Scottsdale and I'd recommend any of them over this place. The only positive and single star goes to Grace! She was our spectacular dinner waitress before the incident with such a large group!",

Literally waited 15 minutes for the waitress to come back with just the beer (forgot the water)- we asked to order our food when she delivered the beer. She said No! When our water finally arrived it was slammed down on the table, as were our plates when she delivered the not very good food. Poor service, so so food, there's got to be something better.",

DJ would start playing songs before singers would get to the microphone. No stage area due to size. Some would stand in front of DJ and most would just sing where they were standing or sitting. This eliminated the 'performance' aspect of karaoke. They do not have a large selection of music either. I gave the DJ 3 songs for me to sing that almost anywhere else has and they struck out on all 3. Really???? When I got there I asked how long is the wait and the DJ said, \"20 minutes.\" Well an hour and fifteen minutes later he called me up. Ridiculous!! The sound and microphone quality was also poor. Bottom line I would never go here again!!!! And their website says, \"Arizona's Karaoke Place.\"  How depressing, poor representation of the state.",

Back then I hung out at the Grapevine literally 3xs a week for karaoke, but the last couple of years the place has really taken a nose-dive.  The last 2 times I was there, the karaoke host was extremely rude to me and other guests - the one I'm talking about is a middle -aged large female with over-bleached hair and terrible body odor.  She made fun of people's singing and insisted on singing 2 or 3 songs in a row herself while customers were waiting an hour to sing.  At one point she even came up and ripped the mic from my hand as I was ending a song, and I wasn't the only person she interrupted either.  As much as I used to adore karaoke at the Grapevine, after that I will never return.",

The sound system is baaad, excessively loud accented by an annoying screeching pitch.

I think the location is fantastic and the building itself is great!  I would do an overhaul on the menus (drink, wine and food) and concentrate on the quality of food being served and food presentation.  I'm sure this place isn't hurting but I know it has some real potential to be AMAZING.  As it stands, it's only ok at best.",

We were a party of four and two kids and between us we ordered 4 meals.  We got two meals delivered and then nothing, the server just left.  Then, we got another meal, again with no explanation about where the last meal was.  After a few minutes of waiting,  the server stormed by in a rush to tell us that the flatbread was made incorrectly and that's what we were waiting on.  Meanwhile, I started to nibble on my chicken taco salad. ...and it was awful.  It was like canned chili meat thrown on  some spinach and  lettuce with an unappetizing blob of sour cream.  Missing the black olives the menu promised me, I thought I would ask for them.  When I did, the server literally turned and walked away from me before the sentence was out of my mouth.  Finally the flatbread came out, but it wasn't the made the way it was ordered.  When this was pointed out, the server actually said, well I didn't  hear you say that and whirled around with the food with no further explanation.  When it did  come back, the mushrooms had just been scraped off, which was not okay.  When told this, the server said, well what do you want me to do about it?  When I tried to  speak to the manager, the server interrupted and said you can tell me.  When I started to explain why we were unhappy, she tried to make excuses about her other 3 tables she had to serve and finally cut me off saying I'll just get you another server and walked away.   I did explain the situation to the \"night manager\" and she comped the terrible food and gave us a piece of cake.  Plus we did get a new server, who did much better. Overall, not a great experience and we won't be back.",

The fries were just fries nothing special that i could tell, i've also tried the Mahi Mahi sandwich which was also good. If you find yourself here in the cooler months of the year you'll love the patio and find it hard to want to leave.

Our waitress came over very quickly and asked what we wanted to drink, we ordered 2 waters and a beer.... it took 20 damn minutes to get JUST our waters!!!!! 10 minutes after that the SINGLE beer my dad ordered came. Our waitress came back at about 10:15 (45 minutes after we sat down) to take our order. I ordered Chicken Strips and my dad ordered a Caesar salad... could not be an easier order, right???? WRONG! It was almost 11 o'clock before our food came! My fries were cold, my chicken strips were gross and frozen pieces of crap thrown in to a deep fryer and tossed on my plate. My dad's salad was just as disappointing.  I understand it was Saint Patrick's Day and the service might have been a little bit slower because of the crowd. But my waitress did not even wait on the people in the bar nor did they serve food in the bar so the sucky-ness and slowness had nothing to do with that! This place sucks A$$!",

Good to know when you are ordering, since we didn't and had about 1/2 the food left over after we ate.   I would only come back here to drink or be in the sun on the convenient patio area.",

I realize we weren't all arriving at the same time or leaving at the same time, but we were drinking cocktails in the middle of the day on a week day.  Wouldn't most waitresses see that as a great way to get a bigger tip?  Come by more often, bring more expensive alcoholic drinks, offer to take food orders every now and then to keep us there and drinking longer, and for GODS sake, pretend to be nice.  Seriously - she was awful.  It was clear that she couldn't have cared less that we were there.  And the food was sub par.  My turkey club was a wrap with some turkey, bacon, and lettuce in it.  The cheese was melted on top to make it look like it was a burrito, and there was some canned salsa on the side, for about $11.  No fries or chips or fruit....really?  Some of the reviews make it sound like the dive bar to go to at night....I love dive bars so maybe I'd try it again, but that's a big maybe.",

One time really drunk I looked over an saw Elvis enjoying himself here as well. Well bourbon in a short glass with coke, nice price, very reasonable so I'll stay for another, and maybe get a bite to eat.

Two floor seating, we went on a Saturday evening when the top floor was packed so we opted to sit downstairs. The waitress was friendly and I felt like we received good service. As an appetizer we had potato skins, which we received quickly and were tasty. I was hungry that night so I ordered two gyro plates. I enjoyed my meal but they were nothing special, just standard gyros. My girlfriend on the other hand did not  enjoy her meal. She had fettuccini with shrimp. The pasta was undercooked and the shrimp still had tails on them. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it definitely took away from the atmosphere by having to pull shrimp tails off before being able to eat.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience. I would not get a pasta dish or anything with shrimp there again, though.",

She kept apologizing for the delay, but really she was a part of the uproar. We ordered fish and chips. Pretty sure there's a \"Gorton's Fish Filet\" box in the kitchen. Rubbery and not freshly made.

The music hasn't been updated in probably 20 years, the song books are listed by song only (which is a pain in the ass) and you get to hear every horrible sad country song you can imagine, but I love it.  the drinks are cheap by old town scottsdale standards and karaoke starts at 5pm every day of the week, even earlier on weekends.

The only negative was I asked one of the servers to bring me water 4x through-out the evening and she did not.  I didn't catch her name but she was tall with brown hair and in her mid-forties, but she could sing pretty good with a deep voice. She came up a couple times to perform as it was a slow night.

She kept saying 'we do things differently here' and 'whatever' when trying to order.   So of course I didn't tip(but tipped the other bartender because I'm not an A hole). So when she gets wind of this she walks up to our table, poked me in the chest in front of my boss and coworkers and goes 'if you have something to say, don't be a pu*** and say it to my face'...  . WHAT?! This lady is like 60 years old TOTALLY didn't expect that. Safe to say we got out of there as fast as we could. I'm so perplexed on how any of this even happened.

Most of the time we shared off of each other's plates and split the appetizers. everything was made to order and brought out piping-hot including the breads which they had.

    "text": "Karaoke bar. Friday night, looking for some fun. My friends and I are karaoke nerds so we thought we'd check it out. Got there a little after 9 and it was beyond crowded. We shared a table with some awesome strangers and a waitress came by to take our drink orders pretty quickly. So that was good. We turned in our song slips within about 15 minutes of arriving and after being told MULTIPLE TIMES that our songs were only 5 songs away....we finally got to sing. After midnight. Over 3 hours of waiting. We tipped the DJ $10 bucks when we turned in our songs....and other people still sang multiples times before we even got once chance. So...unless you're just a spectator, or you're willing to drop all the dollars...don't expect to actually get your turn to sing.  I'll try again because I feel like this could be a super awesome karaoke spot, but since I am only in town for a couple days....I'm a bit disappointed :(",

    "text": "I hate to leave a bad review because we went there tonight because I love karaoke  and that part was fantastic. however, this place really needs new bartenders. I think she said her name was mia, it was loud and hard to hear, but she was awful from the minute we got there. I arrived with a group of 7 people who  all ordered drinks. She acted like we were a nuisance to her and gave us dirty looks the whole time. When we asked her for drinks she rolled her eyed and scowled. My fiance is super sweet and thought she was having a bad day so he tried to cheer her up by complimenting her and  trying to make her laugh but she shot him dirty looks. There was only one other group there and they were obviously wasted. They could barely sing anymore and just kept bouncing around  and goofing off, which is normal for a bar. Except that she treated us like outsiders that didn't belong there. My friends went to cheer and spilled a tiny bit of beer because the glass was full. They were nice enough to apologize and clean it up and Mia told them they have to leave cause they were breaking things. There were 7 of us and not one person saw anything broken.. Just a few drops of beer that they so graciously cleaned up themselves. Mia said she didn't wanna clean up after us so we had to leave. At this point I decided she didn't deserve the nice tip my friend left on the counter. I told her to take it back, and the other bartender, an overweight brunette who's name I don't know, heard me and snatched it up quickly before I could. I had to tell Mia directly that she  gave us the worst service ever and I cannot allow my friend to tip her. She reluctantly gave it back. It takes this much for me to not tip someone. I'm a huge tipper. I work for tips too so I understand how this works, but I would never treat clients like she treated us. I earn my tips. This was literally the worst service I have ever had.  Mia needs to find a new career because service  and friendliness are not her forte.",

It's unfortunate that the food and service were sub-standard.  I'm not sure if it was our group of 12 that made the service lacking, but it wasn't busy at all for a Wednesday night and the service was rather slow.  The food was lacking as well.  The hummus was okay - flavor wasn't as potent as typical hummus.  Prices are fair, but this place is probably one of the worse dining venues in Old Town Scottsdale.  The other one would be Italian Grotto.",

Provide the classic dive atmosphere with dim lighting, stiff drinks and KARAOKE, while charging Scottsdale pricing. By far one of the funnest Karaoke bars I've been to besides the Lamplighter in San Diego. It's funny to walk into a place like this in Old Town to find a mixed crowd of people ranging from 25 years of age to probably 60! I'd say the highlights of this place were the KJ, who had our group in stitches all night. He has us singing songs like \"I Like Big Butts and Short Dick Man,\"  and the bongos on the stage. I can't speak to the menu since we didn't eat there, but it looked like standard/average bar fare. I had a blast and I you will too!",

    "text": "Grapevine is one of the only karaoke bars within a many, many mile radius. Because of this, Grapevine gets an A-OK because this bar can offer a good time if you go in the right mindset. The right mindset is when you're ready to belt it out with the \"best of them\" aka, a combination of elderly people and really drunk young people.   I would really only ever go to the Grapevine for karaoke. I've eaten here a couple of times and the food is par. The venue itself is older, a little warn down and in need of some TLC. However, the clientele probably doesn't case because again, most people visit the Grapevine after several cocktails in order to live out their dreams of being on America Idol.   Be warned that the while the Grapevine itself is spacious with a decently sized second floor deck, the karaoke is inside and it can get very cramped. There are only a handful of tables inside and on a night and especially a weekend night, it will be very crowded and will most likely take a little bit of time to get a drink and sing. The old timers who are regulars here take their singing very seriously so don't even think about cutting in front of them! :)",

I've heard the best rendition of RESPECT I will ever hear in my lifetime at The Grapevine.  It was sung by a straight man using a feminine voice and it was so bad it was good.    My friends sang a Spanish duet that I begged them not to sing and two people actually sang along!?  I thought that shiz was gonna bomb, but I was wrong.    You will probably be the last to sing if you are not a regular.  That would be me and so I always get screwed.  I end up singing \"I Touch Myself\" to my friends and the only other person in the room who's name hasn't been called.    If you do get the chance to sing at a peak time, drunk strangers will probably dance behind you on stage, some may even try to come up and sing along with you.  Someone will most certainly play the bongo drums in the corner, and that someone will most definitely not pay attention to the beat.  Sounds fun, doesn't it?",

Came in from California for a reality check - had a group of 13 girls spending hundreds of dollars on a few rounds, requesting songs, and we were pushed aside to say the least.  While the waitress constantly hassled us to buy drinks if we were sitting, we put some of the girls down for songs and we had 1 person go up in the 2+ hours we were there.  While one could argue there was a large cue to accommodate, it was strange to see people come up and sing 2 or 3 songs in a row.. but our group couldn't get anyone else a song?  There couldn't have been more than 40 people in there, so mathematically it doesn't make sense.  While I don't wanna say it.. This place felt super racist.  They were all for taking our money, and wouldn't give us a chance to participate in \"the fun\".  We were visiting town for a bachelorette party and ended up at the wrong spot, I would absolutely avoid this place if I could do it again. I get that places have regulars and need to honor that, but paying customers should be respected in the same light.  We left disappointed and the bride (calmly) mentioned her concerns to our waitress, just to point out that this is an issue and not a way to run a business.  Our bachelorette was given a *dismissal* hand motion, which was a completely disgusting way to handle the situation.  Can't fully put our feelings and reaction into words- but this was a extreme disappointment/ perspective of this establishment.  I'm hurt and angry, and wish we  knew otherwise- hoping to pass on the knowledge here.",

Even after tipping Gimli (the \"Dj\" who chooses who sings next) he still would push off our songs and give priority to all the other white patrons.   We sang along with the American music we know, and cheered for the people we don't know. We were discriminated, and did not have the opportunity to sing our karaoke songs after 2+ hours of waiting. The same patrons (who seemed like locals and usuals at the bar) were given multiple opportunities to sing. Once we realized that they were pushing our opportunity to participate, we were approached by the owner who asked why we were leaving. We told him we felt discriminated, and he responded back by telling us \"well, most people tip the DJ\" even though we had tipped the DJ 15+ dollars. Out of the 3 people that tipped, only 1 person sang after 2 hours.   I have not felt or experienced this type of discrimination / racism at any of the other bars or restaurants in Scottsdale.

Later it got packed and there didn't appear to be a structured singer rotation, but if you seemed to be skipped, you could remind the KJ and he was cool. Only problem I had is that I was unaware that if paying with credit card/bank card they automatically hold $50 in addition to your bill, which will be credited back later, (in my case it was 5 days later) just sucks if you're not expecting it.  I would definitely come back next time I'm in Scottsdale. Karaoke was  fun, food was good, waitress and bartenders were attentive even when it was packed, I would just bring cash. There were kids here earlier, not sure when or if it's a strict 21 and over policy.",

I ordered a drink and sat down. I went up to talk to the karaoke host. He barely smiled and greeted me. I asked him if he had anything else that was not in his book. He asked me what I was looking for. I told him, and he says, \" oh yeah.. No. I don't have that one. Your not the only one that has asked about it though. I'm about 3 years behind right now.\"  I checked through the rest of the book, which was about 65% country, 30% OLD, and 5% newer. This place is toyed as a karaoke bar!!! 7 days a week and the selection is ancient! I asked the waitress for my check to pay for The drink. She brought me another drink! I corrected her and she brought me my $10 tab for a single drink on a WEDNESDAY!!  Overall atmosphere was not good. Probably will not be back.",

The only two things I would recommend is going early because they get packed and it's hard to find a spot to sit enjoy. And also, I think you have to really be drink towards the later part of the night to understand and enjoy some of the crazy drunks. We saw two men get kicked out because they lit their cigarettes INDOOR! And they were locals-- how do you do that? Lol",

    "text": "My only recommendations as far as Grapevine goes are the following. READ THESE VERY CAREFULLY!  1.) Eat before you come. DO NOT EAT HERE! The food is absolutely terrible. I ordered potato skins sans bacon and fried shrimp. The potato skins were absolutely slathered with a glob of processed tasting cheese and dripping with oil. The shrimp was wretched as well. When I bit into it, grease shot into my mouth and it's literally all I could taste. It. Is. BAD! The rest of my friends were disappointed with their food as well- one ordered gnocci pasta and it looked abysmal. Also, this was some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Once we sat ourselves, it took our waitress more than 30 minutes to notice we existed and to maybe come take our freaking food & drink orders. Getting her attention for refills the rest of the night was a huge hassle as well. 2.) Come for the karaoke only. Their catalog is insanely big and the crowd on a Friday night is extremely enthusiastic and fun. Some talented singers in the bunch too! 3.) Bring Clorox wipes or Purelle to \"anoint\" the mic before you use it. This is VERY important! Approximately TWO days after my karaoke adventure here (in which me & my girl group sang three songs) I came down with a vicious illness- coughing, body aches, sore throat and then laryngitis. I have no doubt where I got it from- the skanky microphones at this dive joint! All but ONE of my four girlfriends also got sick with a similar virus two days later. Unfortunately mine was the most severe. Don't take the chance- sanitize that germ-laden mic before you sing!",

    "text": "Part of me wants to give The Grapevine 5 stars because I thought it was awesome. Just consider this...  - At several points throughout the night our group was the only group of people in the place other than the KJ and bartenders. When this happened the KJ picked songs for us and made us sing them. Songs like I Like Big Butts or Short Dick Man - The KJ joined several songs in accompaniment on the harmonica. - It's a dive bar with karaoke! - At one point the bartender was making me a drink and singing a karaoke song herself.  But, the truth is a 5 star rating might not be entirely fair. Because it is dirty and dim (as a dive bar should be). And personally I think they'd rather have their regulars in here than too many new, hipster-y folks indulging in the irony of singing a Salt-n-Pepa song while the older KJ plays along on his harmonica. And also, the place puts a hurting on your pocket book considering what kind of dive it is. I haven't seen prices this high in a karaoke joint since I last lived in SF. Ouch.",

A silver chinstrap appropriate for a man of his karaoke stature.  That's what this place was all about. Karaoke. Not ambiance, not food, not drinks (see parenthetical note above) but pure, sing-your-heart-out screeching goodness.  When we arrived it was old school obscure songs by the regulars. People who had made bad decisions in their lives but were still clinging to the microphone of hope. Quite unamused by our crowd, they soon cleared out and we darn near had our own private karaoke room, save for the fellow in the Simpsons t-shirt and the ladies who were hooked on singing and may have walked the streets to find The Grapevine.  Loud songs. Country. Inappropriate lyrics and gyrations. And it was all under the watchful whiskers of that magnificent white beard.",

I should've known when I called ahead. The sweet girl on the phone gave us directions. All of my friends were adamant about other places and I was rooting for the nice bartender and the possibility of a song.  When we arrived the place was packed! Yet she still knew I was the one who called (very Children of the Corn). I immediately (at 8:15) put 2 songs in. I said you can just pick one if it fits your line-up. Hoping they'd call me and then one of the 4 people I strung along would add a song in.  This did not happen.   While we each had 3-4 drinks (and 14 songs played), yes, I counted them. Not one persons name was EVER called. It was like a 2-disc CD was playing and they already knew who was next.   If you are new and you are going here to sing. Wait to be disappointed. It's so weird. Not like a cool dive bar weird, but like a scripted twilight zone that you will never be a part of weird.   This bar doesn't need you. They have a following that will always be there. Lesbian softball chicks, older divorcees, old country dudes, and those women who debated on wearing their scrunchees, that dude with dreads that sings the lamest song from the 50s soda shop...amongst others.   And you will still wait. But the CRAZIEST thing is that a name will never be called out. It's like a 3-disc set is playing. Before you know it someone else has the mic in their hand, because it's \"their turn\".   I heard a woman singing Jeff Buckleys \"hallelujah\", which isn't a very popular song. But once I saw every demographic in the place singing it word for word, I knew. This wasn't a place to be reckoned with. You don't see a 60 year old man singing that song, unless they sing it so much you learn it! And that's what happens. It's a CD on rotation.  AND YOU DONT PLAY A PART. Go somewhere else.  14 songs, and you're not going to get called.   My friend said to me jokingly, \"go sit on Santas lap and ask for your song.\" Not that I would have. But it was humorous.   Regardless of naught or nice, Santa will only play that song if he knows you've been coming there for years. Less work. Lazy DJ.   But they don't need you, so don't go.",

Music selection for karaoke was okay. They didn't have quite as much as I had hoped for. Nearly no Kanye West, and sometimes, white girls just need to rap.  I did however manage to get there around 1:15am and was able to sing a song before they closed at 2.  Another downside was the other patrons. People so drunk that they couldn't handle not getting in the middle of EVERYONE ELSE'S SONGS. It's fine to sing along if you know it, but don't stand there and try to sing into my microphone while I'm doing a duet of \"Mr. Roboto\" with my soulmate. GTFO of my facespace.  A random man, very gay, also tried to get with a male friend of ours who is very straight. My hot blonde best friend eventually sat on his lap and still this gay man did not get the hint. Don't get me wrong, I love the gays, but no matter who you are, you shouldn't be forcing yourself on someone who clearly doesn't want it. Male or female.  Come to think of it, a bouncer would have really come in handy in this situation. Fail, Grapevine. Fail.",

I was waiting for my friends to finish their drinks so we could leave and she comes back to see that my water was gone. She then asked if needed more and I said \"sure, thank you\", she smiled sarcastically at me and then walked away without filling my water. I could then see her pointing to me and talking about to to other employees and when she came to pick up our empty bottles/glasses she told me next time I HAD to order a drink and she would remember me.

Although it was busy and I'm sure a little over whelming for the bartender but that doesn't mean someone gets treated like dirt, especially a paying costumer. I walked in and went to the bar to order my very FIRST drink ... did I mention It was my first drink. After I ordered he gave me a price of 19 dollars!!! How can a drink cost so much? So I simply asked why did it cost so much. And the bartender very rudely responded with very frustrated attitude towards me with you're cut off. For asking a price of a drink? Wow never heard of anyone being cut off for asking a question. And I've been in the restaurant industry for over 10 years. He also told me I was cut off because I was talking on my phone.... I didn't know this place was a prison. Can't ask simple questions and for sure don't be on your phone. You'll get treated like dirt if you do. Then I think it was a manager that came over to me and told me I had to leave... never once did she ask me what is going on? Or tried to get down to the bottom of what was going on. This place clearly doesn't want paying costumers to stick around and give their restaurant business.  Horrible experience, very rude unprofessional staff. I will never bring my business here again and I for sure will never tell anyone of my friends or family members to bring their money to this horrible, disrespectful place. I'd give this place no stars but it made me have to choose and Star. But this deserves no stars for how disrespectful they treat their costumers.",

    "text": "I came here late night at about 1am and karaoke was in full swing. I can't comment on the food as I didn't have it and I can barely comment on the drinks. Also, I'm not really a karaoke kind of guy - not singing, not participating, or even watching. It... just isn't really my thing. With that said, I sat in the front part right when you walk in the door. Not too rowdy in that area, you can still hear the karaoke, but not really a part of it either.  In general, I kind of liked it. Goofy. A slightly older crowd (30s was average age I'd say) unlike some places late night in Scottsdale (20s average age). The bartender came over relatively quick even though we weren't AT her bar, which was nice since we could have easily been overlooked.  Kind of hard for me to judge such a place since such places aren't my norm. :)",

This place is so cute and needs to pick a theme and stick with it. If you're looking for a fancy diner this is the place. They had everything on the menu from burgers, pasta, pizza, steak and fish, sandwiches etc. When I see that large of a variety I know the place isn't GREAT at anything.  Just OK at most, and I was right. The food wasn't impressive.",

It boasts a commanding view of Camelback and you can see the goings on on the street below.    It is great to go for lunch or sunset and If you are a sports fan, they have a few big screen tv's.",

    "text": "I will not return to The Grapevine.  We went on a fairly busy Sunday afternoon and the staff was not up to the challenge.  The hostess disappeared for several minutes at a time, leaving many people wondering who to speak to, what to do, or whether they should seat themselves.  When we did get seated, the waitress was even more clueless.  She didn't show up for several minutes, then took a drink order and disappeared indefinitely.  Every time she did anything she was gone for an inordinate amount of time before returning.  This became especially annoying when she gave each of our party of three drink refills one at a time. When the food finally arrived, it was no longer warm, so whatever she had been doing she allowed our food to sit for awhile before she brought it.  Bottom line: the staff had no idea what they were doing and were extremely slow in doing anything.  I now see that this slow service runs through all the Yelp reviews.  Now the food: not horrible, but below average.  Definitely not worth the wait.  The menu spans lavosh, mexican, burgers and gyros.  Too broad a choice for most chefs, and this one was no different.  The chips and salsa were good, and the chips homemade, but that was the extent of it. The rest of the food was very mediocre and room temperature.  There are many good places in the Old Town Scottsdale area, and The Grapevine just doesn't measure up.  You can get better service and better food at many other places in that area.  (As a trivial aside, an example of how clueless the staff was is that on a Sunday afternoon, they had the bar TVs on bowling.  Yes, Bowling!!)",
