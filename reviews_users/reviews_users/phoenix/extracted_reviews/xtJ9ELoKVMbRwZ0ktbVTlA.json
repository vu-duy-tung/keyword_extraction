    "text": "Well, someone beat me in being the first to write a review for this burger joint at the airport.  Wondering around looking for a place, my options were not appealing to my taste buds because the option were very limited at the airport, or at least at  the concourse I was in.  I approached the information desk and asked for guidance and was ask , are you looking to a Burger King? Oh heck no something wayyyyyyy better.  I was directed to Modern Burger which meant 4 moving walkways from my location which would mean a total of 8 (round trip) UGH! I still went for it.  I was not disappointed, the burger was good but its the bread or bun that makes this hamburger. It has the slight sweetness of a brioche. mmmmmmmmmm. The fries? crispy and seasoned.  I did not have a milkshake but not like I needed it since there Iced Tea was enough for me.  Why 4 and not 5 stars? The wait on the first visit was alittle too long, orders are made fresh to order but still I had a chance to sit down and eat as well as catch my plane.  On my layover, guess what I did? Yep headed back to Modern Burger for a redo of my previous order. This place will be on my radar for a few months as I head to Arizona for business and luckily my layover is in Phoenix.",

Staff was kind enough to tell us that we weren't in line - those were just people waiting for their food (you'd think the people waiting would've told us, right?). All in all, a good deal!",

    "text": "Had a short layover in PHX airport terminal A. didn't have enough time to sit at a bar. saw this place and decided to give it a try. i was in the mood for hot breakfast food, but my flight landed at 11am local time. Most of the nearby eateries stopped serving their breakfast food at 10am, so I thought I would have to just \"grab a burger and go\".  Found this place and saw the \"breakfast burger\" on the menu. Got it with the all beef patty, with bacon, fried egg (over easy), tomato, lettuce, cheese and thousand island spread... hell yeah! Hot breakfast food! kindof.. but it hit the spot and it was really good. Did not skimp on the bacon and the mixture of runny egg and cheese gave the texture of a good hash (except with ground beef not corned beef).   Scarfed this sucker down so fast, I have time to write this review before boarding my connecting flight.  didn't order any fries, so can't comment on that. would have ordered hash if they had some, but didn't. this is more of a burger and hot dog joint, not a \"breakfast\" place. But if you're feeling like some breakfast food, but every other eatery in terminal A says it's not the appropriate time for breakfast, take your business to modern burger and get your bacon/egg/cheese fix!  Also ordered coffee. pretty light and standard large volume drip. nothing to write about here. just filled up my thermos for the plane.  Alright! Gotta board my flight, but if you're in the area and need a quick fix, this breakfast burger's da bomb!!!  Price is decent for Airport food. paid $7.50 for breakfast burger with beef and $2.25 for the coffee. Fast service. Great food. Won't miss your flight! Go Go Go!",

Not only is it made fresh, but it's full of great flavor! It was simple, didn't need fancy anything. I love that you can choose grilled v. raw onions. I opted for the grilled and man was I happy with that. They were chopped and caramelized to perfection. I think what got me the most was the bun. It was so soft and went really well with the hamburger meat. They truly blended together.  I'm down to get another burger from here, even if it is overpriced airport food",

As I write this as 9:58pm, they are clearly trying to give off the impression that they are closed by barring the entrances with chairs. It seems that the staff is slightly confused about whether this  is a fast food restaurant at an airport with open seating or a sit down restaurant. I came a quarter to 10 and was unable to get a shake because they had already turned off the machine. Despite my confusion for why they need a machine to refrigerate hand scooped shakes, I was unable to order from their already limited menu. Such is what many travelers are used to at airports but I can only imagine what could have been if the staff were more committed. I can only give a limited recommendation.",

Just my opinion and I ate this burger from its wrapper to minimize the mess in public. I mean I am a lady.   I also thought the price was reasonable. Actually I thought it was cheap but I did just return from the land of the $5 ice tea and $16 omelettes.   In short, stop by and grab a burger when you are hungry.

They were pretty busy but hustling along so we placed our order.  The burger looked great, but tasted not so good.  As I always try to point out the positives, I will say the buns were really good, like a brioche or egg enriched bread.  The main issue was my burger tasted and smelled like dishwater.  It was subtle, but definitely a distinct off taste.  I deconstructed the burger to figure out why it tasted like dishsoap, and I think I narrowed it down the the lettuce and tomato?  the tomato was also pale and unripe.  Maybe somehow the veggies were not rinsed well?  They had a stale industrial sink sanitizer taste. I tasted the meat patty seperately too and it was not good, also had a bit of an off taste, kind of the taste of meat that's been cooked and refridgerated and reheated, even though I know the patty was cooked to order and not reheated.  My kids were not interested in finishing their burgers, and my husband shrugged and said \"it's airport food\".  The fries are standard frozen fast food fries.    I don't think I'll be eating here the next time I'm traveling through PHX.",

No line but had to wait 5 min to place my order while the person behind the counter chatted up an airport worker. I was tempted to leave but had my heart set on a burger. Finally was called to the counter to order.  $14+ for a double burger, fries and a water. The burger: thin fast food style patties with no flavor, I suspect they used the bun to wipe the grease off the grill...sometimes there aren't enough napkins! It was topped with a little bit of lettuce 1 small tomato slice and some very thin 1000 island dressing that had the consistancy of water. Thank god the grease soaked bun repelled the watery dressing, there is nothing worse than bread soaked in water! Or so I thought..... Apparently the top fell off the salt shaker when they were salting the fries or shall we just call them grease sponges? No amount of ketchup could cover the taste of these little gems.  The good news is that my bottle of water was good and uncontaminated by this place.  I have been on a diet for months that prevented me from having burgers...well buns. Was soo looking forword to enjoying this.....next time I'll just keep walking.",

    "text": "Pretty tasty burger!! Very modern looking and refreshing. Sadly it's kinda small and people hover to wait for food, so you might want to bring your food elsewhere. However, I discovered that the space at the next door Olive and Ivy marketplace can be shared even though you eat at modern burger!!!! Hurray.   Another tip for travelers, the wait is about 15-20 minutes during meal hours. So gauge your flight timing!!   Finally, on to the food. I got the breakfast burger - bacon, fried egg, patty, lettuce, tomato and delicious mayo like sauce. It wasn't my favorite  burger BUT I would definitely try it again next time. The fried egg was a little too cooked for my liking but it wasn't noticeable. You can also get extras or tell them to cook your meat a certain way or remove some toppings. My favorite part of the burger was the sauce!!!! The bread was alright.. Kinda soggy. Not the worst though.   I also got the fries. Mmmm not my favorite and I wouldn't recommend it. Fat and soft. And although it might just have been sitting out for 10 minutes, it was cold when I got it. :(  Overall really good for airport food standard.",

The Breakfast Burger caught my eye on their huge wall menu. Fresh ground beef, American cheese, bacon, tomato, lettuce, and fried egg. Everything in it I wanted! I ordered a single patty which came out to about $8. No fries or soda included. Airport food equals airport price.   The burger was fantastic. I didn't really expect much. I was just hungry, period. Pleasantly surprised, the brioche bun was sweet, soft, and buttery. Love it when the starch sticks to the roof of my mouth! The beef patty tasted fresh and delicious, while the bacon was of abundance. Rarely the case and of all places, they got this down. I wish the fried egg had a runny yolk but that's already asking too much, huh?  Nice and pleasant staff over the counter. Seating is limited. Just a bar with a few stools and a couple tables for two. Turnover is fast since everyone's rushing to a flight somewhere. Not bad at all!",

I told her it had to be tried. She loved it and she is from Georgia, they know good Ice Tea. The Hamburgers are great! Cooked fresh and they will put anything you want on them. I am going to say the Fries are only good hot. Not so good once they get cold. But, they serve everything nice and hot. This is always a great place to get some good hot food in the Airport.

I only has about 20 minutes until boarding time for my connecting flight at A5 so I was a little worried whether I'd have enough time to wait for my food and wolf it down before boarding.  Modern Burger is a small shop located between several much larger restaurants but it was still busy.  The cashier and staff looked efficient and so I went for it.  I was pleasantly surprised that my number was called in just about 5 minutes.  The fries were golden crispy and nicely salted.  The burger was about the size of an In-n-Out Double Double.  In other words, just the right size for not feeling disgusted with yourself afterwards.  The patties were juicy and nicely salty from the extra crispy bacon.  You could tell the cheese had been perfectly melted on the patties on the grill.  I'd say this is a 3 napkin burger.  Juicy and a little greasy just like you guiltily want it.  You'd probably annoy the guy sitting next to you on the plane for eating this in your cramped seat.  But screw it.  He's just jealous!",

While we were walking around the US Airways terminal looking for a snack, we came across Modern Burger. I'm pretty hesitant re: airport food but I decided to give it a try. Oh My God. Modern Burger.. please open an outlet in NY. Please. Your Cheeseburgers are amazing. The beef is great quality - as was the salad I opted to put on to of my burger.

It included black beans, pico de gallo, a sprinkling of corn kernels (not from a can because they were really crispy), avocado, and taco strips. At $8, this salad is comparable to the price of other airport meals. It was a substantial salad and everything was very fresh.  I also saw a chopped salad and Chinese chicken salad at the station. The staff was friendly and the line was very short. You can also order other dishes at this station (burgers?).

There weren't that many people there yet they forgot my grilled onions. Normally I'd say something but it became obvious after two bites it would suck with or without onions, so whatever. The taste I see people raving about is steak salt. Fries are ok. Not sure why everyone says the tomato and lettuce are so super fresh, I mean it's not rubber but I wouldn't call it fresh either.  If I come through Phoenix again I'll try something besides the Modern Burger, I think the only \"modern\" thing about it was trying to sell people a shitty product for more money.",

    "text": "Not all food at airports is expensive but most of it is.  Getting ready to get on a flight at Thanksgiving time usually means crowds and very packed restaurants.  That's exactly what it was like.  There would be no way you'd be able to find a table to sit down at without a long wait.  Thus, the search was on for a hamburger.  Not wanting to pay $15 for the one offered at the closest restaurant I decided to do a little walking and discovered Modern Burger.  The sign advertised their single burger at $5!!  That's almost unheard of for a hamburger at the airport.  The line wasn't too long so I was all in for it.  The only issue with the line was the customer ahead of me.  I thought he must have been ordering for the whole airplane.  He took forever.  Food was fast coming out and the hamburger was really good.  Since we fly a lot out of the Phoenix airport, I'm glad to have discovered it.  I'm also sure I'll be back.  Hopefully, there won't be someone ahead of me in line who takes forever to order again.  There actually should have been another person taking orders since everyone behind me also had a flight to catch.",

For $8 & change I didn't even have to pay extra for sour cream and salsa! That was a welcome surprise.  I paid for my quesadilla & stepped to the side to wait for it when I laid eyes on....YES!!! You guessed it love - Flan (One of my favorite desserts - depending on how I am feeling) I look for flan literally EVERYWHERE so what a find. A little overpriced for the 1/2 cup serving but was well worth it to me in the moment. I am really contemplating buying another. For now I will just sit here waiting patiently for my flight.",

I got a cheeseburger with grilled onions fried egg and bacon and fries on a buttered bun. Yes, it was horribly good. Between shaking the grease off my fingers and shoving the seasoned fries into my mouth I was surprised I found time to swallow. This burger hit the spot. A nice big juicy patty, real egg and bacon and the thousand island dressing sauce out it over the top. Man oh man. Fries were crispy good and seasoned with johnnys seasoning salt I believe. Cashier was quick and efficient and the burger was out to me in about 5 minutes or so. Definitely be back if I ever fly through again.",

Unfortunately, whatever hope I had for new, delightful, and different was crushed by reality - its just a facade, a marketing ploy to whip your senses into gear for yet another burger and fries, charge more for it, and, if you follow that line of thinking its more tax revenue - and that is partially why its not a BK. But,  this is all ok, its just par for the course. (I did fall for it, but I remember the Alamo!...so to speak).  What is Modern Burger @ PHX Int. Airport?  - Modern fastfood, modern only in name, high price being its True differentiator (relative to twin arches).    - Small seating area accommodates those wishing to dwell...Kitty corner view of TV at neighboring edtablishment   - Music - The Feelies \"Modern Rythms\", a pioneer of the early 89s alternative sound, True standout!         - <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thefeeliesweb.com&s=488035042f54f81527c99d43740e3753609ad710adac0647309eb335331d52d1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thefeeliesweb.com</a>       - (thank you Shazam!)       - TY MB!..you've totally redeemed yourself!  - Double Bacon Cheese Burger - LTO...greasy, cheesy mess...taste is closest to 5 Guys...I prefer grilled patties to the fried variety....they forgot the L and T so I got that on the side, upside was it was cold..(Take note MB, that's how Root Burger does it, works!)... overall ok, I'd hoped for better. Ate 3 qtrs.  - Fries were excellent - bright spot  - Chocolate shake was basically unmemorable and totally bland  SUMMARY:  $18...eh...not so great for that price, this was a double though. Good place if you need to eat and run and your expectations are just that.",

It was a step up from most fast food but not what a mid range burger joint should be serving. I also got a hot dog and here is what upset me. They have a \"simple\" dog that is just a hot dog or they have a modern hot dog that is really a Chicago style dog with a different name. I didn't want the whole modern hot dog thing so I asked them if they could put onions on the simple dog. They refused, the lady at the counter was adamant that they wouldn't add them. When I explained I didn't want all the other toppings she just looked at me. For a second I thought she had gone mute or lost her ability to speak but she glared at me like I deeply offended her by even asking. Their has to be something said for giving the customer what they want...even an outlandish request like onions. You can keep your mediocre food and poor service Modern Burger.",

I didn't see the breakfast special, which had avocado added for a dollar less than what I paid, in time. I was puzzled at the price difference but considering this was one of the cheaper meals I've had in an airport and I was starving I didn't care that much. The tomato and lettuce were fresh and the bread was delicious, almost like a brioche bun. The bacon was flavorful but a bit on the thin side so it was crispy but not very toothsome. The egg was medium hard. I would have preferred my egg to be cooked to order since I like runny yolks that run over my sandwich but I can understand why they didn't offer that option because it takes more time and since it's travel food most people want neat not messy food.  I was very satisfied and I'll go back next time I fly in to Phoenix. I would definitely try the burger since that's what they specialize in.",

When I picked the burger up the paper was stuck to the bottom and tore half the bun from the wet lettuce and grilled onions. It was too much of something. I'd subtract the lettuce and get raw onions next time. For the price it was just ok.",

To top it off they also had gluten free buns for my wife, which she also said was amazing.   If that's not enough Justin who took our order was especially excellent and also had a very calm and customer service friendly style that made the transaction memorable.   Highly recommend you hit this place up for a great bite!",

One, a double burger no onions and two, a vanilla milkshake.  The milkshake was small but who needs a gigantic cup of ice cream anyway. Not I for sure.  The burger was not under cooked or over cooked but just right. It was very juicy and delicious and the shake was tasty.  My local California place is still my favorite but I'll be back here when I'm in sky harbor.  Bon appetit Travellers",

Compared to other similar breakfast choices Modern Burger was a good option for me. I had the breakfast sandwich: a bacon, egg, avocado and cheese sandwich on a burger bun. It was made in a speedy amount of time and was very filling. The bun was soft and a bit oily, the bacon crisp, and there were large chunks of avocado in the filling. The total was around $8 which is slightly cheaper and had more substance than similar offerings at other restaurants here.   Overall it was a pretty good sandwich and I'd come here again if I wanted a burger or breakfast at the airport.",

They'd been clearly sitting under heat lamp for a while... Some were nearly soggy. I don't like overdone fries but having them crisp on the outside would be nice considering the super high price (almost the cost of the burger) for a side of fries.

I also don't like that there's virtually no seating and it's extremely busy, which makes the whole experience kind of frantic. However if you're running to catch your flight and plan on eating at the gate, it's a pretty good bet; they're very fast. Just be sure to grab some extra napkins.",

I had a mixed greens salad packed with veggies, baked chicken, and hard boiled eggs with a light dressing. I was very impressed by how nutritionally balanced all their selections were! If you're someone who watches what they eat, this is a great choice :)",

It's located amongst all the other notable places in Terminal 4, but I specifically chose it as I was looking for a good burger and heard many good things about the locations outside the airport.  The burger was indeed a solid burger, the patty had a nice sear on the outside, was juicy on the inside, and seasoned well. The bacon was plentiful and the cheese was melted juuuust right. The fries have to be bought separately and they were pretty decent, just not quite worth the price and/or calories right before vacation.  The food came out really quickly and was fresh and hot. Price was reasonable for airport standards. I left satisfied and pretty full after my meal and definitely would come again. It was a short trek from one concourse to the other, which is good for burning some of those calories off if you got to the airport too early!",

Onion rings are good albeit a bit too done I still enjoyed them.

My flight was delayed over 3 hours, and after eating a lot of sandwiches and pastries in the preceding day or two, I was only up for a burger. Zinburger happened to be right next to my gate. Even though their menu selection is small, they still had choices I was interested in. I'm a bacon guy, so their Samburger loaded with applewood bacon, cheese, dressing, etc, sounded perfect. Oops....out of bacon. Okay, so it wasn't a deal-breaker. They offered me the Plain and add cheese for free. I substituted the mayo for spicy mayo (was hot! ) Also got the strawberry shake to make it an all-American pastime.  The double-patty burger was delicious, juicy, plenty of taste (thanks partly to the spicy mayo). An abundance of melted cheese made each bite ooze with satisfaction. Was just one heck-of-a good burger, especially for an airport burger joint. Strawberry shake was not very thick, which is actually the way I prefer it. That way I'm not spending the first few minutes breaking my jaw to get something through the straw (hey, that rhymes).  If I get stuck at PHX again, this is where I'm going!",

I started to look for some different options to grab some breakfast and with my love for burgers, as soon as I seen Modern Burger I knew it was a perfect fit.  I walked up to the counter and placed my order, paid with a credit card and took my drink and set in the small seating area that all faces the terminal.  Obvious great people watching while you eating.  Always a plus!  Within 3 or 4 min they called my number and I grabbed my breakfast burger.  Burger with cheese, and egg, bacon, tomatoes and lettuce.   It was delicious and totally hit the spot.  It wasn't too small or too big, it was just he right size to fill you up but not make you regret eating it all as you walk away.  Salute to you Modern Burger!",

The burger is nothing special; in fact, it was just mediocre at best, I could not even hold the burger properly with my hands, as all the ingredients spilled all over the place, and so I have to grab a fork to actually eat this \"burger.\" The bottom bun was soggy, and the meat patty was pretty burnt. The non burnt sides of the party was solid, but I think they did a sloppy job producing this burger, which was a disappointment.",

Then they went and changed everything! Now it is Zinburger but owned by the same people. The prices went up. You can only get a burger well done. Now, there is no where to sit since they removed the counter too.  For some reason today, it took them forever to get my one burger done. Several people after me got theirs with fries and shakes and they received their order before me. It did not make sense since mine was just one item and I ordered before them. So strange since they ordered the same burger I did.   Oh well, I guess it is time to find a new place to enjoy!",

Should've walked away when the apathetic and surly girl behind the counter called the guy in front of us up and when he placed his order, told him they weren't ready to take orders yet! And it went downhill from there.  We ordered at 0459 and got our breakfast sandwich at 0512.  We were the second customers in line, and watched as five customers following us got their food first.  The place was chaos, there was no tracking of orders customers were just given food, presumably what they ordered, but not according to any system, the girl at the counter kept her back to the customers and stared into the kitchen, she was surly and rude and should most definitely be fired from customer service.  Customers just looked at one another and shook their heads.  We warned one guy off, he thanked us and left.  I have never seen anything like it.  I was truly worried about food poisoning, if the kitchen was so poorly managed what would the cleanliness be like?

Modern Burger restored my faith (if there ever was faith there to begin with) with its reasonable prices, fast service, and most importantly: seemingly really good food.  Have I lost you yet? Good food from a quick service counter in an airport? I do have to say that being absolutely starving after having landed for a layover and not really expecting too much has a lot to do with it. Modern Burger was right by the gate I exited out of and being a burger guy through and through it seemed like a sign from heaven.  I got the Breakfast Burger and it ended up being about $8 with the addition of a fried egg. Fries and a drink would've been an additional $3. The burger was cooked well, flavorful, and hit the spot. I didn't have to wait long either which justified me getting the burger in the first place knowing full well how short of a layover time I had.  Check it out if you ever find yourself passing by here. Definitely gave me enough fuel to endure a long flight. I've yet to find better quality/tasting airport quick service food.",

Usually will try to find a good burger place whenever I travel. Modern burger had the same amount of stars but the prices were REALLY reasonable and we could get an egg on our burger. My husband was over me yelping all the restaurants so we went with modern burger with low expectations. I did like the design of this place (white brick wall, metal white industrial chairs)   The lady who helped us was really nice! Ordered a single patty ($5.50) and added an egg. ($1) She instinctively asked us if we were splitting (we were!) and said she'd cut it in half. How kind! Added an order of fries and asked for 2 water cups. She gave us 2 large cups of ice water.  The burger was cut in half and individually wrapped! also very thoughtful. Took a bite and immediately wished I got my own burger ;)   The burger was very good and tasty! It was really juicy with the thousand island and full with lettuce, tomatoes and the fried egg. I liked the bun but it was on the thin side, could have been a little better.   The fries were okay but the salt seasoning they added helped with the taste and made them smell delicious :)  Overall, I'd definitely eat here again. Really impressed with the service and quality of food - i never really leave a review after I go to a place but this place left an impression... plus I'm waiting to board my plane ;) thanks modern burger!",

There aren't too many days I can pull off eating a burger in the morning so when I had the chance, I jumped on it.   The cashier was friendly and the burger came out quick. Too quick actually. I knew then that it wasn't going to be the best burger ever, and I was right, but it sufficed.   The Breakfast Burger had a little beef patty that was just a notch above a typical fast food chain in quality. There's also some kind of sauce on it that I didn't care for. On the bright side, the lettuce and tomato tasted fresh, and the bacon was think cut and very good. Having a fried egg on a burger is rarely a bad thing either.   Not the worst place for an airport burger fix. It hit the spot, while also making me feel like I was living on the edge just a bit.   Although, I wouldn't rush to have this Breakfast Burger again... if you want to rebel against morning, I also wouldn't dissuade you.",

They do pre made salads that look tasty and I had a Chinese Style Chicken Salad in my hand I was about to get and changed my mind thinking a fresh made breakfast burger might be better. I may have been expecting too much since I was expecting a yummy burger tasty like a Zinburger. But what I got was more like a really good fast food type burger. Like what a Whopper Jr might be like if it was good. It was a very thin small patty maybe the same size as a Whopper Jr beef patty I guessing a two oz. patty. I do note the patty was cooked nice but not so tasty. The bun was soft and eggy tasting but a lot of bread for the little patty that didn't fill the bun. My egg slice was cooked very hard and was chalky. It was sort of messy with thousand Island dressing squirting out all over.  Depending on how you look at it the burger was really good if you compare it to a Whopper Jr but it cost like 5x more or it's lousy if you compare it to a burger you cooked in a pan or on the grill.  I should have went with the Chinese Style Chicken salad with canned oranges on it.  2.5 Stars",

    "text": "The food was GREAT when I initially ate it. Egg + burger + in n out like sauce + grilled onions + affordable pricing in an AIRPORT = heaven. However, I believe I got a stomach flu from this joint. I hadn't eaten anything other than my burger at Modern Burger, and when I flew back to my home city I experienced the worst sort of nausea EVER. Up came the burger and all it's leftovers. Sick.  Eeek!! Methinks not so much.",

    "text": "Best airport burger I've had (been to about 20 airports in the last year, some multiple times), and comparable to the quality and taste of most real sit-down restaurants that are available in these bastions of cattle herding known as air travel.  and it's actually reasonable prices (for an airport) - around $5 for the burger itself which is probably the best tasting one you can get at any restaurant inside PHX. add a bit more for fries and/or a drink.  I went for the chocolate shake myself instead of the other side options and it was damn tasty.  never will I settle for a Burger King or McDonalds in a smelly terminal again.   reasonably quick too, though not a ton of seating there is plenty in the two adjacent food service stops (all owned by the same folks so you can more or less sit anywhere you like.  Thank you Phoenix Sky Harbor for adding this place!!  would go back in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "I never thought I would give an airport burger place a 5 stars. Yes, it was a perfectly cooked bacon double cheeseburger. Better than Five Guys, better than most burger joints I have been to.   They really care that you have a good experience even though you are passing through and may never be back. For me, I'll be back because I go to Phoenix a lot.   The manager also made a difference. He actually walked by and asked customers how their food was -  like it was a high end restaurant. He then remembered me when I got in line again for another drink.   Fast service, good burgers, good fries.",
