I've tried calling the number advertised on Google and the website and the number goes to a voice message saying you reached the wrong extension. Want to purchases eight tickets in advance for your party or group? This place does not sell tickets in advance like AMC, Harkins, or iPic. If you try calling and by some miracle receive a person, they can never tell you for sure when tickets will go on sale or what times. Sometimes for blockbusters, the showtime will be around 7 or around 10p.m., and maybe it will be around 8 p.m.  It's a surprise every time!   Once after trying three times to get a live person to see Spider Man Homecoming, I was told that the tickets will go on sale a week before opening night  (all other major theatres had went on sale a month before). The sale date from Roadhouse was a lie. AMC got my business instead.   The food is mediocre and the portions are small. Pricing is the same as most dine-in movie theatres.   All in all, I will only come to this theatre if I have to or do not need to purchase several tickets for my group. So frustrating.",

It's close to my place in Scottsdale, so I can easily Lyft if I want to drink a few and they have a happy hour between 3-6pm. They have a good amount of drafts, and I usually get the Ghost burger or the Nacho Libre. If you want a cool treat, get a Gelato shake with bourbon in it. It's great that you can reserve your seat beforehand, except when all the recliners around you are empty and some creep gets a seat right next to you, after you have already reserved. I don't know what the other people are complaining about, the staff are great, from the bartenders to the servers. The staff have a tough job, serving food in a dark movie theater. The girl who does the art work on the board is a fantastic artist. Loved her Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. The people complaining about this theater must be entitlement liberals.",

For someone who doesn't like spending time to watch movies, they've hooked me on wanting to see every film out just to get to go back.   For two student tickets on a Thursday night for a brand-new movie it was $18. We ordered beers and an appetizer platter for a grand total of about $50. The food was a little expensive, but that's expected at a movie theatre. It's definitely worth it. I really appreciate their multitude of vegetarian and vegan options! They have black bean burgers that you can replace any of the regular burgers with.   The seats were so comfy! You could fully recline and put the arm rest up to get cozy with your partner.   It's a great spot for a first date or a family outing. I'd recommend trying to go during lunch or happy hour to save money and still enjoy the full experience. I can't wait to go back!",

We just had an over $2000 engagement ring stolen because the management refused to let my girl back into the theater room after her movie had finished.

My friend and I came early to have an appetizer and drink before our show. All of the beers on tap are brewed locally in Arizona. Our server recommended the goat cheese appetizer and it did not disappoint. Topped with figs and pumpkin seed and with crostini for dipping- it was amazing.  Absolutely delicious!  On our way into the movie we eyed the concession stand and were offered samples of their fantastic gelato. They also have cookies, cheesecake, some candy and 4 different flavors of popcorn. You can order any of this from inside the movie, as well as drinks or anything off the main menu.   The theater chairs were super spacious and comfy, and you can use the recliner to put your feet up and relax. The attached table and drink holder swings comfortably for your food and drinks, or can be easily pushed out of your way when you're done eating.   Ticket prices were very reasonable and apparently Tuesdays are $6 movies all day. Food and drinks were also reasonable priced - I spent $10 on a drink and shared appetizer, and $10 on dinner. My friend got popcorn for $7 which was bottomless and on our way out they offered to bag it and top it off for her so she took home a big bag of popcorn!  I would highly recommend this theater!! Very fun evening out.",

We bought our tickets last minute and first row was our only option, it wasn't bad at all though! The reclining chairs are amazing. For our food we shared the appetizer platter, I think called the road trip? It was a nice way to try a little bit of everything. Our favorite part was the soft pretzel and cheese. The fries were ok, the quesadilla was yummy!  My only reason for taking a star away was the service. I'm usually easy to please when it comes to service but we both noticed our server seemed grumpy and annoyed with us. First we asked if we could swap out something else for the chicken tenders (I'm a vegetarian), she didn't say no or yes just kinda seemed mad that we'd even ask so we said nevermind because my boyfriend could eat them. Then I asked if they could put the chicken tenders on a separate plate for us and she basically said no and served it all on the same plate. Not the biggest deal ever, I just feel like that's not much to ask to just have the chicken on a different plate and they wouldn't accommodate. Otherwise a great time though and I'd love to come back.",

The theater is a little difficult to find, and you don't purchase tickets outside, or show your voucher there, you go inside to the counter and have them redeem it. The seats are all really great, and the white cheddar popcorn was delicious. I like the quality of the chairs quite a bit as some of the places I've been they've been so-so. Service is great for drinks (I cannot vouch for food as I have never had anything but the popcorn) but it didn't look too awful. The one complaint I have is that depending on where you are in the theater the women's restroom is decently far away from the men's room. All in all I will definitely come back! On tuesdays they have $6 specials!",

I talked to the manager after the movie and explained to him what happened and he told me he legally couldn't remove liquor from the bill.

The food and drink selection was much better than other dine-in theaters in the Phoenix area. We enjoyed our beers and the food that we ordered. Our server was genuine and attentive to us and everyone she was serving. Though we were seeing the later movie on a Tuesday night, we did not get any negative response from any of the employees at the theater which was nice. The chair were comfortable and the theater was well-kept. When you first enter the theater, there is a large bar lounge area with a patio.

Most of the movie was well into 70 - 90 decimal range ...way to loud.  The theatre has lights on all over the place so that the film reflects the fixtures and the black tones are more like grey tones. So, shitty sound and ruined cinematography  I already mentioned bad service. Now I must add terrible sound control...lighting, and the manager? When I complained she did nothing. She has ears.  I saw them on her head... Did she think I was complaining for fun?  It was painful. I had wadded up napkins in my ears the whole time.  I told hubby we're done with that theatre, he agrees. Hotter than hades. fried shitty food, slow service , lights on,  the theatre was empty.  They deserve no business.  The food is not good.  I take back what I said earlier.

    "text": "NOT impressed. Or maybe I just had super high expectations, as its in fufu Scottsdale. Came here on a groupon, since it was a smoking deal. Mind you, living downtown, we have a dine in theater on Camelback much closer. Thought I would give this place a try though just for the hell of it. Took the kiddo to see Cars 3. I will say, the actual theater itself is gorgeous. Nicely decorated, very clean. The seats get 5 starts. Very comfortable. The service though was horrific. Just terrible. The poor woman next to me (who I didn't come with) had to ask the girl 3 times for her sprite. This was a daytime movie showing it was NOT packed. THEN (the same waitress) told me that for part of the groupon (2 beers or 2 sodas included) that it had to be the same drink I couldn't do 1 beer and 1 soda. WHAT THE HELL. I said okay my 8 year old will take a beer then. What kind of rule is that, is it not common to have a minor with you at a movie theater? AND on top of that, I would think your cost for soda is MUCH cheaper than the fancy beers you serve. Needless to say, my child got gipped of his soda (sorry lol) and I got the 2 beers. I got 2 different kinds, don't ask me what ones. Both were good. The popcorn was ice cold. Didn't even bother complaining. It was just not a good experience. The groupon was a great deal, but I would not come back without one even if I was in the neighborhood.",

The popcorn is delicious, the reclining seats were ultra comfortable, and the ticket prices are similar to what you'd pay at a Harkins, not a bit over the top like iPic.

    "text": "My husband and I were staying in Scottsdale for a few days and, after days of exploring and adventuring, we were too tired to do anything but see a movie by the time the evenings rolled around. So we made our way to the RoadHouse Cinemas to catch up on some flicks. We liked it so much we went two nights in a row!  First, put your feet up in an incredibly comfy recliner chair. Then, order some eats. We recommend the \"children of the corn\" popcorn and the soft pretzel for starters. My husband wasn't the biggest fan of his chicken sandwich, but I really liked my burger. I thought it was great. Juicy and perfectly cooked. And the fries with the garlic aioli on the side are fantastic. I also had the brownie sundae one night. The gelato was great. I'd probably ditch the sundae portion of that in the future and just get that by itself.   The process is easy, they drop food off while you're watching the flick and your bill 30 minutes before the movie ends. We got their early enough both times that we were able to give our card before the film started so check out was a breeze.   The chairs are incredibly comfy and everything, from the lobby to the bathrooms, to the screening rooms, are clean and welcoming. It's not the cheapest night out (tickets were $13.50 plus food and drink if you're so inclined) but it's a really well-rounded night out and a really fun experience if you're a movie goer who likes all the bells and whistles.",

We ultimately decided to come because we found a pretty awesome Groupon deal - $21 for two tickets, popcorn and 2 beers/soda.   Of course, we ordered 2 craft beers. We also decided to go with the white cheddar popcorn and I think they called it 'The Great White'. Supposedly, the popcorn is bottomless and non-GMO. I'm a fan of white cheddar but I wish it had come out warm. Ours was room temperature.   While there were many options for food, we decided to split the 'Road Trip for Two' which included two pieces of quesadilla (rice, beans & cheese inside), two chicken tenders, a soft pretzel shaped like the letter 'R' and cheese sause, ranch and salsa. With that and popcorn, it was enough to fill us and we did not order more. When my boyfriend went to the bathroom, he noticed some burgers and said they looked really good! So we'll have to try it next time!  Comfy reclining seat and tray tables that are large enough to hold everything you need. Looking forward to coming here again!",

I had been looking for a more upscale movie theater where you can drink beer, grab a bite, recline your seat and not be around teenagers. I must be getting old!  We have now been here multiple times and it is our go-to movie theater. We always get our tickets a day or two in advance, and grab a beer beforehand. The food is pretty decent - portions can be small for the price, but it's a whole experience and I wouldn't expect it to be cheap. Try the flatbread and the jalapeno popcorn! But prepared to eat in the pitch dark, which can be challenging. Because of that, I'm thinking I might start eating elsewhere and just getting a drink or popcorn during the movie, but I will still come here for date nights because the overall experience is always positive.  Normal movie theaters are old news. I can't fathom going back to that and spending the same amount of money for a bad seat and loud people surrounding me. RoadHouse is the way to go!",

We asked about the tickets and he told us that because of the high volume of people trying to see the movie, the website had crashed and glitched. We asked for store credit so we could just come another night since the other showings were so late. When we tried to use our store credit for another night, we were told that we couldn't because of a deal Roadhouse made with Disney that they couldn't use any passes/coupons for the first two weeks. Are you kidding me...so we had to cough up another almost $30 for tickets for another night. They also told us it's been happening to a bunch of other customers. If this is the customer service we got, I feel bad for the rest of the customers as well. This is my #1 go-to theater, but the service is quickly going downhill.",

However, I was slightly disappointed that a Dining cinema would serve white cheddar popcorn as simply regular popcorn with fake movie cheese powder. I also got the chicken nachos, and although the chicken was dry and the queso was not fresh, it was still a solid movie snack. What truly made the experience enjoyable was the comfortable recliner chairs and the quick service of drinks and food from the waiter.",

    "text": "I love this theater.  What a concept!  The seats are high quality recliners and there is so much space between the rows that you aren't going to get kicked by someone's jerkoff kid, and you might even be far enough away from those people who eat their popcorn with their mouth open and who play with their Twizzlers wrapper the entire movie.  We've been here twice and enjoyed both visits.    The first time we had eaten before we got there, so we just ordered a beer.  I love that they have a good variety of local brews to choose from.  And the prices are what...$5.25 or $5.50 a pint?  Something like that.  Perfectly reasonable.  We saw some of the food go by and wanted to at least try a burger on our next visit.  One thing I also liked a lot about our first visit was that a server stopped by our seats before the movie and asked us if it was our first time.  When we told him it was, he went through a rundown on the ordering and check delivery process.  It was smooth sailing.  The only complaint I have is that it was kind of hot in the theater.  Usually I'm freezing my jumblies off in a movie theater, but it was a little warm on this visit.  The second time it was cool in the theater and we did try a burger.  We shared the Tombstone burger ($10.50) and enjoyed that very much in spite of the fact that they cook all the burgers medium well.  Come on now.  Let me have a medium or medium rare burger.  I can handle it.  The burger does not come with any fries.  You have to order those separately.  My husband had a beer and I tried their sangria which was very refreshing.  I could have had 3 or 4 of those but managed to control myself.    Overall I'm very impressed with the quality and variety of food & drink options, friendly staff, and comfortable seats.  We'll be back many times.",

    "text": "They have a wide selection of food and drinks and the seats are super comfy. I came with my husband twice and we had one great experience and one terrible experience. Both times we used the Groupon with the popcorn, 2 tickets, and 2 beers included. The first time was perfect. I checked the menu ahead of time because I am allergic to beer and they even have two cider options. We got there with plenty of time before the movie to order dinner and get settled into our spots. The service was great, the food was delicious, and our overall experience was as good as it gets. We left more excited about the experience that we just had than we were about the movie we saw- and it was Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 so that's saying something.  We came back in hope of seeing Wonder Woman a week after opening weekend, but the theaters were packed days ahead of time and I'd rather wait a week or two than sit in a bad seat, so we decided to see Pirates 4. We got there 30 minutes early and ordered food. When ordering the popcorn, we hesitated and the waiter started telling us about a secret menu. There were a ton of options that I can't remember, but we ended up going with the Windy City popcorn (a mix of caramel and white cheddar). When ordering our drinks I asked for a cider, but they were out of both. I asked it I could sub in a wine, but they said no. I asked if they could make an exception as I am terribly allergic to beer and I explained the extent of my allergy (long story short it isn't pleasant). He needed supervisor permission, but he came back and said they could. I saw my favorite red wine on there, but it was a couple bucks more than beer so I offered to pay the difference which they said was not needed.   The food and drink came shortly after the film started and it was great. At the hour mark, my glass was empty and I wanted to switch to a sweeter wine for dessert so I wrote down my choice, flipped the order switch, and handed the paper to a waitress without a word. The movie is pretty good so I lose track of time until my water runs out and realize it's been 30 minutes. I scribble down a request for water and the wine again with a note on the bottom saying \" * I ordered the wine 30 minutes ago, but it never came. Can you check on it?\". 15 minutes later the water and wine came and I went back to enjoying the movie.   They bring your check at the end of the film and when I was getting up from my chair I noticed that I had been charged incorrectly. They charged me for three glasses (2 of the red wine -the more expensive of the two- and 1 of the sweet wine) and applied the discount to the cheaper of the three. I half expected them to charge me for 3 instead of 2 when they forgot my wine, so I flagged someone down in the theater and an asked them to fix the charge. My husband waited for the corrected copy while I was in the restroom. He met me outside and I checked the receipt just to be safe. This time I noticed that they put the two reds again and didn't apply the Groupon this time. So we go up to the front and I get a supervisor so that I can make sure it is done right on the third try.   I explain the situation and there must have been a shift change during our movie because she gets upset that someone let me get a wine instead of beer. I go through the long spiel about my allergy again and she is still unhappy, but she walks away to fix it. We wait for about 10 minutes and I watch as they not so discretely start asking employees about our order clearly suspicious of us. Unfortunately our original waiter is gone, but the waitress who forgot about my order for 45 minutes comes and starts talking about me saying that I never put in the first drink order and that I clearly drank the sweet white before the red because that's the correct order to drink wine (normally True, but I was craving a sweet wine for dessert, plus who dubbed her the theater sommelier?). She didn't even serve me the first glass so I don't know why she is fighting so hard on this.  They come back the third time and it is done almost correctly with the white wine gone completely and just the red wine on the receipt. Since the manager and I are reviewing it together I point out that the red was the one the Groupon applied to, but that I'm tired of sitting here so to just charge my card and be done with it. She goes to swipe my card and it declines which I wasn't surprised about since it has now been charged and refunded 3 times. I call my card company and explain the situation and they unfreeze my card. By the end of that call another manager has taken over . He came to our aid, finally got it right, and apologized for the inconvenience. We left stressed out and with about $150 waiting to be refunded back to us which took a couple days.  I think this place is just new and still learning from experience so I plan to come back, but I'm going to give them a few months to get their staffing in order before returning.",

The food bill came to $70...this was for 3 fountain drinks (which run about $4 or $5 each), two burgers, one of which was a plain cheese burger, two orders of fries (because EVERYTHING on the menu MUST be ordered a la carte) and a popcorn.  The popcorn ($8) I ordered was the jalapeno one. It was supposed to come with slices of jalapenos all over it. It did not. It also had a weird powder seasoning on it. I sent it back and opted for just the original popcorn with butter, Children of the Corn, I believe it was called. That also tasted awful so we didn't eat it.  We got one Blockbuster burger with a steak meat patty ($10), one plain Cheeseburger ($10) which they still charged us the price of the Blockbuster Burger), Pub fries ($6), Buffalo chicken sandwich ($10) and Southwest Loaded fries ($6). All the food was just edible, at best. Nothing special to warrant their prices.  We didn't bother to order a dessert because we didn't feel like paying $10 for a slice of cheesecake.  With prices like these and forced to pay for everything separately, our money could have been better spent elsewhere.  3 out of 10...would not recommend.",

The drinks are over priced, $22 for a Tito's double with club soda but alas they gave me a well and sprite and when I put the call button on it took 22 minuets for someone to come, 30 more minuets for them to bring a new drink and by then I was about ready to dump it on the rude girls head when I complained about the long wait for a drink and she gave me attitude. Told her to take it back that I didn't want it any longer and she did but it still appeared on the bill. The burger was overcooked to well when I asked for mid rare and the appetizer didn't show up till after the entrees. We will never go back. Interesting also that they have that great outdoor patio space in front that is always empty and never being utilized. It just looks like a ghost town and the service and food are second rate.",

We then reserved our seats online which was cool that we could reserve where we wanted to sit before we got there. They recommend that you get there 30min early to look over the food menu so we did. We walked into the front door and saw they have a restaurant to the right and ticket desk and concession is off to the left. We went to the ticket desk and they scanned my phone that had our purchase code and we were off to find our seats. Easiest transaction ever. Once we got to our seats and settled in we pushed the call button for our waitress. She scanned one of our tickets to claim our Groupon popcorn. You could choose from 3 different kinds. We got regular popcorn with butter. It was not your run of the mill theater popcorn. It was some of the best popcorn we have ever had! The seats are super comfy and they have a full menu of yummy food. Our waitress was excellent and super nice. I have a gluten and soy allergy and she took it very seriously which I always appreciate. She even called the head  chef that wasn't there at the time to confirm if their homemade GF pizza crust had soy flour in it...it doesn't FYI. We got the GF pesto pizza and it was excellent! One of the best GF pizzas we have had. We also sampled their gelato which was sooo yummy! Over all the funniest movie night ever! Unfortunately this experience has spoiled us and any normal theater will just fail in comparison.",

The dinner arrived fast and was good however nothing to drink and no popcorn.  30 mins & 4 button pushes later, getting out of my seat and asking were our drinks and popcorn were and then being promised we'll get it right to you they finally brought my wives drink and not mine.  20 mins later mine arrives.  6 more button pushes and 40 more mins with the server showing up each time and saying it isn't here yet?  we finally get some popcorn.  Of Course the movie is almost over. They seem to have no tracking or accounting for anyone's order or what has or hasn't arrived.  I would have enjoy a drink with my meal let alone couldn't even get my refill that was asked for.  The popcorn was terrible and kept me up all night with stomach problems.  I think they must have gotten me the bottom of the barrel or something because they messed up so much and just brought me what was left. Do they clean the popping container ever. Was sick until 9am the next morning when it wore off.  Felt great until eating that 75 min later popcorn.     I think I'll go to other places where I can enjoy a movie and not be getting up and down to find out where my meal is.  I would rather stand in line and get it then have to wait forever and keep getting \"can I help you\" \"oh you haven't gotten it yet, I'll bring it out\"    Really sucks to watch your entire row get seconds and you not even get one drink.",

However, this place exceeded my expectations by far. The food is actually GOOD, not mediocre like other full service theaters I've been to and their prices are on point! They do \"Happy Hour\" every Tuesday so movie tickets are only $6 ALL DAY! Seats are clean, comfortable and fully recline as well.",

There is also a sign outside and on the website that says no kids under 6 permitted. Yet there is a changing table inside and I see toddlers often. I've been turned away once with my son but that was when it first opened. Now there are toddlers often. Especially with the summer children's movies. My advice is to buy tickets online because you get to choose your seat. Don't wait till the last minute because most shows do sell out. It's the best affordable movie theatre.",

The only reasons I gave a 4 star review is because there are some simple housekeeping opportunities and the tea I got last visit tasted awful. I haven't had a problem before so I assume it was just a one time bad batch.  Otherwise, friendly staff, great atmosphere, and really comfortable viewing experience.",

    "text": "*Beware Food Poisoning!!* Last night my boyfriend and I decided to go to RoadHouse, in all honesty we would have been better off going to a regular movie theater. It all began with poor service, one item of the food we ordered came out before our beers. We had to ask the server who brought out our food (not our original server) for the rest of our meal. We ordered the jalapeno popcorn, two beers, and a pizza. About 10 minutes later the rest of our order arrived. We just thought of it as a slight annoyance and nothing more. It was only after the movie was over is when we experience pure agony. As we were walking to the vehicle we noticed that our stomachs felt a little funky. We decided to take a couple Tums to help with the problem, sadly that did not work. For the rest of the night we suffered from food poisoning. It was the worst food poisoning I have ever encountered. Just save your money and go to a regular movie theater because this is not worth the food poisoning. **** This is the same review I left on Google.",

I had dark chocolate and I swear it tasted like frozen chocolate mousse.  And then I sampled the strawberry cheesecake and it had the sweet tartness of actual cheesecake.  So good.    Final awesome thing, a $9.95 price tag for an after matinee movie.  It was all around an awesome experience.",

First off the manager of this location is about 20-21 so it Starts there,  you know what your in for just from experience. Second, clean the place up, floors are dirty, tables looked like they were cleaned with dirty water, menus are sticky with who knows what, A/C feels like swamp coolers not real A/C, the sound levels are too low. Third, the food is just blah, food comes to you luke warm, taste like it's been sitting waiting to be sent to customer. Drink service is a complete joke, why does it take 30 minutes to get a drink. Beer needs to be way colder then it is being served, chilled glass would be great. The kids making the food could be cleaner in my opinion also, hair nets, gloves, hygiene goes along ways. This all boils down to managers and workers that are too young and flat out don't care. The popcorn is good for what's it's worth. In the meantime I'll be looking for a new place to catch a movie, maybe I'll come back in 6 months and see if this place has cleaned there act up..",

The theater and the chairs were nice, it is clear they invested a lot of money to try to make it a good experience.  However I was SO pissed over my experience with the food that it took a full hour before I was able to relax.  Wife and I order each order a drink, she got the Freebird and I got the Rooster Cogburn.  Food comes out, turns out the bartender rung in the wrong thing, says don't worry we will get it fixed.  I'm not sweating it at this point, stuff happens.  We eventfully get the right food, mine is bleh her's is okay both of our fries are cold and gross, not even the catchup could save them.  So semi incompetent service, bleh food, we are disappointed but move on.  We are late for the movie so I get the check and pay quickly so we don't miss any of the movie.  While in the theater I review the tab.  The item he rung in incorrectly is $10 on a menu, he rung it in at $15.  My dish is $10 on the menu, rung in at $15.  He charged us for the dish he rung incorrectly, then gave us a credit $3 less than what he had charged.  Normally I would raise this with the manager but at this point I was just done.  Hopefully we will get a well run theater in there someday.",

    "text": "6/19: we are back! We love the beer and the popcorn - going for the cheddar + jalapeno mix.  We tried Lynch before the movie.  For $5 the pretzel is delicious except for a few bucks more at OHSO or Four Peaks you get 2 big pretzels. We also got the hummus. SUGGESTION: please take a nod from Pita Jungle and give more hummus. We got a tiny dollop of hummus but the sun dried tomatoes and roasted garlic were great.  We still are disappointed by the fact that the nachos we saw people ordered still look like the ones we got a few weeks ago and they don't look anything like the nachos in the menu.   HINT: make them like the ones in the menu picture! Go to Two Bothers in old town where for about the same price you get a huge plate of nachos with cheeses, beans, chimichurri save, etc.  I will happily continue to come for the beers and popcorn and unmatched chairs in the theater, but the regular food needs to be addressed still.   Let me be clear... This is a food and service review. When it comes to the comfort of the in-theater seating the experience is 5 stars. I do wish that the lighting was brought down a bit for the servers....  Everything else needs work.  Bar: Wife and I sat at the bar for snacks and beer before our movie started. We ordered jalapeno popcorn (really good but heavy on the seasoning) and nachos.  The picture in the menu - a delicious stack of cheese, beans, avocado, sour cream drizzle, and more - had no resemblance to the community pool nachos we got. Chips, cold cheese sauce, no beans, and lettuce and tomatoes tossed on top. We sent it back. HINT: if you are a new place and someone sends food back the. Dispatch a manager immediately to see why.  Here is the \"best part\". We asked for two beers. The bartender - straight face - asks if we want one fresh and then one that \"she poured earlier tonight by accident\". YOU DONT ASK SOMEONE IF THEY WANT AN OLD BEER THATS BEEN SITTING IN THE WINE FRIDGE!!!  Last thing... We carried out popcorn and beers down to the theater. One of the in-theater servers asked to not do this in the future, but to order from them for the \"full experience\". It was not very welcoming.  We want to really like this place but we are not motivated to eat there after the nachos. Will try again once they get their legs under them.  Incredible seats and all local AZ beers make it a 5 star establishment for beer and a move, though!",

Pricing was fair on the happy hour munchies, but don't know why popcorn runs the same price as a huge platter of food! It seems insane to pay the same price for popcorn as you do chicken fingers, quesadilla, fries and soft pretzels. I would love to see popcorn added to the happy hour menu. The one issue with the platters was the lack of sauce. The one came with sour cream, salsa and cheese sauce and the other came with salsa, cheese sauce and ranch.   I think they either shorted us ranch on one or sour cream on one since they were the same item (we didn't realize until after the server left and the movie was already going so we just made due). Needless to say without ranch dressing the chicken fingers were a little dry (but lots of chicken breast meat). I would honestly love to see even two packs of ranch on each platter because it was so good. The cheese sauce for the soft pretzel was amazing, I think the soft pretzel was my favorite, the chicken fingers probably would have been if it wasn't for the lack of sauce. The quesadillas were okay, a little cool by the time they came so not as good as they could have been. The fries were solid.   Drinks were reasonable at happy hour, and seems crazy a beer is nearly the same price as an Italian soda! Seats were comfortable, but should be cleaned between viewings as I had to wipe some oil off mine (assigned seats and all). Server was nice, wait for food was a little long, at least you have something to watch on the screen.  My biggest pet peeve would be the volume of the movie, it was a little too loud and some parts were just plain obnoxious. I think if they lowered the volume even 20% it would be perfect. I'm concerned the volume is close to almost causing hearing damage (yes it was that loud).   More ranch dressing, clean seats the first time, hot quesadillas, happy hour popcorn and slightly lower volume and this place would get a 5 star from me.  Update: Did a follow up visit for July 4th. They ran their Tuesday deal in spite of the holiday which was decent, service was still good, seats cleaner this time, volume just right.   On my way out, I witnessed an employee slamming doors and screaming at staff in the kitchen - this is totally not ok, nor professional. The women's bathroom happens to back on to the doors to the kitchen. Not a great last impression leaving the place.",

    "text": "Omg!! I can't believe I haven't left a review here yet! I thought I did a while ago.  I just LOVE this place! I'll even go just to dine in. It's the best movie experience ever! This place has ruined me and my family for other movie theaters - we are spoiled!  When you walk in, its like a western saloon theme. The decor is just beautifully done. You can tell a lot of thought, heart, and soul was put into this. You are greeted with a large bar, should you desire a drink well before the movie. I should add that they have a wonderful happy hour with half off drinks and munchies.  Anyway, there's another counter that you can view sweet treats/gelato (all of which is also available at your seat in the theater) and a window showcasing fancy desserts.  You make your way to your theater to your assigned seats which are these amazing, plush recliner chairs. I should say that they are more of a couple type of seating. So the menu - they have a menu with a great selection of foods and drinks from pizza to sandwiches and pasta dishes. Feel free to choose coffee or perhaps a beer or cocktail.  Appetizers come on time, before your meal, unlike other theaters (ahem, Studio Movie Grill). They always get orders correct and the food is good. The servers are excellent and attentive which is hard to find at dine in theaters (take note Studio Movie Grill).   Things I enjoy: nachos,  pulled pork sandwich, and cheeseburgers.  If you start coming here, you won't go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Our first trip to Roadhouse Cinemas last night will probably be our last:  1. When standing at the cafe waiting to order some drinks, my wife and I (and others) were completely ignored for several minutes. 2. When we finally got the barista's attention and politely asked her if we could order something before going in to our movie, she told us (in a less-than-friendly tone) that she couldn't take our orders for awhile, because they were \"backed up right now.\" 3. After we got a table in the foyer and ordered a coffee and a tea from our waiter, it took about 25 minutes for these 2 drinks to arrive. And when they did, my wife's coffee order (a basic cappuccino) turned out to be completely wrong. 4. After we moved to our movie seats and my wife found that her coffee was wrong, she highlighted it to our new waiter. He was kind enough to take it away, but the idea of offering us a refund or replacement drink never seemed to occur to him. 5. We ordered our dinner the same time as our friends and everyone around us, but 15 minutes after everyone else was eating, our meals had not yet arrived. We finally paged our waiter to ask about it, and politely asked the status of our order and when our food would be ready. He told us, \"The kitchen is really backed up tonight. I'll go get your food right now.\" Which made us wonder: \"If it's the kitchen's fault, then why does everyone around us already have their food? And how do you somehow know ours is ready to go get it right now?\" It sounded more like our waiter had just forgotten - and tried to pass the blame to someone else. This seemed even more likely when we received our food and it was no longer hot, as though it had been sitting and waiting somewhere. 6. When our food finally arrived, we found they got our order wrong. Even though you give your order in writing there, apparently they didn't pay attention, and gave my wife the wrong side. 7. The pizza I ordered was surprisingly small, and (perhaps due in part to having cooled almost to room temperature) not very good. But to be fair, my wife enjoyed the wrap she ordered, and my tea was pretty good.  Any one issue isn't a big deal, but there were so many during our one visit that we got the impression the employees had little concern about quality service or taking care of their customers. We tried to be patient and understanding and give them the benefit of the doubt, but these multiple issues really distracted from what otherwise could have been a great evening.",

    "text": "There are three movie/dinner places that I've gone to in the valley - Studio Movie Grill, Roadhouse Cinemas, and Alamo Drafthouse. I'll try to rate them by category.  PRICE (adults): SMG: $10, but you can find Groupons RH: $10 AL: $10.50, but more on weekend  SEATING: SMG: Flip up armrests but rows alternate between countertop and swing-in table. IMHO,  you want the chairs with the swing in tables. RH: By far the best. How can you beat a leather lazyboy recliner? There is also a little light that is kind of over your shoulder that is welcome so you aren't waiting to eat during bright scenes. Lol. AL: Seating is leather but is otherwise normal theater seating with flip up armrests.  FOOD: SMG: Good food and drink. RH: Good food and drink. AL: I think Alamo has the most variety of food by quite a bit. Many people are quite fond of the bottomless real-butter popcorn.  ORDERING: SMG: Press a button and it lights up. It alerts staff to tend to you. Seems to work very well and is my favorite of the three. RH: Staff just comes by every once in a while and checks on you. I don't remember any ordering mechanism. AL: You write what you want on a piece of paper and if a server sees the paper sticking up they come grab it and put your order in. I like the alternatives.  THEATER QUALITY: SMG: As it is the oldest of the three it shows its age. I was in one theater and it had a pole in front of one of the seats. Wtf? Had stadium seating. RH: I feel like the theater was the best sound and picture but this is pretty subjective and may be influenced by the nice seats. Lol. Had the lowest stadium seating grade but still plenty to not stare at someone in front of you. Overall smallest amount of seating.   AL: good to average. Had stadium seating.  I think this is the overall feeling: If you're after price,  then go to SMG If you're after good/variety of food, then go to AL. If you're after most comfortable seating or best picture then go to RH.",

Power reclining leather seats! Super cozy!  Staff comes to you with food or drinks while you relax and watch the movie.   The gelato was good, but not quite on the Frost Gelato level of flavor though....  They carry a line of Hess Brewery beers which is an Arizona brewery.   The popcorn is great and super well flavored with the bottomless bowl. However I don't know how you could eat more than 1 bowl since I didn't finish all of ours... lol...  All in all this was the first theater we have gone to in a long time and it's by far the best one so far!",

They also have a decent Gelato selection and a lot of yummy selections to choose from on their menu. I'd recommend the Chili con Carne. And for popcorn, I'd suggest the white cheddar flavor.

SEATS: yes they are plush power recliner love seat style, however my dads seat was broken and did not recline (theatre 2 seat F5).   MOVIE: Went to see a 7pm showing of Star Wars. This is a movie theatre which has in theatre dining which means you arrive early to sit in your reserved seats and order food and drinks.  This movie theatre was still being cleaned until 7:05p so so by the time someone was taking my dinner order (and my 6 other movie goers) it was 7:18 and the star wars movie had begun. The wait staff was then still taking orders for 10-15 more minutes. This was very disturbing.   FOOD: I ordered a burger and pub fries (that come with chipotle ranch), and my son ordered \"loaded fries\" with regular ranch. He got regular fries with no ranch, and I got a burger and fries with no ranch. My other attendees were missing similar items like utensils for food, or red pepper flakes for a pizza. At 8:05 the server came back and told me they were out of the fries topping because my son ordered loaded fries. I walked out of the movie and found a manager who I explained the situation to and she said she would take some $$ off our bill.  When our check came, no discount was given. We did find the manager who just said she was again sorry, she took 30% off our bill and we left swearing to never go back again.   I have been to MANY dine in luxury theaters and this has to have been the WORST movie experience.",

This Groupon was about  $20 for both tickets, 2 drinks and popcorn. I loved the reclining seats. I also loved that it's semi private, you can't see the people behind you. The popcorn is flavored - we chose the cheddar popcorn.  So delicious.  Served to you in a bowl, not disposable. Makes you feel more at home.  For our meal we chose the burgers and truffle fries.... seriously do not pass up the truffle fries. To die for!!  The menu was super reasonably priced and really good. Not hiked up like you'd expect at a theatre. I wasn't interrupted during the movie. Not even by other ppl calling a server. There's a button you press if you need service.  I also really loved the courtyard they have and decor of the theatre. Classy place and reasonably priced.",

    "text": "Easily our favorite theater to go to - ever. We love to take advantage of the $6 Tuesdays when we can, but if we go to a movie over the weekend we try to go to Roadhouse, even though we have moved further away.  Take advantage of the Groupon while you can!!   The popcorn cannot be beat, and while the service sometimes can be slow depending on how busy it is, the drinks are great, the seats are great, and the overall vibe is just awesome. The desserts are all made in house and you can't go wrong!",

Currently, they offer these specials: $6 Tickets on Tuesday's all day for everyone; $4 Senior tickets before 4 pm, Monday through Friday; and they have a Groupon/Living Social coupon you could purchase that allows you to enjoy a $20 \"lunch for two\" for $13 (Choice of anything on the menu! We usually get two lunches and two drinks.) Great way to enjoy a first run movie, in a very comfortable setting, and a great lunch for $21-25, not including tip.)  And they also have great desserts crafted by their dessert chef, and 4 kinds of popcorn with free refills: plain or with REAL butter; caramel; cheese; or jalapeno. Like I said, it's a wonderfully unique experience!",

I almost don't want to write a good review, because this place is going to get popular fast, and then we won't get our pick of seats! HUbs said the popcorn was the best he ever had. And its not regular movie popcorn. We didn't eat food, as we had already had dinner. But the drinks and popcorn are free refills... So its a bit pricier than a Harkins. We cannot wait bring the kids and try out a Tuesday $6 movie!! Or a happy hour!! Only thing that would have made this over the top luxury is if they would have included blankets like the Ipic. Otherwise, great job!!",

    "text": "Took my father (on his birthday), mother, and brother to see the new Star Wars film today. Unfortunately the service was not good. Even though we arrived at 10:30 and placed our orders while the theater was still mostly empty, our food didn't come out until well after the movie had already started at 11:10. And then they only brought 3 of the 4 dishes out, and none of our drinks. We had to hit the call button twice before we finally got our complete order. Our server Brandy was great but clearly stressed as it appeared they didn't have enough people working with her. I requested a refill of my mixed bowl of popcorn halfway through the film and got a cold bowl of only one of the flavors 25 minutes later. I would have expected to see a manager checking the theater or apologizing for the service but never saw one. Picture wise, the image on the screen was way too dark at times too, it seemed like there was nobody who had taken the time to view the film and adjust the picture prior to the viewing.  It made what should have been an enjoyable experience a bit less so. Extra surprising considering we were going to a matinee showing that was their first one of the day. It is otherwise a very nice theater though, with a nice food and drink selection. A bit overpriced, but that is perhaps to be expected.",

I get the nachos and my dad gets a burger. Let's start with the burger. It is usually good but sometimes a little dry and always overlooked so my dad orders it med rare to get medium plus. The nachos are very good, when made correctly. There is no consistency to them though. Sometimes there is a good amount of chips with enough cheese to cover them, other times there are a pathetic amount of chips and no cheese with them. Today, I got a good amount of chips and barely, I mean barely, enough cheese for 5 or 6 of those chips. They had a lite sprinkling of lettuce on them and a few jalapenos. Nachos are chips and cheese. They should have plenty of both. Lettuce and tomato and jalapeno are extras. For the love of God, get some consistency. Plenty of chips and cheese and you will be fine.",

My server, Chris Hollis, was very knowledgeable about the menu, and recommended me to try the flavors of popcorn and explained how the ordering process works.  I would also like to point out that there was an issue with my check.   The check came incorrect and was fixed however there were 2 charges on my account.  I called and spoke with management, who addressed the situation.   I believe the name was Theresa? or Brittany, the manager happily gave me some store credit so I could go back and see the purge: election year.   I used the store credit, which I had no problems obtaining at the ticket stand.  ( I was worried that I would have to explain the situation over and over and no one would know what the heck I was talking about).   This was not an issue and I made it to my movie on time with my date.  I cant wait to go back and see star trek, and Jason bourne!!!  thanks for being awesome roadhouse!  thanks again to chris hollis, and Brittany (manager).",

    "text": "The reason for the 3 stars: -TERRIBLE nachos. Picture in the menu makes it look amazing. Thing that was delivered looked like it had been sitting in a snack bar window for about a week, complete with orange, pump nacho cheese. It was laughable the difference in what the menu presented versus what showed up. I'm mad we paid $8 for them. I would have been mad had they charged me $2 for them, that's how bad they were. It also made me really gun-shy to try other food.  -One of the bar tenders tried to serve us a flat, stale beer that she had accidentally poured about 30-45 prior to us ordering. She then put it in the wine fridge to apparently serve later and tried to give it to us when we ordered. I know it's their first week, but someone pouring/selling beer should know you can't pour it and save it for later. Kinda beer 101.  -We both sat for a while with our glasses empty and even though we were two of six whole people at the bar. We had to grab their attention when we wanted second beers and needed the check.  -Lighting in the theater was too bright during the movie. Definitely coulda taken it down a few notches and the servers could have easily seen their way around.   I will try it again because: -Theater seats were very comfortable. -All beers are from local AZ breweries and who doesn't like drinking good beer while watching movies? -Popcorn was good.   I'll probably just go straight to the theater to order and I'll steer clear of the food, with the exception of their popcorn. I know they are brand new so maybe in time things will get better. Although these things are a chain so I'm not sure why the food was so laughable- not their first rodeo.",

Theaters are small with perhaps five rows of fully reclining leather chairs. Each chair has a swing in table and button for service. Order gourmet flavored popcorn and it is served in a nice bowl. Hungry and want more, they offer unlimited refills as well as refills on their large soft drinks. The quality of the picture and sound are excellent as is the comfort of the seats. Our biggest surprise was the price. Two reserved tickets $15.90. Unlimited refills of soda and popcorn served to you in your seat amounted to less than $12.00. Once you experience a movie here you will not want to go anyplace else.",

Pros: really solid happy hour prices on drinks and appetizers Super friendly and attentive staff Comfortable seating - each seat includes a tray, multiple cup holders, napkins and condiments)  Beautiful atmosphere  Free refill on popcorn and soda  Cons: the movie times listed on their website are not correct. Be careful! We were lucky and ended up being early for our movie as opposed to missing it Food is fine. We paid happy hour price but it is def not worth the full price We ordered the standard popcorn which comes with butter. The popcorn was really soggy from the butter and it kind of grossed me out a bit :/  All in all we had a nice experience. It didn't blow me out of the water like iPic did, but I found the atmosphere more comfortable than harkins camelview. Would def come back for the $6 Tuesday's.",

    "text": "Be ready to have a new favorite theater!  This place is awesome!  First to qualify we see movies all the time at least a few a month for years.  We bounced between Harkins and amc for years. Roadhouse is Az owned with two locations so you are keeping it local. They have a scratch kitchen, seat service, really nice recliner seats, full bar, gourmet popcorn (four styles) and awesome deserts made on location. We don't go anywhere else and have turned our whole group of family and friends on to the new gold standard of seeing movies. Popcorn shirt is free bottomless popcorn all year (it's like $27 vs $8 for one visit of bottomless so it's a great value if you see at least 3 movies a year, and they are funny movie quotes and comfy so i have actually worn it a few times ).  It's gourmet and four styles, my favorite is light Carmel glaze.  If i am in the mood to mix and match I'll add half white cheddar.  Another thing i really like is they don't sell tickets until the week before (except for big movies a couple weeks out sometimes) so if you want great Seats for a Friday movie date you don't need to plan months ahead for a new release. Their happy hour is great to the point of going there when we are not seeing movies. It's 3-6 half off ALL beers (like 15 local taps as it's an Az business) half off apps. Pro move see a 6pm movie and get there 15 min early.  Our favorite day is $6 Tuesday for a 6pm movie. It's our standing date night and we can have dinner drinks and a movie for like $30-40 and that's mostly because we don't order apps.  I love their western burger personally but it's all good.  Also for all the big movies we set up a Tuesday movie night with our friends once a month and 8-15 of us will go and it's a blast.  Ps wed has something lol $4-5 movies for seniors before 4, that's not us but my parents now do that.  I could go on and on so despite  how nice fashion square, i pic and other theaters have become they still are super Corp and don't have that perfect blend of luxury experience, great seats, great service, great food at a good value. Thank you for taking pride in your business we will be strong supporters for years to come!",

For the price, its a better value than Ipic at the Quarter, but I'd still pick Studio Movie Grill for the overall experience, particularly the food. I generally take my kids to see a movie and eat. The menu and quality at Road House can use some improving. It also took me over 30 minutes during one our visits along with 2 reminders to get a coffee and popcorn.",

Adult ticket was $10.  In-seat service with a call button so you don't have to flag down a server when they walk by.  We had the goat cheese appetizer and wine and both were good.  Didn't try other food but seemed everyone around us was enjoying their gourmet popcorn.  Only area that could be improved was speed of service (both at outside bar and in seat), however it was a holiday and maybe they weren't fully staffed.  Either way, will definitely return.

The dining room is a decent size and the bar has lots of choices including craft beer.  Not the biggest menu you'll find but enough variety to suit most tastes. Then you also can have all the cinema regulars like candy and popcorn.   They also serve gelato which was needed in this shopping center. I had their Tombstone burger which had great flavor but they will only cook it medium well, and not medium.  They do charge extra for fries but the fries were really good and come with a spicy dipping sauce.  One additional negative is they have ribs on the menu but when a friend ordered them he was served tiny pieces of meat and not actual ribs so the menu listing is not accurate.  If judged by their food alone I would rate it a 3, but because of their choices and the great job our waiter did taking care of us they earned the extra star.",

The team doesn't seem able to handle the whole theater leaving some with long waits or no food at all.  We got to the movie 15mins before it started, ordered 10 mins before it started, and out of the six of us only 4 had gotten food within the hour.  A waitstaff came out and asked (-after I told someone we were missing food) if we were missing food. They got their food with 40 mins left to spare. We were also given a coupon for free deserts before we ordered, and got 3 out of the 6 after 30 mins and the last three while the credits were rolling. Then they still tried to charge us after we were told we would be compensated for the food that took so long to get.   Idk, I'll probably wait awhile before trying again, see if they can get their act together and get over the grand opening hump",

I did not receive the tickets in my email but I DID get charged for the 3 tickets so I called the theater to tell them I was charged but still had not received the tickets... The woman on the phone claimed the only way they could tell was if I came to the theater and they swiped my card... They couldn't pull it up with my first or last name OR take the card over the phone to see if the card number would show up. I was upset because I didn't want to drive 40 minutes away to see that it didn't work and that we lost our seats. The next movie wasn't showing until really late. Which WAS THE WHOLE POINT I BOUGHT THEM AHEAD OF TIME because I knew it would fill up quick. So my family and I drove there anyway hoping that it worked and sure enough they said my card wasn't on file.. Once again, IT CHARGED MY ACCOUNT! They said that their website has been having glitches and that they were very sorry and to call my bank and discuss the charge.. I then spoke to a co-worker who had the EXACT same problem and still hasn't gotten her money refunded. I will NOT be returning to this theater. They need figure out how to pull up people by their first and last name, OR better yet get their website fixed... If you do go to this theater DON'T buy them through their website!!",

Their specials seem to be on point (bison lamb burger was amazing) and the truffle fries are soooo yummy. Love the idea and being able to have a margarita while enjoying my movie is never a bad thing! My boyfriend raved about the candied jalapenos in the popcorn, and we both devoured the banana dolce gelato (we should stop sharing and get our own) honestly other than that the food was slightly disappointing with pretzels being stale and chicken fingers \"rubbery\" (IMO) and the cheese pizza isn't bad...and most of the time the service seems to fit the food, slightly sub par-besides the things stated above-until we met Marisa. What a doll and made us feel so welcome sitting at the bar. She had suggestions, made great conversation and really made us feel like regulars. We are starting to come even when we aren't going to see a movie- great happy hour and reverse happy hour!! Also all movie tickets $6 Tuesday's can't beat that!!!!",

Whole experience was top notch.  Lots of little details that just seem \"well thought out\" - example.... we had an aisle seat - there is a small wall that blocks people going up and down the aisle from your peripheral vision....  Staff during the movie was super attentive on refills of soda and popcorn.  And the popcorn - so good.  And they say its the best, which, everyone says about their own popcorn, but, the flavor was awesome and it wasn't greasy or oily at all.  It was really good.

And I did love the recliner feature that allowed me to put my feet up.  However, the sound was so loud it was almost deafening.  The prices are a significant bump above our usual Harkins Theater and even Studio Movie Grill, which also has comfy seats and food service.  But the service was horrible!  A bevy of wait staff rush around before the show begins, take your credit card imprint, and promise free refills on drinks and popcorn.  However an hour into the movie we still hadn't received the popcorn we ordered.  We buzzed for our waiter, who appeared and promised popcorn, but never showed again.  My husband missed part of the movie to go out to the serving area to buy popcorn, and then when we got the bill we were charged for the popcorn we never received.  We're waiting to see if there is a problem with the credit card statement. . . .   Next time we'll save the money, skip the hassle, and see the movie.",

    "text": "This is a tricky one... overall I felt like it deserved a 3 or 3.5 star rating because the facility was kinda dirty... more like it just didn't feel clean... BUT the staff was truly amazing! Everyone was super friendly and nice and it looks like they all have fun working together. So that bumped my rating up to a 4. Their pleasantries outweighed the grimy feeling.  The ticket prices were lower than iPic or Harkins Camelview, but when you add on taxes and fees and it pretty much works out to be about the same price.   The one differentiator that I really liked with the seating was the love-seat recliners. You could lift the arm rest up and share the space, or leave it down if you don't want to snuggle. I don't know any other theater that has this kind of seating. Most of the time it's just a bunch of single recliners with bulky arm rests so you feel separated from others. So it was nice to have a little pod type thing so you could feel cozy and like you were actually sitting together.  The other feature I liked was there was a ton of space between rows. Other specialty seating theaters try to cram as many rows in as possible, but it was really nice to have that extra leg space. You didn't feel like you were sitting on top of other people.  We were in theater nine, which I think was one of the smaller rooms. Only 5 or 6 rows of seating. It's a really long room so the screen was kinda far. But the sound was really good!! Now sure if it's truly surround sound, but it was loud and I really liked that.   One of the annoying things about the room was the Exit signs were glaringly bright, very distracting. Not sure why they were green instead of red...??   We didn't end up ordering meals this time... but we had some soda and snacks. I had some of their gelato (super yummy!!!) and we shared the Carmel corn. Free refills on the popcorn and drinks!   Circling back to the cleanliness, dirty might not be the best word... it just felt used and that it hadn't been thoroughly cleaned between shows. My table top still had wet food crumbs and grease marks. So did the arm rests between seats. The bath room felt like a swamp and was just messy with toilet paper every where.   I hope they can step up the cleaning crews, then I'd be a raving fan. For now it was a alternative theater choice, but not my go-to.",

When I called the manager said no problem just come in when you are able to see the movie and I'll scan the tickets that you didn't use. I came in today to see the 2:50 Shazam and now a different manager said no I can't honor that, you will have to repay for the tickets. But I never used the tickets? Why was I told something else. I'm done I won't ever be back. We are staying with Harkins and the Alamo, never again. I used to see movies here almost once a week, buy some wine and popcorn but I'm never coming back.

    "text": "This has to be my favorite movie theaters in the Phoenix area and I've been to recently.  While i've been a fan of all the new dine in theaters that have been popping up this one has slowly become my favorite.  AMC started with a great concept at their biltmore location but the corporate machine slowly took over and everything got an overhaul which meant smaller seats, more expensive food and worse quality.  Roadhouse on the other hand has large comfortable seats, great food at reasonable prices and a great bar!  As you walk inside Roadhouse you are greeted by a huge open space with wood beams and a cabin in the woods feel with a sprawling bar and large tv's.  I've come here hours early with friends before just to hang out before the movie for food and drinks.  Their prices are not bad at all, especially if you come during happy hour when Beer, Wine, and margs are all half off.  3 bucks a beer is a great deal no matter where you go let alone in a movie theater!    Tuesday's are 6 dollar movies all day all night which makes for another great value.  They also have a large patio section with comfortable patio chairs for hanging out.  Great place when the weather is nice.    The service in the theater is pretty standard.  You push your button and they come take your order.  Burgers are great and their fries are delicious.  They even have gelato and a whole slew of other great looking desserts. I hope Roadhouse is around for a long time to come as it's the only place i really go see movies now!",

My wife especially liked the red signs available at each table that you can place in a visible holder requesting immediate service from the waitstaff.  This is the best date night dinner and a movie venue because it performs the community service of saving lives.  Instead of going out to eat and having a few drinks with dinner and driving to a movie, you can actually enjoy dinner and walk right into the movies without getting in your  car and rushing to get to the movies right after dinner.

    "text": "Let me start with the positives. On Tuesday their movies are $5. They have a happy hour that includes some of their alcoholic beverages and a few appetizers. They have 4 different flavored popcorns and if you wear their popcorn shirt you get a free large popcorn that is refillable.   Negatives though, there are only 3 items on the happy hour appetizer menu. 2 of those items are very similar. Nachos and then chips and salsa. Not a big variety. Their buttered popcorn has absolutely no flavor. Their cheddar popcorn and caramel though is good. My server completely forgot about my drink and didn't know whether or not their root beer was caffeine free or not.   The chips for the chips and salsa didn't taste salty to me, which is good if you're on a low salt diet like me. Their regular buttered popcorn didn't taste salty either - which is good for my diet but it doesn't taste good. Bring fake salt to add to their popcorn if you want. Not sure how much salt their caramel corn or cheddar one had but based on what I know about those two flavors, the cheddar probably had tons.   The seats were comfortable and their desserts looked amazing. Thought about trying their gelato. If I come back again (only if someone else picks this place, wouldn't be my first choice) I'd try one of their desserts.",

I was hesitant to go back after the flurry of recent bad reviews, but realize you cannot believe every review. You have to consider the source (look at the number of reviews and wonder if a group had a \"bad experience\" and decided that each and every one of them will post a negative review). Blah, blah, blah, I say!!  It is such an awesome experience to have a TASTY MEAL delivered to you while you watch your movie!! Our 8 year old kid calls the server a \"Butler\" not a server because you push a button next to your chair and within minutes, the server arrives!! YES, it feels like a luxury experience!! The servers have been spectacular EVERY single time!!!   I regret my last review wherein I questioned our future experience based on recent negative reviews! I will no longer consider negative reviews unless I experience it for myself!!  The only upset for me is that they no longer offer the loaded french fries!! Despite my disappointment, this is the ONLY theater we will ever go to despite the fact that we will pass a half of dozen other theaters to land here!!  The food was super hot, fresh and TASTY!!!

As for the theater itself, the theater seats are very comfortable, like big recliners with electric controls. Projection and sound were great, and the ticket prices were the same as surrounding \"normal\" theaters.  We liked it so much we went back to see another movie a couple days later, to try some other menu items. The soft pretzel was delicious! We'll definitely be back, often.

Finally after asking the sent 2 people to clean. We are still waiting and the previews start. Asked to speak with a manager who had one excuse after the next. Offered to pay for popcorn and drinks yet the bill came and the manager was nowhere to be found. Super disappointing. Enjoyed having a place like this near by. Not any more!",

In my opinion, iPic is too fancy and stuffy (and pricy!!) while Studio Movie Grill is more casual and the food is... Not good. This place is truly the best of both worlds! A fun, casual environment with fantastic food!! My one complaint is that I wasn't hungry enough to try more of the food!  One note, don't look up the show times on google because Google has them listed incorrectly!",

    "text": "Vintage western decor throughout the facility makes customers feel warm and at home. Full bar and concessions area as soon as you walk in, tickets available in store. Super comfortable recliner seats and and great leg room available!  Tonight's visit started out great, ticket sales employees were wonderful with redeeming our tickets that we purchased online. They let us know that we could order any food at concessions or at our seat once we sat down, we opted for the later.  We were greeted by a server (I think) who we could tell was new, but he had good feedback and knowledge of the menu. He brought out 3 of out 5 drinks (we only ordered soda). He said that another server would bring out the other two... But they didn't come... 15 minutes later (movie about to start) No worries, we will just hit our service button and order our food and make sure the drinks come out.  Food arrived within 20 minutes and was hot, fresh, and everyone thought it was delicious!! We definitely recommend their burgers and the RoadHouse 2 person special food platter.  Unfortunately, we kept having issues getting refills. We would hit our service button and a staff member would be there polite and proper, ready to help but once they put the drink order in, it just not showing up. Then randomly a single drink from our party would come out... At one point, my little brothers' drinks took 30 minutes to be delivered.  After the movie, Hailee (Hailey) and Erica helped us figure out what went wrong. We wanted to speak with someone who could tell us how to order or how to fix the issue of the drinks and Hailee was super sweet and helpful. She found her server manager Erica and we found out that since the theatre was super packed, they had to keep changing out the syrups for the soda. She assured us that she would get on top of the staff and make sure that the orders would be brought out together and in a quicker manner.  Overall, great place to dine and catch a flick, cool atmosphere, and a staff with GREAT customer service.  Thanks Hailey and Erica for being so understanding and helpful tonight.  - Jack (Theater 10; Seat 12; 6:00pm)",

The service is usually amazing, but we did have quite a few hiccups last night, but I think they might be training new staff. One time - I can forgive them. I just hope it doesn't become the norm.  I'm happy for them that they are so busy that they need more staff, but I'm sad for me bc I love this jewel and want it to myself. The popcorn : hubby loves the plain with butter. I love the cheese so you can do half and half. The food: I've had the burger, chicken fingers and fries, cantina bowl, nachos, and cool hand luke salad. The food is decent, but not gourmet. I'm OK with that though bc it is movie theatre after all. Their fries are really good! The drink: I hate that they have Pepsi vs coke, but they have tuscon blonde beer - love that.  For the price and experience I prefer roadhouse to ipic and all harkins.",

I can't go anymore nor can I recommend you to friends ...and it's sad.  You got lazy and skimped on service.  Our nights together have been a series of mistakes lately.  You've closed the kitchen on us right when our movie started.  My kids were not pleased.  You've lost my gift cards twice and forgot to use them to pay my bill.  You gave my wife a 1/4 full glass of wine.  You forgot my food order multiple times.  You left ADA sound on for the entire Star Wars movie.  You've forgot to clean the hallways. You skimped down the menu during the holidays as you could not handle the people coming to your theater.   It's time that I admit to myself that I can't trust you anymore.  I liked so much of what you had to offer - the food and drink selection is the best. But sadly you just can't deliver consistently.  I'm open to getting back together but you need to admit you have a problem and fix things - or I'm afraid you won't be around much longer.",

With that said...  The overall look if this theatre was well done. Western decor and a great feel. 5 stars  The cleanliness was outstanding. I have to say your competitors need to buy a ticket and watch a movie and learn from you. Spotless every time. No garbage in my cup holder or on the floor by my feet. I cant say the same with other \"luxury\" theatres. Keep up the cleaning routine at your establishment..it shows. 5 stars  The drinks.. this might be my only mild negative critique. It was a little strong and if if wasnt ..i might have ordered a second. (Mudslide)  4 stars  The food that your serving is excellent.. also your pricing is fair.  I like the spin on the popcorns. 5 stars  We will continue to drive the extra 20mins and give you business. Just keep your standards high! Thank you.",

    "text": "Probably the best movie going experience I've ever had... No joke.  The customer service, the food, the in movie service, the seats, the overall experience was top notch!  I had my first date at the pavillions movie theatres back when it was United Artists and I've seen many come and go (Regal, Ultra star, etc) Surprisingly I think Roadhouse Cinemas has it down. I hope and pray they stay.   Awesome new look! - let's face it. This place needed a new look. When I walked in I was blown away by the details, the new layout, the style and the feel. You gotta check it out especially if you were a lifelong pavillions movie goer.  The food - we ordered popcorn and it was amazing! Unlimited refills, freshly popped, real butter, spot on! That's all we got but the people next to us ordered milkshakes, French fries, sodas, entrees and more throughout the movie which all smelled and looked like they would be really good.  The service - extremely friendly, all the employees were very happy to be there and willing to help. Oh, and this is a first, as we were walking out atleast 2 staff members in the halls asked us if we needed anything else and gave us a sincere thank you for coming. Unlike most theatres were u get the 15 year old that opens the door for you at the end with the trash bucket telling you \"thanks\" like a zombie. Impeccable!  The movie seats... - this is where the \"new age\" theatres go wrong. They advertise recliners and stadium seating but you can't put your feet up in the new recliners and you are 6 feet away from your wife or girlfriend. Roadhouse nailed this one!!! - they have the best seats hands down. They are twosomes, fully recline and are super duper comfortable!!!! Way to go roadhouse!!!  The best part was the movie we went to see \"Independence Day 2\" was awful.... Horrific... Why, 20 years later, why?...  But... We had such a great time at the movie even though the movie was garbage, we are dying to go back, ha!  You gotta see this place, if your in from outa town or a local, you'll love it!",

    "text": "Decided to try out the new theatre recently on a Saturday night. We came in last minute about 10 minutes before the movie so the seat selection was very limited. We ended up in the front row but it actually wasn't too bad since the chairs recline. Our server/attendant promptly took our drink order which was just water and we had time to look over the menu. We each ordered the chicken tacos. While these were good they need to work on the corn shell. It was like they took it right out of the package so it was very tough. It needed to be heated up to soften it a bit or change it to a flour tortilla (or give the customer the option of flour or corn). Other than that they were not too bad.   The server had placed our check on our tray table before the end of the movie and he was so quite we didn't even notice! One thing they do, do is charge the debt/credit card you initally use when you purchase your ticket so be aware. Sometimes we will split a move/meals (one will buy dinner one will buy a movie) so I'm not sure how this would work here so I'd suggest asking when you purchase your ticket.   Overall the theatre was very nice and will be back.",

There are so many aspects of this theatre that are amazing, I will surely forget something, so I'm just going to bullet point them.    *Very comfortable seating (electronic recliners)  *Great theatre and elevations (the wall heights make each row feel like you are the only ones in the theatre)  *Phenomenal food and drinks with a happy hour (great pricing especially when compared to other theatres like ipic). The adult root beer float is great.  *Awesome prices. I couldn't believe the ticket prices especially after walking in this place for the first time. (Seriously compare the ticket prices to other luxury theatres).  ***The staff at this place... wow... The owner should be proud. Every single staff member we walked by told us to enjoy our movie and ALL of them bid us a good night upon leaving.  Our servers were extremely friendly while also being professional and prompt.   Do yourself a favor and give this theatre a try. You are going to love it.",

Seems like they have built a winner over here with great prices, relaxing seats and good food and service. The matinee price was only $7.95 and you select your seats and your on the way. They do charge an extra $2 online to reserve seats, but no need to waste money on that for matinee's, which in this case had only four other people present. The seats were very comfortable in full recline mode and they also have lunch specials for $7.95. Tried the Fresh turkey, bacon, green chile half sandwich and you get a side salad as well. The poppyseed dressing was great as was the real turkey and smallish lunch sandwich. Service was smooth and overall it was a nice experience for this type of business.",

I selected my tickets online and checked in at the box office and was surprised to be greeted by one of the owners, Vincent. We were given a tour of the facility including a peek into the kitchen, Vincent even took it upon himself to change our seats for optimum viewing. We ordered our food and it was delicious, Cuban sandwich, Greek salad and Angus Burger with Greek fries. The hospitality was insanely good, the facility was beautifully designed and the overall experience was fantastic! I will not spend another penny at Ipic now that this place is in business. I would highly recommend that you check it out!!! I forgot to mention that all of the theaters within have comfy leather recliners!!!  Still loving this place, now with $6.00 Tuesday's!!! We saw \"Ghostbusters\" and Victoria was our server. (She was awesome!) We split the \"Freebird\" sandwich with fries. This sandwich was so good that I would return to order it again, movie or no movie, and the spicy sauce for the fries....yummy! This place does not disappoint.",

We hadn't known of this place previously but received a gift card from the holidays so we decided to give it a try.  Well. We were not thrilled with our experience at all.   We went yesterday for the opening wknd of Logan. The movie was going along just fine and then all of a sudden the lights came on. And not just dim yellow soft lighting, but the bright blinding lights that make it hard to see the screen. Ummm there was about 20 minutes of the movie left when this happened. When we asked about this to a staff member we were told management knows about it. Well management, fix it. This is a serious problem. This was opening wknd of a highly anticipated movie.   And while the food tasted amazing (gyro, chicken tenders, beef sandwich, and cheese fries) it was over priced. $11 for a small sandwich and then another $8 for fries. I've got no problem paying for good food, but it's over priced for the quality delivered. Wait staff was nice but service was slow. Save yourself time and money and get dinner before you go.",

    "text": "As I was walking out of the theatre (with my bag of free refill to go fresh popcorn), I turned to my sister and said, \"I have to write a Yelp review about this place!\" So here I am.  I had never been here before and my sister was visiting from out of town.  She picked this place because, and I quote, \"If I'm going to watch a movie that long, my a** is going to be in a leather recliner!\"  (The movie was 2h 15 min long, which is apparently above her threshold for normal theatre chairs.)  So, off we went.  Our ticket seller was very pleasant.  We started at the popcorn counter and were immediately offered assistance.  We decided to see what our seats were like first and come back, because we weren't sure of the set up, but thought it was one of those dine-in places (which it is).  When we sat down, we were greeted by our smiling server almost immediately.  He asked if we had been there before, which we had not. \"Great!\" he exclaimed and proceeded to give us the full tutorial.  He took our drink order and let us browse the menu.  When we had finally decided, we hit our button and he was there within a minute, still smiling, and took our order of popcorn and a sweet treat.  He thanked us, hoped we enjoyed the film, and went off to put in our requests.  The popcorn was delivered the second the lights went down - perfect timing in my opinion.  A few minutes before the movie, I walk out to find the restroom.  I'm sure I had the same look everyone has on their faces when they are looking around for the restroom, and a staff member immediately (also in full smiles) asked me if I was looking for the restroom and gave me directions, and hoped I enjoyed my film.  I thanked him and went in to the large, clean restrooms.  Bonus.    The staff was courteous and efficient delivering the cheques towards the end of the film so that they were never a distraction.  Every staff member I passed leaving was in full smiles, thanked me for coming, hoped I enjoyed the film.  I was standing outside the restroom after the film, holding popcorn bowls and waiting for my sister.  Two staff members were talking.  One said, in a pleasant tone, \"let me take care of this and I'll do that\" then walked over to me, concerned, and asked if she could help me, clearly thinking I needed a manager.  I said \"Oh, no! Just waiting on my sister!\" and she smiled and said \"Oh! Okay! Thank you for coming!\"  We decided to get refills of our popcorn to go, and the staff there was just as courteous as everyone else.  It was at this point that I said I was going to have to write this review.  This is the friendliest movie theatre I have ever been to.  I have never had any complaints about the service at Harkins, (I have multiple complaints about the service at AMC).  but this place has won over my heart.  They will now have a very regular customer.",

    "text": "They got the goldie locks of margaritas. In my experience the ones at AMC desert ridge are too sour, and the ones at Studio Movie Grill are too watered, but theirs are just right. What I did not appreciate is that the sandwich I ordered took forever and then when it gets to me it was no longer at the right temperature. That means that it was most likely sitting on the counter and left there too get cold... And then they make an error on my card and get double charged. This is a problem I don't experience in any other similar theaters, but it got properly refunded, so I move on. There's definitely a lot of other food options I want to try, plus the ambiance is pretty cool as well, so I would definitely come right back.",

I'm going to the Camelback Esplanade this weekend to compare the 2, as I've heard this is similar if not the same as the Esplanade, but I like to think that this offers something way more special.   The place is super clean, service is seriously 10/10 -- we had zero issues. The service is also really fast.   Let's talk about the popcorn. My god. It's so so so good and has that perfect nutty crunchiness of freshly made kettle-style (not in flavor just texture) that you love. Comes in a giant silver bowl for $7.95 and is bottomless. You can even leave with a giant bag of it. I feel like they might change that soon since it's such a crazy good deal.  The prices of the food and beverages were good. The ticket was $13.50 so I definitely want to try to go during their happy hour.",

    "text": "This used to be my favorite movie theater in Arizona until last night. We went to dinner and a movie and my husband's wallet was stolen from the arm of his seat. We have NO DOUBT it was an employee, and we feel we know which one. We talked to the manager who talked to the employees and all said they didn't know anything about it...of course. The manager then checked the security cameras and saw nothing. Because we are not allowed to view their security camera film, he said, \"Feel free to call the police. They check our security cameras all the time.\"  All the time?  ALL THE TIME???? How often does this happen? I think quite a bit. We called the police, who were wonderful. They checked the security cameras and couldn't see anything either. Funny...dark corner of a dark theater, and the security cameras were inconclusive... While we sat in the lobby for 2 hours through all of this, we saw probably 10 people during that time come out of their theaters and complain to management that they were over-charged on their food bill. This has also happened to us on occasion. I think this place is a scam and has an underlying problem of thievery and dishonesty. We will never set foot in that theater again. I strongly warn you to stay away, but if you go, watch your belongings and CHECK YOUR BILL BEFORE PAYING!!!",

For this being one of the highest ticket prices in the valley, you really should expect great service at a level that you can't get elsewhere at a lower price. They are constantly out of something in the kitchen, it took 40 minutes on Friday night to get 1 beer delivered. If you're into using clean bathrooms, go elsewhere. Paper towels are everywhere, stalls constantly out of toilet paper with trash everywhere. Management obviously doesn't stress cleanliness. My seat on Friday was very sticky on the arm of the chair and don't bother to look at the center console it's covered in crumbs. And the majority of the staff is undertrained teenagers trying to fumble their way through the night- not their fault.   I truly do not understand why this place is able to charge premium prices for subpar service. We will not be going back after this past Friday experience after trying to give this place a shot time after time.",

It was the first dine-in movie theater I had ever been to, and now with so many other competitors in town, is still my top choice! Roadhouse seems to have larger reclining chairs, that are still easy to sit in and enjoy food / drink. I love their drink specials, always themed to the big blockbuster that opens. But most importantly, I love the locally sourced snacks and drinks. They have THE BEST white cheddar popcorn around. Honestly, I feel that the amount of food, and value, is very reasonable for their prices. Plus, isn't it so great to show up to a movie and know you have a seat reserved, where you can order a cold beer and it's brought right to you? THE BEST.",

You could probably say I am a movie theater's ideal target customer.    This weekend we purchased 3 seats together to see Spiderman.  Upon arrival the middle seat didn't work. The waiter sent the manager who arrived just as the movie started to trouble shoot.  He couldn't fix it so recommended I sit elsewhere.  Since it was the middle seat that would literally put all 3 of us sitting alone.  I don't know about you but when I go to the movie I enjoy sitting with my friends/family, not staring at the screen alone... Not to mention I'd have had to pick up all of my belongings, food, and drink to relocate while the movie was playing. The manager offered 1 free ticket (which never came).  We asked for him to just refund the tickets (keeping in mind we've racked up a $50 food/drink tab ALREADY and the show JUST started).  He said he could but said we'd have to leave...   In a world where we have PLENTY of movie theater options you'd think they'd be a LITTLE more motivated to keep their existing, frequent, customers happy when they have a shortfall.  I enjoyed the movie in my broken seat with my family - and next time we'll go to a theater where the employees smile and the managers want to keep their customers coming back. Sometimes it's the small things that make the biggest impact.",

A bowl of popcorn is around $8 with unlimited refills, but they also sells shirts for $25 that allow you to get a free bowl every time you come in for a year. You can try out the popcorn flavors beforehand, but I always love to get a trio of cheese, caramel, and jalapeno. AND they're all made fresh in hoise of course!",

The anxiety to have to do that settles in, but you can't imagine staying indoors yet another weekend night.   Then you think to yourself, \"How about a movie?!\" You want to feel like you're treating yourself so you automatically go to iPic's website to check the showings. The $27 price tag for a movie starts to sink in...\"It's not payday yet\" You say mid sigh while you begin to make peace with the fact that you're staying in.   But wait! RoadHouse Cinemas provides the comfort and access to a very similar treatment for half the price! You jump in the car (still wearing those comfy sweatpants previously stated), and head over to the next showing for that movie you were so eagerly waiting to see.   You choose your seat when buying the tickets, you settle into your leather chair, and lay all the way down with feet up to the sky. With the press of a button, you receive all the delicious carbs that fit into your relaxed-chic outfit for the night, and you lose yourself in a great experience forgetting any possible 'FOMO' (Fear Of Missing Out) you might've been feeling before.   *Disclosures:   - This was not an attack at iPic (it's definitely an amazing experience (from what I hear) and I encourage the visit).   - You have to be okay with Western/Cowboy decor.  - No, this is not a sponsored review.

It was a comfortable and fun experience for our family of 5 and not too expensive. Plus the staff was warm and patient with our kids. Definitely coming back.",

    "text": "Oh RoadHouse Cinemas, what great deals you have! Oh RoadHouse Cinemas, what comfy seats you have! Oh RoadHouse Cinemas, what tasty popcorn you have!  All the better to watch movies, my dear!  We used a Groupon for two that included unlimited popcorn to see Wonder Woman on opening night. We even sat next to someone who was dressed up for the movie complete with tiara, bracelets, and lasso!  The auditorium sizes seem on the smaller side which I really enjoy and the seats were some of the comfiest recliners I have experienced. It feels like you are in someone's fancy living room rather than at a movie theater!   We got Roadhouse's white cheddar popcorn, The Great White. The popcorn was so good I couldn't stop snacking on it! And the portion-size is HUGE! So much so, that we didn't even use the free refill option. You can also order fun movie title foods like: My Big Fat Greek Salad, Sunset Strips Chicken Tenders, Tombstone Burger and Robert Brownie Jr. Sundae.  I really enjoyed myself despite the fact that having servers during a movie can be a little distracting. They do try their best to hunch over and be polite, but I found myself pulled out of the movie once by a rather bright electronic screen one server was carrying to another audience member towards the end of the film during \"last call\".   Ideally, you are probably going to want the seats furthest away from the aisle, in the rows closer to the screen to reduce having servers walk in front of you. But keep in mind if you like to push the call-button then you are responsible for causing the servers to walk in front of other guests.   I will definitely be back to Roadhouse Cinemas again to try their $6 Tuesdays, Way Back Wednesdays (with throwback movies for only $5), and Happy Hour (M-F from 3-6pm), which all sound like a lot of fun!",

The reason I'm giving Roadhouse 3 stars is because the service is hit or miss (to the extreme). Sometimes the servers are amazing, but last time my boyfriend and I were here, he brought us the wrong popcorn flavor, plain Mac and cheese (he ordered it with bacon and pepperoni) and we waited 45 minutes for him to bring us a root beer.",

The decor of this place is super cute and the overall atmosphere is great. We got there early to eat and drink prior to the show. The bar had a awesome selection of local beer on tap- score! The bartenders were busy and service was somewhat slow but they were super friendly. The menu is full of punny names for food items. We tried the road trip for two appetizer and the cool hand Luke salad. The appetizer was nothing spectacular but I enjoy the salad.  The highlight of the food was what we had in the theater which is served by a server when you put on a service light. The popcorn was amazing. They have fun favors to mix and match. The bowl is endless but I don't think you would ever need a refill. We also tried the mint chocolate chip gelato. Yum!  The seats are assigned. (you pick the seat at time of purchase based on availability) they are good sized brown automatic recliners with a moveable tray table. Unfortunately the tray table over my seat was not movable and stuck over the seat which made it somewhat difficult to get in and out of the chair.  I would pick this place over the updated AMC and Harkins theaters because of the popcorn and cheaper alcohol prices. The future of going to the movies is swell.",

Me and my wife both got the burgers with fries. Not sure how else to describe them, but to say DAYUUM!!!! The fries were out of this world.  And that burger! Hot an juicy and full of flavor.  The only let down was the \"endless\" popcorn. the bowl they serve it in is big enough, but the kernels are REALLY small and fragile, and after a few handfuls, you have a big bowl of inedible crumbs. I like the flavor ideas they offer, but unless they switch  to a more theatre style kernel, I would stay away. Regardless, we will be back!",

We ordered margaritas which were weak, mostly mix. So we went to bar after movie & the friendly bartender made us Long Island I've Teas. I asked for top shelf hoping they'd be stronger than margaritas. Nope. They too were weak although price was not. The personnel here were nice on this day although first time the waiter was not friendly at all. Normally we go out to dinner prior to going to movies but we thought we'd take a chance on food & drink. I guess we go back to original plans.",

I came to this place for the first time due to a Groupon. 2 tickets, popcorn, and 2 beers for $21. The price is unbeatable and I will agree that it is an amazing deal.   The reason this place gets three stars is because it is still a great place to come and so far has been the best Dine-In Movie theater in Arizona I have visited, but the service here is truly lacking. Our drinks took much longer than an acceptable time to arrive. I had to press my call button to check on my drinks before they finally brought them. Server didn't really check on us unless we pressed the call button. I would've ordered more had they checked in.   The Roadtrip for two is supposed to come with two \"fully loaded quesadillas\" but what we truly got was about a half of a quesadilla to share. I understand it's happy hour, but at least be more transparent so that people know what to expect when they order.   The White Cheddar popcorn was a huge bowl of popcorn, I was pleased with it.   The restroom was decent, one out of order urinal but the urine cakes smelled like they hadn't been replaced in some time.    Overall, I will be coming back and will be recommending this place, but I hope management sees the large room for improvement here in the service of the wait staff. This place has a big potential to be five stars if their staff is held to a higher standard.",

    "text": "Really nice cinema with special Senior pricing M-F for shows before 4:00pm. It's a great option to be able to see a discounted first run movie.   Happy Hour doesn't have a lot of food, but the Munchies are half off. Pickle chips were really good. We had two snacks and two chips and the bill was $14.00.   Overall very good experience.   I've been here 2-3 times in the afternoon. If you want food you'll probably have to flag down the server in the theater.  Loved our server Donna on the patio!",

I was really disappointed in the experience tonight watching Shazam.   These guys could not get any part of our order right. I asked for waters for both of us - they didn't bother to bring mine, I had to page them and ask for it again. We both had desserts - they brought mine out (a sundae) almost ten minutes before they brought hers out (a scoop of gelato!). I asked for a refill on popcorn - they brought me the wrong kind, which turned out to be for the people a few seats down... they then handed it to them and never bothered to get me the refill.   Considering the seats are visibly numbered, I don't understand how this can consistently happen. The bill for myself and my daughter was over $40 plus the cost of the tickets, so if they want to stay open, they can't afford these types of service issues.",

I think the food could be a bit better with some healthier options like wheat bread for the sandwiches, but overall pretty good. My favorite is their burgers or their salads for a healthier option. They have really good dessert though if you feel like splurging and a wide variety of gelatos which is nice in summer.",

Here is my issue, and it's a major issue for me.. the screen video quality is a 6! The reason for this review is so the owner of Road House sees this and invests in better projectors. I know it's expensive, but do it for the people who really are videophiles.  I bet there are more of us out than you think.  I'd rather be at your theater than Harkins at Fashion Square who has video quality of a 10",

    "text": "I had not been to these cinemas since they became Roadhouse so this was a nice surprise to see what they have done to the old theatres. They have put a lot into the exterior and the decor inside. When you walk in, there is a large restaurant/ bar area which is a great idea. Our movie was just about to start so we had to head straight to our theater. There was no one around to check our tickets which makes me wonder how they keep people from just walking in without tickets.....  We went right to our comfy seats where we had a look at the menu. It is a pretty basic menu  with burgers, salads and wraps being the majority of the choices. I had noticed a sidewalk chalk board advertising two of their specials so I chose a burger from that. When our server came to take our order she informed me they were out of the burger... at 6:45? I don't get that, but I chose a buffalo chicken wrap as my second choice. The food and drinks came pretty quickly so that was nice. My wrap was okay-  nothing stellar or particularly amazing about it. It would have been nice to have a little side offered with the wrap - a small salad or fruit, but there was nothing with it.  Prices are pretty standard for bar food. Overall, I would come here again as the service and seats and sound were great. Maybe the menu could just improve and expand a bit.",

    "text": "I love theaters that allow you to reserve your seats in advance so I was excited to try Roadhouse Cinemas out. The menu looked pretty good too, and I'm all for the comfy reclining seats a lot of theaters offer these days.   I bought my tickets online and received an e-mail confirmation. We got here about 30 minutes before the movie started. Aside from the large lot at Target across the street parking seems a bit limited for a movie theater but we had no problem finding a spot near the front of the entrance.   If you buy tickets online you'll still need a physical ticket stub so we went to the front counter. You can either show them your email, printed receipt with QR code, or give them the credit card you used to pay for your ticket and they'll give you the stubs. I had also bought a ticket for my friend who was running late and said to get seated ahead of her and they were nice to hold the ticket for her at the counter.  The menu looks like it was created by Bob Belcher from Bob's Burgers. The cluck Norris, my cousin pepperoni, and Robert Brownie Jr? Hell yeah! No sign of Tina, Louise or Gene though. They also have a decent selection of vegetarian options with weekly specials to mix things up a bit. The weekly special craft burger they had when I went was a Hatch chile burger. I had it vegetarian style with the black bean burger. You also get to choose a side, I went with the fries.  The burger was pretty good. I liked the black sesame seed bun, large slab of chile in the burger and the patty tasted alright. I enjoyed the fries as well, which were lightly crispy steak fries.  Service was cheerful and friendly.  The seats are very comfy and we had no problems hearing or seeing anything in the theater. Towards the end of the movie a staff member will come by and drop off your check so you can pay before it's over.   Temperature wise it was a bit warm prior to the movie starting and it smelled a bit weird, maybe due to all the recent humidity from monsoon season. As the A/C kicked in though it felt and smelled fine.  The total per ticket was a little less than $12 with service fees. Overall it was a good experience and I'd go back here if I were in the area to see another movie.",

(Green Book is a fabulous movie by the way).  Next up, I met a friend and we took our kids to see the latest Lego movie.  And most recently, I went to a fundraiser movie event and saw the movie Isn't It Romantic.  (I love that they hosted a movie for a great cause).  Some of the reasons I say that this is my new favorite movie theater: -Convenient Location / Plenty of Parking -Locally owned  -You can choose your seats ahead of time -Roadhouse offers a full food and drink menu including a full bar -The seats are super comfortale and recline to your liking -Popcorn is fabulous and nonGMO + comes in several flavors (plain, cheese, jalapeno and perhaps caramel) -If you get there early or stay late, there is also the restaurant to hang in, gelato / coffee / other desserts, cornhole and jenga outside on the patio, etc... -Super friendly staff -Special reduced pricing on Tuesdays and before noon  I have now had the greek salad with chicken twice, and enjoyed it both times, but it is a little strange eating in the dark :)  It's something I can get used to though.  Can't wait to return soon!",

Plenty of space between you and the strangers on the other side of the extra-wide armrests. The place is impeccably clean and has a very cool decor. Think elegance meets the Wild West. Prices are very reasonable for a place this nice. It's way nicer than iPic and tickets are less than half the price. It's the way going to the movies should be.  The thing that keeps RoadHouse from five stars is the food. To say it's mediocre is putting it nicely. Not inedible, just not good. Also, the water tastes like it's directly from the tap. They certainly don't have an RO system, and I tend to doubt it's filtered at all. Tastes like crap.  Get the food and drinks right RoadHouse! It's the only thing holding you  back! I would gladly pay an extra $2 a ticket and $3 an entree for improved food and beverage offerings, and would go out to the movies far more often. It'd be a win-win for everyone.",

But when it comes down to it, you're seeing a movie and the movie quality should be amazing. We'll be back, and hopefully they'll amp up their projector/sound system.  The food: 10/10 amazing selection and quality. Blows studio move grill and harkins camelview out of the water.   Ambience: Very Alamo Drafthouse like, pretty decor, and nice flow. The bathroom doors are a bit weird to open. The seats are like the ones at the Harkins camelview. Everything is pristine, and thoughtful. The staff is super friendly, like, Dutch brothers level.   Movie: No previews which feels strange. The blacks on the projector need to be calibrated. Really dark scenes, the blacks were almost blue (theater 10). Also, the projector in general was dark, as evidence by things that should've been bright white looked dimmed or blueish. Most people probably wouldn't notice-but working as a video editor, it's something that I found distracting. The sound was quiet in volume, and is not surround sound. When you see a movie, especially an action movie, I love to experience great sound and feel the booming bass. This theater does not have that. While the screen is large and the seats are good, the general movie experience was just okay.   So to sum it up, I really really loved roadhouse cinema but was disappointed in the sound and video quality. However, with such an overly friendly awesome staff, and potential, I have no doubt that they'll end up upping their video and sound quality.",

I am literally watching a movie here right now with a friend and am so disappointed.  I have brought at least 5 different friends and family members here and can say that only 1 time did we have a nice and competent server, and an enjoyable experiences. I hope the owners of this theater take a hard look at there service standards because there are plenty of other theaters out there to choose from and this theater could really be a great place.  I forgot to mention that the theater is freezing cold. Almost unbearable.  My friend had to ask for some hot water so she could hold onto it. (Which also took until halfway thru the movie)   We were very excited for the Carmel pop corn but they are \"out\". When we asked if they would make more they told us that the white cheddar is the most popular so they were just going to make that. Seriously? We ate dinner here so we could have the Carmel corn as our dessert and they were so rude about it. I don't understand how a theatre, on a Sunday afternoon, is fully stocked on their products and then snuffs a customs off for wanting Carmel corn. So disappointed.",

We then went into the theater to sit down, and ordered popcorn, drinks, and dinner 10 minutes before the movie started. The waters came immediately, which was a blessing, because the wait for the rest was unbearable. Had to push the button to not only ask where our drinks were, but halfway through the movie, our food still wasn't there, and had to summon the server to find out where our food was. No explanation, no apology.   The place boasts of making all of their food from scratch, but I absolutely do not believe it. My wife's fish tacos were horrible, and my burger was barely edible.   The best part of this place is the popcorn. It's bottomless and delicious. The bar and the popcorn are the only reason this place even got 2 stars.",

Because we were there for 2 movies we didn't want to close out the card on file so we asked if the server would be able to follow us to the next theater. I know each server is assigned to certain theaters rooms but they were nice enough to allow this.  Very customer friendly!  But Im guessing also it was a slow day too.  I only gave 4 starts because the 2nd theater room we went into the chairs were still messy with food.  My side table was also pretty sticky.

We had called to see if we could reschedule to a different showing and the person on the phone informed us that there was nothing they could do about it and that the $30 we spent on the unused tickets was gone.   The other time we had seen The Dark Tower and the speakers in the theater were completely blown out. It was so bad that it was more distracting and annoying to watch the movie than it was worth. The popcorn we had ordered was also very stale tasting and disappointing for the price.   The seats are extremely comfortable but I prefer to take my money to Studio Movie Grill where I know I can get fresh food, properly working theater equipment, and excellent customer service.

    "text": "I want to start off by saying I have had some good experiences at this theatre, but last night was so bad that I need to tell someone. I rarely even review anywhere.   My boyfriend and another couple joined me at the bar for one of the last showings (8:45) and we got a drink while we waited. The bar tender asked if I wanted a single or a double, we assumed, like most would, that this bar offered a discounted second shot in the double. The bar tender did not tell us any different so I got a two doubles and my boyfriend had two beers. When we got our bill for $53.00 I was pretty shocked and asked if I could see the print out of how much each item costed. Another bar tender rang it up and it turns out that a double of Titos at this bar costs $21.00! Woah. So that's fine, we pay, won't ever order a double again with out asking but the bartenders explanation was \"well that's Scottsdale for you\". No, because I can walk to Buffalo Wild Wings about 200 feet away and pay $11.00 for a double of the same alcohol! Or I could go to the grocery store and buy a bottle for the same price as a double here. But to make it worse the bartender at this theatre free poured the drinks, holding for only maybe 3 seconds, which is not going to be 3 ounces of alcohol. So we were short changed to be certain, buyer and drinkers beware.  Now to the movie, where we were never greeted by our server and had to call to get a refill and put our order in. Took about 10 minutes for her to come, and once we put everything in it took another 15-20 minutes for our drinks to come. The food was fine, no complaints. But, the drink I ordered was not very good so when someone with a very long pony tail came to drop off our food (the call button had been pressed for another 10 minutes) My boyfriend asked him if I could get a different drink and his response was \"you'll have to ask your server bro\" and walked away. Sick. There was all of our dirty glasses and dishes sitting everywhere, I think he could of at least bussed a little. Well when the waitress finally came, I asked if I could just get some lemon for my water and that I did not want my drink or even a different one at this point (didn't even ask if I did want something different anyway, just walked away). Well shocker, the lemons never came! All in all we paid about $150 (including the four tickets we bought for our friends) and I had nothing but bad things to say when walking out. Needless to say our friends had an identical experience. Don't know if we will be back and boy did we look like idiots for recommending this place when taking out our friends. Thanks.",

The food is really good too. Not too shi-shi like the Ipic, but way better than other theaters, on par (price and quality wise) with most family style restaurants.  Come early (or stay later) to hang out at the bar in the lobby. Mike pours a good drink, is helpful and friendly, and good company to chat with while you wait. I feel a little sorry for him though. I watch the tickets come in for drinks, he makes them asap, and then they die on the counter waiting for the short-handed staff to deliver them to people in the theater whom I can only assume are wasting away from thirst! Word to the wise: order your drinks early or just go out and get them directly from the bar. Another recommendation, order the grapefruit Mule and tell Mike the lady with the blond and blue hair said hi!",

Finally our server came and my friend kindly reminded her that she was still waiting for her drink and the server let her know that they were out . Seriously?

    "text": "This place is AWESOME!  We took advantage of the groupon which included 2 movie tickets, two beers, and a unlimited refill of their popcorn. Great deal when we looked into it. Basically all we paid for were the movie tickets themselves.  When we got there we were actually really hungry so we ended up getting some of their food items as well. Usually at these dine in theater options the food is pretty much over priced glorified concession food. Not here, their food is actually good! My boyfriend got a burger and it was quite tasty. I had the chicken tenders, they were dry but there was actual chicken in them and a good chicken to breading ratio-i'd eat them again.  For their popcorn they have a few different options and they even let you do half and half! The popcorn comes to you in a giant metal bowl. The staff was great. All very very very kind and friendly, probably the best service i've ever had at any theater of any kind and better than some restaurants.  Everything was also really clean and tidy, very well taken care of and well maintained. Overall GREAT experience and we will absolutely be back even without a groupon.",

Normally not a fan of movie theater food because it's super expensive and the quality is below par but this was very good and very affordable. Craft beers from local breweries, non GMO popcorn with several flavors to choose from. $6 movies on Tuesdays and happy hour Mon-Fri 3-6pm. We will definitely be back!!",

The only issue is on both visits, upon 2nd order in the theatre, the waiter/waitress didn't put our order in & it was never delivered. They should really assign a couple of people to each theatre so the service is consistent. Until they do that, just go out and get your food/drinks yourself. It will save time and a headache.",

    "text": "Downgrading my previous rating because Roadhouse can't seem to stock their full menu.  They seem to repeatedly be \"out of stock\" on multiple items from their menu.  They either need to update their menu removing items or fully stock their kitchen so that they can deliver on the menu as promised.  Also know they tend to keep the theater quite cold inside.  When it is 110 degrees outside this is great, but when it is 50 degrees outside it is uncalled for.  Complaints to wait staff about the temperature are ignored.  Similarly, some theaters at Roadhouse have the sound system turned up too loud.  The wait staff won't look into this when complaints are lodged.  I enjoy surround sound and movie sound effects as much as anyone, so for me to complain about this means the sound levels are at least 10dB above where they should be for  a proper movie experience.",

I was also told by a kid on the phone they have an app that is more updated than the website, but I did not find an app on the apple App Store. I do recommend this theater over other dine in theaters, but they need to fix their website and step up the customer service.",

I will split this into two reviews...movie experience and food experience.  First the good..I would love to have this type of theater near us at home. Great seats,good sound,fantastic popcorn and the concept of getting food delivered to your seat is amazing. Now the bad..the food definitely does not live up to the standards it should at the prices charged. Our daughter ordered a pizza..just nasty. .my wife and I got salads..very basic and the chicken was almost nonexistent.  Also the food was delivered almost 45 mins after ordered. The movie was half over. If they upgrade the food it would definitely make it worth while. Maybe stick to drinks,popcorn and a movie in a comfortable environment.",

But our dinner experience deserves much less accolades. We didn't get our order for what seemed like a very long time, and when it did arrive our meals were at best luke warm. The chicken strips were described as being dipped in a beer batter. They were breaded. Not the end of the world, but they were overcooked and tough. The fries have been great in the past, but served cool are not. The Funguy pizza we ordered was served cool, and not enjoyable. In addition the bowl dinner we ordered was do-able; again luke warm.  I'm not sure who's job it is to deliver the entrees, so maybe there was some confusion with our delivery in a timely manner. But for the 120 dollar price tag for dinner and movie for 3 ( inclusive of 3 alcohol beverages) I really don't think it was worth it. (not inclusive of the 20 dollar tip)",

A week later, I went to a late night showing of Arrival, (saw the times online) only to have someone behind the bar tell me and a couple in front of me that they weren't showing anymore movies that night. Not sure what the mishap was all about but it's right down the street from me so it wasn't really out of my way. I'm keeping it 4 stars because I had a good experience but heads up to management- times online need to mirror times in the theater box office. Thats a bad yelp review waiting to happen folks",

Their multi-page full-color menu was replaced with a single laminated sheet. However, a discussion with Manager Josh yielded little resolve, other than he was apologetic and professional.

    "text": "Although I have not actually eaten a full meal here, I'm going to award my movie-going experience with the coveted 5th star.  I'm actually hesitant to write a review for fear everyone will know what I know, and I'll have to start buying tickets online and dealing with that nonsense.  But then again, if no one goes, I'll be out of luck in 6 months.  So what do I love?  1. Ticket prices are a very reasonable $12.50 for evening showings, and I believe they are $9.95 for weekdays.  Compare this to the new Harkins at Fashion Square which is a far less desirable theater in my opinion, yet is substantially more expensive. 2.  Popcorn is served in a bowl with butter, not butter flavoring.  Only one price $7 ($8 for specialty) and it's all you can eat.  In fact, you can bring your bowl back at the end and they will give you a giant bag to take home.  And I am not kidding when I say giant. 3.  Comfortable recliners and all seating is love seats (a pair with a moveable arm rest between them). And the pair next to you is spaced appropriately.  No shared cup holders.  You don't feel like you're lying in bed next to a stranger (again, Harkins missed this).  And the theaters are relatively small. 4.  Back to the food, or the drinks.  $3.95 for standard fountain drinks of 32-oz with unlimited refills. But I'm a fan of the keg root beer for $4.95 which includes only one refill, but is more than plenty.  And yes, never fear drunkards, a full bar is available. 5.  Other fun snacks like gelato creations, gourmet candies, soft pretzels (think pub, not kiosk), not to mention full blown meals.  And speaking of meals.  If you don't want to eat in your seat, the lobby has service and seating as does the patio.  What don't I love?  The popcorn is a double-edged sword.  I don't always get it because I know I will feel I must eat $7 worth.  I would LOVE if they offered a single serving option.  Take a couple bucks off and give me no refills.  Use a different colored bowl or a bag.  Something.  Don't make me sad that I have to say no.",

Couldn't even enjoy the movie because of it. I asked the server is maybe he could warm things up a little bit and he said he'll ask. I think he did because the air cut off but didn't last too long. Had to put a piece of a napkin in my ear to block the draft. This has been my go to theatre for the past year with my boyfriend. If I return.....I'll be sure to bring a blanket.",

We're over 55 so when we go on Wednesday's before 4pm, our tickets are $4 each; cheaper than any other theater in town.  The plush recliners, wait staff available to bring you anything you want during the movie, great food and drinks, and lots of space between seats are just some of the reasons we keep coming back.  Roadhouse Cinema is a great entertainment experience!",

    "text": "I recently had the opportunity to see two movies at Roadhouse in the last month. I am a regular at Studio Movie Grill, and have been to Ipic three or four times. This is all I have to compare this place and was expecting something fairly similar in experience. Neither experience has been good.  My first experience I pre-purchased tickets on my phone. When I arrived, it looked like a nice place, but other than the group of 6-7 employees all huddled around each other chit-chatting, there was nobody there to take our tickets or guide us to the theater. We arrived 30 minutes before the movie to order food, pressed our button and waited almost 20 minutes before anyone came in to take our order. Additionally, the air conditioning seemed to be broken, and it was extremely hot. While some might say the big leather chairs that recline are comfortable, I was not. They sit very straight up when not reclined and when you are eating, it wasn't comfortable. The food we ordered was below average, not something I would eat even for the convenience. I would prefer the inconvenience of going to eat before or after if I had known the food was so poor.  Despite this, I decided to give the place another chance.  Once again, no employees checked our tickets and we had to wander to find our movie. We were able to order sooner, however this time our food didn't come out until 1015 minutes before the movie was over. Again, the food was not good. Apparently they fixed the AC, but this time it was like a freezer in there and I mentioned it to the theater, they did nothing. It was probably 50 degrees in there.   I would say, skip this place for a movie. The employees are terrible, the service is terrible, and the food is terrible. I can watch a movie anywhere.  With all of the competition out there, I would guess this place is losing it's shirt and will be out of business fairly soon.",

    "text": "Ever dreamed of having your own reclining chair with a giant screen to watch your all time favorite super hero going across the screen, well, this place made my dream come True *sparkles*  This is a luxury dine in movie theater and out of all the ones i have been to across the valley, the food and chairs is all I care about.  All you gotta do is go online, reserve your favorite seats, come in abouttttt 10-15 minutes early. The server will greet you and you can flip through your menu or buzz them later... I always get their caramel popcorn (I like their jalapeno ones too) and then once the movie starts I recline the plushy chair back and I'm all settled in with my blankie.   The floor is carpet so you hardly hear any noise of people running up and down the aisle trying to take orders or leave for bathrooms. They're pretty fast on delivering your food. And the staff are always friendly and very quick to get the job done. You don't see people in front of you nor behind you.   Food is actually really good. I love their truffle fries and chicken tenders. My little brother loves their root beer float and pizzas. While the boyfriend loves their nachos and burgers. They haven't failed our tastebuds!  Overall, I believe the price is well worth it as you can reserve your seats without having to worry about where you'll be. No people kicking your chair. You're in a luxury plush reclining chair. The food is pretty good. The sound system is epic. And you don't have to worry about carrying your food and spilling your popcorn along the way. :)",

On the way home-hubby says I think we may have been overcharged. I called on my cell on the way home to talk with someone about it and was told we would need to drive back to have someone review our charges-\"it's policy!\" We live in Peoria so I asked to have a Mgr call me back. No call several days later, called and asked for GM, waited on hold 5 min and was told Azra would call me back. That was May 28th-still waiting.   In this day/age and people working hard for their money-lack of decent service and responding to concerns is a huge issue. It costs nothing to listen and hear feedback, lack of will cost plenty.",

Overall very rude service by Sara, everyone else is very nice and welcoming. By the way my friends and i who are all 18 we're going to see the PG movie 'Incredibles 2'.

I sat waiting for my daughter in the restroom and watched half a dozen employees walk by trash on the floor without picking it up. They stood and chatted, but didn't seem to care about cleaning.   Our seats had popcorn on them and my table had a sticky spilled substance on it.  We went to a Saturday matinee. I can't imagine what this placed looked like before the saturday evening rush.   While the servers were super friendly, the actual service was off. We finished our food before we received our drinks.  Didn't receive out popcorn until half way thru the movie.   Black bean burger and iced tea were great. Enjoyed the flavor of the popcorn, it was fresh.  But, it was overshadowed by a business that was dirty. It was kind of scary eating food in the dark wondering how filthy the kitchen was...",

All seats are recliners with a tray, Reserved seats, not too many seats total in the theatre. Our theatre had 5 rows of maybe 8 to 10 seats per row.  We ordered the Fish and Chips, Deep Dish Pizza called the Predator and the other the Rocky. The Fish and Chips came with about four small strip and average amount of fries. The pizzettes were filled with items but almost reminded me of a frozen totinos pizza. It was not bad but I have have better.  Would suggest purchasing a Groupon or getting the gift card at Costco $79 for $100 worth of food and snacks.  I liked the theatre and the seats that recline, the food was okay with a wide variety, would suggest shrinking down the menu and improving the quality of the food.  I liked the snack bar and the bar that was offered.   Our service was slow getting the food, but still received the popcorn quickly which almost made us full before we received the meals.  The Groupon has a couple different selections, one with drinks and popcorn and one with just popcorn, the website says they offer endless refills of popcorn with full purchase, not sure if that is with the Groupon purchase.   Would say the theatre and seats are superior to most dinner theatres, but the food quality is lacking.  Had a good time and will be back only with a Groupon and or the Gift Card from Costco.",

We were greeted by the girls selling tickets and suggested another time frame for better seating, yessss! So we sit at the bar where Bryce and Zac serve our drinks and were both beyond welcoming! Not only did they go out of their way to pop jokes and pour us good drinks, Bryce went out of his way to grab our popcorn and get us ready for our movie.  Now after finishing the movie, we are right back at the bar enjoying great cocktails and an awesome bartender, Bryce! Thank you so much, I freaking love this place and I will 100% be back!!!!",

    "text": "Lets start with cleanliness. This place never even feels remotely clean. Whether its the seats in the theater or the nasty bathrooms. It makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like.  The food I can't say i have tried much but last time I tried to order a dessert, basically all the options on the menu were not actually available that evening. However the best was my last visit where I decided to order some Gummy Bears. We all know candy at any theater is a rip off but this was well lets say a surprising experience. So my gummy bears show up and all I can say is I wish I took a picture. They literally handed me a ziplock bag with some Gummy Bears in it. The bag didn't even look like a new ziplock bag like there is a possibility the reuse the bags.. LOL. I mean I was expecting a package of some obscure brand perhaps of Gummy Bears but a handful of Gummy Bears in a ziplock is laughable to try to pass off.   The other funny experience was sitting through the same set of previews twice for some reason. Like we sat through 20 minutes of previews only for them to start over and replay again before the movie started.   They really need to get things together at this place. Its a convenient location and the pricing is fair for a movie these days but this feels more like a dollar movie experience and often the crowd in there reflects the same.",

The bar has a nice selection of craft beer, wine and spirits.  I chose my seat and walked down the long hallway to my theatre.  Most of the seating is set up for couples with armrests that fold up or down.  The thing I like the most about the leather seats is that even fully reclined there is plenty of room for the servers or other guests to walk in front of you.  However, good forbid you have to use the restroom during the movie.  Depending on what theatre you're in, it can be a looooong walk down and back.",

    "text": "Can't believe I have more negative to say about this place. I decided to give it another chance after a terribly bad experience (see my previous review and no one even attempting to resolve it privately after my last review and Private comment card). I took my sister, nephew and daughter here for a midday movie while family was in town to give it another shot. My sister ordered a salad and after taking a few bites she realized that there was plastic pieces in her salad and she had already swallowed a piece. After virtually no sense of urgency by staff or management, she ended up in the emergency room for hours while they tried to figure out the damage to her throat. We left a card for management to call me to follow up on this and my last experience, and the general manager never called back to discuss the experience after gathering some info only for insurance purposes (after specifically, and respectfully requesting a call back). No attempt to improve our situation, no apology, no offer of a gift card, no attempt to prove to us we had just an isolated bad experience, and no call back or attempt to reach us in any manner.   Terrible, terrible place. Please...avoid this place at all cost, for your own safety even! This after it used to be my favorite movie theater in town. It is now a dump with very, very poor management.",

Okay so idk if their ac is going out or they just dont want a pricey electric bill but it was SO humid and warm! It felt at least 80 throughout the lobby of the theatre and worse in the auditorium. So obviously there was a gross smell about the place. Along with odor it was obvious their menus hadnt been cleaned in our theatre.   The service was nice but the food came out slow and cold.  I was only given a total of 6 fries with my burger and refills of warm drinks were never delivered, after requesting them twice.  We wont be returning, I'm upset we wasted $70 on such a poorly run theatre.  There are other dine-in theatres with better food that dont require you to sit in sweaty leather chairs with sticky menus.",

    "text": "Here is a littlle background on me before I begin writing one of the WORST Yelp reviews I have ever wasted my personal time on.  I have been going to RoadHouse the last year pretty consistently on Tuesday nights my normal routine is to go alone --my personal--get away from the world and relax time with my movie and my wild cherry pepsi. I have gone alone and taken friends and own a tourism business in which we recommend our guests this fun, efficient experience for a date night or a cool way to see a kids movie with kids. I would like to believe I have spent lots of time and money at this establishment. I also own and operate a high stress business.  Last night my friend and I went to catch a Tuesday night 745 pm showing of Oceans 8. When we arrived we decided to have a beer at the bar in the lobby before finding the seats we picked in Theater 11. We settled in the theater --next to another couple.  We were back row right next to the wall.  A server-African American (That is the best I can do to be politically correct ) came up and asked us what we wanted. We ordered mac and cheese with bacon/chicken and also Nachos Libre.   The movie started and I watched servers in and out bringing patrons popcorn -drinks etc.   Let me start by saying this ==25 minutes into the movie the gentlemen to my left was out cold snoring and breathing heavy and his girl that was there was doing NOTHING about it--super loud and very annoying.   After an hour and 10 minutes went by and we had not received our food yet--nor had not seen a server since 15 minutes into the movie--I got up and walked out to ask where our food is--after all she had swiped my credit card and I was under the impression we had paid. I walked up to the area in which they have soda etc--in the hall way. There were 4 employees --I would say goofing off and it felt like none of them really cared too much about their job let alone customer service. I was finally after about 3 minutes asked by a african american guy--\"What's up can I help you?\"  I told him we had not had our food yet and we had been watiing now over an hour and 15 minutes and I had been missing the movie standing there talking to him--which was also annoying considering you go to Road House to watch a movie and have service brought to you--after all isn't that the concept? He responded to me with this exactly \"WHHHHHHHHHaaaaat girl that's messed up--I will check on it for you.\"  I was really honestly sincerely appauled--as this was totally not appropriate in this scenario..I went back in the theater and about 15 more minutes walked by and the next thing you know our server comes up and says \"Did you get your food yet?\" I said \"No\" She actually said \"Are you sure?\"   After she walked away--I decided to get up and go ask for a manager. Can you blame me. So--now we have this snoring man --totally rude and disrespectful--and we are now 1 hour and 30 minutes into a movie no dinner --our water glasses are dry and I have personally wasted abour 15 minutes outside the movie dealing with the issues that make the movie theater what it should be--efficient and customer service oriented.  One of the young guys got on a radio to call the manager--it took about 8 minutes for the manager to approach me. I was already done with this whole thing.  I cannot remember her name--little --curly hair --light skin -asked me \"What is the problem?  I went into a few things --our dinner was one and the man snoring was the other. She asked me what I wanted her to do. To be honest I had no idea. Her and her co manager, JUNIOR -who was super rude, full of attitude, thought he was all that, and extremely passive aggressive and did I mention SUPER RUDE. Let me say it multiple TIMES--SUPER RUDE--SUPER RUDE--started in with his hand waving in my face --not manager material unprofessional ridiculous mannerisms.  They told me they were going to go into the theater and wake the man up becuase it was totally against theater policy for people to fall asleep and I was being disturbed.  I guess that was appropriate--but why would you walk in and start a scene --the way she spoke to me was like a bitch. I told her so. She was ACTING like a B*T&* .Totally rude in her solution. I asked for my money back both for dinner and the movie in which JUNIOR basically told me I was not worthy of after referring to his employee as acting like she was and now they both were. I was calm and kept even. Instead of giving me my money back--for food we DID NOT receive and also comping our tickets back JUNIOR actually argued with me--instead of doing the right thing and trying to keep the customer he made me now want to tell every single person I deal with in my industry--which is a lot of high end high level tourism and hospitiality based people how TERRIBLE Road House is.   After wasting now close to 20 minutes of my time he refunded my credit card-made sure to tell me his boss would not want to listen to me and never come back again. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!",

    "text": "July 8, 2018 I have raved about this place to my family...and finally able to haul over to Scottsdale for an anniversary treat.   The pros - nice and airy restaurant. Like the last two visits...spick and span. Very neat and clean both in the restaurant and the theatre. The seats very comfortable. It was nice to not have the sound blasted and the movie was clear.  The cons - it took quite some time for someone to come and get our drink order. Our waitress Kate, told us she would be back to get our order. So...we waited, and waited, and waited. Finally began to turn off and on the service button. And the lights go down...and we miss the first few minutes of the movie because she decides to come at that time to finally take our order. She's pleasant...but I still don't really want to carry on a conversation at the beginning of a movie. So...we'll rent it and see what the heck the beginning was.  So...we wait and wait and wait and 22 minutes later (after waiting for 17 minutes to place our order), I go down to see where our Nachos are. Our waitress responds \"you haven't gotten anything?\"... Nope...nada...and shared this is really bad customer service. She goes in...I wait...and she comes out saying it's being plated. I inform her I want the nachos off the order.  All food comes out at once. We didn't eat the darned nachos. My husband's burger - B+ (per Roadhouse the meat temp can't be varied), my chicken sandwich B- (soggy bun and somewhat tasteless) and my daughter's sandwich a A-. Margarita A+.   The bill comes - nachos on. Movie ends...and the manager decides to give me a lecture about how I'm wrong. First \"it was 22 minutes from order to delivery\"...he didn't count how long it took for the order to be taken and my need to come check. Second he tells me we didn't ask for the nachos to come out ahead. I did. Normally who cares. But he was so amazingly rude and condescending he rung my bell. It escalated from there. He passive-aggressively had to check to make sure we hadn't eaten any of the nachos and made us wait more. He ensured I realized he was doing me a huge favor. He told me I was aggressive with his staff - nope...just more and more assertive with him. He threatened to call the police when I told him to hurry up.   This is my 3rd time there - first 2 times awesome. Being lectured and spoken down to...this will be my last. A simple apology and we would have been back. They've lost this family's business.  I'll be curious to see if anything is done about this.  On Yelp as well. Letting friends and family know too.",

The seating is a comfortable recliner and perfect for date night. Honestly the only thing I would critique would be the servers and how often they forget things or get items out to the customers.",

When you first walk in there's a restaurant for their full menu, drinks at the bar, four flavors of popcorn (regular, white cheddar, caramel, jalepeno), desserts, or gelato. Inside the theatre the menu service has always been smooth and not interrupted the movie. The car show in the parking lot on weekends is a bonus. Be sure to bring a jacket because it's pretty cold inside.",

We showed the woman the fandango showing. She torted in a snarky rude manner, \"You should've gone to the Roadhouse website. We're not affiliated with Fandango\". I told her that didn't even make sense and but everyone uses Fandango, she interrupted me saying, \"Not everyone.\"  I stated ALOT of people use it and she said \"Maybe you should call Fandango\". I was like \"Wow\"!  So rude!!! I'll NEVER go there again. So rude... wow.",

If you have any interest in actually seeing the show, I'd find an alternative cinema elsewhere that really cares about the \"movie experience\".",

I was charged a $3 service charge and then Roadhouse billed me twice for the same seats. When I arrived at the theater I spoke with the manager Haley and was told she could do nothing about it. I would have to take it up with corporate. I emailed them as instructed and did not hear back. I called my bank this morning to cancel the second transaction. This is a lot of extra work. My suggestion is don't use the website. I was told by the manager that it happens frequently. Very disappointed.",

It took till 8:20pm to get our food after my husband had to ask 2 times when they thought we would be getting our food, as we watched other people get food & drinks that had shown up a while after us or even as the movie was starting. Drinks took 30/40 mins to even show up. Then after the movie we had to hunt down the waiter to even pay our bill. Over all it seems like this place won't last long as they could careless to make things right. Wrote them on the company website & got no response from them so I am posting here to warn people. Going to McDonalds or any other restaurant we would have gotten better service & probably hot food. Completely ruined our date night! As a mom these are rare so it makes it even harder that this experience was so poor.",

We had to ask three times where our popcorn and drinks were then was told they threw away the popcorn because it was so late.  We were first to arrive, first to order and last to be served.  I have recommended Roadhouse to several people plus go at least three or four times a month, possibly more yet the last few times the customer service has been horrible.  Food coming out and finished before even getting drinks, waiting in line to get tickets while employees are just standing there watching you wait since it's \"not their job,\" employees talking and laughing about customers, having to wait over 15 minutes after call button was on just to wait another 15 on a slow night to get a water....... With more and more places changing to the same concept, it is going to be difficult to keep customers with this continued service.  I'm not sure if it's worth going back although it is comfortable and when we do get popcorn, it is the best!!",

    "text": "We've come here a few times and had a great experience. Today, not so much. I purchased tickets earlier this week for Despicable Me 3 knowing I could reserve seats for a new movie. I never received my email with my ticket confirmation. Not a huge deal as they could check me in with my debit card.   We ordered sodas and the caramel popcorn. (Popcorn is unlimited.)  Our drinks came and everyone around us is getting their meals, but still no popcorn for us. The movie has already started and we were in our seats 15 minutes before showtime. I pushed the call button and asked our server Garrett. He said they are out of the caramel popcorn and are making more. In the meantime he will bring us some other popcorn, what kind would I like. I say buttered. Then out comes some old burned caramel popcorn with tons of kernels in it. Shortly after comes a bowl of white popcorn (no butter). The kids inhale the caramel popcorn since it's a 5:15 show and we haven't had dinner. By the time the bowl starts getting low I asked for the popcorn refill. It never came. After a good while I hit the button to check on it. Garrett said it will be out in 8 minutes. Again lots of time passes and nothing. I push the button again. Another server comes and says he will check into it would I like another flavor if they're out? He heard they're making more. I said I heard that when the movie started, I don't want another flavor. Still nothing. At this point the movie is almost over. Garrett comes to bring our check and says he's sorry and will give us a popcorn voucher. Never did.   We ended up not leaving a tip and I NEVER do that. What was so hard? It was an entire movie and we never got a refill and what we got from the start was gross. Why even charge us for the popcorn?  It was $7.95 which is completely reasonable with refills. I just couldn't take all the excuses. No updates on anything unless I pushed the button and initiated it. Kind of ridiculous.   The movie was great, the seats are great, the service was lacking. It's a pretty decent drive for us, I don't think we'll bother anymore. Just hit the AMC at Desert Ridge instead.",

We go every Friday night with another couple and it looks like we might need to try another place. It's a shame because the food quality is good, the theaters are nice and the chairs are super comfy.

The theatre seats are big and super comfy and recline. The new swinging trays make enjoying your dinner and drinks easy.  We enjoyed ice cold beer (they have a nice selection of craft beer) and split a sandwich so that we would have room for popcorn. They serve popcorn in a bowl instead of a bag so you have the feeling that you are at home watching a movie.   All food and beverage service is done right at your seat.

I got a Cuban sandwich and it was was delicious made fresh, my husband got a Ghostbusters burger and it was to die for nice and juicy meat with a spicy flavor. I would go again and recommend you try it as well.",

    "text": "Can I say that this was the best movie experience I have ever had.  The theatre we were in was small - perhaps 32 - 40 seats in total.  The fact that the chairs fully recline is just amazing.  While we only ordered popcorn, and some drinks, the menu appears to offer a wide range of options at reasonable prices.  The movie ticket prices were on average $12 and included a $1 processing fee to execute an online reservation.  My only issue for improvement is that my coffee was cold when served.  The theatre seemed to be a bit empty on Saturday night so I worry about the ability to survive.  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Went here with my friends yesterday. WOW! I'm not a fan of dine in cinemas as my experiences with places like Studio Movie Grill haven't been the best. So we went on $6 Tuesdays (awesome!) but we got stuck in traffic and I was thinking the $6 program would end at 6 PM as other theaters have matinee showings and the tickets go up in price. Nope! $6 for a movie at 8 PM! So far so good, went into the theater and sat down. The chairs were leather and reclined with the push of a button. They also had trays that swiveled for your food right over the chairs. The ones at SMG have tables and it's just not relaxing while watching a movie. This was different. I ordered their soft pretzel twists with cheese dip and a chocolate shake, the healthiest thing ever of course, and the server got it out to me super fast and they were very friendly! I pushed the recliner back and drank my shake as I watched Annabelle. The surround sound in these theaters is fantastic! Almost like something out of Universal Studios. It sounded like I was actually there! Gave a lot more effect to the movie itself. Overall, LOVE this theater. Food was moderately priced and the $6 Ticket Tuesday is just great! Will return to this movie theater!",

The service is great, and when you ask for a drink, it's a big cup, so you gets lots of it. Their popcorn is healthy, and delicious. Don't eat too much of the popcorn though, because my daughter and I did, and we went out to eat, and we could barely eat because our stomachs hurt from eating too much.",

    "text": "We usually go to Harkins Camelview but thought we would give this place a try. Strongly regretting it. The staff is incredibly slow and rude. Ordered a second drink about 45 mins into the movie.... it literally took over 45 minutes to get a second gin and tonic, the simplest drink to make. AND my boyfriend left the theater after half an hour to check on our drinks. They were not busy. After the movie he went to speak with a manager about how slow the drinks were. Went back into the theater thinking I was still there to get me and overheard the staff literally mocking him for checking on our incredibly slow drinks. I didn't even finish my last drink because I got it about 10 minutes before the movie was over. We won't be returning here (even though the manager gave us free movie tickets I don't even think it's worth that to come back here and get no service and to be made fun of) ... no thank you.",

Saw some other food coming out looked awesome. My only disappointment was the lack of knowledge from the bartender. Very sweet guy, good host. Love it!!!!",
