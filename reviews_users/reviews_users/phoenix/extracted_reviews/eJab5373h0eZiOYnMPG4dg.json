Also, I wish they offered a bit more selection.  I've teetering between a 3 and 4 star but because of the reasonable price and friendly service, I'm bumping up to a 4 star.  I'll have to go again to make a final decision.   See ya there!",

The first time was a long time ago and I remember the food was good, the staff as being a bit rude and the restaurant itself was a bit warm inside.  Last night was wonderful all the way around.  Upon entry we were warmly greeted, exchanged pleasantries and were promptly seated. We got our waters and bread quite quickly and our orders were taken shortly there after. I got the chicken tikka and my partner got the lamb vindaloo we shared some garlic naan. The dining room was not crowded as it was only about 45 minutes to closing time. We received our food in an average amount of time and it was TOTALLY delicious, the portions were large and I have NOTHING negative to say about my most recent visit. In fact it will become a regular in my restaurant rotation due to its incredibly convenient location. Don't pass this place up.",

I prefer going during lunch for the buffet...which is a rarity for me, since I typically loathe buffets. But this restaurant's buffet is packed full of flavorful choices; from the chicken to the vegetable or potato pakoras.   On the dinner menu, my first choice is the chicken vindaloo. Just superb.   On a side note, you should check out their music videos playing on the two tv screens. (Again, this is against the grain for me, since I usually loathe and rant about any restaurant with tv!) Sometimes the videos are so lurid that they're addicting to watch! They're all the same with the same theme: Man falls in love with girl. Girl dances and acts coy. Man sings to woo her. Man gets girl. The end. lol  Flavors of India is a gem. Lunch or dinner, this is the place to go.",

Honestly, the food we had was amazing. I was upset I got full because I wanted to keep eating. And the people there were not overly intrusive by constantly coming up to us and asking how it was. Attentive without being overwhelming.   I came away with two thoughts: 1. Why am I not Indian so I can make this confidently at home? 2. How has it taken me 24 years to consume something so delightful?  Overall we both had a great time and can't wait to go again.",

    "text": "Y'know, I had to give myself a while to get over the figurative gastronomical blue balls I suffered at the hands of Flavors of India.  So here's the scoop.  I'm a business guy. This place isn't much to look at from the outside and there weren't but a couple of cars outside. They've a banner touting their differentiating advantage... \"Ice cold Coca Cola served here.\"  Ok, you have Coke..grand.  1965 is jealous.  But I loooove Indian food & even though I couldn't tell if they served alcoholic beverages, specifically Indian beers, from the online menu (they do) we throw caution to the wind & go on anyway.  We could always leave, right?    So upon entering we're immediately seized by the most pleasant aroma... Imagine the aroma scent finger seducing you to scarf down the big steaks like in Tom and Jerry.   Seriously, I saw that. It smelled delicious.   The gentleman who greeted us was pleasant and I assume the owner.  I've driven by here dozens of times and like I said, I seldom see more than a couple cars here.  Today was no different.  There were a total of 5 tables being occupied.  The people at 2 were eating and 2 were wrapping up in idle chatter.  At first I figured the lone server, who I figured to be the owner's wife as they were close in age, was simply being conscientious in not wanting to rush us to order.  After she passed our table a half dozen times and managed to avoid the eye contact we tried to connect with, we were able to ask what the really good looking food the couple at the booth next to us was.  Maybe it was my imagination, but the answers was curt and she seemed slightly annoyed. Again, as a business person I'd be excited.  Clue: those are buying signals.  We'd been there 10 minutes or so now and hadn't ordered.  Again, there are just 5 booths/tables occupied and all are nestled together in a tight cluster and I'm situated between two of them.  After another 4 or 5 passes from 1 to 3 and skipping me at table two, I wave, say \"excuse me\" and the lady puts up the \"hold on finger\" before I finally get her to let me order a beer and appetizers.  Clue: I'm buying alcohol and appetizers, we're polite and well coifed.  We may be a good table.  The sales guy in me is screaming inside at her inattention by now.  After 25+ minutes and having not been able to order an entree in a relatively empty place, it's a wrap. I ask for the check.  They tell me they were changing over their oil to explain delay. What's that got to do with paying attention to a customer? Nada.  I take the samosas to go and head to one of my fav restaurants instead.  It's a shame really, because I ate one of those samosas in the car and it was damned good. I mean, it was frickin' delicious and I suspect the solid reviews they've had on food would hold up. If only these guys could get selected to go on Bar Rescue to learn to attract and keep new customers.",

The buffet menu, which is known to change throughout the week, consisted of Basmati Rice, Tandori Chicken, Chicken Masala, Chicken Curry, various vegetable dishes containing spinach, lentils, potatoes, onion, fresh tomatoes and green beans, fried green chilies, mint chutney and Naan Bread. The menu items were served from traditional copper pots. This exquisitely flavorful lunch was capped off with fresh mango pudding and fried yogurt balls in cardamom-infused rice pudding for dessert.

    "text": "First time dining here. This review is strictly in regards to their dinner menu and not for their buffet. Personally in my experience, I've never enjoyed any Indian food buffet I've ever tried. Starting off, our party of 3 found the service to be very inviting and gracious. They really had a family business vibe. The cook, which I assumed to be the dad or patriarch, personally helped to deliver food to the table. We ordered the sampler (non-vegetarian) platter for an app which consisted of 2 chicken samosas, 4 chicken pakoras, and 4 shrimp pakoras. Delicious! Do not let the description of the pakoras defer you from order it. \"deep fried fritters\" yet they do not taste oily and the batter is made from scratch! For entrees, we ordered the sag chicken, lamb vindaloo, and paneer masala. Overall we liked the sag chicken the most because we thought the vindaloo could have been spicier (we requested 8/10 spice level). The sag was requested to be 10/10 spice and still wasn't up to par but made up for it due to its delicious flavor. We ordered the garlic naan and the peshwari naan. Garlic naan was a hit with the whole table. The peshwari naan was still decent (had coconut shavings inside which we thought to be a bit odd). Everyone had leftovers which definitely was a welcomed surprise. We do not know when we will be back but I know we will be sometime soon.",

The people who run this restaurant are always kind, and they ask how spicy you like it. I want the chole between medium and mild. I tried medium, and it was a little too hot for my Nordic taste buds. Even at the relatively low spice level that I get, I still need the mango lassi to help cool the fire! And it is all sooo good! It wouldn't be as good without a little spicy heat! :D Best of all, even my vegetarian friends can enjoy this dish! I love this restaurant and the sweet people who run it!",

I found this place on DOOR-DASH and decided to give them a shot...in a nutshell no forks no napkins no rice...and when I called to find out what happened no respect....so that means NO BUSINESS from me or any one I know... they're to many great Indian restaurants in Phoenix to compromise and eating here is definitely a compromise!!!",

Well, what came out was more like an over sugared tomato sauce. It was almost inedible. When we approached the server to tell her it was too sweet she tried to tell us that \"that's the way tikka masala tastes\". Ummmm, negatory good buddy. Nice try though.   We also got lamb korma and the meat was really, really tough. Sauce was decent.   For what you get and the price (side note: why the H is Indian food so expensive?!?) it's not worth it.   I don't recommend this restaurant. There are too many other amazing Indian places in the Phx area. You money and time are better spent elsewhere.",

I'm not eating bread, but temptation got me  and it was by far the best naan I've had. Fresh selection, except for the fried section, it seems it needs a better heat chute.  Update: I went back to this place, I'm not changing my stars, and I feel bad because the lady in charge is so nice. My comment has to do with one of the guys taking care of the food. He was probably sick and he was walking around replenishing trays, clearing his throat loudly, without covering his mouth. That made me uncomfortable, plus it's unhealthy. I hope they address the issue.",

The food was awesome and the Naan bread is to die for. they check on us enough to make sure we are doing okay but they do not over do it, so it is appreciated.   Our waiter was good, not talkative or welcoming, but got the work done, and I was fine with that. The hostess who I believe is the owner or wife of the owner is very friendly and asked about how we were doing and how we enjoyed the food.  I definitely recommend it, and make sure when they ask you how spicy you want, go with medium, it is still spicy enough to enjoy the flavors and the spiciness.",

When I walk into any ethnic restaurant and I see people of the same ethnicity of the restaurant eating there I get excited. It must be good right?   This table must have been family and eat for free because I have had better. The naan was just ok, the Tandoori chicken, meh (well I have never been a big fan of this anyway because almost anywhere it is usually just dry bland chicken to me). The butter chicken type dish with tomatoes, was ok but looked like they added red food coloring. I enjoyed the flavor of the meatball dish, the palak dish was bland. Honestly the only other dish I found interesting other than the meatballs was the Carrot \"pudding\" which was sauteed sweet minced carrots, went back twice just for that. The sweet rice was ok, it had raisins and coconut.  I generally prefer it without either.  I may go try it one more time and order off the menu for dinner. Give it a fair chance before completely ruling it out.",

    "text": "This isnt the most imaginative Indian buffet, but I like it for several reasons. Reasonably tasty fare, pleasant buffet service and AYCE prices around $9-10, but what I really appreciate is the subdued and somewhat elegant atmosphere, just a quarter mile south of the big do on Camelback.   There's a ton of busy Camelback restaurants, but it seems the choice is often between fast food, pizza or pricey event dining in the Biltmore or Esplanade. Flavors of India provides a relaxing, comfortable middle ground - sit down dining with real china and stemware at very affordable prices. That fills a niche this area needs.    Everybody forgets this place is right around the corner. It's rarely crowded and there's something comforting about getting out of the sun and the bustle and settling into FOI's dark environs for a leisurely Indian meal. The drink service. The naan. Chafing dishes being replenished. It's a gentle rhythm that suits me and nothing seems hurried like the corporate factories up the street. The people here seem to appreciate that you went a little out of your way to stop in, too.  I always leave feeling I've gotten my money's worth, and frankly, a little rejuvenated.   If you live in Mesa, I dont recommend making a special trip to find FOI.  It's not that good. But if you're in the neighborhood, stressed out from shopping and traffic, it's a soothing alternative, a bit off the beaten path.",

As I pick at the mango pudding and the carrot pudding (which seems like a dessert that is sweetened and full of butter) I will go over the highlights and lowlights of my culinary adventure- I enjoyed the spinach/cheese mixture; one of my go to dishes. The chicken tikka was ok, and the tandoori chicken was a \"B\". On the flip side, the assorted fritters had seen fresher days and the vegetarian/cabbage dish was not very flavorful, IMHO even with the big caraway seeds. The seeds were huge - to the point I was routinely picking them from my dish. Kudos to Yelp which enabled me to have another helping of mango pudding as I write this. Seeing how there are/were several Indian diners here, it can't be too bad.",

I tend to gravitate to Indian restaurants that offer excellent lunch buffets, as it gives you the opportunity to sample multiple dishes. The buffet offered at Flavors of India is just okay, but often a little on the bland side. I do enjoy their samosas, vegetable pakoras, and tandoori chicken, but most of the entrees offered at the buffet are underwhelming. The story changes, however, when you order items from the menu and ask for them on the spicy side. Their mutter paneer and aloo gobi are excellent and nicely spiced. My personal favorite here is the baigan bharta, which is spicy fire-roasted eggplant with onions and peas. The taste of it is just out of this world. This is a great place for take-out, where you can order items to your specifications.",

I noted the Bollywood videos playing in the background, I love those dang videos. The host was also my waiter. He invited me to help myself to the buffet. I'm not one of those people that knows the names of each and every dish. As I write this I'm kicking myself for not taking notes. As a whole, the buffet was a-ok.

The Biltmore area has some great lower key dining spots we want to point out to locals and travelers alike.  This is definitely worth a drive South of Camelback.",

    "text": "I have to start out this review by saying I never had Indian food before I ate here, so I didn't feel I could give it a fair review until I tried a few others around town first.  Well, now that I have, I have to say that \"Flavors Of India\" is the best Indian Food in Phoenix, bar none!  First off, when you walk into an ethnic food restaurant, and the place is filled with people of the same ethnicity, and the place is really quiet because everyone is busy enjoying their food, you know it's a good place to eat.    Is it a bad thing when the host/manager recognizes you when you walk in... and remembers your order?  You'd think we eat there a lot or something.  I've found my favorite dish is the Chicken Tikka Masala, medium spicy and if you like shrimp, the Shrimp Tikka Masala is just as yummy!  We usually order a side of the Paneer Kulcha (unleavened bread stuffed with Indian style cheese), which is wonderful to sop up the extra yummy sauce after you are finished.  Portion sizes don't appear to be too large, but we always have leftovers.  And it's always better the second day too!  The service is top notch, the food is excellent, and the best part of the dining experience is the Bollywood music videos playing on the flat screen!  Dinner and Entertainment all in one!  FTW!!!  I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I try to judge a place by how good it is at what IT does and what they do they do well here. In terms of quick and affordable buffet Indian eateries they seem to have it down.   I work in the area and often need a break from the Biltmore and Esplanade fare. When I head over here I tell the guys in the office and I always have a couple jump to go with me. The guests' first reaction is the same every time; we pull into the strip mall and skeptically get out eyeing the place which is unassuming on the outside to say the least. We open the door and walk in and you get the inevitable, \"Wow it smells good in here\". You are shown your table and asked for your drink order and then asked to help your self. You will find 8-10 entree dishes + salads, chutney and desert waiting for you that has all been consistently fresh hot, well prepared and thankfully light on the heavy cream that all Indian places pour into every dish to make the, um... crackers eat exotic foods. They bring fresh Naan bread (included) to your table and have a full menu available as well.   The place is owner run and they are polite and attentive. Indian movie dance scenes run the background on a TV set a volume that does not interfere with your conversation and you can get in and out quick between meetings if you need to. Your guests who picked carefully on their first trip return to the table with a second, full, plate and eat until they complain they ate too much because it was so good. Lunch for 2 with iced-tea is about $22 - quite deal as well.",

    "text": "Unlike other reviewers, I didn't like the buffet, though my friends from work think it's a good value. However, I've been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now, and have ALWAYS liked the food. FOI is my first choice for Indian cuisine in Phoenix, out of the four other Indian restaurants in the valley I've tried.   Yes, FOI is in a strip mall, but once inside, the ambiance is pleasant. It seems quite clean, I never got sick from anything I ate there (that's saying a lot, as I admit to being a fussy eater), and the waitstaff is helpful. Bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature, but the volume is low or completely muted, so you can watch or choose not to, it isn't distracting.   (Here's a footnote about that: I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election. My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar, watching electoral results, so he asked our waiter if we could watch too. After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables, it was quite late in the evening, silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on).  Regarding the food: I love their mattar paneer (cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy, with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese).  My super-spicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo (super-spiced as he requests).  Tandoori shrimp, chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier, the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh, warm and crunchy. Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be, biryani rice is overpriced (I'd stick with basmati rice as a side dish), and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink, similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat. My spicy friend says his gin-and-tonic was weak, and they don't have ingredients to make a Bloody Mary, but hey, FOI is an Indian restaurant, so I can't fault them too much for that!   Other pluses: open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants (seating ends at 9:30 pm); very fast with takeout orders; there's lots of parking; the 16 North bus stop is nearby; silverware, glasses, white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean.",

It appears that the management has changed and FOI is not better for it.  Perhaps the lunch buffet is still a good deal for the quality and quantity of the food they serve.  For dinner, it's offensive to charge $.99 for a side of rice to go with an order of Chicken Tikka Masala.  It's not an issue of the cost, but the principle of the matter.  Obviously, I'm going to order the rice.  Just up the price of all the dishes by a buck and throw us a bone with \"free\" rice.  And nearly $3 for a bowl of soupy Raita?  They need to change the name of this place to Nickel and Dime.         Farewell, Flavors of India, farewell!",

For dinner, I have never been disapointed.  The curry is spicy, the masala is sweet and delicious.  My only True complaint about the place is the decor and the music.

That should tell you everything I think about this place.  The lunch buffet is decent. It doesn't vary much so I know exactly what I'm getting every time I go. Since it's the only Indian place downtown, if I'm craving Indian, this is it. It's standard Indian. Nothing terrible, nothing spectacular.

(I hope I'm not making anyone cringe - but it's great and there's no food better than one you can eat with your hands!)   The location is odd, but I guess, after 3 years of being out here, I'm getting use to restaurants being in strip malls. The price of the food is reasonable - especially for dinner.   I took one of our Australian friends, who had recently moved to the States from London. He loved the food, and was thoroughly engage in a conversation with our waiter about cricket. (I kinda zoned out and watched the Bollywood music videos until they finished.)   Great place. Try it!",

I then asked why there was no rice with the chicken tikki masala. She said that is extra. Then why would you not mention that since who eats that with out rice!? She would not budge or offer anything- just kept saying I was in the wrong so I just hung up on her and had a sandwich. no customer service skills at all",

We had a bad experience with our food around Thanksgiving 2017.  The chicken makhani caused both of us to have stomach issues throughout the weekend.  Since I thought we had a good rapport, I called the restaurant and left 2 messages for someone to call us back.  They never called.  All could have been forgiven if they had returned a call.  We just wanted to make them aware for future customers that the dish was no good but we were ignored.  Since this has occurred, we have not been back to the restaurant which is very unfortunate.  We brought a lot of friends and family there but due to the treatment we received, we won't go back.",

Did I mention, while I am writing this review, I already placed to go order and will be picking it up shortly. :-)  When I first tried Flavors of India food, I ordered to go and had Chicken Tikka Masala, Basmati rice and Vegetable Samosas.  The chicken was superbly tender, masala was delicious and spicy enough, just how I ordered. Rice was cooked perfectly and Samosas are crispy on the outside and soft inside, perfect!   Excellent service! They make you feel welcomed. I picked up food from this place several time and always had great experience. It is bit dangerous that they are walking distance from my place as I can't never get enough of Indian food :-)   I can't wait to make it into the restaurant for dining in experience and also want to try their buffet one of these days.   Until then, I highly recommend this place! ~Namaste~",

The rest of the family had chicken dishes and they said they were delicious.  Even my incredibly picky and spice phobic son found their chicken Tikka Masala was good. Not chicken mcnuggets but good.  My daughter really loved the Mango chicken.  They made up a special vegan jalfrezi for me and my wife had the chicken vindaloo.    Don't be afraid of it being too spicy.  They wouldn't have been in business this long if they didn't know how to cater to all pallets.  I actually thought mine was mild and they had to bring chili chutney.   The atmosphere is pleasant and the prices are fair.  A family dinner for four with tip and no alcohol but with lots of happy tummies was under only $80 as of this writing.  That is absolutely everything including the tip.",

The number of dishes was limited to about six including vegetarian and chicken.  I was disappointed that there was no meat except chicken .... no lamb or goat.  Service was non existent since it is a buffet.  There was a man who delivered water but not happily.  He also brought nan which he put at the farthest end of the table.  No further contact with him and that was fine with me.  The woman seemed to be the binding force that held the restaurant together. The building was older and in need of remodeling but the establishment did the best it could with indian motif draperies and statues. There was no price list with the price of the buffet.  I thought $11.00  was a bit on the steep side.  I only had water and I did like the fact that the man brought a small pitcher of water for the table.   When I got home I yelped Indian Buffets again and found that $8 to 9$ seemed to be the standard price. Won't make that my \"go to\" place until I check out other Indian restaurants and have a comparison.  Until then, I won't go back regardless of the number of reviews.",

The service was prompt, kind, and helpful - they all worked as a team to ensure customers were well taken care of and had everything needed to enjoy their experience.   The food was unbelievably delightful. We ordered the #55 Navratan Korma (veggies cooked in a creamy curry-like sauce). The #55 Korma with the rice was money - I would recommend it every single time. We also ordered the #53 Baigan Bharta (mashed roasted eggplant with onions, green peas, and tomatoes) and paired it perfectly to dip with the garlic Naan bread. Word of advice to diners - always get at least one garlic naan order per person - and yes, definitely go with the garlic.  Overall it was a fantastic experience and it's so conveniently located near the Camelback shopping areas. So next time you're in the area, certainly stop here for excellent service and phenomenal flavors. Looking forward to visiting this place again soon.",

Chicken Tikka Masala: Very flavorful, good density, nice portion,  I would get again in a heartbeat...without the chicken, which was overcooked, tough and dry (even sitting in that lovely sauce).  I removed most of the chicken and gave it to the dog.  I should have gotten the Chana Masala...  Tandoori Chicken: Flavorful, well spiced sauce.  Overcooked.chicken (again...)  Dry and tough under the lovely sauce, bell peppers and onions.  Shameful...  Naan Bread: So I think those saying this place uses too much butter on the bread have got it wrong.  They are UNDERcooking the bread and the ingredients are possibly not balanced right!  It is doughy, internally damp and dense.  The undercooking makes it a bit gooey\\chewy and not the flat, airy perfection that is should be.  Super disappointment as naan is always delish!  Samosas (non-meat): Delish!  Seriously, even my young daughters liked them - though they thought they were a tad spicy.  I would get again, no problem!  Mango Lassi: Average - I let the girls and my husband finish as I wasn't super impressed.  Ugh, and please keep it chilled!  Aloo, Chole & Paneer: So so good!  Well spiced, right thickness, evenly cooked, wonderful flavor and aroma.  Such a keeper!  OVERALL: Like I said, I think this place needs to learn how to cook chicken and bread.  Then they would be a solid 4.  As is, the more I think about what a travesty all that undercooked, too dense, limp naan bread was, the more I am thinking a 2 is still being kind...

    "text": "Yesterday was my first time trying Indian food (don't judge meeeee!) and I'm now HOOKED! Anyone who hasn't tried Indian food, or is curious and wants to sample - go here.   This review is based on the lunch buffet, which beats out Chinese buffets any day of the week. You have a selection of 9-10 choices, plus dessert. The neatest part is the variety of food switches every day, so you're never eating the same thing over and over. Yesterday's buffet consisted of chicken masala (chicken, spices, tomato sauce cooked), daal makhani (lentil soup), bhindi (bombbbb okra!), chicken curry... and a ton of other goodies (dessert was shahi kheer - basmati rice pudding with almond and pistachios).   My only complaint was the bread, as it felt like it was covered in oil. However, for $11.99 and all you can eat - I don't really care.  Side note: they play this channel on their TV that's an Indian version of MTV - so freaking entertaining.",

Now just because of that, which is important to me, my wife and I only go there when the other two are closed. Sorry but I feel if I'm going to come to a place to eat and spend my money they should try to give good service.",

    "text": "Love them!  Whether it's take out or dining in.  It's amazing!  My first time trying to Flavors of India I ordered take out, a yelp recommendation   It was almost 9pm and I had a craving for either Caribbean food or Indian Food.  I Yelped Jerk chicken first, nothing in my area and opened during that time.  So I yelped Indian food.  Flavors of India came up .. with only 3.5 stars.  I wasn't intimidated by the 3.5 star review because I really had a craving so I gave it a try.  SO GLAD I DID!  I ordered chicken samomas, and chicken marsala to go.  The lady on the phone said it'll be about 20 mins.  I only live about 5 minutes away.  I left my house in 15 minutes.  Everything was ready, hot and waiting for me when I arrived.  The chicken samomas were so hot that I couldn't bite into them at all!  It was poppin hot!  No worries, that's such a good sign!  The minute I got home I opened the chicken marsala, put in on a plate and feel in love.  My eyes rolled in the back of my head as I chewed.  My heart smiled and my stomach was full after I finished my meal.  This was a Friday evening.  The portions sizes are huge.  I had plenty of leftovers for lunch Saturday for me AND enough to share with my boyfriend at the time.  He loved it!  The next weekend, the next Friday.  He said ... Let's go back to that India place you went to last year.  I said sure.  We dined in this time, shared chicken simosas and both of us ordered different chicken dishes.  I don't remember the name of either dishes but it wasn't chicken marsala this time, but it was served sizzling and saucy.  It's allll about the sauce ... and the bass   That was from a song I think! We also shared the Indian house beer.  It was light and paired so well with the chicken.  I highly recommended Flavors of India to everyone.",

Samosas and garlic naan are great as an appetizer. Their food is always fresh and spice level is spot on. The place and location may not look hip and trendy but that doesn't matter.

The mushrooms and eggplant dish were both very good. The mango pudding, although sounds plain, was absolutely delicious and tastes fresh. The chai tea actually tasted like chai tea and not like tea with milk, you can actually taste the spices in this one.  I was very pleased with my meal.

I went in again last week and had an excellent experience. The buffet is extensive and flavorable.  My only reservation is that the spice level is 1 or less, but the management seems to be eager to help with that issue or any others.  I will be returning with my wife for dinner on Friday or the weekend due to the excellent food quality, the attentive staff and the eager to please management.",

    "text": "Pretty standard Indian. And by standard, I mean this is what you will find at almost every Indian restaurant in America. I am no Genuine Indian food expert, but your average USA Indian restaurant will have the same menu as every other one, no matter what city or state you're in.   That being said, if that's what you're in the mood for, then FOI will fit the bill. It's in a very sad-looking strip mall, and the management of the restaurant must be very anxious about all of the empty storefronts around them. But the interior of the restaurant is spacious and comfortable, and when I walked in to pick up our takeout order, I was immediatelly greeted by a very friendly host.   The food was good, as far as overly-oily typical Indian fare goes. We ordered the Tandoori chicken, Tandoori fish, naan, and a cauliflower and potato dish. All were very tasty and served with basmati rice.   I have two criticisms of the food: 1)the onions in the tandoori dishes were raw. Perhaps if we had eaten there, they would have been served in a cast-iron skillet, which would have improved matters. I'll withhold final judgment until we try it again. The meats were all very good, though.  2)OILY. Oh my goodness, there must have been equal parts oil and vegetables in the cauliflower dish. I wonder if Indian restaurants are under the impression that Americans really do want their food swimming in oil and that's why they make it that way, or if True Indian food, in India, is also as oily as what you'll find at restaurants here? I don't have the answer.   **I will put in a plug here for Bombay Spice, at Tatum and Shea, which is Indian food made healthfully, without nearly as much oil or cream as most restaurants. I wish I could count on that everywhere. **  So, it was a solid 3-star experience, given that it met my expectations of very oily, very tasty average Indian food. It would definitely earn another star or two if someone in the kitchen made an effort to cook with health in mind. It's really not hard.",

    "text": "Not happy with this restaurant at all. Placed an order for take-out, and every single dish had an issue. We ordered paneer & potato masalas and palak aloo. Unfortunately, the best part of our meal was the plain basmati rice. Our masalas were made with the most disgusting over-microwaved potatoes I have ever consumed. The sauce was pretty good, but a little too sweet and since the potatoes were rubbery, tough and dark, it made it difficult to eat. The palak was even worse. We had to keep removing some ingredient that was woody and fibrous from the sauce. It was under salted, extremely bitter and tasted more like ginger and cream rather than spinach. I love ginger, but this was so overwhelmingly bad. For some odd reason, the potatoes in our palak were not microwaved like the masala was. I know that the paneer & potato masala is not on their menu, but I'd much rather them say that they cannot make it rather than give me something so awful. I'd expect so much better after paying $60 bucks. Sucks since this is the closest Indian restaurant by far. I'll just have to drive the distance next time. Boo.",

And with just a couple of exceptions, haven't found much of it in the Phoenix area that I would categorize as great tasting. Unfortunately, this place fell more into the norm of Phoenix Indian food than not.  I wasn't that it tasted bad... It just wasn't particularly awesome or memorable. Excluding the couple of saving graces of the aloo tiki (fried potato & Indian cheese fritters) & kheer (rice pudding), the food was just meh. And with a $10 price tag for the lunch buffet, I think that there are definitely better places for me to spend my lunchtime.",

I tried all of it and wasn't impressed. Lack of flavor. Service was eh.   So, highlight of the visit -- the restroom. What do I find? Baby roach, still struggling for life. Disgusting. If there are baby cockroaches in this place, that means they are breeding! More to come! I don't like to pay to eat at dirty places.   Though, they had an extensive vegetarian menu.   But the people here, the customers I mean, eh. They kinda have an attitude of, 'omg, ethnic food.' Pft. I got the vibe it was like a special occasion for them to eat at this dump... I don't know how to describe it, maybe I'm being a jerk but that's what I picked up on...  Why pay a decent amount of money for mediocre (at best) food?",

It was very slow to have our order taken, and it took almost 40 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food. The food itself was tasty enough, once it finally arrived.  However, the worst part about this meal was the COCKROACH that we discovered on the wall over our table.  Immediately, my friend and I began to point at it and talk loudly. We tried to get the attention of waitstaff for several minutes.  Finally, the cockroach fell onto our table. That was it. We leapt out of the booth and exclaimed \"COCKROACH!\" Is this the worst part of the visit?  NO.  Waitstaff then came over, pulled back the table, squashed the cockroach, and then gestured for us to resume our meal and said \"Cockroach gone.\"   At least the manager comped the meal.  But,  if there is one cockroach allowed to crawl around the dining room TABLES, I can only imagine what the kitchen might look like. I definitely can't imagine going back!",

In fact, the staff recognize me and my daughter and often ask if we'll have our regular, even if it's been months since our last visit.

I think their name should start the term \"Americanized\" or \"subdued.\" The dishes on the lunch buffet were standard but they lacked the vigor that good Indian food has.   I have gone here a few times for lunch with co workers, the vegetarian selection is decent. The fried items can be a bit soggy from sitting out too long.  The lunch buffet now is topping $10 which is pretty steep of a mediocre lunch. I feel like there should be a discount at places like this for vegetarians. The Naan, and water is brought tot you by a server so you may feel the need to tip on top of the buffet price.   There is the stereotypical bollywood music videos playing on the TV, with their psychedelic colors and lavish garb. Many of the serving trays make extensive use of aluminium foil which I doubt meets health code.",

During my meal the employees were still working on cleaning up the lunch buffet. This seemed somewhat unprofessional. It also made me question their level of cleanliness. For my meal I ordered the garlic naan, chicken vindaloo, rice. The naan was somewhat thin/soggy then what I was expecting. The spice and flavor of the vindaloo was perfect, however there seemed to be a lot potatoes in it. Portions were what I expected. Excellent service. My bill came to $17 plus tip. Due to the ambiance and the average quality of the food I would have been content with a bill around $12. But with it coming closer to $20, I would have expected slightly larger portions or improved interiors or some stellar tasting naan. I would only give this place a second chance in order to try out their lunch buffet.",

Since it was a holiday we didn't want to try our luck at any of the restaurants nearby so we headed over to Flavors of India which is right down the street.   The place was a lot cuter and nicer inside than expected. We were seated right away at a large booth and the hostess gave me a rose for the holiday. They had a special of a large plate of grilled meats for $13.95 which our waiter said was enough for 2. So we split that and also ordered our usuals, Paneek Pakor and Naan. Our waiter also suggested Indian Beer, and I can't remember the name of it, but it was very good.   The food was all very, very good. The naan was much better than the other Indian restaurant we frequent. I can't wait to go back to try my favorites (butter chicken and tikka masala) although everything they had looked so, so good.   I was really impressed overall and I love supporting local businesses like this one.",

Was planning on doing the lunch buffet but found out they don't have Chicken Tikka Masala on buffet.   Sad panda.  So, we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala with some Garlic and Plain naan.  Service was very good.  The plain naan was excellent, while the garlic was a little too garlic for our taste.   The chicken tikka masala was decent, however it was more of a soupy texture instead of a paste that I'm used to.",

Everything was piping hot and fresh. Service was timed well even with a large group in the restaurant. Good portions. The appetizer platter and the lamb vindaloo were delicious. The butter chicken was too buttery for my liking. Maybe it is a different style/region of cooking. I am still on the hunt for a place that serves butter chicken that will taste almost like my friend's mother's butter chicken.",

Like the seating of the booths, gives an intimate feel. I always judge Indian Cuisine by the lamb. So I order lamb Masala and my wife got the veg korma. Lamb was excellent you still could taste it slightly without being overpowered by the Tikka masala sauce. My wife absolutely loved the Veg Korma. Rice and nan was very good as well. Great portions and excellent prices. Will definitely check out the lunch buffet during the week!",

It is cooked in their Clay oven and comes out on a sizzling plate. Loved it!   We also got their chicken tikka masala, 3 orders of it! I sat and drank up the rest of the left over sauce when the chicken was gone - it was that good!   If you haven't tried Indian food and want to explore it, this would be the perfect place. I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy things, so it was great that they offer different spice levels. The people with me can handle spice, so they were able to order to their taste buds.

From the moment I sat down and saw the beautiful cloth on the table, I knew I was going to have a great meal.  This was also a FIRST for me. I ordered a mango lassi immediately (no waiting until the end of my meal). When it arrived at the table, it was the most beautiful color, not watered down with ice either, just creamy mango lassi. One slurp and one OMG, and my lassi was ripped from my clutches, making the rounds at the table with equal ohs and ahs from all who drank this elixir. I didn't let go of it after that; my fingers glued tightly onto the glass. Selfish? Yes.  The beauty of four of us is the luxury of family style or tasting four unique dishes. The aloo gobi masala had huge pieces of cauliflower. Yum. The lamb vindaloo was ordered at an 8/10. One of us likes it to burn; since he was picking up the tab, we all silently hoped it would arrive at the table with a little less firepower. Thankfully it wasn't an 8, more like a 4. The chicken jalfrezi was excellent with the onion chutney, and shrimp tiki masala had big shrimp! The plain naan and rice were the perfect additions to our meal to soak up the wonderful sauces.   A TV played an MTV-like station, but as my back was to this, I didn't really pay attention to it. There was too much going on at my table to be distracted. Service was excellent.   Great meal! What's next? Their lunch buffet.",

I assure you it's the first option. We went in with family visiting from out of town and got a nice corner table. They greeted us right away. We had appetizers, 4 entrees and mango lassi. The only complaint was one of our party wasn't too crazy about the lamb dish. He says it was a bit too fatty for him. I don't eat meat so I can't vouch for any of that but I will tell you that the smells were so good and the flavors omg! The leftovers I devoured over a few days, tasted better the next day too! At first the Gobi manchurian was not exactly what I was craving (I had it at another place where it was spicier/sweeter). But....the day after I had the same dish as leftovers and it seemed like the flavors were even better than the day before. It allowed me the opportunity to appreciate the difference from the one I had been craving and now I think I like theirs even more (at Flavors of India!). Great job guys! Nice service, excellent food and good $$. Definitely seeing you again soon for dinner or lunch.",

This one was not.  The flavors of all the dishes we ordered was wonderful. Unfortunately, they were not hot enough. I would have needed to order them all at 10 to warm my mouth and excite the senses.   We ordered an Aloo Gobi Masala, chicken jalfrezi, shrimp tikka masala and lamb vindaloo with a side order of naan and rice. To wash down the food we had a Kingfisher beer, a Flying Horse beer, a house Cabernet Sauvignon, and a mango lassi.  We were greeted when we arrived and seated quickly. As it was a Thursday evening at about 6:30, we did not have a reservation, which was not necessary.  The waitress was ready to take our order after we had finished devouring the papadums. The drinks arrived quickly and the food soon after. We had to order a second helping of rice as, for four people, one serving dish was not quite enough.  We had a little food remaining after we had eaten our fill that we were able to pack up and take home for later. Just enough for a snack for two people.  I would return to this restaurant but I would need to make sure that they understood that I really enjoy spicy  food.",

I originally wasn't going to check this place out b/c it's a pretty long drive since I live in Tempe and am afraid of driving on the interstate, but I'm glad I did!   The buffet offered about the same variety, if a little more, than most Indian buffets - a couple chutneys, salad fixings, three chicken options, basmati rice just flavored with like cumin seeds, pakora, creamy veg masala, creamy black daal, chana masala, okra, and three deserts (kheer, mango custard, carrot halwa). A basket of naan is brought to the table. North Indian food, with a very mild spice level.   Everything I ate (which was almost everything that didn't have chicken) was very good. If you didn't like North Indian food, which in my experience (esp in restaurants), tends to be richer and often more cream-based, you would not enjoy the buffet, but luckily there is no region of South Asia whose food I haven't enjoyed so I liked it a lot! In particular like - the specific offerings are not especially uncommon, but their execution is just very very tasty.   Service was also very friendly and good - I got the impression it is generally the same woman at the front / seating ppl / checking people out (for which I have limited evidence, but the ppl paying after me called her by name and said \"another wonderful lunch\" so I made some assumptions), and she was great. Prompt, polite, friendly service.   I probably won't come back TOO often b/c there are nearer-by places I like just as much, but if you live closer and despair at the concentration of Indian buffets in the valley in and around Tempe, you've got a great option in Flavors of India.",

I met the chef/owner & his lovely wife. They are extremely hospitable & take excellent care to make their patrons happy. They change their buffet daily so it's not the same every day. Excellent naan they make fresh as you sit down & desserts are yummy too! Look forward to returning for dinner & seeing their menu options.",

There is always a lentil dish and spinach or Cauliflower.  If I had any complaints, it would be too offer more than an array of chicken dishes and to mix it up more with lamb, beef or fish. However, the spice level is relatively mild and they bring fresh, hot Naan to your table. The staff is very pleasant and service is prompt. If you're in a hurry, this place will have you in and out during their lunch buffet in no time flat.  We will return again and again over the coming years!",

We ordered Lamb Vindaloo and the Chicken Tandoori Murg Masala...both were very good, loved the spices, chicken and lamb were tender. We also had Basmati rice /Vegetable Biryani which is my favorite and Mango Lassi to drink. It's family run...they are very friendly, eager to give advice on what to try and just make you feel at home. I do recommend coming here. It's a little bit pricey but we don't have Indian food very often. I will come back to try their buffet sometime soon.",

The dishes at the buffet really lacked the oomph that I am so used to at Indian restaurants, and unless the pot was personally stirred, some of the dishes were room temperature. As far as pricing, it wasn't too bad; it was just around $10.   After reading other reviews (Mainly Lisa O's) I would consider trying this place after the buffet is put away.

It's akin to two soups being different because one has mushrooms but the other one doesn't.   You can't go wrong using naan with the four dishes I listed, their naan is soft and not too thick or thin (though I've had friends say they thought it was on the thin side).  I am not a huge fan of the mango lassi that they make here. It's got a little too much milk and not enough mango.   The chai tea here is decent, but don't get it to go. I've heard that the lunch buffet here is good, but can't make it over here during to daytime to check it out.",

    "text": "Chicken Tikka Meh-Sala\r -------------------------\r Hey! An Indian restaurant in central Phoenix! How about that? Awesome, right?\r \r Um. Don't get too excited, O.\r \r I get seated in a booth by the front door and survey the scene. Groups and dates of people eating. Flat screen panel showing a sequence of 2006's most craptastic Bollywood videos. Bar stocked with Johnny Walker Black Label, because if you're Indian, that's what you drink. Mango lassi is for wusses.\r \r I order ground chicken samosas, boneless chicken kebabs, and lamb vindaloo with rice, naan, and raita. Complementary papadum and chutney is placed on my table. Soon after 4 dinky samosas arrive on a small plate. They were ok. Meh is more like it.\r \r Then I wait a LONG time (20+ minutes) for my entrees. I know grilling chicken takes a while, but these were small boneless pieces - I know it's not supposed to take longer than 4 music videos of Indian hero boy and Indian heroine girl disco dancing in the forest and then all of a sudden a rainstorm and her sari is wet....\r \r ....where was I? Oh yeah. People who came in and ordered 10-15 mintes after I did received their food within 8-10 minutes. That kind of annoyed me. I seethed a little, but only to myself, because I'm suave like that.\r \r Eventually my dinner shows up. Chicken pieces in a sizzling platter. Vindaloo served in an antique metal bowl. Good on the presentation, I'll give them that.\r \r The naan was crisp, which is a good plus, because the divine whomevers ruling the universe will strike upon those, the evil misguided purveyors of the Earth's soggy, limp naans. Oh, they will be struck down, mark my words. \r \r The chicken, for it taking so long, was very tender and juicy but really mediocre tasting. Mediocre to the point where I recognized the jarred tandoori sauce they marinated the chicken in. So not good to do, my Indian restaurantering friends. \r \r The vindaloo was alright...but with really small cubes of lamb and potatoes. I asked for them to make all of my food really spicy, because, well, I'm brown like they are and that's how we roll. But they took it as to make it as bland as possible. Maybe they thought I was an 87-year old English man named Alistair for whom even a sprinkle of crushed black pepper would set his mouth on fire. Who knows.\r \r What I do know is that I was disappointed something huge. An Indian restaurant so close to where I live, and yet so debatable whether if I'm ever going to go back.\r \r So two stars (maybe a little greater than two, like two-and-a-third) for the Indian food and Indian service equivalent of  beige. Decent ambiance and friendly host-owner, though, so hey, if you're in the 'hood and are hankering for some curried meh, you've got your ideal place right here. You can thank me later by performing your own Bollywood video.",

I've ordered the same thing for take out a few times now. Medium heat is perfect. It has a little kick at the end, but not too spicy that you can't finish or enjoy the taste. The garlic naan is delirious as well   I've had the chicken before, but I definitely feel like the lamb has more flavor (two of my friends have tried both and they agree with me).",

This place is on the pricey side, but at least the food is pretty good.  Their service is a bit slow though. My boyfriend and I were literally the only ones in there for dinner at 8pm, but it took them at least 10 minutes to take our order and another 20-25 minutes to get us our food.   Giving it four stars for the friendly service and because the food was above average, but not sure I will keep coming back just because I've been to other better indian places.",

For the price, the buffet was worth it! 2nd time i went, some currys were bland and I had to add a lot of salt. But honestly, for the price, i couldnt complain! They bring out unlimited naan bread as well :)",

    "text": "Bad food and extremely rude customer service!  We came in after following the good reviews. Unfortunately the experience wasn't pleasant at all.Pls note that we got seated by a server followed by a different server who took our our order and finally other different server who served our food.  We ordered two chai, samosa, aloo paratha, and chicken Tikka wings since we just wanted some Indian appetizers. Our chai (tea) was too bitter and lacked milk. I make masala chai every morning so I know what a good chai looks like. Having shared the issue with the second server (apparently she seemed like the owner) she gave us some extra milk. However, it was of no use. Our tea had some green particles in it. I showed it to the server, she took our tea, came back with the same cup of tea and said it's Celantro. Seriously??? She didn't even apologise and insisted it was just Celantro. Even if it was, aren't you supposed to take out the cilantro and serve us a different cup of chai??? Isn't that how it suppose to work or I am expecting too much as a customer?  Next, the aloo paratha was dry and uncooked. No butter spread at all on top of the paratha.  Lastly, the wings, it  read \"prepared in CLAY oven\" in the menu. So we expected it to be char grilled. But it wasn't. Rather it tasted different. Again, we shared our concern and the same owner server started playing defensive. She kept insisting and arguing that there was nothing wrong with the chicken. Later,  she went to talk with the chef, came back after few minutes, and said that it was cooked in ELECTRONIC oven, that's why it lacked smoky flavor. OMG, I have never been to any restaurant with this level of disrespect and bad attitude towards customers and the food they serve. Please get your facts correct and display the same in your menu so that customers are not misguided.   The experience was a total disaster. Very rude customer service and bad food, no authenticity. It clearly felt like they were just trying to make money. No respect for the food they prepare and serve. After all this, they still charged us th full price for all the items (we threw all the food especially the chicken, barely even touched it). Never going back again.",

It is a lovely family restaurant with good quality food. We had the mango lassi, and I ordered and extra one to go because it was so tasty. The dishes were all flavorful. We had garlic naan which had just the right amount of chewiness and crunch. Happy to have this place as a new go to!",

As one of my friends so eloquently stated, \"I want to bathe in this stuff!\" XD The flavors are incredible, with its magic blend of spices, butter, and tomatoey, creamy sauce, perfectly seasoned. It was one of the dishes at the lunch buffet here. When we went they had tandoori chicken legs, chicken curry (Bone in dark meat), chicken makhani, palak paneer, aloo gobi, dal (Yellow lentils), with three different pakoras, chana masala, and a salad bar off to the side. Desserts included carrot halva and mango pudding. Basmati rice is also at the buffet and they will bring you freshly baked naan to your table as well. I enjoyed all the elements in the buffet and service was very friendly.   The total price when I checked out at the front was $12. Overall it's not a bad deal for all you can eat!",

Ironically the menu clearly denotes the meat dishes under a header labeled \"Non-vegetarian dishes\" as if the vegetarian dishes are the norm/default way of eating.  I found that very charming.  The portions are extremely generous. You get a huge bowl of rice with your meal for just $.99.  This is a very solid place close to everything in the Biltmore/Camelback area.  We'd definitely eat here again.",

    "text": "Really good flavors, consistently impressive spicing, and friendly service. I'm impressed by this restaurant, so much so that I came back twice in the span of a couple days.   There's a large parking lot outside, the inside is clean if a little dated, and there is booth as well as table seating. Lunch includes buffet and to-order dishes, while dinner is just to-order.  Buffet: Most of the buffet dishes are either made with chicken or vegetables, but there was a good variety. There were cream-based dishes, curry dishes, lentils, spinach-based dishes, and paneer. Plain naan is included, as well as rice. There are some raw vegetables including cucumbers and ice berg lettuce, not to mention tomatoes and onions. Desserts included rice pudding, mango pudding, and fried balls of dough in sugar syrup. While not as good as their to-order dishes, I thought that this was one of the better lunch buffets I've had.  Lamb curry: This was my absolute favorite rendition of this dish that I've ever had. Curries usually taste pretty one-dimensional to me despite all the spices, but this was not the case. There was a great balance of savory and sweet, the consistency was just right (sometimes curries can be too liquidy for me), and the lamb was cooked until it was tender but not overdone. It was so good that I was tempted to order another to take back.  Lamb korma: I really liked the flavoring of this dish as well, although it was heavier than the lamb curry because it was cream-based. Even so, I thought the balance was definitely there, and the meat was cooked well.   Garlic naan and rice: I liked that the rice was seasoned, but not so seasoned that it interfered with the other dishes. The garlic naan could have used a little more garlic for my taste, but it was cooked well and airy and soft.  I think I've found my favorite Indian restaurant in the area, and I'll surely be back.",

Unfortunately, I've struggled to find good flavorful Indian food that wasn't all the way over in Tempe. Not anymore!  So I called in a Chicken Tikka Masala , 2 orders of garlic naan, and some basmati rice. They asked me how hot I wanted it! This is a good sign as most of the other places don't even ask. I say spicy. They did not disappoint! The curry was the perfect consistency, not watery or too thick. The spice level was close to perfect - could have gone up a level for me. The garlic naans tasted fresh and delicious. This was enough food to split for 2 people as they give generous portions.   All in all I'm beyond excited to find a good quality Indian place that is nearby. Their menu selection is vast, their prices are decent, portions are generous, and the quality of food is very good. I will be coming back to try their other dishes!",

I waited about 50 min to an hour for my to-go order which was supposed to take 30 min so I recommend ordering ahead of time and taking your time to get there. Regardless, worth the wait! The workers are also very sweet and are glad to give you a table and ice water while you wait for your order. The wait time is the only reason I give this 4 stars, if they told me it would be an hour then it'd be okay but I hate being told it'll be way less than what it actually takes and I'm left waiting for an unknown amount of time",

We also tried their sampler platter of some of their meats and once again I thought it was okay. The prices are also a little expensive. Their rice was really good and seasoned nice. Not sure if I will be back, but if I will then it will probably just be for the vindaloo.",

The atmosphere was calming, relaxing and also had a bit of flare to it. We thought it was beautiful! And the service that was given to us.... Some of the absolute best. Our server, host and manager (owner) of the restaurant was so attentive, caring and you can tell they took pride in the food and quality in which they have provided.  I can't not remember the names of the exact dishes we have ordered but I didn't forget to take some pictures of the most delicious Indian food I have ever tasted in Arizona.  From the homemade warm soft bread, to the mouth watering flavorful chicken, everything was absolutely delicious. Even to the desserts we had order. Nothing about this placed can disappoint. Leaving with a full belly and a warm chai tea to go! We couldn't have asked for a better way to end the night!   We definitely plan on coming back time after time.

It's not the kind of place to take a date you want to impress, but it's the kind of place to go with your friends for a pretty good meal.

The all you can eat buffet for $10 is the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. I dream about their delicious buttery toasted naan and rich chicken masala. The restaurant is clean, and service is fast and attentive - because we are eating plate after plate after plate. Best Indian food in the area. We walk in and make a beeline to the buffet...like, before even finding a table. Where else can you eat within two seconds of walking in?! Nowhere.",

There was a group of five in the center of the restaurant that was enjoying themselves it seemed but other than that it was empty. We were offered some thin flat and crispy cracker type thing and a dipping sauce which was nice and some water, it didn't take long for our server to ask what our order was. We got the masala and butter chicken. We had to order the rice and naan separate, other places gave those along with the meal. The food was ok, not amazing but not bad either, the naan was only one piece and the prices were kind of high for what you get. Service was friendly but not enough to make us go back.",

    "text": "This restaurant is near our home so we have visited it on quite a few occasions - always for dinner. The food has always been pretty good, though in recent months, we've noticed that the recipes have been substantially improved. We find that we are more frequent diners nowadays.  Today, flavors are more distinct and better balanced. The Vindaloo has has an appropriate tartness against the spice. The tomato-based curries are richer, with a good balance of salt and sweet. We like hot dishes, but usually order them \"medium\" for our friends - and that has worked very well, with everyone enjoying the dishes.   Their location in a strip mall off 16th street doesn't look like much in the evenings, with all the other businesses closed and standard LED open signs flashing, but inside the restaurant is clean and nicely appointed, though admittedly it can be a little too dim for some folks. We could live without the endless Bollywood clips on the TV screen in the dining room (just the bar would be okay), but they do make for comical dinner conversation on occasion.  Service is always genuine, efficient and friendly. Big, cold Indian premium beers are always welcome on a hot Phoenix night and they are served with tall, cold glasses.  Take it from a long-time Phoenix resident that loves Thai, Indian, Cuban and Mexican food -  if you're looking for good Indian food in the Central corridor, try this restaurant for dinner. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but there's always parking and it's very good.",

The food is always fresh, the service is always good and BONUS*** They always play those Indian music videos with everybody dancing!!!    I prefer doing the buffet thing because I only know a few dishes that I like. It's about $10 a person, and you will not leave hungry. The Tandoori chicken here is the best I've ever had and they have plenty of vegetarian dishes, if that's your bag. I sometimes get buffet takeout, and eat Indian food all day for about $10. If your looking for some good Indian food or never tried it and are looking for some variety, this is the place!",

The first time I went for dinner, I asked for spicy, and it was a bit more than I anticipated, but I can't complain because it is what I asked for, I just wasn't ready. The lunch buffet was delicious, there is an excellent variety of food available, good for vegetarian and meat lovers. Everything was flavorful, and spiced perfectly. I left perfectly satisfied. I have only two complaints. 1. It is beyond cold in there, so make sure to bring a sweater or something warm with you if you are sensitive to cold. 2. I notice that the staff only asks Indian patrons if they would like roti's or naan with their buffet. I was just given naan without a question, which I ate, but I definitely would have chosen a roti had I been offered the choice.",

I enjoyed pretty much every item in the lunch buffet. The main dishes were really savory; I especially liked the onion and cauliflower pakora. The  heat level of the dishes that were spicy was just right for me. The two desserts offered - mango pudding and rice pudding - were superb and an excellent way to cap a great meal.

This place also has great garlic naan, but don't let that distract you from their amazing regular naan.   I also want to point out that the service here is really good.

Next time, I will order mild. Other than that my food order was good.  Also the customer service was excellent and friendly. Great customer service at any establishment is super important to me. In addition, the delivery of my food order came out in adequate time! Something any customer can appreciate.   The only things I didn't like about the establishment, is, it needs a renovation and/or makeover. The resturant's decorations appeared 1990ish!   Key B's Recommendation: To appreciate good customer service. Also prompt delivery of ordered food. Desire to eat something different, I recommend the Taste of India!",

I am pretty simple when it comes to indian food, all I want is butter chicken rice and naan oh and Mango Lassi. I ordered the food to go and was so excited to get back to my hotel room to devour this food.   To my surprise, the butter chicken taste like Tomato soup with chicken in it. I know the butter chicken is a tomato base but this butter chicken was not very good. Maybe I went on a bad day.",

I liked their cleanliness, ambiance, and just on service alone, this place should be 5 stars, but I had to leave room for other important things.... Like the food:/ I have been in an Indian Buffet tryout lately, and this one sadly scores the lowest on food. Which is funny because it is the one with the highest price tag. So, they charge an extra dollar or 2 than others ($11) but they offer no lamb... Or goat! It was very disappointing to find not many options of meat, except for the curry chicken and the chicken leg. I was actually moving all around outside the buffet thinking I was missing a line of other buffet options, but nope... That was it! I tell you something though. Their chapati (flatbread) is the best. It has like a hint of garlic and butter on top, and it was hot and fresh, so that most definitely saved the day, but not enough for me to be back. Just personally.",

Chicken tikka masala was delicious---especially for here in Phoenix. It's hard to find good Indian food around here. This is the best in the surrounding area.   Vegetable pakora was pretty good.   Garlic naan was a bit soggy. Could be better if you ordered it in house.    Raita was flavorless---I'm from Chicago so I've had some really good ones. Wasn't bad. Just not worth the money. Maybe ok if you need to cool down the spice in your meal but not if you're adding flavor.   Overall would have given 5/5 if just judging on the chicken tikka masala, went down to 4 because of raita and naan.",

Here are my only complaints (but they wont deter me from coming back because the food was great):  1) they charge for rice 2) the food is pretty pricey  I would come here more often if it was a little bit cheaper, but if I am in the mood to splurge on something out of the ordinary or special this is a good spot.

Last night, both the food and the service were sub-par. We ordered the garlic naan, which was inedible due to having so much raw garlic it made my eyes tear. Next, we ordered the vegetable appetizer assortment, of which most was inedible being either burned or too salty. The only item on the plate that was edible were the samosas. The shrimp biryani and shrimp tikka masala were average, with the tikka masala tasting as if it had scorched in the pot. We waited over half an hour for our entrees to appear after getting our appetizers. We had to ask for clean plates for our entrees, because our entree plates held the remains of the garlic naan and appetizers. The waitress never questioned why we didn't eat the garlic naan or the vegetable appetizers. We weren't the only party who received bad service. There were only two other parties in the restaurant at the same time as us, and one of the others had to flag down the waitress to get their check and then again to pay it. It's really hard for me to justify paying a little over $50 for dinner for two, since half of the food was inedible. I won't be back.",

We're vegetarians-we ordered the eggplant dish and lentils dish, both which were tasteful.  The naan bread was a bit too crusty compared what we've tried before. The samosas  were unusually small, but good-I liked the spices they used on them.  The huge plus was they put fresh herbs on the dish.  The prices were reasonable for two dishes, and we had plenty to left over to bring home. I was fairly entertained by the Bollywood playing on the tv. (I just LOVE bollywood dancing!).",

    "text": "I'm giving this place a generous 4 stars because the food is actually very tasty. I've been here twice now, and I'm never disappointed. Indian food has to be on the top of my list for favorite cuisines, and I am sad to say there aren't many or any great Indian restaurants that I have found in Phoenix. Flavors of India, however, seems to satisfy my palate. I enjoy the chicken tikka masala every time. I have also tried the curry chicken, which is also very tasty. The chicken is very fresh and tender, both the light and dark meat. The naan is a bit flat and not soft or chewy enough for my taste, but it does its job. I really enjoy their basmati rice. It's not the most elaborate or flavorful I've ever had, but for some reason, I'm drawn to it, and even crave it. There's no saffron or cloves; it's a bit on the simple side, and just a tad bit sticky. The samosas are decent, although I have had better. If you are in the mood for some Indian food, and this place is close by, I suggest you head on over. Prices are reasonable. Two can eat for 30 bucks, including multiple appetizers. The food is prepared quickly. It's not the prettiest of restaurants but it has it's interesting Indian decor with a twist of Mexican thrown in. At least that's my impression. I don't like that they are closed on Sundays, since that's when I typically like to eat Indian food. The quantity is definitely sufficient, and you will have left overs, unless you like to \"pig out.\"   Try it, you'll probably like it!",

    "text": "So I just moved to Phoenix not too long ago and have been trying out new places. I love Indian food, and a friend recommended this place. I'd been to other Indian restaurants here and wasn't too impressed. This place was different.  The food was very good, though since I went for the lunch buffet it probably wasn't as fresh as it would have been ordering from the menu. That said, I saw the staff bring fresh stuff several times and it tasted great. The place smelled just amazing- I think my sweater smelled like Indian food for two days (in a good way!). The staff were very attentive and helpful, even though they were obviously very busy, too. Good service, great food and reasonable prices...what more could I ask for? This place is definitely a keeper!",

And, while this is supposed to be a spicier dish, which I would normally love, I found it to be spicy but not entirely flavorful. The onion kulcha was fine. Considering it's proximity to my apartment I may check it out again (perhaps stay away from the meat)?",
