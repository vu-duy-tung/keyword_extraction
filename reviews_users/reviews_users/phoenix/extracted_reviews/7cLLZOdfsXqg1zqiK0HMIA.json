This place would have made for a nice romantic experience however I was traveling with a buddy and I was not looking for a Bromance...  A little pricey, nice experience and good food. Watch for the roaming ducks and geese.  =RAY=",

    "text": "Loved our dining experience at Chart House last Tuesday, Aug. 20. It was our 30th Wedding Anniversary and we wanted to go somewhere that combined decent food with a view, but would not bust our budget in the process. So used Open Table to make our reservations and mentioned it was our anniversary in the Comments Section. We had tried to get in for Mother's Day this year but it was booked-had driven past it from Scottsdale Road before but never actually seen the place. We were pleasantly surprised at the beautiful stone entrance surrounded by water with a sizable number of ducks.   Once inside we were handed menus that said Happy 30th Anniversary at the top. After we ordered, the Server presented them to us wrapped in a bow as a memento. How unique and thoughtful a gesture that was-we were blown away. I ordered the Crusted Tilapia meal-real tasty. Actually it was a package for 2 that included appetizer, soup or salad, main course, and dessert. Everything was tasty and our view of the lake and ducks was magnificent. Quite a memorable way to celebrate our milestone anniversary.  We definitely plan to go back there and will recommend to others. Very impressed with the ambiance, the service, and the meal. The entire dining experience was one we will never forget.",

They had everyone who was there seated at tables right next to each other all in the same room.   I guess they wanted everyone to have a scenic window seat but it made for a very crammed and loud dinner experience. It was our fault that we didn't ask to be moved.  The food was just okay. I feel that we could have had just as good a meal at an average chain restaurant and paid half the price. The desert was very good though. Again, the staff and service were great! Absolutely no complaints there. The food however was just mediocre for what you're paying.",

The views just after sunset are out of this world. Nothing beats sitting on the deck over looking the lake and enjoying a great glass of wine and their famous handmade lava cake. I recommend it with the chef made peanut butter ice cream. They also have a killer happy hour Monday through Friday from 4:30-7:00. If your looking for a great night out I highly recommend the Chart House in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "It was our anniversary and I wanted to take my wife to Chart House as that was where our first date was in Vail Co. I have eaten at several Chart Houses throughout the country and it was one of my favorite restaurants. Upon entering at our reservation time of 5:00 pm, it was apparent they were not prepared to start serving anyone. We were seated at a 5 top and when we asked if we could get a table by the window, the waiter seemed perplexed. He thought we had 5 in our party and we explained that there was only 2 and the reservation was at 5 pm. Upon seating we were served with our menus that had our names printed on them. Nice touch but it helps to spell the name correctly ! My wife had Salmon which was ok and I had prime rib which was overcooked. We both had the salad bar which is one of the main reasons we love Chart House. We were very disappointed!! No caviar, no Ceaser salad made up and nothing really special about it.  Service was mediocre and we had to flag the waiter down to get our drinks filled. They boxed up the leftovers and we went home feeling very disappointed. When we got home, we realized what they really think about their customers. My prime rib was thrown in a small container with the potatoes thrown on top. There was no Ajus or horseradish sauce so I got to have a dry pie of leftover meat the next evening. My wife's salmon was packaged the same.  Probably the reason the restaurant was fairly empty.",

The salad was mediocre and the service was even worse. We ordered 10oz prime rib, mine was medium rare and hers was well. They mixed up our plates and the prime rib was cold and after a few minutes we asked are waiter and he realized they were wrong. So he asked us to simply just switch our 7 oz of prime rib left because they were sold out and had no other option. So I switched my piece of meat with my associate of 3 days. At the end of the plate I had about 4oz of fat left which was triple the amount the other piece had. While I was looking to grab a manager to talk to my wine flight had been taken with over half a glass still being saved for our dessert. When I spoke with a manager about the many problems I had encountered over the horrible evening she simply said \"uh huh\" and walked away and we left with our bill $160 for the 2 of us and so much dissatisfaction.",

Anyways the food was great but to top my experience my server was even greater. Josh was our server and he went above and beyond his duties. My two year old daughter was with us and when she wanted cherries from my drink and couldn't have them he went and got her a plate of cherries then when she was eating all my croutons he went and grabbed her a bowl of croutons. It's the little things like that, that made my experience so great! Plus he was just all round a great service provider and fun to talk too. So thank you Josh I hope you get some to read this or someone acknowledges you because you were awesome!",

My entree came exactly the opposite of what I ordered and took too long to be replated. The portion was much skimpier than past visits. The server checked back late upon original service and too late for drink refills. Despite my comments to the hostess and server, no manager was in sight all evening.

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying that I don't think this was our servers fault entirely, but everything that could have possibly been wrong with a dining experience happened at this place.  I have never been to another Chart House location but I have been to other Landry's restaurants with mixed results.  This place however was one of the worst experiences I've had in a long time.   My girlfriend and I came here because it was down the road from the hotel we're staying at and they offer 1000 point reservations on Open Table.  We had reservations at 8:45 at night so I guess maybe they were wrapping up for the night but for the prices they charge I would expect the same level of service anytime they are open. We were seated and our server Joe took our orders promptly.  We both ordered dirty gin martinis and bread was brought out promptly afterwards.  We also ordered oysters when we place our drink orders.  After a good 10 minutes we got our oysters which is reasonable for an appetizer order, but still no drinks.  After eating all of our bread and starting to eat our oysters we were still left without our drink orders.  Finally after I would say was 15 to 20 minutes we received our drinks.  I ordered my martini with blue cheese stuffed olives which weren't available at the time so he brought out regular olives until they could be made which was fine.  However he made my martini completely different from the other martini (it was made \"perfect\" which i guess is equals part gin and vermouth).  He did ask if I wanted it remade and I said I would give it a try since I didn't know how long it would be until I received another drink.  During this time it looked like he was the only server left on with 4 tables left to serve so I am not sure if this was the servers fault or the bartenders in regards to how long it took get my drink but that long of wait and to have it come out wrong is inexcusable.   And that was just the drinks.    We place our orders for dinner and I ordered the large cut of the prime rib and the salad bar while my girlfriend ordered a side caeser salad and an appetizer.  I went and had the salad bar which was actually pretty descent.  I would even go as far as saying the salad bar was the highlight of the meal but I can get that at golden corral.  I proceeded to eat my salad since at this point we probably there for 30 minutes and at that point only had just received our drinks and had bread and oysters.  I finished my salad bar plate and my girlfriend had to wait another 10 minutes before receiving her salad.  The entire timing of how they brought our food was pretty poor overall.   After finishing our salads, they brought out our entrees.  I ordered the 18oz prime rib medium rare and my girlfriend ordered an appetizer that had raw ahi tuna and tuna tartare.  Her food actually looked somewhat appetizing and was somewhat tasty.  My prime rib however was nowhere remotely close to be cooked medium rare.  I understand I ordered a large cut of prime rib but it was brought out almost 90% well done through out.   I'm not sure if at the time of plating it was cooked like that or it had sat there for a while and thats why it was so well done but it no way is it ever acceptable to bring out a cut of meat so far from what you ordered.  It would be one thing if maybe it was medium or medium well but this was definitely well done.   At this point I almost was going to tell the server to not even bother to bring me another one because again I had no idea how long it would take to receive my food again.  I brought it to the attention of my server and he assured me it shouldn't take very long since it was medium rare.  It was brought out shortly after and the prime rib was close to medium rare.  It was OKAY.  Nothing to write home about.   In the end we received our bill which was $128, which would be just fine for a descent meal somewhere but for our experience was not even remotely worth the money.   Our server was nice enough but i think he just didn't have support from managers, bartenders, or the kitchen.  Overall I would say this was one of the poorest restaurant experiences I've had in a while.  I would say avoid this place like the plague.  Too bad because it is convenient location with a good atmosphere.",

The shrimp was amazing..... then the filets came out ordered medium rare, but where we'll done, dry, flavorless. My girlfriends baked potatoe was cold, my mashed potatoes warm and very ordinary. Once we received our meal we didn't see the waiter for 30 mins...... we over heard the two tables around us complain about their meal. Restaraunt, view and staff where good, the food was far less than expected for the price. We could have went somewhere else and eaten a far better meal for 1/3 the price.

The fish was slightly overcooked and not as moist as it needed to be. But that wasn't the worst of it. It was completely tasteless. There was no flavoring on the fish at all except for the salsa and so you had to be sure you got a little bit of salsa in every bite and there wasn't that much. I had the rice on the side and it was good. For dessert we shared a Hot Chocolate Lava Cake. Again, it was okay. Since I make this at home and have had it other places it wasn't one of those \"you can't stop eating\" desserts. The cake is chocolatey enough but then they pour more over top which I thought was just too much. I also didn't like that they put nuts on it. The service was outstanding so I gave an extra star for that. Overall not a great meal and I wouldn't go back even with that most excellent view.",

    "text": "As many others have said, pretty substandard service.  Food was bland all around. They do target the retired crowd who probably aren't used to things like flavor and spice.   Your grandma from the midwest is in town? The one who says \"oh dear these bell peppers are too spicy\" - take her to Chart House.    Otherwise, there are many sophisticated kitchens with better service to be had. The chocolate cake appeared to be store-bought chocolate ice cream in the shape of a cake. That doesn't cut it in Scottsdale's culinary scene.  We generally had to wait almost an hour between courses.  I can excuse that for the entree course (which came to me at room temp), but we ordered the restaurant week menu.  Appetizers were cold dishes and likely pre-plated.  Why did it take an hour to get them out of the fridge?  The dining room wasn't exactly slammed.  The manager did notice that our table had stacks of dishes languishing on it, and grabbed a cook to help him clear it, so kudos there.    Waiter brought a large glass bottle of water and poured it for our table, when it ran out he was right back to start pouring another bottle.  Many modern restaurants commonly leave a glass carafe of water at your table these days - only Chart House charges you $7 per carafe.  At the end of the night we had at least $21 in charges for water just on me and my wife's tab.  Well, the slow service had us there for 3.5 hours, we did drink a lot of water.  It wasn't made clear to us that this was \"fancy water\", which we would of course have turned down for tap water.  We chose not to argue the point.  We had to work the next day and we no idea how long it would take to resolve. We decided to pay the $21 penalty to be able to leave quickly.  Things they did wrong -  Slow service. Bland food / lazy menu. Snuck in for-fee water. Happy hour only in the bar. Entree not hot. Poor value for the cost - meal for two was around $140, one can find better food and service at restaurants 1/2 the price. And we had the restaurant week menu, which should have been their \"best first impression\" offered at a discount.  Not getting one star because there were a few places they excelled.  Things they did right -  Cocktails inspired and unique.   Creme brulee was excellent, well-rounded and complex.   Restroom was clean. Great views of the lake. Kitchen ran out of \"restaurant week\" sized dessert, brought us a full size dessert.  They have ducks outside and free bread inside.  If you get too bored between courses, you could always take advantage of those facts to pass the time.",

NICK was a great waiter, very attentive and had some great suggestions for our meal. Everything from start to finish (another must have, chocolate lava cake with homemade ice cream!!!!)  Ended our night on a really positive note that there are still honest people in the world bc my hubby left his wallet at the table. We realized and went right back to the restaurant where the bus boy Juan had found it. Definitely a place to check out if you have not done so already. I recommend sitting on the outside patio with the fireplace, so perfect!",

    "text": "I don't know Scottsdale too well but I'm pretty sure there aren't many waterfront views in the city. The joke with Uber drivers when we pass a canal is that there's the waterfront living. Chart House is located close to a golf course and there's a big lake that this restaurant sits on. With this you get a beautiful view of both the golf course and this lake. There isn't much light pollution so if you have the opportunity to sit outside (heat permitting), do so, and enjoy the evening skies.  Immediately upon entering their private dining room, I was excited for the views and what was in store with dinner.  What didn't I love about Chart House?  - Salad bar. Legit.  - Fire roasted shrimp - I took two when people weren't paying attention. - The captain cut prime rib - OMG, so delicious. This cut is 14 oz and now represents two weeks of red meat in my life per doctor orders. I'm glad I used my lifeline with these folks. This was juicy and tender and packed with amazing flavors. - Asparagus served with my rib was great. It's worth adding mushrooms as an additional side, too. - Cheesecake - ya know, service was so stellar that I didn't order the cheesecake. The server heard me say how much I love cheesecake and brought it out for me. I was on another company's tab so I assumed there was a big budget for the night so any conversation on food was assumed that it was an order. In normal circumstances, I assume they would normally ask and confirm before bringing a dessert to you. In this case, I was ecstatic.  It's definitely a fancy restaurant but knowing how hot it gets in AZ you can go casual and not feel out of place. Our party was almost 20 folks and service was impeccable.   I hope to return to Chart House in the future.",

First off, they have a table right next to a stairs with high traffic, so I asked if we could be moved, no problem at all.  So, our wait person introduced himself as \"Bucky\". We looked at menu and then asked for the restaurant week menu, as we had never eaten there before.  Appetizers were okay, main dish was very nice and the deserts were nothing to write home about. Here's my biggest issue.  \"Bucky\" is as useless as tits on a bull, unless your at a table with 4 or more people, I guess he thinks bigger tip. Not one time during start to finish did he ask if  everything was okay. Terrible terrible service, he's in the wrong profession. Because of our experience, we won't eat their again or recommend to anyone. I had a better experience at a Jimmy John's",

    "text": "We had a horrible experience here last night. We had a 7:45 reservation for 4 of us. (Me, my husband, 2 year old and 1 year old) we got sat at 8:20. They were visibly behind, and the hostess was running around like crazy, but 1/2 the restaurant was empty tables. So not sure if they were short staffed or not. We finally get to the table. We are all hungry, and a little flustered for waiting so long, especially with little ones. Waitress came to take our drink order and we stated that we had already looked at menu and were ready to place our order. She returned with my drink, and my daughters drink, and 2 glasses of my husbands drink. We instantly thought that was probably a sign that she would not be returning. She brought us no bread, which would have been nice to distract my children with. After about 10 minutes she did return with bread, by this time I had drank my iced tea, my water, and my husbands water. She brought no refills. Our food finally came. My steak was ordered medium, it came medium rare, at max. I told her I wanted medium. She took it away, and told me I shouldn't have cut it up because they're going to throw a hat on it and quick cook it, I responded that I don't want it burnt. The manager returned with my steak, and then pointed out that my husband had 2 full glasses of his lemonade and I have nothing to drink, my steak was undercooked, and now it's charred and still rare. She asked me what I wanted, with quite an attitude. I said I came here to eat, and the entire experience has been terrible. She asked if I wanted my steak, I said no. Everyone at my table was done eating by now, she said she could get me coconut shrimp out fast, so I agreed to that. She returned a few minutes later with that, she then asked someone to get me a refill. Overall the shrimp was good, but I'd never return. Cooks can't cook and management can't manage. Steak pictured is after it was sent back, and cooked more, and charred.",

She asked us to take a seat in the waiting area so we did. About a minute after we sat down some other people came in too. Said they didn't have reservations either. The hostess gathered up  menus for them and immediately had them follow her to a table. As they walked by us one of the ladies apologized to us because they were being seated before us. We waited a bit more and the hostess came back to her station and then walked away again without speaking to us. We were confused as to what she was doing and left the restaurant.",

    "text": "Judging by the negative reviews, it appears Chart house is NOT what it used to be. We seem to have all the same complaints and Chart House has not responded to anybody NOR fixed its on going problems. My review will not matter or count because clearly Chart House does not care about reviews, hence their crappy customer service. Nevertheless, here it is. It has been about 6 years since I last visited The Chart House. I decided that this is where I'd like to return for Valentines Day 2018.  Plus, my husband has never been there. Since V-day falls during the week, we decided to celebrate on a weekend instead. I called and booked 2 WEEKS in advance, making sure we get in! It was a good thing we waited to celebrate because I ended up having the flu on Valentines Day.  Nevertheless, when I called to make reservations, the guy who answered didn't sound professional nor confident in what he was doing. I had peeked at the open table website to make sure the available times he gave me matched the website. 7:00 was the earliest they had available. We took it! 2 weeks later my husband and I got all dressed up and ready for our lovely dinner.  We were also hoping to request a window seat upon arrival. We get to the hostess station where a younger girl with long dark hair proceeds to tell me we have no reservation! Then, with a little help from her colleague she then tells us we were counted as a NO show because our reservations were at 5:45. I told her there was a mistake on their end and 5:45 was not even an option at the time I called. All she kept saying was sorry and there's nothing they can do. She suggested for us to sit at the bar, elbow to elbow with others, or we can wait until 9pm for the next available seat! I told her that is not an option and why should we have to pay for someone else's screw up? I was saving my appetite and had not eaten since 12:00 that day....there was NO way I was waiting until 9:00pm. She pretty much gave us the stank eye and sent us on our way. We ended up waiting for a small bar table in the bar area to open up.  I felt like a vulture stalking these poor people for their table lol. We literally stood there waiting for people to leave. This is something that the restaurant could have done for us at the least, instead of letting us flounder around.  Within 10 minutes a bar table opened up and we snagged it. At this point, I was already mad and didn't even want to be there. Unfortunately, all other restaurants near by were booked until 9pm as well.  To add insult to injury, the table was under my chin! I could have used a booster seat, since they only cater to tall people. As for the food....I got the shrimp and scallops, and it was about as ordinary as it comes. Nothing to shake a stick at! They had 1 bar tender for entire place, and yes it took awhile to get a drink. Our waiter was nice and tried to polish this tu** of a place the best he could. The place needs different management ASAP. They have NO structure, lack customer service skills, and have a bunch of lazy amateurs at the front desk who don't know how to push a button to make a reservation. Mark my words....this place doesn't have long before they close! It has all the signs.",

The food was terrible is all I can say, the service was slow and the salad bar was a big disappointment.  Shared the Mahi with my mother.  It was overcooked and dry.  Asked for a little extra sauce and was shocked that they charged me for it... considering they barely put enough on the plate of the initial serving.  We ordered a side of cream spinach.  Last time I checked creamed spinach should be creamy .... not dry and hard as a rock on the edges.  My father said he enjoyed his salmon but I know him well enough to know that he did not and from where I sat it did not look appealing.  The mashed potatoes on the side... also looked dry.  My brother's shrimp/pasta looked good and fresh.  Made me think his order was forgotten and they were trying to serve everything at the same time so ours waited under heat lamps.  Be wary of the salad bar.  The marinated artichokes looked good so I put some on my plate... but with one bite I could tell they were on the verge of going bad..had that \"fizzy just about to go bad\" taste. Spent over $170 on this meal and I feel it was wasted money.  I wont be going back.",

Also they are still serving clam chowder which is can based.  They did not have any specials last Friday night and said they are not offering nightly specials any longer.  The free range chicken was bland and boring and the chopped salads we ordered was nothing special.  The beef is still not organic or grass fed.  Wanted to order the Key Lime pie but this pie is not made in house but rather store bought.  Not a very good way to go for one of Landry's restaurants.  Very over priced for the quantity and quality of food.  We did enjoy feeding the bread to the ducks afterwards....We will not be back thought we would try again after a few years but they are going down hill.   Nice views...",

So bad that a sane person would have avoided this poor excuse for a seafood restaurant (but I went anyway...MISTAKE). Most of the poor reviews were due to sub-standard service.  My experience?  The service was HORRIFICALLY bad.  Waited unreasonably long for drink order to be taken.  Waited unreasonably long for drinks to arrive.  Was able to sneak in an appetizer order for calamari when drinks finally arrived.  Waited unreasonably long for calamari to arrive.  Surprised?  Calamari was fair at best.  When the appetizer arrive I finally placed the dinner order.  I ordered the prime rib...rare.  My dinner guest ordered some type of fish.  Guess what took unreasonably long?  Yes, the dinner orders.  As a matter of fact, after waiting unreasonably long for dinner to arrive, someone came to the table to let me know they ran out of rare cuts of prime rib, but they could do medium rare.  So I said that would be fine.  What they brought literally looked like over-cooked pot roast.  It was beyond well-done...it was dry.  The fish that my guest ordered was tough and fishy (smelling and tasting). This place has become a joke.  Do yourself a favor and AVOID the disappointment.  If you're up for seafood stick to the Mastro's restaurants.  They've got a recipe for success and always please.",

I made reservations for 7:30, we arrived there at 7:15. The hostess said we would be seated closer to 7:30 and that was fine. So we sat in the bar... and sat... and sat some more. It was almost 8 till we were finally seated. I saw people walk in get seated shortly after but not us and it was just a party of four. Finally get seated then ordered more drinks.. that took awhile... ordered an appetizer and that took awhile.... then the soup comes out AND that takes awhile... finally our entrees didn't come out till 9:14.. (I was checking my watch then) so we didn't leave the restaurant till 10... I thinking they were really lacking waiters. If the hostess seated us at the time I made reservations then it wouldn't have been so bad. But eating so late leaves awfuly bloated. Ok ok, now the good part. This is one of the best seafood restaurants I've been to in Arizona. It's fresh and delicious. I didn't have the salad bar, but it looked really really good. They have a good wine list and the apps are good too. We were way too stuffed to try the lava cake, but there's always next time. Just make reservations an hour earlier, ha!",

He brought us water and bread while our meal was being prepared.  The food was excellent and hot when served.  We had the signature dessert which was decadent and wonderful.  Watched the sun set over Camelback mountain while eating a relaxed meal.  The waiter did an excellent job of balancing service without interrupting our intimate dining experience.

When entrees returned they were pretty tasteless. We were not charged for my entree and dessert, but the manager's apologies were lackluster. The ambiance is nice but for the cost of the restaurant we were extremely disappointed in the quality of the food.",

We have also been here a couple of other times. Each time it's been good. But last night was horrible.  1. I order an old fashion, the first one directly from the bar was perfect. The one I ordered from our waitress, was just bourbon on the rocks. When asked to adjust, it came back as watered down bourbon.  2. Upon ordering, we were told after the fact they were out of clam chowder. I heard walking to the salad bar that waitresses and waiters were running around cancelling orders. For a $40 a plate dinning experience the chef should have been more on top of this.  3. When I made it to the salad bar, they were out of many items, no one manning it and lettuce was brown. 4. Finally after getting our food, the food runner brought out one plate at a time. Now there were 8 of us so we had to wait 2 minutes between each plate.  5. After being served my Scallops and Shrimp, which at one time were much bigger, were cold/Luke warm. Which made them horrible. 6. Desert was \"okay\".  I've always enjoyed this place and happy to eat there but this time almost makes me not want to go back. I may give them one more chance. This was on a Sunday and the restaurant was not very busy.  I hope they get this fixed.",

What a mess...first of all we got there early for our 8:45 reservations...finally got seated at 9:15...then we waited...server finally came around and dropped off some tasty bread.  I asked for a Blue Moon and he said he didn't think they had any left...my Dad ordered a dos eques...again they didnt have that...so i went with water and they did have Heineken.  I ordered two of the shrimp cocktail and calamari appetizer...which was excellent.  That took forever to show up as well.  Then comes the issues with the main course....My order came out wrong, my dads original order of Prime Rib, they ran out of but weren't told about it until well past 10:15, so he ordered the larger filet, which came out  smaller than my daughters small filet...my dads filet was luke warm at best and potatoes were actually cold, my daughters filet and potatoes were in the same temp range...really unfortunate, since the cuts of meat were great and done perfectly.  Our server was completely overwhelmed and was attempting to do his best, but in the end, everything put together made for a horrible experience...we informed the waiter of our dissatisfaction with everything...Our bill was over $300...when we left, i purposefully walked past the manager, and he wouldn't even acknowledge me...he had walked past out table a couple tomes previously, and I guess i expected at least some sort of acknowledgement from a manager of what this type of restaurant is attempting to be...what they could be, what they are pretending to be, has nothing to do with what we experienced on Christmas Eve...",

We had a gift card that they upsold us on the last time we were here and they failed to tell us that you practically need a urine sample in order to be able to use it.

But for some reason it took 15 minutes and 4 hostesses to seat us. We waited for our server Bucky to arrive and then felt a bit rushed to get our orders in. He talked at us like a pirate. All you could see out the window was the bright reflection of the glaring bar lights. So much for a window seat upon the lake.  Then the food came. It was delicious! I never realized that a caesar salad could be dressed up to taste this good. And the macadamia nut crusted shrimp was THE best ever. Sooo good! Yum! My date enjoyed his prime rib although it was extra fatty. He also reports that the clam chowder was only average.   Dessert became a problem. We were informed that they were all out of creme brulee. This was a major disappointment since this drew us to their restaurant week menu. The server was also unwilling to substitute a different desert item from the regular menu. Bad call. In the end, our server surprised us with the last creme brulee and it was soggy, mushy, and cold.  Sad face.  We overheard another table complaining to the manager about the slip up with their reservations too. Service makes a difference, folks. We walked away loving the meal but unimpressed with the disjointed experience altogether. For the price, I just won't be trying this spot again.",

    "text": "They say, you can never go home, or go back. Well, I've never bought into that.   Over the years, we've been in almost a dozen or so Chart Houses. Sadly, many have closed due to whatever corporate reorg was going on at the time. I miss the ones in Steamboat and Newport, RI the most. Great locations and views.   So it was with some excitement that we made reservations here for Easter Sunday dinner. Surprisingly, we have never been to this location.  We arrived a few minutes before six and found our hostess in a middle of a hiccups fit. I offered to frighten her but she decline. I guess I was scary enough. LOL  There was also some confusion over our reservations, but it didn't last long. We were escorted to our table, over by the window with a magnificent view of the lake. You got to give Chart House credit for choosing some great locations!  We started with a glass of Merlot and Pinot each. Both were very good for house wines. We also opted for the salads, the warm bacon dressing was delicious, as was the Caesar.  Things started slowly declining from here. I asked about getting their Callahan Prime Rib End Cut ($33.99). Seems the kitchen couldn't make up their minds if they had one.   First it was no, then yes and finally surprise, they delivered a regular cut. It was tasteless with no flavor at all. When we were paying I mentioned it to our server, all they could say was, \"oh yeah.\"  Grrr. LOL. The other entree was their Beef Tenderloin Medallions ($31.99) which was very good.   For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake to share with some coffee. It came damaged and somewhat of a mess. LOL. See our photo, versus the Chart House one. Our waiter apologized saying they should have been picked it up sooner. (Okay, why didn't you bring us another one?).   The current owners of Chart House is Landry, a very classy and sharp organization.  I would suggest they work on this location before they need to close this one too.   Our bill, including two glasses of wine ran us $80.00 a person, including taxes and gratuities.   Now why didn't we go to Capital Grill I wonder?  Well, maybe next time.  For a positive review of a Chart House, I call your attention to my friend Norm's recent experience in Las Vegas. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/forte-european-tapas-bar-and-bistro-las-vegas?hrid=Gpo-2lh59Bru8sKqgRm5Hw\">yelp.com/biz/forte-europ...</a>",

I waited for my food because I was hungry, but when it came  there was no apologies & my waiter had an attitude almost. I believe my black skin bothered them for reasons unknown to me even though my demeanor was pleasant, optimistic, and patient not to mention I was dressed in professional clothing. I was told Scottsdale was an upscale area,  but racism is rampant in this city and this restaurant is one out of my many experiences over the week stay.

My girlfriend Kristen and I found it quite enjoyable too hahah!  Look at the photos; it was the only table in the corner facing the 'waterfront' with two walls of windows.    I highly recommend the bacon/spinach chopped salad!!! Yumyum!  I don't recommend the small salad bar for $16.99!!!! I do want to try their Cesar salad, it looks quite delicious.  I don't recommend the soup sampler...save your self the hassle and just order a full bowl of the lobster bisque or the clam chowder.    The Calamari is called Calamari & Friends...get it without the friends!  It comes with fried vegetables mixed-in (carrots, peppers etc).  I personally like my veggies fresh, not fried and my calamari lonely with lemon :) They did accommodate my preference when I asked for plain, lightly breaded and fried calamari.  And they did not over fry it to death like many places do in the valley.    I have eaten at Chart House a few times with my friend Kristen and she has gotten the crab cake every time, so I think it is safe to assume it is delicious!  I have had many of their fish dishes (halibut, mahi mahi, and salmon) and all have been good.  Nothing particularly stood out, but it was all great to eat which is why I come back.  Good seafood can be a rough find in the desert.    Service here is a bit dicey, you never know what you are going to get, some are better than others.  I also always feel like they are trying to hard sell me on more food, which annoys me.  Many times when I opt for seafood I am trying to eat 'lighter' and I don't need somebody hounding me to eat a four course meal.    I have had the lava cake here once and I give it two thumbs up!  It is quite large for a lava cake too so you can definitely share....if you want :)    As for location, obviously other Chart Houses are on the beach and have amazing locations, but for Scottsdale I guess it is as close to 'waterfront' as you can get!",

    "text": "After waiting overnight to recover from our dining experience I've decided that the performance by the Chart House was so poor that I had to comment.   Upon arriving to a restaurant that was less than 1/2 full we were asked to wait about 10 minutes to be seated so they could make sure the servers weren't too busy.  This should have been our first warning.   After being seated it became clear that they were terribly understaffed as it took another 10 minutes for a server to come over to tell us she'd be with us soon (another 5-10 minutes).  Recognizing a full dinner would likely be a three hour affair,  we ordered 1 bowl of soup and two small salads.  The soup came out pretty quickly,  but the salads took nearly 1/2 hour to arrive,  and then only after I flagged down our server who we hadn't seen since she took our order.   The chopped salad was more like an onion salad,  but we knew asking for something else would only make things worse. We didn't see our server again until we had already been finished for 10 minutes.   We asked for the check,  immediately gave our credit card,  only for our server to disappear once again.  Finally,  I had to give chase simply to pay.   When I spoke with the manager about our experience there seemed to be a mixed expression of recognition,  apology and helplessness.   Was quite odd that there seemed to be plenty of time for all the servers to repeatedly push Landry dining club memberships,  but not enough to serve the guests in a timely manner.   As a return guest I was surprised by how poor the experience was.  Seems to have been a trend over the last few visits. While we probably will return in the future,  Chart House is unfortunately out of our regular dining rotation.",

Two of had great prime rib, cooked medium as requested,garlic mashed potatoes in a pretty mound decorated with carrot curls, and delicious sizzled mushrooms.   If you have an entree, their very good salad bar is $9.00 extra, or just the salad bar with no entree is $18.00.Two others had just the salad bar(salads and fruits) and were happy with it.  My dessert of vanilla homemade ice cream with caramel syrup was delish.  I had requested extra caramel syrup and the lovely waitress brought me a side dessert dish with extra. The view is beautiful - mountains, a lake, the service is white tablecloths and well dressed wait staff.  I can only find good things to say about The Chart House. There is also a bar lounge there.",

    "text": "Great experience  dining here. From the moment my date and I walked in, I was greeted and treated like royalty. They catered to every need and attempted to find a great window seat indoors. As they checked we sat at the elegant bar they have there and had a drink while we waited a short 3 minutes or so. When the hostess came back we were presented with two options!!  A seat near a window with a lake view or a table outside above the lake (which we chose) which was very nice, romantic and private as we ended up being the only guests outside on their outdoor seating.   The food was great! We ordered a mixed scallops dish, lobster tail, lobster bisque, oysters and  asparagus - we finished every bit of it.   Chart house has a great selection of red wine specifically and the wine bottle we didn't finished - they allowed us to cork it and take it home with us as we had other alcoholic beverages we had ordered and felt tipsy enough with.  The waiter was very attentive , but did tend to talk an extended time when he would do so.... I think he liked the eye candy I had with me ;)  All in All, this is a great, classy and clean restaurant to come to. The cost was a bit up there, but was expected. If I remember correctly, the bill was a little over $200.00  If your looking for a good seafood menu, this is a place to come .  Sit outside by the lake (around 9pm or later of course as it is hot during summer) as you will also have views of Camelback Mt. as well.  P.S. - their dessert is phenomenal too! :)",

The server Nick was great, had that Vin Diesel look going. His attention to detail was impecable.  When we first arrived of course we went to the bar, and we all sat comfortably as we waited for the rest of our party. Our bartender was a dead ringer for Dennis Farina. The drinks were perfect, not too much alcohol and not watered down. We then were sat, and then ordered our meals. I had the lobster bisque which was very tasty until I got some dirt in my soup. It happens, but it did put a damper on the overall feeling. I then ordered the Filet and Lobster tail. I should have gone with the Prime Rib instead. The steak was a bit overdone for me, maybe having sat just a bit too long, and was really quite small for me. I think it was only a zix ounce portion. The lobster was done correctly. I also had the sizzling mushrooms, and to be honest button mushrooms on a sizzling fajita plate just didn't do it for me.  The service for me is what made this a three star, not the food or the ambiance.",

I was excited to see oysters on the menu, but when they came out it was a different story.  The majority of the oysters were so dry and sticky, that they resembled chewed gum.  Only one shell had the liquid expected of a freshly shucked oyster; however, one smell and you knew they were inedible.  They offered to replace our oysters but we declined.  Because of my boyfriend's birthday we had a table that was specifically labeled VIP, but we were never touched by a manager, even after the oyster fiasco. We eagerly awaited our entrees, unfortunately my boyfriends birthday dinner of salmon and potatoes was drier than our Saguaro desert.  I'm not sure if our server was in the weeds or if they were lacking support staff, but the quality of food and service was worth half what we paid.",

I'll be back, but it will be hard to order something other then the spectacular prime rib. I don't know that I'd call this place a \"happenin' place,\" but, seriously, if you're in the mood for outstanding red meat, I came away very impressed. Service was competent.

I made a reservation and told them it was my wife's birthday. When we arrived the hostess wished my wife a happy birthday and she gave us specially printed happy birthday menus.  Nice touch.  She also asked us if we wanted to be seated or if we'd like to wait about 5 minutes and get a table overlooking the water.  That was a no-brainer.  For appetizers I had the calamari (delicious!) and my wife had their New England clam chouder (also delicious!).  Main courses were Mediterranean Shrimp for me and Shrimp/Linguini for my wife.  We tasted each other's meal - both were very good but I liked the Mediterranean Shrimp better.  For dessert we shared their chocolate lava cake.  This concoction has about 2,000 calories per spoonful but it's worth the extra 10 hours you'll spend in the gym. Overall this was a wonderful meal.  I took a star off for the so-so waiter service.",

It was simply 3 cocktail tables pushed together and still set for 4 at each. The silver wear was left on even though those settings were in places where no one could sit. Our son had to sit on the crack in between 2 of the small tables and had nowhere to put his food. When I asked the host if they had a table more suitable for a party of 7, I was tole that people who had come earlier for those large tables. If we made reservations two months in advance, I would think a table would be set aside for us. It was very disappointing and took away from our dinner since it was difficult to make eye contact around the cocktail tables. I was even more disappointed to discover this is a Landry restaurant. We eat at Mastros often and have never had this issue. Needless to say, we would not recommend this restaurant to our friends of family.",

Then, I opted for the Mixed Seafood Grill (grilled citrus salmon, shrimp scampi & a jumbo lump crab cake, served with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes & asparagus). Holy moly! There was so much food but it all tasted so delicious and was so flavorful! My favorite though would definitely have to be the shrimp scampi!  We couldn't end the night without trying their dessert, that they sneakily talk you into when taking your order. The Hot Chocolate Lava Cake takes 30 minutes to make, so you have to order it when you order your food... and let me tell you, it was definitely worth every calorie! Such a yummy, chocolately goodness!  I will say that this place is pretty pricey, so I wouldn't go often. But definitely worth it for a nice evening out! I would definitely go back!",

Was told we would have patio seating. Called to confirm our reservation one hour before, and was told they had booked a special party so we would not get a patio table. Will we get a window? No, your party is too large but we will put you at the next row from the window. Arrived on time for our 5:30 reservation, mentioned our disappointment to the front, and we were seated FIVE rows from the window. Made no fuss, but did call the manager today, reported the above and was told we never should have been promised any table...seating is first come first served.  Just realized there was an empty table our size in the second row, which was not filled until well after our arrival! Service was also lacking: for example--no serving utensils for shared appetizers, and other minor errors not expected at a restaurant of this expense. Reported all this to the manager, and was \"invited to come again\". When I asked what that meant, he said \"you will be served as you should be served\". I told him I expected to be served as I should be served without an invitation!  Thanked him for his time and told him we are unlikely to be back, even though we are moving close to the restaurant next month. This was our fifth visit to the Chart House, each time hoping for a bit better.  Likely it will be our last. BTW, beware of the constant attempts to upsell.  \"Would you like sauce with that?\"  \"Order your hot desert before you order dinner because it takes a long time to cook\" and on and on!",

The shrimp pasta & prime rib was under seasoned. The best part of the meal was the lava cake. Basic but delicious. Kind of disappointed. Had high expectations once we pulled up & walked in. The hostess was very engaging & made us feel welcomed. Taylor our waitress was good & attentive",

The presentation of the food was spot on and not a single drop off. The service was not bad, our servers name was Eva and she was sweet and kudos for her serving 7 people. You get what you pay for in every situation. But you will not be disappointed when coming here, it's very upscale and romantic",

The hostess working, I'm assuming she was the manager, was extremely rude and unprofessional. I walked up to the hostess stand to check in for my reservation at 6:30 and waited for 5 minutes before even being greeted. She then told me to hold on for a minute to seat other guests, then came back to the hostess table and helped quite literally everyone else in line behind me. It took about 15 minutes of me standing there for her to finally address me and check my party in for our reservation. She told me they were running about 30-45 minutes behind on reservations on Valentine's Day. We left and took our business elsewhere, however I received a notification at 7:35 that our reservation had been canceled. An hour and 5 minutes is a ridiculous wait for someone who had a reservation weeks in advance for a party of 2. Mainly because of how I was treated by the very unprofessional hostess that night, I will not be coming back. Shockingly poor customer service.",

We came before our reservation so we could have drinks in the bar first. 4 of us... waited 15 minutes to be given a menu. Slow service. Drinks and apps were good, though.   Asked front desk if our table was ready (we had told them we were there) 5 minutes after the reservation. Still not ready. Said it would be 15 minutes! Got us in to a nice table in 5 minutes, however. Waited forever for menus AGAIN. Very slow service.   The chopped spinach salad was delicious, the macadamia topped fish was overcooked, steaks were average. Everything took so long, even to get a water glass refilled or another beer. The explanation was that servers were new and that there was a \"17 top.\"  Sorry, you need to be prepared if you have a large group coming in. Won't return unless just for happy hour.",

I had the artichoke and my companion had the hummus. They were ok. Dinner course was very disappointing. We had the macadamia but crusted chicken. The chicken was over cooked and very dry. And it came with a mound of rice and no vegetables. Apparently the restaurant wants you to pay $6 more for the salad buffet. Dessert was the best. I had the line habanero ice cream and my companion had the mud pie. When all was said and done it wasn't worth the $135 we spent (drinks, taxes and tip included). The service, however, was superb. Our server was great the bar manager was rude. We ordered drinks from the bar during happy hour before we were seated. We were going to transfer the drink cost to our final bill but the bar manager wouldn't let us. I wonder if they thought we were trying to get free drinks??? I handed the bill to the hostess and asked her to have it transferred and the bartender chased us down and demanded payment. It was embarrassing and rude. We won't be back.",

It does overlook a man made lake in McCormick Ranch and the water view is a nice change of pace for us desert rats.  The food and service has been hit and miss over the past few years ranging from pretty good to disasterous.  I can honestly say this was the site of one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in Arizona.  I've been back since and things were improved... they couldn't have gotten any worse.  The fact that it's near my house and I may go there twice a year says it all.  It really has the potential to become a neighborhood favorite if management ever got a clue.",

The setting is beautiful although we were seated far from the seats with a view. Our server started out strong with a wine suggestion that we all enjoyed. My shrimp entree was delicious. My mother-in-law found that her crab cakes were overwhelmed by the accompanying vegetables. But, my husband 's experience was terrible. He ordered the flounder which was the special. It arrived undercooked and cold. When our server finally returned to check on us, my husband asked that she take his dish to the kitchen and microwave it to warm it up. She took it away and didn't return for at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile his mother and I finished our meals. By the time his entree returned, his appetite was gone and he had them just box it up to take home. When we got the check we found that the special was $10 more than the already outrageous prices of other fish entrees. Our check was about $60 per person. We will never be back. There are just too many great, reasonably priced restaurants in the valley to put up with overpriced, mediocre food.",

Entrees took over an hour to get to our table which would have been OK had the waiter kept us updated and bothered to show his face at our table (but he couldn't be bothered).  He walked by many times to serve everyone around us, but ignored our table.  Someone from our table had to go hunt the waiter down 3 times to get service.  I guess the waiters at this place are allowed to discriminate!    When the food arrived it was not worth the wait.  I didn't even finish it.  The harried-looking manager offered us a free dessert, but we were so mad at the bad service we got our check and left. WILL NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!!!",

The staff was rude and the food was not worth the price. It started with the host telling us that the patio was closed, even though we called at 3:30 earlier to verify we could have patio seating at 7:30. Did I mention that it is march in Phoenix and 75 degrees. Reluctantly, we were sat on the patio but the server made sure we paid for his inconvenience. He had to open an extra door. Every question or request was met with a snappy comment. We end up asking for a new server and the manager was mildly sympathetic. We would have left right away if we were not with other dinner guests and very hungry. They brought one of our guests the wrong meal and the food was good but not great. Over priced in my opinion. That being said the discounted our $300.00 bill by $75. I don't plan to go back anytime soon. If you choose to go here, good luck.",

When I was back in high school, this guy would always promise that he would take me to the Chart House is Redondo/Hermosa Beach if I ever gave him the chance.  Well, I never did, but then I started dating a guy and he took us here for our...wait for it...one month anniversary.  I know, totally lame, but when you're in high school one month seems like a ridiculously long time!  So we go there all dressed up and looking cute, and we don't even make it to the bread because my date is puking in the bathroom.  The waiter thought my date abandoned me because my date was with me for all of two seconds.  So needless to say I didn't get the full Chart House experience. Fast forward to 11 months later, and he takes to the one in Scottsdale for our one year anniversary.  The food was delicious and the setting was as cute as it can be for living in the dessert.  We even got to see the geese kick the ass out of the ducks for food that was laying out there.  This place is a standard, upscale, romantic restaurant.  I like more off the beaten path places, but this place is always a safe bet.",

Waited 5 minutes for water, 25 minutes for appetizer. 4. another 30 minutes for entrees. 5. Half the food was luke warm the other half had been microwaved or heat lamped or something since it was dried out. 6. Lobster portion was skimpy. 7. This place has premium prices, even though a chain, has been in business for many years and they are being run by a bunch of accountants. Other chains like Ruth Chris, etc do a pretty good job; this place is awful and has no clue.  I complained to mgr., since waitress was hopeless....comped meal and don't even care! I would have refused to pay for entrees. And I have never done that in 40 years of dining out. Never. Oh...last nice touch...1st 2 items we ordered they were out of...Mother's day, sea bass and scallops, out?   How hard is it to plan since you know you have a full house but accountants are in charge of ordering so they just say \"let them order somethng else.\" They'll stay in business though...nice location, preying on unsuspecting tourists....sad. If you go you derve what you get!",

    "text": "From me, the Chart House gets 5 stars for location and ambience, both of which are very sadly lacking here in Scottsdale.  Unfortunately, what is also lacking in Scottsdale is quality, and the Chart House suffers a little from that as well.   That is not to say that the food isn't good.  It is.  But it isn't something you will rave about.  But get a waterfront table in the evening when the candles are burning, have a martini, and enjoy the salad bar if nothing else!  The nicest overall experience in the area.  Update:  I returned to the Chart House about a year after this review.   And while it still retains a wonderful atmosphere and good service, I do have to agree with many recent reviewers that the prices are now out-of-line with the quality of the food.   $30-$40 for a very basic seafood dish, and $16.00 for a nothing-special salad bar, are beyond the quality they are providing.  Further Update:  07/15/12:   Leave it to Landry's to destroy another fine dining establishment.   For 20 years I've looked forward to visiting The Chart House in many cities.   But it is now just another chain establishment, and with each visit, it slides downhill.   I must shed a tear and move on.  RIP Chart House.",

Needless to say I still enjoyed coming here.  There was a great view with tons of wildlife all around the lake.  I saw a bunny, pegged some bread at some geese in the lake, and fed the coi fish there too.   The menu again was preset so I didnt really get the full experience of dining here.  But I loved the first date mood lighting enjoyed by me and my training instructors, quite romantic.

SURELY they should understand that if you go to a high-end restaurant you don't expect to be thinking about getting coupons and discounts at 10pm on a Friday night after a relaxing meal!",

The restaurant was clean and had a great ambiance. The girl that was assisting our server was very sweet and did great.  Now the bad, our server was Bob, and he was rude from the beginning. He rolled his eyes when I asked if my party of three could be on a separate check. The same response occurred when I asked him to put my mother's birthday cake in the kitchen until desert. So, the prices here are high, but we expected this. When our food arrived it was cold, and my brother's $37 sea bass was also over cooked. Then, my sister ordered her after dinner cappacino and Bob says under his breath \"I don't have time for this.\"  We made sure that Bob's tip reflected his attitude and level of service. So, needless to say the experience was disappointing, but we still enjoyed each other.",

The food was good not over the top however the seafood was fresh Clam Chowder good again not great however the biggest disappointment was the salad bar which lists for $15.99 unless you purchase an entree then they try to make you feel as if its a bargain by adding it for $7.99. I would have no problem with the exuberant price but please give me something impressive this was a real let down. I would highly recommend reservations and try to specify a window seat as the views will impress and motivate your palate. Price of dinner with no wine just ice water was $107.00 with 20% tip so anticipate a much larger bill with cocktails. Wine list is impressive and this is a wonderful place to take a date if you love flaming torches and views over the lake again just make sure you get the window seat.",

Don't get me wrong, we have our haunts that we like to go to quite a bit.  When it comes to new places I am a little scared.  We went to Chart House on Mothers Day, busiest day in the restaurant land.  My mother wanted to go.  My 70 year old father likes the \"salad bar\" at the Chart House.  I figured we were going to a \"senior\" joint and fortunately we were not going to spend a lot of money.  I was wrong on both ends.  The location is wonderful.  It's on a man made lake/pond thing which gives the customer a wonderful view.  For a moment I felt I was out of the dessert.  The decor was nice.  on to food.  THEY WERE OUT OF EVERYTHING.  I wanted prime rib, no prime rib.  I wanted ono, they were out of ono.  I got the Asian Seared Tuna with a wasabi cream sauce.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was a wonderful cut of tuna, no fat on it.  The sauce was INCREDIBLE.  It had a kick, if you like don't spicy, this is not for you.  I can't remember what my wife and mom ordered.  I know my dad had a steak and it looked and tasted good but I would never order it here.  You can get a better steak somewhere else.  This is more of a seafood joint.  The salad bar was unique and very up class.  They make ceaser salads fresh for you.  Anchovies are available.  You can build your own salad which has many unique toppings to choose from.  The icing on the cake was the caviar.  Lots and lots of caviar.  My dad and I had maybe 3 plates of caviar.    Overall the value is good for a $$$$ dinner.  It was nice to take my parents there on a special day.  If I were to go back, I would just get the salad bar.  It's not cheap on it's own, but cheaper than the entrees.  The selection is top notch.",

The coconut crunchy shrimp was very good, but not too much different from other coconut shrimp we've had.  The mud pie dessert was also very good!  Our server was very good, but there was a point in time where our drinks were empty for a few minutes....not much time, but still, I always feel like a drink should never sit empty for any amount of time.  My water also didn't get filled until right before we were about to leave.  But overall, we still very much enjoyed our meal and our server was very friendly and mostly attentive.

    "text": "I'm definitely not the type of person who likes to give merely 1 star... but after my experience here, it's hard to give it anything more.  The only thing going for it really was the view... too bad though that it was too dark to see the water.  We went here for my birthday dinner a few nights ago.  Walked in, nice decor, but were greeted by the smirk of a man who was looking down his nose at us - especially since we didn't have a reservation.  The place wasn't busy... maybe half full, if that.  We waited patiently for about 20 minutes to be seated.  The waitress was... somewhat polite; I mean, she did try to cater her suggestions to her audience.  I'm Japanese, but you know... just because I am doesn't mean that you need to suggest all the Asian dishes as specialties.  She did the same racial profiling to the table next to us of Italians.  While I understand her meaning behind it and I'm sure she didn't mean to be offensive, I just found it odd.  Unfortunately, she also didn't know anything at all about the wines, but I made a selection we enjoyed anyhow.   We ordered the calamari as the app and it came out cold.  I personally have never enjoyed cold fried items, but hey that's me.  I'm not all that sure how long it had been sitting in the window, but since it took about 30 minutes to arrive at the table I assume a while.  The whole night it felt as though our waitress was avoiding us since the calamari sat nearly untouched for at least 15 minutes until she came by with my friend's clam chowder soup.  The soup he said was good, but I found it slightly inexcusable that she kept walking past our table and looking at the untouched appetizer whilst she continued to service the table next to us to her fullest extent. For our entrees, he ordered shrimp 3 ways and I ordered a simple shrimp and crab pasta.  His was overcooked to the point of rubber and mine made me feel ill immediately after consumption.  We both decided to skip out on desserts due to the awful service and poor food quality.    One thing that upsets me is when a restaurant ruins its ingredients and this one did.  Go for the soup and nothing else.  If you expect even a smidgen of decent service, don't even bother. It's over priced and pretentious for food that is improperly prepared.  Before exiting the establishment I had to excuse myself in order to \"go bulimic\" and my friend felt incredibly sick the next day.  Stomachs beware!",

What I recall is the steak, which he ordered, not I.  There was this dipping sauce, melt-in-your-mouth butter concoction that gave the already flavorful, soft steak an even greater kick. The ahi tuna was also tasty.  Being from Maryland, I appreciate a good riparian view. Atmosphere supersedes food for me at times. Chart House was right up my alley (not that their food isn't equally on par with the views).  A thumbs up in my book.",

We said thank you and gave signs it was time for her to leave.           Then our waiter pushed the cocktails when we ordered a beer and martini  and then he tried again  later heard the waiters talking near our sections about some contest for drink orders.   But this place charges too much for the Applebee's style service.    Anyways the Prime Rib was good  but how do you mess that up when you have Lawry's in your name...     the fish was ewwwww and the rest was forgetable.     Save you Money and go Somewhere else.     The only thing worth a star is the View.    Staff was Awful and worthless.     Hopefully they close this place and put in a another concept, in that great location.",

We enjoyed our dinner very much. Those that had the Ahi Tuna app loved it! I had the New England clam chowder. It was a bit thinner that I would have liked but my other table diners loved it. The crab cakes were GREAT! Super chunky real crab pieces. The creme brulee for dessert was also really really tasty.   They seated us near the lake view so that was nice. We had fun and are avid seafood lovers. For a place meant for older peeps, this was a pretty good experience!",

The dinner was fine.  The dessert was fine.  When they took the dessert dishes away, including the leaf garnish, there was something black on the table cloth.  And it MOVED.  It was some kind of SLUG!!!!  it was on the dessert!  Probably on the leaf.  We alerted an employee.  The manager (I think) came over.  We did not get any compensation for how disgusted my friends and I felt.  I think I threw up in my mouth a little just now reliving this horrifying experience.  They should've at least covered the dessert.  Actually, covering the entire meal may not have been enough either.  What if one of us ATE the slug?  GROSS!!!",

    "text": "We were recent guests at this restaurant. Diplomatically, I don't remember being more offended by the quality of our food. Mercifully, I can only recall that I had scallops which were flabby and tasteless, presented on a bed of mashed potatoes with a side of asparagus that was smothered in a horrible cream sauce. How do you make asparagus uneatable? An appetizer of lobster bisque was heavy and lacked any resemblance to a quality composition. It made me think of Campbell's creamed tomato soup. The ubiquitous and much encouraged lava cake was an uninteresting throwback to the 50s, as was the tired decor of the room. I couldn't even drown my sorrow in a decent glass of wine. Congratulations, Chart House, on presenting one of the most thoughtless wine lists I've encountered, which is saying something, since most wine lists are poorly constructed. The featured Rodney Strong Sauvignon blanc was an over oaked mess. Whatever my wife ordered, and took away in a doggie bag, went straight into the garbage can when we got home. And the prices! Holy Mother of God, this place ain't cheap. At least I wasn't paying, but I felt sorry for the poor sap who was. Service was polite and pedestrian, if not a bit pushy on their apparent signature dishes. Well, I'm signing off on this joint.",

Service was a bit slow to start, most likely due to the table next to us that had pair that had apparently been drinking for several hours and were doing a good job of causing the server a case of heartburn.  Once they left, service leaped forward and was fine for the rest of the evening.  The salad bar was good as was the fish.",

    "text": "Valentines Day Massacre! We had a 7PM reservation and arrived 30 minutes early with the intent to have a few drinks at the bar before we were sat. On arrival we were told they were 30 minutes behind. Somewhat understandable and my wife and I were ok with it.  We fortunately found 2 seats at the bar but then waited 20 minutes before being acknowledged. There was only one bartender and he focused on doing table drinks only. There was a full bar and none of us got service until we pinned down this poor bar back. There was a woman behind the bar as well, who appeared to be management but all she did was wash glasses. So this poor kid started making drinks and serving those of us that hadn't been served. We asked the woman if they had a sick call or short staffed and she glibly answered \"no.. normal Thursday staffing\"... she couldn't give a crud about service.  We were finally sat an hour late. The server was prompt but drinks took forever at the table, which we expected coming from the bar we had watched implode. My wife ordered the salad bar and it was out of everything. She had to ask the same poor kid behind the bar to get more lettuce.  When our meals arrived, which also took a ridiculous amount of time, they were cold.  We asked for the manager and it turned out to be a regional manager who was there trying to fix ongoing issues. We had seen him at a number of tables already and knew he was having a bad night.  We went easy on him but it was a horrible dining experience. The manager did comp the entire meal.  We have been here and had a lovely time but this time was an absolute joke.  I want to go back...but reading the reviews it looks like they still have problems.",

The Bruschetta Board was fantastic with eggplant caponata, roasted red pepper hummus and other savory spreads, grilled wild mushrooms, artichoke & tomatoes with plenty of grilled bread to lather it all on. The spinach and artichoke dip was healthy and delicious. Sliders were excellent with plenty of au jus. Portions are generous, staff is friendly and attentive. So very glad we drove by..",

The place has a great view of the lake and it was so gorgeous to see from our window seats we were given once we got there.  Our server was so sweet and helpful with suggestions.  First business of order was to get our drinks.  The hubby and I ordered cocktails, he got the margarita which he says was very refreshing. I got the bourbon & chocolate and it was made just right and got me relaxed and ready to enjoy my meal after a long hot day in the sun.  We all for waters for the table and those glasses were kept topped off throughout the entire meal which is always a win with me. We share a crab cake appetizer for the table.  I think we all wished we got our own once we tasted it.  It was so good and one of the best ones we have had in a very long time!   I ordered the Shrimp & scallops pantagonia, mom in love got the Short ribs and gnocchi, hubby and mini me both got the prime rib meals.  We also ordered a creamed spinach dish for the table to share too with our main entrees.  We got complimentary bread as well and that was hobbled up by all of us.  It was very good obviously that I forgot to take a picture of it.  Our food arrived all at once and we all sampled each other's food and I personally liked everything everyone got!  I do admit the prime rib is to die for.  It was so good that my hubby couldn't stop talking about it three days later!!  This place will definitely be on list to come back when we are in the area which will be frequent now that we have some folks we know staying out here.  We still had some room for dessert which we all shared the lava cake. Omg that thing was huge!!  I mean it was meant for more than four people to share.  It was so good and a nice way to end the meal but we couldn't even finish the entire cake though granted it was very good.  Can't wait to come back and eat my own prime rib meal.",

We were told we would be seated after they seated a couple other tables, and the style and manner in which this occurred was borderline rude. Next, we were seated in the back, far from the lake view and right next to a table of 6 with a screaming baby. We requested a better table with a view, and while we said we would wait in the bar until they found one, they immediately seated us in a more appropriate place. From that point forward, all was pretty good. We order Oysters, which were fresh and excellent, and $15 for 6. We ordered from the $33 Restaurant Week menu, and ordered 2 glasses of wine each during the meal. Clam Chowder, Chopped Salad, Prime Rib was all above average. My Prime Rib was cold; they immediately took it back and 5 minutes later it was perfect. 20 years ago, this place was a \"special night\" place to go; there were no Ocean Clubs, Maestros, Dominick's, and countless other local spots that now greatly surpass everything Chart House has to offer. Especially when Chart House is 80% and sometimes 90% of the menu prices of these higher end places. So, 3 stars from mostly a nostalgic perspective. Too many better places to choose from.",

However, when I walked in, I was not greeted until I was walking around the restaurant looking for the hostess. When I finally found Amber, she decided to greet me by saying \"we closed the kitchen early, it will be down in 10 minutes\". My best friend her, her husband and I were very upset but still offered to leave. She said no so, we still sat down. We sat down and waited about 10 minutes before any server came up to us. My guests and I were still excited about this experience. We had Joshua as our server. He was VERY rude. He had asked in a very rude tone what we wanted to drink. My best friends husband is diabetic, so all he can drink is unsweetened ice tea so that's what he ordered. Joshua came back very rude and responded with \"we already dumped out ice tea and it takes about an hour to brew\". It really takes an hour to brew ICE TEA really? When we said that enough was enough and that we were ready to go we got the rudest look and when we had asked for his name he had the BIGGEST ATTITUDE. Trust me, I work at a restaurant. I know how things are but we would NEVER close the kitchen early when customers are hungry and ready to spend money. I will NEVER step foot in there again with that attitude. Sad that the owners let their employees have that attitude, we were ready to spend money. Too bad that they wanted to \"close early\" and not take our money. I hope that they rethink the whole thing.",

We recently went for a birthday and again, the food was incredible and the service was stellar! Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable and very friendly. His recommendation for a main meal was perfect - the sea bass was flavorful and had a nice spicy bite to it (which our waiter mentioned so we would know what to expect). I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants great food, attentive service, and a beautiful view and we will continue to come here again and again!",

    "text": "This used to be my all time favorite restaurant; I would want every birthday celebration and special occasion to be here, but sadly not anymore. The location of the Chart House is beautiful and elegant, it has the bones to be a 5 star luxurious dining experience. Unfortunately this place is far from what it once was. It used to have some of the best service, steaks, seafood, salad bar, and mud pie around...now the only thing it can boast is the view.   So let's start with the view since it is gorgeous and on the water, it makes for a romantic setting. Sadly the furniture and decor are dated, torn, and neglected which makes a fancy and expensive dining experience not quite as enjoyable or comfortable. The service used to be top notch, but it seems as though the staff knows the restaurant is going downhill and they are cranky and don't care about their jobs anymore.   The food used to be divine, but it is far from it now. The plates no longer look appetizing, and the salad bar is a a mere shadow of what it was in its former glory. The salad bar is what I used to look forward to the most, but you might has well just go to super salad.  I am so sad that the Chart House has let itself go. This was once a wonderful place that is now not worth the money or the time since there are so many other great places around to enjoy a good meal. If you just want some wine and dessert with a pretty view then by all means enjoy, but if you are looking for more go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Have you ever heard the expression \"Presentation is Everything!\", well this is one of the times that doesn't apply.   The presentation of the food is great and the ambiance and scenery is great as well, however the taste of the food is just so-so.   Me and my wife went to The Chart House to take advantage of their Restaurant Week 3-Course Special.   We both started with the Caesar Salad, which was small and had a string Anchovy taste. The parmesan cheese and croutons were good and the salad was crisp but the dressing ruined the salad. For great Caesar Salad go to The Melting Pot or Mad Greens  We shared the Macadamia Nut Encrusted Chicken and the Maple & Ginger Glazed Salmon, both came with Coconut Ginger Rice.  The Chicken was served in a peanut sauce which didn't really add to the Chicken, the Chicken was good but would have been better if the macadamia nuts were crushed rather than larger chopped pieces. The Salmon tasted like plain salmon, apparently the Maple ginger glaze was either forgotten or it just ran off the salmon to the bottom of the dish because that was the only place there was any sauce.  The Coconut Ginger Rice didn't have any noticeable Coconut flavor or Coconut flakes, and the ginger flavor wasn't very pleasing.   We finished with the Vanilla Creme Brulee, which was done perfect and was very good.   If I were to go again i would probably try the Crispy Coconut Shrimp because that's hard to get wrong or just have the Creme Brulee and a drink after the sun goes down.   WARNING: The chairs in the back room by the deck are very uncomfortable. The chair legs extend all the way up into the chair pad, not under it, and jam you in the bottom of your legs.   Last critique about this restaurant, the floor plan is very cramped with pillars in wall way areas and the waiting area/host counter is in the path to get to the restrooms or out of the restaurant and feels like an obstacle course. Really needs a new floor plan.",

I can't believe people will spend that much money for terrible seafood when they can go to the Salt Cellar for the same price or even Ocean Club.  We spent $92.00 for two of us, no alcohol, coinciding with the salad bar.  That's an extra $9.00.  My Caesar salad was the best part of the meal.  I had shrimp stuffed with crab and my wife had scallions and shrimp.  The shrimp reminded me of the kind you buy frozen at the supermarket; they were small and rubbery.  I doubt they were even fresh.  I'd rate them with the same quality as the Red Lobster or even worse.  The crab stuffing was okay but it didn't match up with the Salt Cellar.  I can't comment on the Scallions because I never eat them but my wife left one over.  I thought she was getting sick. The service was fine but nothing special.  Stay away, make a reservation a week early for the Ocean Club or Cellar; you wont be disappointed.",

Instead of the kitschy, music pounding, over the top environment, you are welcomed into a classy restaurant where the goal is allow you to relax and enjoy the dinner experience rather than being overwhelmed by it. The hostess immediately welcomed us and immediately sat us with a view of both the outside fireplace and the lake. Our server Kelly immediately made us feel welcome and ensured that our drink order were placed and that she was available to answer any questions. Her super customer service continued throughout the evening.   We started with the Chart House chopped salad and the special tempura shrimp rolls. The salad was extremely fresh and crisp with wonderful made-in-house dressings. The tempura shrimp rolls tasted good but had a rather thick tempura crust and had to much rice compared to the amount of shrimp. Two of the party had crab cakes for dinner which filled with lump crab and were very tasty. The other member of the party had the prime rib which was a generous portion, perfectly cooked and great taste especially with some fresh horseradish. Unfortunately we didn't have room for desert since we would have liked to have tried their signature lava cake.   Bottom line a great experience both in terms of customer service and food but they could have done a bit better on the food (e.g. lighter and more shrimp for the shrimp roles, etc). However all around very much worthy of another visit.",

Summary of menu items tried: Coconut Shrimp: prepared from frozen and shrimp was not deveined (gross)!  Salad bar: Fresh, but far from interesting for the price.  Filet: totally unseasoned, tasted like boiled! Tough and chewy. Could not finish. Teriyaki Fillet Medallions: Sauce from a bottle from \"Safeway\". Very bad and chewy/tough.  Sea Bass: Wasn't sea bass. Was prepared from frozen, overcooked and totally unseasoned. Orzo reheated from yesterday with a \"skin\" on top!  Service: knew that 18% tip mandatory. Was TERRIBLE, inattentive and SLOW.  Only reason I paid the \"mandatory tip\" is because I didn't want to make a scene with all of my guests.    I am NOT HAPPY with the ripoff that the Chart House gave us tonight.  That waiter made over $80 in \"mandatory tips\"  from my bill.  I am blessed to have been successful in business, and I am normally pleased to pay my bills - but I worked very hard for my money and I hate being ripped off.  And the Chart House ripped me off.  Called Management later to complain about the low quality food and service. Will see what happens to be fair and will update this.  Manager on the phone said that he would \"inform corporate\" about our complaint.  Should note that two guests (the ones that had the Caesar salads) ended up getting very ill later that night.  The likely culprit is food poisoning from the Caesar Salads.  All in agreement (several of us are Physicians and Nurses).",

    "text": "We had 6 adults   and 2 children in our party to celebrate an anniversary, we arrived at 5.30 on a Monday Night, we were seated in 10 minutes at a table across the restaurant away from other diners.   I thought something might be a little wrong when I had to make two trips  from the bar to bring our own drinks to the table.    We were seated and were given menus.  That is when the real waiting started.  We asked if there were any specials and we were told it is on the menu, my father informed the waiter that he is legally blind and asked for assistance, so the waiter proceeded to read the fish specials over the shoulder of his wife.   While the group was deciding, my father ordered a bottle of champagne to be delivered for this special occasion.   Glasses were brought to the table but I think they had to go to France to get the selection.    The table presentation was very nice but we were given an additional black napkin to everyone but the patriarch.    Finally the last napkin was delivered and the champagne was poured.   Our orders were taken and then the real waiting began.   At 6.45pm (remember we were seated at 5.30) we inquired where our appetizers were and asked for another drink order.   We were told they were coming.   The shrimp and oysters were delivered but the three bowls of lobster bisque soup did not arrive.   When they finally arrived they were  luke warm.   They were sent back and when they were returned, you could tell that they had been microwaved in the same bowl.   Needless to say, there were returned again.      We again waited for the entrees and had to call the waiter over to service the table, to remove the dirty glasses and again refresh the drink orders.    Finally at 7.20pm our entrees arrived.   The presentation was very good but some of the orders were missing items.   (the filet did not arrive with the additional crab that was ordered and when it was delivered  it was in a  ramekin.   The mashed potatoes were cold.   We were not going to send them back to the microwave.  When we finished the waiter came to ask if we wanted dessert but we were never offered coffee.   We asked for the bill.   The bill was delivered but the dirty dinner dishes were never removed.     Suffice it to say the whole evening was a disaster.   My father wanted this dinner to be a special for my husbands and my 29th wedding anniversary.   We left after my husband his \"third chat with the Manager\" leaving a 1.00 tip on a 450.00 tab.   My husband told the manager he owed the tip to the waiter for not providing the proper support  to get the job done.   We also mentioned that  they should clean up the goose poop from the front enterance before the dinner service is started.    We realize that part of the resturant's charm is the water setting with the wildlife but to walk trough it entering and leaving is not very desirable.       This was not our first experience with this property but will be our last until management is skilled on proper service for a 5 star restaurant.",

The prime rib was tepid, and the potatoes were warm.  Not hot.  So the diners who didn't have food simply entertained the ones who were eating.  That's the one star.  The waiter apologized, the manager apologized.  She didn't offer to comp ANYTHING, she didn't offer dessert or a glass of wine.

My friend had a bug in her water and asked the waiter for a new glass...he took it from her without an appology and when he brought her a new glass, said \"here ya go\".   Maybe it was an off night for the staff, but we will never go back to find out.",

You'd think that we would get quick service as they were not busy - no way..... the waiter was pleasant, the salad bar pretty good, the view was nice, the food - just ok.  The food coming out of the kitchen was s l o w. Really not worth going back to when there are so many other worthy restaurants.",

Where was the manager..arguing with other patrons!!!  Why didn't he help out if they were short staffed? Maybe he needs to take a lesson in being on the team!  Don't know if we will ever come back.

The place looked moderately busy, but not packed.  Not sure why it still took the hostess so long to seat us.  We got seated, and yes, the view is beautiful, but the service was very very slow.  We tried to order the oysters as appetizers, but they were out, so we went with the Ahi Tuna Tacos.  It took our server 15 mins to come back to tell us that they are out of those as well?  Why would it take them that long when the restaurant was not that busy to begin with?  Needless to say, we are disappointed in that.  Then comes the prime ribs.  I'd say the prime rib is just average because it looks and taste like the prime ribs you get at a buffet. Then our server just disappeared.  It was the longest dinner service which I don't understand how that is even possible when it's slow and on a Monday night.  I've been to the one out on Redondo Beach, CA. and LOVE the service and food there.  I just don't think the one here in Arizona is as good as the one in California.  I would say I would not come back here to dine because it's really just the \"view\" and since I love food, I expect better food for the prices on the menu.",

I must admit, I was a bit hesitant to come here since the overall rating on Yelp is three stars, but I was at a convention that was close, and my friends accommodated me in having it at this location.  Since there were five of us, we ordered quite a bit on the happy hour menu to try it out.  We had the firecracker shrimp, fried artichoke hearts, lettuce wraps, kimchi calamari, prime rib sliders, shrimp tacos.   And to top it off, we all shared in a lick-the-plate chocolate pie.  I tried everything except the sliders and the tacos.   My favorite was the shrimp.   Quite tasty.  We each had two drinks, mine being the titos martini.  Jesus was our server, and was quite friendly and professional.  Luke, the manager, came by a couple of times to make sure everyone was enjoying herself.  I would return.   The view is appealing since the room is surrounded by windows.",

They only have one bottle at a time and they didn't have anything for the steak. So my husband ate his steak dry.  The bottle of red wine was hot and had to be put in ice to cool it to \"cellar temperature \". Why would anyone want to drink red wine at 74 degrees??",

    "text": "There were literally too many mishaps to go into detail about each one so I'll try to make this as concise as possible: -We made a reservation. When we arrive we ask for a seat near a window for the lake view (it's nearing sunset) and are told there none available. I count 3 on our walk to our table. We're seated just slightly back but still have an ok view of the lake. -The waiter seems nervous. I assume he's new, no big deal. Shortly after serving us our drinks he knocks over a full glass of ice water on the table and into my husbands lap. Still no big deal, who hasn't spilled water? -We ask a bus boy (who didn't see it happen) to replace the wet linens so my husband doesn't have wet arms and legs. The bus boy grabs a dry corner of the table cloth, and questions \"this is wet?\" we explain the situation and he reluctantly agrees to change it out.  -We're standing around awkwardly while they switch them out and move to the bar so we're not in the way of the waitstaff.  -While at the bar we see our table is ready and begin to walk over seconds before we get there the hostess seats another group at our table and we immediately explain the situation to her away from the group that has just been seated. She doesn't know what to do so we let our server know and walk back to the bar. We've already ordered at this point otherwise we'd have just left.  -Amber, the manager, comes out and rather than starting with an apology says in an accusatory way \"what seems to be the problem?\" Even though she must already know. She does apologize at the end of our explanation and offers us a table even further back from the lake view.  -Once seated we're offered bread. And then have to ask 3 times to actually get it.  -My husband and I ordered our steaks medium rare plus. His was much more rare than mine and Amber asked if it was ok I told her I ordered it medium (because I usually do but had ordered it slightly more rare than usual based off our waiter's description of how they do medium). She says it is medium and walks off, without giving me time to explain my brief memory lapse.  -my husband's steak was supposed to come with grilled onions, it didn't again no apology from Amber just \"I can bring grilled onions\" and she did.  -Our desserts were supposed to be comp'd so we ordered 2 total, for each couple to share. My husband orders the lava cake that takes up to 30 minutes to make and 5 minutes after ordering it Amber comes by our table to let us know she took someone else's  lava cake order and made sure it would come to us instead for all the trouble. She says it will be here in 10-12 minutes. Nice gesture, but 35 minutes after ordering it we get his lava cake.  -Our friends insisted in paying the bill which we would have preferred to pay since we made the reservation and felt awful about the experience. As far as I heard they took 20 off the bill which is irrelevant. The issue wasn't the bill. It was honestly the absolute worst customer service and dining experience EVER!   -I ALMOST FORGOT THERE WAS A WEDDING GOING ON ACROSS THE LAKE AND A FIREWORKS DISPLAY FROM A BOAT WHICH WE COULDN'T SEE  BECAUSE THEY MOVED OUR TABLE.  It's a mid range restaurant as far as price goes so I wasn't expecting high end service, but this was absolutely ridiculous. Amber is not good at her job. Literally just start with an apology. We were super reasonable, at not one point were we rude or combative. At our absolute worst we were direct. We were INCREDIBLY patient through all the mess ups, and this should have been handled better.",

You assume when you're paying $45 for a steak you might be able to let them know what cut of prime rib you would like. My dad ordered an end cut prime rib which the waiter rolled his eyes  at his request.   Worst waiter I e ever had at a nice restaurant.  He had curly hair blindfish brown hair make sure you don't get him.  It was an experience you would have expected at Denny's not with a $300 dinner.  The Prime Rib came out half fat and when we told the manager he said prime rib is fatty.   The waiter rolled his eyes so many times I stopped counting. He is what you call an order taker. We also asked for creamy horseradish and he said they didn't have it but of course it came on the dish. The waiter was a complete jackass and completely ruined our experience. I feel bad because my dad paid and this was a big deal to take us all out and this was our experience.    If you want to spend $40 on a steak going anywhere else and you'll have a better meal and experience.",

    "text": "The whole experience is between a 3 and 4 stars, but I give this restaurant 4 because, overall, you get out satisfied.  The unbeatable element of this restaurant is the location: the Camelback lake offers a relaxing and romantic view with a cozy atmosphere that will make you enjoy your meal even more.  My father and I decided to dine here on a Wednesday night, the day before Thanksgiving. I was glad to observe the restaurant was quite full, yet, we were seated at our favorite table right at the window on the lake shore.  I recommend getting here at the sunset to take nice pictures, although even at night the view is still beautiful.  Both my father and I had seafood: his Alaskan crab legs were delicious, a bit small, but good. I got the saute sea bass which was very delicate in taste. Ask for the salad bar before your entrees, it's only $9.50/person and you can go back and forth as many times as you want!  And now the less positive aspect: the service. For being an upscale restaurant with entrees that ranges from $40 to $60, service was a bit slow and careless. I'm not referring to our waitress only but also to buss boys and staff in general.  Our waitress (I don't want to mention the name) was maybe too busy to bother to come to our table to check if everything was okay. Small things like missing silverware or asking if everything was okay.  When taking our orders, she mentioned that their chocolate lava cake takes approximately 25-30 minutes to cook, so she asked if we wanted one right at the beginning and we said yes. However, after we were done with our meals we still waited half an hour for the lava cake to come out. So I don't get the point of asking beforehand if you still have to wait that long!  No specials either. In the end, I still tipped more than 20% just because I don't believe in the \"punishment of the tip\". But I hope the staff will read this review and recognize to pay more attention next time. Food was amazing, service so so.  Will I return ? Of course, but next time, if something goes wrong, I may have a word or two with the manager.",

The only negative was the happy hour menu is only available at the bar, and there is limited bar seating, which is first come first serve--understandable. They have a bountiful salad bar with many organic options. The marinated mushrooms and the build your own Caesar salad were my favorite. I saw many positive reviews about the coconut shrimp appetizer so of course we had to get that. I had the coconut shrimp app, the sword fish entree, and the salad bar. Didn't even need to think about dessert because the watermelon and pineapple on the salad bar was perfection, but our waiter was extra attentive and heard me say it was my mother's birthday and brought what tasted like tiramisu ice cream with a candle. The coconut shrimp app came with three different dipping sauces and a unique presentation in an edible rice bowl. The swordfish was perfectly grilled--juicy! The organic vegetables with the entree- perfectly seasoned. Also, the rice had a really unique flavor--and I don't usually eat rice! A great time was had by all.",

The special was Blackened Salmon with three prawns, rice and mixed vegetables. That's what I ordered and when it came out, I saw the butter sauce flow to the other side of the plate as it was being placed in front of me. There was so much butter that it got into my rice and mixed vegetables. Now the prawns that topped the salmon was presented three different ways, one was sliced in half, the other one had the tail and the last one was missing a tail. I was not pleased with my meal and I let the manager know who offered to replace the rice and mixed vegetables. I declined since I was already halfway done with my meal. My wife had the 10 oz prime rib which was tasty but  the meat had about two oz of fat which she removed before eating. The salad bar is the star of the meal with fresh vegetables and a station to have your Cesar Salad prepared. For dessert we had the three flavors of ice cream which were refreshing with a cup of coffee. We been here before and the meal was excellent which is the reason I decided to celebrate our anniversary here.",

    "text": "My heart sank when I walked in and saw the gorgeous view because, with a few rare exceptions, restaurants with great views often have \"meh\" food because they can count on ambiance for business.   It sank further when I saw the Ponderosa-style salad bar.  Call me a foodie snob but a salad bar is a bad sign much like book-thick menus with pictures.    We sat at the bar with the intent of having a drink before our reservation but the bartender never got to us.    Once seated, my husband ordered a brown derby.  He received a drink that was tasty but it was not, in any way, a brown derby.    My spicy cucumber drink was bland, boring and lacked complexity.  I ordered the tuna and while the tuna was actually decent quality, the preparation was a snooze (shallot butter should have had more flavor).  My mixed vegetables were unevenly cooked - some were mushy, others were raw.    Skip it.  Go to McCormick-Stillman Park for the view and pay Old Town prices at a restaurant with good food.",

At the time, I was pretty young and had to pretend I was \"older\" to get into the restaurant. I dressed up like an older teen would and ordered shrimp off the starter menu (no kid's meal here). What I remember most were the views. We were seated right next to the window, and even at night, could see the reflection off the water. Everything was decorated nicely in the restaurant and service was friendly. Looking at the menu, it doesn't look like much has changed over the years.",

You seat everyone and serve everyone until close. I know this is corporate and that is a NO NO to close early. Maybe post that on your internet page that hours may very during summer. Seriously? Then waiting 5 minutes we get Joshua as our server. He was very rude approaching our table. I wanted to already walk out when he took our drink order but one of my friends said \"no let's just stay.\" BUT then he comes back to the table and says \"The ice tea is going to take an hour to brew\"  I know that is complete bull****. I work in the same kind of business. I know it doesn't take more than 6 minutes to brew. I work for a corporate restaurant. I will NEVER come here again. Horrible costumer service.

    "text": "We decided to try this restaurant out for Restaurant Week.  It has been on my shortlist to try based on the offered selections.  The restaurant itself is quite beautiful and is on a lake in Scottsdale and made for a beautiful place to watch the sun set.  The dining room was pretty clean, but I did spy quite a few cobwebs in the ceiling lights.  We had to request a Restaurant Week menu as it was not provided when we were seated. (This is a first as the many other places we have visited over the years have always advertised their participation.  It almost made me feel ashamed to ask for it.)  The alcoholic drink selection was ok.  They serve hardly any beer, if you want beer with your dinner go somewhere else.  The mixed drinks were ok with the Moscato Sangria being the top beverage of the night.  We ordered our food.  We were provided a bread basket but there literally wasn't 1 piece of bread per person at the table, and one person was stuck eating crackers.  No additional bread was ever offered (probably because we ordered the Restaurant Week), the apps came out timely.  The beef carpaccio was overall the best app.  The others were mediocre.  When the main course came out we tried everyones' meals.  The macadamia crusted shrimp were good, but very tough.  The prime rib was way overdone for the medium that was ordered, and the herb crusted chicken was literally raw.  The chicken was immediately sent back to the kitchen.  10 minutes later the exact previously raw already cut into chicken breast was placed back on the exact same plate and served as it was.  The server claimed the item had been replated but it very clearly had not been.  No one was blown away by any of the meals.  The desserts came out, they were ok.  The Creme Brulee was definitely the best.  At the end of the meal the Manager came by to check on our meal, we recounted the raw chicken fiasco and he told us \"thank you for your patience\" and \"I will let the cooks know\".  So I am pretty sure they already know since they had to recook the thing!!  Not one item was comped on the bill... not one...  Keeping in mind the price point of this restaurant, the service was poor and the food was way below par.  I have experienced much better meals at Red Lobster for much less money.  We will not be returning.  If I am spending in the $30-$60 a plate range there are far better options available that will keep me returning to that meal in my dreams.",

Water was delivered with something floating it the bottom of glass.  One of our salad dishes stuck to the table cloth when they picked it up , thus the bottom of the dish was dirty.

    "text": "The Chart House has been a restaurant that has been around for ages (nationally), and unfortunately, it's starting to show.  This seems to be a place that has \"grown\" with its clientele -- those people who come here are the same families that have been coming for years, but are now bringing their children and grandchildren.  There is nothing wrong with that (my family has its faves), but I might just be too late attempt to add another.  As such, the Chart House, while perfectly picturesque and with decent service, just isn't a culinary star in Scottsdale.  More specifically, my wife and I ordered the coconut shrimp and the blue-cheese/panko crusted asparagus for appetizers.  Admittedly, the coconut shrimp was a \"throw-away\" dish -- it's our go-to at Outback, and we had a craving.  The asparagus was a bit different, but enjoyable -- it wasn't pretty, but it certainly had us talking about it as the high-point afterwards.  The macadamia crusted mahi was simply so-so.  While not bad, the fish wasn't flaky and the sauce (peanut something-or-other) was so heavy it masked the mahi flavor.  My wife's ceasar salad had 3 croutons in total on it -- not a deal breaker, but it seemed pre-prepared.  But the one thing that customers need to know, the prepared cocktails (at ~$10 a pop) and really light on the pours and even lighter on the flavor (e.g. pineapple caipirhana) -- we couldn't justify getting a second drink with the entree.  We had high hopes for this place (we had been to the one in San Diego years ago), and unfortunately, it would not be a place we would actively choose to go again.  That being said, we wouldn't say \"no\" if someone really wanted to go.  In our estimation, it was simply an overpriced so-so restaurant.  If it weren't for the lovely view, I think our night would have underwhelmed completely.",

The only way I was able to eat here was because a family friend treated my family out. But if you're looking to spoil yourself or anyone you know, with food, this is the place to do it.   I ordered the Chicken Romano (pan-seared with a blend of romano cheese & panko breadcrumbs, with lemon shallot butter, tomatoes, asparagus & yukon gold mashed potatoes). The chicken pan-seared with bread crumbs was great to eat, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.The asparagus... I've had better, but the yukon gold mashed potatoes were silky, buttery and made perfectly. They went well with the chicken romano.  My dad ordered the NY Strip, and they were kind of enough to cut it up for him since he was handicapped. They checked up on us frequently. THE ONLY THING I WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT WAS THEY ACTUALLY CAME UP AND ASKED IF I WAS DONE (ALREADY GRABBING AT MY PLATE) WHEN THE FORK WAS STILL IN MY MOUTH BECAUSE APPARENTLY I WAS STILL EATING. Since that ruined my entire experience thus far, I just told them to take it.  In addition, the entire table got an order of the unlimited salad bar. The salad bar was great, but nothing like the choices offered at Souplantation. Also, because I ate the salad beforehand, I wasn't able to finish off the main entree I ordered.   Will I be back? Probably not.",

We usually stick to Ruth Chris for special and intimate dinner dates, however, we decided to try the Chart House. First, let me say something nice, beautiful scenery! Now let me be honest, the food was horrible!!! For the price (which would not have been bad if the quality was there) we expected at least Ruth Chris middle range quality, however, we were disappointed with the luke warm clam chowder, soggy overcooked asparagus, wilted vegetable salad bar, bland fish entree, and bland and small shrimp with scallops entree. I guess the initial red flag should have been soon after we arrived, and received our initial cocktails, about 15 minutes later, we asked the waitress if it is common to offer a bread basket, her response, \"um, sometimes we do, it just depends if someone wants bread, would you like some bread?\" By then we had been sitting for more than 20 minutes and were hungry and ready to order our food, plus, who goes to a restaurant and \"has\" to ask for bread, they usually force it on you! Next, when our entrees were delivered we asked for tabasco because the food was so bland, she actually brought us a teeny tiny bottle of tabasco, you know, the size that they give you at a hotel when you order room service! Finally, she asked me if I wanted fresh pepper with my clam chowder, it was extremely bland, so I said yes, well, she disappeared and did not return until I was halfway through the bowl! The waitress knew that the service was horrible, so before she brought the bill, she sent out a complimentary dessert. Not all was bad, the next day we went to Twin Peaks Bar Grill, and we had the best experience, customer service was awesome, drinks were good, and the bar food was better than our Chart House meal!!",

Dinner was delicious (gazpacho, miso salmon, and tuna tartare), as well as the strawberry basil cocktail, the martini, and the tripple berry cobbler.  The waiter was attentive and helpful, although the hostess took FOREVER to get us seated even though there was no one else waiting.   great for a romantic evening, if you sit out on the patio.",

    "text": "We have been to many great Chart Houses across the US, and but definitely not this one.  We took a friend to celebrate her retirement.  Started off well--great interior and setting on a lake and after drinks we got seated at a lovely table in the corner with a great lake view.  Nice Congratulations card from them to our friend on her retirement and our menu's all said Happy Retirement on the top.  But all downhill from there, as service was very slow, dinner finally served and our guest's chicken was raw inside.  20 min to redo that while the rest of us finished our complete meal.  Manager comes over to ask how things were and sort of says well yes I know there was a problem and I do apologize, but how was everything else?!?   Then the coffee arrives cold and they were out of creme brulee.  They did comp both the chicken and the desert but it made for very disappointing evening and the celebration was a bust.",

We were not disappointed. Hummus trio appetizer, coconut shrimp entree with three dipping sauces, and chopped spinach salad... And of course, wine. It was all delicious and served very capably by our nice server, Ana. If you want a nice meal in a relaxing water view setting, complete with white tablecloths, Chart House is a great choice. We highly recommend this restaurant.",

The prime rib is very flavorful and exceptionally tender,.and you get a very healthy portion.  And seafood...yes seafood.

    "text": "The last time I'd been to the Chart House was when I was 8 years old, but at the original location in Aspen, Colorado. It's everything I remember it to be.   It's a restaurant you plan on going to--a \"special occasion\" worthy place. This location is no exception.  Expect upscale dining in a gorgeous setting. Be sure to make a reservation and ask to be seated by the windows.    The waitstaff go out of their way to ensure that you are having an enjoyable meal.  The maitre'd even comes by as you near dessert to introduce himself.    The fare is mostly fish and beef. I enjoyed the seafood grill: Asian glazed salmon, shrimp scampi, and a jumbo-lump crab cake with Yukon gold mashed potatoes and asparagus. I devoured every last bit of fish on my plate.   One highlight of dining here is the salad bar. Yes, the salad bar. But it's different--it's the Chart House salad bar!!!  Order an entree and for $8.50 you can enjoy unlimited caviar, fresh fruit, cold salads (i.e. pasta salad, potato salad, artichoke heart salad...) and traditional salad bar items. Or, for $16 you can make this your entree. Savor this. Go back for seconds. And thirds. Maybe even fourths.   I wasn't expecting our entrees to come out so fast. 14 minutes to be exact, the waiter informed us...a little too fast for such a high-end restaurant. I prefer to savor my salad bar items. Linger a bit before the big show, if you know what I mean.   Toward the end of the meal an inebriated party of four was seated next to us. What a scene. When you're paying top dollar and expecting a pleasant dining experience, the last thing you want is drunkards offering to buy your table shots. Completely uncalled for. I know it's not the restaurant's fault, but they shouldn't have seated them in the first place. It's not a sports bar--it's the Chart House!",

It's beautiful on the lake. The atmosphere is good as well. We have had good experiences with the wait staff, and our food has been good. However, we recently had friends we hadn't seen for many years visiting. We purposely made an early reservation so we could linger and enjoy their company. We didn't ask for a table with a lake view, but were delighted to get one.  We had drinks, salad, dinner, etc., totaling over $300. Our waiter came over, and apologetically said there were people wanting our table by the window!  We have asked many times on other visits for one of those prime tables, and have been told they were full or reserved, so we sat elsewhere. We got up to leave, and walked by at least eight empty tables. My husband stopped to talk to the manager, and made it clear we didn't appreciate being kicked out with our dear friends. I have NEVER been asked to leave an establishment - ever. This is unacceptable. The manager basically shrugged and said \"sorry.\" That was it. We chose this restaurant because we wanted a fine dining experience, and didn't want to be rushed through a meal. Diners have CHOICES. There are so many good restaurants in Scottsdale. Choose Maestros, Dominick's, Eddie V's, Ocean Prime, Ruth's Chris, or one of countless others if you want to be treated with respect.",

It was an off-the-menu brunch instead, so we ordered accordingly.  My father-in-law found a live ladybug in his salad from the salad bar, I had a shell in my lobster bisque and twice had to return my crab cake due to it being uncooked in the center (isn't this a seafood restaurant?).  While we waited for coffee to be brewed and our dessert to be delivered, we expected to have our table cleared in preparation.  This was not the case.  There were still dished on our table when they finally had fresh coffee for us.    Our server really tried her best to remain calm and courteous in the face of these problems.  I'm disappointed we had very little interaction with the manager since we had a table that seemed plagued with problems.    This restaurant is supposed to be professional and highly regarded.  I fail to see the professionalism that one would associate with such an establishment.",

Limited toppings like you get in diners..  At the end of the salad bar, you can heap your plate with stewed veggies of unknown origin (ugh), potato  salad, canned fruit salad, and some kind of rice concoction.  Really gone down hill in the last four years.  Not worth $18.00; One of our group ordered a chicken entree for $22.  It was a small leg and a thigh. Wonder who gets the better parts of the chicken.  Veggies with entree are all extra. Dessert is a store made coffee ice cream wedge Fake butter with the bread.  Great service.  If you want to be ripped off as you look over the small lake , this is for you.  But trust me folks, there are a lot better eateries in the area.",

The atmosphere is nice, the restaurant is quiet, and the ambience was appealing. Our experience this time was less than wonderful. The staff was great and service was very good but honestly the food quality was so-so given the expense. That is to say it was much what you would expect from a restaurant chain where food is drenched with butter and salt to give it flavor and you go home feeling bloated and disgusting from the meal. The appetizer (we had something with crab and shrimp, avocado and mango) was rather bland, really, given the appealing combination of ingredients. I would recommend something like fresh lemon or something to give it a tad more flavor, but it was at least fresh. My wife had a dish with scallops, shrimp and gnocchi and while it was flavorful, it was too rich and the flavor wasn't the sort of nuanced combination of delicious ingredients one would normally expect from a higher-end restaurant. The same was True for the herb-encrusted snapper I chose. The bed of sauce it lay in tasted like cream and butter and the side of spinach we had was the same way. I'm sure all told we had in excess of 10,000 calories between us and frankly, the food probably didn't taste all that different from something you'd get at Red Lobster, which we avoid like the plague. One with a refined palate would not count this choice among one's short list of places to go for food quality and next time we'll look elsewhere as for us the experience needs to be both culinary AND atmospheric if we're going to spend $175 for a meal, which is what our bill came to. It's hard enough to spend $45 for a typical $14 bottle of merlot without the food being at best, well, average chain restaurant fare.",

My boyfriend and I went in on Christmas Day to eat in the bar area, but after realizing they offered an extremely limited menu, we asked for a table instead. We were told reservations only - understandable on Christmas. Out of curiosity, I checked <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpenTable.com&s=c91bdbc3a0ec574526e58696cba3aeccf3c9f0bf51b27a302b229c80b40f42ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a> and saw that they had a reservation available for 2 in 15 minutes so I booked it. We closed out at the bar, and approached the snarky hostess with our confirmation in hand to be seated. She said that we weren't in her system and refused to seat us so we asked to speak with her manager. The manager, Lori Schleicher (could be misspelling - staff would not spell it for me) came to speak with us and immediately had a horrible attitude, treated us with disdain, and said that we had \"gotten a table in a roundabout way\" so we would not be served that evening. (WHAT?! Booking a table online is wrong??) She was incredibly curt and unapologetic, so we asked to speak with her manager. The gentleman who introduced himself as the Managing Director, Johnny Barnett, was not much better. He said that he understood there was a problem since we'd gotten a reservation while we were in the building and therefore would not honor our reservation. I stated that there was no provision on the website for a person's location or any requirements for the timing of when a reservation was made. We'd been allowed to reserve a table and should not be penalized for that if it wasn't supposed to be able to happen. He said that clearly someone had cancelled their reservation, which is why we were allowed to book, and when I pointed out that this indicates they have the capacity to serve us, he said that they overbook their reservations and count on people to cancel to get by. Unacceptable. NOT ONCE did they apologize or treat us with respect. We're repeat customers and have sent several friends and family their way. NEVER AGAIN. TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, THEY MARKED US AS NO SHOWS ON OPENTABLE AFTER REPEATEDLY INSISTING THAT OUR RESERVATION WAS NOT IN THEIR SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. This prompted for me to get an email from OpenTable chastising me for not showing up when they were the ones that would not allow us to be seated. Ugh! Given the level that this establishment pretends to operate at, which is evident in their pricing, I would expect much, much better treatment and service. SAVE YOUR EVENING AND GO SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE!",

    "text": "This restaurant is unbelievably over-priced for the quality of the food. In fact, we assumed that it was the 1st week of the semester for the culinary school at Scottsdale Community College and that new students were being tested on their cooking skills in the kitchen to assess what they'd need to learn in the coming year. We concluded they'd need to learn a lot if that was indeed the case! The setting overlooking a lake is nice if you are seated such that you can see out. The place has a men's clubby gestalt to it. It was so moody (e.g., dark) that every single patron we saw with a menu had their smartphones out with the flashlights turned on to read the small font, lightly printed offerings.  The only tasty dish we tried was the chopped spinach salad. The baked, stuffed shrimp was over-cooked and slightly charred. The grilled tilapia was much too over-salted. And what they were calling a shrimp \"scampi\" (a very specific set of ingredients and flavors qualifies as a scampi) absolutely was not; rather, it was a gluey, tasteless interpretation of an Alfredo sauce on a large pile of linguine with a not excessive number of small-medium-ish sized shrimps. Because the scampi was misrepresented, the one of us who ordered the stuffed shrimp was long finished with their meal before the replacement for the 'scampi' dish, a tilapia came out. That meal then had to be eaten alone also.  We were charged the full, exorbitant prices for the dishes we ate. No comp for the inconvenience of having to eat separately after looking forward to a special dinner. No comp of a dessert. No apology. In fact, the waitress and whoever came out to respond to the situation (he didn't identify himself...) both acted as though it was our fault that their food was ill-prepared and inaccurately named.  Chart House needs to hire decent chefs at this place if they're going to charge the prices they're charging. All I could keep thinking while trying to eat these dishes was, \"What would Gordon Ramsay say?\" Believe me, it wouldn't be printable here....",

The $19 salad bar had brown and wilted lettuce, yellow broccoli, and 4 dressing choices.  The ambiance was very casual for a $40 per entree meal which did not include sides. I will be spending my money elsewhere.",

The much toured kava chocolate dessert equally as disappointing - it wasn't even warm and it was store bought quality.  The service even worse - the girl did not even inquire as to whether we liked the dishes. The atmosphere is perhaps the only saving grace.",

    "text": "We went to the Chart House just last night for a work party/dinner. And I was blown away! After reading the reviews here on Yelp, my husband and I were a bit worried about coming. But we were so pleasantly surprised. When we arrived, for our work event, a mini version of the original menu had been selected for us to choose from. I was a bit panicky because I have Celiacs and have to be gluten free, and not many of the options on the pre-selected menu was gluten free. And none of the appetizers they had brought out for our cocktail hour were gluten free either. One of the servers, Ronni, made it his personal responsibility to find me things I could eat! So he brought out a special plate just for me during cocktail hour, and continuously brought me Shirley Temples before they would even run out. They would joke and call me their special guest and favorite attendee.  And Ronni told me I could order anything I wanted off of the gluten free menu! Which made me feel SO much better and gave me a much more varied selection. I even would have been happy with the salad they had pre-selected so long as there were no croutons. But they brought me a whole different salad with strawberries and mandarins! It was delicious! I ordered the lobster tail, and had a baked potatoe. And crem brule for the dessert. And everything was perfect and delicious!  The rest of the staff was absolutely wonderful as well, everyone was genuinely kind and hospitable.  I'd like to thank Ronni especially SO much for being so personal and taking great care of me. I've never been to a restaurant that seemed to so deeply care about making sure I was able to enjoy a meal with everyone else. I'm so used to places casting my needs aside because they are not able, or care to make an effort, to meet my need. Not only did I feel taken care of, it helped me enjoy the night stress free. THANK YOU!",

The setting was perfect for the occasion with the restaurant overlooking the water, and the ambiance overall classic and upscale. Our server was fantastic and did not rush us through dinner at all which we greatly appreciated due to the nature of our reason for dining there.   As far as food goes, I had some of THE best prime rib I have ever tasted. Meat was cooked to perfection (I prefer medium), and flavor was outstanding. We had the coconut shrimp as well as the hummus appetizers. Both delicious!   I could not give this restaurant 5stars due to my salad, and the dessert. I should have done the salad bar which looked amazing. My dad loaded his plate up, and said all items were fresh and tasted great. My chopped salad had good flavors but seemed a little wilted. I didn't finish it.. Additionally, the lava cake for dessert was a little dry.   Overall a great experience, and I will go back!   Thank you for helping us celebrate our special news!",

    "text": "WHAT A FANTASTIC THANKSGIVING DINNER I HAD HERE AT CHART HOUSE TONIGHT! Yes, folks, my family and I don't cook for Turkey day. We don't like the mess or the cooking part. Lol. Anyways, my dad made reservations here a few weeks ago online. We were seated within a few minutes upon arrival and greeted quickly by our server. The ambiance was great. Super intimate with low lighting (probably not best for those with poor vision LOL) and beautiful views! The buildings across the lake were decorated with beautiful Christmas lights and if it were day time, I'm sure the lake view would have been amazing.  So, we started off with a bottle of white wine that my dad picked. Forgot which kind. We ordered the kimchee calamari, and oh my lanta, what a great choice that was! It was a little salty, however, so if you're watching your salt intake, beware. For thanksgiving, they offered a turkey dinner, so of course I ordered this as did the rest of my family. It came with turkey, choice of mashed potatoes or sweet potato, creamed spinach, cranberry jelly, and cornbread stuffing with your choice of pumpkin or pecan pie for dessert. Yes, it was exquisite. Perhaps my favorite part was the creamed spinach. When we ran out of wine, I ordered the fiery cucumber cocktail (cucumber martini basically with cayenne pepper rim... Caliente!). My boyfriend ordered the berry Moscow mule... The berries complimented the ginger beer SO well!  I guess I was overall very pleased with the atmosphere, food and the service. It is strange that this place got mediocre reviews overall... Perhaps it is necessary to look at demographics to see whether or not reviews will actually be accurate. ;)  Although we came here for Thanksgiving, I would definitely come back again another night. I would want to sit on the patio for sure during the day and enjoy Arizona's wonderful winter season. I recommend this place for sure.",

But we should have been advised of this beforehand as the whole idea is to meet up and visit with the entire group.  I ordered coconut shrimp at a price of $29.00.  It came with three sauces which were nice and the  sticky mango rice was tasty.  There were 5 or 6 shrimp that were also good, but not over the top or lots of food.  One person in our group had a well done filet which the server suggested she have fileted because of the doneness.  She took that suggestion however one side of the steak was burnt.  We asked for water, that never arrived.  We requested steak sauce and it was brought in the bottle, not in a sauce dish.  As this was toted to be upscale there were disappointments.  Another person ordered a filet medium and it was definitely medium rare.  It was sent back and cooked some more and it still wasn't right and there was not any mention of a reduction in the bill for this error.  I would not go back.  This is acceptable for Denny's, not upscale.",

Lots of ducks swimming and really pretty ambiance.  Our waitress, Lindsay, was wonderful!  Recommended items, shared her favorites and was able to clearly articulate why she loved them. Very personable and engaged with our table to the point she shared pics of her kiddos with us after we inquired before we left.  She was awesome!  We started with clam chowder and lobster bisque.  It was all hearty with meat and delicious.  We then shared coconut shrimp and crab stuffed shrimp.  The coconut shrimp is a favorite.  The Thai chili sauce with it is a fabulous combo of sweet and sour and spicy.  Delicious!  The crab stuffed shrimp is tasty and more savory without being too heavy.  It was also wonderful.  We ended with mud pie and key lime pie and s round of decaf coffees. The mud pie is enormous and more than enough for a table of 4.  We way over ordered.  Everything was wonderful!  Based on prior reviews this is a hit or miss spot.  We hit a solid five star experience and would recommend asking for Lindsey if you want fabulous and attentive Service.  Our experience here was fabulous and we enjoyed the entire evening.  Service, food and ambiance!",

We had lobster lollipops and cocktails for a starter.  My Chopin-Vodka Dirty Martini was perfect.  As usual, the Macademia Encrusted Mahi Mahi with a side of rice and the Chocolate Lava Cake (that you have to order at the beginning of the meal) were the stars of the menu...to me anyway.  They're just so damn good, I can rarely bring myself to order anything else...although I have before, and it's all good!  Beautiful view and friendly service.  1 Appetizer, 4 meals, 1 Dessert, and 2 rounds of drinks cost around $250 so prepare for about ~$60/pp or maybe $40pp w/o drinks, appetizer, and dessert.  I would also recommend the Award Winning Clam Chowder and the Mixed Grill.",

The woman in front of us checking at the host stand was told nothing available until 9pm and told she could wait in the lobby until a spot became available in the bar. We were then seated...by the window for a view. He ordered filet and I the pan seared halibut. As we're sitting and waiting for the entrees, we look out and see the grass is extremely overgrown, weeds galore in the rock landscape. They bring the entrees. My halibut lacked flavor AND the shallot butter. Ick. Sent it back, and brought a prime rib after my hubby had almost finished his meal. Never saw a manager. As were sitting there and discussing the woman that was turned away at the host stand, and that there was nothing available until 9 PM we discussed the fact of how empty the dining room was. And what a turn off it was for them to turn her away saying there was nothing available. As we were getting ready to leave and I was waiting by the host stand, There were two calls that came in requesting availability. Again the host told them there was nothing available until 9 PM. I find these things somewhat disturbing when you were spending almost $200 for a meal. I think the Chart House really needs to get it together if they're going to charge these prices. We probably won't be back. #DISAPPOINTING",

We called to make a reservation for the patio which is where we sat last year for our 1st anniversary, but we're told unless you're a party of 15 or more or have a $1500 f&b minimum that they don't sweat out there currently.   So we ask for a window seat.  Being our anniversary they customize the menu with your name...spelled wrong!  1st.strike.  We both ordered a filet; mine with a lobster tail and his with shrimp. Now any other place I've ever ordered a FILET, it's no less than 2\" thick.  Not tonight. This filet looked more like a cut of tbone steak than a filet.  Furthermore the food was not even warm.  But we don't ever send food back...Not a good choice.  The flavor was great as well as presentation.  Just not crazy about cold lobster tail.  The molten lava cake was amazing and Britani ou server was amazing too.  I almost forgot to mention that their idea of a romantic table for an anniversary was was a longer skinnier table with us sitting next to each other.  I love my husband therefore would rather sit in front of him so I can look at him throughout the evening. For a $200 bill, we will go to Dominicks next time.

We were given not only the restaurant week menu, but the regular one and a Gluten-Free one to use as a cross-reference.   We opted to pay extra to take advantage of the salad bar and I am so glad we did. It was delicious. Fresh ingredients. All very cold - which is what I love.   I started with the spinach artichoke dip which was delicious. He had the hummus trio with fried plantains. He said the roasted pepper one was the best, closely followed by the edamame, and the original fell short with too much garlic.   He loved his prime rib and my black and blue salmon was phenomenal. I have never had such a well crafted piece of salmon. The bleu cheese butter and roasted onions brought out the flavor. The rice was meh, but who needs rice when you have salmon like that?   Dessert - he opted for the creme brulee and enjoyed it. I had the mini mud pie and thoroughly enjoyed it.   Service was fine. The manager stopped by our table to double check.   We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I have been coming here off and on for over 20 years.  This will be a short and sweet review.  We ordered the oysters Rockefeller, which had to be sent back as the oysters smelled and tasted like rotten fish.  Our main order was put in wrong, and served our fish with peanut sauces when we specified plain olive oil.  Manager came over and said she was sorry and oysters would be removed but she eally didn't care.  She said there must have been a mis-understanding as to why the waitress delivered the wrong dish.  Nothing was done or anything offered to compensate. Taking ownership and just apologizing would have been a great place to start. The Chart House is a dump. They should be ashamed to have management like this. Food was horrible. Never coming back.  I love the owners reality show but he should make this restaurant an episode.",
