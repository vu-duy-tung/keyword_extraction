    "text": "It is the closest sports bar, so when playoff time rolls around I have to get my fix. But wait, I'm a Red Sox fan. Whatever, I went in anyways not really caring for rivalries. I didn't notice an overwhelming New York vibe or anything, just a table full of hooligans in the booth next to us. I was somewhat amused by the company logo upon looking at the menu. Expecting a gangster Yankee theme, it was humbly a chicken riding a buffalo.  Our server was extremely pleasant, although perhaps had her hands full with the table next to us. My beer ran out and sat there arid for some time, whether that means I have a problem or not it was still a slight buzz kill. I began with 6 Wings and then dived into a Skyscraper Burger- which was absolutely delicious! Being one of the largest items on the menu I had to tackle it due to the nature of my appetite. Although pricey, the Burger is probably worth it and the wings were solid. Massive TV's are everywhere, and it is a very comfortable setting... I liked it and will probably go in again for the upcoming season.",

That, and it's a decent place to sit and hang out with some friends, and maybe watch a game (or 7).  The best part about the wings are all the flavor options.  You don't have to get full orders of one flavor, so I tend to mix and match.  I love the pineapple teriyaki and honey bbq, and the asian garlic ones are pretty good added in for interest.  I'm sure the spicy varieties are great, but unfortunately, I am a wimp.  The celery sticks are even good, none of that not-yet-ripe, inch-long, only-2-pieces business.  I haven't tried any of the other food... I haven't felt the need to do so yet.    There's a patio if the weather permits.  It has its own bar and some TVs, so it's nice if you're there for the sports.  Inside, there are more than enough TVs to scream at.  I shouldn't have written this review so early, I'm going to be daydreaming about chicken wings all day!",

She brought us everything we needed very quickly. We ordered from the 3 for $20.00 menu. THen ordered wings as an additional item. Our appitezer was very good, though way too much ranch. It was flatbread, more like a lavosh cracker with with cheese and bacon on it. Not bad! Our meals were The Chicken Pot Pie, tasted like something you would get on the plane.  The 2nd item was spicy fish sliders. Tasted very much like frozen breaded fish, with lots of tarter sause on cheap white bread. Hey that is what most people like. Our drinks were good as well as the wings.  Good staff, nice clean bathrooms. Parking is wicked and not in a good way.",

To begin, the booth we were seated in had a huge tear/hole in the fabric, dinner plate size. Ordered 2 beers, wings & wedge salad with blue cheese. Beer was fine. Wings were dry, minimal sauce, like they'd been sitting too long. Hubby & I didn't see our server for a few minutes after they were delivered, so decided to eat them. Salad was covered in Italian dressing. Finally found someone to bring us some blue cheese dressing but realized there was too much Italian on it to save it. Got the bill & we were over charged on wings (Tues supposed to be .69@ vs. 1.29@!). Finally got the bill adjusted. My hubby used the restroom & there was a guy in there vomiting, more than once. I thought, pls don't let me be sick tonight.  Used to love to come here to watch games & get quality wings, going to have to find another place to eat. So sad, it really was the only neighborhood bar w/used-to-be good bar food in the area, esp since Nello's left. Since it's a big chain I don't see this place getting any better.",

As for the Company itself, I miss the old days where they had 39 cent wings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I don't like the fact that now (on a regular day) you have to get 1 flavor per 6 wings.",

I asked for a Corona, she comes back with it(no lime no lemon). I then had to wait another five montes for the lime or lemon and the menu. Once finally get to order my food and it comes to my table I get all halves of the wings and 1 drummet! WTH? Now she knows I'm bothered. I send it wings back and just ask for all drummets. When she came back, I apologized for seeming so difficult. Her response was they've been so busy, the chef probably wasn't paying attention. Ummmm....I'm looking around and there's hardly no one in here. Its mid afternoon after lunch and before dinner. It's not even football season. I don't care if It's busy, a good restaurants service should always be a good one.  Once I'm finished with my food and paying for it, I go to the bathroom and it is SO DIRTY! It smelled really bad.

It looked like your average American restaurant similar to BJs/Applebees/etc. I was surprised to see that they had lunch specials: $7 for a burger and fries and ~$10 for a dozen wings. Not a bad deal, too bad the food was just okay.   The burger was small and average. The fries needed more seasoning. One person could finish the entire meal and still be hungry. I ordered 6 BBQ and 6 Honey Hot. The wings were so small and had such little meat, but maybe I'm just used to my plump hormone injected wings. The taste was alright, nothing exciting. Though I will recommend the Honey Hot - sweet with a very VERY mild kick.   Kudos to our server (I didn't catch his name :( ) but he was AMAZING!

    "text": "I went to Native last night for their ten cent wing special. I actually stopped at two locations before this that were much closer to me but they had stopped letting people be seated at 8pm. I drove to this location and they did have a wait but to be expected with the great deal they were having. I had no issues waiting. I was actually super impressed with this location as they managed the line very well and had people seated as quickly as possible. For how busy it was, the employees were all very eager to help. Everyone was very happy and energetic about the deal. I was extremely impressed. We received our wings but they did bring out the wrong fries we had ordered. They quickly fixed the mistake and brought out the correct fries. I appreciated this and had no issue as it was an easy mistake especially with the circumstance. I was just happy to be inside and eating at that point! I will definitely be coming back to this location in the future. I also love the new added items to their menu. They are great!",

Every time I went back it was always the same bad service with either being overcharged for something, not getting the right order, food being lukewarm or not tasting any good. Really miss what this place used to be & won't be coming back.",

But the boneless wings 5/5!!! Anyways an atrocity happened.... I came back from winter break craving the pound of boneless medium wings I usually get and these people changed the batter of the wings on me. THEY CHANGED THE BATTER! It's awful and too soggy and sweet and awful. And I'm sad because they were the only good boneless wings in a mile radius from me. The service was already bad but I'm sad to say the wings are now bad too.",

    "text": "I do not normally leave reviews that are this low, I try to review places I love... but my experience here was so bad I felt I needed to share it. I placed a large order online. I showed up 10 minutes before my pickup time and had a drink at the bar. The service from the bar was great. At 10 minutes past my order pickup time, I checked on my order and was told they were running behind, but my pizzas were currently in the oven and would be ready in about 10 more minutes. After waiting another 20 minutes (now 30 minutes past my pickup time), I inquired about my order again. I was referred to a manager who kind of apologized for the long wait and told me she would look into it. She then told me that my pizzas were just put in and would be done in about 10 more minutes. I waited another 15 minutes and finally received my order. My salads had been sitting for 30+ minutes along with my wings, so my salads were wilted (from the heat of the wings) and my wings were cold to the touch. She then told me that they could remake the wings if I wanted to wait another 10-15 minutes. When I asked how it was possible that my order was now 45 minutes late, she told me she didn't know why, but would figure it out before the end of the night. As an apology, she offered me $20 off my next order (nothing on the $70 current order). At this point, I became angry and just left to avoid making a scene. If you decide to go here, maybe you will be one of the people that they decide to serve in a reasonable time frame, but if they don't fill your order, don't expect them to take any responsibility for it.",

I'm pretty sure one of the employees took it. It had only been an hour, if that since I'd left and I doubt the nice latin woman who was sitting where I was sitting took it.

    "text": "We just moved to Chandler from San Diego and it's been quite a challenge finding our new watering hole. We are huge baseball fans and we occasionally like to go out and watch a game so naturally we tried this place. We have been here several times and I  (personally) have left severely disappointed. I always order the same thing: boneless wings with a side salad. Their boneless wings are complete garbage. You'll receive rock hard bits of \"wings\" and they consider that part of the plate. You might find a couple of pieces worth eating, but if you appreciate good boneless wings like i do,  you'll definitely want to order something else from this menu. My boyfriend always gets traditional wings  (bone -in) and a beer. They never have the beer he wants on draft (modelo especial). This last time we visited, the seating hostess took our order because no one approached our table. She was unclear whether or not she was going to be or server. I ordered a personal pizza (I gave up on the wings) with pepperoni and sausage and my bf got his usual. We received our food fairly quickly (which to me seemed suspect aka suspicious). I did not get the pizza i ordered (I'm not usually picky so I didn't send it back. I don't like being that person, I always feel bad), and my bf's wings were cold and with the wrong dip (he asked for blue cheese and they gave him ranch).  He sent them back, disappointed and obviously frustrated  (he usually leaves Native happy) and he told the girl that they were cold and he didn't plan on paying for them or ordering anything else.   What I can say is that they did try to remedy the situation, took both of our meals off the ticket and offered my bf something else. What we did notice is that the table next to us sent their food back to the kitchen as well. Overall, I have left native disappointed every time we've been here, which has been 5 times so far. And my bf left here hungry.   Im sure we'll be back, there isn't a buffalo wild wings close by and my bf does like their wings,  he just prefers them to be hot and fresh (the nerve lol).",

Also my fiance got a pork slider that was all fat and had to be sent back. The potato skins were half off (thanks to yelp) because I would have been pissed if I had to pay full price for them! But again our server was amazing! Jason had a personality and really took care of us! Definitely a valuable employee since we have to make up for the not so great food!

Once 11:40 rolled around we started to notice tables that came in after us were already eating, no big deal, plenty of TV's showing some old UFC fights. By 11:50 I was curious as to why our food was not out, or at minimal an explanation.  We finally received some of our food orders at 12:00. I fully understand this is a sit-down establishment and not fast food, but 45 minutes for some salads and a couple wings? A few of us had to take the food in a to-go container as we had already spent our lunch hour waiting. On the bright side, there was plenty of parking, and we saw some guy get kicked in the apple sack during the UFC fight. Won't be coming back to this place.

The bread was super soft and was almost like a garlic bread.  Meatballs were cooked to perfection and was covered with awesome melted cheese.  The waitress was super busy, but stayed on point.  Drinks were kept fully and our order came out fast.  Very satisfied.",

Don't remember what I got the first time but it sucked - the second time I got nachos- HOW CAN YOU MESS UP NACHOS?  I don't know, but the native New Yorker knows. This time we came for wing night.  My husband liked it which is why I gave it an extra star.  Buffalo wings were okay, honey bbq wings were okay, buffalo ranch wings were the absolute worst thing I've ever eaten at a restaurant.  Tasted like salt and nothing else. My husbands beer was flat and he ended up giving it to the people next to us. Water was warm.  Restaurant was very hot. Service was not bad.   They replaced our wings when we told them it was inedible.  The waitress said she knows they're not good but a lot of people like them.  This information would've been useful YESTERDAY!    Also, two dozen wings come with the smallest saddest celery sticks ever and no carrots",

The wings are a little small for my liking but you can order them in any quantity and they have a great variety of flavors to choose from. The other main dishes are what you expect, not out of the park but not disappointing either. The menu has a good variety of different dishes to choose from, so you can usually find something to hit the spot. Staff are always friendly and accommodating. Parking can get tough when there is a big game, so be prepared to park across or down the street and walk a bit. Not a big deal just try and avoid the dumpsters, they can be gag inducingly bad.",

Nothing has really changed since they changed the name, but at least they are still giving free entrees on your birthday.  Oh wait..they claim to have new super crunchy fries now, but I would say super salty is a better description.  Not crunchy either. The philly at 8.99 was decent, it had mozzarella cheese and the menu said ribeye..but not quite convinced. The big excitement for me was a fly landing on half my sandwich for over the two second fly limit. They were nice and re - made the other half. Go for Julie and tip her well...she deserves it.",

It was quite the opposite, our wings seemed to be just throw on the platter they serve them on and bathed with cold sauce. The fries were so over done they were like hollow potato straws.

By the time we had gotten our beers they were warm because they had been sitting on the bar and the waitress never brought them over to our table. After that we received our food, all we ordered was wings, just wings, and of course the wings were cold because again, the waitress had forgotten to bring our wings to or table when they were ready in the kitchen. Very unhappy with my experience at this particular location. I have not been into this location since the incident happen and probably would not go back.",

She asked if my friend if she had an \"attitude\" my friend then answered \"no, I have just tried to order a drink with now two people and would just like to order one.\" The bartender then flipped out again, like a child, saying \"I will not serve you because I don't like your attitude\" ??????  It was the most bizarre, unprofessional, honestly ratchet customer service I've ever received from an establishment. Apparently I should have paid attention to the trash reviews. Sad day because my friends and I LOVE Native and have never had a bad experience until this location. Bartender honestly deserves to lose her job.",

My food was cold, the fries were soggy, and the slider had no cheese on it. So a pretty bad first impression. I haven't eaten in the restaurant before but not sure if I'll go back.

Upon walking in for a business lunch there was no one at the host station and it took 7 minutes to even be acknowledged. Once seated it took 15 minutes for the server to take our order. In fairness she had about 6 tables and only looked like 2 servers were working, but the place was only 1/3 full. The bartender also did an excellent job of ignoring the people standing at the door as there was no host. Food mediocre, fries cold, and took FOREVER to get the check and cash out. 1.5 hours for a \"quick\" lunch. I won't be back you made a business lunch with a client very awkward with your poor service on a place I suggested.",

It was decently busy because it was a Friday night. We sat at the bar in the outside patio area. The bartender was busy but super friendly and turned on the game. He was even nice enough to turn the volume on even though I was the only one there watching that game. We managed to get there for happy hour which was pretty good. $2.50 and $3 beers, appetizers for $4, as well as long islands and some other drinks for pretty cheap. The thing that will keep me coming back is the $2.50 Coronas and Pacificos, which are served all day everyday. The food was pretty generic. The buffalo chips were disappointing as was the artichoke dip and the tailgater sandwich. The strippers (or whatever the heck they are called) and my greek salad were were pretty good though. When its hot, the misters make the outside patio so nice. I will come here again to watch a game, drink too many Coronas, and pig out on wings, but pretty much for that reason only.",

The wait staff at this location unfortunately does not do the same, mostly young looking kids who pretty much don't know squat about multi-tasking and being attentive to the customer. If you are going to sit outside in the patio area you should probably try to sit right at the bar where you can get your drinks sooner and not have to wait like 15 minutes for someone to come and take your order. As far as food goes, the wings are always awesome, my favorites being honey hot and asiago parmesan and the strippers, which are chicken strips sold by the half or full pound. Sandwiches are pretty good, but the pizza reminds me too much of food chain pizza, which of course it is. Overall though, its a pretty good place to have a bite and sip a few drinks.",

I know they are famous for their wings but I was not in the mood for them today so I got their Club wrap with fries and a coke. Along with some fried mushrooms. The total was 15 bucks which I thought was a bit expensive for the little bit of food I got, and I could of got the same thing pretty much that was bigger at subway for 7 bucks. Plus that the coke tasted watered down.  Everything was served promptly and my service was good, the decor is cool definitely a good sports bar with TV's everywhere you look.  I will say that the food was OK, but afterwords my stomach hurt for several hours afterwords, the fries and mushrooms were really greasy so not sure if it was the grease or something else, but I would say that I would probably not eat here again if I had a choice.",

Note to parents: if you're bringing your child to a sports bar on a Sunday filled with grown men and alcohol, expect the worst. I went to a NNY in Anthem and loved it. People yell and scream (yeah even bad words =X) and no one gets in trouble. That's the way sports are meant to be watched!   BTW, I know 2 people who got food poisoning from their greasy wings.

We waited patiently 15mins as our thirst quenching beer sat at the bar, waiting to be guzzled, which almost seemed to be a mirage in the distance.

The staff is friendly and always fill up my cherry coke (coke with cherry syrup AND extra cherries.)   As for the women's bathroom, yeah it's small but it's not the worst in the world. There is always toliet paper and soap and paper towels. I've been to some really bad bathrooms before and this was not one of them.  We don't go there for sports, but it's a fun place for your family to sit down, eat food, and enjoy company.",

Whatever, we sat down kind of uncomfortably anyway thinking we were already here lets just go with it. Glad we did.  Yes, the place is sensory overload. So many televisions, the tv screen trivia game that I love so much, and just a really really loud room. I think even if the room were full of quiet people, it would still be loud as shit. So all this aside, we were having a blast.  The food is ok, it's not interesting by any means, but it is tasty, and my girlfriend really enjoyed her house special pizza. They have incredible drink specials including a Jack Hour every day from 10-11 where all jack drinks are stupid cheap.   Driving home in the car we agreed it was our favorite place to hang out that we have been to in a while. We sat for probably 2.5 hours playing tv trivia game, watching basketball, and eating. I'm usually hard to entertain when I am not drinking, but I didn't have a problem here.",

I'm talkin' Tuesdays and Thursdays, getting your butt there semi early and eating wings for cheap. This is yet again one of those places that does one thing well, and when exploited properly, will leave you with nothing to really complain about. The best wings in the house have to be the hot, teriyaki and the suicide wings. I've very rarely had a bad experience with the food, but I will agree that the service can be meh at times, but that's probably because the place is packed with loud and obnoxious college kids most nights. So, if you want a cold beer and some great wings for cheap, Native might be a spot for you on a Tuesday or Thursday night. If you're expecting fine New York dining, you probably want to look elsewhere.",

Their next hot is Mango haberno which we had last time,  its spicy but not as much as Ghost wings. We also ordered Garlic bread and that was tasty too.  They have a wide variety of wing sauce selection. They have other items but we aleays had wings so cannot comment on others. Overall wings were very nice.

Tonight we met Doug, our server who was great, and Marcus the manager who was impressive in his presence and attention to detail. We have missed him in the last ten years, and that's a shame.  Tonight we ran across their Mango Chamoy Tajin wings....a TOTAL WINNER!!  Great job Native!!",

We sat down at 7 and it wasn't until about 8:40pm that the wings were served. I don't mind long waits usually but when the food arrived it wasn't even hot so it clearly was not the kitchens fault. I don't know if the bartender was upset I ordered a tea instead of a drink (as I am in recovery) but her attitude was cold the entire time my friend (who did order an alcoholic drink) and I were there. I've never felt more disrespected, singled out and disregarded at an establishment before.",

    "text": "Arrived with a few friends on a Sunday afternoon and they weren't so busy. They brought us the menus and no waters. They asked if we were going to have alcoholic drinks and we said yes. Then we were asked to provide ids (normal) until they asked us to fill out a form because we were under 30. This form would include our name, drivers license number, date of birth, then our signature. I do not mind providing this information, but my issue was that now my personal information was going to be on a paper that anyone can see and take a picture of. I could see other people's information that were there before me.....  We finally ordered our drinks (still no waters) they took about 15 minutes to come out and we still had not even placed our order and had been checked on before the drinks came out. We decided to leave because we figured that it would take even longer to get our food. I will not be returning to this location. However the waitress did acknowledge at the end that they took long and apologized.   Don't order the Moscow mule either. It should be served in a copper cup and it was given in a regular glass ....",

    "text": "Welp, won't be coming back here again. I just moved here about a week and a half ago. This place is close by and has an outdoor patio. Today was my 3rd time here in a week and I brought my dog. Left him in the car, came in and asked if dogs are allowed on their patio...I got a yes response, just as long as I don't feed him or give him any water. This is pretty standard (maybe with the exception of water) for almost all food establishments with patios. I was there for about an hour without incident when a man comes out that I found out afterwards is the owner. His name was Shawn/Sean/Shaun. My dog barks upon hearing his voice. Mind you, not one single other person is on the patio. Sheauwn asks me if it's a \"service dog\". My only response is that I clarified beforehand to see if it was ok to bring him in. Here's the funny thing; HE IS CERTIFIED. I just don't like to take advantage or flaunt it by any means. He goes inside, obviously to address such an egregious error on the bartenders part, comes back and gives me the, \"it's ok right now line, but in the future, he has to be well behaved. Obviously, he's going to respond to anyone that walks in here the way he did to me.\" Not True, about 4 to 5 other people were there briefly and he didn't do that. Anyways, his entire tone was condescending and just plain ran me off. Their food isn't anything exceptional, by any means, and the only reason I've been back was because of the patio and a few interactions with nice employees. Also, I've been a bartender for 10 years and in the service industry for 20, I know power trips when I see them. This was just not a way to approach your customers and make them feel welcomed in your establishment. There are plenty of other actual dog friendly patios with better food and a warmer atmosphere within a mile of this place.",

He apologized for things which didn't go so well in the past and said there were working on staff training. The past three times we ordered take out they got it right every time.

I've had other items from the menu before (pizza, burgers, etc) and they're nothing exceptional. But if I'm in the mood for wings, Native is my go-to place. I just wish that they still provided moist towelettes for my saucy post-wing fingers...  Technically, I would give this particular location a 3.5, but half stars aren't allowed so I rounded up.

This one is what they call a corporate location.  Meaning, not a franchise.  This is good because somehow they have better service, better food, & better portions.  Their employees are good at what they do.  I need to point out two people there.  \"Chester\" or his real name is Shay, is a great guy.  He knows how to be a great waiter to have.  When he started being a cook, we were sad he wasn't waiting on us anymore!  The reason I call him Chester is he looks like the front man from Linkin Park.  It's okay, cause now we have Alex.  Alex is the man!  Once you get him you'll never want to switch. To be continued....",

Recently, it seems like they changed the recipe for the wings and they are no longer as good. It's almost like there is too much breading on them. The place is still a decent neighborhood joint but I think the quality of the food has dropped over the years.",

Their menu really has something for everyone from pasta to burgers to pizza---lots of choices. The service was slacking a bit...my friend asked for a certain type of beer and the server had to go ask if they carried it which they did. She also took quite a while to take our order in the first place. Maybe she was new, who knows. The overall verdict on the food was good although their \"spiciest\" wings weren't really too spicy at all, very upsetting!",

The grease in which they deep fry everything is 'off' I think - like they haven't changed it out since the 1980s... everything tastes the same and not in a good way. In fact, everything about this place is like a blast from the past - it's like walking into a museum featuring restaurant cliches from 25 years ago.  I felt dirty and greasy just walking into the joint. The entire place is covered in a layer of film that's neither sticky nor slimy, but truly disturbing. The smells emanating from this place both inside and out are all pretty offensive too.   The quality of the ingredients used is all very low. I wouldn't ever recommend coming here to eat. We sampled quite a few different items and they were all vile and made me both regret their consumption and consider regurgitation. The sliders were a joke - how do you make greasy bread? Fries are made more of oil than potato. Pizza puffs are basically a twist on a mozzarella stick only wetter and less healthy (however healthy deep fried cheese could be).    There was one saving grace though - the salads seem to be decent. I won't be returning though.",

However, if you are a non smoker and go there after 9pm'ish when the bar inside closes, you have to sit outside in the smoking gallery.  This peeves me, particularly if you have trashy loud obnoxious people sitting right behind you.  The smoke would be much less offensive if it were an open area, but it's roofed so it just lingers.

Our server (Savanna?) was great at making recommendations and I tried the Big Blue Van - a wheat beer with blueberries and vanilla! Yum!   We had the 10-count wing lunch - and I love that you can split the order with two different sauces. We are both fans of the dry rubs, and loved their new chicken and waffle flavor!  We shared a side salad and order of crispy curly fries, and were very happy.   Now, the wings aren't as big as I remember, but they sure were good!  Lots of TVs to enjoy different sports, and great service. We won't wait so long to come back!",

The wings were pretty good and the  buffalo wings were really saucy (which is great considering a lot of places I find myself asking for more sauce). The pizza was a perfect size to share between two people as well. Decent prices, good food and an overall pleasant experience make Native a place worth coming back to.",

Fountain drinks tasted good, the service was great, and the games were all on TV.. boom 5 stars already.  Pizza was probably the worst I ever had.. undercooked cheese, wet dough, all cheese and topping falling off immediately, and what seemed like 2 handfuls of black olives.. about 2 or 3 per bite.. total nightmare on the pizza so do everyone at the table a favor and just get the wings. Maybe order the pizza well done and only get one single topping with NO black olives lol. Don't let this pizza review deter you, this is a great place to dine in.",

I enjoyed the fact  that you could sit at the bar, a booth or table. They also have a very spacious outdoor patio which has lots of seating and another bar. There are plenty of tv's to watch sports on and see the news also. They play lots of upbeat music and they have nice clean bathrooms. I typically always come here for my first stop on a wing hunt.

If you sit at the bar, there are TVs in nearly every walk in the room and so there is never not a spot to watch. Always a good place to meet up with a few friend and if the weather permits, the patio is not bad either. If you don't want to go out, no worry as Grubhub, postmates, door dash and many other companies deliver.",

There's no minimum amount of flavors per order, so you can get 1 of each flavor if you want! It's different for the boneless wings and chicken tenders, but who doesn't love chicken on the bone?! They also have great weekday specials and reasonable prices otherwise. Check them out!",

I will say the wing sauces and pizza were decent and the restaurant was clean. The manager however took the time to explain his Sinus infection to guests in the rest room...really dude? Come on!

    "text": "Meh on the atmosphere. WHOA to the food.  Went here on a Saturday night with a friend to grab some grub before going out. It was a nice night so I opted for outdoor seating. I did this after seeing the interior of the place. Per the name, I expected to see a place decked out in New York memroblia, photos, newspapers, jerseys, etc. but sadly it looked the inside of a Pizza Hut. Nothing exciting on the walls, just booths and tables. Although the space was big and the bar looked pretty stacked, I wasn't impressed with the inside.  On the back patio, which had iron tables and chairs with a bar playing the Giants game (there's the festivness I was looking for) we ordered a side of Honey BBQ and spicy honey mustard boneless wings. OH SWEET MERCY, they were good. I love me some boneless wings and they were killer. I drank the kool aid and I am now a believer of why this place is proud of their wings.  For dinner I ordered the California Clucker. Chibata bread, grilled chicken, bacon, a mayo of types, and avacado. Served with wide-cut steak fries, it was delish. THe bacon was a little too crispy for me, but the avacado was just smushy enough. I couldn't finish and saved half for a late night snack. Even hours later I was 100& satisfied.   I'd go back here on a wing special night and just eat my little heart out.",

When I was going to ASU this was absolutely the best place I started eating there $.10 wings in high school, and almost can't go to a home game without having them first. They used to be $.10 apiece and they've gone way way way up since then, to the point the price is no different than everyone else. The quality has gone down too. Eating at native is OK, and it's called native now not native New Yorker for some stupid reason, but it's nothing special anymore. The changes were definitely not an improvement unfortunately.",

    "text": "EDIT: The last 3 times I have visited the Broadway location they have screwed up my order.  I had to wait 52 minutes from the time we walked in the door to the time they finally got my food to me properly cooked.  The last time I also had to send the food back twice, and around 5 tables had already eaten and left before my order came.  They took the orders of around 4 tables before us, despite the fact that we had been seated and waiting for a long period of time.  And no, I am not exaggerating, their service really is that poor.  A few Native locations have also shut down recently in Phoenix, so I am limited with my other options as far as where to get wings.  I absolutely hate the service at the Broadway location so I will never return to that one, but I have driven out to the Awatukee location and their wings have been excellent along with their service.  If Native wings were not the best in the valley, I would quite honestly never eat there.  The service is horrendous, the menu pretty much sucks otherwise, and it is hard to admit because I've eaten there for close to 25 years.  My girlfriend hates it, so I've been going to ATL Wings more often because their wings are bigger and they also use a Frank's Hot Sauce blend like Natives does for the sauce.  ATL is slow, but their wings are always perfect.  I'll probably still hit up the Native location in Awatukee a couple times a year, but that's it.  It's sad to see them fall so far from grace, especially over the past few years.  Old Review: This place has quite literally the best hot wings ever created on the face of the earth by man.  It is my all-time favorite food and place to eat.  I began eating hot wings at Natives in the 7th grade way back in the day when Tuesday wings were 15 cents.  I've been eating at that same location for a very very long time, even before the renovations and name change and before the condos were built next door.  It is my favorite place ever.  Over the years they have messed up my orders, but they always fix it when I send the food back.  I am very particular with my wings.  It is the hands down the best wing place EVA!!!",

We both ordered the Club sandwich and sat on the patio. It was hot that day, and I was very new to Phoenix, I actually wasn't living here yet. Anyway we sat on the patio and it was nice, a couple of drunk people (a man and a woman) started to get into it. He called her a horrible name and she got very upset. The manager came out very fast and handled it and then came to use and offered us a round on the house for the situation. HE DIDN'T have to do that but he did, and it was awesome. I have been a fan of this place ever since, I love this particular location it's always nice and lively and the food is always good. We have even gotten a few other people on the place. Oh and they serve one of the Best \"Sex On The Beaches\" I have ever had. So I mostly come here for drinks, but what's better than good drinks and good food with baseball on the TV? All in all I love this place, would give it a five star but the location on Bell is horrible so that effects how I rate them in general.",

It was kind of late (11PM ) So we called the place to see if they would be open when we got there. They said they don't close the kitchen until 11:45 so we drove over there excited. We arrive at the place and they turned us away! It was 11:20 pm we checked. The door says open till midnight so if youre going here just know that they close earlier than they let on.",

She's lucky we were actually over 21! (Only 25) You just got in trouble for this?! Now tonight you allowed a group that was way too drunk to come in. They were seated behind us in a booth. A woman in the group grabbed my back and laughed while I was sitting having my dinner and then puked right next to her booth on the ground. It was clear the whole group was drunk and maybe even more than that, yet not one employee did anything. We had to please ask an employee to clean it up as it was inches from my foot. The group laughed while the woman puked and joked about her licking it up, it was clear she wasn't just sick. We decided to move to the bar so I could at least finish my drink. I ate about 5 bites out of my food but couldn't eat anymore after seeing and experiencing all of that. Our waitress didn't apologize, didn't offer any sort of discount, but worst of all made us feel like we inconvenienced her for moving to the bar. DO BETTER. You guys are going to go down hill if you keep this up. My boyfriend and I used to come here weekly about a year ago, we will not be returning.",

Great special (49 cents per wing) on Sundays during football.   -Smoking area.  Although I quit years ago, this place has an awesome patio/bar area for smokers.  Climate controlled (misters and heat lamps) for summer/winter and new TVs, which are great for watching sports.  The bad: -Management sucks.  The service is chaotic on NFL Sundays, and I asked one of the managers walking by for a napkin, since the food runner didn't bring me one with my wings.  The manager with slicked back hair and the tatts on his forearms blew me off.  My waitress was overworked, but cool.  The staff has to wear these lame jerseys now, which gives this place a more corporate feel, similar to BWW. -Prices.  They have gone up significantly.  Better values at many other places in Tempe.  The rest of the food is mediocre.   -No more trivia.  They quit providing video trivia/poker.  Might as well go to BWW if you are looking for a wing joint that has trivia/poker.  We used to play poker at Native in groups out on the patio, but no longer.",

Gone are the days of nickel wings and $1 beers. Used to have just the classics: Buffalo mild, medium, hot - and 'suicide' for those wanting inferno heat. Now they have 20 flavors of spice from mild to extreme heat, sweet to BBQ to just plain spicy. Also, lots of other items on the menu like pasta, pizza...typical sports bar fare. Food and service is okay for that late dinner or mid-afternoon lunch. I wouldn't go out of my way like I used to, for NNY wings and beer. But will still come back out of nostalgia for extra crispy (well done) battered wings with traditional hot buffalo sauce. RIP, NNY! We miss ya!",

First issue was they forgot my 4th slider even though it had been paid for (Amazon refunded the money) but we had a guest that didn't get their dinner which is a bummer. The second time I ordered, they got the order correct, however, the hot wings I ordered were dry, as of the sauce was cooked into the wing (or they had a dry rub). Also, my honey hot wings were so over cooked that the bone would snap if you bit down too hard. As I mentioned before, I am not a regular of this establishment, but I do feel like their wings are overdone.",

First about the deal - when you buy a drink, wings were only 35 cents from opening to close. My total lunch bill was like $8 and I was STUFFED. How can they afford to sell at prices so low?!  Now about the service - our waitress Rachel was the best waitress ever. She checked in frequently, made sure we were able to take advantage of ever deal available, anticipated when we would be needing a refill, and made sure we wanted for nothing. It was amazing customer service. I wish I could give her 5 stars!  In summary: great food, deal, and staff. What's not to love?",

    "text": "My daughter & went to this Native today for the wing special.  There was a wait when we walked in which I don't mind, busy day.  We sat & waited more than 10 minutes.  A guy walks in alone & he's given the option to sit at a high top table in the bar which he takes.  We were not offered this. So we wait a few minutes more still no table so we ask for menus & sit in the bar area.  Our waitress came right away took our drink order & food order at the same time.  We received the drinks.  Other people came & were sitting in the bar area after us they were all receiving their meals.  We sat there with drinks only for well over 40 minutes & not one person noticed we didn't get food.  Finally my daughter flagged down our waitress & asked if we could just pay for our sodas so we could leave.  She said oh you didn't get your food?  & looked in the computer.  I'm assuming our order wasn't put in.  She didn't charge us for the drinks but barely apologized.  So there's about 50 minutes of our evening wasted.  After we leave I calm down a little & call to speak to the manager.  I'm put on hold for more than 5 minutes.  I hang up & call again & the girl that answers was apologetic but also defensive saving well you know we are busy.  Yes well aware so busy you wasted a full hour of my time & I still didn't talk to a manager.  This Native is closer to us but I'll be driving to a different location if I decide to go back.  Horrible experience.  We gave someone else our business tonight.",

    "text": "My fiance and I came in to have a nice anniversary dinner. When we came it wasn't too busy so we assumed we would not have to wait long for service, especially since we had other plans. We were seated right away, and our waiter Lily brought us our drinks and appatizers right away. But then we had to wait 30 minutes just to get our food and it was brought out from the kitchen staff because it seemed as if Lily forgot she had guests at the table. Then when we got our food, it was COLD and we had to grab another waitress from a different table to fix the problem. Lily still had not come to the table, a man in a blue Natives shirt came to bring our food and to refil our drinks. We had a terrible experience and then after we finished our food we had to still wait about 5 or 10 minutes after we were completely done just to get our reciept which was printed at 10:11 and another 10 minutes for her to bring our change, which was printed at 10:21. We did not get any kind of compensation not even an apology for the long wait. I am very disappointed!!",
