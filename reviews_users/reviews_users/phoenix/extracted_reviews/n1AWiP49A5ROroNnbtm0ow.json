The place was bustling and there was a wait, but we were able to get a seat at the bar. Two things we can recommend- the blood Mary flight and the bacon flight. However our meals were a disappointment.  The biscuits and gravy were sweet-like a lot of sugar sweet. We are probably biased, thinking the gravy would be sausage based, and perhaps a little peppery. No amount of pepper can cure, what can only guess, is a LOT of sugar in the gravy. Same review for the huevos rancheros. Ranchero sauce was disgustingly sweet. We could only eat a few bites. We were never asked if the food was fine when the bartender took two full plates of food away from in front of us. Other than that the service was great. We paid, left and went and got some breakfast. !",

    "text": "A breakfast restaurant dedicated to bacon is a rest idea. You can order a bacon sampler with 8 different types!! Given that it's a new restaurant, there was a 20 minute wait on Saturday morning. We were seated quickly. I had an omelette, which was great. The omelettes are huge as well as the sides (comes with potatoes and choice of bread). It was properly cooked and generous in terms of toppings! The bacon sampler was one of the most awesome ideas I've seen in a long time. Each piece was unique and crispy. So in terms of food, this place nails it. However, the service was quite slow when it came to taking orders, getting silverware, and at the end of the meal. As a result, I've lowered my rating. But, as the kinks are worked out, I imagine the service will improve.",

One thing I HAVE to insist is that you try the Flight mimosas. It's a quad of different flavored mimosas. Trust me. They're amazing. Also try the Flight bacon. Again the half is a quad of different flavored bacons. You can get the full with 8 but we were trying to watch our girlish figure. :)",

    "text": "I had a couple of Facebook friends post pictures of their visit to this new breakfast place so I thought I would give it a try.   I ordered the Eggs Benedict southwestern style (forget the exact name). For $11.50 you get 2 eggs, on top of a piece of chorizo sausage and a green chili slice and southwest style hollandaise sauce. That was pretty good. It came with a choice side so I got the hash browns. They were kind of dry and overcooked. Not the greatest. That's pretty much all you got for that price. No bacon, no toast etc. I don't think I will be back based on the pricing of what you get for your money and although the food was good, it wasn't the best breakfast place around and the best is way cheaper.   There were 2 people in my party and our bill was $36 and one of us only had water to drink, the other had ice tea so figure about $12-15 per plate. They do nickel and dime you for every little thing you want extra of i.e.; small side of salsa for my dried out hash browns.   Next..............",

It.   it was so good. Seriously, so.good. Everything tasted so fresh. The portions were huge[I had to take a box home], and they have Mimosa flights/ Bloody Mary flights[ yum!], and...bacon flights![ I know.I know, it boggles the mind]. O.M.G seriously you guys, so delicious.  i had the Arizona sunrise omelet, and my partner had the Oink breakfast Burger. both were huge, fresh, delicious.  I have no idea what makes some of the reviewers say it was frozen -fromthebaggie- food.I personally felt it was top notch, and while it took a bit to come out, I'm assuming it is because you know..it was BEING COOKED.[Americans are obsessed with no wait time, often nay, usually ,sacrificing quality for speed of delivery].  I found the decor to be country, cute and well-pig- themed, which is kinda what you would expect from a place called the Oink. people having issues with the -decor- actually made me laugh out loud- wow, SERIOUSLY?  We got here sometime after 9 am and there was no wait, however, a wait usually signifies the joint is popular and worth checking out.",

I got the pork confit benedict and every bite was so perfect I don't know how else to describe it. My buddy got the pork confit omelette and that wasn't as good but the pork confit saves it definitely. A weird annoyance was that the table we sat at was really wobbly so it was almost like eating on a moving train and we spilt a lot of coffee but our waitress was on top of the refills so just a minor grief. My only regret was that I really wanted to get the bacon flight but it couldn't justify it but maybe next time.",

    "text": "I have wanted to try this place for a while. Ended up going on a Sunday afternoon, which I don't recommend because it was pretty busy.   The waiting area is tiny and there are only 2 benches to sit on and with people coming in and out it was pretty cramped.  We got seated in about 15 minutes and got a booth. The booth felt small, no give on the cushions at all and barely any leg room. I would not sit in a booth again.   The waitress was nice, brought us waters right away and took our beverage and food orders. The water glasses are small so I ended up refilling another 2 times. I also got the coffee and it was kind of bitter. IHOP has way better coffee, honestly. I will credit them for having flavored coffee creamers so that was nice and countered the bitterness of the coffee.  I ordered the California chicken omelette wth a side of fruit. My partner opted for the Pork Confit omelette and we also were excited to try the flight of bacon because that is what they advertise for.  The food came out really quick, my omelette was okay, not overwhelming but good. The Pork confit omelette was drenched in this dark red sauce that overpowered the dish. Most of it was scraped off. It tasted like a ketchup/tang sauce with some spice. They call it the ranchero sauce and they should put it on the side.  The pork confit omelette didn't have a lot of pork in it so again, underwhelming and overpowered by the sauce.  The flight of bacon was a total disappointment. 5 of the 8 pieces all tasted the same. I could taste some flavor differences in the jalapeno, pepper, and apple cider ones but all of the others, no. The bacon was also average size and thickness. For the price of bacon I would expect thick cut with bold flavor and didn't get any of that.  Overall, this rating is more like 2.5 stars and as excited as I was to try this place, I won't be going back.",

Its gotten so bad that I do an occasional brunch at my house that is off the hook making me wanna open up a catering business... but that's another convo for another day. We had a short wait but the front area can be congested as its only a few seats insides to wait... they will need to figure that out before summer as they are facing the sun in the am making it hot and bright. Got the bacon and mimosa flight and found 3 bacons I would come back for. They overcooked a few which made them taste a lot alike, but still enjoyable. Stuck with the basic pancakes/eggs/bacon plate. Decent size, but kinda wanted more. Plan to come again to try the French toast with jalapeno bacon. We also had the BLT... it needed some more sauce as it was dry, but I think it was because the bacon was overcooked. If your claiming the 'oink' you gotta come correct with how you prepare it... some like it medium, some like it crisp... they probably need to ask 'how do you like your bacon'",

We decided to not go for the specialties and go for tried and True breakfast classics. Can't go wrong with those right? Right?  Omelette was ok, nothing amazing. Home fries were, I kid you not, overcooked to hell and back. They were crunchy...or rather hard...the brown color right before they start turning into lumps of wood and about the same consistency. The biscuit was very obviously not made in house.  The pancakes were decent but kinda ruined by cheap syrup with no option to get real maple syrup. The bacon which is their pride and joy while good in flavor was cooked to a chewy/hard consistency, the worst option neither chewy nor crunchy which is is what most people prefer.  Service was equally disappointing. Our water glasses sat empty for the vast majority of the meal.  Considering the menu prices, this was a rather disappointing experience and I don't think we'll be returning considering there are an abundance of alternatives.",

They only do breakfast through lunch, although I would kill for bacon for dinner.. just sayin. Prices aren't bad for fresh food and to patronize a locally owned business. I'm excited to order the sunrise Benedict today. My husband had it last visit and man did I have ORDER ENVY! I'd like to see bacon flights paired with beer for another exciting explosion of taste.

The food, here, are delicious as well. They do tend to be very busy so if you don't have the time to wait, then this isn't the place for you. Their prime is from 9 -11 am on the weekends. They do try to have a very quick turn around time and the girls are always friendly. I love their chorizo bene...instead of the pattie chorizo I ask for the crumble which tastes better. I also love their burito chimi with extra cheese chorizo on the side. My kids loves their oink French toast, cinnamon roll with a side of the Apple wood bacon. My other half always orders their regular bene. Their California Mac Salad is still a favorite but I feel like it still should be a side. It needs to be eaten with a sandwich or burger. I know there's chicken in the mac but its not enough protein in my opinion. They offer different kids of flights - Bacon, Mimosas, Beer and Bloody Mary. I've done 3 of the 4. My other half haven't tried the Beer...not sure why. We do love their Bacon flights...favorite is the Jalapeno Bacon and I do love their Oink Bloody Mary. This place is one of our go to to place for breakfast. We take our out of town family & friends here and they always tend to enjoy it.",

    "text": "It would be more like 2.75 stars if I could. I'll start out by saying that the service was great. I sat at the bar and our food came out within 20 minutes of ordering, which is pretty usual.  My complaints lie with the pricing with their specialty items.  I got the Bacon Flight, of course, and my favorite was the Jalapeno flavor and my friend liked the Apple Cider version and the Pecanwood flavor. The rest of the bacon \"flavors\" tasted like normal bacon... disappointing for $12, but still a fun idea. My friend got the Bloody Mary flight and I got the mimosa flight. Again, fun idea, but poorly executed in my opinion. They use V8 juice for their mixers and it's so basic, so they should not charge $11...The Bloody Mary flight was a bit better with some unique flavors, especially the tomatillo, cucumber and jalapeno green version. But again, the rest are made with regular V8 tomato juice, so pretty bland.  Another interesting thing, they have no drink menu, so they have to rattle off the flavors of the flights to each person. Seems like a time-waster. In my opinion, I was not impressed enough to return. If you're going to charge premium prices, the quality of your ingredients should be Premium as well, i.e. Fresh squeezed juices and ingredients, etc. Biscuits and gravy were fine, but those are pretty difficult to mess up.  Again, $8.99 for two biscuits and gravy seems a little steep when you only get one choice of side with it, and add $2 if you want eggs with your breakfast, which lets face it, most of us do! Best of luck to those great bartenders though, they were absolutely amazing.",

On top of that the water was murky and not filtered. Told a waiter and she said she would provide us with new glasses...never came back. Didnt even want to try and drink from it. We ordered a 1/2 flight of bacon which all tasted the same...no difference what so ever. Bacon was basic bacon...Very disappointed in our visit and don't believe I will be coming back.",

I ordered a chorizo Benedict with home fries, the Benedict was okay it was warm but not hot. Like it's been sitting back there for a few minutes before our server picked it up. The home fries were stiff as a board like they've been dumped back in the skillet from another order. Waitress never came around to check on us through half way of our food. Since I wanted to exchange my home fries for hash browns I had to walk up to waitress to get her attention. The place didn't seem that busy, they have 4  waitresses on duty. The manager or owner came up and asked how everything was? We told him my home fries were stiff and that's why we replaced it with hash browns. His response was well when you eat the home fries they get chewy. I'm not going for the facto have to eat my food to soften it up. No apologies just trying to make excuses for sloppy cooks. In the end, he did take a discount off our meal.",

There was about a 30 minute wait, which wasn't too bad, since it gave us the opportunity to sit at the bar to indulge in their specialty bloody marys.  They have a great selection.  While we all tried several different ones, I personally can say the ones that I tried were very good.  I selected the regular Oink and Spicy Thai and tried their flight sampler.  I can easily say this will be my place of choice for bloody Mary's...too bad they aren't open at night.  Once we were seated, the place is brightly decorated and we were greeted by our server.  He was friendly and attentive considering how busy they were.  I ordered the BLT w/jalepeno bacon and it was really good.  The bacon was perfectly season and full of flavor.  I can't think of any other way to enjoy a BLT, it had such a great kick.  I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "You can't help but be curious of what this place is when you drive by and see the name. Oink Cafe is a locally owned modern style cafe that serves both breakfast and lunch. The things that make this place stand out is their cocktail and espresso bar that includes a Bloody Mary flight, a 50-50 burger (half beef, half bacon) and of course everything bacon included with many of their entrees. They have eight flavored bacon choices (pepper, applewood, jalapeno, hickory, sugar-cured, apple cider, honey-cured, and chef's choice) that can be ordered as a flight or included with one of their meals. The cafe isn't incredible large, the walls are lime green and the decor includes paintings and mini statues of pigs. Also hanging on the walls are coloring sheets colored by kids (kids eat free M-F with an adult entree and 2 beverage purchase if they color a sheet). Breakfast includes a variety of omelets and benedicts that are centered on bacon. Prices I would say are a tad bit higher than most breakfast places. The 8 bacon flight will run you about $11, which I think it pretty high for a side bacon (even flavored bacon). They offer 4 slices for $6. I got the jalapeno bacon per my server's recommendation with my breakfast. I enjoyed the spiciness of it but wasn't particular overwhelmed with the bacon itself. I guess if you are going to advertise yourself as a bacon joint I was hoping for some good-sized slices of bacon. My service was decent considering my server was covering quite a few tables. I didn't try one of their popular Bloody Marys so I didn't get the full treatment of this place. But overall I found Oink Cafe a fun concept with a possibility for a revisit in the future. Btw... they offer a free Best Maple Bacon Donut on your bday.",

    "text": "When I heard about this place, I know I needed to try it! I love new breakfast places and when I heard they had mimosa flights and bacon flights?! SOLD.  When first arriving at the place the one thing that was super overwhelming was how LOUD it is in there. I mean, sports bar in the middle of the Super Bowl LOUD. I thought maybe it would be better once we got seated but it didn't.   And what's up with the LIME green paint everywhere??  Didn't fit their theme at all, I thought.   While we were waiting for the table, the hostess was not very friendly. We were the only party waiting for a table but soon after we arrived there must have been  6 different parties. It got so busy! And the waiting area is so so small, so it was a squeeze and most parties were waiting outside in the heat but Since it was our first time, I took it as \"wow this place is busy so it must be delicious\"   Once we got seated in a booth, we noted to our waitress that it was our first time at the establishment she didn't even seem to care, didn't explain the mimosa flight flavors when I asked or the bacon flights- which is what the advertise for everywhere. I might not have been able to hear her anyways cause again, IT WAS SO LOUD!   I ordered a mimosa flight and my husband ordered a Bloody Mary. They were both decently priced I thought; but quickly discovered overpriced for what we received. Mimosa flight was really underwhelming, I only really liked two of the flavors, which I can't even tell you what they are because our waitress didn't explain and never saw it on the menu (except the big chalkboard menu in the middle of the restaurant).  My husband said the best part about the Bloody Mary was the bacon it had in it.   As for food, my husband ordered French toast. Which he said was good (not great) portions were good. I got the Tempe omelette, which was drenched in some weird tasting sauce. I ended up scraping some of the sauce off. The hash browns/home fries were good. Omelette was ok.   We would probably go again to try this place one more time before we completely rule it off our list. Definitely wasn't my favorite though.",

Everything on the menu looks completely delicious I has the chimi was way bigger than expected! But the real star of the show for us was the flights. We had a bacon flight and a Mimosa flight. There is something magical about someone placing a plate of bacon in front of you.   The mimosa was more champagne than juice and I am not complaining.   This will definitely become a most stop on my many visits to Phoenix",

    "text": "One word.  Overrated.  We came on Mother's Day and I would expect them to be busy as they were.  We were smart enough to have made reservations and were seated promptly however the kitchen was overwhelmed by the amount of orders.  Our server, while polite, blamed the issue on an order system outage and then further complained that the 18 top and 15 top that were there were really slowing things down. In all, it took us an hour and a half to be served our food. To make up for the delay, we were offered a donut to split among the 4 of us. Would be great if I wasn't on a diet and the tuna sandwich and salad I did finally receive was dry and tasted as if the tuna was a day old.    My party ordered the bacon flight.  8 pieces of bacon for $10.99.  I can buy a pound of bacon, good bacon, in the store for $6 so I don't what is so special about this particular grouping but it's was the first recommendation out of our server's mouth so they must push it as a high profit item.  I get the appeal as a niche breakfast place but a 90 minute wait for food, even on a holiday is something that no restaurant should ever be known for.",

Eight different types of bacon, my favorite was the Jalapeno and Pepper infused. The Chorizo omelette was just OK, the Chorizo dominated the omelette and over powered everything else. The hash browns were very tasty and friend perfectly.   I didn't try but would have liked to was the Bloody Mary board. Four different types of Bloody Mary's including an oink specialty Bloody Mary.",

I am from NM and got a chicken sandwich.... i dont remember the name but it was DELICIOUSNESS... grilled chicken breast jalapeno bacon, pepper jack cheese, cheese on some tellura roll/bun.  Had a side of sweet potatoe fries..had lots to choose from for food and sides.  Everyone in my little group was very happy and are going back with their families.  Can't wait.  Well done Oink!",

Luckily when we walked in we were pleasantly greeted and were able to sit right away, up at the bar (which I prefer). We went in around 11:30 on a Sunday (it's my only day off so I know it's going to be busy) and was greeted by Jasmen. She was very busy when we sat so we just ordered waters and looked at the menu until she caught up on her tickets. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and made the drinks look enticing. I ordered the mimosa flight with four different fresh juices, yum!!!! To eat I ordered the chorizo with green chili Eggs Benedict and my bf ordered the tuna sandwich. I devoured my food, it was delicious! I tried my bf's tuna and it was very light, tasty, and fresh. The only downside was that there was no drink menu or music, but I will be back to try the Bloody Mary flight and have that Benedict again!",

The pancakes were over cooked and when I asked for crispy bacon and it came out normal, they were happy to fix it for me but then I got back the two pieces they were obviously microwaved!!!!. :-( I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 because the hash browns and biscuits were excellent and although I asked for over easy and got over medium eggs they were delicious. Despite it being close to home I don't know if I'll be back. The prices are competitive with other breakfast spots and since that is equal and price isn't a motivator, I'll pick a spot with better overall food quality next time.",

    "text": "We loved the bright and fun environment of Oink. Everyone is very friendly and the variety of flights and Bloody Mary's were a fun surprise and the biscuits were delicious, highly recommend. Most of the food was very good, but the ranchero sauce on the Tempe omelet was a little heavy handed and overpowered the flavor of the entire dish. I'm rating three stars primarily due to the poor service. There were many times that the server forgot to bring things requested and got part of our order wrong. It also took 15 minutes to get our Bloody Marys. Usually I would understand the delay, but the restaurant didn't seem too busy when we were here and typically Bloodys have a pre-made mix. Perhaps our server was slow to put in the order? I got the sense that she may have been distracted, so maybe it was just a bad day. Overall this is a super fun restaurant and will definitely be back!",

I love coffee and drink it black because I like the taste of good coffee. I don't drown out the flavor with cream and sugar. Anyway, the coffee was excellent. We both ordered the \"Flight of Bacon\" (bacon sampler) and we both had the \"Oink Omelette\" which was huge! It contains 5 eggs and is the largest omelette I've ever had in my life. It also has bacon, sausage, ham, and cheddar cheese in it which I could not finish it so I took the rest home. My son finished his eventually and we were both left quite full and very happy. We went to the location in Tempe and I really liked the layout because it's a nice open floor so you don't get the feeling like you're crowded or too close to other guests. I had a chance to see other orders being delivered to the table and everything else looked really good as well. I would definitely recommend to someone who wants excellent food and good portions and I would give them 6 stars if I could. This is now my favorite breakfast spot.",

    "text": "As Oink's namesake would suggest, the emphasis of this popular weekend brunch spot is (not surprisingly) pork.  That said, the menu at Oink is a fairly robust variety of traditional and non-traditional breakfast and brunch dishes.  Bacon flights, donut holes, and a number of so-called \"confit\" dishes round out some of the more unique offerings.  On a recommendation from a friend of ours, a large group of 10 of us rallied to come here around Noon time on Saturday with the promise of a good brunch.  I had anticipated a crowded wait upon arrival and at first it appeared we would have to wait upwards of an hour to get seated.  However, much to our delight the staff at Oink went to work immediately to carve out room for our large group towards the back of the restaurant.  Thanks to some yeoman's work by the staff, our wait was trimmed to just 10 minutes.  Upon seating I perused the lengthy breakfast menu looking for something that stood out.  Oink helpfully labels some of the standout pork items on their menu with the obligatory pig logo so I narrowed my focus there.  The menu item that won me over was the pork confit benedict.  This take on the classic eggs benedict includes the usual toasted english muffin, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce.  But unique to this iteration is the slow cooked pulled pork.  Also got a side of mixed fruit.  Total cost including tax and tip came to about $15.  First bite?  Yeah buddy.  The combo of the egg yolk, pork, muffin, and hollandaise was as hearty as it was heavenly.  Traditional eggs benedict itself probably wouldn't be enough to fill me up, but there was plenty of pork on both muffins to leave me full and happy.  Its probably a good thing I got fruit instead of hash browns as a side, otherwise I'm not sure I would've cleaned my plate.  Big thumbs up for Oink.  They went above and beyond the call of duty to get our group of ten seated quickly despite a long line of hungry customers waiting along side us.  The server was super helpful in steering some of our waffling group members towards dishes she knew they'd like.  And the prices for the portions of food that were served were quite reasonable.  It isn't easy to standout on the breakfast and brunch scene in the Phoenix metro, but Oink brings a good mix of traditional and in house creations to the table.  Yes there's some good vegetarian options here too, but with so many delicious and enticing pork offerings, resistance (at least for me) is completely futile.",

    "text": "Honestly, when I first heard the name of this place, I found it unappealing.  I thought maybe it was a barbeque place, but upon discussion with a friend, found out it was a breakfast/lunch joint.  Ok, now things are getting interesting. We have a serious lack of good breakfast places in this area of town so I though \"why not?\".  I went on a Friday morning about 10:45 a.m. It took me a few minutes to look over the menu, but I decided that I wanted to try the Oink Cafe French Toast since I had perused the menu online just a few days before.   I'd say the restaurant was about 1/3 full which doesn't explain why I waited about 20 minutes to get my food. Disappointment #1. Then the food is room temperature...great.  Disappointment #2.  I was really looking forward to trying this because the picture on the website looks UH-MAZING. Nope. Looked nothing like it. As the server sets the food down, they mention that \"here is your french toast coated in Cap 'n' Crunch\". What?!?!?! I clearly missed that on the menu. I asked is that what it said on the menu? Because I missed that part. She says yes. Hmmmmm. Fortunately, I took a pic of the menu and it does NOT say that. The menu says \"a sweet crumb crust\". I was thinking maybe a brown sugar crumble or perhaps a cinnamon and sugar sprinkling. I don't like Cap 'n' Crunch. Disappointment #3.  Be careful when ordering and ask specific questions.  The presentation was horrible. Very boring and uncreative. The only positive was that the  bacon was thick and tasty even if it was cold.  I guess hence the name \"Oink\".  If you want a platter of bacon, this is your place, but I wouldn't recommend this place unless you don't care where you eat. I can only imagine the service and food if the place was crowded!  Next time I'll hit up Denny's where I know the food will be piping hot, I get a lot more for my buck and the wait is next to nothing. Nice try Oink, but I don't see you lasting long.",

The bacon flight was a fun workout for our tastebuds. Staying with the flight theme washed everything down with some mimosas.",

We'll be back next Sunday regardless due to the great location, excellent food, awesome breakfast booze (mimosa flights will be next!), and fun decor.",

    "text": "Ryan and I came on a Sunday at about 1:40pm. There were quite a few parties still waiting outside. Luckily, we were offered two seats at the bar which we immediately took in order to skip the estimated 25 minute wait.  Looking at other reviews, many people mention service as being one of their complaints. I think sitting at the bar is the way to go then! With the two ladies at the bar, we were always quickly attended to and checked in on. We will definitely be sitting at the bar next time we come in.  There is a check-in offer for 50% off the second entree, but it is only valid Mon-Thur so boo on me for not reading the fine print!   Ryan ordered the bloody mary flight for $11 -- you could choose 4 out of the 6 options on their bloody mary menu! I wasn't feeling a savory drink so I ordered a hazelnut iced latte which was quite delicious.   SUNRISE BENEDICT Chorizo patty and peppers on english muffin with a ranchero hollandaise sauce--this was quite tasty! My eggs on top were perfectly poached. The hash browns I ordered as my side were delicious and on the extra-crispy side, just like I like it.  THE OINK CHIMI I was wavering between this and a few other options so I'm glad Ryan ended up ordering this but I was much happier with my benedict. The chimi was good, don't get me wrong, but it was just too much. The pork confit inside was a little bland -- not as flavorful as I expected it to be. But it is stuffed with potatoes, cheese and eggs so there was a lot to navigate through.   SIDE OF BACON - $2.99 It looked kinda comical to see two limp little slices on a plate lol. Bacon was good though. Probably will opt for a flight next time.  My best advice for anyone would be to sit at the bar! All your needs will be taken care of quickly!",

Prices are decent for the portions they provide you. Opportunities: customer service, our waiter did not check on us often and we had empty coffee cups for most of the meal. It took about 50 minutes to get our food ready after we placed the order, with no coffee this seemed like an eternity. We witnessed the waitress clean the chairs butt section with a rag and then reusing the same rag to clean the table top, that's just not within regulations I am sure.  Ambiance: it was a little noisy and the colors are a bit bright, the colors are fine but the noise levels made it hard to keep a conversation going. Not sure if we will be returning customers if the customer service is not corrected.",

What really got me was the food was slow coming out of the kitchen and it wasn't busy.  About 9 on a Monday morning with 5 or 6 other tables and when our food came out it was lukewarm at best.  I had heuvo rancheros and the beans were barely warm clearly just scooped out of a can with a very light sprinkle of cheese that never melted.   My husbands \"home fries\" clearly just came out of a frozen bag of potatoes - barely warm and nothing special.  In short for their prices food was mediocre.  Our server was friendly and polite but couldn't make up for the slow kitchen and poorly prepared food.  We weren't the only ones - I noticed a table across from us was seated well before us but didn't get served until we were almost done.  Not good!",

The owner stopped by our booth and introduced himself and made us feel very welcomed. Our server Jenn, was there on the spot and ready to take our order. We needed a few minutes, she gladly came back and took our order when we were ready. We had the breakfast special and it was fantastic. our eggs were done perfectly, the hash browns were perfect and the bacon! Well, the bacon was just plain out of this world. I was raised in the mid west and had not eaten bacon that good in quite some time. The only issue was choosing which kind of bacon to have. My friend and I both got different kinds ( honey and hickory), both outstanding. After we paid our check, our fantastic server, the owner and the hostess all thanked us and wished us well. This is a definite must stop for breakfast if you are in the Tempe area. I would suggest to get there as early as possible, the food is so good this place will fill up fast! We cannot wait to go back. Great job Oink!",

Going in with my family, we waited about 15 minutes for a table, normal for a Saturday morning. When we sit down our waitress takes our drink orders, and asks us if we would like a flight of bacon. We get our bacon, and order our food. In the time that we ordered our food, 4 other tables had been seated and received their food. Time goes on, and we have been waiting for an hour, the manager is walking around on his phone, not checking on tables. After about 40 minutes of us sitting there the waitress finally stops and says that they are having issues with the POS printer system. So we wait a little while longer and then we stop the manager at that point and tell him that they can just cancel our order we are ready to leave. As soon as we stop him our food finally comes out. One order was burnt, the eggs were sour. In the end the manager took care of our bill. I am almost positive that the waitress forgot to put in our order. I was really excited to come in here with my family, this morning, and now i am sooo disappointed.",

Because of our disappointment with the hash browns on our first visit we decided to go with the home fries.  Well, the home fries are just small cubes of frozen potatoes that were deep fried - so it's like having french fries with your breakfast.  In fact I did get a couple of french fries mixed in the my home fries.  The omelet was OK but a little over cooked.  Everything was pretty greasy including the omelet (my mouth felt coated with grease after eating).  The waitress was also not proactive in offering to refresh our coffee - we had to ask her twice for some more coffee.",

First of all, the place is now painted lime green and yellow - everywhere - even the booths are lime green.  So it's very BRIGHT!  If you like or love bacon, then this could be your place.  I'm OK with bacon, but I don't care for it on everything.  Overall the food was OK, not great, the service was adequate but you can find better lunch places elsewhere.  I had the strawberry chicken salad, my husband had the cuban sandwich w/ a side of beans and our son had the grilled cheese w/ fries.  The grilled cheese was OK, but you had to pay extra for tomato & bacon on it.  The fries were average, a little limp on the big ones.  The salad was good.  My husband likes spicy mustard, but he said they put so much on it that it overwhelmed the sandwich - so if you order it, I would suggest asking for them to lighten up the mustard.  His side of beans was also very spicy.  He thought they were OK, but he's had better.  They also serve beer, bloody mary's and mimosas.  Overal it was OK, but I wouldn't go out of my way again for this lunch.",

Took 20 minutes to get our food of 2 sandwiches and 1 salad. One sandwich was ordered without tomato and it of course had it and there was about 2 tablespoons of mayo on it. One water refill was offered and then we sat at the table with our dishes piled up waiting for a check while servers continued to walk past us. Would not return.",

Each time I leave thinking I could have gotten a better meal at Dennys. Decor is atrocious, almost hard to sit in. For a restaurant who's name is bacon, the bacon was nothing I couldn't get at the local grocery store, disappointing. Had the Bloody Mary flight, again disappointing. The worst thing of all is the noise. It is SO loud in there!!!!  Again, hard to sit in. Extremely distracting & couldn't wait to get out of there!!!  I have high hopes they read reviews and make some changes as this area is in desperate need of a good neighborhood eatery!!",

When we were seated menus were given but not asked if we'd been in before. We have not. Not being familiar with the menu nothing was explained or even suggested. The server left and came back with our waters. In short time we ordered our food but was not asked if we'd like anything to drink besides water. We ordered the turkey sandwich and Cobb salad to share. We had to inquire to another server status of our order. We had waited a long time for one sandwich and a salad. There was not many people in the restaurant. When our order arrived no extra plates so had to ask. The food was tasteless especially the turkey sandwich, very dry and boring. The Cobb salad was a joke with the side of bacon being two strips not chopped. Really? Not impressed and will not be coming back. If there's one thing you must learn in the food and service business to be successful have a variety of beer selection.",

My friend had the biscuits and gravy which were more southern style then she expected but still good. One kiddo had the 50/50 burger which was absolutely amazing! He ate all of his sweet potato fries which he said were great as well. The caramel apple mimosa was very delicious and I didn't expect that at all. Overall a great experience and I would definitely go back again!",

We were seated right away, which was awesome...but it was down hill from there. 10-15 later we had yet to see our waitress. When we finally saw her she took our drink and food order and disappeared. 5 more minutes pass and we get our drinks. 20 min later we get our food, by this time my husband is ready for a refill, which he gets.   My husband gets a heaping, massive portion of biscuits and gravy, with a side of eggs (HIS were real eggs), which he said was really good. I ordered a breakfast sandwich (offered on a biscuit but I asked for mine on toast) and home fries...I expected too much. What I got was half a sandwich made with liquid eggs (rather than scrambled like I asked for) and ONE piece of bacon broken in half. ONE PIECE. The home fries were way over cooked and had maybe 3 pieces of onion, 4 red pepper and 2 green pepper in them. Midway threw the meal we are both ready for refills and our waitress is no where to be found. After watching all the other waitresses handle their table it is clear we didn't have a great one, because she came out long enough to do what she needed and then disappear.   I really wanted to like this place. They serve 8 kinds of bacon...but instead I left hungry and angry.",

Friendly, fun service (thanks Jennifer!) and of course world class Ham n bacon, served up in many delectable varieties.    While bacon's the star of the show, we were blown away by the home made salsa, as well as the chorizo cheese sauce slathering my breakfast chimichanga.   We didn't drink this time around, but there's good beer on tap and a nice array of yummy-sounding Bloody Marys. I also loved the green tea. Don't worry, there's also other good stuff on the menu for vegetarians and non-bacon fans.  Great food & drink at a good price, served up with a smile!",

    "text": "It was my boyfriends birthday and we're both very passionate in our love for breakfast food  we decided to do brunch here as I had seen posts on social media about their bacon and mimosa flights and it seemed like a great way to start out a day of celebration. We got the mimosa flight (the seasonal apple pie and the strawberry banana were the stars of the show). Then we had the bacon flight (try the jalapeno and the apple cider!). I got the bacon Benedict with jalapeno bacon (and the great home fries!) and he got the breakfast chimi. The chimi was so big that my boyfriend (who's a big guy) barely made a dent. And the cheese chorizo sauce was both of our favorite part of the whole meal (I dipped my fries in it). All the food was amazing and so filling. We wound up actually taking the leftover chimi for us both to have breakfast tomorrow. We had Cassidy and her trainee as our servers. I can't remember the trainees name but they were both very friendly and prompt. One of the big things that kept us from giving five stars however was the hostess who was there while we were being served. She didn't greet us, took us to the table, tossed the menus down and said \"Cassidy will be with you.\" Which was obviously not a good start on our first visit. Later, the server trainee innocently asked what the season was for the mimosas and she answered him in a very short and snarky tone as well. :(   Overall a great place, just don't let that very initial impression chase you off!",

Ignored us when we first came in. She seemed more interested in whatever she was working on at the podium. Finally said a total of one word, \"2?\" Then we waited about 15 minutes before a waitress came around and it was not busy. She was sweet and helpful once she got to us. On my second visit the waitress seemed to have way too many tables or something. She did get our order in and was very pleasant but then we didn't see her again. The manager was there thankfully and stepped in and got our bill. I think Oink really needs to work on customer service. Not sure I'd go back.",

    "text": "So I don't write a bad review unless the situation absolutely demands such a resolution. Furthermore, although this bad review is mostly about the food, I've never written a bad review about someone's service, I figure that's generally the nature of the beast, until today...  Murphy's Law was swinging in full effect. Everything that could go wrong - did. First, the food. My mom and I both ordered a half Cobb salad for $8, the full was $10. But we didn't want a monster, just a good size salad to fill us up. What came out was what I can only compare to a side dinner salad - the tiny thing that restaurants serve to just tide you over until the actual meal comes. You've got to be kidding.   I'm allergic to tomatoes and absolutely hate blue cheese, so I subbed the blue cheese for cheddar and ordered no tomatoes because I was allergic. Of course, got tomatoes, atop my teeny tiny little salad. I gave those to my mom. I went to pour a little ranch on my salad, and it had the same consistency of water, which rolled right off both of my pieces of lettuce. I felt I had to order another ranch and try this again, from maybe an engineering perspective to make this work, the waiter brought me blue cheese.  I poured it on, realized it was chunky, and ruined the small half of my salad that was remaining.   It took 5 minutes to get my waiters attention so I could point out his mistake. I told him \"you brought me blue cheese\" as I suggested a gander down to the chunks on my lettuce. Awkward silence, he wasn't getting it. So I then said \"I asked for another ranch...,\" to which he shrugged and said \"Sooooo..... do you want another salad?\"  Well buddy, you just ruined mine sooooo..... yeah.   Five minutes later, I get another salad, with tomatoes. He sets it down, walks away, and it was then I realized I had left my fork on my old plate. A few more minutes go buy as I attempt to get his attention to get another fork - this must be the most oblivious waiter I have ever seen. I just left it sitting there hoping someone would notice. It was then he brought our check, laid it on the table next to my new salad, with tomatoes, and no fork. I brought all this up again, now making my mom uncomfortable, and said just forget it, it's a perfect storm of events, let's cut this cord and I'll just go. He then proceeded to get another check with my salad off of it.   The hostess came by to get our plates and starts drilling me on why i hadn't touched my salad (the few pieces of lettuce were fine, it was literally everything else that was wrong and not to mention, I still don't have a fork... I really don't like confrontation at a restaurant though, I just don't want to talk about it anymore,) but she kept drilling me! And then started drilling me on the service! I told her \"I don't want anymore confrontation, I'm just going to write a review on yelp.\" She rolled her eyes and kept drilling me, and I said it again, so she rolled her eyes and said \"yeah I get it, you're just going to write a review on yelp. Whatever.\"  And I'm only mentioning this because it's hilarious to think they could get a soda wrong, but they didn't have their syrup/CO2 ratios right, so this whole time, my Coke tasted like gross soda water.   It took forever to get our salads, and I felt bad for the lady next to us at a table by herself in the middle of the restaurant who also sat and waited 20 minutes for service. You could obviously tell she was uncomfortable sitting there - in the middle of the floor, alone with everyone watching her. She looked miserable from this situation! They couldn't maybe seat her somewhere more comfortable or at least expedite her breakfast?!?! I couldn't be the only one who noticed, come on. Common sense isn't common.   You'd get more food and better service at a truck stop. If you want  lunch with a heaping side of 'pissed off' because of bad service, expensive and minimal food, and bad attitudes, this is your place.",

We didn't have any service for the first 10 minutes we sat at our table, but as soon as we did service was great.  Pricing isn't the best. $8 for their signature Bloody Mary and it was nothing special at all.  Their decor is awful... neon green and brown! Huh?? But that has nothing to do with their food - Just the overall ambience we didn't care for.  All in all... it wasn't bad food just nothing special.

It took over an hour to get our food from placing our order.  The unfortunate reality is we were not the only one.  People who were seated prior to us still did not get our food when we got ours.  We let the manager know and he got our food within two minutes of us letting him know and he comped our meal.  The food was less than warm.  Our server was sweet as ever and was incredibly apologetic for our experience.  I would be happy to give them a second chance.  I believe they can make these little corrections and keep their customers happy.  I look forward to the opportunity to have a better experience.",

    "text": "I had such a wonderful experience at The Oink! First the service was superior. Taylor was knowledgeable, kind and didn't rush us. The Assistant GM is making sure everyone is pleased and he's working and helping the staff! They really care about the community! The food is worth the money. If you're looking for Denny's slop  or IHOP's fake over sweet, cheap and over processed foods. Then this isn't the place for you. If you're looking for high quality fruit, eggs, pork, veggies and protein. This is your place. Also their beverages are amazing. We ordered a couple flights of mimosas and bloody Mary's, great! But the kids ordered cranberry juice and they brought out a small carafes of juice! Two times! My only suggestion is the mimosas need to be chilled. I had to add Ice. If the juice,  Sparkling wine would have been chilled and then served chilled glasses that would have been the topping to the cake. The price is worth it and super good for the mimosa and bloody Mary's. Will be back again, worth the wait, price and the service!",

Let's just say the pictures were deceiving  The waitress was horrible! And the food was not good I would of prefer to have mc Donald's for breakfast to be honest. The waitress kept forgetting our drinks, our food took forever to arrive and the place wasn't even that full, I asked for an iced coffee and I had to make it myself she only poured coffee and some ice cubes on my cup and told me to make it on my own.",

We got a 1/2 flight of bacon and to us, it was very hard to distinguish the difference between them all. It was very disappointing, especially because the cafe is all about pork!  However, we were very impressed with the different Bloody Mary's they offered! We got a flight, and loved it! Our bartender Suzzie was awesome and sweet! We may try to go again and I hope to be able to update this review.",

The food that came was not up to the standard it should have been for an hour and twenty minute wait. The flight of bacon was OK, not worth $10 at all. The eggs benidict had hollandaise sauce from a packet that I could have made at home. The English muffins it sat on, yeah, have those at home too. The gravy on the biscuits from biscuits and gravy was super thick, not gravy like; finally the scrambled eggs had a slab of \"pepper jack\" thrown in top. The cheese was not even melted. It was still in the shape of the plastic wrap that it had been removed from. I wished I had checked Yelp before we went. It was super disappointing!",

In the end breakfast won and we all ordered different plates. Everything was excellent....Breakfast chimi, omelets, pancakes and the pork confit Eggs Benedict. Well that dish will make you weep with joy!  We made our return plans to try the lunch menu before we finished our breakfast.

Plus, the name just sounds \"Unique\"  The wait time was about 15 - 20 minutes for a brunch sunday and we were happy to wait - no rush! We already knew what we wanted to order and did their Strawberry Cheesecake pancakes, Pork confit Benedict and 5 egg bacon omelet. Their Strawberry Cheesecake pancake was super delicious and we shared it as our pupu style - soo good. I had their Pork Confit Benedict, which was okay just needed a little more of the Hollandaise sauce.  Given that it was a sunday brunch and it was pretty packed in there, I understand service would be a little slower than usual and our waitress kept forgetting to bring certain items that we requested from her - like water, forks, ketchup, and hollandaise sauce. We had to ask the buster if he can help us and he happily assisted us by the time she came back to give us our items, we were done and ready to close out our check and head out.  If we do go back it'll be just to have the Strawberry Cheesecake to share!",

She didn't think they were bad, just that she's had better at other places. I had the biscuits and gravy.  Not a good choice. The biscuits were large but I thought they were overly dry. My opinion on the gravy was even worse. It really wasn't good. Not sure what the meat in the gravy was... some sort of sausage I suppose. Even though there should have been a side of hash browns, they never came. I will say that my granddaughter's pancakes looked great. If you're all about bacon then this is your place. For other breakfast, maybe not.",

Was here on a Sunday, arrived at 10:00 a.m. and the wait for 6 people was 45 minutes. I completely understood as Sundays are busy, so we waited. Once we were seated we all ordered, our food was alright; however, special mention for the Apple Cider Bacon that was delicious. The service was subpar. I speak for our group collectively that this place would have been a lot better and more enjoyable had the service been more attentive. We live all over the valley so some us drove 35 minutes to be there and we decided this was not a place we feel is worth revisiting.",

There is little to no room to check in or wait the 40 minutes it takes to get a seat , which in fact she said it would only be 20 minutes. When finally taken back the hostess explains that they had multiple people call out. It's unfortunate because our food was great and the portions are huge, but the hectic feel made the restaurant really unenjoyable. Props to our server who was efficient at getting our orders in and to the cooks who made our food quickly. If it wasn't for them I would not recommend this place until they have a better system for getting customers through the door and seated.",

Also had the breakfast chimi with pork confit and scrambled egg covered in a chorizo & cheese sauce. Home fries on the side.  Food arrived and I look down at my plate and notice green and red peppers along with onion mixed in my home fries. NOT as described on the menu. Ok. Eat around them. One strike. Chimi looks good. Cut into it and ... You guessed it,more green peppers and onions mixed in with the pork and eggs. NOT as on the menu. Tasted the Chimi and it was awful. Pork confit taste murdered by veggies. Strike two. Ate my bacon and it was fine.  Here comes the manager/owner. He wants to now how things are?  He sees my half eaten plate and wonders. I explain the peppers & onions, not on the menu, have ruined my meal. He explains \"Yeah,that's how it comes. Next time you'll know to order it without.\"  Next time? He doesn't offer to make it right in any way,shape or form. Strike three.  Waiting outside for my wife and the manager/owner comes up to me and says he looked at the menu, nowhere were peppers & onions listed on the menu in my items. He tells me they need to make it as the menu says or print new menus. Still no offer to make it right by me. So absorbed in the business that he forgot the customer.  I will not go back to The Ouch Cafe.",

I wish the colors inside were more reflective of the name/logo, for example, brown, pink, tan, off white would be much more easier on the eyes vs the bright neon green and yellow on the walls which I simply don't understand unless I was at a laser tag place.   I wish they had fresh coffee creamers, fresh butter, I wish my bacon flight was a little warmer, I wish the breakfast burger was more gourmet/quirky/unique.... a chefs creation rather than a fat pork patty slapped on some buns with a sloppy egg and mediocre hash browns. I ordered the wrong thing but apart from the burger I just wish the place was more cool lol, it seems poorly executed to me and far from its actual potential.. more chic more attention to detail and better vision on the little things would make a big difference.   Oh it probably didn't help that when we sat down at our booth the table was very wet from a server wiping it down and consequently the menus were stuck like tape to the table... not a good start mr oink oink u fortunately I won't be back oh yea and don't serve a barrio blonde beer in an IPA San tan glass.. it's just not right, service was on point tho good job there :-)",

We were sat and brought coffee in a quick manner. We placed our order shortly after and this is where things we wrong. We started to see plates come out of the kitchen for tables that had been sat after us-- again, no big issue, we had time and dismissed it. However, after waiting 30 minutes we were out of coffee and thirsty. My friend asked for waters and the waitress only brought 1. She then was not to be seen for another 15 minutes, which led us to share our small glass of water. Finally we were teased by food! The runners came and they had the order for another table. They apologized and proceeded. Finally, a manager happened to swing by- he wanted to offer more coffee. After 3 cups of coffee, a small water, and no sight of food for the last 50 minutes, the last thing we wanted was a coffee refill. We explained to him the situation and finally after over an hour, things were looking up for the food. Our original waitress had been waiting tables around the restaurant during this time and did not check in at all. It's almost as if she was avoiding our table! Right around the 1 hour 15 mark we finally got our food. It was okay. I had come in before and really enjoyed it. Anyways we scarfed it down due to the wait we had just endured. Near the end of the meal the waitress came by and admitted that she never put our original order in. What?!? She said it was too busy. We will give it another shot because we've both worked in food and know things happen but it's quite difficult to wanna come back if our whole day is put on hold because a waitress forgot to hang a ticket.",

There are 4 empty tables just sitting there. Then we see the manager whisper \"who is this couple, they have been waiting awhile\". So I finally get up to go and talk to her about the wait, then she calls my name. When she calls my name she says \"the kitchen is so behind, we just had two workers quit\" uhhh you don't tell customers that!? My friend hyped this place up to me and so I turned to him and said asked \"are you sure this is a good place\". So we sit down and I order a flight of mimosas. The waitress had two other tables sit down at the same time so she was triple sat. So I just see the third table the was sat receive their drinks after waiting 15 minutes for our mimosas. So I get up and go to the manager again and say \"we sat down first and the third table is getting drinks, (the bar is empty by the way so it's really no longer busy at this point) this is turning into a horrible experience, and I told her my friend recommended this place and now I'm wondering why\" she tries apologizing and keep saying they are backed up. I'm in customer service and that is not the excuse you keep giving. So she comes to the table and says our food is coming out now and she apologizes again and says she will pay for the food but not the mimosas. I will never be back to this place. The bacon is as burnt, the mimosas were messy, and the french toast was soggy with blueberry jam\". This place is so overrated please do not expect a pleasant experience because it just won't happen. This place obviously treats its employees the same way its customers. AWFUL! I'm not even the type to put a review like this but it was so awful and I don't want anyone else wasting their time on this overrated joke of a restaurant. Spend your money on a place that appreciates you and their employees!!",

The sandwiches were fine but the 'Cuban', highly recommended, was fatty. My Omelet was over cooked and stingy on the fillings. Ditto on the hash browns. When the waitress asked how everything was we told her nicely, and she said 'so sorry' and left. Would've been nice to see a manager. Almost $30 each couple plus tip. Save your money and go to Denny's.",

They have every kind from maple to pepper to jalapeno bacon. My favorite was the jalapeno, but they are all bacon so they are all delicious of course.   It's standard breakfast aside from that. Everything was good with the exception of the biscuits. I prefer a light fluffy biscuit and these were SO heavy. Solid dough.   The service was great. We had a lovely lady named Susie, who was genuinely friendly vs robotic service at most establishments. I'll be back!",

    "text": "We went here after seeing the \"Bacon Flight\" and other unique combinations on the menu. The bacon flight came out almost instantly (before our food and drinks) so you could tell they just had lots of bacon ready to go and who knows how long ago it was cooked. We really would have preferred to eat it with our meal. The bacon was not piping hot, the flavors didn't match the flight menu, and the bacon was absolutely lackluster. So disappointing.   The bloody mary flight was absolutely delicious, but it took forever to come out, I had to ask and check in on it. This should have come out shortly after we ordered, because it's not something you can get through quickly so it would have been nice to be able to drink them while we were waiting for our food.   When you order blueberry pancakes, you expect to have blueberries mixed into the batter. Not here. The put about 10 blueberries on top of the stack of pancakes. Again, disappointing with the presentation, but the pancakes and ham did taste good.   The pork patty breakfast burger was also lackluster. Huge patty, but a small amount of hash browns and a tiny egg on top. With such a huge patty, you need equally good portions of other toppings, and this was very disproportionate.   Over a $50 breakfast and extremely disappointed. Definitely will not be back.",

    "text": "I said just this morning that i really really wanted bacon for breakfast!! We went over to another retail establishment and saw this place on the way! How fortuitous! So after finishing with my transaction we headed over. They had a 45 minute wait for 2 people at 1130 on a Sunday. Wow! So we had a third errand to run. We put our name down and hoped for the best! We got back and although they called our name they put us up next. They have an outdoor patio/waiting area. Not sure if they have table service out there or not. The hostess was decidedly quiet/unfriendly. We got no \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day\" when we left. The green-shirted manager was walking around making sure tables were being turned over. I completely agree with both the loud noise issue and the lousy decor. The hubs & i were sitting next to each other and we could barely hear each other. The schizophrenic color scheme is troublesome.  The waitress was nice but the service was slow. We had to wait after we got seated and then waited to have our order taken and then waited for our lunch and then waited for our check...you get the idea. I read another review that mentioned about the kitchen staff bringing out someone's meal using a dirty rag touching their food. I saw that. Ew. Anyway, we ordered mimosas which were good, but small for $6.99. Then we order the bacon flight. Very tasty but again, paper thin like what everyone else has mentioned. I ordered the oink benedict and hubs ordered the pork confrit omelet. Both tasted decent but not *omg* amazing. We got water refilled twice and asked for a box for my leftover sweet potato fries. Lunch was $50 which was a bit hefty. Oh, the bathrooms were clean with 2 stalls and parking was a challenge. All in all, great concept but still have a few kinks to iron out yet.",

You could tell they take pride in what they built and want to make it feel like you're a guest at their kitchen table.    2 - the Ranchero Chimi...big enough to share but so good you don't want to.

Customer service was excellent but it wasn't busy on the week day that we went.  The Bloody Mary was very expensive at $11.00 and packed with ice.  The Bloody Mary had an undercooked piece of bacon in it. You couldn't taste any alcohol.  Don't waste your money on it.  I ordered an omelet that was very strange. Apparently they whip up your eggs and the chorizo together.  Any good chef prepares an omelet fluffy and the other add ins separate. The omelet is then stuffed with the meats and onions etc. cheese is added to inside and out and served.  The omelet wasn't very good.   My husband ordered biscuits with gravy.  The biscuits are hard and taste like flour.  The gravy was not made well either.   We eat out regularly and we are cooks ourselves.  This restaurant had poorly made food that lacked the flavors expected.   Honestly do your self a favor and go somewhere else for breakfast and lunch.",

My dish was not attractive nor enticing... just a big pile of what look like eggs and chorizo thrown in a blender and then cooked in a huge pile on my plate.  The potatoes looked delicious and tasted good.. but the egg/chorizo mess was not appealing... I wish I could've ordered them a different way so it would not look that way.

First off, they have a bloody mary flight?! You've got my full attention after that. I believe they have 6 options to choose from, we liked the 4 we chose, only get the siracha one if you really like siracha though. We tried the mimosa flight as well, I wouldn't really recommend this unless you like sweet drinks a lot. The classic and the cranberry were good but the peach mango and blueberry pomegranate tasted like really sugary juice.   Now for the food! This was honestly one of the best eggs benedict I've ever had! My boyfriend had the spanish style with chorizo and enjoyed his too. We were surprised because this place seems to be known for their bacon dishes.   The decor is super cute and bright and the bathroom was clean. The hostesses were welcoming and the service was good. I liked how they have a bar too even though they only serve breakfast and lunch, you don't usually see that. Definitely check this place out!",

    "text": "After passing Oink Cafe many times on my way to work I knew I had to try them, so I grabbed my son and his friend and off we went. It was Saturday around 12ish so the wait wasn't that bad.  After we were seated I checked out the drink menu, and I was pretty excited to see they had a Verde Mary and knew I had to order one!  Then I checked out the food menu and went with the Bacon Benedict which was a base of an English muffin then jalapeno bacon covered by poached eggs and topped with hollandaise sauce and came with a side of hash browns.  About 10 minutes went by and I asked our server how were the drinks going, and she said oh they are doneI've seen them over there at the bar waiting for me and then she left again, no explanation on if she  she was busy covering someone else table or not, the place wasn't that packed.  A few more minutes went by and the drinks were brought to us.  The Verde Mary  was a house Verde bloody Mary mix and vodka pour into a glass with a salted rim and garnished with tomatillo, jalapeno and cucumber.  This was a good Verde Mary, I just expected more of a tomatillo/jalapeno flavor.  Our order came out, and well I wasn't that impressed, the hollandaise sauce was on point and tasty, the eggs were poached perfectly, but the bacon was burnt as well as the hash browns. Breakfast over all was kind of disappointing. My son & his friend's meal were good though. Maybe it was a busy day before we got there and we just got the tail end of it, I don't know and I am sure I will be back to try them again, I just hope next time would be better.",

We had to wait a bit for service. My husband got the eggs Benedict (pricey) and I got eggs. Of course, we got bacon with our meals but it tasted like plain bacon no flavor. The bacon was cooked within an inch of its life so maybe that's why it didn't taste that great. The waitress was nice but the service was just ok and the food was just ok.

I didn't care for the table location; it was directly behind the hostess stand so I kept feeling gusts of cool air on my back when people would walk in and a lot of employees were rushing back and forth by our table which was a little distracting. Husband ordered the 1/2 flight of bacon (1 honey, 1 pepper, 2 churro) and the biscuits and gravy, and he really liked it. I ordered the three pigs in a blanket. So much food! It was really yummy and I especially loved the syrup.  Service was really attentive. I really want to go back when it warms up a little and try my luck out on the patio.",

    "text": "The Oink Cafe has amazing breakfast food!  I came here this morning around 9:00 a.m. (Saturday morning) with my friend. We were looking to try a new place, because we love exploring new food in the area and came across The Oink Cafe.  Service:  We had the most exceptional service ever! We wanted to share a cinnamon roll, kind of like for a \"breakfast dessert\" after our breakfast, so she went to the kitchen, got the last cinnamon roll and saved it for us in a box and kept it on our table until we were ready for it to be warmed up. So sweet of her. She also made suggestions for us when we were debating on what to order for the menu. She knew the food and based off of what we preferred and like, made a suggestion on that. Our water glasses were constantly refilled and we were never kept hanging.   Interior: The place wasn't too crowded when we came here and we were seated immediately upon arriving. There are booths and also tables and chairs to sit at. Next to the kitchen, there's a huge chalkboard wall with pretty drawings of some of the specials of the day/week. This is a nice artistic piece and unique to the place.  Drinks: They have a great mimosa selection including blueberry pomegranite that my friend tried. They also have a lot of bloody mary choices.   Food:  *The Oink French Toast Combo* All of the combos come with a side of an egg and your choice of sausage or one of their bacons. The waitress convinced me to go for the Oink French Toast instead of the regular one. Texas Toast dipped in their batter and dipped in crushed Cap'N Crunch cereal. The French toast was then topped with a homemade blueberry sauce, strawberries, blueberries, whipped cream, and powdered sugar. I will definitely come back to order this breakfast dish. It was absolutely amazing! I like it when my French toast is dense and a little chewy, well cooked through, and this was just that. The crunch on top added to the overall taste and made the French toast that much better! The warmness of the toast with the coolness of the berries and cream was the perfect combination. It was like a party in my mouth. I ordered the chef's choice of pecan bacon. It was nice and crispy, not too sweet, had just a hint of pecan.  *Pancake Combo* 2 fluffy plain pancakes with a side of your choice of an egg and either bacon or sausage. My friend went with the scrambled eggs and also the chef's choice of pecan bacon. Verdict: some of the fluffiest pancakes ever consumed.  I highly recommend this cafe and would definitely come back again! I'm going to tell all my friends around here to come here because their food is bomb!!",

The menu is NOT overpriced like some other trendy brunch places nearby and the food is all scratch made. We had the breakfast chimi, which my wife loved and I did the pancake combo.  The pancakes were fluffy but. It too fluffy.  Just right.  I added the applewood smoked bacon...I'll attempt to eat my way through the bacon options (8 different types) We got these pretty early so it wasn't very busy, but the trendy music was pumping (not to loud though) and I tell tell it get hopping later in the morning.",

    "text": "Popular place to come to on a Sunday.   We were told it would be about a 25 minute wait, but only waited about 10 minutes so it was a nice surprise. We were seated by a nice hostess then greeted by our very rushed waitress. She seemed very stressed, and it made me stress a bit as well. She asked for our drinks and we asked for waters, because we still needed to look at the menus. As we looked through the menu we also went ahead and decided to have our food order ready just because she looked very rushed. She came by and I decided to order for me and my friend (not something I ever do, but felt like I had to). As I was ordering and getting the the words out she would cut me off which was annoying, because there were substitutions and additions we wanted to do. Finally got my order in ....   First we got our mimosa flight which was really good however when it got to us it was really messy because it was spilled all over. So every time I went to pick up the drink it was wet and it would drip all over so i had to basically clean the mimosa cups. I had already cleaned up around them before I even started drinking them. Then we got the flight of bacon, but the only one that had a distinct taste was the jalapeno bacon the others tasted the same and the presentation again was awful. They brought it out and it was very greasy and honestly did not look very appetizing. They were okay. Lastly they brought out our breakfast entrees and with my omelet I added mushrooms, but no mushrooms were found. My friend ordered a biscuit and got an English muffin with her omelet. There were a few mistakes and the food was decent, but it could have been a lot better and more presentable and less rushed which could have avoided some of these issues I think.",

    "text": "I needed something new and flash for breakfast, but I didn't want to drive to North Scottsdale, so I checked my Yelp app, and found The Oink Cafe.  THE OINK CAFE  The Oink Cafe is on the southwest corner of Warner and McClintock, in Tempe, Arizona.  The Oink Cafe was first opened in Phoenix in 2012, by owners Donnie Baxla, and his sisters, Heather Clauser and Joan Roeber, of Peter Piper Pizza franchises fame.  The Oink Cafe is a scratch-made breakfast and lunch menu, including eggs, omelets, chorizo, biscuits and gravy, pancakes and waffles.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  I have to be honest - as soon as I saw the name, I wanted the place to be adorable, and it was.  Even though The Oink Cafe is in a strip mall situation, the particular corner it's on is quite established, and the foliage is mature, which makes it look less strip mall-y and nice.  The interior is bright, cute, and super clean. I totally love the pig vibe mixed with the edgy raw architecture.  The hostess sat me right away, and my server, Mo, was right over. She took my order very quickly, and brought out everything just as fast.  I tried the 8-piece bacon flight. OH. MY. GOD. SUPERB.  The bacon flight came with applewood, honey, jalapeno, pepper, sugar, hickory, apple cider, and pecanwood flavors. My favorites were the sugar and jalapeno flavors, but all were SUPERB.  I also tried the strawberry cheesecake pancakes. Yes. Yes. All the YES! They were utterly fantastic!  The Oink Cafe also has a full bar, so I sampled their peach mimosa AND their famous Tito's Bloody Mary.  CONCLUSION   Everything was outstanding. I have zero complaints.  I highly recommend The Oink Cafe, and I will definitely be coming back.  5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Plenty of parking out front.  *There are 3 locations: Paradise Valley, Tempe, and Tucson.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Foinkcafe.com&s=0a474655a0977f4579b78b21527c5f1c295b0ff1f480bc1c62d0dbb3115420d4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">oinkcafe.com</a>",

The flavors of the mimosa (blueberry pomegranate, peach, cranberry and grapefruit) were not very noticeable, the grapefruit was the most noticeable.  The wine is kind of dry which personally for me is not my favorite, i like a sweet wine or champagne that is sweet.  I had the breakfast sandwich, was perfect and yummy.  My mom go the french toast and chose the honey bacon.  Now this is where i am confused, i think if you focus on an item then that item should be amazing.  The name is Oink cafe and says bacon on the sign.  They have bacon flights and bacon everything but the bacon is like the kind you would buy in a pack at the store, even the pictures people post make the bacon look mediocre.  I was expecting a nice thick piece with tons of flavor, it was a thin, tough piece of smoke flavored bacon, absolutely nothing special.  Wouldn't go back again.",

I ordered the bacon and spinach omelet and a biscuit. Both were terrific.  It was nice to see a packed house. The restaurant that used to occupy this space was never on a wait list.",

Well, I guess I just needed a place to expand my bacon horizons! My fiance and I got their bacon flight and I've never appreciated this breakfast staple as much as I did in that moment. Now, onto the meal. Ive only been here twice, so I've gotten the chorizo eggs Benedict and the pork confit breakfast chimi. Again, not a huge fan of pork, but my good lord was it delicious. It was smokey, had a little spice, and incredibly filling. I ate the whole chimi. The chorizo eggs Benedict were also fantastic. I've never enjoyed benedict so much before. I've also tried the French toast and waffles since my fiance is more of a sweets for breakfast kinda guy, and those were wonderful too. He also got an omelette once and it was probably bigger than his head! Their portions are a very good size so you'll definitely be leaving full.   So if you're looking for great breakfast, a beer or Bloody Mary, and a very full stomach then come to Oink cafe!",

I called in an order at 10:13, I was literally across the street at a SB cafe relaxing, I walked over at 10:30 am, walked up to the bar, 2 ladies were busy fixing a receipt on the register, 3rd lady was behind the bar, I was greeted for a pickup by a 4th waitress, provided my name, got my check, paid and saw they were busy figuring something out, so I told her no rush. At 10:43, I had to catch someone and inquire about my to go order, the rude lady behind the bar, must have forgotten, she went to the kitchen to check, came back and said it will be a few more minutes, puzzled, I mentioned to her that it had already been at least 30 minutes since I called it in. She countered, I'll check the time, seriously lady, as if I would lie, I held up my phone, smiled and said, phones don't lie! At 10:52, I continued to sit at the bar, waiting, then I had to catch another waitress walking by, asked her to cancel my order at 10:56. The hostess finally came over and was shocked that I cancelled, although she was very nice about it, I informed her of the time and that I shouldn't have to wait over 40 min for a phoned in order. I only ordered oatmeal, side of bacon, Turkado Benedict sandwich. I really wish I was able to taste what they had to offer, but I think 45-50 min waiting time is certainly unreasonable for a phone in, if I were sitting at a table, that would be really ridiculous and the waitress working the bar today, should never have contact with People, better yet, I wouldn't want her preparing my meal with such a distasteful attitude and when I was getting my refund, she still had the nerve to state her opinion with her back turned. I hope management pays attention to the comments, this one the one time I failed to read the reviews for this restaurant, it appears to be an issue with staff and service.",

We shared a mimosa flight (Oink, Spicy Thai, Verde & Maria), the half bacon flight (Pepper, Hickory, Jalapeno & Apple Cider), Pigs in a Blanket with home fries, and biscuits & gravy. Yeah, we feasted lol! We were shocked by the amount of food, particularly with the pigs in a blanket. We were expecting smaller, grocery store-sized sausage links, but we got large hot dog sized links wrapped in huge pancakes! It was all very good, but the homemade gravy and the home fries were the stars for us. The Oink and Verde bloodies were both delish, but the others were so-so; the base mix was completely different and tasted like tomato juice.  Service was perfection, and we thought adding the little note on the flights indicating which order things came in was a really nice touch. The flights are such a good and unique idea for an easy upsell. We will definitely be back!",

The location waiting was right in front of the door so it was really hot every time someone went in or out....  Then we got seated... It was an awkward table that shifted under us several times, and it was in an odd location near the kitchen with servers and guests walk-in around both sides or our table...  However the chairs were much more comfortable than when we were waiting on the bench.   We started with a bacon flight!! Really can't go wrong there... Hubbs and I shared. The cherrywood and peppered were my faves. I also got a bloody Mary flight. The Verde was spectacular! The Thai was nice and spicy but nothing to write home about, the pink was full and robust, and the classic...well, how could you go wrong there. My hubbs tried a mimosa flight... He said he will stick with orange as all the others seems syrup like and super sweet. He also had an Irish coffee. He didn't like the cup (which I loved) I also tried and iced coffee with mocha...it was more like chocolate milk. I took out a mountain of ice...luckily our great server was attentive and thoughtful, and topped off my coffee with all that extra mocha it really was enough for like 3 drinks... Now for the food. I had the oi k omlette. It was good. HUGE portion sizes!! I liked the hashbrowns and biscuit a lot. Hubbs got chicken fried steak (he ate about half which means he wasn't really a fan) I took a bite... It was meh...except the Gravy! Wow was that delicious!!!  Service was wonderful! I mean there is no substitute for good service. Over all an okay place. I would deff come back to try lunch. Prices are a bit high, but as mentioned previously they are huge portion sizes.",

The flight sampler was a very nice addition to try and I recommend it if you are a bacon freak! The jalapeno bacon had a nice little punch and was extremely tasty. I ordered the single waffle with strawberries and whip cream. The waffle was good the syrup was thick and old fashioned. I also tried a few pieces of French toast, The toast however was not crunchy even though we asked the waiter to make sure it was. The overall experience was good and I probably would revisit this location again in the future.",

I would be ok if I spent $11 on a plate of food I couldn't finish and organic or something special. We got the Flight of Bacon of course- $12 for 8 slices btw. Not bad tasting bacon either. So that was a plus, I got the French toast combo- small serving on a big plate. Hubs got the Pancake combo- 2 big pancakes 2 patties and 1 egg (really)..   Me personally I would not come back. Overpriced and subpar food. The coffee was ok though.",

I love the fact that they embrace the entire breakfast pig theme! Inside, the walls are decorated with artistic pieces of adorable pigs, and a wall full of kid's coloring of \"Bacon the Pig\". I'd say it's worth spending some time looking at this wall. Some of the colorings are pretty hilarious.   I got the traditional breakfast of two eggs plus bacon, because you got to try their bacon. Their bacon ranges from the traditional applewood to more interesting flavors such as honey curd or apple cider. Overall, the food was alright. What really sells this place is the atmosphere and service you get here! I will definitely come back to try some more bacon!",

    "text": "My friend, who's still in the dating scene, complained in the manner of a question - what's with women and brunch?  \"Hey, I happen to like brunch!\" I retorted.  I either work through the night on Friday evenings, and have Saturday morning brunch with my wife, when I get home. Or I get up late on Saturdays, and have brunch with her and/or my daughters.  Either way, it's about as close as I will ever get to eating breakfast; which rarely happens.  We had driven past this place several times in the past, and always wondered what their bacon was like. If you have't already figured out the \"oink\" inference, their specialty is their varied assortment of bacon strips.  Yes, it's a breakfast / lunch / brunch joint, with a specific specialization!  We journeyed to this place more out of curiosity,  as there are a myriad of breakfast places along the way.   it didn't take long for us to get seated even though the place was bustling. Speaking of bustling, you'll immediately notice the above average noise levels with all those patrons conversing about.  I ordered the Veggie Omelette, with pancakes, along with a side of bacon. My wife ordered the French toast with a side of bacon. For good measure, we also ordered another side of bacon. We tried various kinds, but the honey bacon was our favorite. It's probably because of our sweet tooth.   All their bacons were light, crispy and absolutely delicious. None were overdone, and not too greasy either. They definitely properly strained it so that it isn't laden with grease before it is served.  Our main courses were relegated to obscurity, as far as we were concerned. In spite of our tremendous lauding of the bacon, the omelette and the French toast were not very impressive. The pancake was quite flat and not fluffy at all inside. My pancake had the flat consistency of cardboard with every bite I took. It was definitely not my favorite.  All in all, it was a good experience. Although, except for the bacon, their other offerings were not that impressive.",

    "text": "Came here on a last minute quest for Bloody Marys and brunch. A beautiful chalkboard with food art really stands out when you come in. The place has a weird feel of country vs trendy vibe. I wish they would just commit to one or the other.   The Bloody Mary's did not disappoint, they were excellent and interesting in their flavors! Did the Oink, Verde, Maria, and Classic. Also did the Mimosa flight, all delicious. Bacon flight, so porking good!  Ambiance is casual, lots of families. Bar is there, but it's kind of small. It's mainly a cafe style set up, but there was a TV playing a soccer game in the middle of the Cafe and one at the bar. Service was good, but our server seemed a little overwhelmed and wound up. Maybe from the morning rush, since we were there later and it started dying down, but still waited 20 minutes to be seated.   Biscuits and gravy had too much batter, you could detect an aftertaste of flour. The Strawberry Cheesecake pancakes were yummy and gave us diabetes. Pork Benedict had great flavor on the pork, the egg was perfect, but I wish the muffin was better quality bread. Portion sizes are hearty.  Total bill was about $75 for three people and the 3 extras (Mimosa, bloody Mary, and bacon flight), so not too bad. I debated between 3 or 4 stars, but the lack of wow with the food entrees and the halfway trendy atmosphere gave me an uneasy feeling, like it didn't seem like a place to get Bloody Mary's and day drink, but it also didn't feel like a country breakfast cafe. 3.5 stars, I wouldn't mind going again just for the flights.",

Unlike some reviewers, I liked the design of the place...bright, upbeat and fun! As for the notice level, it is quite noisy...but not so loud that we couldn't have a conversation. We look forward to our next visit!",

Food is good and bacon lovers dream. However, the staff matter and just are horrible. The manager is really bad as well. At this point I'll go to the Pork Shop and make my own bacon. Restaurants are a dime a dozen we have choices. The owner was on site today and not once acknowledged us. So good luck!",

I play Saturday morning soccer down the street and me and the mates come in after games for some bloody Mary's/breakfast and it never disappoints. I've ordered breakfast and lunch and really enjoyed everything I ordered. For lunch, they have this vinaigrette dressing that comes with their salads and it's amazing. I think they put bacon in it or something so it's probably not healthy but oh well. The benedicts are great too. They have a big selection of drinks including various bloody Mary's, beer and I think other cocktails as well but I haven't ordered any. Looks like a great spot for families and groups. Highly recommended if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Sooo lets just start out with the fact that I really really REALLY wanted to love this place, I mean who could not love a place that served bacon in diff flavors on a platter.   So lets start with the 30-45min waut just to get a table, which was fine, because like I said who couldn't want to love a place with BACON!!! Moving right alongggg we finall get a table and our waitress comes over ( I forget her name) and introduces herself and tajes our drink orders. We were starvinggg!! Along with our drink orders, we went ahead and ordered our omelets with hash browns ( I ordered the omelet with bacon/ham/cheese and my friend ordered this omelet with spinach,bacon??, and cheese)  The food finally arrives and it looks ahmahhze balls as the runner sets our plates dwn in front of us and what do I see as my plate gets closer to me but this beautiful long hair sitting right on top of my omelet ( cue horror music).  Now my friends tears into his omelet and I feel like I'm forced w/ a decision as to not make a scene ( mind you I have a bad case of laryngitis or I've lost my voice) . I politely flag dwn someone and ask if I could get a new omelet, the waitress asks me what's wrong and I proceed to point out the hair on my omelet. She gasps and apologizes andvquickly takes my plate to the back. I don't know about you,  but hair kind of ruins my whole appetite, so to be honest I wasn't even hungry anymore.   So as I patiently wait for my new food I'm left with twiddling my fingers and watching EVERYONE around me enjoy their food, including my friend .  The manager is walking through asking what seems to be every table, but ours how the food is. My good promptly arrives about 10-15 min later as my friend is finishing up his plate and I'm faced w/ an omelet I don't want anymore and no more cranberry juice to get me through. I take a bite of my omelet and I'm ready to bag up my food and go...  I just want this brunch to over already and to get some water or something to hold me over until I get home. The bill arrives and I peak a glimpse of it and see the price, and shake my head in dissatisfaction. I at least thought for the mistake we would be comped the drinks or something.  The waitress takes the check and when she returns she brings over this little box and come to find out it was there signiture maple bacon donut. I was appreciative of her effort and bagged the dinut w/ my meal.   I guess my experience was ruined at one hair, but for his food coming out correct and cooked well I'll give them 3 stars. I'm thinking I may avoid this place for awhile and maybe one day I can try breakfast/brunch again.",

I ordered the apple cider bacon with my breakfast, and I got two shriveled up pieces with a hint of apple cider.  My husband ordered the sugared bacon as a side, and for 2.99, he got two shriveled up pieces of plain bacon.  We expected brown sugared bacon, but it wasn't even sweet.  He ordered the Arizona omelette, which actually looked unappetizing with a mediocre sauce on top.  We decided that this was the first and last time we'll go here.  There are plenty of better breakfast places to go to in Tempe!",

They cover the fact up by lots of whipped cream.  My friend ordered the bacon flight and didnt get the correct bacon types she ordered. The wait staff barely waited on our group.  Waitress pretty much ignoed me in my party of 8. She didnt bother to get me a menu, or when  I asked her for cream for my coffee she did not ever bring me any.  Her service?  It gets worse.  When she comes by to refill coffee, she fills up my friend's (she is sitting next to me) when we both put our coffee mugs next to one anothers simultaneously to make life easier for the waitress.  The waitress fills only one of the cups, ignoring me again, and I am at the end of the table. Perhaps she has vision problems along with her memory issues. Unbelievable, right??  To top things off, ( no pun intended) when she comes by the table later, I ask her for more coffee. Her response?  Wasn't just to me but directed to our entire table via her broadcast that I would need to wait awhile because she was busy. So very rude.    Place is over rated  and who needs the abuse from some bratty waitress girl.  My advice to her is a hangover from Saturday night is no excuse for how you treat customers Sunday morning. Plenty of other choices such as BLD.",

Very noisy with lots of families with little kids. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, even though we could see about 5 tables that were empty and just needed to be cleaned. Clearly if it wasn't someones job to clean a table they were not going to do it. There were even a couple of spots at the bar that were empty but dirty because the bartender wouldn't clean them off. With all these negatives why did I still give it 4 stars. Because the food was delicious and the service was good once we were seated.",

Let's start with the good, the mimosas were well proportioned, the server was sweet, and the place looked clean. Now for reality, the server took 20 minutes to ask us if we wanted a menu and clean the area, when sitting at the breakfast bar. The bacon was thin and overrated. The mimosas were Cupcake Sparkling wine mixed with Tropicana style juice (not fresh in the slightest). They were good but definitely not unique. We had 2 types of Benedict and the hollandaise sauce was so buttery I could not even taste the bacon. Lastly, our pancake was cold and over cooked. I would not recommend oink. This place is below par on so many levels. I recommend the owner change the name to IHOP or Dennys because the quality of food is standard to a chain restaurant.",

Basically your hostess with the \"at home ombre\" hair color and raspy voice. She was the worst. Rude, condescending and made blatant snarky faces. Host and hostess set the tone for the establishment you are visiting,  they are usually the first people you come in contact with. To be talked back to and a big cheesy smile right in my face after being rude is completely uncalled for. If your employees can't leave their attitudes at home then they shouldn't be in the service industry. I will never be back because of her.",

My fiance did try one of the bacon flights, but we were a bit disappointed with the lack of different tastes between the 4 that were chosen. Other than that, we had a good experience, and they have adorable coffee mugs.",

The decor is really cool & inviting, but I felt like I was in a bar on a Friday night. It wasn't crowded but the noise was ridiculous. We had to raise our voices to hear each other talk. Got the flight of four mimosas. The champagne overwhelmed the fruit juices; bad mistake in that purchase. Got the breakfast sandwich, on a biscuit. Very bland. The biscuit reminded me of KFC's as far as the taste, but Oink's biscuit was baaaad. It was very dense & heavy. Another bad purchase. Not worth a return trip. Not even slightly curious if their lunch menu is any better.",

We started with bacon and mimosa flight. The bacon is ok it's fun it comes on a piggy board. The mimosas need some work, don't bother with a flight if they all taste the same. The Oink French toast is ok very very sweet. The shredded pork Omelet was less than what we expected. We would go back and try lunch",

    "text": "I'm racking my mind trying to get to 2-stars...I just can't.    I was very much looking forward to trying this place out and, alas, it let me down.  We'll get to the food in a moment but let's first start with the non-edible issues.  DECOR:  The decor here is striking and not in a good way.  Lime green and yellow with grey wood floors, pink granite tables...it like they designed the place strictly with Home Depot clearance items.  The menu, including the chalk wall, is very well done.  That looks nice.  SERVICE:  The coffee arrived after the food.  The table had dried up jelly on it.  The food runner was holding our dishes with a ratty dishtowel which was touching the food side of the plate.  Gross.  PRICES:  Entrees are in the $11-$15 range for the most part.    You're looking at about $30 for two people.  That's not bad if the serving size is good.  SERVING SIZE:   Very underwhelming for the price.  The bacon, the star of the show here, was paper thin.  But quality matters over quantity...so the ingredients must be top-notch, right?  FOOD QUALITY:  Starting with the coffee, even though we didn't, the cappuccino foam looked like soap bubbles and was poorly prepared in an almost comical way.  The home fries were clearly frozen, bagged potatoes.  The hash-browns came from the same freezer section.  If the hollandaise sauce on the benedict didn't come from a can, they should switch to a canned variety because it was terrible.  The English muffins were thin, store brand quality (and barely toasted).  The eggs were good.  The \"pork confit\" is just pulled pork which was fine.  Both teaspoons of it.       Maybe we ordered poorly?  Maybe we were unlucky?  Maybe the food just isn't good?  Whatever the case, I'd recommend you take your money elsewhere.",

So I took 2.5 flights out of this dumpster fire known as 2016. I had a good Mimosa Flight (OJ, blueberry pomegranate, strawberry, and mango peach), an amazing Bloody Mary Flight (Verde Bloody Mary made with vodka, salted rim, and garnished with tomatillo, cucumber, and jalapeno; Spicy Thai Sriracha made with Sriracha, vodka, salted Sriracha rim, and garnished with jalapeno; The Oink Bloody Mary made with The Oinked house Bloody Mary mix, vodka, bacon salted rim, and garnished with a bacon strip, celery, green olive, lemon and lime; and the Bloody Maria made with Cholula, 100% Agave Tequila, salted rim, and garnished with a lime and chicharron), and a decadent half Bacon Flight (applewood, hickory, jalapeno, and chef's choice of pecanwood). I also ordered the Pork Confit Benedict [Toasted English muffin, Chef's special pork confit with poached eggs topped with hollandaise sauce] and nibbled on some Huevos Rancheros [Two eggs on corn tortillas covered with a spicy homemade ranchero sauce served with beans and a flour tortilla]. Least to say, I had a two-hour food coma before leaving 2016 behind!  The food here is great. My eggs for the benedict were a bit over cooked but the tender pork confit made it easy to forgive the cook. Also, they were super generous with the hollandaise sauce which makes my heart happy (and probably a little clogged). The Huevos Ranchero had a good amount of heat and was flavorful. I'd probably skip the Bacon Flight if I came back.  It was a bit underwhelming but a great concept for bacon lovers.  I'd love to come back to try their Biscuits & Gravy and their Mac & Cheese!  All in all, The Oink Cafe was a great way to end the year. Service was amazing given how insanely busy it was, food was tasty, and the lime green walls were both horrendous and charming. I dig The Oink Cafe! 3.5 stars easily.",

    "text": "This little piggie went to market, This little piggie stayed home, This little piggie went to Oink Cafe, And got turned into a bacon flight!  We got here at 9 AM on a Sunday and there was a 30 minute wait to be seated. Well.... \"Better be worth it\" I thought! It did allow me ample time to browse through the menu. They currently serve breakfast and lunch, with breakfast favorites such as omelets, Benedicts, and more Southwestern offerings such as the mighty breakfast chimi. Breakfast chimi or omelet? Hmm... Well I didn't feel like eating my weight in breakfast today so I went with the pork confit omelet! We also split the bacon flight.  The bacon flight came with a slice each of applewood smoked, honey cured, jalapeno, peppered, sugar cured, apple cider, hickory smoked and pecanwood smoked. Some of the pieces tasted very similar to each other. Out of all the slices my favorite was probably the apple cider due to the blend of light sweetness with the saltiness of the pork. The jalapeno was also notable for its spicy kick and I also enjoyed the applewood smoked bacon due to its light, almost fruity, smoky flavor.  I haven't ordered many items at a restaurant listed as confit so I was excited to try the cafe's version of it. The omelet was a sizable meal, coming with your choice of vegetable and starch. I chose the home fries and biscuit. The omelet itself was decent. The eggs weren't super fluffy and were just slightly too overcooked for my tastes. There was plentiful filling of pork, cheese and onion though. The menu listed it as having jalapeno in it too but I couldn't taste any of it in mine. The confit itself unfortunately was a little disappointing to me. For a meat that's been slow cooked for a long time at a low temperature I was hoping it would be amazingly, meltingly tender. The meat wasn't super tender, but it wasn't tough either. It also tasted bland compared to the powerfully rich red chile ranchero sauce on top. I did enjoy the sauce but felt it overpowered the whole dish because all I could taste was sauce with each bite.  The biscuit was decent and the potatoes with bell pepper and onion were a bit oily but plentiful. We also had coffee which was also decent and was refilled as needed.  Service was average. There were so many people here to serve that I didn't really expect a lot of personal attention here anyways.  Since there were so many people here it was pretty loud in the restaurant. If you're looking for a relaxing place to enjoy and unwind this isn't going to be your spot, at least when it's super busy on Sunday morning.  The restaurant takes up residence where Marcello's Pasta Grill used to be. They changed the decor considerably, to a lime green and bright yellow interior.  The bar is still here though so they do serve beer, mimosas and bloody Marys if you feel like having an alcoholic beverage. They also kept the nicely shaded patio which I'm sure will be a great spot to dine at once the weather gets warmer.  Overall, about an average experience food wise and service wise.",

I didn't want to be \"that girl\" who sends her food back, so I reluctantly ate it.  If it was just me and my fam, I would've, but I was in a group.  Normally, that dish is a \"go- to/ no risk\" sort of dish, but here it's more of a \"stay away.\"  Earlier Feb 2017:  I read reviews and wasn't keen on going when my hubby said he'd like to try it. However, I was glad I went after all.    They had a call ahead list, which helped us with a baby in tow.   Good experience, didn't see the dirty rag touch food, as other had said in their reviews. Maybe the owner made it a point to address it with his staff.   It was a little hot sitting near the kitchen. Could use better ventilation, maybe a few fans or they could turn the AC on a bit more.  Also was a bit loud, as customers had said in their reviews. No music was playing, but for good reason, it would be much louder on a busy day.   Great service from our waitress. She did a great job keeping my hubby's tea filled.   Will be going back to try a couple other items on the breakfast menu.   Oh, and about that crazy green... I know there are reasons they colored their restaurant that alarming color... everyone will talk about it, it will be different & bring in new business. Looks like I'm helping with that marketing, just by posting this.",

Our group had eggs benedict (two thumbs up from our buddies), Denver omelet (excellent), & veggie omelet (excellent).   The coffee kept coming with refills & ditto our water glasses.  Big plus! We noticed a bar area and I think they offered bloody marys but that was too early for us. This place is on our \"return\" list and not all restaurants make the grade. (Tip: If there are more than 4 in your group you might call to get a reservation; although I don't know if they take them.) There is no outdoor seating.  However, based on their popularity I'll bet they will have some in the future. There is plenty of parking.",

Food was ok but I really thought the flight of bacon would be impressive and not scrawny strips that appeared. You'd really want that to be the item that sets you apart from other places but not here. The strips were thin, small and not crisp plus presented on a large serving board that only added to their diminutive nature. Flavors were interesting but nothing I would go out of my way for again. Service was excellent. We were checked on often even though our food came out at different times. Kinda noisy.",

    "text": "Unbelievable. I understand Sunday brunch is busy but this place needs help. We waited for a table for 45 min. Pretty standard on a Sunday, especially since there were 7 of us. No big deal. We were seated and promptly greeted. Drink order was taken and our server ( young lady with bright orange eye shadow)came right back with drinks and set the entire tray on the table. We helped ourselves to our drinks because  she had walked away. No biggie. She came over about 10 minutes later and took our order. We watched her write everything down. The food comes out 40 minutes later. It's now almost noon and we've been here since 10. This is a bit ludicrous  considering almost all of our food was wrong. The food runner had a HUGE attitude. My sister (who's bday it is) said she wanted crispy hash browns and this girl literally rolls her eyes. Seriously? My niece asked for no butter on her English muffin, it came with butter, my bro in law never got his eggs, and I never got my flight of bacon. We had to flag down a mgr and he says...\"I know what happened to your meal and I'm going to take some money off the bill. I asked the owner \". So...the owner was there, knew there were a lot of problems with a 7 top, and yet never came over? That's horrible business. Horrible. I asked if I was going to get my bacon, you know, their speciality? The mgr goes, oh Yeah! But sadly, never came back. Orange eye shadow NEVER came to check on us again. We got the bill, he took 50% off the bill BUT charged us for all the food we didn't get. What an awful experience and I will assure you, this place just lost at least 7 customers plus whoever we all tell.",

The applewood bacon was thick and tough and I could barely chew it, I think had been cooked hours before being served. If you spend over $10.00 on a sandwich I would expect they would season the tomatoes use descent bread and adequate mayo, this sandwich had none of these elements. Not to mention the unprofessional unfriendly hostess and the bright lemon and lime yellow paint!",

    "text": "I would do 5 stars but for two things- it is very loud and my table top was so loose the coffee spilled when they delivered breakfast.  Ok enough of that and  onto something that really matters. I really like Hoosiers and I go to Biscuits because it is close and it is not noisy. Oinks goes in the \"I choose to go there\"  category.   Food- you really can screw up eggs and bacon but every item was perfect. Eggs over medium, crisp bacon, sourdough toast, sliced tomatoes. It arrived quickly, hot, and with a big smile. The coffee is very good and they unobtrusively keep it filled.   Service- from the reception (she asked if I wanted the newspaper) to the manager, Bob, it was on point. Caitlyn was attentive but not annoying by asking how it was all the time. If I looked at her she was right there as it should be. Bob introduced himself and we discussed that bilious green the place is painted and the sound level. Nice guy on top of his restaurant.   Music- I am particularly annoyed by the music in most restaurants. I like music but it is always too loud and not what I like. Oinks has no music and I really like that. Actually it might just be too loud to hear the music.   So good food, good service, welcoming, screaming lime green and loud. I will be adding them to my weekend breakfast routine. You know - breakfast then Home Depot. NOTE I noticed just before I posted this that as people started leaving it got much better in the noise.",

Omelet  was delicious and just enough heat with the pepper jack cheese and green chilies.  Ordered home fries great flavor with onion and bacon.  Service was great, staff very friendly.  Would definitely try again.  One down side- very noisy and hard to carry on a conversation.",

Most of the staff was very \"blah\" and unwelcoming, the hostess didn't crack a smile or polite \"Welcome\" when we walked in.   Our waitress was one of the few who made us feel welcome, although it was busy and she didn't check on us as often as you might want to be checked on. We didn't mind though. She made us laugh and invited us back.   Food was as delicious as last time - turkey avocado Benedict, and bacon Benedict - didn't disappoint. Rating went from 5 to 3 due to the unwelcome vibe I got from the staff. Hope this changes, we love the food.",
