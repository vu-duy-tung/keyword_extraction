    "text": "So, the lady and I were in search of some Saturday night food and couldn't decide on what.  I had the brilliant idea to get on Groupon and was stuck in between two choices:  Rita's and another unnamed Phoenix establishment that we had already been to that is always solid never great.  Well, what the hell, let's give Rita's a shot.  Nice and conveniently located on 35th and the I-10, we find a spot and get in.  Order a few margaritas and they were great.  I'm not the world's biggest fan of the marg but Aaron knows how to hook it up.  Next, we ordered the table side Guac, I got the Playa Bonita, the lady got the Seafood enchiladas.  Everything was OUTSTANDING.  I tried her enchiladas and they were dynamite and I had about 4 different kinds of fish that were all cooked perfectly.  Service was outstanding, food was fantastic, there was absolutely no reason this place wasn't jam packed on a Saturday night.  I suggest you go support a local business that does things right.  I love Pappadeaux as much as the next guy and can say that Rita's stands just as tall next to them in service and food quality.   You won't get the white tablecloth but you will have an extra $50 in your pocket when you leave and be just as satisfied.",

But seeing how most people detest the thought of eating cooked bovine stomach, I can't see how this qualifies as any sort of problem. Oh, they don't serve Coke products either.   Being a south Phoenix native and a menudo aficionado, I'm uniquely qualified to discern good menudo from bad menudo. This is definitely a bad recipe.  The broth has too much of a tomato base and tastes weird. The tripe is overcooked and flubbery.  Overall, it's pretty disgusting.  So if you're having a weird day, with a penchant for menudo and a caffeine free diet Coke, forget it.  Instead, have an ice cold Pepsi and a green chili burrito.  Try their chips and salsa too.  Four stars for the server's gigantic hangers.  Overall, Rita's is a good restaurant but their menudo does suck balls.",

This time around (a Wed night) it just wasn't the same service. Our server forgot things (tortillas) they weren't attentive and when we asked for tortilla's (to be served with our meal) it took a long time to get them and we both got flour instead of asking for corn. We won't let this experience stop us, we're going to try it again and hopefully will have better servers next time!",

    "text": "On this, my 4th time dining at Rita's, I'm having my first meal of the day after 3:30 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon.  I have a breakfast-specific coupon and having not eaten yet at this late hour, called to confirm that  the breakfast dishes are served all day long, so figured \"why not\".  The dining room was an oasis of cool comfort on yet another blisteringly hot summer day.  In the cool quiet of the nicely appointed dining room you would not even be aware that you're practically sitting on top of the 10.    My initial server took my order promptly but returned to inform me my first choice was unavailable, but this turned out to be a good thing as my substitute Huevos con nopales (scrambled eggs with vegetables, including nopales/cactus, house potatoes and tortilla, were absolutely excellent, and of generous portion too.  Service was polite as always, though somewhat absentee, as they clearly had more business than they were prepared for at mid-afternoon.   It was a good thing I and other would-be diners were apparently not in a hurry.  Customers looked to each other in helpless amusement as we waited and waited and waited for our server, any server, to come by.  As one hurriedly passed near me, oblivious to or ignoring one LONG waiting young man on other side of restaurant who had tried repeatedly to flag down a passing any employee passing by for quite some time, I asked the harried server to please help that customer, who came up and thanked me for my assistance and joked good-naturedly about our respective long waits.  Finally, though I'd just had breakfast, it was by now 4:30 p.m. and my heart, mouth, and mind were fixated on having a flan, but alas they were out of that too, so  I settled for sopapilla,  a honey drizzled puff pastry, but it was a hollow (pun intended) substitute for the excellent flan I'd had there before.    While it wasn't a highlight day for Rita's usual level of service, once again the food was excellent, and I still look forward to going back for more.  4 or more for the food, and I'm going to leave it there, regarding today as an aberration in customary quality of service.",

The chile relleno was recommended and just ok. The rice is nice and fluffy...again...I make better at home. Great lard rich refried beans. Now...where the excellence is found...the grilled shrimp dinner WITH potatoes and homemade flour tortillas.  The shrimp is amazig with  crisp quartered red potatoes with salty garlicky yumminess and the tortillas are not those pastey white store purchased blecky things. The service was ok...the gal was new, so you gotta go with that. Super nice though.",

I honestly don't understand why some of the reviews talked about the staff being rude etc... We didn't find that at all. Our waitress was actually nice and checked in on us frequently. Even the gentleman who sat us was polite. My son actually dumped his drink all over and I felt horrible, I was rather shocked how fast a clean up crew arrived and I mean crew 3 of them, even moved us to another table which was nice. The prices are a little higher than other places... The food was good nothing that really stood out good or bad. We didn't really order anything out of the ordinary I had fajitas, the hubs had chili colorado... Kid bean burrito. I wouldn't say I'd never go back but it wouldn't be my first choice.",

I ended up with a steak taco & a grilled shrimp, both cooked perfectly.  They have an extended happy hour with great deals on drinks.  Nice ambience, good service and a perfect family dinner!",

It was fresh, hot, and came with unlimited baskets of chips and salsa (our favorite)! Our waiter was one of the best representatives of customer satisfaction and service that we have probably ever seen at a Mexican food restaurant. I truly wish I could remember his name, but he was the only young, confident, and respectful Latino waiter in the entire place, so if you ever get him- he will surely stand out based on his attentiveness and professionalism. I am pretty certain that his name was Alex! Thanks for having such great food and for having Alex on your team!",

However, when you step inside, this little gem looks like it belongs in Old Town Scottsdale.  I made a mistake and order my old standby, shredded beef tacos.  Don't get me wrong, they were okay, but nothing like my GF's order.  She order the steak fajitas which were amazing!  In fact, these are by far the best fajitas either one of us has ever experienced.  They came with all the usual suspects, however they are of the highest quality.  I want to go back and try more items on the menu, but I am definetly ordering the steak fajitas next time!!!  If you like fajitas, you must try Rita's!",

    "text": "It was great to finally get Sonoran Mexican food that showcased Mexican flavors instead of Americanized, cheese-drowned versions of Mexican food.  The Patron margaritas are the real deal and a steal at only $9 as the glasses are enormous.  The Chili Colorado offered lots of meat and a good red chili sauce.  The Pablano Relleno was lightly battered and stuffed with flavorful shredded chicken with a light cheese sauce floating in a plate of red chili sauce, it was the right touch of cheese.    One of the best parts of the meal was the beans.  They are authentic as you get the pork flavor you are supposed to get from beans when they are done right and made with ham hocks or other pork parts!  I didn't ask how the beans were prepared but they taste like they were made with an old school recipe.    We liked the fried ice cream with the cinnamon shell over the sopapillas as they were a little to doughy.  This and the fundillo are the only reasons I am going with 4 instead of 5 stars.  The cheese fundillo was more of a thin Monterrey cheese than the traditional thick Mexican cheese, however, the chorizo on top was excellent.   It wasn't that it was bad it just wasn't what we were looking for in a fundillo.    We are hard to please when it comes to authentic Mexican food and this will be our new go to place as it is unbelievably hard to find good Mexican food in Phoenix/Tempe and this was worth the drive.    We can't wait to go back to try the seafood and grilled carne platters.",

    "text": "We purchased the Groupon for a \"64 oz Pitcher of Margaritas and a Table-side order of Guacamole\".  We paid the $17 promotional price for what is the equivalent of $32.94 value, based on the current menu.  We called Monday evening to inquire about their Happy Hour.  Whoever answered the phone said they didn't have Happy Hour.  Oh well.  We decided to use our Groupon Tuesday afternoon.  We arrived shortly after 4PM to see a Happy Hours sign posted proudly both on the sidewalk and just inside the door.  We had our choice of seating; they weren't busy at all.  The waitress brought chips and salsa to the table.  She saw the Groupon and said she needed to let us know that she would honor the groupon, but that we would also be required to purchase food.  Nowhere on the Groupon is this specified.  She said that's what they're required to do.  We went ahead with the Groupon offer.  Shortly after that we ordered our food.  The margaritas were marginal.  The guacamole was good.  The food was nothing special.  When our check arrived at the table the pitcher of margaritas and the table-side guracamole were listed as charges totaling $32.94, and a coupon adjustment of $28 and change.  When I questioned this the server said they had to charge tax on the Groupon items.  Again, this isn't specified on the Groupon.  I asked to speak to the Manager.  The server said there was NO manager on site.  I told the server she needed to adjust the bill by the $32.94 amount; as charged.  She returned with the adjusted bill.  And, she handed us a paper with the Manager's home phone number and said we should call her.  After settling the tab and leaving the establishment we called the manager.  Her English was very difficult to understand.  But, she essentially threw the server under the bus because she said she was new and didn't know how to treat the Groupon.  Keep in mind the first thing the server did was inform us we would need to purchase food to use the Groupon.  The manager did offer to have us come back for a free meal....too late!!!  Should have been a manager on site to handle these situations.  How many people have they over-charged?  How many people were forced to purchase additional food?  Sounds kinda shady to me.  Try this place at your own risk.",

They had little piece's of celery in the fried rice.  Also, my fajitas had red pepper, green pepper, lots of onions, an tomatoes.  The chicken was very tender.  Also, my husband got chili relieno, an he said they were really good.  They even gave him two big ones with rice an beans.  I don't think  you will be disappointed in Rita's or the staff.",

We were greeted immediately and offered to select our seating preference. The server was able to have the kitchen staff make me a custom grilled fish burro (aka burritos) with rice, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, and grilled vegetables. The tortilla tasted homemade (although not sure if it was). My boyfriend had the shrimp fajitas that were well cooked and well seasoned, and it came with 3 tortillas (also tasted homemade), and he could've ate one more because it was that good. Overall, a positive experience and we would return.",

    "text": "Having lived in Texas for 20 years, and AZ for 10, I have eaten in a lot of Mexican Food Restaurants. My wife and I went to Rita's tonight and I can honestly say that this is the best Mexican Food place I have eaten in in a very very long time.  The Food was excellent (Rocky Point style), the Service was really really good. The salsa is to die for. I ate more chips and salsa than I should have, but it was so so good. I learned that the woman who makes this salsa, has not shared the recipe with ANYONE. It is that good.  First things first, we were greeted with what I thought was your basic typical red salsa and chips. Wrong! The chips were typical but the red salsa was definitely not! Things were great so far. But things got a lot better.  Then we had the Toritos Appetizer: Yellow peppers stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon with a really tasty sauce. Oh my, what amazing taste!  My wife had a beautiful dish named Parrillada del Rancho. The food tasted great, but it came in a Tericotta serving dish. I have never ever seen anything like it before. It added something to the meal that is beyond belief.  I usually come to a mexican restaurant with my pre-conceived notion of what I like. Well I like what I like, and have for a long time. But tonight I decided to get something a little different - I got the Camarones cobijados (Shrimp in a Blanket). Strimp stuffed with crab meat and wrapped in bacon. Yes, as Emeril says pork fat rules. I love bacon. This was really a good call on my part. It was great.  Our waitress was very helpful, she was prompt, she refilled my water glass several times without my asking. Just a great evening. And the best part? I only live about 20 minutes away, and I didn't even know this place existed. Well I do NOW.  All in all, I would give this place 6 stars out of 5.  We will definitely be back.",

Seeing they take reservations, I made one since it was a Saturday night, and we were planning on dining at 6:30.  I was surprised to see the place empty, except for a couple tables, and wondered if Yelp had let me down. Nope! It started with the friendly wait staff. She was very nice and checked with us often, but not too often, to make sure we were ok. The Sangria and strawberry margarita were very good. My Parrillada Del Rancho dinner included a thin slice of steak, chicken, and pork chop. All 3 meats were a slightly overdone, maybe from the grill or the \"cooker\" it was presented on at the table. But tasty, none the less. The other 3 meals were said to be very good, too. Oh, and the guacamole was freshly made at the table, and also very good.  4 dinners, 2 alcohol drinks, guacamole appetizer, and a a fried ice cream came to $132.",

This was my first time back in a long time. My mom and I will never return. The server took a long time to serve our drinks and food. Perhaps our Menudo was frozen and quickly thawed out because it also had a old taste to it. Next time around I'll save myself money and time by buying canned Menudo from Food City and chopping my own condiments. My ice tea didn't even taste like ice tea.",

The margaritas(one house, one frozen sunset) were awesome. I almost never drink them or like them, but I managed to enjoy this one, that says something. The salsa was delicious with a great kick to it. I had the adobada while my buddy had the tampiquena. Both dishes were fantastic, the rice and beans were phenomenal. Loved every bit of it. Nothing was too greasy, everything very nice and hot and came out quick.   For dessert we had flan and sopapillas, both some of the best I've ever had. I can't recommend this place enough. GO GO GO.",

Salsa was delicious and spicy and the chips were warm. The decor was fun, bright and inviting. I ordered my favorite measure of a Mex food place; cheese enchilada, taco, rice and beans. I added a tostada so I could pile on that great salsa. Very very good, tender seasoned meat and bold enchilada sauce. My only complaint is the rice which has too much tomato in it. My husband had the carne asada steak and it was so tender and flavorful. We will be back every time were in the area! We live in Chandler",

They make sure to give great service and satisfy your needs. The food is very fresh, authentic, delicious & they give big portions! My boyfriend and I started with the must have appetizer, Toritos, a yellow pepper stuffed with shrimp then wrapped in bacon with a tasty sauce! (Add cream cheese you will not regret it!)   This place is very clean and has beautiful paintings around,  I am usually not a big fan of most Mexican restaurants but Rita's definitely will be seeing us again!!!   I had the Parrillada Playa Bonita, mixed grilled and breaded shrimp, two fillets of white sea bass, served grilled and breaded chicharones de pescado   Pargo and a lobster tail. My boyfriend had the Fried Tilapia.   Once again, thank you Rita's wait staff and cooks, you have gained a new customer see you soon!",

We were hungry and wanted something quick and close to the freeway (I10) that way we don't lose that much time driving around the Dtwn Phoenix area... and then BAM Ritas was exactly what we were looking for.   Walked in and was greeted right away by the friendly employees.   We opted to take the food to go and eat it in the car since we had our dogs with us.... We did not want to leave them alone in the car plus it was very hot (over 85/90 degrees).  Once the order was placed, it did take about 20-25 mins to get my food which was a bit of a long time to wait... I did over hear one of the girls asking for my order and I think they just forgot to make it otherwise I would have been in and out of there- after all it does not take that long to make machaca con huevos.   In any event, once I got the food darted to my car and ate it then and there. Some of the employees did come out of the back and notice we were eating in the car... LOL they looked so confused and probably where asking themselves what the heck!?!?!? But again had my furry babies in the car and did not want to leave them alone. Did they enjoy fresh chips and tortillas with us.   Service: OK Location: convenient  Staff: Friendly  Food: very tasty  Maybe next time we are in town, we can eat inside- ha!",

Inside, clean and bright and a mix of biz people at lunch, local workers, some families.  Server was prompt, nice and spoke English fluently.  They brought out chips & salsa and the salsa was fantastic... fresh, home-made and had a nice kick.  I chose a $6.95 combo plate - taco, bean tostada and enchilada.  5 minutes after ordering it was served up.  What immediately stood out was everything was simple and light.  The taco wasn't greasy - just some tasty meat, lettuce and white cheese.  The tostada was similar - just a simple base with some really nice refried beans (def not from a can) and crispy lettuce/tomato and white cheese.  The enchilada was good as well.  I prefer  New Mexico style enchiladas, with a really hot sauce, so i rarely order them outside of NM because they are usually bland.  This had a red sauce that wasn't hot, but was definitely homemade and flavorful.   Overall it was pretty straightforward, simple, yet flavorful fare and seemed a lot less heavy/greasy than typical places.  And I'm often fine with greasy, though the beltline would disagree.  I'd defintely frequent the place if it was near, though it's not so special to merit an out-of-the-way trip.  It's a place where they care about making good grub and that shows.  If you're near or going to be in the area, it's worth exploring.",

I would highly recommend!",

Ordered the toritos appetizer and the shrimp were very small and not very flavorful! The pepper was HOT! And it seems like it was swimming in soy sauce! Chips and salsa were ok, salsa was a little fiery. I ordered Chili Colorado, which on the menu came with a choice of red or green sauce. I ordered it with green sauce but Aaron said it came with red sauce. \"It's chili colorado which is red sauce.\" I asked him why it says with red or green sauce on the menu. I love chili verde but never had it with beef. I stuck with the red sauce. The sauce was good but the beef was chewy and a little tough. The dish was quite salty and I happen to love salt, but it wasn't a good salty. The beans literally tasted like LARD! The rice was ok. My friend ordered carnitas which was supposed to be slow slimmered in sauce. Wish I would have taken a picture of it - pieces of burnt pork with no sauce whatsoever! He normally likes burnt meat, but the only edible pieces were the ones with fat! I give this place a two because the other two people in my party liked their food. I get better Mexican food back home in Las Vegas. For some reason we thought we'd be getting awesome Mexican food in Phoenix!",

    "text": "Ritas Arizona is the prime location for Mexican food. We border Mexico and you can find a Mexican restaurant anywhere you look.  So which restaurant is the best in the valley? For me it's an easy question, Rita's. Rita's is an authentic Mexican food restaurant located in south phoenix.  I was taken there by a friend about a year ago and ever since I have been hooked. The restaurant itself is a hole in the wall and does not look like it could serve amazing food. However, when you enter the building the atmosphere completely changes. As soon as you step foot inside you're thrown into a fiesta which highlights the best aspects of Hispanic culture. The smell of salsa and chips fills the room and makes your mouth water. As soon as you sit down your waiter or waitress is there to take your orders and deliver a basket of warm, handmade chips, as well as a delicious bowl of salsa. The food comes out within ten minutes of ordering it! After you finish your delicious food the plate is quickly cleared and you are given your option of desert. The desert menu includes my favorite, fried ice-cream. The fried ice-cream is absolutely delicious and comes with your choice of toppings for free! Again as soon as your done your table is cleared and you are handed your check. No need to sit around and wait for the waitress to come back and collect the check, just walk up to the paying counter and pay your check there. The food itself is cheap, an Entree and fried ice cream is only 12 dollars. As far as Mexican food goes, Rita's is number one.",

We would rate Rita's salsa pretty close to the best salsa we have ever had!  Aaron was also our bartender and he mixed us up two fabulous margaritas.  We had Parrillada del Rancho for Two for lunch/dinner - the price was very reasonable for the amount of food that was delivered!  The platter had freshly seasoned carne asada, grilled chicken breast and pork chop accompanied by grilled vegetables, served with rice, beans, pico and fresh tortilla's.  No way could we eat it all and we definitely left with full tummy's and a nice to go box!  Plus, we felt this was possibly the best Mexican food we have had in the eight years we have been visiting various Mexican food establishments here in Phoenix.  Bravo Rita's!!  We will be back and we will recommend you to our friends and family.",

I opted for a three item combo with a Ground Beef Enchilada, Carne Asada Taco and a Chicken Tostada.  First of all the beans and rice are stellar, very very good .  My Carne Asada Taco had no flavor whatsoever and was heavily over cooked.  Enchilada was very good, chicken tostada was just ok.  Very good salsa with very stale chips.  Table was sticky and menu had food all over it and hadn't been wiped down.  I'd go back again, would just be a little wiser with my selections next time.

We ordered table side guacamole which was pretty decent. The rest of the meal was horrific.  Meats too salty, sauces bland with no real flavors. The food was so bad, we ended up at the pharmacy to buy some  Pepto-Bismol along with some seven up and sprite to ease our stomachs and keep from vomiting. My daughter ended up with the next day being in and out the bathroom all day!! The waitress was super sweet and nice however, but this does not make for good eats! Steer clear of this place.",

Bacon wrapped jalapenos stuffed with shrimp..Bomb!!  for the entree I had Cali chipotle  Shrimp, which was different and tasted so great. My plate had a side of rice and beans (both were super enjoyable!) I had such a great time that me and my bf decided to return...  Second time... We ordered the same appetizers, which in my book were still AMAZING! but the shrimp diablo plate was eh-- It was not spicy and bland. The waitress who assisted us, was not very attentive and would forget to fill up our drinks. I couldn't help but to compare her to our previous waiter Armando, who was beyond exceptional..  Bottom line is... I will not return unless Armando is working",

A few weeks ago, wanting to show a visitor from L.A. that we have great Mexican food in Phoenix, we went to Rita's. Whenever it changed...it was not for the better. The food was thoroughly Americanized--salsas without bite, stale chips, bland cheesy sauces and dshes. An embarrassment",

My main course was the carne asada with a cheese enchilada. The meal came with rice, beans and a salad. My father had the shredded beef chimichunga. The rice and beans were not included with the chimichunga.  The rice is fluffy and flavorful.  The beef in the chimichunga was sweet but had great flavor. The service was very fast. Drinks were refilled very fast. Aaron is a great host and makes you feel like family.  We will be going back and will tell our friends about this amazing place.",

Mind you a decade has passed since then and recipes have changed as well as the owners, today I happen to drive past this place and decided to stop by, still has a nostalgic Mexican vibe to it, friendly hostess , i was promptly seated, I ordered the shrimp tacos knowing it was a long shot I was to get the same one as a decade before.

The waitress took time to talk to us about growing up and eating nopalitos and other vegetables in Mexico, as meat was a rarity. \"Maybe, if you had a chicken, you ate that,\" she said. In any case, it was great that she took time to converse with us about the food. Excellent food and a great atmosphere make this a stop everyone we visit Phoenix.",

The food was okay. I had two ala carte tacos and the carne asada had way way too much sauce and way too many red peppers. The menu didn't explain this. I also had the steak taco and it was buried in onions and I don't like onions; again the menu didn't describe this. Others had the shrimp salad, tacos and chili rellenos.  All gave it a 3 Star. I'm going to try other Mexican restaurants next time we go to a concert.",

Everything looks like it should but it's missing the most important thing of them all and that's taste.   I had a ceviche tostada, and had to pile on the Tapatio just so I could really enjoy it. Out of everything we tried, my favorite was probably the chips and salsa...mainly the chips though, because they were freshly made and hot.  The service wasn't very good either. Our server wasnt very friendly.  When I mentioned my free quesadilla with a check in with the Yelp app, she literally took the phone out of my hand and scrolled around on my phone with a pissed off look on her face lol. Maybe she was trying to check if it was some kind of scam? This will definitely be the last time I come here again.",

The Relleno was good beans good and the osteras where ok. I've had really good oysters so it's very hard to please me with Rocky Point Oysters. I didn't care for them. The flesh was muddy and not clean. It's a good Resturant I like the decor and the waitress was very attentive and nice. Food was reasonable half dozen 7.99/ Relleno 12.99 Ceviche 13.99.

I saw the good reviews, and since I'm pescatarian who wanted Mexican food without having to eat really Americanized versions of dishes, Rita's caught my eye.   This was a great decision. I had the cheese crisp and the seafood enchiladas, along with a margarita. The cheese crisp was way bigger than I anticipated, so I only had two slices before boxing the rest up (easier to save that for the road than seafood enchiladas). It was warm and cheesy and the pico and guacamole were perfect. The margarita was big, pretty, and not too sweet (though sweeter than a traditional margarita), with a refreshing tang. And the enchiladas. Oh, man. The sauce was creamy and cheesy, the crab and shrimp were cooked well, the rice was fresh and light, and the garnish salad was a perfect lift to the dish. Comfort food without being greasy and meaty.   I have nothing else in Phoenix to compare it to, but you should trust me and go there.",

The only reason I'm giving it 4 and not 5 stars, its because their salsa was not all that. Chips and salsa are a big deal for me and the salsa did not convince me, although the chips were delicious.

I'M PAYING FOR IT RIGHT?!) we wait about an hour for our food it gets here and the beef looks horrible! Honestly it didn't even look cooked! It looked like they served it straight from a can! Definitely not cooked at all! I try the rice and it's soooo sweet. Now my house salad was literally 2 leafs of spinach, 1 cucumber, and a drip of ranch! I'm really sitting there like is this real?! I wait another 20minutes for my waiter to come back I tell her to take it back she does and says do you want anything else? Ummmmmm yeah, my check please! So I can leave! And drive far away from this place! Don't even waste your time! Idk how this is a 4 star restaurant! (NO ONE IN OUR TABLE LIKED THE FOOD) the only good thing they had was the chips! The salsa was even sweet! Gross! Gross! Gross!",

A nice mom and pop type of place with a family feel. The variety of Mexican food to choose from gives everyone at the table an opportunity to choose what they really like. The hardest part is to figure out what you want. All of us chose something different. I hot and steamy steak fajitas. My mouth is watering just writing this. The fajitas were amazing. So was my rice which I am very picky about. There rice taste fresh not from the box. The chips and salsa are good too. They serve the chips warm.

It was a little to salty and about the staff I would of appreciated if they came back asking if everything was ok, but they didn't. I was actually excited to go there due to the some good reviews on your restaurant but I wished it was a little more pleasant and employees more excited to work there. I would of asked for something else but due to the lack in timing of the waitress I was to hungry to even wait. Hopefully you continue making changes and it all works out.",

The first time i went for lunch at 1pm...music is way to load, waitresx was one person changed to another petson who took our order changed to another person who delivered our food changed another 3 times , got lost on who to ask for the check.  Felt i got served left overs  Second time took my mother for dinner, music to load, mom had to yell when speaking,  food had too much onions, felt like i ordered onion tacos instead of meat tacos, again a revolving door of waitresses, asked for 2 coffees, never delivered,  asked 2 waitresses for the check. Took too long to get check..Food was over priced!..Could have been better. Gave this place two chances and you know what they say...once shame on you, twice shame on me, BUT NEVER A 3RD TIME!... Restaurant Impossible should stop by and help this establishment.  It has potential  BUT NOT TAKING MY BUSINESS THERE AGAIN!!!",

We had Aaron and it started out great but I had a groupon deal which he pretty much told me was useless and charged for stuff I had already paid for through groupon. I asked him about it and he pretty much said I was being cheap and dismissed my concerns. Needless to say, I will not be coming back here again. That experience just left a bad taste in my mouth. Also...we were a big party and talking to others afterwards, they too felt like Aaron was a jerk to us.",

    "text": "First time here. I have passed this restaurant for years now and I have never ate here. I decides to try it last year after buying a groupon. My groupon expires today just in time before my brothers birthday. Now I have to say it is a nice little cozy place nestled on a corner close to the freeway. Parking is limited. There is a line of spaces in the back of building maybe holds a good to 12 cars against a 3 ft brick wall right by the alley. Don't let the location chase you away.  The building itself is cute lined with arched beautiful windows. When you walk in you can seat yourself someone will come to you and take your order.  The inside is nicely decorated with typical Mexican decor Pancho Villa pictures and all. Not overly done but tastefully done. You will be served fresh hot chips with mmm mmm salsa. I bit spicy maybe for the weak but still full of flavor. We had an excellent waitress and she made sure our basket and salsa was always full along with our drinks. Water is not tap lol so that was nice I was a bit thirsty so didn't mind the refills. We ordered the platter with seafood for 2 you get a salad Mexican potatoes and rice. The platter was abundant with several tasty items sea bass grilled and breaded. Shrimp grilled AND lightly breaded and bacon wrapped and to top off a lobster tail. It truly was alot we definitely could not finish. If you ever are in the area and would like some authentic Mexican dishes stop by Rita's.  The menu will not disappoint anyone there is something for everyone.",

After announcing loudly that he had to (explicit term for using the restroom), he decided to use the ladies room.  He walked in on a woman who screamed. He walked away chortling. Kinda ruined the experience. The bartender should have kicked him out right then, but instead served him up another red eye. $77 for two adults and one 9 year old before tip is pretty pricey for Mexican food. La Pinta margarita is a must try, really good and not too strong. Posole is pretty good. They give you a lot! We'll come back based on location if we ever need a quick Mexican fix and don't mind paying extra for the convenience. The waitresses were all very polite.",

We both ordered the combo plate with 2 shrimp tacos and a chicken enchilada. The shrimp tacos were nothing like they usually are.  Each tortilla had at least 3/4 of a cup of onions and green bell peppers and 3 very small shrimp.  The enchiladas were also filled with onions and green bell pepper and what looked like chicken from those nasty leg quarters you can buy for 39 cents a pound at Food City.  So sad, but we won't give up on Rita's just yet.  Hopefully they just have a new cook for lunch who doesn't know what he is doing yet.",

Food was ok, but there popular steak meat platter is full of dried out, overcooked steak, salsa was good and chips were average.  A big turnoff for me was the waiter trying to upsell everything and trying to get us to buy the most expensive dish. To me it felt like a used car salesmen but it came across fake rather then friendly.  My biggest complaint is we had a groupon for $30 and he would only let us use 27 of it!  The total bill was 33.96 , but he didn't like us using groupon so made up An excuse for not taking it all.   Overall, fair food, poor service, much better options out there.",

I have enjoyed both entrees I've purchased (the carne adobada and the combo with the beef tamale, shrimp taco and chicken enchilada). My husband got a little more adventurous (and expensive) and got the Azteca and didn't care for it. Also have to disagree with other Yelpers on the Toritos. They aren't extremely tasty with the exception of the sauce - and we took the extra sauce home because there was way too much of it and we used it as steak sauce. I wish they would bottle it and sell it separately! Margaritas are also tasty, but not extremely strong. Go and support your local AZ businesspeople. To me, it's better than Valle Luna and many other self-proclaimed \"authentic\" joints.",

    "text": "From Mesa to Tolleson this is by far the best most Authentic Mexican food in all of the greater Phoenix area. They have excellent service, and the food comes out fresh in a very timely manner. Great if you are on a lunch break and time is an issue. Chips and salsa come complimentary, very good salsa. I usually order chile relleno which is great, but I also like the carnitas and the combo platters they offer. It is a smaller restaurant but that is what makes it nice and homely. Anybody looking for great Mexican food should give this place a try. I still haven't tried a lot of the mariscos but have seen the dishes served and they look fantastic.",

The bacon wrapped chili was actually stuffed with 2shrimp as well!  Everything was great! From the staff, the service, and the atmosphere, but the food speaks for itself. Amazing! Can't wait to go back and try more. It does cost a little more than those chain 'bertos' places. But you have to pay a few extra dollars for delicious food. Don't be afraid to just close you eyes and pick something in the menu.  Next time I will try and ask to have my seafood deveined.  Their salsa also amazed me. Tasted homemade and authentic.  Met the owner during dinner and made our experience even better! A great guy! Very attentive and friendly staff!",

They checked back often, and if I wanted more chips and salsa. I had shrimp ceviche, seven seas soup, and heuvos con chorizo. It was all delicious!   Prices were reasonable and serving sizes generous.  Wooden booths, wooden tables and chairs, Spanish music, quick service, sufficient parking. Coming off the I-10, you have to go north then find a turn around point. The atmosphere was nice. Some old objects on walls for ambiance. Plenty of seating. No wait on Saturday. It looks deceiving on the outside, I wasn't sure they were open, but I was there around 6pm.   I'll be returning for sure. Thanks for a great first experience everyone there!",

My margarita was mostly that bottled mix stuff.  I fixed it by ordering a shot of tequila and a bunch of lime wedges, lol! He had the parrillada de rancho (spelling problems mine) and I had the shrimp fajitas. The corn tortillas were perfection, beans great. We both liked the carne asada from his plate, actually grilled, not steamed. My fajitas could have used more vegetables, cooked less, but it was very tasty all around. Too full to try desserts and we brought leftovers home. We had a groupon, but we'll be back! I need to try the albondigas soup, posole, ceviche tostadas.... Etc.",

Acting on advice from the reviews I read here, I ordered the seafood enchilada - it was pure ambrosia, loaded with juicy shrimp and fish cooked just right. John had the garlic shrimp and let me try some of it; the shrimp was succulent and the garlic flavor intense - I loved it! Caveat: I'm a very big fan of garlic and am one of those people who believe that you can never have too much garlic in a dish, so some of you might find the flavor on the aggressive side if you order it. But I know it's what I'll be ordering next time ;)   The generous and tasty house margaritas were a perfect complement to the delightful repast..",

    "text": "After a full afternoon on Saturday we chose to try a different Mexican restaurant than our norm & so glad we did, I actually think we found our new spot!! We came around 7 pm, therefore when I didn't see the parking lot bursting at the seems I was kind of skeptical at first but I'm glad that I trusted my nose because the smells that were oozing from this establishment definitely pulled us in. When you walk in you definitely have that feel of a Mexican restaurant with the big chunky wood tables & benches that actually seemed to be custom made as the booths had their name Rita's carved into each booth. I just loved the feel & vibe I was getting from the place & then our wonderful server Debbie greeted us, she was as sweet as could be, also extremely helpful in our decision making. My hubby had the traditional Tecate beer & I chose a classic margarita on the rocks that had such a kick to it that I felt it once I stood to take extra pics, lol!! We chose to start with the chicken quesadilla minus the onions, then my hubby chose the steak fajitas & I went with the bacon wrapped shrimp with Mexican rice. As we were waiting for all the deliciousness to arrive we started on the complimentary chips & salsa, the chips were light & crispy, freshly made......the salsa had a perfect consistency with just the right amount of spice! Then here came the quesadilla & OMG, next time I'll just choose that for my meal because it was beyond fresh & delicious with its homemade tortilla, the fresh veggies, moist chicken & perfect amount of cheese. We had to stop eating it or they would had to make our entrees to go because the quesadilla was actually that big!! Okay now here comes the entrees, my hubby's steak fajitas were perfectly seasoned & cooked, with the fresh made tortillas on the side. He was devouring his meal that he didn't even have room for the refried beans or the salad. Now I had my 6, yes 6 bacon wrapped shrimp that had fresh blue crab.....mind you no bread crumbs....... tucked inside this concoction that were cooked just right & tasted even better. FYI you must be a bacon fan to order this dish because this restaurant doesn't know the meaning of skimping on ingredients, loved it!! Also had the Mexican rice which was so good that I had to finish the rice since it's not that good to reheat, lol!! Yes I think we've found our new go to spot for our Mexican fix, love the ambiance, great service, perfect prices & awesome food.... what more could you ask for!!",

The next dish we got was the seafood cocktail de molcatejes (sp?) Talk about a humongoid bowl of awesomeness! (See the pic I posted). it was full of shrimp, octopus, scallops and fresh veggies ($20). I went with this mixed grill Plate, that had pork, beef and chicken with griled veggies and peppers! Thsi thing came out still sizzling on a huge platter! Talk about wow factor!

I didn't eat the salad, but the shrimp and rice were delicious. My husband got a mixed grill plate he thoroughly enjoyed.
