I've had better canned tomato sauce.  They need to find their salt shaker, cuz everything was tasteless.  Overcooked pasta.  Tinny tomato sauce.  No flavor.  And who serves a side of pasta with lasagna?  Pasta with pasta.  Really!!  Nothing Italian about this place, just commercial, low quality food with Italian names.  I agree with Jim C.   Once you've been to Andreoli's, it's hard to eat Italian anywhere else.  It's like night and day.  Sorry guys, but looks like enough people like it, so I don't feel too bad.  Best of luck.",

We will definitely be coming back! Y'all are spectacular :)",

The decor is nice and inviting, the chairs were comfortable to sit in.   The lunch salad was small and lacking, it had Romaine and one slice of tomato. I had Blue cheese, which was lacking too. BUT it was a good salad.   They hot Italian bread warmed in the oven with a nice garlic butter.   I had a chicken breast dish, cooked in a white wine, with sliced sausage and mushrooms. Pasta with marinara and steamed veggies (broccoli, green beans, snap peas, carrots)   The chicken was a little tough but could still be cut with a fork, the sausage and mushrooms were excellent, and I do not like mushrooms. I added some of the garlic butter while it was still hot for some extra pizazz. All together it was a really good dish.   The pasta was great, with a perfect marinara. Sprinkle some Parmesan cheese on top.   The veggies were cooked perfectly and had a good flavor.",

    "text": "Culinary Adventure #2 in Phx went MUCH MUCH better than #1.   This is a place my dad frequents, and kept talking about all day so I was eager to give it a shot. As we were driving up I noticed it was in a stripmall-esque area and I was like \"Daaaad...why always the strip mall places\". But as soon as we got in - definitely a different atmosphere than I expected. The front area is a decent bar and a waiting area; the TV in the corner was showing the ASU/UofA Bball game. There were about 4 tables full in there but it was after 8pm on a Wednesday so, I didn't hold that against them at all.   Everyone knew my dad and greeted our table with warm smiles. Some quips about the Cards and we ordered; my dad pretty much knew what was good so we went with that.   Bread was awesome - a nuttier bread which I am always a fan of. Get the garlic butter to spread on - mmmm. We got a 'special' meal that my dad concocted that he's evidently had there numerous times - grilled (not breaded) eggplant, and a side of penne with peppers/mushrooms in an al diavolo sauce. Very good. The sauce was especially spectacular.   The service was nice - attentive yet not intrusive. Best. After clearing our plates and bringing out dessert, they brought over some amaretto on the rocks 'to wash down our meal'. What a nice touch!  I had nothing bad to say about this place, except for I don't think people know much about it since it's tucked into a stripmall next to (I think) a dry cleaner or some other inane business. Highly recommended and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Phx!",

    "text": "This truly, truly is a hidden gem in northern Phoenix.   If you live in Phoenix or have stayed in Phoenix for longer than a day, you will realize that the city is practically overtaken by chain restaurants.   I went here on a recommendation from a Phoenix local and I have been to this location every time I start to crave Italian.   The food tastes, looks and feels homemade. Location and space wise, this place may not have the pizazz of a Tomaso's or Maggiano's, but the quality of the food to the cost of the meal by far outweighs what any Italian marble or rich mahogany wood trim could add to a great Italian meal.   Interesting to note, there isn't a single Pizza offering anywhere on the menu. Its really focused on regional, Italian food. If I were to make a menu recommendation, really consider ordering a special over the main staples of the menu.   I won't really go into any specific dishes, but I will say that the sauces do not taste like they come from a jar and are well executed.   Tip: I think there might be an unwritten rule that if you order a decent amount of courses, you will get a nice complementary round of amaretto or a dessert to share. I have seen this done to several others on different occasions and to myself more often or not.",

    "text": "Not since the likes of \"Pronto's\" and \"Il Pescatore\" has Phoenix tasted Italian food like this.  Yes, it's in a strip mall, but don't let that fool you.  This place is 100% top quality Italian!  Besides, what place in Phoenix isn't in a strip mall these days?    My wife found a review of this little gem online and said we had to check it out.  I'm so glad she did! We arrived and were promptly seated.  The wait staff was attentive, but not overly so.  We had our choice of seats which was a nice touch.  The wine list is more than adequate with many nice selections available by the glass.  The bread was nice and warm with really nice pesto/garlic butter.  Our salads arrived promptly, I had the Caesar and it was very good.  Our entree's followed shortly thereafter and this is pretty much where my mind gets foggy...  I had veal...it was heavenly, lightly breaded and oh-so tender.  It was bathed in a lemon sauce; much like you'd find in a piccata dish, but instead of capers, it had artichokes and mushrooms.  Did I mention heaven?  If artichokes or mushrooms aren't to your liking, the veal piccata that my wife had was amazing!  I'm actually a little jealous that she \"Out-Ordered\" me this time.  Her Gnocchi Pasta was a side dish of perfection.  The texture was a perfect firmness and not overcooked.  The pink sauce was again, Heavenly.  We finished our dinner with coffee and tiramisu.  It was again; Heavenly.  Are you noticing a trend?  There were also plenty of options for vegetarians.  Eggplant parmesan and spaghetti come to mind.  For fine Italian food, I'd say that Roma Garden is fairly priced.  Two salads, two entree's, one glass of wine, one iced tea, one coffee and one shared dessert later, we left for less than $70 before tip. Our last bit of Heavenly bliss occurred when the waiter brought us our bill.  He also brought us complementary drinks of amaretto on the rocks.  (I really gotta stop writing these reviews before lunch.) Bonnito Appetito!",

Not only that, I realize it's a small restaurant but they only had two highchairs and both were In use so we had to spend our whole time there over two hours passing my son around to hold him and feed him on my lap. Service took forever 10+ min for drinks 30+ min for food. Very limited menu and food was ok. Small sad portions for the price.",

It doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you step in the front door, the aromas, decor, and very friendly service will show you something different than you'd ever expect from a strip mall storefront.  There was a birthday party a few tables over and a variety of people of all ages who appeared to be having a very enjoyable evening.  The food was excellent with fresh ingredients and generous portions and the service was attentive and helpful. Reasonable prices and easy access to parking rounds out the pleasant experience.

She waited that long for chicken parm, not exactly a dish you would expect a hold up for in a place like this. The place was only about 60% full on a Saturday night at 6:30 pm. The food was out of this world. Had the Osso Bucco special and thought I had gone to heaven! Italian wedding soup was great as well. It's in a small strip mall and the decor was meh at best. Reasonably priced. It was a far drive from the north valley so we will keep looking for a good place closer to home. I have heard Salute is good and will give that a try next.",

    "text": "Quest Complete For years we've been on that quest to find an Italian Ristorante that fulfills those memories from our youth. Generous, steaming hot portions of wonderfully flavorful Italian favorites. We wanted to experience those memories and to share them with our kids (11 & 13) who have no frame of reference.  Unfortunately we've had so many False starts over so many years we've gotten quite skeptical. As mentioned in other reviews the location of Roma didn't mitigate our skepticism much, around the far corner in a strip mall that is mostly closed up gave us a long moment of pause. Upon entering our worries were calmed. Nicely appointed, comfortable and inviting, we were relieved.   The menu is familiar yet there are plenty of options you may not expect. Veal is my favorite dish but I've been disappointed for over 20 years so I resisted. We decided to stay with some classic's. Caesar Salad for an appetizer, Spaghetti & Meatballs, Lasagna Bolognese, Mostaccioli and Chicken Cacciatore. The busser brought a huge portion of hot, toasted bread with herbed butter to get started.  The herbed butter was a pleasant surprise as we've found that most chef's overdo it on the herbs. The Caesar was pleasant, tangy and we accepted the offered extra parmesan & ground pepper. The food come out as we were all taking our last bites - perfect!  All four dishes were fantastic. Healthy, steaming hot portions of perfectly cooked pasta, hallelujah!!!! Someone who understands that \"al dente\" doesn't mean chewy, it means firm. Plenty of gooey melted cheese, wonderful sauces, hearty meatballs, flavors that complemented each dish perfectly. We gorged ourselves, happy to share with each other the reality that each one of us chose something we really enjoyed, what flavors, what fun!  The service was nice, not overbearing, overly formal, rushed or slow. The table was well maintained, refills came at the appropriate times, small talk and smiles were honest and easy. A perfect compliment to the meal.  We had no room for dessert but we still got the Outrageous Chocolate Cake - gone in 1 minute. We were stuffed, but had (4) boxes heavy with left overs to take and enjoy at home. The final treat was the complimentary Amaretto aperitifs to cap off the finest Italian meal we've had in over 20 years.  To top off the entire experience we got to chat with the owners just before leaving. It really doesn't get any better. (Veal next visit for sure.)  P.S.  Well, I guess it does get better - after a 2 hour ride back to Flagstaff our son decided that he enjoyed his meal so much he couldn't wait until the next day so he heated up his left overs before going to bed. (I think he just wanted to make sure I didn't get to them before he could ;-)",

A little hidden gem. The decor made me feel like I was somewhere else- I felt like I should have dressed nicer! It's very classy inside and the chairs are so comfy which is always a plus.        The bread was so good, we ended up asking for more twice! My friend got the cheese ravioli which was awesome, and my dad got the chicken piccata- yumm. I got the tortellini with mushrooms in alfredo sauce and it was so good. Creamy and rich and just what I want when I think Italian food. My parents appreciated the complimentary amaretto at the end!   I will definitely come back here if I'm in the area again. It was all an Italian restaurant should be!",

My companion and I enjoyed our meals immensely.  We ordered an antipasto (split, off the menu) and pasta e fagiole. My companion ordered one of the daily specials, Princess Chicken. I had the Eggplant Parmagiana. We split an order of tiramisu for dessert. Our meals came with hot bread and a garlic-infused butter spread.  The antipasto consisted of thinly sliced capaccolo, prosciutto, and a hard northern cheese. The pasta was al dente. The vegetables were cooked without being mushy. The pasta e fagiole had spaghetti instead of ditalini, but was otherwise great. The portions were more than ample. The tiramisu? Is there such a thing as \"bad\" tiramisu??  Our waiter was knowledgeable and the service was excellent,  Everything we ordered reminded me of home (New York City). This restaurant would not be out of place in NYC, Boston's North End or Providence's Federal Hill.",

My grandma introduced me to Roma Garden long ago with their delicious herb butter and warm crusty bread with a glass of house chianti. I overlooked their oddly shaped rolling chairs and focused on the excellent waitstaff and delicious Chef Mastacciolo or Chef Raviolis or the Pollo Parmasiana or the Fettucini Alfredo or the...  Oh crap, I told you this would happen. I'm so hungry!  So, it's not the most up-to-date restaurant in town, but it's so cozy and the food is fantastic. They have happy hours with $1 off beer and well, $2 off their vast selection of house wines, and $3 off appetizers in the bar from 4-6pm daily. Reverse happy hour from 8pm-close and all day on Monday & Wednesday. But what I suggest, if you're looking to save some cash and are dying to try this place, is to go eat Monday to Thursday from 4-5:30pm. Smaller dinners for half price! Their normal portions are ginormous anyway, so it's really the perfect size. Your stomach and wallet will thank you.",

When you walk through the doors, you will always receive a warm greeting. And, you'll be transported into a nice restaurant, and forget the restaurant is located in a nondescript strip mall.   The staff is always professional and attentive, making sure drinks are refreshed and that the meal meets expectations, yet allowing you to enjoy the experience.  This visit we started out with an order of crab cakes. They were good, but would've been better without the sauce. And they were large - could be a meal in themselves.  Entrees come with a salad; I do wish they'd do something to make this more interesting that a few green leaves and pale tomatoes. It really doesn't leave the diner waiting in anticipation for the course to come - it is very boring.  The veal dishes we've enjoyed here have all been very good and would highly recommend. The veal is tender and well prepared. The halibut special was good - fish cooked perfectly and very flavorful. Served on a bed of pasta, so the presentation wasn't particularly attractive. The Salmon Piemontese was also very good.   And an Italian meal must end with a dish of spumoni - yum!",

We did get some bread eventually...once our server deigned to drop by the table.  His lack of engagement has been forewarned in repeated Yelps, but we were willing to overlook it for good Italian...however...  We started with Roma Garden house salad with the house dressing.  Crisp lettuce, a few crescents of red onion, two wedges of decent tomato and a sprinkling of canned, sliced black olives, all coated with a disgustingly sweet homemade dressing.  I only ate a little of my 6.95 salad...DH,  however, liked the dressing, comparing it to poppy seed without the poppy seeds.  For dinner DH ordered chicken parmesan and I ordered the veal piedmontese.  Both were advertised as served with pasta.  DH'S oval platter had a glob of rigatoni to one side, a pile of sloppy foodservice frozen veggies to the other, and in the middle, a bounty of tomato sauce concealing a chicken cutlet.  DH said the quality of the chicken was good, but the breading was slimy and sauce acidic and unbalanced.  He thought his entree had been microwaved, the heat was so intense.  He was not pleased.  My veal came with a white wine-lemon-butter sauce with canned mushrooms and artichokes which was quite good, and the veal was tender, but flaccid and unseasoned.  It also came with the unappealing rigatoni and frozen veggies.  How much preferable to have some plain pasta, like angel hair or linguini to sop up unexpectedly tasty sauce.    DH ate about three bites of his chicken parm.  I finished the veal and what sauce I could scoop up.  It's a very pretty restaurant with cloth tablecloths and napkins and sparkling glassware.  But mediocre food and service takes it off our list for a return visit.  Too bad.",

Roma Garden wasn't far from where we were staying, and it reviewed well, so we gave it a shot. We were so glad we did!  We came in about an hour before closing and sat at the bar area to get some drinks and order food to go. They had a good selection of wines and I settled on a really great Riesling. The bartender was charming and gave great recommendations for what to order. For food, we ordered one of their specials (a pork chop served with your choice of pasta and mixed veggies), the lasagna, and the chicken Marsala (also served with vegges and your choice of pasta). We were concerned the pork might be dry, given how easy it is to overcook it, but it was so moist and tender. The lasagna was fantastic, as was the chicken Marsala. Our only complaints were that the fettuccine we ordered with the pork was a bit dense and bland, and the sauce on the pasta served with the chicken Marsala was a little too acidic for my taste. That said, we really enjoyed our meals and will probably be back next time we're in the area!  Bonus: check in on Yelp! and get 10% off your order!",

We'd never heard of it, but we're always up for trying something new, especially with $50 towards our meal.  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!  When you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!  We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.  ****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that, but I was impressed by this!  In speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 15 years.  Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley... we'll be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine \"Northern Italian Cuisine\" without a doubt.  I suggest you go check it out also - bon appetito!",

One of my favorite dishes is the lasagne. It has generous portions of meat in it, and loads of cheese.   Bottom line if you want good Italian, at a mom and pop place here you go.",

    "text": "One of the finest restaurants we ate at in Phoenix.  Roma Garden is located in a strip mall on the far, far, far northeast side of Phoenix. Don't be put off by its exterior, though--there's good food in here.  My wife had the spaghetti and meatballs, and the picky eater that she is, it's a high compliment for her to say that these were the best spaghetti and meatballs she's ever had. They were huge (2\" or more!) and tender... hooray for panades! The sauce was flavorful but thin and not chunky.  I had the veal with mushrooms and artichoke. This was good and fresh; I wasn't sure what exactly would come back, but this veal reminded me more of a thin slice of pork than anything else. Even though it wasn't what I expected, it ended up very good.  We had calamari for an appetizer. It was very crunchy and the marinara sauce, like the spaghetti sauce, was wonderfully fresh and coated the calamari well.  Service was exceptional! The staff was on top of the meal and our drinks, and they were very helpful. Roma Garden was the best way for us to end our time in the southwest.",

They have a very delicious menu and the people that work there are so friendly and professional. Needless to say We've been there twice since Valentines Day that's how much we liked it.",

    "text": "So this is the place we ended up going after all of my research for where to go for the B day dinner, my dad decided that we should have one dinner for my brother and I, and then the place we chose was not to his liking so my dad ended up picking this place. So I was kind of down on the place from the beginning. Anyway, we had a group of 11 people and for a good amount of time we were the only people in the restaurant. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer and they also brought out their bread. I think the bread was the best part of the whole restaurant, the garlic butter was really good. The calamari was good too, it had kind of a spicy sauce, so I liked that.   I ended up ordering the chicken princess, which is chicken in a wine sauce with asparagus on top. The waiter said 'Chicken princess for the princess.' Really? Really? It's not like I'm 10 years old. Who says that? I found that really weird. And then when he brought it out he said it again... I found it very strange. Other than that the service was fine. But come on.   So on to the food. My chicken was really good, but the sides that came with it were not good. It came with gnocchi in alfredo and with some veggies. The alfredo was a bit strange, and I don't think it complimented the chicken, they should have used a different sauce because the two white sauces kind of clashed. Also, the veggies had way too much lemon squeezed on them. They just tasted like lemon.... not so good. I tried what my dad ordered (lamb shank) and I was not a fan, but he seemed to like it. I heard the eggplant was just ok, and that the clam sauce was good. I also tried some of their Caesar salad and that was pretty good, the croutons had a nice flavor.   Anyway, I don't know if I would come back here, especially given that I live so far away from the restaurant; However, if you live around the corner it's a decent place to try.",

The service is excellent - very attentive to our needs.  This last time I dined at Roma Garden was on my birthday, and the chef brought out a complimentary dessert and Amaretto on the rocks.  This was a nice touch to an already top-notch meal.  There are a few other restaurants that call themselves Italian but aren't by any stretch.  One particular chain that has \"garden\" in its name comes to mind as a place that is about as non-authentic Italian as you can get.  Stay clear of those places and stick to locally-owned eateries like Roma Garden.",

You could miss this if you're not looking carefully, (hint:  it faces 40th street)  as it is just a strip mall storefront, but inside it is much better than expected.  Just the decor itself will wow you.  We went in without reservations and it happened to be prom night, but we were seated ASAP in the front section which was just lovely.  Our server, Jen, and her assistant, \"El Magnifico\" were so friendly, super attentive, even though they could have been all stressed about the big groups of prom kids in the main section.  No sweat, just another night for them.  Just loved the service.  Be sure to check in on Yelp and show them the 10% off coupon.  Free amaretto at end of meal.    I guess I should talk about the food.  It was our first visit so we played it safe, but the basics were good enough to plan for a return.  My spaghetti/marinara/sausage  (which was recommended by Jen when I told her I just needed to try the red sauce on my first visit)  was perfectly fine.  Hubby had stuffed peppers and we both loved them.    We like going to local places that are a bit more \"fancy,\" and after being completely disgusted by Belfiore, we were extremely relieved to have our faith restored in nice Italian restaurants by visiting Roma Garden. Spinato's is closer to us but this place is more fitting for \"date night.\"  The place just simply made us happy;  please go here and support them!",

If we wanted Italian, we'd go with the familiar restaurants like Olive Garden or something else well known.  The Roma Garden is literally a hidden gem.  If you happened to spot it from one of the main roads in Phoenix, you wouldn't even take a second look since it's in a plaza where every other unit is out of business.  Thanks to Yelp, we discovered this gem and found it to be the best Italian cuisine we've ever had.  Plus, the owner and waitress were very friendly and spent a lot of time getting to know us and also sharing other hidden gems within the city.  We would definitely go again.  Make sure you tell them you found them on Yelp.",

We asked to sit at the many empty tables for four. Were told no as they all had reservations. The waiter must have noticed the perplexed expression on my face because he came back after we sat and told us that a reservation had cancelled and offered us one of those tables...So points for that...Side note, all those tables were empty for the entire time we were there.  I ordered the Chicken with prosciutto...I promise you that what I got was chicken with some sort of thick slab of very salty pork product that was not prosciutto, accompanied by the limpest over done pasta I've ever had..The noodles broke in the fork because they were so water logged and soggy. Also served with a basic marinara sauce that in no way complimented the lemon wine sauce on the chicken. My husband ordered the special..seafood risotto. Plenty of seafood, but we're still trying to decide if it was really risotto or some undercooked rice..There was none of the creaminess associated with well prepared risotto.  After that we decided to go for broke and order the tiramisu..You can get better at your basic supermarket bakery.  The service was very good as the waiter and busser were very attentive..",

Nearly every time the food has been well prepared and delicious, plus the service was always attentive.  My only issue with it was I considered to be a rather pricy restaurant.  The last two times we have been there have been rather disappointing.  I don't know if there is a new chef / owner or what, but the food is not as good as before and our dishes very greasy.  The prices are still as high as before.  The service we had the other night was abominable.   The server, Jenn, was one of the worst servers we have experienced in a long time.  There were two occupied tables when we arrived (and two other servers) and we had to wait for over ten minutes to be acknowledged and for our drink order to be taken.  The specials she told us were not the same as another server was telling his table.  The meal went downhill after that.  We had to ask and re-ask for just about everything.  The one bright spot was the bus girl who was so attentive.  Jenn kept telling us how busy she was (at her busiest she had three tables) yet she had plenty of time to talk at length to a table about what was happening on the TV show \"Big Brother\".  It even took forever to get the check, which was finally handled by another server.  All in all, it was a disappointing, expensive meal that was ruined even further by a terrible server.",

The second time we sat in the dining room on Sunday night and had a good experience.  The food was phenomenal both times!  Chicken parm, eggplant parm, spaghetti and meatballs, mozzarella appetizer and sausage mostaccioli (not sure if that's spelled correctly).  The second time the service was hit or miss.  Everyone was very polite but took a while to clean the table, fill waters, provide the check, etc.  Did I mention the place was empty on the second visit?  So no real excuse for not providing top notch service.  So that's the reason for 4 stars combined with the fact that they charge $7.95 for a piece of cheesecake that was just okay.  The bonus is the complimentary amaretto at the end of your dinner.  We'll be back... we'll just sit in the bar and skip dessert.",

However, recently they lost one of their chefs.  My husband, a friend and I went in on A Friday night.  We got there reasonably early, before the dinner rush was on.  We had the crab cakes and the stuffed clams.  They were absolutely wonderful. Then we waited.  Our salad showed up.  Then we waited.  And waited.  And waited. Finally, we asked our waiter about the length of time spent waiting.  He informed us about the loss of a chef.  Finally, our meal came out.  My husband and I had the Chicken Oscar.  Our friend had the special of the night--Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli.  We were not pleased with out meal.  Our friend said his ravioli became cold quickly.  Our chicken was dry and had a small slice of crab.  When we informed the waiter he did offer us a complimentary dessert.  Still....  We were disappointed given that this restaurant had been amazing every time we have been there.    Their stuffed peppers are wonderful.  The Lamb shank is incredible.  The Chicken Princess or Piccata are equally good.  Unfortunately, this was less than their best.  The sad thing is that we have gone back to eat and also ordered take out; each time the food is less than par. Even our friend, who is in there weekly, said he won't be back for a few months.   Perhaps the bar was too high for too long?  Perhaps the better chef left?   What ever it is, I hope they get it back soon.  It is an elegant little restaurant that was magical when at the top of their game.",

Space- nice enough but bit too bright and the music is so low that you hear everyone's conversation- little odd. Bathrooms- paper towel machine in ladies room not working- so told the waitress hopefully this will be fixed.  Wine- they had decent Rose so we ordered a bottle and also had Brunello di Montalcino- which is a big plus.  Food- the Caprese salad was very good and fresh. Break was good as well. Eggplant Parmesan was very good but sauce little thin and acidic. The chicken Marsala had fantastic sauce, however, the chicken was dry and stingy so they replaced that for us.  Service- definitely better than most restaurants so that made up for overall experience.   Seems like nice place to go for your neighborhood Italian.",

    "text": "I do not like writing negative reviews. Nor do I like reading reviews from Yelpers that antagonize owners and managers into giving out coupons and free meals in order to erase a poor review. Therefore, I will not have any repugnant or unfavorable language, as this establishment does not warrant it. Roma Garden is one of those places you could drive by one hundred times and not notice it. My girlfriend and I arrived at 6pm to a mostly empty dining room. A couple of golden aged regulars were sitting at the bar and another elderly couple were just getting their drink order taken. Apparently we had just missed the Early Bird specials... these should have been clues as to how the rest of our evening was going to turn out. The waiter gave us a loaf of bread with their delicious herb butter. Next, we ordered the escargot, as we often do when it's on the menu. They were good. Even better with parmesan cheese!  Our waiter took our orders after the appetizer arrived. I know that is protocol at some restaurants, but that one move turned a 45min dining experience into an hour and a half. We finished our snails pretty quickly. We were hungry. It took about a half hour until our entrees were served. Luckily, my girlfriend and I weren't pressed for time. Averaging about $20 per plate, our dinners were kind of the same, even though we ordered 2 vastly different meals. She had the eggplant parmesan while I had the pollo piemontese. I guess every dish comes with noodles and marinara along with what seem to be a pre-mixed frozen vegetable medley. In the spirit of positive thinking, our dinners were just ok-- nothing exceptional, yet nothing disappointing.  We saved room for dessert. I, for one, am glad we did. Their cheesecake was wonderful! Overall, I would like to say that this restaurant is aimed specifically at the older generation. It's a great place to take your grandparents if they are visiting. The atmosphere is quiet, yet welcoming. The food can take awhile, which is perfect for dinners revolved around the conversation rather than the food itself. And everyone seemed to enjoy their job.",

    "text": "I have been on Yelp for over a year and am always the person to read everyone else's reviews, but never leave my own.  Well, Roma Garden has changed that!!  I want THE WHOLE WORLD to know how amazing their food, service and restaurant is.  My husband and I went there to celebrate date night as well as my 30th birthday.  We were lucky enough to have Jenn as our waitress and she was AMAZING!!  Never once did we feel rushed or pressured and she was always there to explain our options and answer all of our questions .   We took our time and just enjoyed the surroundings.  We started our meal with the stuffed clams which were delicious.  And the Marsala wine sauce on top was like a heavenly gravy.  The complimentary bread and herb butter was the perfect accompaniment to my moscato.  Pedro (the magnifico) was always there to fill our waters, bring more bread and was so helpful without us having to ask for a single thing.    Now on to our meals....I ordered the seafood pasta (which wasn't even on the menu but they made it for me!).  It was a full lobster tail, calamari, mussels, clams, prawns (giant) over a bed of fettuccine and pink/vodka sauce!!! It was heavenly!!!    My husband ordered one of the evening's specials...the seafood risotto which had all of the same seafood as my pasta but it was over a bed of risotto with a homemade marinara sauce!  Needless to say....it was the best meal we have ever had!!  Not only was the food amazing, but the service was the best we have ever had.    And to top it all off, the prices were more than reasonable.  We have been to five start restaurants, and this food was hands down ten times better.  We will be coming back here for EVERY date night and will bring as many people as possible with us!!  Thank you Roma Garden, Jenn and Pedro (the magnifico) for making my 30th birthday over the top special!!",

They are engaging, funny and make going out to dinner fun. The food here has always been solid with the exception of a undercooked fish once. If you want non Italian there are better choices in the general area but they are on par with all of the other quality Italian restaurants. Closest option would be Nicks on Tatum and Shea.

Small little place, but when you're inside you kind of forget it's in a strip mall... white linen tablecloths, formal place settings, candles....       The bread came out hot and along side it was some garlic herb butter which was very yummy but a bit too garlicky for my husband.  Hard for anything to be too garlicky for me!  I got the chicken parmigiana which was fantastic.  The red sauce was excellent and that's what makes a good Italian restaurant.  Very basic but flavorful.  My husband ordered the veal cordon bleu special which was amazing.  The main dish was SO good, but the veggies that came with it were also delicious.  We don't even like brussel sprouts which were part of the medley, but devoured these ones.  Not sure how they cooked them.  I thought it was kind of pricey when ordering, but after eating it, I felt it was worth it.  Even though this place is in no way conveniently located to us, we'll be back!",

By far my favorite here is the spaghetti with white claim sauce.  Love that they serve bread before and during your meal at no additional charge.  looking forward to my next visit",

    "text": "Another gem in our backyard. You will be shocked when you step inside Roma Garden to find yourself in an adorable white-linen restaurant that feels like a neighborhood spot.   The food was delicious -- our only complaint was the service. We were the only ones in the restaurant at the time (weekday evening), and our glasses constantly were empty. Once we were finishing our meal, we heard what we were sure was mariachi music blaring from the kitchen. The restaurant was about 45 minutes from closing, so I'm sure the kitchen staff was just counting down the minutes until the end of their shift, but this felt like poor form. We will still come back though, and I'd be happy to update the review after a better experience.",

But I have got to be honest the food is just terrible. This is the first time a highly rated yelp facility has let me down.  We came for the ossa buco(sp), but although pictured in website it is only offered as a special.  I ordered chicken cacciatore and Liz ordered the chicken piccata.  What we got was two thin strips of packaged chicken with heavy marinara sauce on mine and a lemon butter sauce on hers. This was nowhere near the classic half chicken prepared in the same wine as the surrounding sauce.  Both dishes were accompanied with rigatoni that tasted heavy and dated.  It's too bad, nice place, nice people but bad food. They did not charge me for my dish but this was little compensation for a ruined evening.  Think maybe loyal regulars inflated rating.",

Unfortunately, we came to the conclusion that people who gave this place great reviews don't know how to cook Italian at home.  We tried both the vegetable soup and their tortellini/chicken broth soup.  Both were lame and were returned.  I can cook better at home.  My girl was burping up the soup later that night, even she only tried a few sips.  She said good thing she didn't try to eat the whole thing.  The Roma Garden salad was very good.  Tasty.  I also ordered the Veal Piemontese.  Mediocre dish with mediocre taste.  I can do better at home.  As for service, it seems the other tables had servers that were attentive and friendly.  Our server was rarely available or around.  The ambiance and atmosphere is nice.",

He got seafood pasta and I got rack of lamb. The portions are very generous and they even omitted he shrimp on or request AND offered to double up on another seafood option (we chose scallops). Both meals were fantastic. The pink sauce on the pasta was great. The wine list has a good variety and the chianti was quite nice. Very mellow yet full bodied. The wine portion was generous. And to top it off we were offered a complimentary amaretto at the end.   I won't lie - it was a little pricey ($29 per plate) but the ambiance, quality of food, and friendliness of the staff made it worthwhile.",

But if you brave the folks looking for their next fix of orange chicken you will find a place that meets every one of my (high) expectations.  The food is fresh, full of flavor and cooked perfectly (and I should know I cooked at gourmet restaurants for years).  They do have an extensive menu, but the gems are usually the specials.  Their specials are whatever they found that is the freshest and yummiest. And if you want it prepared in a specific way, no problem--it will be perfect.  I have never had a bad meal.  The service is friendly, they remember your name and  preferences such as your flavor of vodka and that you don't like one dish served on the same plate as another.

    "text": "After celebrating New Year's Eve at this establishment last year and having a wonderful dining experience, we decided to return with a couple of friends this past New Year's Eve. We had an 8:00p reservation for four on New Year's Eve (2012) and the restaurant was very busy when we were arrived.    We were seated fairly fast; however, it appears that all of the reservations were scheduled for the same time as they refrained from taking our drink orders until everyone in the restaurant had been seated. Soon after we were seated, we realized that there were only what appeared to be 3 waiters on hand to service the entire restaurant. This resulted in a ~20+ minute wait (after being seated) for our drinks.   Furthermore, it appeared that there was no manager on hand as on multiple occasions we tried in vain to gain the attention of someone, anyone, for an update as to the whereabouts of our food.  To make a long story short, although we arrived at the restaurant a bit before 8:00p, but were not served our actual dinners until 9:46p.  Although the food was great, the service was seriously lacking.  To make matters worse, when I went to the restroom there was apparently a bit of an altercation between one of the waiters and a diner from a table of 12 or so, which was seated next to us.  My husband informed me that one of the diners had asked one of the waiters what was taking so long and the waiter proceeded to tell the patron that he \"should leave if he didn't want to wait.\"  In my opinion, this was extremely rude given that the majority of the people there hadn't yet eaten after waiting at least an hour and a half.  Simply stated, it's likely that we will be back because the food itself was good; however, we definitely will not be recommending this restaurant to friends again, at least not until we've made sure that the wait staff has improved.",

Can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu!",

The place is very cozy...not over done in Italian motif and very unpretentious.  We were seated quickly and after being served water we treated to a review of some delicious sounding specials.  We chatted  a bit about it and decided on the Veal Osso Bucco and Scallops, both in a wine sauce,  with pasta and vegetables.  Before our meals came, we were treated to some awesome piping hot bread!  We would have had more, but wanted to save room for dinner.....we would go there just for the bread!  Our waiter was very attentive and it didn't take long for our food to arrive.   Fabulous choices!  Both the veal and the fish were super tender and left us wanting more...even though we were stuffed.  The scallops were pretty big and they threw in a few jumbo shrimp on top for good measure.....also perfectly cooked.  The pasta was also prepared just right and the vegetables were the best we have ever been served.  Our order was not cheap, however we are interested in coming back to try some of the regular items on the menu.  The meal was topped of with a complimentary shot of chilled ammaretto....delish!",

It's clearly a place with a solid base of regulars, as evidenced by the gregarious interaction between the staff and patrons.  Two of the people in our party had not been to the new location since they moved from Bell Rd., and so were hoping it was still as good as it used to be, and it did not disappoint!   My father ordered veal (can't remember honestly if it was parm or marsala), and said it was some of the best he had ever tasted.  Three of us ordered the Pollo Piemontese and LOVED it.  Reasonably priced, beautifully presented, and the staff is top-notch.  We were so full from dinner that we declined dessert, and as a treat the owner sent over an after-dinner aperitif on the house.  You don't get treated like that every day, now do you?  I'll be back next time i'm in Phoenix, you can count on that.",

Last Sunday, we tried an Italian restaurant in south Scottsdale that's been on my BM'd \"To do List\" forever and we left disappointed wanting more. Last night we tried another one from my list and left thinking, why haven't we been here before now? D'oh!  Both places were upscale, white tablecloth Italian. Yet Roma Garden Ristorante was the more complete dinning experience and delivered the goods. They even offered us a complementary night cap of Amaretto di Saronno, when we hesitated on ordering dessert. Wow. Classy!  We arrived at 5 pm but didn't have reservations.  Somehow they found a table for us in the back. All very pleasant and polite. Nice. Btw, from what we could tell, there isn't a bad seat in the house (photo). And yes, we were all the way in the back. LOL  We started off with two glasses of red wine, a Merlot and a Chianti. Both were generous pours. Next up was a House Salad and then our entrees. My wife ordered the Lasagna Bolognese($16.45) and I had the special of Halibut Picatta ($29.95) which had an amazing white wine, lemon-butter reduction sauce, with capers (photos). Wow!  Both were very good, but the fish was perfect!  Besides the Amarettos for dessert, we tried their four mini Cannolis for $7.95(photo), which was also a hit. The tab for two came to $73.15 and that was before a Yelp discount of $10 - that we only discovered after Checking-In. Thank you Papa Bear J!  That was a nice surprise.   So needless to say, we'll be back. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I returned to Roma Garden and ordered my go-to dish, Pasta Romantica with shrimp, marinara sauce with a touch of cognac.  Hubby had one of his favorites which they customized for him here for the first time:  Eggplant, chicken stacked with marinara sauce all over, no cheese.   They were nice about customizing  and did a decent job.  Their marinara sauce is very good; not sweet (SW style) and not vinegary so anything they put it on should taste good.   My Pasta Romantica that I so looked forward to: MEH.  Why write on the menu that it has COGNAC when there was no cognac in it?  That's one of the reasons I order it==that cognac flavoring does a body good! But it was missing.  They gave me 7 shrimp two of which were super large Chernobyl style but the rest were smaller so they were slightly overcooked.  Before ordering I had said, make sure you don't overcook the shrimp... it happens so often in restaurants. You end up with hockey pucks.  It was not so extreme here.  The two large shrimp were delicious and perfectly cooked.  I ate these two shrimp, a little pasta and packed the rest to go hoping that someone in my house would eat it as the dish is not cheap--$24 if I recall correctly.   Our server was very nice, in general.  I didn't appreciate him telling me to put away my phone when the food came!  Very nervy.  Besides I was doing a check-in on Yelp!  He redeemed himself when he opened the front door for us when we exited.  But management has to tell him that telling a customer to put away their phone is not appropriate.   The 3 stars are for my hubby's dish which was done as requested.   Now that my go-to dish at Roma is a bust, why do I need to go back?",

Our server Steve was very professional and attentive, catering to our every need such as going out of his way to bring different types of sauces, making suggestions and also making sure our drinks were filled at the proper time.   We ordered the calamari for an appetizer which was really good. My husband ordered the chicken marsala and I ordered the chicken piccata and a specialty garden salad to share along with their house wine.  The salad was amazing with crisp lettuce and fresh artichokes, black olives, onions etc The chicken Piccata was good but I was not totally satisfied because the sauce was very little and I like It to be more lemony. My husband was okay with his entree but commented that his marsala sauce was not reduced enough.   We had cannoli for Desert which was absolutely amazing. The best we've ever had! Their cappuccino coffee was also excellent! The house wine was smooth and as I mentioned before, Steve was very attentive and came to our table often to make sure we were taken care of.  I would have given this restaurant a 5, were it not that my husband and I were not totally satisfied with our main entree and the location of the restaurant is in a shopping center.",

We both liked mine a little more, I think the zingarella had a little less flavor than the saltimbocca. Maybe more sauce would have made it better. The service was interesting; our server had been there for 16 years so he was able to give us the history of the restaurant. Overall it was a cute little hole in the wall; maybe just update the decor a bit and they are good to go.",

I loved my meal. I got the chicken Parm and my husband got the veal Parm. We got a full carafe of the house Chianti as well :)  The bread came out shortly after we were seated accompanied by a garlic herb butter. Deliciousness... The bread was warm and fluffy with enough chewiness on the inside and crispness on the outside. I could've eaten a whole loaf but made myself stop.  Honestly, my chicken Parm was one of the best I've had. Very moist and very flavorful. I was very happy and couldn't even finish the meal! I got the rest to go for the next day. Husband liked his veal Parm but was much more impressed with my chicken Parm.   The wine was good. The service was good. The overall feel of the restaurant was that of a neighborhood establishment where you are treated like family.   The complimentary amaretto desert drink was very much appreciated as well! We will be back!!!",

We originally ordered glasses of the house Chianti and he recommended the carafe as a better deal so I know it was his mistake. Very disappointed.

    "text": "The Italian restaurant that we have been looking for.  My 600th Yelp review, at long last, goes to Roma Garden, and this place is worthy of such a lofty number.  A good Italian restaurant is surprisingly hard to find in the Valley.  I have visited many here only to be moderately satisfied, disappointed, or even angered.  At the first bite of pasta here, I knew that I had a winner--by far this is the finest Italian joint that I know of right now in the Phoenix area.    What makes it the best?  Authenticity.  I grew up with Italian food, ate it all my life, and have cooked it for friends and family.  Does this taste like mine?  No, but it has that quality, that body, that. . .taste that only real Italian has.  Their sauce is thick, slow-cooked, and with a perfect balance of spices and tomato.  Yes.  There is no better comfort food than a bowl of rigatoni generously ladled with meat sauce.  This place can serve you up a BIG serving of just that.  Add to it a bowl of tortellini soup, and NOW you've got a meal that's worth driving some miles for.    See all those other four and five star reviews?  Here's one more.  Woohoo indeed.",

My husband will tell you his Italian mother is a better cook but he enjoyed his lasagna and ate every bite of it.   The restaurant is small but cute with white table clothes and friendly service. We were seated right away with no reservation. They are quick to bring out a basket of warm breads and a delicious herb butter and your water glass is always kept full. I was disappointed there was no kids menu as the prices are high for a kid to eat a full portion but at least I know he has lunch and dinner for tomorrow still out of his spaghetti and meatballs. I had the chicken piccata which was very good. The chicken was moist and flavorful and came with a side of veggies and penne pasta. We will certainly give them another try so we can sample something different from the menu. Next time we will be smart enough to go without the kid.  Dinner for three with no drinks, just entrees, was approximately $54.00 before tip.",

    "text": "If you are looking for outstanding food in a quiet, intimate setting, Roma Garden Ristorante is the perfect place for you. We read several of the reviews before going to Roma Garden. For those reviewers who complained about the atmosphere, we found those criticisms to be unfounded. We spent the afternoon in downtown Scottsdale, having lunch at one of the trendy restaurants. This place, and several others that we scoped out, made sure that their spaces were decorated with the latest styles and newest furniture. Roma Garden stays True to its roots. It is tastefully decorated; it feels like more of an extension of someone's home than a restaurant. Several of the still-life paintings on the wall were created for the restaurant. With a small bar and only about 10 tables, the setting is romantic and allows for quiet conversations with members of your party. The service was outstanding. Our services were personable and knowledgeable. We had a nice conversation with two of the servers, again, making the place feel more like someone's home than a restaurant. When we sat down, the table next to us had just received their meals. The smell of their food was intoxicating. We started with the stuffed mushroom appetizer which was unique and delightful. One of the reviewers mentioned the bread. We concur; the bread and herbed butter are a wonderful addition to the meal. The most challenging part of our meal was deciding what to eat. One can choose from an amazing array of classic Northern dishes. Our two choices, Pollo Saltimbucco and Pollo Piccante, did not disappoint. The side of pasta has a sweet and savory marinara sauce (making me wish that I had ordered either the lasagna or a pasta dish...maybe next time), and the side of vegetables was a nice balance to the main dish. Both portions were generous and incredibly tasty. They were each sauced well. It was clear that a great deal of care and experise were parts of the preparation. If we lived here, I imagine that Roma Garden would be a weekly destination for us. We love to go to places where the food is made with love and the staff loves what they are doing. Roma Garden fits the bill.",

Most recently I had an appetizer of crab cakes, which were delicious, and a chef-special scallop dish. Everything was incredibly flavorful and cooked perfectly.

I had just heard about Roma Garden and it was in my friend's  neighborhood so we went.  The restaurant faces East in the strip mall on the South West corner of 40th St. and Thunderbird.  Next to Panda Express.  It is not a big place.  We were the only guests there for an early dinner.  Candlelight and fresh roses at the table and I still didn't feel cozy.  My knife had something on it.  I ended up not using it.  We were the first guests of the evening and it seemed like our waiter hadn't adjusted to the fact that he was at work.  Kind of sluggish.  Not impressed so far.  The bread saved the day.  It was hot and fresh and was accompanied by an herb butter.  My main dish was the Chicken Saltimbocca.  The ingredients were fresh and the side of pasta and marinara were good.  My guest won in my book.  He had ravioli with lobster and crab topped with pink sauce.  He got his rich and creamy.  I had a sample.  Wow!!!  For dessert I had the tiramisu.  It was presented well and tasted okay.  My friend had the chocolate mousse cake and he said it reminded him of Jello pudding.  This one did not stand out.  It was presented well though.  I would come back for the bread and would try something else on the menu.  Roma Garden was A-OK.",

Over the years things got better and now we have one or two places we feel offer the good Italian food in Arizona.  Some friends asked us to join them for dinner Roma Gardens and what a fantastic experience it was. I usually find one or two things that are just OK. But here, EVERYTHING from the bread and butter to dessert was EXCELLENT. Service was just right, food preparations and temperatures were as they should be. The owner thanked us on our way out.

    "text": "This is my family's all time favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  We celebrate all of our milestones here - both good and bad.  The restaurant is family owned - and the family is delightful! They make you feel welcome from the onset of your visit.  The staff that is not family 'by blood' might was well be family - it's that jovial an atmosphere.  My husband is hard of hearing, and has problems in most restaurants.  No matter how busy they are, they allow us to sit in a quiet corner of the lounge and eat our supper, so we can actually talk.    However Roma Garden is more than just a friendly place.  The food is fabulous!  One can order from the menu, from specials, or, if they have the ingredients, one can have something special concocted.  This is my go-to place when I have picky eater friends and family in town - everyone gets what they want - and everyone is happy with the food!  My husband hates zucchini and they always remember to fix his veggies sans zucchini.  The ingredients are always fresh; the meat is first rate, as is the fish.  They cook vegetables to perfection.  Their rice is fluffy and flavorable.  Their sauces are subtle and tasty.  Food comes to the table freshly prepared and hot, followed by either the owner of the staff with fresh pepper and fresh parm if one wants to embellish a bit more.  I love their veal chops, and their pasta dishes, but quite honestly I  have yet to taste a dish here that I didn't like.  My husband adores their salads.  I don't eat salads, but I can say that their desserts are delightful.  The Tiramisu is light and creamy and not oversweet like at chain restaurants.  With a cup of their excellent coffee or a glass of amaretto, it's a great way to finish the meal.  I can't gush enough about this place, or the folks that run the restaurant!",

    "text": "...And now I know what Italian food is supposed to taste like.  If there's one thing I hate, it's when I can make any style of food better than a restaurant that supposedly specializes in it. A Filipino kid born in Texas should NOT be able to make better Italian food than venues that claim mastery over the cuisine, and yet more often than not -- at least here in Arizona -- that has been the case. Even at good restaurants, my food was at least comparable in quality. Not the case here -- not even close. Roma Garden laughs at my cooking. Roma Garden's power level is over 9000. All my base are belong to Roma Garden.   After reading the glowing reviews from both Hilary K. and Gabi M., I rallied to get my family to eat here in celebration of my sister's graduation. Inconspicuously nestled in a strip mall where it shares a wall with a Panda Express, Roma Garden does not look like the kind of place that would serve some of the best Italian food in Arizona. The interior is far nicer than the outside suggests. It's very cosy, but the unusually large chairs make it a tad difficult to get seated. Entry into the seat closest to the wall was akin to scooting across the seat in a booth. We had little issue with this because none of had to use the restroom during our visit, but I imagine that this would be quite annoying for tables with more active bladders.  The whole menu looks rather large, but in reality a lot of the dishes are just repeats of other dishes, but with different proteins. Not a complaint, just a note.  We started off with the calamari, because it tends to be a good indicator of a restaurant's style. The calamari were breaded slightly more than I would have liked, but I prefer a very light breading. By traditional standards, I'm sure these were just fine. Not the best I've had, but definitely good.  My braised lamb shank, on the other hand, was stellar. The shank was cooked perfectly -- braised just enough to maintain its integrity, while requiring very little coaxing to remove from the bone. The uncomplicated flavor of the lamb worked so well with the chianti-tomato sauce, and pasta on the side was great, too. Our waiter said they make their own pasta, although I'm not sure that if the pasta I ate was homemade. No matter. The sauce killed. The lamb killed. My culinary hubris: massacred.  My sister had the osso bucco; my mom had the pollo Roma Garden; and my dad had the shrimp scampi. All the dishes on the table looked equally appetizing, but I can't say I'd have ordered differently if I could go back and do it again. My dish was just too awesome.  We finished the night with some tiramisu, which, while not a revelation, was very good. I enjoy mine with a hint of rum in it, but my whole family enjoyed it, and so I was overall happy with it.  Service was very friendly. Our server, whose name unfortunately escapes me, was enthusiastic-bordering-on-corny, but I'll take that over lazy and lackadaisical any day. He was on top of everything and very eager to field questions about the food. No complaints here.  The restaurant is less than a mile from my parents' house, and so it seems criminal to not pay Roma Garden a visit the next time I'm in Phoenix. It's not cheap, but the huge portions and even bigger flavors have me won. Definitely my current favorite Italian restaurant.",

The service is always warm and friendly. The owner is a very sweet Italian man who makes sure everyone is enjoying the food and experience.   It is perfect for a romantic dinner. Nice decor and lighting. And the complimentary amaretto shot at the end of dinner is a nice touch.  My husband has ordered a variety of dishes and loved them all. Especially their specials.   I always order their eggplant parm. It is the BEST I have ever had. It comes with a side of pasta and I order it with pesto sauce. AMAZING pesto. Creamy and delicious.  I work close by and occasionally order take out for lunch. Under $9 and comes with bread. The portion is so huge I have lunch for the next day too!  I haven't had dessert there yet but my friend says they make delicious desserts. I have always been to full to try them!  Knowing that Roma Garden exists makes it a crime to go to Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill. For just a little more money, you can have a freshly cooked AUTHENTIC Italian meal instead of that pre-prepared crap that OG and MG serves...",

    "text": "V-Day 2013, destination: Roma Garden Ristorante! Here is the synopsis:  ~Fud/Drink~ Fiance got the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and asparagus. It tasted well and had the flavors just right, the sauces were just a tad bland and oily. I got the Linguini Pescatore with mussels, shrimp and other fresh seafood mixed in a white wine sauce. I see a common theme with the flavors not being too exciting for other diners, which is a shame. Traditional cooking does assume that the flavors aren't supposed to overwhelm the entirety of the dish. If the flavors to you are bland, then I might suggest a place that over-emphasizes sauces, like the Olive Garden. I do agree, the white wine sauce was a less flavorful as others in the past, but I hate tasting the butter in the sauce, its a big turn-off in a dish. You have to  consider you are paying for the seafood, not the sauce...By the way, the seafood tasted fresh as it could be, the mussels  were especially fresh and flavorful. The shrimp also had the flavor you would expect from an animal living in the sea. The seafood was executed flawlessly, thus improving the pasta dish exponentially. The linguini was also cooked perfectly. The wines we shared were paired perfectly for our dishes, and although expensive, really tied the flavors of our dishes together.  Honestly, if you come here, get something that is special. If you get a simple marinara, spaghetti and meatball dish....just why bother? MAKE IT AT HOME, Lazy. Come here to enjoy something that is difficult to execute...that's why you eat out at a nice establishment in the first place. I hate seeing people complain that they can make it at home...Go home and let me try your outstanding dish, I can't wait to try it Emeril! **That sounds just like something Gordon Ramsey would say, with a few \"stupid donkey's\" mixed in.**   ~Atmosphere/Service~ Romantic...is what comes to mind, of course. Its a nice little spot with a cute little room for service, the tables are done up nice. No music is piped in, its a relaxing and calm atmosphere. The bar room area up front is done just right, its not too large/small or pushes into the main room ruining the vibes. High tops are available to sit at as well as a bar to walk up to. Our waitress Jen knew all the specials and did not rush through them on a busy V-Day night. Instead she took time to go over all the options and the wine selection. She provided us the best service I have had in a while from a server. She consistently would come up at the perfect time to check in on us, and she was so personable and friendly. When I mentioned the 10% check in offer (which i was unaware of until I checked in), she immediately gave me the discount with a smile. She received a big tip, she deserved it for making our night even more special. Also the busser was a gentleman, he quietly helped put grated cheese/pepper on our dishes and without us asking put our food in our to-go boxes. The service is excellent.  ~Extras/Rating~ On an excellent note, you get 10% OFF IF YOU CHECK IN ON YELP! YAY! That 10% went right back to our awesome waitress, who got a good tip, haha. We also got a free Amaretto in a glass at the end of the night, really great touch to a wonderful dinner! This is a 4.5 out of 5 in my book, but I will knock it down to 4 stars because of the semi-bland sauce...But its a solid restaurant, instantly my personal favorite family-owned Italian spot. Jen once again was amazing, see if you can get her as your server. I highly recommend this spot!!",

    "text": "Magnifico!   My boyfriend and I went there for dinner Friday night...  We live in the area and have seen the sign, so we decided to check it out.    It's located in a non-descript strip mall on 40th Street and Thunderbird.  Certainly not a fancy shopping center, so you wouldn't expect a whole lot, but BOY OH BOY!  You're in for a treat!   Once you walk in the front doors, you feel like you are in an upper scale lounge.  The decor hits you immediately-- it's has a very upper crust, elegant feel.  The dining room is very elegant, as well, with linen table cloths and napkins, candles, and single red roses.    They have a small, but nice size wine list.   The menu is very impressive with it's choices.   They served a very nice hot bread with herb butter which was delicious.  The dinner salads were wonderful, albeit just a 'titch' too much dressing.  My boyfriend had the Lasagne and I hit the jackpot with the Pollo Roma Garden.  It's a delectable flavored chicken breast topped with the thinnest slice of eggplant and covered with mozzerella cheese and a Tarragon Cream Sauce...  Ooohhh.  Mmmmm.  Geeeeeee.....   To die for, peeps!!!  It was served with a side of penne in a lemon caper sauce.    I'm allergic to tomatoes, so I couldn't try any of the BF's dish, but it smelled like pure heaven.  Besides the excellent food, the service was extraordinary!!  Our waiter was super polite, helpful, as well as the other staffers who filled our waters and brought us bread.    The restaurant was very cozy, very warm, very delicious... and very much our new favorite Italian restaurant.",

Best decision we could have made.   The staff is what really makes this restaurant awesome. You could tell that the regulars had developed relationships with the servers, management, even the chef, and as newcomers, we were treated no different. Our waiter was so nice and pleasant, and really cared for us. Italian food is always the hardest place for me to find something to eat that's actually tasty (I'm gluten intolerant, yikes!) and they were more than willing to make something special for me, even though there were a couple of items listed that I could eat safely.   I got a halibut dish accompanied with mussels, shrimp, rice, and some vegetables. OH. MY. GOD. It was like sex. Whatever that sauce was, it was just perfect, and the fish and mussels were really fresh and flavorful.   I'll definitely be coming back whenever I'm home from school, because this place is just too awesome to pass up.",

    "text": "Last Saturday evening my fiancee and I took her mother and sister here for a special birthday dinner (Mom will be 83 Tuesday!)  We anticipated an outstanding dining experience, especially since my fiancee is a monthly regular here as part of a women's group.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in our evening.  It started out great with a killer martini and some wonderful bread and herb butter.  But after our server, whom we had requested, took our order, everything went into slow motion.  It took forever for our meals to arrive.  The table next to ours (different server) arrived after us, ordered about the same time, was served and left before we received our food.  This isn't just me being picky; everybody in our party noticed the slow, inattentive service.    The good news is that my three companions, including the birthday girl, loved their food.  The bad news is that my shrimp ravioli was tough, chewy, almost leathery.  I ate two of the six and stopped.  if our server would have returned to check on our food, I would have ordered something else, but she didn't.  I would have also ordered desert, but she never returned to ask us until the leftovers (theirs, not mine!) were packed and we were ready to leave.  She did give Mom a free desert to go, but I think all of us would have appreciated getting it in a timely manner and enjoying it there.  To be fair, she was dealing with an unfortunate situation involving an unruly bar customer, though I'm not sure why that was her responsibility.  And when I told her about my order, she immediately took it off our bill.  However, we were still left with the slow, inattentive service and my dinner consisted of bread, Caesar salad and that killer martini.  I was raiding the fridge an hour after we got home.  I may give them another try; my fiancee is already going there tonight with her ladies' group and I'm sure they will have a wonderful experience.  I just wish last Saturday had been worthy of five stars.",

Don't let the location fool you; this place is the best traditional Italian food I've had in Arizona. I had the sausage ravioli and it did not disappoint. Go with the specials!  So glad we found this gem of a place so close to home. No need to drive to Scottsdale for twice the price and half the quality. This place knows what they are doing and their service it spectacular.",

    "text": "I went to have a dinner with my husband yesterday since I was so excited about trying their food from reading yelp review.  If you know how to make Good Italian food at home, this is not the place to go. I am a good cook myself and I found their food mediocre, nothing special. Regular pasta with simple homemade sauce......Not worth $80 of my total bill.   Who said that Veal Alla Parmigianao is great? The meat was supposed to come out crusty, but SOGGY with cheese on top and oily. As I took bite into it,  I felt that the food raised my blood pressure.  After the huge meals, we decided to get some coffee. The coffee tasted like the ones from Circle K.....so sour and burned. It was awful!  How come this high-rated Italian restaurant (according to yelp) knows how to make circle-K coffee?   They do not have a good coffee, trust me. flavor was so cheap and disgusting.  I wont go back to this place even though I liked the energy on busy Friday night.  Food: mediocre, you can make it at home (could taste much better) Ambiance: dated, but not bad. Service: slow, but okay",

The recipes have been around for years and have been consistently delicious and authentic. Serving sizes are huge so go very hungry or be prepared to take home the extras. Warm, fresh bread with awesome herb butter. Good wine selection, nice happy hour and if you want to go in the late afternoon there's a half off early bird special. Don't let the strip mall location fool you, it's so worth going inside for a nice evening",

Liked the atmosphere, it was in a little strip mall, but didn't feel like it when you entered. The host/bar tender/waitress (she did all 3) was very friendly with good service. The downside was the food. It was very average at best. I ordered a seafood past dish and it was just ok. The bread was really good.   The food was not bad, don't get me wrong. I may try again just to see if it was what I ordered. Very average.",

My only warning is to say it's a bit pricey, but really not much more than other local places. We usually eat here for a special occasion. If you are on a budget, save up your money for a special birthday dinner here!",

    "text": "Food was good.   I had the Choppino Fruittas de Mare. Apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me, but the serving was typical for a Fruits de Mare type plate that I've had at other restaurants. Sauce was nice: spicy and good flavor. Pasta was cooked well and the right portion size, I think people add too much pasta to make the dish look larger. Other than the imitation crab (a disappointment but not a deal breaker) the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari, mussels, etc.   Kid's spaghetti was very good. I taste all the kid's spaghetti since I have 3 kids and invariably someone doesn't finish or even start their bowl. The pasta was cooked well, the meatball was decent, but the sauce was shick and chunky (not watery which I hate) and covered all the pasta (which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to do). There isn't a specific kid's menu but the server said they make kid's portion size of anything on the menu but the price isn't available to be seen so you have to trust they aren't going to bend you over on those, which they didn't.   Bread, of course, was available prior to meals. The butter used is very tasty, some type of garlic I think. Bread was warm, soft, and not overcooked.  Now I would have given 4 stars except for a few exceptions: the decor and slower service.   Decor was dreadful, sorry. Old and dated. I think their target demographics is 50 years old or greater as the chairs, pictures, and everything inside screams 1970's. The chairs remind me of an old conference hall. The lighting is on the dark side. I guess if I was out on a date or with 4 retired couples, it would be a nicer decor, but with 8 adults and 5 kids it just doesn't fit quite right.  Kid friendly not quite, but kid accomidating is more like it. Since the ambience is darker and softer volume on conversations, having loud and obnoxious kids is not the right place for them.  Overall, the food is good, servers friendly but not the family friendly place I usually prefer.",

No drinks or anything so it's definitely on the high side of pricing but once I tried the food I totally didn't care. It's in this divey location you'd never consider as a nice place but you walk in and it's totally a date atmosphere and the food is PHENOMENAL.  Easily my favorite Italian food in the valley.

Last year I took them to another Italian restaurant, and my father in law was scanning the menu and said: \"where are the spaghetti and meatballs?\" The waiter at that restaurant replied: \"we don't do spaghetti and meatballs\".  My father in law was not pleased, so I was not going to make that mistake again.  I made our reservations, even though it was during the week.  The restaurant seems to have a regular crowd at the bar.  Our server was very attentive and efficient.  Of course my father in law got his spaghetti and meatballs, actually he asked for half meatballs and half sausage and they were very accommodating.  My mother in law had the eggplant parmesan, my hubby had the special ravioli and I had the cannelloni.  It was delicious.  We finished with a piece of tiramisu cake and coffee.  At the end of the meal they offered us a round of Amaretto.  It was a wonderful meal and my in laws were very happy this year, score!",
