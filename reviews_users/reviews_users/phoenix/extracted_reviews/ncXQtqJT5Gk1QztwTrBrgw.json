    "text": "Let me start by saying the only reason for the second star is because the bagels are fairly legit New York style bagels.  Had we come to the counter for just bagels and left I may have written a different review.  And I've only written one other Yelp review before.  That's how badly I need to counteract the positive reviews on here.  We were seated promptly because there were only 2 other people in the restaurant despite having 6 nosey employees roaming around including a bartender at 1030 am on a Monday.  Maybe there was a lunch rush coming? Not sure based on our experience.  The waiter was nice but had no clue about a single menu item.  And someone there decided to give these poor people tablets to carry around.  There is a reason good restaurants don't carry around computers.  He fumbled through my questions and the tablet like a long drawn out B movie.  I could barely help from rolling my eyes but I felt bad for the guy that management though tablets were a good idea.  The food came very quickly.  Like super fast probably because no one else was there.  I ordered a Spanish omelet that was  supposed to come with salsa. It was a joke.  Luke warm with a few peppers and onions and a square of melted cheese just plopped on top and probably put under a warmer.  *I'll post a photo!*  There was no salsa therefore nothing Spanish about it.  The potatoes were ok but also not hot.  Probably from a warmer.  My boyfriend ordered standard scrambled eggs and sausage and was relatively happy but he also laughed at my sad omelet.    Then a waiter came over and said to him (boyfriend) at his empty plate, \"guess you hated it.  Don't know how we keep the doors open here. Hahaha.\"  But apparently  he didn't look at my plate.  I wasn't hungry enough to finish my joke plate.  BUT the bagel was good and came as a side with the meal.  I have a feeling the waiter overheard us talking about the horrible choice we made for breakfast and tried to be funny.  He's another reason I wrote this review.  Our poor waiter was sweet but clueless.  This place is odd and sad and I don't recommend anyone go there unless they need a quick bagel but there are plenty of bagel places around.",

I have a big problem with the loud mouth red head  Sherry. Ruth is off in her own little world.  There were 2 new guys that just started training today. We observed them in the food well with NO gloves on. One was reaching in his pocket to get his cell phone with a glove on.  That glove should of been removed, hands washed and re gloved.   We mentioned this to the Red Head and she came back with some snotty comment.   This is not the first time. We mentioned our concern to Ruth the last time.    My Husband is in the food service industry and works very close with the board of health.    As reading all the reviews this place is going downhill. What a shame.  Our New Years Resolution is to not dine at this establishment anymore.   Shelly is awesome but she can't do it all.

Uh, then what's the point of listing the soup of the day for each day of the week on the menu? The soup tasted like flour and nothing else.  The bialy looked like a breadstick. I told the waitress I ordered the bialy, not the bialy stick(also a menu item). I was told that's what their bialys look like. I don't know what bagels and bialys these owners tried in new york, but if they tasted anything like these bagels and bialys, I'm sure they're no longer in business.",

First impressions......it's huge inside, every single employee is smiling as if they actually LIKE their jobs! We sat at the bar. Not for liquor, although they do indeed have what looks like a well stocked bar.  As has been mentioned already here on Yelp, the menu is ginormous, and everything that comes out from the cooks in back looks amazing.  Their story is on the menu, and it appeared that both of the founding women were there, and they along with EVERY employee were upbeat and talkative. I haven't even gotten to the food yet..... I ordered the breakfast burrito upon Nick our server's reco, and it was huge and fresh and yummy! My wife ordered a 9 grain bialy, and a scoop of tuna salad and a scoop of chicken salad. They are apparently known for their bagels and bialys as the name implies. It's True, the bialy was Uber soft and tasty. The bar was busy, but relaxed and Nick our server was very funny, friendly and entertaining, though not bothersome. He's a fabulous bartender! I could see him making lots of money at a full on liquor establishment as a bartender, though it seems he's quite comfortable right where he's at.  Frankly, it seemed all of their employees like what they are doing there, and for a restaurant, that's quite an accomplishment.  We can't wait to go back. And we WILL indeed return. I must try out more of their fabulous menu.  You MUST give these guys a try if you're in the North Scottsdale corridor!!",

    "text": "With restaurants or any other business you cant be perfect all the time but it's how you deal with issues when they happen that makes the difference. New York Bagels 'N Bialys failed on all counts.  We were out running errands and wanted to grab a quick bite for lunch and we thought deli and knew we were close to NYB&B. Both my wife and I ordered a cup of Matzah Ball soup along with another dish. When the soup arrived both my wife and I found that neither the soup or matzah ball had any flavor whatsoever and basically tasted pretty close to hot water. We politely mentioned to our server who took them away and she asked if we would like anything else instead. We initially declined but when she asked if we were sure we asked for some fries and somebody that seemed like a manager came along and presented us with 2 baskets of fries and apologized for the soup issue. So far that is exactly what you would expect in terms of custom,er service.  Then the bill came and we had been charged extra for the fries!. When we pointed this out assuming it was a mistake they simply said we ordered them and must pay for them. We spoke to the same manager who had brought them expecting a correction but got the same treatment. In the end we just paid and won't be back along with the many friends and family who will will be telling about our experience.  Correcting a small issue in a restaurant is simple and leads to a loyal customer base where you recommend them and extol their customer service when they dealt appropriately with a food quality issue. Go the other way and for the sake of 2 portions of french fries you lose multiple customers and probably thousands of dollars in future business.  There are many great NY style Delis in Scottsdale but I would avoid New York Bagels 'N Bialys. The soup tastes like nothing and their customer service is similarly watery!!",

I prefaced our interaction by saying \"Hi, I have a voucher on Yelp\" because I believe it's customary to let someone know that you have a coupon or voucher before you place an order... and his response was \"I didn't ASK you about your Yelp- I asked you what you WANTED\" in a very patronizing, blunt, and forceful way. I politely let him know that I was just asking because I wanted to make sure that I was able to use the discount, and he cut me off and repeated himself. My mom and I couldn't believe the way we were being treated and spoken to, so we left. Now I am trying to get a refund from Yelp for the money that I spent. We had great memories from a previous day we had spent together and had lunch here, so we drove a long distance to come back just to eat here. It was a very disheartening experience. I will never support this rude business ever again.",

I can tell you that in the 15 minutes I stood there several customers that came after me were helped and served toasted bagels. Why was I ignored? I finally asked for a refund and then they actually put a bialy in the toaster for me. What a complete joke this place is, how rude! And NO apologies from anyone!",

I needed something quick to eat on the way to a morning meeting, so pulled up the handy Yelp mobile app and found this spot just a stone's throw away.    I walked in and the first thing that hits me is: \"What the hell is a 'bialy?'\"  Fortunately, an employee was there to help me understand that a bialy is baked and a bagel is boiled.  So: it's the texture, not the stuffing.  I decide to get one of each toasted with no spreads.    I think I spent less than $1.50, but I don't remember the exact amount.  Regardless, it was a small price to pay for some delicious culinary research.  In my ever so humble opinion, I like the texture of bagels compared to the bialy.  Taste-wise, they were both much yummier than that nationwide chain you always see on every corner.  I only went here to grab a quick breakfast, but they have different options that I would love to come back for and give another shot.",

We were never without it. My wife ordered the everything bagel. It was delicious, crunchy, and full of flavor. I ordered the slam #2. Pancakes were thick not fluffy but good. Sausage was awesome. Potatoes ehh not so much could have been more crunchy and better seasoned. Just my preference. Also hit a bialy to go. Soft and crunchy outside makes this thing amazing.   Anyways we are going back. New York feel, comfort food, and a bar. I'm sold!",

I needed a food donation for a High School event I was helping with, and the owners here jumped in without a moments' hesitation! When I went to pick them up, they had bags and bags of bagels ready, and even added more to the piles before I could make it out the door. I must confess that I ate one on my way to the event venue and that bagel was one of the best I've EVER eaten! I appreciate this restaurant's generosity, community involvement, and the quality of their product. NY Bagel's 'N Bialys are on my list of breakfast spots to try this summer...see you there!",

I get bagels to go, and the last time I was there the kid making the bagels had no food service gloves on, and was taking money, making bagels, etc. Not the end of the world, but it does kind of junk you out. Another odd thing is that when you like your bagels double toasted, for some reason they put SO much butter on, it's almost like the bagel is deep fried. I haven't been back since the kid had poor food hygiene practices, but I need to get back there.",

Came with the proper veggies and an onion bagel. My wife had the matzoh ball soup (which needed no extra sal or pepper) and wonderfully lean pastrami. Rachelle took such great care of us; she's obviously  used to detailed orders from folks. Think Harry and Sally and you know that a server who can do that cheerfully is a treasure.

We stopped in one Sunday morning for some breakfast.   I was told not to expect too much personality from the waitstaff, but our waiter seemed really cool.  He stopped to chat with us for a few minutes between refilling coffee and delivering our plates. Speaking of coffee...I LOVE the brew NYB&B serves!  Mmmmmm.   I had the veggie egg white omelette with salsa on the side.  While they didn't skimp on veggies or egg whites, it was thrown together rather hastily and the salsa was reminiscent of ketchup.  The best part of my meal was the whole wheat bialy (which has fewer cals than a bagel because it's only baked--not boiled and baked like a bagel).   My companion had chocolate chip pancakes. A little doughy for his taste, but I found them addicting...akin to the temptation to eat raw cake batter.  I liked them...  I'll come back even if it's just for a cup of coffee. The on-site bakery was cooking up some pretty scrumptious goods, something to keep in mind for the future.",

    "text": "My east coast Jew taste buds are dancing today! I just ate an everything bagel stick, toasted lightly, with cream cheese...  We happened to be in Scottsdale for dinner and, in looking for our restaurant, we passed NY Bagels 'n Bialys. The \"open\" sign was all we needed to go in. We haven't had a good bagel since we left Boston. And I hadn't had a good bialy since we left Cleveland in the 90s.  When we went in we saw this gargantuan menu. They make tons of flavors in bagels and bialys. Plus they make sticks. I haven't had a bagel stick in forever, either. It took about two minutes to pick out a dozen. I could barely contain my excitement. They sliced them up for us, gave us some sleeves so we could freeze what we wouldn't eat right away and sent us on our way, $9 lighter but infinitely happier.  And I am not disappointed. It has been so long since I had a real, east coast bagel that I forgot how good they are. They doughy faux Jew food they have here just dulls the senses and makes a person forget the amazing deliciousness that we enjoy back in the real \"Jew food world\" of the east.  That said, I do have to add one caution. When I saw they also serve sandwiches I asked to taste their corned beef. I do this everywhere I see they serve it and restaurants are always kind enough to oblige. After my anticipated success with the bagels, and the whitefish and lox I saw in the case I was optimistic. Made getting my hopes dashed even worse. As soon as she set the slice in front of me I knew. Color, consistency, texture - nothing was right about this corned beef. Still, I asked for it so I felt I had to taste it. My husband described it as perfectly good Irish corned beef. I described it as dreck.  So my review is strictly for the bagels, bialys and sticks. Enjoy!",

The bagels were a little pricey - nearly $4 for a bagel with cream cheese, but it was quite tasty; however, they put entirely too much cream cheese on the bagel.  I had to wipe off over half of the cream cheese.  I'll definitely stop in again for a proper breakfast.",

    "text": "I was excited to see a new breakfast place open near us in Scottsdale and went there with high hopes..the place is really nice and clean but thats where the positives stopped unfortunately.   CONS not food related:  service wasnt bad, but not very attentive considering we where two of maybe 4 people there.  We were never asked how our food was or got water or coffee refills.  It was also strange that the windows inside the restaurant were being washed suring business hours by a third party up on a ladder with cleaning fluids right above where the place setting and utensils were sitting AND only a few feet away from where we were eating. I'm not a prude but that was a bit strange.   CONS food related:  food was \"Meh\". Not bad but not good..by food I am referring to the main breakfast. It was far from memorable, underseasoned across the board and the waiteress didn't notice that my fiance's potatoes that are included in most of the meals on the menu were'nt on the plate. Now for the bagels...for all the bragging and build up on the website they were a massive disappointment.  My fiance grew up in NJ and NY and she was very excited until she tasted them. Asiago bagel... was completed under cooked (doughy) and barely toasted at all..basically unedible. Might have said something but the waitress never really came back ao we just didn't eat it. There is definitely a quality control issue here and with the owner onsite i would expect her to be tasting and checking food  Anyways, not terrible overall but completly forgettable. Probably will not return. It's a shame the basics like seasoning and cooking bagels completely is a challenge for this place",

I stumbled upon it by accident but I remember breathing the biggest sigh of relief when I walked in and it felt like home.  It has a classic NY deli feel, classic Jewish food, Dr. Browns soda, any bagel or bialy that you could imagine, great food, great service, hamentashen, halva, and all the things that make me feel right at home.   I almost never have time to come in these days but just now finding out that they offer delivery through Grub Hub is a game changer. I work just down the street so now I don't have to wait for free time for my comfort food. :)  That being said, I still recommend going in to the restaurant for the full experience. My server, Julie, was particularly great. She was very accommodating and patient while I read through the menu. Each item was so tempting that it made it hard to make a choice!  NY Bagels and Bialys is a must!",

For my other part of the choose two I got the half cheese-steak.  I told them no mushroom and peppers but to keep the onions.  It came out loaded with mushrooms.  The waitress said they were onions.  I told her they were mushrooms and picked them out to show her.  She said sorry and let me get you a new one.  The new one came out and it was dry and the onions were not even grilled well.

    "text": "So . . . many years ago I worked for a Jewish family from New York who owned a bagel shop in St. Louis on Euclid (Basically Bagels). People flocked there and for good reason. The owners were amazing people, but the bagels and bialys were unmatched. For years, I've had cravings and have periodically settled for round bread. But I just discovered this place, and these are the real deal. Take home a dozen and freeze them (bagels or bialys). My kids had one every morning last week for breakfast. I just put them in the oven on low for 10 minutes, but you could just toast them. Don't bother with bagels from the grocery store. Once you eat these, you won't settle for that other stuff. The texture is perfect. I'm partial to the everything bagel. My only \"complaint\" is that they didn't have nut bagels, as that was one of our huge bestsellers: honey walnut bagels. But with nut prices being what they are, I imagine that might be tough. :)",

First, why so many stupid flavors? Leave that to Panera or the supermarket. Bagels, in a place like this should have about 6-8 varieties. There is no place for chocolate chip or blueberry. That is what cookies and danishes are for. The bagels have an okay taste and texture. The name may say NY, but not NYC, maybe Schoharie? The bialy is not even that good when it is good, so i its not perfect, it fails, and in this case, it just doesn't pass. There is nothing wrong with NY Bagels and Bialys, its just not that great, but for a bagel and cream cheese on a Sunday morning with the NY Times, its okay. The bagels over at Chompie's are actually a little better.",

I tried to order a simple BLT on a bagel  and had to repeat my order 4 times because the lady taking it kept turning around and talking to the staff.  After she finally paid attention to me for more then 5 seconds and put my order in, they guy making the sandwich comes around to verify what she put into the system.  Of course it was wrong so I clarified directly with him that I just wanted a plain BLT on a bagel.  Pretty simple right???  Well, I knew I should have double checked my order before leaving as the BLT was smothered with mustard and the bagel was stale.  Who puts mustard on a BLT?!?  Especially after I gave her my order 4 times and then directly verified it with the guy making it.  Not to mention that the lady behind the counter was touching food with her bare hands and then handling money.

If your compairing this place to Chompies then my vote is Chompies hands down no contest. Even thou I spen $10 on a sandwich there I always leave happy, full, and sometimes with a doggie bag cause you get your moneys worth and its good enough to want again later.

    "text": "I don't claim to be an expert on bagels, but my grandfather was a Jewish baker in Buffalo...I think we have tried every bagel place in the Phoenix metro area, since moving here 5 years ago.  Without doubt,  these are not only the best, but are perfect!     Absolutely boiled, crunchy on the outside, doughy on the inside --- exactly as a bagel is meant to be.  Breakfasts are fantastic -- my husband loves the deli omelet loaded with deli meats and I go the Greek omelet route, with spinach and feta.  And the breakfast potatoes are to die for.     And should you ever need catering, Bagels 'N Bialys is great to work with.  They'll substitute and help you create exactly what you want.  Ruth, the manager is a doll and her staff is always friendly and customer-service is their mantra!  My only disappointment: they have cut back on their hours.  I hope that is just for the summer.",

I ordered the onion rings (instead of the fruit salad since the fruit had an upcharge). After my food is delivered, I get a text telling me to check my email. In the email, I was informed that they were charging me extra ($3) for ordering onion rings. Which, by the way, were soggy, greasy, inedible and packed into a plastic container clearly not meant for onion rings.   Did I mention that I was charged extra AFTER the food arrived?   The chicken noodle soup tasted delicious and fresh and it's the only reason that they didn't just get 1 star. Oh...and they didn't bring any silverware (or napkins), so I just consumed the soup as though it was a drink and used some chopsticks I had on hand for the veggies and noodles.   I will not order from NYBnB again. Maybe it's better if you dine in, but I'll never find out.",

They have a great selection of both bagels and bialys, and gave me an extra flavor to try since they were out of a few that I wanted to try.  The eggs were light and fluffy.  The coffee was great.  There are several things on the menu that I need to go back and try.  The only thing I would change is not to have them bag up the bagels so quickly in the early afternoon so I could get a chance to try more of them individually.",

Although it was a bit of a wait, I could not have been happier with my meal.  I had one of the hot corned beef sandwiches with a side of wedge fries.  It was such a simple dinner, but packed with flavor and super lean meat.  Very little fat.  Our server was kind and attentive as well.    My mother ordered the Cobb salad which she literally said was the best salad she ever had.  The potato pancakes and matzo ball soup were also good.   For dessert we stopped by the pastry counter and got some cookies and an eclair.  They were delicious and we finished them as soon as we got back to the hotel.    5 stars because the food was so simple and done so right.  Would definitely go back.",

The bread on the grinder was awesome but both of us thought the Ruben was WAY better. The onion rings were basic but good and the fries were definitely above standard fries.   The person at the door who sat us was great! We had our 2 year old daughter and asked for a booth. There was not one free at the time. As soon as one emptied he hustled to get it bussed and asked if we wanted to move. That is going above and beyond!  I wanted to give 5 stars but we had a couple snags. One we ordered a large OJ but got a small and one of our sandwiches came out wrong. Our server was apologetic and got it fixed quickly on both accounts. Maybe she was just having an off day. Nothing that would keep us from coming back again and again. Hopefully our timing was just off and next time we will update to the full 5 stars.  Did I mention you should try the Ruben?",

Not only do they have close to four dozen different varieties of bagels and bialys, but they have history... they've been around since 1987; they have fabulous service (thanks to Angela, who was my waitress the last two visits), they are kid friendly, ad they make a good bagel with lox and omelette.  They also have a check-in offer on the yelp app... check it out!  I'm sure I'll be back to visit NYBNB soon... as a matter of fact, I already have a date planned with friends to return again during Passover.  Matzoh Brie, here I come!

New York Bagels N' Bialys makes there own, I imagine that you can't ruin an egg, but you sure can ruin a Lox and Bagels.   Here, the bagel came in a multitude of ways, regular and open face. I've found open face is easier to eat. I ordered the everything bagel and Nova Lox. It was Felicia the waitress who asked if I wanted it toasted, if I wanted capers and cucumber. She did a great job and was very friendly.   My bagel and lox were great, very tasty and the bagel was exceptional and that's the big difference, but it was Felicia that told me about there Bialys, she said that they were 90 calories as opposed to 300 calories, drat, I'll guess I'll have to go back. I love Bialys too.  Felicia the waitress was exceptional, she brought me back to a time when all my work friends would hang out for breakfast and we had are own personalized waitstaff. It's always great to meet a character.   So the ambiance, the food and the staff reached out and touched me, brought me back to a time in my past. BRAVO!!!",

I'm amazed that you could mess up a blt that bad and charge that much! In Manhattan I could get a blt for 6 dollars at a high end bagel store. It's not even the price because if it's delicious you spend to eat good but it was just atrocious!!!",

First of all I order a bialy with chives cream cheese tell him to add some pastrami n spicy mustard.. I also ordered a plain bagel with cream cheese for my son-a coffee and a side of fries.. Grand total over $29!! I was like huh!?  I told the gentleman why he proceeded to say it's pastrami sandwich.. PASTRAMI SANDWICH!? He said no worries I'll make it a small sandwich.. GRAND TOTAL $26 n change! WOW! At that time I was like whatever I'm in the way to visit a close family member at the hospital as I'm leaving my son says where are the fries?? I tell the gentleman n he says sorry let me get them.. I WATCH HIM PLACE THE FRIES IN THE THE TO GO CONTAINER AND REARRANGES THEM WITH HIS NASTY HANDS THAT HE JUST USED TO TOUCH THE REGISTER!! To top it all off the taste was honestly horrible especially for a $17.00 BAGLE!! Ya I'M OUT THIS WAS A VERY FIRST N LAST TIME I'M GOING THERE.. Sorry but sometimes all it takes is a bad employee to make a bad mark on a business.. Sad.. I HOPE THE OWNER READS THIS.. If not it would be sad for him not to know this..",

A ham and cheese omelet is scrambled eggs with ham chopped in it, and a piece of cold unmelted cheese on top. The latkes are so heavy and oily, and not crisp at all. I've tried several menu items and was disappointed in all of them. Go for the bagels, skip the rest. And the coffee is nothing to get overly excited about either.

    "text": "We got our food through door dash delivery so this review is just based on the food, not the ambiance. I ordered the Humble Benedict (with corned beef and hash) and my fiance ordered the Ricardo omelette with a bialy on the side. The bialy itself was just okay, the cream cheese spread was pretty good though. My fiance said the Ricardo omelette was decent and he would give it 3 stars.   My Benedict was terrible. The corned beef was full of gristle. Every other bite I had to chew down into unbreakable fat. There was one big unchopped flab of corned beef in the mix and I couldn't chew it. I had to pick it up out of my food and put it to the side. The sauce was terrible. If it was supposed to be hollandaise, they failed. It was basically velveeta on top of eggs. The eggs were over poached, more hard yolk than soft (it's possibly it kept cooking while on its way through delivery so I'll keep that in mind). The latkes were fine, not bad but not amazing. And the house potatoes were standard.   I really dislike giving bad reviews. I don't want to contribute to bringing a business down. But my food was so bad that I'm honestly angry they took my money for it. You can't advertise as a breakfast/brunch and not even get the eggs and hollandaise somewhat right. I'm not picky, I'll pretty much pack anything down my gullet. But I literally couldn't chew parts of my food. There's no shame in ordering your corned beef and hash premade and adding it to the dish....But if you're going to house-make your own, and advertise it as such, you better know what you're doing.",

She made it a point to ask each one of us, how we were with the quality of food, as well as the Service. For me, and my Grandson it was truly a wonderful experience. This  woman was so personable, truly concerned  &  made it a point  to speak with each person.

We were on the hunt for Lox and ran across this place here on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  To our surprise, they had more than just bagels and we actually forgot about the Lox and ordered an California omelet, potato pancakes, a blueberry bagel, and an asiago bagel the first morning.  Amazing! The bagels were soft and chewy and oh the potato pancakes...served with just the right amount of apple sauce and sour cream. The next morning we finally remembered the Lox and it was hands down the best we've ever had.  The salmon was fresh and they served it with just amount of veggies, cream cheese, and capers.  We also tried the heavenly hash and it was that, heavenly.  It's house made and not at all greasy.  Ironically we noticed that everyone coming in for counter service was ordering an everything bagel with a smear so we go two of those to go and I'm so happy we did.  We actually didn't eat them until the next morning once we got home and they were amazing; slightly sweet and savory all in one bite.  We can't wait to visit the Scottsdale / Phoenix area again so we can stop in for breakfast again.",

I will save you the time of having to read the full play by play of my last two experiences there, but suffice it to say that it was a deal breaker. I'd complained about the food, and the manager came out NOT to apologize or ask how she could fix it, but to get in my face about it and tell me that I was actually wrong because that is \"how the dish is\" (?). A dish I have probably eaten there over a dozen times.   There are a couple of good servers but the service has always been average overall, but I forgave it because the food was good. But now that the food has also gone downhill, I am done. I have two other bagels spots nearby that are now better food and better service by comparison.",

    "text": "The first thing you notice is the smell.   If I hadn't have been starving, I would have walked out.   The place is dark and dreary, with a wait staff to match.  Clearly they have their own little dramas going on that trump customer service.  But to be fair, they do all call you \"sweetie\" and \"honey\"  once they get around to showing up, there's the consolation. My meal came fairly quickly, so no complaints there.  The food was actually decent.  I had the smoked whitefish salad appetizer, which was a nice plate for a single diner like myself.   The platter included a nice helping of whitefish salad, cream cheese,  lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, capers, olives and pickles along with a toasted bagel.   The salad was very smoky and  tasty, and everything seemed fresh except for the olives, which were very strange and mushy.  The problem with trying to eat in a place that smells so bad and looks so dirty is that it's hard to get past all of that to really enjoy the food.  I just kept wondering what state the kitchen was in.   So, despite the decent food, I have to give this place a two star rating.   Maybe call Robert Irvine!   Unless it's freshened up and the smell is gone, I'm not going back.  Not even for such good whitefish salad!",

When I got home I opened the box and there was a dry chicken breast on toast. I went all the way back there and asked for sliced chicken on plain wheat bread. They took the same dried up chicken breast and cut it into little pieces and threw in two slices of bread not even bothering to put it together. I also got a plain bialy which was stale. I wasted my time and money going back there they were uncaring and I would not recommend anyone ever going to this place. The people who used to own it were so wonderful! Now they have employees who don't care enough about their customers to do what it takes to bring them back. Do not go there!",

    "text": "Our visit was in a word, sad.  And I REALLY hate having to say that. Me and my S.O. were looking forward to trying this place, with him being from New York we are always on the lookout for a good bagel.   We were seated promptly, so no problems there. The waiter came and offered to bring coffee or water as we were perusing the menu - still good. The problems came when we ordered. I ordered a nova lox sand which and I had the Yelp offer for the mimosa for 1 cent. So I tried to order it and the waiter cut me off and said he'd do that at the  end, not realizing I was trying to order the mimosa and not just trying to cash in on a separate Yelp deal. But. Whatever. S.O. Ordered the morning pile up. We got our food moderately fast and one fill up on our coffee. I still wanted a mimosa and I was going to order a black and white Cookie and a raspberry rugalah. But when our waiter returned he never asked if we wanted anything else-he simply dropped off the bill without saying a word.  He never even asked if the food was good or if we needed a water, nothing. He offered the table next to us to pack up their coffee to go and I would've liked the same but he never asked. I will say that I know the waiter may have been having a rough day, but still. A little common kindness goes a really long way. I was hoping for a great experience and a new breakfast spot, and I ended up with neither.   In summary - Coffee was just ok. Food was ok. (The morning pile up was a mess and tasted bland. My nova lox bagel was actually pretty good) Service was less than I hoped for and I strongly doubt that we will ever return.",

I've never seen an employee in a bad mood -- and the owners (Ruth and Shelly) interact with customers like they are family.  The meats are lean and fresh. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming - and perfect for dogs too (outside patio is dog-friendly). The breads, deserts, everything... delicious and very reasonably priced - especially when you consider some of the places in Scottsdale seem to charge more as the portion size goes down!  Do yourself a favor, next time you have a desire for a good old-fashioned deli sandwich, or a True NY style bagel or bialy... go to New York Bagels and Bialys. I'll be there again tomorrow morning...",

I got a bite into my bagel and it was heaven.  The right amount of chewiness.  I immediately asked where these bagels came from, and I was not alone, everyone at the party was doing the same.  That's when I learned about NYBB.  Now every time someone has a brunch or breakfast party, I always suggest they get their bagels.  If I am going to indulge, I better do it with great ones.  I am not from NY but a am a confirmed carb-aholic, so I think this counts as credentials. On top of everything, the owner was so amazing.  I was organizing an event for one of my parenting groups, and one of the donors backed out 4 days before the event.  I was panicking, we had a small budget and we were almost out of it since we were counting on this donation.  I called NYBB and Ruth answered.  I told her what had happened and asked her if she could give us a special discount, guess what?  She donated the bagels for our event.  That is so classy.  I am thrilled that our event has the best bagels.",

    "text": "Ever since the Lox Stock and Bagel location closed, we've been looking for an authentic NY style bagel and diner to go with the family. New York Bagels 'N Bialys certainly delivers above and beyond anything that we could've ever dreamed of.   The menu is extensive and has everything you could ever dream of wanting for breakfast. From the griddle, to bagel sandwiches, to a full Deli lunch menu.  Nick was our server and did a spectacular job of serving our lunch party while keeping things light and fun. Our group had several bagel sandwiches, lox, the Reuben, and corn beef hash with the potato pancakes (the humble hash). All of which we would certainly order again. The bagels ended up being so good that we got a dozen to go.   I would highly recommend Bagels 'N Bialys to everyone passing through or living in the Scottsdale  or Phoenix area.",

The deli meat and matzo ball soup are two of my favorites. Another favorite is their jalapeno jelly. I get this to go with bagel chips and plain cream cheese. Amazing! My friend goes ham on the NYBB pile up and it is phenomenal. All in all, highly recommend if you're looking for an authentic deli or just a great meal",

Customers may choose the size of portions from Nosh, Plate, Platter. The White Fish is excellent. The Pickles, Cucumbers, Tomatoes are fresh.  Service is good. We took Uber to the Deli on the first day, on the second day, I discovered the doors were locked and the hours limited to 3 pm. However, this place is worth the trip, try it. They even have a bar.

If you've stumbled across this place by accident or via Yelp, you're in the right place.  The bagels are soft, tasty, and LOTS to choose from.   There is a Day-Old rack next to the door if you're looking for something in bulk or maybe want to get the most out of a gift card. But, day-old might cause the bread to be a little more firmer that you're liking, so go with the fresh and be certain to enjoy a wonderful bagel or bialy.    Don't forget to ask for Nick if you're planning to dine in. He's wonderful!!!",

But, you're in a bagel shop, so don't leave w/o getting a bagel... You'll likely want to leave with a bag for home or the road; There's no judgement or guilt as I did the same   I'm sure the other servers are wonderful too, but might as well ask for Nick if you want to be certain to have a great experience..  If you're undecided on what to order, give the \"Humble Hash\" a try; it's terrific!  Stop in as this is certainly a no-disappointment zone...  If you're scrolling through Yelp reviews & see \"Mary L.\" from March 2019, TRUST ME, don't give her slanted opinion any weight at all... The bagels here are very soft with the right amount of texture...   Pro-Tip: this location is located directly next door to Total Wines & More; Say no more!!  Enjoy!!",

Upon coming inside, we were warmly greeted by the staff and were sat at a booth. Our waiter was super nice and attentive.   I got the Mexican omelette with an Asiago bagel with chive cream cheese. My boyfriend got the chicken fried steak with an everything bagel with place cream cheese. Everything was so delicious. If I were to make any critique, it would be my omelet might have been a little salty. Still devoured it, so obviously I didn't mind much. The bagel were excellent, and they gave a perfect amount of cream cheese.  Left happy and stuffed. Would definitely recommend.",

I'm a huge fan of New York Bagel and Bialy in Lincolnwood,  and it was such a pleasant surprise to discover another location in Scottsdale on our last day in town. What a perfect way to stay connected so far away. It turns out one of the owners of the Lincolnwood location retired and moved to Scottsdale to open another restaurant.   The bagel assortment at this location is huge. The bagel recipe appeared to be the same, and the business is family owned. The difference is that this restaurant is full service with generous seating. Since we were headed to our next road trip destination, we got our orders to go. Note: They have a really convenient take-it-to-go area. We ordered cinnamon raisin bagels, bagel sandwiches with bacon and cheese, and ginormous chocolate milk to go..mixed up just for our boys.   If we get the chance to visit Scottsdale again, New York Bagels 'N Bialys will be on our stop for sure.",

The deli itself is pleasant and clean on the inside but lacks that amazing aroma of baked goods and deliciousness. I was disappointed that they did not have a yummy looking pastry case, which is always a hit with me .   They do offer an enormous menu with options for just about anyone whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner. You can customize your own with a vast array of breads, bagels, meats, and cheeses etc. or you can choose from their recommended specialities. I gave NY Bagels and Baileys two attempts; the first I ordered the Rueben with coleslaw and next I ordered a club sandwich. Unfortunately their portion sizes were very small compared to the pictures that they boast on the menu, the price was hefty for the size (despite the mailer coupon), and the taste just was not there. I expected fresh baked bread and juicy meats and what I got was somewhat stale and flavorless.   The staff in this restaurant are all extremely warm and eager to help. Everyone has a smile and is working hard. I'd love to give this deli more than 3 stars, but it just isn't that great.",

Real unfortunate because if youre going to be way more expensive than einsteins bagels then you need a little personality.

We ordered the bottomless memosa score $15, a Bloody Mary, the Reuben sandwich and a bagel sandwich. All of it was great! The service was friendly and the place was clean. We are excited to call this our new watering hole. They have something for everyone on the menu! This is truly a little gem of Scottsdale! And great that it's next door to wine & more so if you want to take your breakfast/brunch drinking home you can stop in on your way home & grab what you need! Thanks for the great service guys! Can't wait to come back!",

Very, very frustrating and we drive out of the way and have been coming here for over 7 years (we followed their change in location). So yes, the fix the problem but they will screw it up again, as expexted. When the problem is butter vs cream cheese, toasted vs not toasted, or a bagel that has jalenpenos in it vs a plain bagel???? How do you screw this up? And then you GIVE ME BACK MY RETURNED ITEM TO KEEP???SERIOUSLY!?  H&H Bagels has come to Tempe so no longer driving out of my way to NYBB. I'll take Big City Bagels or the H&H, thank you!",

After trying a more local place on a non-work day, that particular place's lox (same price) was White Castle-like bite-size. The only place I found lox cheaper was a large chain restaurant (let's just say), although thinking about it now it was on promotional sale.   I now give the crown officially to NYBB for their fair prices, great staff, and nice ambience. Best local bagel place and I got to try and enjoy my first Bialy here (I've only heard of them growing up in NY originally). I haven't drank here as I only stop by on the way to work so this review is based off of pre 10am experiences.",

Because they washed the dishes but didn't make sure they were dry before putting the bread on the plate. The chicken soup was so salty we couldn't eat it. The Knish was greasy, and the pastrami was definitely not NY Pastrami. If you're from NY you know what I'm talking about. We eat as much as we can stomach and decide rather than wasting the food we would take it home. Don't know why. The waitress brings us two huge takeout containers for a half a sandwich and nothing for the soup. I question if I was to pour the soup into one of the sandwich containers and she stares at me and then asked if I want a container for the soup. I make a sigh. She comes back with a small container meant for cream cheese spread. Even I can see this isn't going to work, but I try. I was right. Between soggy bread, over salted soup, Pastrami no self respecting New Yorker would dare serve, and a waitress that seemed to need a lot more training, we left feeling sad for the experience. If you want a really good Deli that truly honors NY, go to Scott's Generations on 7st and Glendale Ave. But as for NY B'NB, forget about it!!",

Not even  Two hours after he ate, he was so sick. I won't get into details.  The whitefish salad was horrible, potato pancake was flavorless.   The bagels were stale. They don't know how to make a chocolate egg cream at all. It should be removed from menu. Place was not very clean either.  My Bialy which I was so looking forward too was SO Stale as well.   If you've ever tasted a REAL  bagel or bialy, then you know. Otherwise this place should take the \"New York \" off their sign. It's no where near New York food!

Its family run and the staff is veey friendly, efficient and helpful.  My wife and I had lunch (a Reuben and a fish platter and our kids ate breakfast egg on a bagel and a huge portion of kids french toast for the price we actually had to take some home) We loved it.  Very pleasant experience.  The owners son actually waited on us,  adding to the family atmosphere. He was very helpful explaining to my wife what bialys were.  Our food was out within 5min of us ordering us and he was very attentive.   Checking in on us every few minutes.  They even suggested they we come back on a Wednesday since you get a free 6 bagels with every dozen you buy.  One of the best breakfast experiences we have had in years. Highly recommend to people who like traditional jewish food...although its not completely kosher a large portion of the food is.  We'll be back and probably bring some of our gentile friends so they can learn what a REAL bagel is",

Not a huge fan but it was often convenient to pick up on my way to work especially when you add the goodies like cream cheese, lox, or make it into a tasty sandwich.    All in all if you are looking for bagels or bialys think these are better than chompies.  They've moved across the street from their old location although i  cant say that i like the new setup either.  what's with all of t he flatscreen tvs? if that's where they spent the $ for improvements i hope they got them from a guy selling electronics from a truck in a parking lot.   they seem to have some sort of identity conflict as to whether they are a deli or a sports bar.   as to the food i've been there for a so-so breakfast and of course had the pastrami and reuben sandwiches both of which were pretty good.  while a little bit traditional deli, note that they were not traditional ny carnegie-sized meat portions considering the sandwiches are close to $10 including a side.",

We didn't realize it was an actual sit-down restaurant..cool!    Our visit started out with some awesome people watching - thanks to the girl wearing last night's make-up, a guy's Dodgers shirt, and nothing else.  Our group then decided to order omelettes, because the omelettes also came with a bagel or bialy.  This was our mistake - don't go to a bagel place expecting good omelettes, I guess.  All of our eggs were extremely over-cooked and not tasy.  The Leo omelette (Lox and onions) was pretty much scrambled eggs - not even in an omelette shape.  The bagels, however, were very delicious, but not much different from any other bagel I've had.  Our server was very efficient, though.  All in all, it was a quick and cheap-ish breakfast with some interesting people watching and good service, but overall not good enough to return to.",

I ordered at the counter, $10.00 for a bagel sandwich and fries seemed a bit high price. There are no lunch specials or combos. I ordered the roast beef on a jalapeno bagel ( They call this a jalapeno bagel.... Are you kidding me?) food was meh. There is also a bar in back where you can order drinks. At a bagel shop? This place is just going in way too many directions for me.  I don't recommend this place at all. Gave it 2 stars instead of one simply cause the food wasn't all that bad.",

    "text": "Yes.  Hell yes.  Now, THIS is what I'm talking about.  When I walked in and was greeted by a case with three fish starting back up at me I knew this would be good.  The case also contained many salads and cream cheeses and was accompanied with a sister case with b/w cookies, rugelach, and other assorted yummies.  Behind me was a refrigerated case stocked with not one, not two, but 6 flavors of Snapple!  AND every flavor of Dr. Browns including Cel-ray.  Had I died and gone back to NY?  If the heavenly smell of baked bagels was any indication I indeed had found my way to heaven.  The egg and cheese sandwich my husband ordered was insane.  INSANE.  Full of egg, cheese and grease.  My bagel and cream cheese, although not well toasted, was well cream cheesed and cut into fours.  The bagels were good, not outstanding, but I think with a little more toasting they would have been quite good.    They serve everything a bagel shop should.  Whitefish salad, bagels in real flavors not things like Dutch Apple or Asiago Parmesan (or whatever stupid flavors people want their bagels in these days...) and best of all, they serve tongue.  My good friend Dorian G. would be so happy to know that and I will definitely be taking her here when she visits.  Any good Jewish establishment will have this one key menu item.    So I tip my hat to you NY Bagels 'n Bialys.  You have proven my theory wrong that places with \"New York\" in the name usually suck.  Good job.",

I lived in Huntington, Long Island.  My favorite ritual was on Sunday's (in good weather) to grab a New York Times, bagels and cauwfee and spend my morning on the beach.  I wasn't sad to leave Longgggg Island, but I do miss my favorite Bagel shop on Walt Whitman Highway.  (And, by the way, to this day, I still have  bagels shipped to me from H & H Bagels in Manhattan.  Drop me a line and I'll give you the Web address or Google them)  The bagels from New York Bagels 'n Bialys have the right consistency - not too doughy - not too thick.     I say BOO HISS to Chompies and Einstein Bagels.    The bagels from New York Bagels 'n Bialys just might be good enough for me to want to create a new Sunday ritual.  The store ain't no beach, but a New York Times and one of these bagel might be all I need to recreate the experience (and I can always play a Brookstone CD of sea waves crashing).",

Either way, I always missed eating at my favorite Jewish deli in Tempe, Chompies, once I graduated from ASU and left the area (I actually lived right across the street from Chompies my junior year). Now and then I'd wander into an Einstein Bagels and bring a mediocre chain-store end to my craving for the day. But it was never really satisfied.  Until, that is, along came New York Bagels, located a whopping 2 minutes from my office. Thank you, Yelpers Kristin and MJ. And thank you MJ especially for educating me on the caloric difference between a bagel and a bialy. Today I opted for the latter with lox and capers and tomato and onions and.... mmm, heaven. I ate it comfortably at a table while reading a community newspaper and educating myself on the unsurprisingly anti-Semitic practices of the Soviet Union post-World War II. The Jewish guy within my multicultural personality disorder is back in business, and he's happy. Toda!",

There's a sign on Shea but otherwise the store's not visible from the street.  We drove under the arches of Agua Caliente Shopping Center and eventually found NYBnB on the right.  We were surprised by how big the place was.  We ordered an Everything bagel toasted with cream cheese ($2.39) and agree with Kristin that it would've been better more toasted.  I also prefer mine chewier.  They were more than generous with the cream cheese.  I wish you could pay only for the amount of cream cheese you want.   On our way out, we bought a half-dozen bag of mini bagels and learned that bialys are, unlike bagels, not boiled so the texture's lighter and lower in calories.    To me, a good crusty, chewy bagel's worth the calories!",

The last several visits, some bagels had the texture of not being boiled before they were baked. The taste is now hit-or-miss, as well. The other day I was in the store and didn't recognize a single employee. If they're having new people make the bagels, they need to stop now. Several bialys were undercooked and odd-tasting and, again, a few bagels were off in their texture, as well as taste.  It's bad enough that business seems to have been non-existent since the move to the new location, you can't afford to screw up your main selling point.  I just can't recommend this place anymore for bagels.",

They didn't have the bagel I wanted so I tried their cranberry bagel and it was just very chewy and bland (I didn't even taste any cranberry at all... It was just like I was eating a day-old, pink bagel). The cream cheese didn't taste very  fresh either.

Hidden in the back of a strip mall and larger and nicer inside than it appears from the outside.  Don't let the name or location dissuade you.   Started as a bagel shop supplying over 6,000 bagels per day to local resalers and then opened (I would call it) a diner serving bfast and lunch here in 2005.   Great food and friendly service. Prices are reasonable. Open until about 3pm depending on the day. Some get Yelp specials as well. Patty works the weekends and was a great server.   Check it out!",

This place surpassed all of our expectations.  To top it off my wife loves their Sunflower bagels and when I went yesterday to purchase a dozen to surprise her there were only 4 left. The lady behind the counter said if you want a dozen we will make fresh for you  Just come back in 20 to 30 minutes.I came back in 30 minutes and they were in a bag with 6 extras because Wed you buy a dozen you get 6 free.  I could not believe this kind of service still exists.  If you want a great bagel this is the place. Sincerely Roger and Jane",

They're the next closest thing to Forest Hills, or Brooklyn bagels then being there. Our former go to place was Brooklyn Bagels near Desert Ridge  Sadly, they closed about nine months ago.  Great place, too bad.  We have tried a few of the other places, but weren't as happy.  So, I type \"Bagels\" into my Yelp Search.  Poof, out came NY Bagel 'N Bialys!  What's more, I noticed there was a Yelp-on Coupon tie in.  Nice!  If I may suggest:   * 1st Thing-- Buy the Yelp-on Coupon for (was $15.00 for $25.00) now $10.00 for  $20.00 of food!  Even a better deal!   * 2nd Thing--Check-in on Yelp and get a free bagel w/cream cheese smear!     * 3rd Thing-- Sit back and wonder why you've never came here before!  D'oh!!!  We cannot wait to come back for the macaroons during the Holidays!  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Deliciousness - 4/5 Happiness - 4/5  I am a native east coaster and most of my relatives live in New York and New Jersey, aka, the world's bagel capital. Needless to say, I have spent much of my life devouring great, fantastic, or stupendous bagels. Outside of New York and New Jersey, I have never had a better bagel than at New York Bagels 'N Bialys.   I had high hopes once I saw them marketing bialys. If you have never had a bialy, I strongly urge you to do so. They are delicious and essentially, a more healthy version of a bagel (look it up - less sugar, no boiling, less flour). And boy did they not disappoint. the bagels are flavorful and covered in just the right amount of toppings (seeds/garlic/onion or whatever you like). The pumpernickel is my favorite on the bagel side. The bialys are top-notch as well - with an \"everything\" bialy being the best.   The service also reminds me of New York - for better or worse (I take that to be for the better). Don't be shy when you enter - walk right up to the counter and you will be served ASAP.  The best non-bagel item is the hopple-popple. It is a mixture of eggs, chunks of beef salami, and onions and peppers. It is a hearty and utterly delicious breakfast. The deli sandwiches are fine, but I'd personally stick with the breakfast side of the menu where everything is virtually exceptional. Also, there is no better place to find a variety of smoked fish than here.   My only complaint? The price. I feel like the price constantly goes up and a meal for two can easily get into $30-40, which is expensive for breakfast. I would go there more often if it wasn't such a hit to the bank account. Still, the quality is there, so I am willing to pay the higher price, especially for special occasions. Also, they are very good about offering deals through Yelp or other deal sites, so you can typically find something to mitigate the price. But the important thing is to just sit back and enjoy!",

    "text": "This place reminds me of a mullet. Business in the front, and party in the back.   In front, this place has all the characteristics of a hardworking, economically priced and noteworthy bagel/bialy business.  But in the back, they have a full-blown, totally stacked, BAR! Party time, baby!  New York Bagels 'N Bialys cracks me up. For the life of me, I will never understand this place. NYBB is an eerie combination of bagels and booze. Totally random and off the wall - just like my personality, and probably why I enjoy this place. I know it's hard, but try not to judge this book by its cover.  Their bagels and bialys are my favorite circular delights in the valley. I'd never even heard of a bialy until Matt and I randomly stumbled upon this spot one hung over morning. I came to realize that bialys are awesome! Instead of getting boiled before being baked like a bagel, a bialy skips the boiling part and just gets baked. Their bialys come in almost all the same flavors as their bagels.  NYBB does breakfast and brunch really well. When I used to live in the 85254, I came here almost every weekend. First of all, they make really great nonfat lattes, mimosas and road rash bloody marys. The coffee is around $2-3 depending on what espresso drink you desire, and it's cheaper/tastier than Starbucks.   From the breakfast/brunch menu, my favorite dish is the veggie omelet but all the omelets are pretty delish. They have every ingredient combination imaginable, you can sub egg whites, and you get the following sides: a bagel or bialy and cream cheese, in addition to your choice of home fries (greasy deliciousness), cottage cheese, french fries, tomatoes or a potato pancake.  I also recommend the house breakfast specials. The bagel with nova lox is to die for and the breakfast burrito is filling but it won't make you feel like an oinker. They also have egg bagels with cheese & bacon, sausage or ham! Oink Oink!  I've never been here specifically for lunch or dinner but I have tried a pizza bagel from their lunch menu for brunch. They start at $3.49, and then you can add on your own toppings for 50 cents each! No pre-made garbage here my friends, just deliciousness.   As a note, I'm only rating this place of breakfast/brunch and happy hour but FYI, they've got: sandwiches, salads, regular pizzas, nachos, quesadillas, chopped liver & bagels, potatoes and gravy, macaroni & cheese, desserts made from scratch, soups, smoked fish, burgers... oh, and they also cater.   Basically, they try to accomplish too much with just one restaurant. Food wise, your best bet is to stick to the bagels, breakfast menu and pizza bagel (the desserts look good too).  Then... after you finish business as usual for breakfast... you can come back!! Not only does this place change its name to the Rush Cafe in the evening but they also get the party started with $1.50 domestics from 4-7pm during their happy hour!!! Your buzz will be buzzing with wine, champagne, premium spirits and cocktails. Whatever your little heart desires!  NYBB is one of the cheapest breakfast spots I've found. The wait staff ensemble does consist of a crazy cast of characters (they are all a little \"different\") but they provide excellent service. Everyone here enjoys engaging customers in conversation.  Therefore, instead of giving yourself a mullet (if you do please send pictures), just come here! At NYBB you get business in the front and party in the back, without having to cut your hair.",

Anyway, this place ain't it. As pathetic as it sounds, I still can't find anything better than Chompies, and that's a pretty low bar to cross.   My wife and I took 4 of our 5 kids (oldest at UofA) and we were hopeful for a taste of NYC as we had been here for breakfast once before and it was decent. Our lunch experience was far from it.   I had the special - a skirt steak sandwich. My wife had a half chopped liver sandwich and a cup of soup (can't recall which one). Kids had bagels.   Portions were ridiculously small. There were 4 strips of steak on my bread. My wife had an ice cream scoop of chopped liver. Bagels were large, but nothing special. Service was prompt, but devoid of personality. Come on, if you're gonna work at a deli at least give me a little attitude!   Anyway, if you're Jonesing for deli, avoid this place. It won't help.",

    "text": "Just great!! I loved it. The spinach salad had so many walnuts and craisins and the raspberry vinaigrette was bomb!! We also shared the ruben which was spot on!! Nice, lean pastrami, crispy kraut and russian. They dont have sourdough so the guy behind the counter suggested marble rye and some house mustard. Man, was that great!! The fries were crispy and hot....eve. though we got our stuff to go. The matzo ball soup had fantastic flavor but I didn't like the chicken. (Nothing wrong with it, I prefer white meat and it was chewy dark) . The guy behind the counter was extremely helpful and nice. I think he's the owners son because a girl came in for an interview and he called his mom right then so I'm assuming but either way...he was knowledgeable, friendly and kind to the rest of the staff, even speaking to them in Spanish. I loved it and I'll have to make up a reason to go back to north Scottsdale! Thanks!",

Was disappointed bc I called ahead and gave very specific directions (Please make sure the 3 dozen bialy's are in plastic bags bc I need to pack them in my suitcase.  Unfortunately, they were not and I had to make the taxi wait...  costing me more money.  UGH!  In the long run, it ended up costing $72 for 39 bialys (including taxi)",

    "text": "I was really happy with my meal. The service was wonderful. I had a gift card so I ordered a few items to sample.  Ruben sandwich....great sandwich.  Nothing wrong with it. Nothing exceptional about it either though. Matzo ball soup.... really good and the noodles tasted like butter which was really something special.  Bagels and bialys.....now I really don't want to take anything away from them here because based on other people's reviews there is a big difference between a bagel you get at Einstein Bros and a legit NY bagel.....personally, I haven't met a fresh bagel I didn't like and without having the competition right next to it for the sake of comparison....I can't tell the difference. It was a good bagel and the strawberry cream cheese was homemade which was unique and delicious. I'd never heard of a bialy which is similar to a bagel except it's not boiled like a bagel,  doesn't have a hole,  and is slimmer. I didn't care for the taste or texture of the bialy. It was salty and it was cinnamon raisin. I cut it in half, the top half was light and fluffy and the bottom was so tough I could barely bite off a knock to gnaw on. If I lived close to it, I'd go there for lunch or breakfast often to support a local mom n pop, but it wasn't so great that I'd cheat on the local businesses here in Gilbert and drive to Scottsdale to visit them.",

In my opinion New York Bagels 'N Bialys have the best bagels and bialys in town! We have lived in Scottsdale for over 29 years. My husband and  I have tried many, many other places before discovering this deli. Being from the east coast, we can say the bagels and bialys are most like you would find in New York. The service has always been great. Very courteous staff who act appreciative of our business.",

Plus, even though they are boiled here, these are not good bagels at all,  even if the rye seeds were not present. Other issue is the bagel bins are far away from customers eyes - what are hiding - put the bins up front like every True NY bagel shop. Hey, if your gonna call yourself a NY bagel place (yes I am from NY) then I want the whole experience. Charging $11 for a turkey sandwich is a bit much too and this is an unfriendly, cold location with no charm. There was a very hairy bird outside though looking for crumbs and on this day that bird got lucky. Onto the next place.",

If you're having a party get their bialy stick sandwich tray.  You can custom order it the way you want with the side dishes to go with it.  YUM!  I finally won my husband over with their burgers, which I would never order, when I can get their small roast beef sandwich on a wheat bialy stick.  He also loves their hopple popple for breakfast.
