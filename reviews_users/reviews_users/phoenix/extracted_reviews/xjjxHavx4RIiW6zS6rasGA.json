We were shown to a table in what looked like a back room - the table was not set, there was just a tablecloth and that was it.  The room is to the right as you walk in.  There were only 2 other tables in there and the windows were covered (no view) - it was weird so I immediately asked to be seated in the main part of the restaurant.  Decor seemed 'cheap' - just my initial impression.  Food was pretty good.  Pancetta wrapped shrimp app was good; Service was good.  Entrees were pretty good - Chicken Parm, Fettucine Bolognese all tasty, but not sure I would go back.  Caesar salad was a bit disappointing...asked for anchovies on the side - never delivered.",

Service was a little awkward - friendly enough, but amateur. The waiter brought one diner's salad before her side dish, though she clearly ordered them together. Then it was a lengthy wait before anything else came out. This is but one example of things feeling a little off.  Worst of all, something very bad had happened in the ladies' room that we felt compelled to inform management about. So maybe I just was suffering from a lost appetite.  Fine, but I expected more.",

    "text": "My Aunt and Uncle were in town and I was tasked by my Mom to find a great place to eat. My Uncle always picks up the check so the price had to be modest but the service and food had to be excellent and at the last minute Mom threw in \"oh, and we want to eat outside.\" I looked for quite a while at reviews of places, I narrowed my search to the $$ places and Tommy V's stood out as one of the top ones in Scottsdale, I searched for outdoor seating and again of that list Tommy V's stood out. I didn't see any pictures of outdoor seating on Yelp (hint hint Mr. cool owner guy who I know is reading this) so I called to make sure they did have the outdoor seating and made a reservations for the 6 of us.   My first impression was a great one, I would describe the decor as clean and classy. No clutter, just a perfectly lit, perfectly decorated modern spot with the music to go with it.   I don't remember what everyone got but two of us got that Lobster Bisque which was super fantastic, and two of us got the \"Manila Clams Linguine\" which is by far the best seafood pasta dish that I have ever had, loaded with clams. A few of us got the \"Grilled Shrimp Risotto,\" and they made my mom something that wasn't on the menu at her request  The service was excellent and our server did a great job suggesting the right wine for each person on the group. Well other than me because I am more of whiskey kind of guy.   We all had a fantastic time, everything we ordered was excellent and the added touch of the owner coming out to see how everything was makes this place an easy 5 stars and a place I would without reservation recommend to anyone.   Oh,.. the other thing I noticed when I was doing my research was the consistency of positive customer experiences. A lot of top reviewed places in Scottsdale seem to be hot or cold depending on your server or the night you go. Tommy V's seems to have a formula for getting it right all the time.",

Service was excellent and attentive.  Angel was our waiter.    There were three of us.  We had the fried calamari, baby beet salad, grilled shrimp risotto, orechiette with lobster and shrimp and the short ribs with spinach gnocchi.  All the dishes were excellently prepared and flavorful.  The fried calamari reminded me of the way my mother makes them.  Perfectly cooked and a very light batter.  Salad was delicious with just right amount of dressing.   Risotto was well prepared with great flavor from the shrimp and hint of lemon.   The orechiette was prepared al dente with a light red sauce infused with the lobster and shrimp.  Yummy! The short ribs were melt in your mouth tender with gnocchi that were very light in texture.  Will definitely return to try other dishes.",

I don't know if I should thank you or curse you,  I am supposed to still be on my Hcg diet, so I was not having anything.  However, my hubby decided he was doing the Restaurant Week dinner.  It looked amazing, so I took a little bite of his beet salad, ohh, perfectly roasted golden and red beets with arugula and goat cheese.  Then he had the Eggplant Torta, OMG, it reminded me of the Melanzana (italian for the Eggplant Torta) my daddy and I used to make on Sundays, I had three bites.  Then it came the Lemon Torte, my willpower caved and I had to have two bites.  I guess I will have to go on the treadmill a little longer this week.  Michael behind the bar was fantastic.  I had a taste of a few wines before settling for the Heavyweight Cabernet.  Zoran, stopped by to say hello, we have something in common, he also has twins.

The complimentary bread and oil/vinegar dip was very good, crusty on the outside while warm and soft on the inside. We got the smoked salmon bruschetta and the bacon cheese burger off the happy hour menu.  The salmon tasted like it was food quality and freshly smoked, however it was very salty. The olives were  even saltier. Towards the end of the platter, even sharing between two people, the dish was hard to enjoy. We even started picking off the olives and eating a lot of the garnish greens on the plate to help.  The burger looked great, served on ciabatta bread with the perfect amount and slice thickness of tomato and onion.  The only complaint I had was that my medium burger was a bit extra charred on parts of the outside and the bread was burned in one corner.  So about a quarter of the burger tasted like a brick of coal.  We ordered tiramisu for dessert. It was actually pretty good and well portioned.  Of course it was $7 so it ought to be!  All in all, i'm not sure I'd be too excited about going back. I might go one more time to try a pasta dish, maybe that's their specialty?  I was a little disappointed because the reviews were so great and the food looked delicious upon presentation. The prices don't allow for much room less than perfection.",

The menu is pretty large, and after getting over the initial disappointment that they were out of the item I had picked out, I settled on the shrimp risotto.  It was a really nice dish, although it wasn't quite so much of a risotto as some deliciously seasoned and grilled jumbo shrimp atop a bed of savory herbed rice with lemon (it was long grain, not arborio, and wasn't creamy enough to be risotto).  Also of note here: the wine list!  Extremely impressive selection, and reasonably priced, with a ton of good values.  The calamari is solid as well.",

    "text": "First off, I have to say that I didn't eat here during this visit, so this review is strictly regarding the atmosphere, impressions of the menu, and the bar at 7pm on a Saturday night. It was pouring down rain on the Saturday night I entered Tommy V's Urban Kitchen from the awkwardly situated Indian school road entrance.  I walked directly into the dining room adjacent to the bar from what appears - from a pedestrian perspective, to be the main entrance. No one at the very sparely populated bar, or the less than half full dining room, seemed to notice my arrival - including the abundant wait staff or bartender.  My first impression was that the establishment is nicely appointed, and makes a good attempt at an urban upscale feeling.  The menu however, seemed to be somewhat unsurprising and full of what I've come to regard as tired old scottsdale standards. There's mussels, and gnocchi, and steaks oh my! As I glanced at the massive, bound text that were eventually laid out before me on the bar by the nearly mute bartender;  I noted that the prices seemed rather inflated. Everything seemed closer to the $$$ range, than the $$ listed on Yelp.  Perhaps the prices are designed to support the over abundance of staff - I counted four bus boys, three waiters and a hostess just milling around, and reinforce the idea that this is \"upscale dining\"?   The bartender had as much personality as the bowl of corks on the bar (corks in a bowl, 2005 called to say you're out of date...) and though I'm no spring chicken, I'm sure I was way more than three standard deviations below the average age I observed on this particular Saturday night. I have to say, They do make a good manhattan, but it's delivered without the slightest bit of soul, and the clientele felt more like retirement home than 7pm on a Saturday night. The food may be wonderful, but I'm skeptical just based on the menu and Saturday night \"dinner rush\" crowd that has any dining room less than a quarter full. All that being said, I'll give it another shot and try the food, more based on the plethora of positive reviews and vicinity to my typical dinner out location(s) than anything else.  Hey, maybe i'm wrong - i doubt it, but it could happen.  However, on first impression, this place looks perfect if you are looking for a  \"fancy-looking place\" that isn't too busy on a Saturday night.  The kind of non-chain establishment place where your slightly upscale parents will feel comfortable, and maybe they'll think you've actually become an adult when you pick up that tab.",

The short ribs were not as tender as I'd like but it was good for the price ($13). My colleague had the pan seared salmon which looked really good.  Hard to go wrong with pan seared salmon unless you overcook it.",

This is a pleasant restaurant done in neutral colors with old photos of celebrities on the walls. Good wine list and a full bar plus a fairly short menu with a good variety.   Since I was eating alone, I started with a decent Malbec ($9). Service was prompt and attentive at the busy bar. I keep a strict paleo diet and that limited my choices, but I was tempted by some of the delicious sounding choices.  I ordered the short ribs. The menu says they come with gnocchi and spinach. I asked to replace the gnocchi with vegetables which was done with no problems. My meal appeared in a reasonable time and was beautifully presented.  There were two good-sized, boneless short ribs with perfectly cooked and presented mixed vegetables. I soul have taken a photo! The meat was fork-tender and absolutely delicious! The mixed broccoli, cauliflower and carrots were a perfect accompaniment.   With wine and tax the bill was just over $33 and worth every penny.  I would certainly return.",

    "text": "Update note: On 5/24/2016 we revisited Tommy V's and it was great once again except the lamb chops, which had an off flavor and consistency.  This is a real puzzle considering the quality of everything else.  Perhaps this is not their best item.  I am getting pretty selective as to where I bestow five stars, and Tommy V's did not have that Wow! factor that I usually want to see.  But it got straight A's in almost everything else.  Located in downtown Scottsdale, Tommy V's is a modern space with not much of an Italian look.  But it is bright, clean, not too noisy, comfortable and has a pretty good view for an \"urban\" kitchen.  The service was perfect -- quick, friendly, but not overbearing.  Everything we ate was at least pretty good, and the Pappardelle and the Cannoli were excellent.  But without anything to make you jump up and down with glee, Tommy V's also had to score well on value to justify the top rating.  And it did.  For the area (note qualification), it is quite reasonably priced, including even the drinks.  HINT:  I hear it has a great happy hour, but we missed that.  HINT:  Parking may be a bit tough in season on weekends.",

I'm not into rating a place amazing based on how cool or \"hip\" it is. I'm 27, my BF 43...we like good food but don't have ridiculously high expectations either. I convinced my BF to come here after reading the reviews. He had the Tommy's Amazing Pasta Trio and I had the chicken piccata. The food was honestly a little above that of a frozen dinner. The trio was bland and not very flavorable. My piccata was paired with a red pasta ziti and a steamed vegetable medley. The lemon sauce seemed like it was made from a gravy packet...  It wasn't HORRIBLE, but it wasn't great it was average, with a price tag. Not that price is an issue, but our meal was $100 with tip and we left feeling let down...my sparkling wine was the highlight of my dinner sadly. Also, they do not carry coors or miller light...but they carry budlight.   We also had the steamed mussels for an app...we usually get steamed clams, but those weren't on the menu. We aren't huge fans for fishy flavor, and these tasted like eating a bite of ocean water...not sure if that's how mussels are suppose to be or not.  Anyway that's our experience and take...I wouldn't go back sadly...",

We came here yesterday and were pleasantly surprised to see that happy hour is from 11-6:30. The weather was incredible so we sat outside in their beautiful courtyard. The decor is modern contemporary, and they play soft pop/R&B from the 90s and 2000s, which is kind of mellow in an unpretentious way. We had a really sweet waitress who made sure that our experience was very smooth.  Onto the best part - the food --- When the bread is incredible, it's just such a good sign! The balsamic vinagrette with the oil is really excellent quality. I almost asked them where they get it, because we've been having trouble finding good balsamic out here. After the bread, we had Mini Ciabatta Sliders, which come with ricotta, basil, asiago, EVOO, and fig jam that is to die for! Then I ordered the Grilled Cheese and Short Rib sandwich, which came pressed with arugula, caramelized onions, manchego & cheddar. Again, AMAZING. My husband ordered the Bistro Tender & Panzanella Salad, which is served with grilled beef tenderloin, organic tomatoes, red onions, olives, romaine, croutons, and drizzled with balsamic reduction. He took a bite and was like \"Wow, this is REALLY good!\"  I cant stress enough how good the food is! The fresh ingredients, delicious flavor profiles, unique combinations... it really feels like the person who is making your food cares deeply for it, and it makes a big difference!  I will definitely be back!",

We called at 6:30 on a Saturday night and asked if we could be seated if we were arriving in 20 minutes.  Tommy answered the phone and told us that with Barrett Jackson and the Rock n Roll marathon in town it was doubtful, but we could most likely sit at the bar. He however took our name anyway. When we arrived, and gave him our name, he greeted us with a smile and took us straight to our table. From there, Kevin took excellent care of us, accommodating all of our special requests with a smile. The food was excellent. I had a wonderful spinach salad (which was not on the menu, but Kevin didn't even blink at my request) And chicken piccata. Both were unique and delicious. My husband had a Tuscan pork chop with spicy spaghetti. It was the best Pork chop he has ever had. We will most definitely visit Tommy V's again in the future.",

After walking by the establishment nearly 10 times, we finally stopped to check out the menu on our last day in town. What?! An Italian restaurant just steps away from us the entire trip? We instantly knew what we were having for dinner that night and booked a reservation right then and there.   The restaurant itself is very pretty. It's sleek and modern with a large outdoor patio and floor-to-ceiling windows to enjoy the view from every seat inside. Tommy V's takes pride in their service, food, and fine wines.   My husband's favorite Italian dish is chicken parmesan, so it was a no brainer that he wanted it the moment he saw it listed on the menu. His entree came with a side of pasta and a vegetable medley. It was good, but mine was better. ;) Upon recommendation from our server, I went with the chilean sea bass. It was topped with a light lemon wine sauce and served with roasted potatoes and sauteed spinach. I'm so glad I listened to our smart server and got this! Now it's your turn to take MY suggestion and order this dish the next time you visit Tommy V's. You'll thank me later...",

The place has a cool look and our server was nice.   Negative 1 - there was absolutely no hot tea selection and the server had no idea what tea they had. I usually never get tea but decided to this time. The tea was some cheap brand and was presented completely unorganized.  Negative 2 - the chop salad is not chopped and its more like a side salad on a large plate. Negative 3 - the beat salad was more of a greens salad with some sorry looking off colored beets on the side. The salad tasted like one big bite.  Negative 4 - the meat and cheese plate that says a selection of such is not so. We received to thin slices of salume and two thin slices of prosciutto. The cheese was cheese sticks and the majority of the plate was veggies. The artichokes were the best on the plate.  Negative 5 - the so called house made pasta is either not house made or the cooks in back do not know how to cook pasta. We got risotto with shrimp and the shrimp was so over cooked that is was inedible.  Then we got the trio of pastas. Tasted like generic microwaved pasta. And was like mush. We didn't finish either plate.  Negative 6 - we didn't want to attempt dessert and i wanted it!!!  This place lacks any food luster. We were so disappointed and bummed. We couldn't figure out how we spent $90. I suggest, if you must go to just go to the bar.  I gave them one star because of the artichokes and our water glasses were never empty.   In conclusion, this place is just not good.",

    "text": "I'm wrestling between 3 and 4 stars, but they had a live band playing Frank Sinatra and that's just damn romantical [yes I know I made that word up], so it gets 4.   I loved the ambiance. Low lighting, not too loud/obnoxious (aside from what appeared to be a birthday party at a nearby table). It actually wasn't as terribly busy as I would've expected for a Friday night. Perfect for a late Valentine's dinner with the boy.   The waitstaff was VERY friendly and attentive-almost too attentive. I know everyone has their preferences, but I'd prefer that the waiter not be at my table every 5 minutes. I know he was trying to be helpful in helping us decide what to order as we'd never been there before. Also, it seemed like every time I took a few sips of water, someone was coming by to top off my glass. I guess that's better than the waitstaff completely forgetting you and you feel as if you might die from dehydration. That might be a little dramatic but you know what I mean.   For drinks, we ordered what I think was called the Urban Manhattan? It was certainly a Manhattan but I can't remember if that's the correct drink name. I don't typically order this drink-but it was quite delicious.  Onwards to the food! After going back and forth between the Amazing Pasta Trio and Eggplant Torta & Butternut Squash Ravioli, I went with the trio..because HEY! It says it's amazing. In the back of my head I was thinking, \"that could be an over hyped claim\". My boyfriend ordered the Bucatini Amatriciana. Our server complimented on us on our outstanding choices..they really do talk up their menu items as other's have noted.  Our food arrived rather quickly. Portion size was little to be desired. I wasn't starving but.... seriously. The amount of food did not justify the price. It was delicious, don't get me wrong! I've eaten at enough upscale prices that you're not going to get a lot because you're getting quality food. I just felt as though it would be best listed as a \"small plate\".  It was some of the best pasta I've ever eaten, so I have to give credit where it is due. Boyfriend's Bucatini Amatriciana appeared to have a lot more to it and he said it was quite delicious-although he did feel bad for me with what little amount of food I had received. Too bad it had bacon in it, or I would've had some of his for myself.   Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience. Great waitstaff and delicious food despite the few issues I had with the place. I would go back again! I'm a pasta junkie!",

I don't usually eat out at Italian restaurants but was pretty impressed with the food here. Seafood risotto was the winner of the night. Plenty of different seafood pieces in every bite and the risotto was cooked just right.  The pasta trio is also very good, with the mushroom one being my favorite and gnocchi a close second. I also shared a caprese salad that was good but nothing to write home about. I'd probably pass on that and try something else next time.  They have a decent wine list with varying price points that will accommodate your tastes and budget. The entrees, while not inexpensive, were reasonably priced for a nice dinner and atmosphere in Scottsdale.  The only downside was that our pasta plate was brought out cold. They quickly took it back and made a new one without complaints, so that was appreciated.   The menu is varied but not overwhelmingly extensive. I'll be back to try other items they offer.",

The second star is because of the cream of potato soup which was actually amazing but also one of the cheapest things on the menu.   The gentlemen that took care of us were great. Regardless of the beautiful atmosphere, I'd say this restaurant is mostly show and not much else. The Cheesecake Factory is even better than this.",

We called and were able to get a reservation before the main rush of customers (5:30 ish)  The server we had was super nice and attentive. The food was great, we (as a group) had a steak entree, spaghetti, and brown butter ravioli along with appetizers and desserts and everything we had tasted great. The atmosphere was really nice and the old school vintage vibe was refreshing.  Overall we were super happy that we picked this place to eat (and we mainly picked it since it had such good and positive yelp reviews, despite initial confusion over if it was an italian restaurant or an 'urban one' it seemed italian over urban).",

We were here for a late lunch and the place was not very crowded, we got the table in the corner overlooking the street.The bartender came to get our order for drinks and we asked what premium scotch do they have ? To our horror he pointed his finger in the direction of the bar and asked us to choose.Just to be clear we were not seated at the bar and we had to strain our eyes to read the labels on the bottle.  The server who came to get our lunch order was a grumpy man who was probably having a bad day. We ordered Hazelnut Risotto (Mushrooms, Shallots, Truffle &Toasted Hazelnuts). portobello Mushroom sandwich (Roasted Red Peppers, Tomato, Caramelized Onions, Herb Mayo,Basil Pesto and goat Cheese Served with house Salad).  The food was just average nothing exciting also it was quite annoying as the same guy started setting other tables next to ours for dinner service, dropping silverware without any apologies.My Limoncello martini was good which i spilled just before getting the check(that was the only time he did smile). In totality this was anything but a Pleasant Experience.  Cheers!",

Appetizer of prosciutto and mozzarella on toast was uninspired. Special for the night of pork osso buco was decently tender, but underwhelming in favor. Special pasta of the night was shortrib and ricotta, wife barely touched it. Patio area was very nice. Service was good too. I will look elsewhere for Italian when I'm next in town though.",

I had the rigatoni with Italian sausage while others had everything from the chicken cobb salad the short rib sandwich to the burger. Everyone was raving about their food, as was I.  The atmosphere was very nice as well and they even have live jazz on Friday and Saturday nights which I would like to return and see.

I mean, it was our 2nd Annual Romantic NYE Dinner of sorts, coupled with attending the Phoenix Symphony.  Oh man, where to start, I really wanted a Vesper, but Tommy Vs bar didn't have Lillet Blanc on hand which is saddening.  But my waitress knew about James Bond drinking his martinis with Gin and Vodka together, so that was a plus in her fanhood!.  I ordered the house cabernet and called it good there.  My Four Course choices were:  Caprese Salad, Chicken Pesto Ravioli, Osso Buco, Chocolate Mousse.  The lady chose:  The Pear Salad, Crab Cakes, Lobster Risotto, Caramel Sorbetto.  I cannot even tell you how divine every course was...words do not confer that!  It was delicious!  I do wish the Lobster Risotto was spicy, I know Tommy's is not a Cajun place but it would have just taken that dish over the fence for my palate. And for that price...I should have just taken half of the mains home, but I would not for we chose to travel afoot.  (Our main dishes were giants on a plate, the waitress stated the Osso Buco was huge, but I think by volume the Lobster Risotto won the competition handily.)  Our waitress whose name I did not commit to memory was wonderful, had some humor about the evening and was there at the right time of every course.  The busser cleared plates fast and our waters never ceased to be full.",

We observed some items on yelp photos that were not on the menu. When we asked about one item the waitress went to ask and never gave us an answer.  My wife was told the chicken rigatoni white wine dish she got came with a creamy white wine sauce. The dish did not appear to have any sauce especially not any creamy sauce and was very bland. I tried the chicken and agreed that it was just bland meat with no flavor. She was very disappointed.   I got the chicken parmesan and thought it was pretty good. The cheese was not melted all the way. It only came with one piece of chicken for $21 which was surprising. The tiramisu was good, but not amazing. Overall, we would not go back. Seems like a restaurant being pulled in too many culinary directions from Italian to seafood to steakhouse. This is a restaurant that tries to master all, ends up being a master of none.",

The food was delicious. I was in the mood for some comfort food, so I ordered the caesar salad and Tommy's Amazing Homemade Pasta Trio. I ate every last bite. The gnocchi melts in your mouth, the ravioli was wonderful and the tortelli was delicious as well (even for somebody that isn't a huge mushroom fan). The server seemed to disappear quite often and hardly came to check on us. At one point, he came over and asked if we were finished. We were clearly not and my wine glass was empty and he hadn't even asked if I wanted another. I would consider giving this place another chance since I had a good experience with my meal.",

How good can it be I thought, it looks so boring.  Boy was I wrong, my guy and I went for dinner happy hour and filled up on delicious crostini and I have to tell you one of the best spaghetti bolognese bowls I have ever had.  Totally unexpected, the meaty sauce was perfectly seasoned, rich and flavorful and oh so comforting.  A basic done to the highest degree.  A surprise I fell in love with and thought about days after.  Thank you Tommy's Vs, I look forward to coming back and exploring the rest of your menu if I can tear myself away from that heavenly bolognese. :)",

    "text": "So this week we find ourselves at Tommy V's Urban Kitchen for a classy-upscale Happy Hour and just for the occasion we even dressed up! Did I mention we have a great looking crew! Tommy V's took great care of us and started us out right with a few bottles of wine on the table, they know the way to our hearts! But that doesn't mean we are easy, nope!  The Crostino Di Prosciutto, Toasted Bread capped with prosciutto & melted mozzarela sprinkled with fresh sage was simply delish! A big fan of prosciutto, this definitely didn't disappoint and almost resulted in a fork to a hand as the crew fought over the last piece.  Another favorite was the Mozzarella Caprese,  which features Fresh Mozzarella, Vine-Ripened Tomatoes, Basil, and an Extra Virgin Olive Oil Drizzle. It is a perfect compliment to a glass of wine, or two, and is definitely a good choice for the summer! I know it's hard to eat when it's over 100 but not having to give up taste, makes it easier!

It's refreshing to go into an Italian restaurant that knows how to do it. Everything from the people, the ambiance, the decor, the food, wine selections, etc. The half booth half table seating along the wall was quite comfortable and gave us a great view of the whole place. I also had the pleasure to speak with the owner for a bit and he is a genuine kind-hearted soul who really has passion that is hard to find in people now a days (Zoran Klisara). My baby got beer, I ordered a Sangiovese and my friend a peach cocktail.  We began our culinary journey with the calamari and I enjoyed it because the sauce was fantastic and it was not too greasy or salty like some places choose to fry up their seafood. My friend ordered the bucatini amatriciana, my baby ordered the braised short ribs and I ordered veal marsala. We shared a bit of each others and they were all fantastic dishes especially mine. It is actually quite easy for one to ruin a good veal dish (chewy, rubbery, no flavor, etc). Then when it came time to satisfy our sweet tooth, my friend ordered the highly recommended Amaretto dessert and I shared the sliced chocolate ice cream with nuts and strawberries.  It was simple and flavorful... all of it... not too over the top by trying too hard. Thank you for a great culinary experience!",

First let me say that I am NOT necessarily a \"Bargain Hunter,\"  so the fact that there was a \"Happy Hour Menu\" from 11 AM on wasn't going to sway me. Also to be noted, I have only visited for Lunch.   There are however incredible bargains on the Happy Hour Menu and between friends and myself we have had almost ALL of the offerings. Several are amazing! Most notably:             ALL FOUR of the \"Very Happy Hour\" offerings are memorable             The Bistro Tenderloin & Panzanella Salad is FABULOUS!             The Risotto Carbonara is AMAZING!  If lunch is an indication, the quality here is absolutely superb and is a NOT TO BE MISSED experience!  The Service on each visit has been impeccable, with the waiter almost unbelieving that we would order so many different offerings.  Plus what is wrong with having delicious bargains for lunch?

We had the calamari and the chef's plate for apps. The plate was awesome while the calamari was average. The seafood risotto was dumbfounding as you couldn't even take a bite of the risotto without getting a piece of some sort of fish along with it - shrimp, scallops, lobster (by all means a good thing.)  The pasta trio was also very good. The mushroom ravioli was by far the star of the plate. Great place, recommended for sure.",

We had reservations for four at 6PM on a Saturday and the place was about half full.  Within an hour it was full!  That's when I noticed the noise level was rather high with laughter and conversations.  This was an attractive and fun environment.   It was my wife's birthday and several waiters and the owner congratulated her more than several times, a nice touch.  My wife ordered decaf herbal tea and 4 different kinds were brought to the table.  Much has been said about their wine list but none of us ordered any alcoholic drinks.  It was an upscale environment with white linen tablecloths and attractive silverware.   We started with appetizers, the fried calamari (not the most tender, but flavorful and a good sized portion) and crab cakes (extremely flavorful and attractive to the eye). We had Shrimp Risotto  (creamy and delicious with lots of shrimp on top),  Manila Clams Linguine Roasted Garlic, White Wine, Fresh Herb Sauce  (a good amount of clams, a few still in the shell, tasty but not wonderful, with well cooked pasta),  Chicken Piccata  (a bit overcooked, lots of capers in a tart sauce, pleasant tasting but not great, small piece of breast cutlet, with a side of penne rigate in a tomato sauce that was a bit dry and didn't have much flavor), and Seared Pacific Red Snapper, Creamy Polenta & Asparagus with Mushrooms, Red Pepper in Tomato Sauce  ( an excellent dish, pretty, tasty, good sized portion of well cooked snapper), one of our better dishes.  Next time I wouldn't order the calamari, chicken piccata, and the clam linguine.  They brought my wife a slice of what looked and tasted like French Silk Pie with a little candle in it (no charge), a nice touch.  It was delicious! We will give them another try, I would rate them between 3 1/2 and 4 stars.",

    "text": "Honestly, the worst Italian food we have ever had. The meat balls were the equivalent of a ball of spam with a marinara that tasted like it was right out of a can. The Bolognese was a salty mess, no flavors of a Bolognese at all. The beet salad, was a mound of greens with some beets tossed in with a small slice of a round of goat cheese.  I'm sorry to have to post something so negative. We had high hopes for this restaurant, but three dishes out of three that were frankly awful, I have no choice.",

I had the braised short ribs with spinach gnocchi and it was amazing! The spinach was in the center of the gnocchi, covered in a great sauce. And the short ribs were super tender and covered in a delicious gravy. My friends also really enjoyed their meals: lobster ravioli and citrus shrimp; lobster & crab ravioli. We also ordered crostini prosciutto mozzarella bread, the prosciutto was thick and it came with lots of cheese, two thumbs up!    We would have preferred to sit outside, but for some reason that wasn't an option even though half the tables were empty. I'm guessing they were short staffed. Just a small bump we ran into.   Would absolutely come again.",

Hubby and I recently visited Scottsdale for a short get away and we were staying very nearby at the lovely Hermosa Inn and didn't want to drive too far for dinner after a long day of traveling.  We were driving by and noticed Tommy V's Pizza and since the hubs loves him some pizza we decided to go in.    Normally we like to sit at the bar, but it was packed since it was a Friday night and during happy hour so we took a hightop nearby instead.  Service here was excellent.  I believe our server's name was Bob and Bob was excellent.  We received our drinks promptly and some lush bread with some type of pesto butter I believe, whatever it was it was good.  I got the Fettucine Bolognese and hubby settled on a meat pizza of some kind.  Food came out promptly and both meals very good.  The place was packed with people and the vibe was good.  I don't understand some of the negative reviews, food and service when we were here was great.",

Kind of frightening that there were only four others in the restaurant when we arrived at 4 pm and not many more by the time we left.   First thing I noticed was caked on food on my fork. Also on my son's fork. AND on my other son's forks. The waiter didn't really seem concerned other than saying something about nobody polishing that section. Uh, how about WASHING??   Because we drove across town and it being Mother's Day, it didn't seem feasible to go elsewhere, or we would have. We stuck it out and dinner was very good. We had the carpaccio and a seafood/pasta appetizer, chicken parm and chicken piccata. Nothing left on our plates. The pasta portion of each dish was skimpy, which was disappointing because we were looking forward to homemade pasta.   If we are in the area, we'll probably try it again.",

Set up a business meeting for four people at 7pm at Tommy V's without a reservation on St. Patty's day (I forgot about it, along with forgetting to wear anything green) and during Cactus league/spring training in Scottsdale, Arizona. (From bad to worse.)    What did the manager do at Tommy V's? He found me a great table on the awesome patio and was gracious about it.  Just for that wonderful accommodation alone would be enough...but hold up!  The food was excellent (the eggplant, wow!) the wine and beer selection was great (kick ass happy hour prices) and the service was outstanding (thanks Tyler.)    This was my first time here along with one of my four guests and we all really had a nice time...and don't forget it was a business meeting!  I am looking forward to going again if my experience ends up being like my last gig, it'll be worth it.",

    "text": "WOW - 18 months later Artie Bucco Jr sent me a Yelp message!   \"David S. 12 hours ago  Hi Sam, This is David, your waiter who you skewered last year at Tommy V's.I have deliberated for some time about reaching out to you. I thought your yelp was pretty unfair to me and very unfair to the restaurant. You say in your profile that you don't waste a place for 1 bad meal or \"crappy \" waiter. Well, you did! I want to remind you that I asked if you and your dad were here with The Giants, I did not look at you as \"Country Bumpkins\". You kinda made that up to villainize <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fme.At&s=91b5ca5ddef107a2271e8103bcbbcd41a461d11a2cae0a450d06485c60002d48\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">me.At</a> first I was upset over the calamari and your dad was nice about it. It was your choice to be upset. I tried to lighten up the mood with some levity and you chose to be offended. It is probably good that Yelping back at yelpers is not permitted. I have been serving over 40 years and your review was the nastiest I ever received\"  I guess this place is cool with having their servers contact Yelpers regarding reviews!   Original Review:   Wow - what is it with all the love for this place? Have None of you been tot he Italian Grotto?  Maybe this is for the snooty eaters out there - because this place was awful to us. It was 2/3 empty and we get asked if we have a reservation - No, just walk ins... so they sit us right next tot he kitchen by where the waiters come in and out - easily the worst table in the restaurant, and they weren't even busy.  So, I haven't even noticed this when we order a calamari appetizer, which was recommended by apparent not very familiar with good food blogger Jaymee Sire (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Feisforeat.blogspot.com%2F2&s=03cb60a3c0c5eeacd1251fee70eb262edca94eca573fa012a7a601d72f9db67c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eisforeat.blogspot.com/2</a>...)  I went with 2/4 of what she said to have - the chicken parm and the calamari. The calamari were terrible - I mean, what do we expect, fresh fish in Arizona must be something of an oxymoron...  So this is where things get interesting - the waiter asks us how our rubbery, tasteless calamari is - I being one who doesn't like to send food back tried to hide the truth, but the look on my dad's face was as if his only son came home to say he got an Al Qaeda male general pregnant and they weren't getting married... So the waiter grabs the plate before we can say anything to have them make another batch.. which we didn't want, and shocker, the second batch was even worse...  So at this point dad is furious, and yells at me for eating enough of the bad calamari creepy crawlers (the ones with tentacles are my favorite) so that he can't bitch at the waiter about how bad it was when he comes back.  The waiter takes away the app and comes back with the entrees - now we had ordered a pasta to share and two entrees, thinking he would brought them out for a pasta course then the main dishes - but it all came out at once. As he places the food down, Dad tells the waiter \"I've been punished before, it's OK, I get it,\" and I am part rolling my eyes part trying not to laugh.  That this waiter has looked us up and down as a couple of country bumpkins not realizing my dad is normally a 20-30% tipper, especially when on vacation with a roll of dough in his pocket. So then, to add insult to injury, this Artie Bucco wannabe comes back to check on how the entrees are then quips \"So I don't have to take these back? Enjoy!\"  Well - Self Fulfilling prophecy jerk-wad - I would be nicer to customers based on how mediocre your food was - I am a Chicken Parmesan SLUT - I ate maybe 2/3 of it. The pasta bolognese? MEH... Dad unfortunately ordered fish for his main dish, which was again NOT fresh, so he pretty much at all the rest of the pasta t the table.  I will never go back here - give me the Italian Grotto every day, where the food is better, the servers have personality, and the food is amazing - strange how THEIR calamari tastes fresh...",

The dishes on the menu sounded amazing, however, for my personal taste the food was a bit bland. I had the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccini, the seafood was cooked just right but the sauce for the fettuccini did not have much flavor.

    "text": "We just decided to try another Italian restaurant in old town Scottsdale and tonight it was Tommy V's. We got there really early around 6:30 on a Saturday and there was only about two tables occupied. Really slow we thought but we were wrong cause everyone tries to get there before 8pm cause that's when the live band performs and tonight was a jazz band.   Parking for us was really easy when you come early but after 7:30pm then forget it. It's a fairly small parking lot especially on a Saturday night.   When we walked in, it looked really modern decor. Dark brown wooden floors, white table cloths, and huge mirrors on the walls. Very chic. Nice atmosphere.   We were seated right away, greeted, and we got our drinks orders quickly. We always start off with the Fried Calamari. Our favorite. It was pretty good. Crispy and not over cooked. Tasted really good with the red sauce. They also provided bread with oil and vinegar. Bread was really good especially when you soak up that oil and vinegar.   I had the Zin Braised Short Ribs and it came with spinach gnocchi. The short ribs were very tender and were fall off goodness. They give you two fairly big pieces. Not bad. The spinach gnocchi were cooked really good. Chewy in the middle and it was pretty good. I would have to say it was a pretty good meal. Not great but good.   My wife had the Pacific Halibut and I snuck a few bites and she really enjoyed it. Pretty moist and tasted pretty good. My daughter got the Fettuccini Bolognese with a three meat sauce that came with veal, beef, & pork. She really likes it and was really raving about it. Usually she like to take some home for another meal but she liked it so much she ate it all. Enough said. Then my son got a special Shrimp & Lobster Fettuccini. Really fresh and really good. He gobbled it up and loved it. Raved about it too. So it must have been really good.   We can never forget about dessert. I got a cappuccino and cannoli. Cappuccino was very good and the cannoli was out of this world. Very creamy. Not to sweet. Really good. We shared and everyone really liked it a lot.   The service was exceptional. They took really good care of us. Filling water cups. Checking on our food and clearing out dishes in a timely manner. Really good service.   When we first got there it was really quiet with some soothing music in the background. By the end of our meal the place packed up and it became pretty loud and seemed like everyone was waiting for the band to start playing. We left before the band started playing. So I would recommend coming around 7:30 to hear the live band.   So they had exceptional service, good but not great food, great ambiance, with a pretty loud crowd. We really enjoyed our time at Tommy V's. Enjoy.",

    "text": "Tommy V's is a normal suburban restaurant Italian restaurant in every respect.    The moniker of \"Urban Kitchen\" they chose to describe themselves conveys a certain flair that was sorely missed here.   The only think 'urban' about the place is the decor color palette.   The ambiance is that of any large mid-range restaurant anywhere in the US.   It's a big place, with a lot of tables, that gets loud.    The service is capable and friendly, but not particularly gifted.  The food is well prepared and tasty but typical Italian fare.   The drinks are good but not creative.  All in all it was a positive experience; but we really wanted something special, and it wasn't.  Clearly, many people favor the restaurant as it is often quite busy, and perhaps that's the best recommendation.",

I ordered the prince edward island mussels for appetizer and the shrimp and lobster fettuccini for entree. The mussels were served in a tomatoey sauce with garlic and smoked chilli, and a side of bread. The mussels were pretty fresh, and most importantly was the tomatoey sauce! It was so good for dipping your bread in it! I almost ate the plate because the sauce was so delicious! The smoked chilli was a good complement to the mussels for those of you who enjoy some heat and spiciness to their food.  The shrimp and lobster fettuccini came in a light tomato cream sauce. Both the shrimp and lobster were fresh and not overcooked. It was a pretty delicious pasta dish.  At the end, my bill came to around $48 tip included and without drinks. I had a great experience of enjoying Italian food. My server was very attentive as well. Overall, I would come here again for special occasions knowing that I would splurge and indulge in the food here with a great experience. :)",

You won't be disappointed, everything from the atmosphere to the service, the cleanliness, and the food is excellent! This is our go to place anytime we want to have a relaxing evening and great good. Everyone there makes an effort to make each visit personal. We have tried several dishes, the lamb chops, the zin ribs, the spaghetti, pork, halibut, most of the desserts, all of the salads, and can recommend all of them! The live music is perfect and really set the entire atmosphere. They have an extensive bar and there is not a drink or spirit you won't find. You might think from this review that we know the owner or staff personally but we don't. Bottom line is if your looking for great food, great portion sizes, awesome service, great atmosphere, and making a memorable evening, try this place, you will go back!    We've been going to Tommy V's for a few years and every single time it is top notch! The service is fabulous, very attentive but not bothersome. We have tried most of their dishes and enjoyed every thing. I personally love their spaghetti with meatballs. The marina is perfect, I could actually be happy just having a bowl of the marinara with their good bread, but why limit myself to just marinara? My husband loves all of the seafood dishes and pork scallopini. And for desert you must try the frozen limoncello!  Perfect ending to a perfect evening. This is without a doubt our favorite spot in town. I tell everyone I know if you want a memorable evening go to Tommy V's, you will go back again and again.",

A member of our group had the blue cheese wedge and it looked yummy and said it was. I had the lamb chops and they were outstanding! My husband had the lasagna special and it was super good and a huge portion. Our friends both had the seafood risotto special which they said was good.  The menu was great to note gluten free options which was nice.  Our server was super nice but he was new and the only thing I would change is a little more attention. There was quite a long wait between getting our drinks and ordering and another before the dessert menus were delivered. Other staff brought us water, more drinks, removed dishes etc. so it was nice that they work on a team basis.  I would definitely return to this restaurant!",

Eggplant torta - if you like eggplant, you should try this!   Hazelnut risotto - it was alright, the nutty flavor was too strong. It overpowered the rest of the flavors.   Pasta trio - worth trying once if you're curious but wasn't amazing and wouldn't get again. Gnocchi was stuffed and made it sort of soggy. Ravioli was good but it tasted like frozen food from Costco I could have heated up.   New York Strip - worth trying! Comes with a big piece of meat over pasta. Pasta was definitely for mushroom lovers, real unique taste. Steak had a consistent texture and melted in your mouth with every bite.   Service: Service is always top notch here. You can tell they really focus on making you comfortable and cater to your needs.   Interior: Outdoor and indoor seating. The lights around their building and the restaurant next door serve as excellent decorations and give off a very calming ambience.",

Everything from start to finish was so memorable that I've finally gotten around to writing a review after all this time! As soon as we stepped inside we were greeted by various members of the staff. We had a reservation just in case, but upon being seated, our waiter brought out sparking wine and bread.   We split a Caesar salad for an appetizer and got the clam linguine and fettuccine bolognese for the entrees. All of the food was really, really good! The linguine also came with a lot of clams, so that was a nice change from what you usually get at restaurants. After our meal they brought out a slice of chocolate cake (that had been ordered behind my back) that was also delicious, and it was the perfect way to end the meal.   We weren't expecting the sparking wine, so that was a really nice surprise. I wish I remember the waiter(s) name(s) because they were fantastic and truly helped make the night memorable. I'd honestly go back just for how professional and attentive the service was.",

The waiter delivered the salad on two plates (which was unexpected and a nice touch) with the beef tenderloin delicious and prepared as ordered (medium). My wife enjoyed the risotto with artichoke which was also good. I would definitely order it again, but think bacon would be a nice addition. Next time I will ask if they could accommodate this. My grill cheese with short ribs was great. The caramelized onions complimented the flavor nicely.   Definitely recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "Chose this restaurant based on all the positive reviews but couldn't have had a more opposite experience.   We made a reservation for 9:15pm due to a late flight arrival, and as we walked up the choice was already questionable considering the restaurant with over forty tables had only one table occupied by one lonely, sunburnt couple. The lack of patronage alone made us question eating there but as most restaurants close at 10pm on a weekday we felt a bit stuck.    You'd think being one of two tables we would have received stellar service, maybe even annoyingly attentive...but think again. You'd even think they'd want to provide speedy service and get us out of there so they can end their shifts, wrong again. The wait staff seemed more concerned with drinking in the corner than serving us. While the appetizers came out in reasonable time, drinks were left low or empty, once the appetizer course was done the plates sat in front of us until the main course was ready, and we sat waiting for the main course for twenty minutes after the appetizer course. Remember we are THE ONLY people ordering food. Lastly, one of the entrees was their halibut dish, and despite being the only protein to cook for the entire restaurant the fish was over cooked by at least two minutes. If I lived here I'd make sure no one went here but as a weekend visitor I'll hope that my review can keep others from being swayed by the other historic positive reviews.",

    "text": "Perhaps we hit an off day.  Stopped in for lunch.  Maybe 15 to 20 people in the restaurant.  We were seated quickly, brought bread and water, and placed our orders.  Our Caesar salads arrived quickly.  The salad was fresh and tasty.  So far so good.  We finished our salads and water and sat there for about another 15 minutes before a server came by and refilled our glasses.  Another 15 minutes went by and 2 of the 3 dishes we ordered arrived.  The vegetable risotto had good ingredients and the rice was cooked just right, but overall it lacked much in the way of flavor.  It needed more salt, better stock, or some kind of punch.  The eggplant torte was delicious and the sauce was even better.  Eventually, the sausage that was forgotten arrived.  The sausages were pretty scorched and had very little juice left, but the meat inside had good flavor and the marinara sauce was decent.  Nobody ever came back to refill our water glasses again and I dying for some.  When one of the servers finally came back we just decided to pay our bill and get back on the road.  Overall, the dishes were a hit and miss and the service was very spotty despite the fact that there was hardly anyone in the restaurant.  Not sure what all the fuss is about, but I'm guessing we just hit it on a bad day.",

The service was attentive throughout and I appreciated them bringing an ice bucket for our Sonoma Cutrer wine without having to ask.

When I tried to find something that my picky son might enjoy, he offered to make a pasta dish that was not on the menu. I asked the waiter for a recommendation on my meal because it all looked delicious and I was having trouble deciding. He suggested the Pappardelle, sausage, broccoli, EVOO, and garlic. This was a dish I hadn't noticed while I was looking over the menu. I trusted his advise and the food did not disappoint, it was absolutely fantastic!  The sausage was firm but not overdone, the broccoli, which I always struggle to get right, was cooked to perfection and all the simple flavors complemented each other seamlessly. We finished off the meal by sharing some chocolate cake. My son stole most of it and he even wore a bit of it on his face for the ride home.   The food, the atmosphere, and the service were all top notch. I look forward to visiting again the next time I'm in town.",

I'm a concierge which means I dine out a lot as part of my job, so I'm a bit of a guest/customer service snob, so I'm not easily impressed. The location was great and easy to get to. The atmosphere was nice. Not too dark of lighting which is good. I like to be able to read the menu and see what I'm eating/drinking. I would have liked maybe a different color scheme and more Italian art, but that played no impact on my review. Timoteo was our server. He was extremely knowledgeable, kind, friendly, and quick without making us feel rushed. That's important! Too many servers/waiters these days come off as annoyed by questions, wanting you to hurry up and tip them. But not here! We felt so welcomed and comfortable...like we were with family. In the same respect, the service was not intrusive either. A perfect balance.   The food was delicious! Homemade bread to start was wonderful! Meat was perfectly cooked to order. Kudos to the kitchen staff! We loved how well Timoteo was able to make suggestions based on my indecisiveness. I just told him what I was in the mood for, and he said they could even combine the Filet and Penne with the Bolognese from a different dish! When it came time for dessert, he was fabulous once again with pairing our Tawny Porto with Tiramisu, and Moscato with Lemon Sorbet  Thank you Zoran for a wonderful restaurant, and to Timoteo for a wonderful experience! We will be back again!",

I was really looking forward to coming here to have their happy hour and somehow missed that they did not have happy hour the day we were there (that was my own fault, I'm sure). However, we had already been seated and given water and I felt uncomfortable having us leave.  We ended up ordering pasta (I got the pasta trio) and it was pretty overpriced for what it was. The restaurant was mostly empty (we were there on an early Saturday evening) and our waiter was not the most attentive. That said, I definitely want to come back to try their happy hour menu because I have heard great things about it.",

I started with lobster bisque, which was a bit pricey at $11 for a half bowl, but the flavor was good and the consistency was smooth. The bread comes out warm and is very good. I had the short ribs, which were outstanding. Served with a pillowy gnocchi, it was a perfect match. My wife had the chicken cacciatore. The chicken was prepared a bit differently from that which we are used to, fried chicken instead of baked or roasted. But, the chicken was delicious and cooked perfectly.       We did encounter one issue in that the cacciatore had red peppers and had a fairly strong red pepper taste, which my wife didn't like, but we switched dinners and I finished her cacciatore. It was great and she enjoyed the short ribs. The owner heard she didn't like the meal and offered to remove the cost from our bill, but I told him that I enjoyed the meal and that wasn't necessary. Instead he sent out some great desserts for us to try on him.      In summary, our food was terrific, service was very good, and the owner took care of what could have been an unhappy experience. All was good.",

    "text": "I had never been to this establishment & chose it based on their menu & reviews. We did have a large party (20 people) to celebrate two birthdays. The tables were prepared prior to our arrival which was impressive. The night began perfectly fine. Some dishes were better than others but I personally really enjoyed mine. When we received the checks, we noticed that those of us who had ordered salads were charged $10. This wasn't a big deal BUT it was a charge we were unaware of. We let our waitress know that it would be helpful in the future just to let people know the salads were an additional charge considering she asked \"what kind of salad would you like with your order\" instead of \"would you like to add a salad to your order\". She snapped back very matter of fact saying \"well no one else ever asks that so I don't think so\". Very rude when a \"well my apologies for the miscommunication\" would've sufficed. We ask for a manager because her attitude was not appreciated. The manager/owner came out & instead of even asking what was going on he jumped right into defending her saying \"well what place doesn't charge for salad\". We had a back & forth which ended with us explaining to him that it was never about the salad or the price. It was the fact that when we brought something to the servers attention, customer service went out the door & she was rude. I can't say this place was special enough to return to but Communication 101 could definitely take this place to higher heights. Oh... the manager did take the salads off which I would've preferred to pay the $9 if it meant having my voice valued.",

Good sized Caesar salad for $6 was really delicious.  And the artichoke risotto was not only an ample portion, but was fantastic.  Neither my wife nor I could finish our risottos, so we had them the next day for lunch as well.  That risotto is to die for.  And, for $9.50, the deal is amazing.

    "text": "Unfortunately Yelp steered me wrong on this one as our dinner was only ok.  Food: 2.5, Atmosphere: 3.5, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (entrees around $20)  Return worthiness: maybe for a drink at the bar  Highlights: - Bread: delicious slices that were crispy on the outside and warm, soft, and a tad bit sweet on the inside. 5 stars - Raviolis: special app was pretty good with a nice cream sauce to dip the bread in. 4 stars - Cocktail: fig vodka mule. Interesting twist and a solid mule. - Late dining: took reservations up until 10pm  Midlights: - Live string band was cool to have but it got really loud in the dining area - Bolognese: nice flavor but not a lot of meat. 3 stars  - Service: girl seemed nice but service was a bit awkward which was unexpected for a nicer place  Lowlights: - Seabass: way too oily and mooshy texture. Spinach was also overly oily so it was hard to eat. Very disappointing. Assume it had to be sitting too long or something since other reviewers raved about it. 1.5 star  Food was a letdown so wouldn't recommend it.",

Chris who was the head of the House was so warm and welcoming, we loved him. The mussels were delicious and we loved our meals. All 6 of us enjoyed our different choices. We're definitely coming back when we make another trip out this way. Keep up the great work at Tommy V's!!!!",

Our waiter was a bit slow, and he was sick. He spilt water on our table with out apologizing and got some on my phone when he was refilling our glasses. He was very nice, so we didn't say anything. He didn't seem to want to ask any questions on how we wanted our meal when we ordered (probably due to not feeling well). My moms burger came out on the burnt side after she said well done. The portion I got was medium sized (vodka penne), and filled me up for the most part. It's obviously not up to par with actual Italy food however, it does taste good enough.",

From the moment we walked in the door seeing the high class ambiance to the last moment when the owner of the restaurant herself walked us out and took our picture, this place exceeded every expectation! Blown away by the kind, hospitable, patient, and attentive service we received. Warm bread on the table, sumptuous pasta dishes. Loved the rigatoni with garlic cream sauce! Delicious chocolate martini! Tasted my friend's pasta trio which was good. Tends to be pricey with moderate too small portion sizes but they have some ranges of options including a wedge salad with yummy bleu cheese dressing. Food, service, and ambiance made it worth it! They even played a sweet birthday song for me across the whole restaurant! Loved my experience and will definitely be back again!",

Let me start out with the service...it was impeccable to say the least.  Our server consistently checked on us, answered all of my questions about their gluten free options & was super sweet to our 1 year old, talking directly to him, which he loved & caused him to flirt with her.  The manager (or maybe he was the owner, I'm not sure) also checked on us several times, which I truly appreciate in a restaurant. Now for the food...it was DELICIOUS!  We started out with the Chef's Plate which had meats, cheeses, olives, peppers & more.  Next up was the main course, we both ended up ordering the same thing (happens more often than not),  we got the filet & it was cooked to perfection, I decided to get the fingerling potatoes & broccoli & my husband went with the gluten free pasta option.  My mother in law ordered the salmon.  Last up was the dessert, my hubby ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake & I got the fresh berries & cream.  Everything was incredibly good & we will definitely be going back & will for sure tell our friends.",

I'm going to go with the latter, although I'm going to say right now that my rating is based off of what we ordered.  Came here for a big group birthday dinner, and I must say, the staff was very accommodating and patient.  That's half a star.    Now on to the food -   I ordered the pasta trio and the boyfriend ordered the clams linguine.    Pasta trio - Basically a sample plate of three different pastas ( tortelli, gnocchi and ravioli.)  I wasn't expecting Lake Michigan portions, but I also didn't think my meal would be bite sized.  I'm not even exaggerating  - $19 dollar plate to feed an infant.  And it was mediocre.  I'd rather pop open a can of CHEF BOY R D and squirt some Sriracha on top.    Clams Linguine - If you want to know how this tastes and you happen to live near near the ocean, jump in it and swallow the water - and try to get some clams in there too if you can.  The dish was sodium overload, although clam count was abundant.    I'd rather eat at Olive Garden.  Yeah it's a chain and it's not hip and trendy and lots of  old people frequent it, but its a safe bet vs paying 50 + for a meal and then paying another 15 for Filibertos cause you leave starving, still.",

The prices of the basic  happy hour pasta was a bit steep but the atmosphere overshadowed that. One major issue that knocked this from a 5 star experience to a 3-star is we were treated sub-par. They didn't offer us menus or send anyone over for over 7 mins. A woman in her early 50s was seated near us and wouldn't you know it- was given a menu and server within 1 minute. It was not busy at all, my friend and I were two of the only people in the restaurant at first. I do not particularly like to be ignored and sure as heck do not appreciate it. Becoming successful is what I strive to be at this time in my life and I don't need to be talked down to or treated second rate.

The food was interesting, but fell flat on flavor ...Caesar salad lettuce was fine, but they didn't have  anchovies ...said they were in the dressing ...ok, been told that before, but usual didn't bode well.  The dressing was very \"light\" ...without any hunt of warmth or anchovy.  Kinda blah.  The romaine wedge my wife had was nice, but same issue with blah dressing.  The Crostino Di Prosciutto we shared was great with suitable portion and flavorful bread and prosciutto.  Tommy's Amazing Homemade Pasta Trio was ok, but definitely not amazing .  I would like to have tried some classics but we weren't there for full dinner.  Throughout all, the server was excellent.  Net - Tommy may need to be on site more often ...perhaps get a tasting audience together and see what can be done with the basics.  No anchovy available for Caesar salad?",

Upon arrival everyone on staff new it was her Birthday and promptly wished her a happy birthday before we even sat down. The menus, created just for our party also had her name on them with a celebratory theme. Sure its a small detail but the amount of effort they put in to make her feel special was truly top notch.  On top of the amazing customer service the food was top notch and  well prepared. I recommend the Filet if your willing to spend the extra coin for it. Easily one of the best I've had in town.  Overall, in case you can't already tell, this place earns its five star rating from me and I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone back here!",

Our waiter, Robert, was excellent and the owner Zoran was attentive and very friendly.  Our dinners were fantastic.   I had the halibut and my wife had the Chilean bass.  Both dishes were delicious and beautifully presented and served at prefect serving temperatures.  The fingerling potatoe sides were also wonderful and the beet salad that my wife and shared was delicious.  My friend who loves short ribs ordered them and raved about how good they were - generous portion also.  All in all, one of the best local dinners we've enjoyed in Scottsdale in quite some time and at a price that won't empty your wallet.  Will go again soon.  My wife and I have attended two wine tasting dinners at Tommy V's previously and they we're also excellent -with very generous pours.  Do yourself a favor and check to see when Zoran will next host another wine tasting dinner and bring some friends- you'll be sure to enjoy.  Bob - Paradise Valley, AZ",

I can't say enough about how friendly and knowledgeable the staff was.  Our waiter was helpful, patient, and a great source if you have any questions about the food menu or wine list... Very Friendly (we were there for almost 3 hours) I tried to order items I might not see on other local Italian menus, or looked for a new twist on ingredients and sauces.  I had the fresh anchovies for an appetizer - reminded me of Bocarones in Spain - Yummy and Fabulous.  My friend and I share the veal on the \"Special of the night menu\" and thank goodness we shared it.  The 1/2 was a complete meal and more.  It was done to perfections, great flavors.  Dessert - the lemon tart.  My friend choose this, I wanted the sorbet, but I went a long with tart.  I'm not an expert on tarts, I thought it was very good, but prefer a bit more sting to the tongue.  If you haven't been to Tommy V's, and you're thinking about it, Go!",

I feel the only difference between Tommy V's and Tomaso's really is the decor.  Tomaso's has that old school Italian restaurant vibe.  Tommy V's has a modern contemporary interior with a few pictures of girls on the walls where all you can focus on are their boobs.  It was kinda funny that all three of us at dinner noticed it. I had the eggplant torta and butternut squash ravioli.  The eggplant torta tasted to me like eggplant parmesan but in a lasagna type shape.  The butternut squash ravioli was divine.  I would love if I could just have a giant bowl of that! We made reservations, but being that it was a Thursday night in the summer, they weren't really necessary.   Their prices pretty much start at $15 and go up.  I noticed they have a decent happy hour menu if you are a bargain eater.   This would be a fantastic date spot, but sit inside.  The patio would probably be nice during the day with friends, but there's nothing romantic about sharing a bottle of wine in front of the Grapevine and a parking lot. Great Italian and great atmosphere!",

    "text": "I went here last night with the BF. The place had some very good points, but also a lot of points that need improvement. So we got there early for our reservation, but were seated anyway...good point. We were sat at a high top table....but our menus and the wine list were too big to fit on the table, making for awkward shuffling of menus, trying not to knock anything off of the high top table...not the best planning on their part. The place is very loud, as the decor is kind if industrial and all of the sounds bounce around a lot. I got a glass of the riesling and it was very good. The bread they brought out was good, I liked that it was warm and toasted, I wish the oil had more vinegar in it, but it was tasty all the same.  I ordered the short ribs and the BF got the capellini. The capellini was actually very good....the sauce had a very robust flavor, even a little spicy and the portion was big. The short ribs were kind of meh. I thought the flavor was fine, but they could be cooked longer. There was a ton of fat still on the ribs (usually it has largely melted away by the time they are served) and although I did NOT have to use a knife, I had to work very hard with my fork to eat them....which should never be the case with braised short rib. The gnocchi that came with the rib, however, was very good.... it was a stuffed gnocchi, which I have never had before. We ordered the tiramisu for dessert and thought that the tiramisu itself was good, very light and airy, but with a lot of espresso flavor, but they plated it with very pretty lines of strawberry sauce and chocolate. The strawberry sauce had a strange flavor....not good, and the bites with it (which were many of them) had a strange flavor from the sauce, I saw the pic on here with the tiramisu in a bowl and the sauces on the side....that would have been the perfect presentation so we could opt out of the strawberry. So anyway, the place had some serious highs (great pasta), but also a lot of lows, which made me feel that it wouldn't be worth the cost to return in the near future.",

I ordered the trio pasta and switched out the sauce for the light cream tomato sauce- which turned out to basically be tomato pasta sauce. My fiance asked for lobster ravioli with the same sauce and got about 7ish raviolis. Overall the portions are pretty small, which is fine. But the price is fairly high in comparison to that. $20 for mine and $28 for his. This is probably because it's a lot more authentic Italian food than Olive Garden LOL. They ended up surprising me with a piece of chocolate mousse cake and a lit candle so that was pretty sweet :) overall a positive experience but probably wouldn't go back because of the price",

The sauce comes on the side and is very light steak sauce True to Italian tradition but it makes all the difference in taste.  The homestyle potato wedges that come with it are awesome!!  The lobster and shrimp fettucini is good as well.  A lot of subtle Italian flavors.  Flavors are not strong and intense like ribeye steak and sauce.  I would suggest eating this mild flavored dish before eating something much more stronger like steak.  The caesar salad was good and fresh.  The croutons taste homemade.  The Coppa Di Amaretto Dessert was fun to eat.   Nothing great but good fun sweet to share after a meal.  Overall we had a good time and will come back.",

The eggplant torta was okay, but not something we'd go back for, although fresh ground pepper and decent parmigiana were plusses. My feeling is the eggplant should have been cut into thinner slices and of course cooking them in a wood burning often would have been the real deal. It was the dessert, however, that took away the extra half point, the one that would have moved us from a 3 1/2 and therefore a 3 to a 4. Quite simply, it tasted like commercial cake delivered by truck to a restaurant that didn't have its own pastry chef. Just blah.",

We had 5 alcoholic beverages, calamari and 2 entrees all for around $100 which was fantastic!  The atmosphere is lively but still opulent. Our waitress, Brooke, was absolutely fantastic! She was very attentive to our needs and helped us choose delicious drinks and food.  My only downer was the beer was bottled and not on tap but it would not keep me from coming back!!  Highly recommend!!",

We ordered 3 chefs boards and 2 orders of calamari for the table to nosh on while we waited for our lunches.  The appetizers were very good.   Now I can only attest to what I had for lunch. My one coworker and I couldn't decide on what we wanted.  We both wanted risotto and to try a sandwich, so we split the Short Rib sandwich and risotto carbonara.  The sandwich was amazing!!  Tender meat and nicely crisp fries.  The risotto fell a little short. I've had risotto at restaurants and have made risotto at home.  It is a long painstaking process.  But well worth the attention to detail and time it takes. Creamy, kinda.  Flavorful, no. Which was surprising. I had to add both salt (again surprising cause it had pancetta and parm) and pepper to it.  We both agreed that the sandwich was the better of the two we split.    Service however was outstanding. If I could give partial stars, I'd rate 3.50-3.75",

I wasn't drinking that night but the bartender was cool and didn't mind (a lot give you a nasty glare when you sit at the bar and don't drink.) I had the Caesar salad and the pork Osso Buco special. The romaine lettuce is as fresh and crispy and the dressing was just right. The pork slid right off the bone and was extremely tender and moist. The sauce wasn't too heavy and the root vegetables were a nice pairing. Another night my wife and I sat outside (at 58 it was too cold for you Arizonans) so we were the only ones outside. Regardless, the waitress was extremely attentive. We had the caprese to start with a nice bottle of Chardonnay. Wine prices are fairly reasonable. The tomatoes and mozzarella were extremely fresh. I ordered the chicken Marsala which was very nice. The only weird thing is that they paired the penne with a marinara sauce so that was odd. My wife had the sea bass which she enjoyed thoroughly. The inside is a little loud but overall this is a nice spot to dine.",

    "text": "Tommy V's will always have a special place in my heart.  My boyfriend wanted to come here to celebrate some of our recent milestones. This place is the absolute perfect place to wine and dine (and seriously impress your date!).  It's a quiet place with dimmed lights and tea light candles scattered throughout.  Super warm, comfortable and romantic.  And parking is certainly not an issue.  Our waiter was phenomenal.  We were immediately seated and our glasses of water were never empty (we were here for 2-3 hours).  Upon introducing himself (omg I forgot his name), he casually asked us what we were celebrating, went through the dinner menu, and also pointed out some wines he recommended with certain dishes.  We started off with the calamari -- yum! You know how some places fry their calamari for too long or not long enough? That certainly wasn't the case at Tommy V's.  The chefs surely know how to make a bomb calamari.  Crunchy, nicely salted and peppered, and each piece was the perfect size (ladies, you don't need to worry about messing up your lipstick that you spent forever applying!).  My boyfriend got the Osso Buco on Risotta Veal Sugo & Hazelnuts.  Holy cow this dish was HUGE.  My SO really struggled to finish this dish, but he loved every single bite he could take.  I had a bite of it and wow, it was super tender and flavorful! And when I say super tender, I mean melt-in-your-mouth kind of tender.  If you're going for this dish, I recommend skipping appetizers and going straight for the entree.  I had the Pappardelle Funghi Di Bosco & Veal Ragu.  Like my SO's dish, this dish was also gigantic! Their pasta was sooooo incredibly soft (its homemade) and their black truffle sauce was so freaking good.  I always like a restaurant that knows how to make a good truffle! Tommy V has definitely mastered this.  As for the wine, I can't recall the name.  I'm pretty sure it was a Decoy Red. My SO always picks the wine and I always just drink it.  Needless to say, we finished an entire bottle in no time.  And finally, after we asked for the check, our waiter came out with a generous slice of a RICH chocolate cake with a whopping dollop of whip cream.  On the side of the cake was \"congratulations\" written in chocolate syrup.  I highly recommend Tommy V's.  It was the PERFECT date night.",

It came with a really good tomato sauce. Then had a mixed seafood dish with shrimp, scallops and a small piece of salmon over a bed of braised greens. The greens stole the show for me.

    "text": "Now I have to apologize in advance for the delay of this review. We dined here on Saturday night, finally getting the opportunity to review now.   We made reservations thinking it would be crowded on a Saturday night in Scottsdale, nope. The hostess was extremely friendly and seated us right away. Upon walking in you can't help but notice the ambiance. It's decorated very modern and tasteful. Making you want to see what the kitchen will create!   The waiter, Jonathan came to introduce himself and get our drink order right away! His vast knowledge of the wines and their flavors/ pairings was impressive! It definitely is a huge asset and came in very helpful to us. He guided us through the menu. We appreciated Jonathan's knowledge and recommendations, especially with my being vegetarian.   Our food came and it was delicious and extremely fresh! We loved the fried burrata!!! I can't recommend it enough!!!  The creaminess of the cheese will the freshness of the tomato or the peppers is heavenly, not to mention the basil!!  My husband loved his salmon too. The portion was large and everything was extremely fresh tasting.   Now as for my spaghetti and meatballs ( no meatballs because vegetarian), you claim to be a \" urban Italian Kitchen \" the marinara sauce tasted like it was out of a jar and looked like it. The pasta was cooked properly, and the additional fresh basil helped. Yet, I would think the pasta sauce would have had more flavor or be True Italian. ( Yes, I am Greek and Italian... so I know a good traditional sauce).   And last but, not least my biggest complaint of all the MUSIC!!!!! It was awful.... straight out of prom night from the 80 or 90's. I heard more Elton John ( Disney Songs) then when my kids were small ( they are 23 now). It is a Saturday night in downtown Scottsdale the last thing we want is bedtime music or music to relax you at 9:30 at night. If you claim to be a urban restaurant and considering your location, you can't have this type of music playing.   Overall we loved our waiter and the rest of the staff! The menu options we tried were good some were fabulous. If the music is different it's a place we would return to, otherwise in a town this competitive we will find one that has it all.",

We also were happy to find out they have a fantastic happy hour.  And I mean fantastic.  Good wines and amazing selections for very reasonable prices.  You can also order off the substantial dinner menu.  We tried the Tenderloin Panzanella Salad, Risotto with Pancetta and Peas and Spaghetti Picchio Pacchio.  All were really good.  Service was TOP NOTCH and I'd also like to add that while I wouldn't say this restaurant caters to children, we had ours in tow (ages 3, 5 and 8) and the staff was AMAZINGLY accommodating to them and so very friendly to us.  I really appreciated this.  We take our children out often as they are well behaved and we enjoy eating out as a family.  A wonderful experience, we can't wait to return!",

I had the pasta trio which was delicious! Each pasta was very different but complimented each other perfectly. My friend had the grilled shrimp risotto. She said it was good, but probably wouldn't order it again. The best part was possibly the chocolate mousse cake. It was amazing! And perfect to share. All in all, Tommy V's is a fun place for dinner, a date, or a special night out.",

Tommy Vs is great tasting italian food without breaking the bank.  I've even met the owner Zoron on multiple occassions and he's a very hands on and involved owner.  For lunch, their grilled beef tenderloin salad is best fare for eating with guests, coworkers, or if you decide to entertain clients. The perfect balance between fresh salad and juicy steak.  The Fettucuni Bolognese is also another great dish with made from scratch sauces.   I've been going here for over a year with my family, friends, and clients and have never been disappointed once. Oveall just a great place.",

The date was 12/10/15, and our server helped the party of (4) from out of town in the outside seating area (even attempted 10x to get then small heater to work, it did!)  Food presentation was as great as it tasted. The waiter's suggestions for meals didn't seem forced on us, but helpful suggestions about what they do strongly at the facility. The eggplant dish was amazing, balanced w the ravioli flavored in a different colored sauce and tapered in an almost yin-yang patten to blend the two items together.   The staff was way past accommodating about the separate checks, as we each had to write off for our jobs.   Owners: if you're reading this you have great staff. Especially ours from the night of 12/10 that helped the Alaska-Baltimore m-NY table! Thanks",

Lobster Fra Diavolo Was a killer pasta dish with some heat, plenty of clams, shrimp and scallops, and a lobster tail on top.

Initially, seated at the bar, but the bartender/server(Angel) was a bit smug, surly, and unfriendly upon our arrival, thus we, politely asked for reseating at a table! Great call as we had a wonderful, personable server, whom made delicious recommendations on the food menu. Ordered delightful cocktails, succulent short rib stacks, ceasar salads...flavorful dressing, tho a bit overdressed, w crunchy croutons, and a smoky risotto carbonera....The Bomb! Had a lovely glass of Carminerre w the risotto to complete our meal! What a wonderful find...cannot wait to return w more of my clan!!",

It happened to be Arizona Restaurant Week so we opted for the set menu of $33 which provided several choices of starters.  I had the STRAWBERRY BABY GREENS SALAD - Delish!  My husband had the RISSOTO WITH ARTICHOKES and he loved it.  For our entree's I had the CHICKEN FLORENTINE and my husband had the PORK SCALLOPINI.  For dessert I chose the SALTED CARAMEL GELATO and my husband chose the CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE.    Wow!  Everything was cooked very well and to our surprise the waiter served a couple of cannoli's with a little candle to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary which I noted in the Open Table reservation.    It's a white tablecloth restaurant with an excellent wine list.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant as the prices are reasonable too.",

    "text": "Tommy V's Urban Kitchen and Bar completely understands what it takes to be a local restaurant that is successful. Its not just about the food, or just the drinks etc...its the whole package and that's exactly what you get at Tommy V's!  I have dined here many times, always impressed with the Mahi Mahi daily feature, with lemony butter sauces and delightful grilled fingerling potatoes, as well as the Zin Braised Short Ribs with Aromatic Vegetables, Asiago & DELICIOUS Spinach Gnocchi. Exquisite wine selections that beautifully pairs with the cuisine top it all off. I love arriving early evening because the restaurant glows beautifully in the evening dusk light and with GM Zoran greeting every guest as the arrive, you feel as if you have arrived at home.  I had the pleasure of attending last weekend's Rusack Wine dinner of five wonderful courses that took your palate on a fantastic journey of flavors, textures and perfectly paired wines! The first course of Crab Cakes paired with a Santa Ynez Valley Sauv Blanc was a wonderful start to the meal- the wine was just crisp enough to mate with the lovely tastes of the cakes. Second course was a just large enough portion of Orrechiette pasta w sauteed scallops and shrimp in a tomato cream sauce paired with a lovely Santa Barbara Chardonnay that was just oaky enough to stand up wonderfully to the pasta dish. Third course was beautiful piece of Mahi Mahi served with a wonderful veggie Ragu- lentils, mushrooms, brussel sprouts...was delicious and I couldn't stop eating it- even though I knew we had 2 more courses to go! The wine paired with the Mahi Mahi was a Pinot Noir from Santa Barbara, which seems counterintuitive but master mind Zoran who did the food pairings was spot on- the richness of the Ragu and texture of the Mahi worked beautifully as a team. The Main Course was Zin Braised Short Ribs paired with an escarole and white bean salad that was a lovely partner to the hearty short ribs, all the flavors mingled together well. A bold Ballard Canyon estate Syrah was paired with the Main course, which was a lovely finale to the main courses. Dessert was heavenly! A limoncello sorbet paired with a light and fresh dessert wine by the name of La Fleur Renaissance Sauternes. All in all, Tommy V's is the whole package. Great food, wine and cocktails, ambiance, live jazz and of course wonderful staff- the GM Zoran will greet you at the door and ensure a perfect experience. Cheers!",

But any question of how good this place was immediately was put to rest as our server came to our table.   Had the option to order off of regular menu  or special lunch menu. Our party ordered from both, an from what I gather the lunch menu was the same high quality and serving size as the dinner menu but for 2/3 the price. Yay!  I had the braised beef, super ridiculous tender, rich and flavorful. Gnocchi was super fresh. Wife had the handmade linguini and clams.  Fresh and flavorful. How u can taste the difference when it comes to handmade pasta and fresh versus frozen seafood.  They're on point here.    Would highly recommend this place for both service and food. An if u want a great value, check it out at lunch.",

It is served with a dip made of vinegar and oil. (no butter if you have to wonder, and we did not ask for some).  Cocktail drinks were great and again, we had the best service. Very prompt on refilling drinks, food and wine (they have a great wine menu).  The issue seemed to be the food. We first ordered mussels. They were cooked well, but were a little fishy. You decide.  The veal Milanese was very forgetful and and heavy. The way it was cooked must have hid the unique taste of veal. The others in the group had same issues with their meal.    However, their sides are amazing. The sausage were to die for and their Kobe beef meat balls are also fantastic.  The atmosphere is classy and awesome. If I were to come again, I will stick with the sides :)",

Happy hour goes until 6:30 and is very reasonable with $5 glasses of wine, and inexpensive well drinks. The wine menu was expansive, I enjoyed a good merlot and white from Chile.  We started with the mozz bruchetta, and it was served traditionally, with pieces of mozz mixed in. This was on happy hour as well.   For dinner, we got two plates, the eggplant forte, and also the butternut squash raviolis, which was on the super happy hour portion of the menu. Both dishes were deliciously delicate and you could tell they made the ravioli dough in house. The service was also stand-out and I think the owner is the one who sat us, I respected how he was helping the waiters get tables sat and involved in his restaurant, that's probably one of the reasons why everything about the restaurant was exceptional, with attention-to-detail. We will definitely be back.",

The big ball of fried, breaded appetizer was something I probably made in home ec 20 years ago, and should have never been let out of the kitchen. But alas, serve it they did.   I went for a mixer and the service was less than good. I guess when you tell a place you're bringing a buttload of people in, they don't prepare. The A/C was miserable, bartenders were overworked and empty drink glasses just don't cut it in my book.   Will I return? Doubtful. Too many other places that don't try to slip fake Malibu to a guest.",

The pasta was from bags and microwaved; the salads were premade; the organic food is about as organic as my shoe.  The most casual observer can just sit at the bar and watch what the kitchen is doing, and it is busy, but 2 guys reheating stuff. It is a shame, as the place looks great, but what a mess.  I sat; watched and left after finishing my drink.  I was going to ask the manager what the hell that was about; but he was apparently too busy with the table of women by the window.  One star for location Minus one star for pasta sauce coming out of tin cans One star for a fantastic patio Minus one star for pasta from Fry's coming out of plastic One star for great decor...  This could go on for days.... but I am hungry...",

    "text": "Based upon almost universal positive Yelp reviews, I had very high expectations for Tommy V's and was unfortunately disappointed.  The food was good, ambience was lovely, service was a tad slow but very earnest (he was very busy running around from table to table).  The best dish of the night? grilled asparagus side - very good, tender and flavorful anchovy, olive appetizer - good and tasty pepper, cured meat plate - not bad, but doesn't taste like it is house-cured (wish it were)  The entrees? A bit of a disappointment Spaghetti with meat balls - this was the best dish. I think the pasta could be a little more al dente but the sauce was tasty and the meatballs were very tender. But \"better than Mom's\" - I think that is a stretch.  Clams with Linguini - big disappointment. The dish comes piled with clams, but they are of the canned variety. The dish overall lacked flavor - could have used more olive oil, red pepper, garlic, clam flavor. Also could have used some parmesan cheese  Pasta Trio? The sage butter pasta was the best. The gnocchi was gummy - but isn't that what it always tastes like? (as you can see, not a big fan of gnocchi in general).  The short ribs - meh, I have had much better. Very tender, but the sauce could have used a bit more red wine reduction and less salt.  Cannoli dessert - okay (I've had better)  Tiramisu - a bit too sweet for my liking.  Pistachio ice cream was interesting, it was a log of pistachio ice cream coated with crushed pistachio nuts and chocolate then sliced and presented in slices on a plate.",

I don't think I will ever be able to be completely satisfied with other restaurants variations on Mussels for the rest of my life. The sauce was light, but so rich in flavor. Mmmm! I ordered the Manila Clams Linguine. Sooo tasty and a great transition from the mussels. The sauce wasn't too rich, and their clams were delicious (no surprise). I tasted the Zin Braised Short Ribs with the gnocchi, and it was great too. Do not hesitate, go now!",

First, it's a great looking place on the inside very open which I always like. Second the $5 wine list for the happy hour wasn't just a few choices of low end suppliers like Gallo, but really good wines and lots of them. Finally, we two of the twenty or so food items on the Happy Hour menu, I had the Eggplant Torte, I judge all italian restaurants by their eggplant, its one of the hardest things to get right. This was some of the best eggplant I ever had. It was fork tender and had an amazing tomato herb sauce on it, delicious. My friend had the Bruschetta Caprese of the Happy Hour menu, which was wonderful and then tried the Goat Cheese & Basil Stuffed Squash Blossom & Heirloom Cherry Tomato Salad. First, you hardly ever see anyone serve squash blossoms which is a real italian treat, but I have never seen it stuffed with goat cheese, mozzarella yes, goat never. It was FANTASTIC. I think it and the eggplant are two of the best things I have tasted in a while.   To top it all off the service was fantastic, this place is a real gem of a find. We are just sorry we had to leave so soon, we even met two nice people there and exchanged cards, what a great place, can't wait to go back, so probably won't. Can't wait to try the Pork Osso Buco.  Bravo Tommy V's, I'll Be Back",

The bread was crusty on the outside & chewy on the inside -very yummy.  We sat at the bar as we usually do and the bartender brought over a sample of their meet sauce to try with more bread.  I don't eat meat sauce but my husband said it was very good.  I had a heft cosmo & my husband had a beer.  For dinner i had the pasta trio that was fabulous - probably the best italian food i've had since the cioppino at Allesia's restaurant.  My husband had the linguine with white clam sauce also very good.  I'm certain these pasta dishes were homemade because they just had amazing flavor - I wanted more!! We finished with tiramisu that was also really great.  My husband had coffee and even that was great.  A little pricey in my opinion for italian food but due to how great all of it tasted -  we think it was worth it.  This will be a definite dining destination in the future.",

Of course only if you're a fan of a huge selection of food (small plates) at HH prices, and excellent wines by the glass for $5! I went with a group of 5 girls, we made reservations for 6PM, and despite the Networking event of about 200 people in the bar, we got right in and had superb service. You could tell the entire staff was working as team, which is impressive for a restaurant that has only been open for a couple weeks.  We split a selection of items to get an idea of their menu:  Butternut squash raviolis with sage butter sauce, fried gnocchi with marinara, fig and goat cheese sliders, risotto carbonara and spinach and cheese raviolis (shaped in little hearts)! Everything that I tried was excellent, and I was very impressed with the homemade ravioli's (At least they fooled me if they weren't!) To top it off their bread was amazing, crispy on the outside and soft in the middle, served with some sort of herb infused olive oil.  They did a great job converting the old Cafe Carumba into an urban yet sophisticated lounge, the patio is huge ... and has comfortable seating(Well once summer is over)! This is definitely my new \"Go To\" Happy hour spot for a date with my Hottie, or a drink with my girls =)",

My day was small.  Three shrimp the size of a pea pod.  Tasty but not anything to come back for.  My date ordered the Chef's Platter and the pasta trio.  We had looked at past Yelp reviews and everyone said the trio was great.  My date said the platter and trio were both good but he didn't think the Salmonella poisoning he got afterwards was too wonderful.

The waitress, upon finding out it was my birthday, gave us a free appetizer, limocello shot, desert and after dinner cappuccino. It was very nice of her to do all that for me, it was way beyond  the standard free desert you get anywhere else. The appetizer she gave us was the Burrata, and it was simply amazing, The mozzarella literally melts in your mouth. We had also ordered the Pancetta Wrapped Prawns and they were delicious as well. For dinner I had the Salmon and it was absolutely perfect. Crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and full of flavor. It really hit the spot. I had thought about ordering the Sea Bass, but the waitress advised against it letting me know that it isn't one of their best dishes. I always appreciate it when the server will steer you in the right direction so you enjoy your meal. I couldn't have enjoyed the dinner more and will definitely be coming back to Tommy V's. Thank you to my friend and the waitress for a great dinner and dirty thirty.",

We ordered the Santa Cristina Sangiovese 2009 for our wine selection, which was excellent (looking at reviews of this wine, some really liked it, others said ho hum.  We were very pleased with it, maybe it has improved over the past 6 months?).  From there, we each tried a different salad.  All three of them (Caesar, Wedge, and Chopped) were excellent.  My wife and I both had the Tommy's Amazing Homemade Pasta Trio of home made pastas, which were very flavorful.  I cold have eaten a couple more each of the tortelli and ravioli for the price, but the flavor of each of the three (spinach ravioli, portabella tortelli and brie/asiago/butter-sage gnochi) was absolutely excellent.  Mom had the shrimp and risotto, which was also excellent.  We finished off sharing the canoli, which was good, and some espresso.  Overall, the service was attentive (VERY important to me), our waiter, Hernan, was a really great guy and provided friendly, excellent service.  We will be back.",

The place looks open and one can move easily around the restaurant without bumping into everyone and everything. But, let's talk about what really matters, the food. Since I was very limited on time, I decided to look into their Happy Hour menu; which by the way it starts at 11:00 and ends at 6:00 PM. It is fairly extensive and reasonably priced with items ranging from salads to calamari, Bruschetta and paninis, sliders and burgers. I decided to try one of their burgers and it was great. Meat was cooked to taste and was served on a ciabatta roll with a healthy portion of French Fries. I decided to eat my lunch with a glass of wine from their very ample selection available. Sadly, I didn't get a chance to order dessert, but I will make sure to next time so I can write another review about it. I anticipate nothing but great things for this place. Pretty soon the next time I want to eat there I will require a reservation.",

The lunch menu is somewhat limited but everything is half price. If you work in the area and you do not come to this place at least once a week for lunch you are crazy. I had the smoked salmon bruschetta and the wife had the kobe beef stacks. Both were on point and the presentation heres is amazing, the food looked elegant and well thought out. It had the look and feel of a 5 star restaurant. The only reason this place did not get 5 stars was due to some minor lacking in the execution area. They give some good bread to start you off, but then they used the same bread for the bruschetta in the salmon dish. I personally feel that starter bread should only be used as a starter and nothing else, However this place was outstanding in every other aspect and I will be back!",

I started with the calamari which was crispy with a chunky marinara sauce. I ordered the pasta trio. I found it quite enjoyable with the mushroom ravioli being my favorite.  One of my dining mates ordered something off menu full of linguini and seafood. Although the scallops were a little overcooked it was still tasty. The chicken parmigiano was some of the best I've had. The short ribs were a little dry without the sauce. Overall the food was delicious and worth a second visit.",

What a nice gesture, and it went above and beyond my expectations. I travel extensively for work, and sometimes you just want something simple and familiar, and this place offered both. I can't wait to go back on my next trip, particularly for a splurge meal - the menu looked awesome!",

My colleague and I always choose something a bit more upscale on our last dinner in town on business trips and we were very happy with our choice to dine at Tommy V's.   The wine selection to start was good and had some \"off-the-beaten-path\" choices. The plates were equally wonderful.   My colleague is a sucker for pasta and therefore chose the Carbonara. I had a taste and thought it was very nice. Not as creamy as Carbonara is usually served on the East Coast but really nice. Very flavorful and just a tad lighter than normal. I had the Sea bass and it was very tasty with the lentils.  The service was good and the premises very clean and attractive. Looking forward to return trips to the area so I can enjoy this restaurant again.  Enjoy!",

Bread and water were brought to the table promptly and a quick explanation of what specials were available that evening. Friendly welcoming staff is always a plus to me.  We had the kobe beef meatballs which tasted great but basically a meatball to me!  The manila clam linguine was very light tasting and you do get loads of clams. All in all, it was very easy to eat. If that's what you are after then you can't go wrong with this dish.  I had the veal which was also excellent. Complemented excellently with vegetables and mash. Yummy.  Thanks!",

    "text": "This place actually reminds me of a restaurant in Milan that I visited once.  Sure, there were all kinds of traditional trattorias and pizzerias but there were also these modern restaurants that had contemporary and sleek decor, who also presented a new perspective on Italian food.  Tommy V's falls in this latter category.  I really love how the main dining room has great windows to the street.  It's fun to look out and as a passerby one might think \"I wish I was in there\".  The moody lighting and hard wood floors give this place an elegant yet warm vibe.  The size of the restaurant is ample so this would make a great place to host a dinner party.  The food is Italian but you will not find all of the cliche Italian American dishes.  Instead diners are offered selections such as Bucatini and other plates that are more regional and similar to what you would get in Italy.   Oh yeah, pastas are hand made daily.  If this weren't enough, Tommy V's is affiliated with Tomaso's so many of the same techniques and elements are incorporated here.  If you want to experience a modern, elegant, yet friendly and warm Italian restaurant that serves a blend of modern and authentic Italian cuisine then I can't think of a much better choice than Tommy V's.",

    "text": "Found this place via Yelp because I was specifically craving pasta, and I am a picky Italian cook.  My toddler daughter and I met 3 friends there around 6:15pm.  It was not too packed, and they immediately had a high chair waiting for our table.  The 4 of us ordered 4 appetizers (the squash ravioli, the carpacchio, the artichoke heart risotto, and the fried gnocchi), and every single one of them was truly great.  (If I want to get really specific, I will say that the fried gnocchi was a little bland, but gnocchi is bland on its own anyway, so I wasn't expecting otherwise.  Also, I will say that I have had better carpacchio... not in terms of quality, but in terms of presentation and flavor.)  Even my daughter loved all 4 appetizers!  For dinner I couldn't decide between the pasta with clams and the capellini (angel hair with tomato and basil), so Joshua (BEST SERVER!!), suggested he would split the entree in half for me so that I could try both... which was totally awesome.  Both entrees were so good!  I have to mention here that the pasta with clams is the best I have ever had-- it was NOT in a cream sauce or a red sauce.  Instead, it was in a light herb/oil sauce with fresh garlic cloves... perfect!  My friends got the veal and the chicken marsala, which were also truly wonderful.  Total bill for the 4 of us with 4 appetizers, 3 entrees, soft drinks, and 4 alcoholic drinks was $99.  Great!  For service, vibe, and food quality, you really can't go wrong with this place.  I am so excited to finally find a great Italian restaurant-- that doesn't cost a million dollars-- right by Old Town Scottsdale. :)",

    "text": "Loved this place!!  Lovely upscale-casual atmosphere, a delicious meal, pleasant service.  After three consistently wonderful visits, I have to say they have earned 5 stars.  The bread is pretty fantastic - it's very soft but substantial (no doughy), with a perfect crust.    On our first visit, we started with a pear salad, which was nice but fairly average.  The dressing was a light mustard over arugula leaves with blue cheese and pear - very innocuous and delicate.   For dinner, we had the Eggplant Torta.  The eggplant is firm and lightly breaded.  It's smothered in a light, delectable rose sauce and a small amount of cheese.  The accompanying butternut squash ravioli is served with a touch of cream sauce and has cinnamon mixed inside.  All of the flavors perfectly complement one another.  It's a remarkably smooth, subtle and delicious dish!    We were trying to decide between two entrees and our server highly recommended the eggplant - he has our gratitude!  He said it's his favorite on the menu, plus it's a generous portion (perfect to split) - great call.  The rest of their service was also really polite and efficient.  The kitchen split both plates for us and the bus boy refilled my water every few minutes (the glasses were small and I drink a lot - huge kudos on this) and brought more bread.   Since we've been back, I'd highly recommend the shrimp and crab ravioli appetizer and the Pasta Trio - each one sublime!    The only item I'd warn against is the chocolate mousse cake - it tasted like an escapee from a diner (poor quality and texture meets artificial flavor) and totally didn't belong at such a fine establishment - maybe get the cannoli instead.",

Both were great, especially the tender chicken and buttery lemon sauce. Next time we had the ravioli trio and the lobster and shrimp linguini. These were probably the best pasta dishes either of us have ever had. But THEN there was the third visit...where pretty much everything was wrong. We started with the lobster bisque which was watery, had shells/  cartilage in it, and was really spicy. No one told us in advance that it was spicy. We sent it back and the owner came out and argued with us--basically saying we were wrong about not liking the soup. Main course was the short rib sandwich and the chicken picatta again. Short rib and chicken were both dry as a bone and nearly inedible. Since we'd already been put in our place by the owner on the soup, we didn't feel comfortable sending back our entrees, even though they should have been returned.   So I will probably not go back there due to inconsistencies, but 2/3 experiences were perfection so that's why I give 3 stars.",

I'd definitely have the Amatricianna or anything off the pasta menu.  We saw a few of those dishes come out and they all looked delicious.  Dessert was really good.

    "text": "I'll keep it short. Came here with a group of 8 for a birthday dinner. You would think a highly rated, nice Scottsdale restaurant to be pleasant to dine at. The thermostat read 81 but it felt like 85. Everyone was sweating all night and I could see people at other tables constantly wipe their foreheads. I asked the server if their ac was broken and was given the rudest look. He said he would see if he can do something but it was hot for  the entire two hours we were there. The server forgot our beer order. most of the table ordered a dish on the special menu that said it had crab, lobster, etc. but when we got the dish, the amount of seafood for the price was VERY DISAPPOINTING and the flavor wasn't anything special. The live band and the bread they give you was probably the best thing about this place. All 8 of us agreed we would NOT be coming back here..",

There was a jazz trio that we really enjoyed.  The food was good as well.  My friend had the lobster bisque and really liked it.  I started with a salad.  I had the halibut in a lemon wine sauce and came with sauteed spinach and fingerling potatoes.  The fish was cooked nicely, that sauce was a nice complement.  The spinach also had a nice taste. The food wasn't fantastic but pretty good.   The service was good throughout the meal.",

    "text": "I was disappointed with the food, based on some of the earlier reviews I have read. I'm in the fishing business and know my fish. So I ordered \"Sea Bass\" expecting a rich moist fish that would almost melt in your mouth. But instead, I got an overcooked white fish that had the texture of an over cooked halibut filet. I wasn't certain, but it could have been halibut, which is not the best fish in the world. Because Sea Bass is a lot like sablefish (blackcod) and has a high oil content, it should have been moist and wonderful. This was a real disappointment.  My friends had the bouillabaisse fish stew and it was OK, but not exceptional tasting. It could have been prepared with a little more garlic, and a ting of saffron to flavor it up a bit.  The service was so, so and we had to keep asking for the water to be refilled. Which was strange, because the restaurant was maybe 60% full for a Friday night.  Nice atmosphere and the music was nice playing in the background.",

    "text": "My family and I (4 adults 2 kids) were in Scottsdale for the weekend.  We stayed at the W-Scottsdale and was craving Italian.  I did a search on Yelp and Tommy V's was 1/4 mile away from our hotel with great reviews.  We went there around 2:00 so it wasn't crowded and we were seated right away.  The service was good and the food was dynamite.  My husband said it was the best Chicken Piccata he's ever had and my father in law had the Artichoke Hearts Risotto and he said it was excellent.   I had the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce and it was very tasty.    All in all the place was great and if we're in Scottsdale again, this is a place that we will go again.    However there was one thing that I wish I said because now I'm kicking myself in the butt.  My mother in law ordered the Chicken Parmesean sandwich with fries on their Happy Hour menu. When the bill came, I was charged for the Chicken Parmesean entree.  The difference between these two plates was $10.00.  For me $10.00 is a lot of money but we were in a  hurry so I didn't want to say anything.  So make sure to check your bill to to confirm that you weren't charged for something else.",

Nice selection of wines and cocktails, moderately priced. My Bellini was a little peach-heavy, but a subsequent glass of prosecco was lovely. Perusing the appetizer menu, I came upon marinated white anchovies with roasted red peppers that was out of this world. Combined it with the rustic bread served as a pre-appetizer-a match made in heaven. Salads were quite satisfying. We sampled four different kinds and the romaine wedge emerged as the favorite. One visit, I had the pear salad with shrimp added as an entree. The eggplant torta was really delicious. The addition of squash ravioli to the plate gave a pleasing contrast to the cheesy eggplant.  Service was beautifully paced and attentive. The feel of the whole restaurant  is welcoming and comfortable. Highly recommended.",

My husband got the pasta trio and didn't like that there was no separation between them and that the sauces all ran together. There was so nothing impressive about any of the the three pastas. They were fresh, but very mediocre. Considering the price point and location, I expect more from Tommy V's.   I am not sure if we will be going back here unfortunately, which is disappointing as it used to be a very good experience.",

Great decision!  We were one of two parties on the patio, which was lovely.  Our server was energetic, attentive, and kind.  I think he kinda read our need for TLC.  We started with the fried burrata, which was served with good olives, prosciutto, and an ok tomato.  We expected the burrata to be hot (it's fried after all) but it was room temp.  I looked it up, and that's how it's done.  I'm apparently a Philistine. For all you other Unhipsters like me, take note: the burrata is NOT hot ;-)  Wifey had a wedge salad, which had great crunch, and what tasted like homemade bleu dressing. Goodgoodgood.  I had the duet of eggplant torta with butternut ravioli. The torta was thinly sliced fried eggplant, stacked,  and sauced. Unctuous! Cinnamon in the ravioli was surprising, and were I Italian, I'd make it at the holidays because it reminded me of pumpkin pie without the sweetness. I totally loved my dinner!  The wine list is very well thought out, with modest to mondo pricing.  Good job, Sommelier!  How much did we like it? Going back again tonight and bringing family.",

For dessert we shared the cannoli and the tiramisu .. both good desserts but nothing amazing .. the cream in the cannoli was slightly gritty and the base layer of the tiramisu was very wet.. flavors on both were good.  On the happy hour menu we enjoyed the prosciutto & fig reduction bruschetta.. and the smoked salmon with capers bruschetta.. both very good.. I really enjoyed the sweet and savory prosciutto &fig reduction .. the arugula added that nice spicy greens flavor to each bite!! Delish!  They have a long drink menu .. the fig mule was refreshing and light..   Staff here is friendly and took great care of us.. even when our stay went from lunch to five hours later into happy hour!!",

I'm in a fitness challenge so I had dietary restrictions, to which they were most accommodating. I had the salad with balsamic vinegar, and it was fresh and tasty. The salmon was prepped without oil, as I requested. The server even kept the potatoes off, because they were drenched in sauce and not clean, how considerate! They were extra steamed veggies, instead. My dessert was berries, no cream. The fruit was fresh and perfect.   I was really bummed I couldn't enjoy the bottle of Jordan Cab with my family, but they swore up and down that it was delicious.   Overall, this place was awesome and I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "Just had dinner at Tommy V's with a work group. It was a good experience although my main entree left something to be desired.  The appetizers- calamari, fried buratta and squash blossoms- all really good- can't say which was better- all hood enough to re-order. The tiramisu was divine- one of the best I have ever had- soft like clouds bursting with amazing flavors... gotta done it! The entree was the chef's special beef ragu on pappardelle & it was meh... no distinct flavor and it had peas- really! My co worker had the short rib with gnocchi and that was waaaaayyyyy better! So pulled the short straw on this :( other than that- service was decent, ambiance and volume were decent. So certainly a solid 4 going on 5 if the entree was better.",

Food was good, servings generous, cocktails meh, but a decent list of wines by the glass.  - Enjoyed the white anchovy starter and the roasted beet salad.  - I had the fish special- large piece of white fish topped with some crab meat. They had run out of escarole, so offered it over sauteed spinach instead. Very good, loaded with buttery garlic sauce.  - Didn't love the eggplant torta (too much breading on soggy eggplant) and the butternut squash ravioli on the side didn't have much flavor.  Overall, decent food with friendly servers in a pretty dining room.",

Of great importance in Oldtown Scottsdale, the restaurant also has its own parking lot. The place was definitely trendy and I saw plenty of young adults/professionals eating here on dates or in groups. And the price is definitely right for a fancy date on a budget.  The food was a little bit of a mixed bag. I got the bruschetta as an appetizer, which said it came only with olive oil. When I got it, it was also drenched in vinegar... a big no-no for me. Even then, the tomatoes seemed just a little unripe (pre-ripe) and the cheese was good, but not memorable. I then had the chicken marsala. It was so... damned... good. I also appreciated how substantial the mushrooms were, they weren't the weak tiny slices you often get with marsala. The sauce was fantastic and yes, I used some bread to get even more. It came with some rigatoni that was, frankly, pretty bad. It also came with cheese despite me specifically confirming with the waiter that there was no cheese on the dish.   Overall, pretty good Italian fare for a reasonable price.",

Helped me figure out what how to order to get what I wanted (which turned out to be Caesar Salad and Asparagus).   The runner was coming with my dinner and Kevin intercepted him to inspect the food first.  He sent the salad back because I had ordered the dressing on the side and the kitchen didn't get the memo.  The salad was very nice, large, and the salmon was incrdible and generously portioned.  The Asparagus appears to have been sauteed in olive oil or avocado oil.  Incredible seasoning.  Best Asparagus ever!  So I dined in a semi formal dining room, impeccably decorated and maintained, enjoyed Caesar Salad with salmon along with the best (and biggest!) plate of Asparagus ever, all cleverly managed by warm and friendly professional server.  Good show!  Here's the kicker.  The bill?  $23.00!  Amazing!",

The food was exceptional, the service is knowledgeable and articulate and we got to meet the owner who obviously loves to bring good food to his customers. We went on a Saturday night just recently. The cocktails are refreshing and very creative. We ordered the specials, Lamb. Delicious, cooked perfectly and seasoned with just the right amount of herbs. We had one flaw, the brussel sprouts were undercooked. That's it,,,only one small issue. But, our waiter alerted the owner, a wonderful man, and he came to our table right away to see what he cold do to make it right. We told him that everything (except the sprouts) was perfect. The food, drinks, service ambiance, we can't complain about one small imperfection. He would not let us pay for our dinners! We told him that we eat out and travel often, we have seldom had such a good meal. There was no way that we  want him to comp our meal. There was really no reason for that. He still insisted and said that he wanted to make sure that we would return on our next visit. How could we not? If you want a great meal in a relaxing yet professional restaurant, this is it!",

Located in the trendy neighborhood of Scottsdale. I selected an entree from the fixed menu which was excellent. I had the Strawberry Field Green Salad with blue cheese, roasted pecans  and balsamic dressing. For my entree I selected the grilled salmon with whipped potatoes and grilled brussel sprouts. (The brussel sprouts were a substitute for the green beans @ my request.) The salmon was cooked perfect and a generous portion. The brussel sprouts were just a little under cooked but still enjoyable. I might suggest that the chef try steaming them prior to the grill. Allowing for them to become a tender. Also try experimenting with maybe a peach, apricot, maple or bacon glaze. Just to give them a little more of a WOW factor. For dessert I selected the salted carmel Gelato which was outstanding. My only suggestion would be for the chef to use a hand whipped cream garnish. A restaurant of this level should never use a whipped cream from the can. Otherwise,  I would definitely recommend the restaurant and would definitely visit again.",

My husband made a reservation, and we were really looking forward to eating at Tommy V's.  I pulled into the parking lot and when we got out of the car, the owner or manager yelled at us not to park there.  He said the parking was only for Tommy V's customers.  I said we were on our way to eat there.  I think he assumed that since we were looking for the entrance that we were just going to park and walk around in the surrounding area.  Honest mistake right?  Sure, I get it.  But he didn't apologize, and he didn't just drop it.  So by the time we got up to the hostess stand, and we could still hear him talking about us, we just turned around and left.   The menu online looked great.  As I said, we were really looking forward to eating at this restaurant.  Instead we went and had an amazing dinner at Modern Steak where the staff were all welcoming and friendly.

Definitely a great place to meet some friends or bring a date.  The food though was lackluster.  We started out with the calamari, which had good breading, but was overcooked.  Actually, either overcooked, or they weren't using fresh ingredients.  I also had the pasta trio, which was alright, but not the mind blowing experience I was expecting from the reviews.  The wild mushroom ravioli was good, but I didn't care much for the other two types of pasta.  My friend had the Cioppino which was on special, and that looked pretty good.  I'll probably stay away from this place.",

The dessert -- lemon almond torte -- was to die for. All the ladies at my table (myself included) also ordered the peach margaritas, which were really tasty. The service was great throughout the evening, and our waitress handled our party of nine with ease. The only complaint I have about the evening was the inside temperature -- it was freezing! We ended up leaving earlier than we would have liked because of it. I saw a review earlier complaining that the restaurant was too hot. Maybe there's some sort of insulation issue? Anyway, temperature aside, it was a great experience, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the area.",

We started off with the Prince Edward Island Mussels, the Chef's Board and the MUST GET Crisp Pancetta Wrapped Prawns...all great! The Chef's Board was fantastic and great starter for a group to share. If you are only a few do not pass on the Prawns they were so AMAZING! We ordered a couple salads to share, the Pear Baby Greens was my favorite. We also shared a few entrees...the Pan Seared Diver Scallops - delicious! and the Citrus Shrimp & Lobster Ravioli...the ravioli was to die for! The service was spectacular, our server was a sweet heart and took photos of our Girls Night Out for us, he was very knowledgeable on the wines and recommended just the right things.

Bolognese sauce was great but too much sauce on the pasta.  Could  not taste the organic pasta because there was so much sauce.  The sauce should compliment the pasta.  Not overwhelm the pasta.  The clam linguine was oily and did not have a great clam flavor. Service was good but it was not busy.  The prices were not bad.  $80 with tip for two.  Not sure what other options there are for Italian.  The name \"Urban Bar\" I think is more for the style of the decor and not for the food.   Good meal but not great.",

Owned and run by non-Italians. Just putting a few pics of Sophia Loren and old blue eyes doesn't make it  Italian.  And MORE is not necessarily BETTER. The apps were unusual and way too much on the plates. Some just didn't make any sense. The Orrichetti could have been enjoyed but there was way too much served and the  vodka sauce was fairly tasteless. Owner was there and was cordial.  Not like the Tommy V's in Carlsbad CA",

I was hungry and thirsty, so I ordered two apps, the short rib sliders and roasted butternut squash ravioli w/ brown butter sage sauce, and a glass of their white wine blend, which had a bit of moscato in it.  Everything was very good!  I'd order all three again, most definitely.  Especially the ravioli and the glass of white blend.  :D  Hmm...

    "text": "Had dinner here this past Monday (11/23) with some of my staff members to celebrate my boss's Birthday. I couldn't get the server's name, but she had long dark hair tied in a pony tail and has what most people would consider an unhappy face. Absolutely an unpleasant gal to even talk to. The moment you responded back to an attitude that was given, she tried to pull that reverse psychology role and make it seem like.... \"I'm sorry but I have no idea what you are talking about\"   At the beginning of service, my boyfriend and I had simply asked and requested for our meal to be on a separate check as we felt it was uncomfortable to have the Birthday man pay for our dinner. Just a simple request... She had said Gary (my boss) had already pre-authorized his card and she cannot do that. What is this.... A club? We had asked and simply requested something as simply as that and she challenged every single bit of it. Finally said she would, and needless to say she came back at the end of dinner and said she couldn't do it because her boss told her she couldn't. What planet do you live on when someone ask you, \"please put my dinner on a separate tab because today is the boss's birthday, and we do not feel completely comfortable with him taking care of our meal.\"   I totally get that my boss wants to take care of our staff, but when another person or I should say two people show up to surprise and wish him a happy birthday, it is uncomfortable and awkward that he ends up paying for our meal. I'm extremely disappointed that something as simple as that was challenged. She made it so much more difficult than it had to be... Come on girl... This isn't rocket science!   I think a lot of people lack the understanding of human communication, and maybe I should've signed for her. Worst part is, the manager/owner Zorn never even touched the table. For as dead of a place it was you would've at least thought the owner would come over to greet and check on one of the only tables that gave him business that evening. This is suppose to be a quality restaurant with quality service. I give Monday night's visit an, eh!   Tommy V's might be a good-looking restaurant but it is slowly declining for sure. Nothing good going on here! Drive a little further up North to Local Bistro and see the difference in Service and food. That place is on point!",

It wouldn't finish in first place but it definitely wouldn't be last either.  This place has some really good food.  I'm from the northeast and I judge every Italian restaurant for how well it executes linguine with clams (aka vongole or whatever else you may call it). While I must admit that it is my favorite dish, the simplicity of it allows you to truly taste the flavors of the pasta and sauce.    I really enjoyed the dish at Tommy V's.  Clams were great! The pasta was cooked to slight perfection and the sauce was very tasty (albeit just a tad bitter if I'm being extremely nitpicky).    Good wine selection and happy hour specials.  They had 10 different wines available for $5 during happy hour.  Service was excellent.  Owner walked around frequently too to ensure we were enjoying the meal.  Definitely check it out!",

I took it home and got two more meals out of it.    Tommy V's has a full bar and happily for me, they know how to make a good Manhattan.

However, they do have a parking lot dedicated to customers, so you would likely get right in.  We did.  I recommend Tommy V's and believe you will have a nice meal and dining experience.",

I absolutely loved our server. I could have hated the food and I still would have rated 5 Stars based on my server. I wish I could remember his name. every time we had a question about something or needed a suggestion he knew just what to offer. That means drinks all the way down to the food. All in all he probably got me to spend a good twenty bucks more than I would have LOL great job  that being said, the food did not disappoint. This is not a cheap place but worth every penny. I want to come back and explore more of the menu.",

I love the bolognese but have to say that recently the eggplant torte has been my go-to dish. And, while I am not one to order dessert, the chocolate cake is amazing. This has become our go-to restaurant. And, parking couldn't be better with their private lot. I would highly recommend Tommy V's for a quick casual meal or a night out with friends.",

It's gorgeous, and although it's not something out of an IKEA catalog, it's modern and new enough that it's clearly had some attention and money put into the space.  But there's also something so very old school. They're not pushing that. They're not milking that. It just has an old school feel to it. Like when you're hanging out with your grandfather and he's rocking a pair of Chuck Taylors and you're like, oh, he's so modern. And then he tells you some terribly off color joke and you're like, oh, okay, there's the old school.  Feeling and vibe aside, they handled out group like champs. I needed pasta, and pasta I got. Bucatini in red sauce. After one bit I managed to get the dreaded red spot on my recently pressed shirt, so you know it's good Italian.  Look at the steaks, though. This isn't standout standalone Italian, so feel free to look around the menu and get what sounds best; you aren't beholden to the mother country.  Kudos to the staff for walking us through the options and providing lots of recommendations.",

    "text": "Tommy V's is old school Italian eats in an upscale atmosphere. They're not reinventing the wheel here. It's a menu full of dishes any Italian cuisine enthusiast with love, all made and served up with care.   I came in with a work group for dinner and they split us between two large tables. We started off with a couple appetizers, including what I considered to the highlight of the meal, a super fresh mozzarella caprese with tomatoes, basil and an addictive balsamic drizzle. If the meal ended there, I would have left content with no complaints.   Fortunately it continued. The service was great from start to finish. I originally was feeling like some classic spaghetti and meatballs but my server talked me into the fettuccine bolognese, saying it was the better of the two dishes. Whether that is True should be determined on my next visit, but I will say the bolognese was a big bowl of flavorful comfort food that stuck to my ribs and kept me from eating breakfast the next morning. I also tried a bite of my coworkers filet mignon. Wasn't as impressed with the flavor there.  Good Italian restaurants are hard to find. If I lived in Phoenix, this would be a top recommendation or date spot for me. If I visit, I'm coming back.",

The service was great and they were able to accommodate our large party of 20, which is hard to find in Old Town Scottsdale. We were split into two tables but this was totally ok with us.  We started with their calamari, charcuterie board (LOVED the pickled veggies on it), and Caprese salad. We also enjoyed their fresh bread with EVOO & balsamic (one of my major guilty pleasures in life!). All apps were definitely tasty.  For my entree, I ordered their chicken piccata and it was yummy. A little more rich and creamy that I usually like (i'm all about the thin sauces, with an extra lemony flair) but the portion was HUGE and it definitely satisfied my piccata craving. Gimme all the capers, please! It came with TWO thin chicken breasts, veggies, and pasta. Yum.  All in all, I would most definitely recommend Tommy V's to friends looking for an Italian fix in the area! It is dimly lit and romantic - perfect for a date night or special occasion.",

Warm complimentary bread was served at the beginning of the meal.  Bellini: Nice mixture of peach puree and prosecco. Probably one of the better bellinis I've had.  Fettuccini: Comes with 3 different meat sauces-veal, beef, and pork. The pasta was okay. I think this plate may be too much of a good thing. I thought the 3 different meats would be great all in one pasta, but I honestly would have been satisfied with just one.  Short Ribs: My bf had this and said it was delicious. It comes with a side of spinach & asiago gnocchi. I stole a few bites of the gnocchi and really enjoyed them.  Overall, we all enjoyed each others company and the drinks were definitely flowing all throughout our meal. Will I be back? Most likely not. Not because of the food or service, but because there are just too many other restaurants nearby that I would like to try.",

If you do see it as an option on a visit here do yourself a favor and give the rest of your group that order envy I get so often.   Outside of this incredible dish, Tommy V's totally brings it.

I loved my steak, which I split with a coworker in exchange for some of his shrimp and lobster pasta. I'm not going to lie, I barely touched that pasta because even half of the steak was a massive helping. When I asked the server he told me that the menu often underestimates the size of the steak and customers are always blown away by the size of the New York. Sure, it was big, but the cook on the meat was perfect and it definitely exceeded my expectations, especially for an Italian restaurant.   Thanks for hosting us, Tommy V's, and we're damn lucky the restaurant was near empty (except for us) as we're a wild bunch. You're some seriously patient people. Thank you!",

    "text": "Jimmy and I came here for dinner a few weeks back. The food was pretty delicious, but it was the service that really stood out.  Food: Prince Edward Island Mussels - Butter, garlic, wine sauce plus mussles and crostini. How can you go wrong? Quite delectable. I had the Pasta Trio which has a sampling of the mushroom tortelli (excellent sauce!), spinach ricotta ravioli, and my favorite, the brie, asiago, brown butter gnocchi. (1 each of the tortelli and ravioli, and 5 or 6 gnocchi). J had the NY Steak which was covered in caramelized fennel, stewed tomatoes, and mascarpone cheese. His steak was ok, but I'm a minimalist when it comes to meat. I think the less toppings, the better. His steak had way too many flavors going on for my taste. He liked it though.  Anyway...the service. For whatever reason, this was our first meal of the day (...it was 7:30pm), and both of us were very hungry. So when my food came, J was in shock as to how little of a plate it was and whether or not I would be content with just that. He asked our waitress to bring over a menu so we could look to order another appetizer. Within minutes of her bringing the menu, the manager (I believe he was the manager - I could be wrong, he might be the owner) comes over and wants to know if there's something wrong or if there's anything he can do. J explains that he did not realize the portion would be so little for my pasta and how he thinks I need to eat more food (which granted, I did), so he wants to order another appetizer. The manager/owner cuts in saying he would gladly get me more of whichever pasta I liked the best (with no additional charge), because he did not want anyone leaving unsatisfied with their meal. I picked the gnocchi and within a few minutes, a bowl of additional gnocchi was brought out to me. Hot, delicious, and tasty. And not to mention, the right amount for me to be content with my meal.  The manager/owner came by again towards the end of our meal just to check up on things, and proceeded to chat it up with J about how he should come check out their bar area, where you can also order from the main menu, but still catch whatever game is on. I'm sure J will be returning for HH one of these days.  I've eaten at many restaurants like this one, where the serving sizes are rather small, but I've come to accept that's just how these \"trendy\" types of restaurants are, and there's no getting around that. But rather than make the elaborate explanation/justification for why servings are so small, the manager/owner instead provided excellent customer service, which both of us found to be very refreshing.",

Their gnocchi was delicious as well! But what I absolutely enjoyed with their SERVICE!! It was a 10 star service that exceed above and beyond the expectations of even the restaurant each self. Our server even offered to switch out any plates we didn't like since it was our first time there. Their decor was a very warm dining room kind of feeling - dim lights, dark cherrywood tables and chairs. I'ld go back just to be treated like a princess!",

Tommy V's was directly across the street from our hotel and was convenient to our needs so that's how we choose Tommy V's. I got to tell you this place has got some of the best service I have ever had, and that is a hard rating to get from me considering how I was feeling that night. Everything was cooked to perfection, had wonderful flavor. I can tell you that we did not make it easy on them either, my wife and I split everything during this meal and they split everything to perfection and without complaint. This place went above and beyond to accommodate us, I went from beyond grumpy to relaxed and pleased when we left. My wife and I split the the Pasta Trio and a Romaine Wedge salad, everything came on two separate plates and and I am sure they bumped up the portions sizes to accommodate us splitting the plates. The Pasta Trio had wonderful flavor and texture, the wild mushroom ravioli was my favorite. They had a fantastic little jazz band trio playing, I just fell in love with this place, lots of room, not too load, great ambiance, and fantastic service.",

    "text": "I came here with my husband and parents to celebrate my birthday.  We arrived a little earlier than our reservation time, but the restaurant was not busy at all yet, so they seated us promptly.  We started with the Crostino Di Proscuitto and the Fried Calamari.  The Crostino was just okay - I felt like I could have done a better job making it at home.  The calamari was good - they were not overbreaded and had a nice light fry to make the batter crunchy, but not make the calamari rubbery. My family members then ordered the veal, pasta trio, and eggplant torta with butternut squash ravioli.  Everyone seemed to like their meal.  I had a bite of the butternut squash ravioli and thought it was really tasty.  I had ordered a sea bass, which was unfortunately not a good piece of fish.  After my first bite I knew it was a piece of bad fish, and was not about to eat the rest and be sick on my birthday.  The lentil side that came with the fish was AMAZING, so it was unfortunate to get such a bad piece of fish.  However, as soon as the chef was notified that I had received some bad fish, he came out personally, took it away, apologized and discussed what I would like as a replacement.  I ended up not wanting to chance another piece of fish, so I ordered the hazelnut risotto.  It was really great, and I have no complaints about it and would order it again in a heartbeat!  The chef came out after that and checked on us repeatedly to make sure we were all satisfied with our meals.  He also went above and beyond and served us all with a 4 course sampling of desserts, which was a wonderful birthday treat and his way of apologizing for the fish.  The staff was great and I appreciated the the chef was so dedicated to making it a good birthday for me. I will definitely be back to try out some more of Tommy V's offerings.",

Fortunately, we have  found Tommy V's Urban Kitchen!  We've eaten there twice (plan on going back many more times) & love everything about the place.  The food is fantastic; the staff is friendly, professional & efficient; the restaurant is pretty; & the owner is very hands-on & makes himself accessible & known-- a delightfully friendly man!  When last there, my husband experienced a minor health issue & the quick action & genuine concern for my husband & myself was amazing!!  Unfortunately, paramedics needed to be called, but everyone at Tommy V's made sure to keep the incident low-key, so as to not upset the other diners & to insure we had our privacy & all our needs taken care of.  The whole incident was handled like a well orchestrated play.  Our continued thanks to Zoran & his entire staff for taking such compassionate care of us that night.  If you like VERY good Italian food, please try this place & be sure to tell your friends. I hope your evening contains less drama than ours did, and that you leave as anxious to return as we are.",

Not all helpful  The Chicken Parm was a bleached out piece of bagged, frozen  Costco chicken, microwaved and covered in a bland herb tomato sauce that was so far from authentic even the most basic jar of sauce would have tasted better.  The chicken was like chewing on a piece of rubber.  The sauce lacked any flavour. The pasta had obviously sat in a pot for hours before running hot water over to heat it.  I asked for additional Parm cheese.  The waiter grabbed a bowl from the another table, he sprinkled it on only to find out it was  not real cheese, but the Kraft out of tin type made to look authentic by putting it in a bowl.   The waiter was somewhat impatient when we needed a bit more time to order. The lighting on the patio was horrible...one tea light at the table! The patio is essentially in the parking lot...as we were eating dinner, a car was shining its lights in our eyes...(at least we could see the menu).  My husband order the pan seared Mahi Mahi and you seriously couldn' t if it was chicken or pork but it definitely didn't taste like fish AT ALL (in the good sense).    Don't waste your money....a beer, a glass of white wine and two entrees $70 and it was not worth a single penny.  In a town where there is no shortage of fine restaurants at reasonable prices, this one needs to close its doors.",

    "text": "We were visiting Arizona and were looking for a place to eat on a Sunday night. We decided to check yelp to see what was good. This place obviously had great reviews, and was open on Sunday, so we decided to check it out.  I called and made a reservation for 9:30 pm. When we got there the place was basically empty, which wasn't that surprising for how late our reservation was and that it was Sunday, but we were greeted very enthusiastically and told we would have the best table in the house. We laughed about it since we were the only ones there.  As far as the food went, it was very good. We had the calamari for an appetizer. It was good, if I had a critique for it, it would be that the batter tasted a little over seasoned for my taste, but really was very good overall. My husband ordered short ribs, which he loved, but I didn't try them. I ordered the diver scallops which were amazing! I almost never finish a full portion for dinner, but these were so good I had to. Perfectly cooked, big, and topped with cheese. With a little pasta on the side.   The the thing that really stood out about this restaurant for us though was the service. You would expect it to be good, because the place was empty, but the staff really went out of their way to make it an EXCELLENT experience for us. As an ex-server myself, I know when people walk in at the end of the night, it can be frustrating and its easy to kind of just get by with the bare minimum, but that wasn't the case here.  Our server Chris was amazing. He was friendly, witty, and very informative. He knew everything about each dish. When we asked about the restaurant he gave us the history, told us about the owners, and said he had been there since it opened and he loved it. He was very attentive all night. Then there was Jenn, she was the bartender and was at the bar across from the restaurant from us. When I couldn't decided what type of wine I wanted with my meal. She came to our table with samples of the two I was debating over. She told me where they were from, about their flavors, and what they paired well with. She even gave me a very generous portion of one that was the \"end of the bottle\" but if you ask me it probably could have been split between two glasses. I began to feel like I was at a wine tasting, as Jenn kept having suggestions for me or things I should try. But not at all pushing me to try things I didn't want or spending too much time at the table. At the end of our dinner, she even sent us over a desert wine.   Overall the food and place were very nice. But it was the outstanding service that really made an unforgettable experience! Cant wait to visit again!",

I was looking for a restaurant last minute to host a large group for a birthday party, I called and spoke to Zoran (owner/chef) and he was willing to work with me to accommodate! He worked to custom make a set menu for my party  and reserve a private area of the restaurant.  He was a True  pleasure to work with.   Every part of our five course meal was amazing! The food and the staff / service could not have been better! We had approximately 20 people and everyone walked away saying how much they enjoyed their experience and the food. We will definitely be back and he gained a lot more customers too!   Overall, great food and great service..... Go eat there!!!",

The acoustics aren't the best, and it can get pretty loud, but my friend and I had the time and space to have a long, leisurely conversation over some delicious food.  Though we were there for two hours (by choice) we never felt pressure to move on, and we had excellent service the whole time!  I had the beef carpaccio and the risotto with artichokes off the happy hour menu, and both were excellent.  And the portions were perfect for me - the carpaccio could have been shared with one other person if you were also getting a salad, soup, or another appetizer.  And the risotto was served in a 6-7\" soup bowl type of presentation - just the right size for a light meal.  It was filled with vegetables and big pieces of tender baby artichoke, and left me perfectly satisfied.  They even have gluten-free spaghetti and penne pasta - I'm definitely going back for that (and the lobster bisque!)",

Ordered fried calamari, which was good, a bit chewy for my liking and served with a marinara sauce. For entree I ordered braised short rib with spinach gnocchi and my boyfriend ordered the scallops. Short rib was good but my only issue with the dish was that it was two decent size portions of meat served with six tiny pieces of gnocchi on a plate of gravy. I ate one piece of the short rib with my gnocchi, which went pretty quickly..and then left with one chunk of meat and nothing else to eat with it. The dish needs something else or more gnocchi. My boyfriend liked the scallops. All in all everything was good. But not great.",

The Bucatini Amatriciana was outstanding.  All the pasta's are organic and homemake.  We finished the evening with cannoli where were freshly made and very good.

They offer a nice selection of wines by the glass for $5 each. We decided to try an ample selection of appetizers to share to get a good feel for the menu. We had the Kobe sliders, the salmon bruschetta, the pulled pork sliders, the fig jam & ricotta sliders, the Cesar salad, and the artichoke orzo. The portion sizes were perfect and I can't say enough good things about the presentation! And the taste...unbelievably good, like too good to be True good! We finished with a delightfully light tiramisu. Quality all the way around, by far exceeded our expectations, we will definitely be back. The service was on par with our meal and flawless as well. The server was attentive and witty, and the manager (owner?) took time to introduce himself and inquire about our experience. If you haven't been, you MUST try it!",

Nice ambience and so do have to say the general manager was very nice as well... just not good enough food to go back. :-(",

Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly, and gave excellent recommendations (he kind of reminded me of an adult \"Manny\" from Modern Family ~ so I took an instant liking to him)!  I enjoyed my Prosecco with the Burrata Caponata, Prosciutto, House-Cured Olives.  Seriously - when is Burrata ever wrong?  Delish!   I was also excited to see the Goat Cheese & Basil Stuffed Squash Blossoms on the menu and ordered those as well.  My only complaint was that they were deep fried - I thought that a light tempura would have been better to enhance the flavors and the presentation.    Our friends ordered The Chef Board Artisan Meats and Cheeses, Olives, Grilled Artichoke, Caponata this was excellent and enough for 4 people to share.  The Pork Oso Buco Tomato Wine Sauce, was also a hit!  My favorite of the night was the Mushroom Hazelnut Risotto.  It was so good and SO rich that I could not finish it!    We ended our evening with one of the owners bringing us some complimentary Guapa and limoncello shots.  This complimented our tiramisu dessert!  Also - check out the happy hour menu!  I will definitely be going back!",

    "text": "Arizona Restaurant Week is something we look forward to twice a year. It gives us a chance to sample the cuisine of places we have not been. This week we tried Tommy V's. We made reservations for 7:30 on a Wednesday night and when we arrived, the place was practically deserted. We were shown to a tiny table for 2 and we asked to be seated at a slightly larger table (my hubby is a big guy!) With only 3 other tables in the entire place full, I didn't think that was too much to ask. We were given the menus and after discussion, decided to chose from the regular menu. Not that the restaurant week menu wasn't fine, we just saw things we wanted on the other menu. However, one of the appetizers (the crab cakes) was not on the regular menu, so I asked if I could have those if I wasn't choosing the special menu. After some brief confusion on the part of the waiter, he said yes.  The first course arrived and the crab cake (not 'cakes' as written in the menu) was fine. My husband had the lettuce wedge salad which he said was delicious! It looked great too, not a huge slab of iceberg like many. For entrees I had the shrimp risotto, which was really great with huge lovely grilled shrimp and risotto cooked perfectly. Nicely seasoned and a very generous portion. Hubby had the Tommy V's pasta trio which he said was 'amazingly good' and when I took a bite I would agree. He had gin and tonics and I had the Ruffino Chianti (one of my favs with Italian food.) Overall I would give the food an A-. Service was a little slow, but our server was charming and friendly and we weren't in a rush.  The most interesting thing about the evening was something my H pointed out: he was the ONLY male customer in the place! All the other tables were groups of women!  We would definitely go back, and I would like to try lunch there...and maybe a happy hour.",

The wait staff is eager to please and the restaurant in a great location in old Town Scottsdale. Our waiter Efren helped us with our selections and the pasta trio was delicious. Husband had the special, a homemade canneloni that was amazingly light and delicious. We had a nice bottle of wine and appreciated the time given to choose our wine and dinner. The bread was delicious with virgin olive oil or dipping. The entree size was ample and plenty for us but not huge. I would have appreciated a bit more time before the entree arrived. Next time I will ask if we could enjoy our wine and hold the dinner for a bit. Will definitely visit again on our next trip.",

I'm only giving four stars because my scallops were overcooked, BUT our server (and trainee with him) didn't hesitate for a second to bring out new, deliciously cooked scallops to replace the chewy ones once I politely expressed my concern. That is fabulous customer service! I would do five stars for service but four stars for food since I did have to get new scallops...Great atmosphere  and ambiance as well. I will definitely be returning. They earned a repeat customer :-)",

I wasn't very hungy, so he suggested the beet salad with goat cheese.  It was excellent, as was the bread they served with olive oil.  The cocktails and wine were reasonable and delicious, and the owner served us all complimentary guapa after dinner and came over to thank us for coming in.  We had a conversation on the patio afterwards, and he was clearly passionate about good food and scottsdale, and I'm thankful that he has moved into the neighborhood.  Will definitely return for dinner with the BF.",

We to dinner earlier and wish we had known there was a quartet playing in the lounge area.  We would have sat on that side of the restaurant.  The restaurant is attractive and well designed.  The assistant staff were polite, and kept our table very happy with additional bread and wine.  We were a table of 4.  I had the eggplant Torte and can't rave enough about it.  Even if you didn't like eggplant, this would make you a believer with the delicious creamy tomato sauce.  My Husband had a risotto that was cooked perfectly.  The other friends both had pasta with a wonderful pomodora sauce with tomatoes and fresh basil.  Decent portions and we all were impressed.  We are locals but if you are visiting, or local, don't pass this restaurant by.  You'll be pleased!  And another positive thing is that they have their own parking lot!!!  And one other thing I forgot to mention!  When the weather is beautiful, they have a terrific patio for outdoor dining!",

They have a full menu for happy hour which runs most days from 11:30-6:30 and an outstanding wine list, many of these wines are on special for $5 during the happy time.  The menu itself had so many choices it was hard to decide on what to order.  We ended up with Rigatoni chicken that I had to come back for with a second visit, and we also ordered the manchego sandwich, recommended by our waiter.  They have a nice seating area at the bar, and also an outdoor patio.  They have only been open 3 months but this one is a  winner with outstanding food and reasonable prices!!",

I've been critical of Italian restaurants out here but my wife and I were very pleased of our entire experience. Service and ambience were great. Food was spectacular and prices were very affordable. Eggplant torta was fantastic and fried burrata appetizer hit the spot! Lemoncello sorbet for desert was the perfect ending to a great meal.

    "text": "We had a great dining experience here and will definitely be back to try out some of the other items on the menu.  We stopped in on a Tuesday night and despite the fact that the place was nowhere near full, the bar area seemed a bit loud so we asked to be seated on the other side of the restaurant where things were a bit quieter.  We started off with the lobster bisque, which is one of the better lobster bisques that I've had.  It wasn't overly creamy and the addition of sherry added a nice flavor.  It's certainly pleasing to find that there are in fact actual pieces of lobster in the bisque rather than just an overall seafood flavor.  For our entrees, I ordered the pasta trio which consisted of wild mushroom tortelli, spinach ricotta truffle ravioli and gnocchi with brie, asiago, and a brown butter sage sauce.  The tortelli was my favorite of the three items, however, all of them were made with high quality ingredients and were made in a True Italian style.  I would have preferred if the sauces were more flavorful, but even as is, the items were still good.  My husband had the eggplant torta with butternut squash ravioli and of course, I had to sample both items on his plate as well.  I really didn't care for the butternut squash ravioli as there was an overwhelming taste of brown sugar, but the eggplant torta was my favorite of anything we'd ordered.  It was served more as an eggplant lasagna than a typical torta and the flavors were excellent.  The eggplant was tender but not mushy and the sauce and cheeses were wonderful.    The service was excellent and the owner introduced himself and was very friendly throughout the meal.  The wine list also offered many good options at a variety of price points.  This place was a great find and we'll be back soon to enjoy more of the menu.",

I've tried most of the happy hour appetizers and they're all cooked (or raw) to perfection. Glad to see a quality restaurant in this troubled location.   I give the place 5 stars despite the service which can be spotty at times, but I understand it's a brand new restaurant so they'll eventually work out the kinks. Still: servers need to be a little less familiar, a little more professional with guests...and even though it's an Italian place and very friendly, the repeated touching of guests' shoulders/backs when talking to them is a little offputting. Other than that minor hiccup, I highly recommend this place.",

Immediately after being sat three servers came up with silverware, plates and a lantern with a lit candle in it for a cute ambiance. The server, Tyler, was more than helpful and quick, apologizing when he thought he took too long which actually never was long at all. The food was amazing, from the balsamic and olive oil mixture for the bread to the amazing pasta and chicken Parmesan. We left the place in a relaxed, happy mood and a full stomach. I can't wait to go back and try more items.",

My husband ordered the halibut and was very impressed because we all know how hard it is to cook fish without overdoing it. It was light, flaky, and moist. Very tasty too. Dessert was a canoli. It was what you'd expect with a good cream inside. Just the right size to finish off the meal.  One thing to note is that they have a full espresso bar which is something we don't see everyday!   The one and only reason for 4 stars was that our waiter seemed a little distracted or maybe he was newer? He was hard to hear and he was a bit slow getting me tea refills whereas the water was refilled before it was even empty  (someone else was doing that for my husband). All in all... definitely would come back!!!   Honestly it's hard for me to walk away with this great of feeling from a meal and restaurant. Often I feel like I can do a better job myself.",

Five stars across the board for location, ambiance, service, and food  // LOCATION // Downtown Scottsdale  // SERVICE // Top Notch. Hernand was the waiter for our party and seeing +10 hungry patrons did not faze him one bit. He was on point with everything and even had time to crack jokes and be our photographer for the evening. When our friend asked to pack up some of the table bread we had left over, the waiters whisked away the bread baskets and instead wrapped up a fresh loaf and a huge container full of butter for her to take home. Service was perfect perfect perfect.  // FOOD //       + Homemade Pasta Trio: One of my fave pasta dishes ever.          -Mushroom tortelli: I love mushrooms in my pasta and this sauce was in an amazing savory sauce          -Spinach and ricotta ravioli: Amazing, especially b/c I'm a sucker for veggie ravioli.          -Gnocchi: Soft, plump, and delish  Amazing dining experience in our intimate private dining room.

Recommended dishes from that evening were pasta picchio pacchio, shrimp with risotto, eggplant parmesan, and chicken marsala. Patrick also made wine recommendations that we liked very much.

    "text": "We went here on Friday based on a craving I had for steak. The host at the front threw me off a bit by just saying, \"hi\", and nothing else after I replied, \"hello\", so after a moment I asked for a table for two outside. He hemmed and hawed as if this were an unusual request, and then went out to look (even though you could see through the floor to ceiling windows that it was practically empty), and then came back and seated us outside. The waiter came and took drink orders. Their Mediterranean fig mule was very good. We ordered a starter salad and carpaccio, which were both tasty and generous helping sizes. I ordered the NY strip steak and my bf ordered the risotto. It took us awhile to finish the first course, so when the waiter brought out the entrees immediately after clearing our salad plates I figured they'd probably been under a heat lamp for a bit. The food was lukewarm, the steak was chewy and overcooked (I'd say medium well when I asked for medium rare) and wayyyy too salty, and I like salty. The potatoes, in contrast, were undercooked and under salted. I didn't try the side salad since I'd just had one as a first course. The risotto was meh. Not great, but not bad. We ordered the chocolate cake with ice cream for dessert. The cake was dry and un-memorable. The real kicker though came the next day when I went to eat the side salad I'd taken home and there was TRASH in it! So disgusting! It looked like the corner piece of a bag precut salad. Don't waste your money at this place unless all you care about is eating at a fancy looking place. The 2 stars are for the good drink and decent started salad and carpaccio. Zero stars for everything else.",

That is to be expected at that time on a weekday, and it filled up pretty quickly. The service was impeccable! Our waiter as attentive without being obtrusive, and actually listened to us. I have a severe gluten allergy, and he seemed to truly understand how to manage that. They do have gluten free pasta - spaghetti or penne. I had the GF pasta substituted in the Spaghetti & Meatballs, which was absolutely fantastic! Hubby had Chicken Piccata, which he said was also good (4/5 he says). The merlot he had was very good as well. The kitchen paid attention to my allergy as well, because I had no contamination symptoms afterward (usually have some issues after eating out - the price I pay for not having to cook for myself). The excellent service was what made it a great experience though! We will be back!",

The pan seared salmon was really nothing special and the flavors in the accompanying risotto were inconsistent, like one bite was great, the next bland.  My husband ordered the osso bucco, but there was so much sauce the risotto was more like a soup.  I might not have dinged a star if it weren't for a hostess that seats the only four parties in an otherwise empty restaurant right next to each other.  I don't get it.  But I do love their short rib grilled cheese and the risotto carbonara among other things.  Still one of my favorite places.",

The worst part was the food. The Chefs Board appetizer advertised a chef's selection of meats and cheeses, but  turned out to be a grocery store sampler. The beet salad was really a mixed greens salad with a side of depressed beets; hardly enough to name the salad after it. The chopped salad had the same dressing as the beet salad, wasn't chopped, and was poorly constructed. The \"Housemade organic pasta\" selections sounded excellent, but one dish was worst than the next. The shrimp risotto featured dried shrimp on top of overly-peppered, dried out risotto. The chef's trio of pasta was mediocre. Had to pass on dessert given our experience so far.  I Yelp a lot, but dont write many reviews. I spent two days in the Phoenix area, and looked up all of my dining choices on Yelp. I went to The Arrogant Butcher downtown for dinner(fantastic) and Vovomeena for brunch(also fantastic). This place, however, does not deserve 4 1/2 stars. I wish I had my $90 back.",

    "text": "This is one of those restaurant ratings that makes me question the palate of some yelpers.  I'm quite the food snob, and a bit of an amateur gourmet cook (make my own pastas/sauces/breads/ice creams), so if I eat out, the food should best my abilities in some way.  This place simply did not live up to anything near its 5 star yelp rating in any dimension other than its excellent service.  Let me say that again:  Service was excellent.  Waitstaff was very attentive, and the owner was extremely friendly as well.  5 stars for this part of the experience.  Now the food.  The prices struck me as being too low for the area.  $26 for filet/$17 for homemade pasta seemed cheap to my eyes for dinner.  Turns out I was right.  I'd bet a fair amount of $$ that this place started with the best intentions and good quality ingredients, but the owner has cut prices and ingredient quality because he cannot figure out what's wrong with the restaurant given such high yelp reviews but poor customer turnout (Place was very quiet on a Saturday night at 8pm in spite of a great jazz band.).    Case in point:  my girlfriend's filet was nowhere near a USDA prime or even a choice cut.  I'd guess it was a select cut or a 'no roll' piece of meat similar to what's used at a chain steakhouse.  On top of that, the steak wasn't seasoned at all--no salt or fresh pepper.  It was dreadful.  I ordered the citrus \"prawns\" and lobster ravioli.  The prawns were clearly shrimp, and not even big shrimp:  I'd guess they were 15/20 shrimp at best; nowhere near 10/15 shrimp, and they were definitely not prawns.  Shrimp were also overcooked and flavorless and were cooked via boiling water rather than seared a la minute.  Ravioli texture was great, but filling was mediocre.  Sauce was OK, but didn't seem to be thickened via a typical method (butter or cream).  My guess is that the sauces are premade in the morning and they found butter-thickened sauces would break on them.  Calamari appetizer was not seasoned, was bland, and overcooked.  Calamari were chewy and the tomato sauce served to accompany it was meh.  All in all, the relatively cheap food prices + poor quality of ingredients + shrimp masquerading as \"prawns\" in my dish convinced me the owner probably started with very high ingredient quality and higher prices, but has lowered his price point and ingredient quality to try to spur demand.  I'm guessing he didn't do well, though, even with the best ingredients because the chef in the kitchen clearly isn't the best and doesn't know how to season food.  Nothing I ate had even a modicum of salt on it.  If the owner fired the chef and brought in someone new, raised the prices and the ingredient quality, he'd have a winning establishment.  I only hope he reads this review because it's clear he's trying his best, is a very affable fellow, and I genuinely want him to succeed.",

The overall flavor of the greens was good but it didn't catch my attention.   The chicken piccata was a thicker breast than I prefer. I'd rather it be pounded thinner, and came with a side of pasta in a marinara-type sauce. Again, it didn't make me want to have it again.   My partner had the bruschetta with prosciutto as her appetizer. She liked it and offered me a bite. It reminded me of a bacon sandwich, which was interesting, but again didn't inspire me to return and order it for myself.   All in all, I thought it was so-so. I have places I like better and think I'll be visiting them instead of returning for a next time.",

This past weekend I decided to celebrate my birthday with a large group of friends at Tommy V's, and the restaurant was fantastic to us.  They have a large room at the back of the restaurant for large groups, which is where we were seated on saturday.  I love the room because there is curtain that closes it off from the rest of the restaurant, which provides a nice level of privacy.  When I walked to my table, I noticed that they printed out personalized menus for me, wishing me happy birthday!  I have never had that done for me before, and it was such a great gesture, made it instantly special for me.  As always the food was fantastic, and all my friends enjoyed their meals.  The service though, was impeccable.  The waiter was charismatic, and accommodating to my friends, even going above and beyond to make us happy.

We were pleasantly surprised by the prices on their happy hour menu. We shared the Risotto Carbonara, Kobe Sliders and Kobe Stacks.   The sliders and the stacks were both surprisingly inexpensive for Kobe Beef. They were melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and very similar but I liked the stacks better personally. The Rizzoto was creamy and delicious, served piping hot. They also have a great selection of $5 wine by the glass, and they let you try a sip to ensure you like it before they pour your glass.  Overall I was very impressed and I'm sure we'll be coming back!",

Service was actually really good - on point.  Loved the atmosphere but it felt too modern for Italian.  Drinks and bread served promptly.  I wanted a sangria and they brought me a peach Bellini.  It was way too sweet so I sent it back for a glass of wine.  We ordered the Caesar salad to split which was great.  Our pasta dishes were just ok.  I got the spaghetti and meatballs.  Pasta didn't seem like it was made fresh at all.  My husband got some seafood pasta dish and the scallops were pretty rubbery.  Seemed like they cater to an older crowd.  Overall I don't think we would return but glad we tried something different.",

It was one of those places where at one point the Manager was helping us, at another point someone else ... then a few people were floating around helping, too.   It's odd to say, but they were a little too eager.  Stuff was cleared very quickly (in one instance before someone was even done), and it just seemed like they were rushing us unnecessarily, since it wasn't busy, and as I've noticed, it rarely is.    I still think this is a great date spot.  I just wouldn't say it's perfect just yet.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "I used my trusty Yelp app to find a restaurant in Scottsdale last night. As I was only in town for one night, and I was tired, I wanted something offering good food near the hotel. Tommy's fit the bill.   The place is well kept and somewhat trendy, but I didn't feel uncomfortable dining solo. I asked if they minded giving me a booth over in the corner, and the friendly server happily obliged. Water and service came quickly, and staff were eager to know if I had any questions regarding the menu. I didn't really, since I had checked it out ahead of time - I went with the beet salad to start, followed by the spaghetti carbonara. The salad was great - more of a traditional salad with beets on the side, but that was fine for me. The beets (golden) were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the salad was much larger than I usually expect for a starter. Despite that, I gobbled the whole thing down.   After (or during?) the salad course, they brought by some warm bread complete with a bowl of EVOO and balsamic - excellent. I limited myself to two small pieces of bread, but could have eaten the whole thing. The blend of oil and vinegar was great.   Finally, out came the pasta. It was homemade organic pasta, and again, perfectly cooked. Not sure I'm totally sold on putting squash in spaghetti carbonara, but the dish was still excellent. Again, a much larger portion than I expected, but they were happy to pack the leftovers up to go.   Both staff members who took care of me did a great job - quick, friendly, and efficient. If I lived in Scottsdale, I wouldn't hesitate to go back!",

    "text": "Add this one to my AZ Restaurant Week Hall of Fame.  So much great good, so much great service, so much awesome all around.  I need to give a special thank you to the owner Tommy for being so accommodating to our large group during Restaurant Week.  He had his staff reorganize our table at the last minute after some changes in our group size and did so at lightning speed.  He personally worked with me to make sure it was right and I can't thank him enough.  I don't venture into the Scottsdale area to dine out very often (even during Restaurant Week) so a little background on how I picked this place.  I needed a Restaurant Week spot that I could reserve for a large group on OpenTable.  In addition it had to have vegetarian options, was charging the Restaurant Week minimum price of $33/person, and was rated at 4 stars or higher on Yelp.  Tommy V's was the only one that met every criteria and polled at 4.5 stars on Yelp.  So I took a gamble on bringing 12 of us here despite none of us having been here.  Its located just east of Scottsdale Road and Indian School in the Old Town district.  Parking here was surprisingly easy as Tommy V's has its own private lot for their customers only.  From the outside, the restaurant looks pretty unassuming.  When you walk in its a different story.  You're immediately greeted by a glass structure with tons of different wines on display for the whole restaurant to see.  On the west side of the building is the bar area (which is fully stocked), and the sit down dining is on the east side.  The interior is elegant, but cozy at the same time.  As a guy I would be perfectly home here in a collared shirt or a suit.  It can be as casual or fancy as you want it to be.  I had done my Restaurant Week research in advance so I knew what I was getting.  Of the three appetizer options, I chose the Orecchiette Pasta.  Tiny pasta shells mixed with crab, shrimp and really nice thick chunks of lobster.  A fantastically rich (but not overwhelmingly rich) pasta mixing in fresh hearty portions of the seafood that goes great with a wine (I had a Syrah).  For the main course, I went with their Short Ribs with Gnocchi and two types of cheese.  Ridiculously tender meat that cuts easily with a fork and a gnocchi and cheese blend that exudes a creamy savory compliment to meat and soaks up the meat juices perfectly.  For the big finish, I went with the Salted Caramel Gelato.  A nice, cold, dense gelato but admittedly I didn't taste as much of the caramel as I expected.  In fact I picked up the chocolate notes on this one moreso than salted caramel.  It was still great, just a little surprising.  Total price for the three course meal, glass of Syrah, tax, and tip totaled about $55.  Between the outstanding food and very attentive service by our server Tyler, it was worth every penny.  And even with a jazz band playing over at the bar area and a full house of customers, our party of 12 was still able to converse easily without yelling across the table at one another.  Even though Yelp gave it 4.5 stars going in, even I was surprised how great the experience was.  Mad props to Tommy V's entire operation for delivering a Restaurant Week experience to remember.  Come for the food, but come back for the people.",

I started with an extra dirty martini, which was unfortunately not dirty enough.  I've definitely had better ones in the Chicagoland area.  We shared a couple appetizers and my favorite was the fried burrata.  We also had the Mozzarella Caprese, but as a hater of tomatoes, I passed on this one.  For my entree, I had the Red Snapper.  In hind sight, I wish I had the Sea Bass instead.  The Red Snapper, although cooked perfectly and accompanied by some yummy veggies, was overloaded with tomato sauce.  I tend to enjoy my fish more simply prepared.  The service was excellent.  The waiter heard us telling a long story about me loving corn, and he brought me out a bowl of corn.  It was actually delicious (no lie).  It was steaming hot, buttery with a nice kick to it.  Very attentive service :-)  We ended the night with chocolate cake to share. Nothing special, but nice for a bite or two to end the night with.",

Nice to know they have that sort of thing but we weren't upset by missing it.  The food and service were fabulous. I am lactose intolerant and some places don't really pay close attention to my needs: this place did a great job with that. Our server made sure to give me good advice for what to order and substituted things where needed. Instead of feeling as though I was doing without or as though the meal was missing something, our dishes seemed as though they were meant to be served sans-milk products. They never made me feel as though I was putting them out, which can happen sometimes. My favorite thing I ate was the salmon and vegetables. They were seasoned and cooked to perfection.   Great experience, attentive wait staff, accommodating chef. Can't ask for more!",

We have never had a bad meal otherwise at this restaurant, and Zoran pays attention to detail and wants to make sure each and every customer has an enjoyable experience.    There are many Italian restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix to choose from, but this restaurant stands out from all others.  A couple of our friends who joined us at our table are returning wine dinner diners, and they absolutely love the food (portions are generous), the wine and the experience each time.

He was humorous and treated us with fantastic banter along with excellent suggestions for dinner. It was restaurant week so the majority of us picked off of the limited 3-course meal menu.

Modern sleek look with some Rat Pack portraits on the wall - Ain't that a kick in the head!  I ordered the Pasta Trio which was delicious.  The ravioli's were so soft and creamy!  The only problem I see is the portion size.  I guess I can't complain since I rather enjoy quality over quantity.  However, I also thought it a tad bit pricey for the meals.  They do have a huge selection of wine available.  I think if I come back definitely would be during HH.  Service as real good I really enjoying talking to servers who know about the menu but also the wine.  Say Hi to Zorian when you get there he's one of the owners and is a joy to talk to. - Enjoy!",

We have the buchitini to start and it was surprisingly small but definitely tasty. I also ordered a cocktail that ended up being way too sweet and I had to send it back. The wait staff redid the cocktail for me, however it was still super sweet so they offered to comp me for it at the end of the meal. For the main meal I had the three pastas dish which was good but nothing stellar or imaginative. The gnocchi was defintiely the star of the dish and something I would go back for. For dessert I ended up having an expresso martini which was delicious and definitely something to try.  Overall, good but there are better places in town I would say with a more imaginative menu.",

    "text": "HUGE disappointment! I've dined at Tommaso & Tommy V'a is Phoenix regularly and love it. So, maybe my expectations were too high. The service was awful. It took 15 minuets from first drink order to delivery of the last drink. By the time that was delivered, the waiter told us the fish special was gone, at 7:15. Best part, white anchovies appetizer was great. Worst part, this is a group of 8 that visits a restaurant together once a month. It took more than an hour for the first plate to be served.. We ordered 8 meals. 20 minuets passed between delivery of first plate and the 8th plate!  Most in our group are polite and wait for everyone to be served before eating. So, they ate cold food. The short ribs were fatty and undercooked. By dessert it was a game to clock the time between presentation of the menu and dessert order. 12 minutes. We just wanted out of there by then. I was the only one in the group who actually liked his meal and I will never return.",

    "text": "I guess I'm in the minority, but I really wasn't terribly impressed with Tommy V's.  Based on the reviews, I picked this restaurant to celebrate my Birthday, but was pretty disappointed in the overall experience.  The restaurant itself is cute enough, big, with a rather benign vibe.  It wasn't too crowded on the Friday we went, and we were seated in a corner.  We started off with some appetizers.  I had the fried burrata, which I found to be pretty darn good.  Nothing crazy, but simple and nice.  For dinner I had the spaghetti carbonara.  Let me start off by saying I LOVE CARBONARA.  I get it for special occasions often.  This carbonara tasted mostly of pepper.  It was so overwhelming, I couldn't taste the pancetta or anything else.  I also wasn't a fan of the squash in it (something I hadn't seen before).  At the end, the waiter did bring me a dessert, for my birthday, but unfortunately it was chocolate mousse, which isn't something I enjoy.  Alas, it's ok because I was mostly turned off at that point anyway. I found the service here to be pretty good, especially because our waiter put up with all of us.    All in all, I'm not sure if I was wowed enough to come back, but I also wouldn't not come back.  We shall see what the future brings...",

When we walked in the door & saw the white tablecloths & extensive wine storage racks  we were concerned that we were underdressed & that the prices would be high. Our fears were unfounded - it was very casual and the staff was very friendly.   The wine list is wonderful! We settled on the Brancaia Tre  Super Tuscan that was delightful. For dinner I ordered the Hazelnut Risotto and it was fabulous; rich & creamy with mushrooms & hazelnut pieces. For dessert we shared the Copa de Amaretto, essentially a custard that was light and a wonderful finish to our dinner.  The portions were very large, we could have easily shared an entree.  The ambiance, service & high quality of Tommy V's food & wine list rate 5 stars from this Yelper.",

We enjoyed two of the house salads (very fresh, very substantial and great house dressing!) then hubby had the evening's special of meat lasagne and I had the beautifully served pasta trio with a glass of Stone Cellars Cab.

LOL  But seriously, all of us didn't feel so well afterwards and the food was in a word... Bland. Heck, I added salt to both my Carpaccio and Scallops (photos), and I don't salt anything!    Maybe the Chef had the night off, but this was a disappointment to all of us. So sorry, we'll take a pass for the time being on coming back. Though I really did enjoyed the black Sambuca. Hmmm",

I had the lamb chops which were prepared perfectly with tender asparagus and small potatoes. My wife loves gnocci and Tommy's is made from scratch.  Theirs features a different sauce but my wife wanted a traditional marinara which they pleasantly accommodated. I tasted them and they were very very good.  Their home made bread is excellent dipped in olive oil.  I also enjoyed the Manhattan I ordered.  Despite the mixed reviews we plan to return soon.",

Service was great and so were the drinks and appetizers, however most of us had the consensus about the food lacking flavor that night.  Maybe this is a one-off since the restaurant had great Yelp reviews.",

    "text": "Aww hate to go against the grain, but here we go.  It was dinnertime and we had some friends and family in town, who wanted the Old Town Scottsdale experience.    Opened up my trusty Yelp app, I pulled up the search \"Best Restaurants\" in \"Old Town Scottsdale\": Tommy V's was #4 on the list, and that's what our guests chose.  This was my first trip to Tommy's so I was excited seeing they had a solid 4.5 Star rating on Yelp.    I'll start by saying the restaurant itself was well decorated and had a nice atmosphere.  For 7:30 dinner on a Monday, the place was empty.  Our large party was seated near the entry way with the big glass windows.  That might have been a mistake.  It was HOT and felt as if there was no circulating air on our table.  Once our hot food came out I literally went into a hot flash and started pouring sweat.  I had to excuse myself and went to the bathroom to wipe my face down.  As I walked towards the rear of the building I could tell it was 15-20 degrees cooler and I immediately cooled off and was fine lol.  But, the table we sat at was noticeably hotter than the other side of the restaurant.  The Strawberry salad was excellent.  The use of feta cheese and the candied nuts with the vinaigrette was very tasty.  That was probably the most enjoyable thing I tried at Tommy V's.  I ordered the Filet Mignon for my main course, and it was ok.  I ordered it medium but it was over cooked along the entire outer part of the steak.  There were a few bites towards the center that were not over cooked and those bites were much more tasty, juicy and flavorful.  The over cooked bites just tasted like dried chewy beef, maybe I should order medium rare next time?    In all honesty I was expecting more... The mixture of an over-cooked $34 steak and the hot temperatures made this a 2 star experience for myself, but our guests did enjoy themselves and enjoyed their meal.   3 Stars",

It's an expensive lunch date so I understand.  All of us (6 of us) ordered salads.  5 of us ordered the chicken cobb salads.  My goodness the grilled chicken cobb salad was delicious.  I believe the salad dressings are house made and they're really good.  One of us ordered the ahi tuna salad.  It was smaller than ours, way smaller but the flavor was out of this world.  If dining on a corporate dime, check out Tommy V's for lunch.",

My wife and are from the New York metro area and know Italian food and this was certainly acceptable, not great but basic good. Service was excellent, but it was not overly busy. My only complaint and the reason this is not a four star review was the appetizer. We split the fried barrata app and the cheese was amazingly good. Have never seen fried barrata and enjoyed it. However, the fresh tomato's with basil that came with the dish were horrible. Unripe supermarket plum tomatoes that actually crunched when I bit into them. I mean how can you not source fresh local tomatoes in June?",

The veal chop special was overwhelmed by the sweetness of the cherry balsamic compote to a point you could taste little else. The only thing that was any good was the tiramisu. Great consistency, moist and light. I also tried the vanilla ice cream which tasted like old freezer burned ice milk. Wine list is good and fairly priced but not enough to get me anywhere close again. Service was friendly and attentive.

Bartender was too busy talking to the waitress to care. Last night I took my family. 6 meals and 6 people saying  they didn't like their food.  Everything was WAY over salted including the shrimp. Lobster ravioli was suspiciously fishy.  I had the shrimp and orzo which wasn't as salty, but overall just OK. Our server was good, but that was it.  I should have none when I got a last minute Rez for a big table.  100 better places within a mile.  Don't waste your money!!",

    "text": "First timer to this restaurant but an old soul when it comes to Italian food. The restaurant has a nice pleasant vibe, I sat at the bar, it's long and comfortable and provides a great view (I love to see what other people are having). I ordered half a bottle of a Cabernet from Chile, they have a good offering of wines and not expensive at all, love the option of a half bottle. I also ordered the Tuscan Grill Mix, Lamb Chops, chicken and sausage They bring you bread and olive oil, the bread was a bit on the burned side, same as the table next to me, well actually theirs was almost black burned!. Then the food arrived, I was a bit disappointed to find a bit of skinny couple of lamb chops a very thin chicken breast a what resembled a think burned hotdog. Unfortunately the lamb was kind of dry and over cooked, same with the chicken, you would expect dry chicken breast at Olive garden but not here. It was not bad, well seasoned but far from where it should be. Disappointing. Desert menu needs a couple more offerings but that is my humble opinion, I ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, I know this being an Italian restaurant I should probably had the Tiramisu or the cannoli but oh well, the cake was good, nothing special. Bottom line, and my rating is always on function of this: would I come back? Probably not, there are way to many other options to try instead on spending this kid of money to try to find that good dish in this restaurant (probably there is a few) but not again.",

The lobster ravioli was okay, but never again. My boyfriend disagrees, but I'd argue I have a more advanced palate. Finally, tonight I ordered the handmade pasta trio. It's $19 for four raviolis and 7 gnocchi. The ravioli were two spinach and some sort of cheese blend I can't recall off the top of my head. The other two ravioli were wild mushroom. The spinach ravioli were forgettable, and the gnocchi were soggy. The wild mushroom ravioli were really good, but two wild mushroom ravioli are not worth $19.   So, it looks like we're going to have to break up.",

    "text": "Scottsdale is one of those cities that doesn't immediately come to mind as an innovator of the culinary arts. I will say, however, that I have been impressed by the sheer amount of portions and quality of food at certain restaurants here. Tommy V's Urban Kitchen & Bar would easily get a 3ish star in SF, but in Scottsdale, closer to a 4.  I came with a couple of colleagues on a business trip, and we were almost the only people in the unusually large space. Wait a minute -- there was a group of white collar men sitting at the bar who were conspicuously leering at our table since we were the only 2 groups there. That aside, here's what we ordered:  Baby Beet Avocado Puree, Goat Cheese, Muscato Vinaigrette & Roasted Macadamia - nice and fresh, but nothing that special    Tommy's Amazing Homemade Pasta Trio, with the following:                                                                                                     - Tortelli Wild Mushroom, Portobello Mascarpone - Ravioli Spinach Ricotta Truffle - Gnocchi, Brie, Asiago Cheese, Brown Butter Sage Sauce -- this was great as portions were large and perfect for us to share. I liked all 3, but the tortelli wild mushroom was my favorite  Eggplant Torta & Butternut Squash Ravioli Herb Tomato Sauce, Cheese Fondue       - can't remember this too well to be honest  Potato-Hazelnut Truffle Souffle - amazing!  And yes, I did copy those items straight from the menu. Our experience was also paired with an extremely nervous waiter who was constantly coming by to check in on us, tell us incorrect information, then come back to correct himself. I'm sure he was trying his best to deliver great service, but it was a bit overkill. All in all, nice restaurant for an affordable meal in the Scottsdale area.",

OK - maybe I would, but only because of the layout... they did a great job urbanizing and upgrading this restaurant!  I went in for an early dinner with friends recently and was pleasantly surprised by the new decor, service, and of course, the food.  Being welcomed by Zoran, the Operating Partner of Tommy V's, and former GM of the (now closed) Estate House, was a treat as well.  Service was top notch as our party of five made our way through a variety of menu items family style.  Highlights for me included the following: -Legume Spinach Soup (lentils, beans, garbanzo, spinach, vegetable stock) - I know it sounds very healthy and boring, but it was delicious! -Manila Clams Linguine (a tad on the buttery side, but I didn't mind) -Spinach Ricotta Ravioli -Veal Parisienne (I'm not usually a veal person, but I enjoyed this breaded preparation) -Grilled Asparagus (you can never eat enough veggies) -Potato-Hazelnut Truffle Souffle  And, finally, we shared a dessert plate, but I think I ate the majority of the lemon dessert that was served with fresh strawberries.  I don't know what exactly it was, but Baby M was all about it!  I noticed Tommy V's \"happy hour menu,\" served Monday - Friday from 11am - 6:30pm a little late in the game, (it includes a solid variety of $5 wines and discounted appetizers), but I plan on returning soon to check that out.",

I decided to sit at the bar as I was alone and was able to watch some TV and see the crowd in the restaurant as it stayed fairly busy for a week night but this is Scottsdale so it's not surprising.

    "text": "Our first trip to Scottsdale and we hit all the high points for restaurants. This was the pinnacle! My spouse and I had a fabulous lunch and we wish we had gone here for supper!   The food was so FRESH! The house salad was exceptional with baby greens that had been harvested recently! The dressing is light but SO flavorful!   My husband ordered the scallops...WOW! They were totally rocked with freshly made gnocchi and steamed arugula and fresh asparagus!   I had the eggplant torte and butternut squash tortellini which was 'knock your socks off' spectacular! The squash tortellini had the perfect amount of nutmeg and something else that I couldn't put my finger on...it was truly spectacular!  And not to dis the bread but the olive oil is a sweet one...it could be drunk right out of the bowl!  If given the opportunity, Tommy Vs is definitely worth visiting for a fresh creative meal in Scottsdale!",

We decided to split our meals so we could try a bit of everything. Everything was delicious! Our waitress Elisabethe (from Milan) was wonderful and helped us with our wine selection. We got the Mussels and Caprese salad for appetizers with some Cosmo cocktails. Different pastas, eggplant, and risotto for our entres and a delicious  chianti. Can't wait to come back here - highly recommend! 5+ stars!",

We had some delicious meals while in Scottsdale, but this one was pretty average. The one standout dish was the Cioppino special which my hubby ordered, which was quite tasty, but skip the short ribs. The portions were generous but the quality, flavor, and tenderness were just not there.",

    "text": "We had been wanting to try this place for a while. It was worth the wait!  The service was excellent. We started with the fried calamari and carpaccio. The carpaccio was best we had ever eaten. Just delicious. The calamari was also very good. I had the short ribs for my main dish. It was very tasty but too small. It was accompanied with gnocchis. If they would have added more gnocchi and another piece of short ribs, it would have been a normal portion.y husband had the fettuccine bolognese. It was delicious. My mother had the chicken Milanese which was light and wonderful. I will most definitely go back for dinner next time. I saw they had a linguine with clam sauce. Excellent place!!",

They even had my name on the menus saying \"happy birthday\". Had the chicken Parmesan. Really tasty red sauce. I'm an Italian food purist and they left me with a great impression on this dish! Thanks Tommy V's!!",

Tommy Vs you can do better.",

    "text": "I first visited this restaurant shortly after it opened.  I have since returned several times and must say that I have consistently received the same service and quality of food - extraordinary!  They seem to always be committed to ensuring not only 100% customer satisfaction, but that every experience is an exceptional one.  I was so impressed that I felt compelled to write my first Yelp review.    The server was perhaps a little hard to understand (only if you don't speak fluent Italian), but he was extremely friendly and really only added to the culture and atmosphere of the restaurant.  We started with the Fried Burrata.  Delicious!  This is a great starter or even the perfect nosh while you sip their fine selection of wines.  Moving on to dinner...  I am convinced that they have the best Chicken Piccata in town, but they had a Lamb Chop special with Mushroom Risotto on Friday night, so I had both!  The Lamb was done to perfection - very tender.  For dessert they brought me some of the best Tiramisu I've ever had and we finished the night with the traditional Limoncello.  Definitely a must try if you are looking for a quality dining experience in the Scottsdale area!",
