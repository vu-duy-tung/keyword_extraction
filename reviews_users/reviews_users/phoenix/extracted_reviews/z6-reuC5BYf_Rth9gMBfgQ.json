    "text": "Brunch was the meal of the day this Sunday morning. We had the whole upstairs to our monthly group, SMUNCH. Seating was nice arranged and quite comfortable. I had the scrambled eggs and the baguette. I also tasted the roasted potatoes and tried some of the skillet waffle.  The quality of food was great. Very tasty and I enjoyed the meal. The one common comment was that the two eggs looked like they could be gobbled up in two  1/2 bites. They were tasty but on the smaller side.  The roasted potatoes came with a tangy sauce, all good...and the bread was like wow!! I am glad I ordered my own little loaf as I also got to take it home and have great bread with my own little bit of grilling.  Would I come back again, yes! The staff as very friendly in fact I kept wondering how many people worked there as new face kept appearing with plates of tood for our party. Even the Chef delivered which is always awesome when the chef takes time to meet the customer  They also have live music, which was NOT obnoxious but rather created a great little ambiance. Then again a Big Bass and little keyboard will do that.",

It was tangy, smidge sweet and acidic from the tomatos...absolutely delish. I ordered an almond margarita out of curiosity...you must try! It is hard to describe...but it totally works. We had the hanger steak and salmon. Hanger steak was sooo flavorful, tender...exactly what i wanted. The salmon is spectacular! I cant wait to return and try everything else! It all looked good.",

It's exposed brick walls, lofted dining area, glass garage door and cozy patio...it's what I envision my future residence to be.  Similar to the decor, the menu boasts a variety of comfort food with a modern twist.  Pot roast with bok choy and polenta?  Heck yes, why didn't anyone think of that sooner?  The portions are generous and I've always gone home wtih a box of left overs.  Let's talk liquor.  They have a great beer selection but if you are a fan of sangria, you MUST try theirs.  It tastes as if the citris has been marinating in there for days, which is just the way I like it.   I took my foodie friend from the the big apple here for a celebratory dinner and he absolutely loved it (I know this because his plate was spotless by the end of our dinner).  If it's good enough for a new yorker, you KNOW it's good.   Brunch here was just as wonderful.  The blood marys were strong and the entrees were hearty enough to cure our hangovers.  Again, the portions were large portions yet packed with flavor.  I recommend the baked eggs and their cauliflower soup which was incredibly creamy and not gritty like you'd find at other places.",

The fingerling potatoes were absolutely delicious.  I only had a bit of her \"flatbread\"... i was too busy with my burger. the \"french onion\" burger is spectacular. the french-fried onions, gruyere cheese and arugula are a great complement to the brioche bun and the tender ground beef patty.

The server, Daniel, said he'd \"do something for us.\" Hubby's crispy onion burger was greasy and underseasoned. Check came and Daniel did not do amything for us. So it's highly unlikely that we will return to this restaurant.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here on a Thursday evening.  It was just OK all around.  The food was not bad, but overpriced for the quality.  Comparing it to something like Postinos, I think Postinos has better quality food.  I think the ambiance was pretty cool, we sat on the second floor overlooking the bar.  Although the waiter was friendly, he did not seem to be on top of his game.  Funny story:  My wife ordered a salad and asked to get it without bacon.  The waiter said \"wow, you're really good at noticing details, aren't you?  Most people ask after the salad comes to the table\".  We were both a little puzzled at this statement, as he seemed to be shocked that someone actually read the menu.  Well, after all that, when he brought the salad, what would ya know, the bacon was left on it.  :)  I was so tempted to be like \"hey, you're not really good at noticing details, are you?\"  Anyway, we let it go and my wife was like 90% done with the salad when he finally came back around and said \"sorry\" and gave us another salad.  A nice gesture, but it was too late at that point... two salads is one too much.  I ended up getting the meatballs.  It was unique but way too much sauce and just not the most appetizing flavor.   All and all, we have no solid plans to go back.  Nothing except the style impressed us, and there are too many good places out there.",

From the courteous staff (everyone said a genuine \"hi!\") to the bartender, the food runners and the waitstaff, tremendous customer service. Onto the food... the creamy polenta app and the kale/cabbage salad are winners (especially the salad).  For an entree, try the seafood ciopino (ask for it spicy if you can handle...absolutely worth it). Great for dates, family special occasions, etc. etc.  A gem in Phoenix!!",

    "text": "went to St. Francis twice in past month and I must admit that i will be going there in the future. I am giving this place this high of a rating not because i had a meal that blew my socks off. It is because these people have managed to put together a neighborhood place that has fantastic atmosphere and good food.  The first visit was about 4 weeks ago for lunch. We sat inside for patio was completely booked. This was not a bad decision for we loved the ambiance. For my meal i had the short rib sandwich. It just stood out and i had to have it. The dish was very tasty. the only down side of it was that it got a little soggy so the bread lost that crunch, but the flavor was there and this was to be expected from that juicy beef.  Went for dinner last Tuesday and the seating situation was exactly the same. Outside was packed, the bar was full so we had to sit inside or wait for about 30 minutes for outdoor seat. No problem... we set at the table inside and again had a great time.  The ambiance was great. servers were fun and helpful and the place was filled with cool people.  For appetizer i had the goat cheese that was good. it was recommended to us by our server and we were grateful for that. tomato sauce added just enough acidity to the dish to keep the cheese from being too potent. nice crunch with the crostinis.  One of us ordered the pot roast that was very good. Cool thing about it was that the dish did not come out as heavy as we have expected. The meat was juicy and tender and polenta was just great. The cioppino had very good amount of seafood in it but we thought that the sauce was a bit of a let down. We expected that zing that cioppino should deliver along with an abundance of fresh aromas, but in this case it was missing. Do not get me wrong, the dish was good but not great.  Finlay , the prime hanger steak was good but little over done. It was ordered MR but delivered MW. The mashed potatoes were great and roasted cipolini were fantastic. the mushroom ( i think it was a form of demi ) was delicious. not overpowering and allowing other ingredients to speak for themselves. Had it not been overcooked, this dish would have been a winner.  All in all a great experience at ST. Francis and i will be bringing friends there for time to come.",

The food was brought out on large wooden platters instead of your traditional glass plate which was kinda cool. The music was loud enough to mask the conversations around me but to loud that I couldn't talk with my wife, we liked the whole ambience of this place. Now  I love to eat food and when I go out I want enough on my plate to be able to enjoy what I am eating. The portions were large and I left full but both my wife and I were very happy with how the food tasted. Everything was delicious. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. We went the week after Christmas so I think they were probably less busy than normal. I felt the food was fairly priced for what I got and we also noticed on their website it shows that kids eat free!",

You butt up to the person behind you. So weird and uncomfortable. *If you go, I'd go with a party of four and request a table against the wall (not a booth). In addition, upon entering, I felt like we were placed at one of the \"lesser desired\" tables in front of the kitchen walkway because we didn't have a reservation. They asked us at the door.

The food here is farm to table and seasonal, but each time I've come I've been able to order the duck and have not been disappointed.  The duck was seasoned and prepared well (although I wish the skin had been crispier). I was also able to try the meatballs and the big rib, both were delicious!  Tonight we had a party of 8 from all over the US and we ordered the bread plate appetizer, meatballs, the big rib, duck, roasted chicken, and the onion dip burger.  All were fantastic!  Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal.",

When our table was ready, we were seated. I ordered the Salmon, and the Sweet Potato (which I split with my friend). It was soo good, Great Gluten free dinner. Lots of flavor in the quinoa. The waiter, was very attentive and good spirits. I will definitely venture out here again! Maybe when its a little cooler to enjoy the patio!",

I've come here a few times with friends and family and I always enjoy the atmosphere, the outside seating is nice even when it might seem to hot to go out.  They have a wonderful happy hour and who doesn't appreciate locally sourced ingredients.  They are always happy to accommodate and one night they let my girlfriends and I stay even after they had closed up shop and were about to finish cleaning the place.  That's what I call great customer service!  The desserts at St. Francis are my favorite.  I've devoured the sticky toffee pudding and the Apple Crumb Tart,  you should enjoy them at some point too.  I feel that this picture of the Apple Crumb Tart speaks for itself, you would be a fool to skip dessert here.  My favorite dish at St. Francis, other than dessert, is the Pig Dip.  The pork loin is cooked perfectly, I'm a sucker for prosciutto and bacon and the fennel marmalade, Dijon and Gruyere make my taste buds scream for joy.  I have to state for the record that I have not had brunch here yet and it always looks fantastic when I see people posting pictures.",

I live in CA and visit my fiance in AZ often so we like to try new places when I'm there. Went at lunchtime today after checking the ALL DAY menu online ahead of time. I wanted the baked goat cheese.  Nope, not available. The stuffed peppers and parm risotto weren't available either.  The ALL DAY menu is NOT all day apparently. Hmpf! So I went with the Chile Burger....supposedly the best burger in AZ.  It was pretty tasty. Heat, good meat, well cooked. We also split the pumpkin soup which was delicious, but could use like 3-4 more pieces of the croutons. Our server took a long time to get our drinks. He never asked how the meal was.  And he filled my fiance's water, but not mine.  Overall, the food was good, but I don't think we'll revisit.",

    "text": "St. Francis should repent? Five \"Hail Mary's\" please. Or at least two consistent bloody mary's...  Heck, best leave it to the old school men of the cloth to dole out \"punishment\" but - - - fifty-eight dollars lighter after a \"not so heavenly\" brunch for two (not including tip)(we were in a group of six) - the wallet is feeling a little punished. Having now been to this resto on three occasions - each time leaving less satisfied than the time before, well - - - it's time for a last write.    SInce we enjoy spending money on good food/drink, service and ambiance, St. Francis' prices didn't dissuade...until the experience didn't live up to the bill:  Ambiance : modern Phoenix standard interior, nice open air feel, live music at brunch lends itself to a lovely atmosphere, but volume on the music to the point of someone asking to turn it down (someone NOT being me, Hallelujah! because it's usually me) and tables with \"back to back benches\"...husband elbowed chronically by guy behind him and I know I took out the lady's spine unintentionally behind me...makes for the misery like flying coach.  Food and drink - Unacceptably inconsistent...even at the same table during the same meal. I'd love to recommend the Bloody Mary & I do - that is, the FIRST one we had. It was so hopped up on tabasco and flavorful that, it was a huge hit of heat. It was kind of surprisingly intense at first...but then....determined...loved it! Bring us another. The second round came about forty minutes later for two of us girls and Nada. Nothing. No oomph. Not even the same garnish. Mine went from the green olive, lemon and lime to no olive, a pearl onion and what looked like a half-eaten pepprocini. Thinking about it now . . . on the first order, I'd requested \"fresh horseradish\" on the side.  Instead of the server obliging, she replied, \"It already has that in it.\" I still noted, \"that's great, please bring additional.\" Maybe the bartender / server decided, \"we'll show her?!\" (It was hotter than the devil's den!) Who knows. Maybe just different bartenders. But the outcome of inconsistency is unappealing anyway you garnish it...especially when priced at nine bucks. On the up-side...my egg sandwich was reasonable - \"good\", a nice portion and with a side salad - a value at $10. I think I've always had a \"one really good item\" at St. F and it kept me coming back, but one item does not an overall good experience make - especially three visits over.  Further inconsistency: the scrambled chorizo dish. One guest's plate - piled amply, the other - roughly two-thirds as much if even that.  The iron skillet pancake was good - a good size, but not really a steal at eight bucks.     Service - She was friendly, but insisted on reciting the six orders instead of writing them down and subsequently, a wrong dish was delivered. Then, one friend waited while the rest of us ate - you know that scenario. Then, not even an offer by our server or a manager to comp a drink of theirs. In addition, hot sauce was requested by our other friend...never delivered. The check came and...you guessed it - incorrect.   The group we were with - all fairly new friends - no one wanted to sour the spirit at the table and to speak up too much. Later though, we did note the shortcomings of this brunch.    Time for confession - never should have given it the third try.",

They had lots of app/small plates/salad items that I'd like to try.  The entree selection was a little less interesting unfortunately.  However, we both liked what we had quite a lot, and two friends who ate there same week also like their dishes (all 4 different things).      Wine list is short, but both reasonable and comprehensive enough that most anyone can find something they like.   A lot of Arizona wine selections, which I am unfamiliar with.  I was hoping waitress would be able to shed more light on them, but unfortunately she was either unable or unwilling to answer my query.    The restaurant is a little loud inside and would benefit from a few soft surfaces to soften the sound.  I'm not sure why but the trend the last 10 years or so seems to be very sleek designs that look great but don't function well  - as they ignore the sound quality and acoustics of a space.   Anyway - we were still able to carry on pleasant conversation.  Parking is complementary valet only.  I walked, but that's a nice touch - and common if a place has tight or limited parking.    Anyway - we had  a great time.",

    "text": "This is a weird review, because St. Francis is one of our favorite restaurants. We're \"regulars\" there -- but, after last night's experience (one-star) we are going to be taking a break for quite some time. We've been there regularly over the last three years, and recommend the restaurant to friends and out-of-owners. The atmosphere is nice and the people have always been very caring and thoughtful. I have a terrible allergy, and they (with one exception) have always kept my meals free of my problem foods.  Last night was a disaster, however. We went for the Happy Hour, which I see gets good reviews here on Yelp. The problem is that their Happy Hour menu is integrated into the standard menu, in a way that perhaps the person who designed it understands, but not necessarily the casual reader. We came in, saw a giant blurb on the menu that said \"Happy Hour -- Cocktails $5\" and selected a couple of cocktails when the initially attentive waitress came up to the table.   Later, however, that waitress proved completely inattentive, concerned solely with another large table nearby. We must have called out to this woman a half-dozen times, trying to get her attention, without success. Over and over again, we'd call to her when she was just three feet away taking care of the large table, and she would keep her back to us. (We're normally very easy-care customers -- we just wanted to check on ingredients for one dish, due to allergies.)  When the bill came, the $5 cocktails proved to be $12 each! It was a shocker, to say the least. I asked the waitress, who we did see again at time for our bill, to please correct the charge and she said that the menu is \"quite clear\" about cocktails, and these were not included in the Happy Hour. I looked over the menu, and saw her point -- but it was sure confusing. There's a tiny mark next to certain drinks. There's no explanation of what that mark means (we assumed it was just a \"Bartender's Favorite\" kind of notation), but evidently only certain drinks are included in the discount, and not the ones we ordered.  Personally, I'd say that when customers come in and order a Happy Hour food special, and the cocktails they order are NOT on the HH menu, the wait staff needs to clarify the pricing in advance. If you're going to print a menu with this kind of confusing detail on it, you'll need to ensure that waiters are not going to be confrontational when someone expresses a miscommunication has occurred. This gal wasn't nasty, but she made us feel like we were real dummies because we didn't read their wacky menu correctly.  In this case, two regulars (who have always loved this place) will now avoid St. Francis and hopefully find when we next visit that we don't sit in her section, and that the Happy Hour menu is clear, or that management will at least \"get\" that not everyone understands their hieroglyphics and what it means about the price of your food.",

The pork chile verde was so so good! --get it with the egg on top. It's delish. Not too spicy (I'm such a baby when it comes to spicy..I can take it a little spicy but not too much). The homemade cornbread was really tasty and the crispy fingerling potatoes with the lemon aioli.. And fried herbs! So yum.  34.66 inc tax?

The moment we pulled in you're vehicle is complimentarily parked by a valet team and you we walked in and were sat quite promptly. The service was great everything was brought out quickly and hot. I ordered the eggs Benedict with salmon and OMG it was amazing. Came with their hollandaise sauce and potatoes that were to DIE for. Great atmosphere very modern and comfortable seating arrangement. Also tried this orange juice mint drink that was super tasty. I'll make it a pony to come back on future outings.",

    "text": "Had brunch with my daughter here (finally - it'd been on my list to check out for soooo long!) It lived up to the hype! Love the casual urban chic interior design. The patio seating looked very inviting, too, so I think I'll request that next time. They had the wall open behind the bar which just created the perfect brunch ambiance for enjoying our gorgeous Phoenix winter weather. Was pleasantly surprised by the diversity of the crowd -- nice to see older people, trendy hipsters and families with young children all contentedly co-mingling. :)  Brunch portions were VERY generous -- we had to get to-go boxes! Daughter & I shared their cinnamon roll and I'm pretty sure it was bigger than my head (and I have some pretty big curly hair, so that's saying something!) It was so big we were unsure we'd finish it -- and then we tasted it and that sucker was devoured in short order, with daughter scraping every last bit of cinnamon and frosting drizzle off the plate! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Don't remember the name of the dishes we had but it was pretty traditional breakfast fare -- just done excellently. The bacon was divine! Again, generous portions. Might've finished if we'd not started with that ginormous roll, lol, but it was all so very good and we have zero regrets about the excess calories, bwahaha!  My kiddo's a tween so she didn't get to enjoy the free meals they offer kids but if you have young ones, this place should suit everyone -- delicious eats for parents / grandparents and free yummies for the kids. We'll be back. :)",

We sat on a bench with no back, directly up against the people behind us! I was literally back to back touching the person sitting behind me. Then the meal I chose the Prime Hanger Steak which came with whipped potatoes. Did I mention it was $30? As the most expensive dish on the menu I expected it to be a decent sized portion. It came out with 5 small pieces of meat, so red it was still mooing, and a tiny bit of whipped potatoes. Since I was still hungry after my meal I ordered the chocolate cake desert, which was the only redeeming part of the night.  At least I never have to go back.",

Yes, I was sent a gift certificate so that I might try dinner again.  I LOVE that gesture, and it was very much appreciated!  I am only sorry that it took me so long to 1) return, and 2) to update my review.  I returned for a visit at the first part of September.  However, my position remains the same.  I really do love the ambiance!  But my service experience has been just poor...defined as not attentive, and not even very friendly.

Luckily, a couple of us with smaller appetites were able to split our Pig Dip sandwich without any fuss from the staff or 'split' charge you sometimes see at more upscale places. They even served it on separate plates and gave us each our own basket of fries.   The sandwich was quite yummy and we enjoyed a couple brews, as well.

The atmosphere is trendy, fresh, unpretentiously sophisticated and although it's right off of busy Camelback Road, you'd never know it once you step through the doors.   First and foremost, I like that they allow you to make reservations, even during the lunch hour. This is smart to do because it does get crowded. The food here is simple with a culinary twist. The menu offers flatbreads, salads, sandwiches and other options. On a previous visit, I tried the burger which was juicy and delicious (as well as a little pricey). The burger is definitely a good option to order if you are in a hungry mood. The fries are thick steak fries with plenty of salty goodness to them. On my most recent visit, I had the Del Real which is a sandwich with goat cheese, cucumber, peppers, onion marmalade and avocado, plus I added turkey. It comes with your choice of a side salad or fries, but this time around I fought through my cravings and opted for the side salad. The sandwich was on ciabatta bread and absolutely delicious! The side salad had a great dressing to it as well.   All in all, the meal was delicious and the atmosphere was good too!",

Followed by introducing himself, he suggested the featured dinner for the night, Pan Brazed Scallops.

My mother had the Chorizo and Shrimp Flat bread and my friend had the Cheese Flat bread. To sum it up, the flat breads were an upscale pizza. Deliciously cheesy.

I would have given St Francis four or five stars, but the service was sub-par.  When they brought our entrees out there were no forks on the table.   We asked for forks and none came.  As our meal was getting cold, I got up and went to the service stand and grabbed the only fork that was left.  Finally, our server came with forks and said that they were busy and ran out of forks.    You tell me, what kind of restaurant runs out of clean forks at 7p on a Saturday night?",

They have an accommodating, kind, and thoughtful staff!  The drinks... Oh, the drinks. I'm not usually a cocktail person, but I ordered the Strawberry Basil Caiparinha and the Cucumber Cooler. They're made with actual fruit and were a delight. Not terribly sweet, so perfect for my taste buds. But the crowning glory was the cucumber cooler. Hendrick's Gin, Lemonade... To. Die. For. I HIGHLY recommend this cocktail!  For a date night, it was perfect, and relatively dead late at night. The ambiance of the patio was wonderful for the feel of the evening, and was a perfect treat to round out my night.  And for brunch? My tongue was titillated with the delight of an appetizer of a baguette with pear-ginger jam & butter, the \"Smoked Salmon\" and a mimosa.   The smoked salmon was served like a Benedict, hollandaise and all, along with fried fingerling potatoes that still make me drool, even still! I dipped the 'taters into remaining hollandaise and ate until I couldn't anymore! It was simply too good, and I would love to enjoy it again - I can't wait to!  I was also impressed with them locally-sourcing goods, such as their tea from Maya in Tucson. It was high-quality, and tasty. I'm a total beverage snob, so I appreciate quality coffee and tea!  If you like fine tasting food and beverage, this place is great. Brunch also features a jazz group playing, that fits perfectly with the atmosphere provided. I highly recommend this for a date, or a special treat!",

Yes, they charge you $2 for it but they serve a warm loaf of bread with high quality extra virgin olive oil. Also, be sure to get the quinoa salad, which is one of my favorites.  For an entree, everything we have ordered has been great. I have tried the green chile pork and the pot roast. Both of these dishes were amazing. As for my wonderful girlfriend, she always sticks to the salmon which has been good perfectly evertime and is always fresh. When her parents were here with us the got the special which was a fettucini carbonara, and one of the best around. If they have this on the menu, order it. The burgers and flat breads looked really good too, so I will have to order one next time.  The drink menu is extensive and they have a good beer list. Also, be sure to save room for dessert as the bananas foster is great.",

    "text": "We don't know if we are somehow jinxed, but while we have had a favorable opinion of the food, the restaurant cannot seem to connect the dots with service.  Tonight was a prime example - a relatively quiet Sunday evening around 7:30.  We sat at the bar and placed our order for dinner.  The soup and bread came out uneventfully, but it went downhill after that.  The waitress / bartender brought out my entree, the Risotto, and instead of what my partner had ordered - their pork chop - she brought out the pot roast for him  Then she proceeded to tell us that she had punched in the order wrong, and added that they were out of the port chops - this after I had my meal in front of me.  We were ready to walk out of the restaurant at that point, and then a chef came out and suddenly advised us that they were not out of pork chops.  Knowing that the chop is cooked on the entire rack from prior visits (hence \"the limited availability\") we then knew that either the waitress and/or the kitchen had initially lied to us to foist an unwanted entree item on us.  15 minutes later, after I had stalled in eating my meal so I would not be finished before the other entree arrived we finally had the second meal.  All in all, the night was a very stressful and unpleasant ordeal.  Several visits earlier, our entire dinner order was \"lost\" - this after we waited for 40 minutes after finishing the soup.  While the food has generally been pretty good, the service level will take this restaurant off of our list, which is a shame since we live only a half mile away, and like to support all of the neighborhood establishments.",

    "text": "We decided to check out St Francis after seeing it reviewed on PBS's \"Check Please Arizona\". And we were definitely impressed. Really cool architecture, design and ambiance!   To the bar for a drink before dinner! I ordered the organic bottled \"Sum'r\" Ale (by Four+ / Uinta Brewing out of Utah) which I loved! If you've got tasty organic beer, you've automatically got extra points in my book!  :)  My friends initially ordered cocktails at the bar and then wine at dinner. We were impressed with the wine suggestions made by our server at dinner. He was very knowledgeable in the vino department!  All of us enjoyed the dinners we ordered. I had the mozzarella salad. It was delicious although when something is called a \"salad\", I would anticipate greens of some sort to accompany it. Very good, but not really a salad. The others ordered the french onion burger w/ fingerling potatoes, the roasted salmon and the pot roast. Everything was beautifully presented using fresh, high quality, seasonal ingredients.",

    "text": "This place has exceeded my expectations every time I've visited.  I've experienced brunch and dinner at St. Francis and have been impressed with everything I've ordered (and everything my friends have let me sneak bites of!).  For brunch, the Homemade Biscuit (with vegetable gravy) was perfection. I'm no stranger to fatty breakfasts, and was really impressed by the richness of this dish. On a separate occasion, I enjoyed a mimosa with my Iron Skillet Pancake (perfect amount of sweetness with the chocolate and berries) and an order of scrambled eggs. No need to add salt -- Chef Aaron Chamberlain gets it right. I'm known to judge a breakfast by its eggs and this one was fluffy and the perfect break from my sweet pancake adventure. I topped it off by splitting their GIANT cinnamon roll with my friend. Even the two of us couldn't finish it!  The live Jazz is a classy touch, and the perfect backdrop for a Sunday rendezvous.  I've had dinner on a few occasions and ordered their Roasted Salmon, Steak, and Pot Roast. All cooked to order (and cooked to perfection). Paul prefers his steak \"moo\"-ing. I prefer mine a little more... umm... cooked. Both were great. The pot roast has been my favorite. My advice is to pair any of these dishes with their signature Cucumber Cooler (which includes some legit Hendricks Gin and is garnished with a cucumber).  The service has been wonderful and prompt every time I've visited. On my most recent dinner there, our server noticed I was wearing a black dress and asked if I would prefer a black napkin over a white one. I asked why, and he replied that the white ones shed and he would hate for me to get lint all over my dress. That's the kind of consideration that really makes the service at St. Francis shine.  Combine the amazing food and great service with gorgeous, modern decor... and I'd say you have a winning restaurant.  I'm so excited for their new weekday breakfast schedule and the espresso bar/cafe that's going to be added. I'll be headed back to St. Francis for sure.",

It had A LOT of flour on the bottom and was soft and fluffy, not the typical crisp flat bread I am used to. I wasn't blown away but I was also not disappointed. The atmosphere is wonderful. However, we went here for our child's birthday and no desert was offered to him. That was a little saddening, seeing how it was ranked best restaurant for kids. At any rate, I won't be rushing back but I also won't be running away. Cornbread was probably the star of the night.",

Because the bar opens to the outside, it's a treat sitting there -- whether you're on the inside looking out, or on the outside catching a breeze. If you have out-of-towners and want to take them somewhere fun, I'd recommend this place.",

My girlfriends each had a spinach salad and a pizzeta (sp?).  I think our total tab was around $50 for 3 of us and my son.  I'm pretty sure I inhaled my lunch in 5 minutes, maybe less.  SO GOOD. Can't wait to go back for dinner.  The space is beautiful.  So much light and so well-designed.  Kudos to Aaron for transforming an office building so beautifully.  Not a detail was missed.  I was really pleased to have a great experience at St. Francis.  After reading the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Will definitely be back--I just wish it wasn't an hour away from me....",

Next visit was the Moroccan meatballs (OMG yummy!). Portions are generous.   I tried the blueberry corn trifle for dessert. Quirky, creative and it totally worked. The popcorn on top added just the right amount of texture.  Parking is sticky, and the building is mid-block (next to a bank) so be careful not to drive right by it. Valet available.   Service good. Shaded patio (duh, it's Phoenix!).  Bottom line,great place for happy hour eats & drinks, or a swanky date night! Lots of food options to enjoy.",

They also had a live jazz band on Sunday morning which made for a really nice, lively atmosphere.  The only reason why it's not a 5-star is because they have mandatory valet and the temperature was a little off. Even though it was well over 100 degrees outside, they still had the doors/windows open. I am all about the indoor/outdoor space, but maybe it's not the best idea during the summer. Even with AC blasting, those of us who were sitting next to the open doors were really hot.  Overall great brunch spot that I highly recommend!",

Hubby chose the pumpkin soup which he stated was \"ok\". The shrimp risotto for hubby again received a \"just Ok\" rating. I chose a simple romaine salad which was \"ok\".

Our waiter was very friendly and gave his recommendations on drinks and food and even offered us complimentary orange juice later on as we chatted with him more. I decided to go with the Salmon Eggs Benedict, which I really enjoyed. The potatoes that came with it were perfectly flavored. My dad ordered the Mushroom omelette, which he enjoyed as well, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're really hungry. Aside from the valet, I really loved my food and experience at St Francis and definitely recommend it!",

    "text": "Arrived 25 minutes early for our 11am reservation for a baby 'sprinkle' for a girlfriend. Our intent was to ask if we could set up a few decorations prior to the other girls arriving. We were not greeted or acknowledged for 5-6 minutes and stood waiting at the host stand. At that point, the hostess came around the corner, trailed by the manager. We were ignored for an additional 2-3 minutes before the manager finally acknowledged us and asked if we had a reservation. We replied that we did. He then asked if our entire party had arrived and we replied that no, we were hoping to set up a few decorations prior to the rest of the group arriving. Had we been told in a professional manner something along the lines of 'oh, you know, we have you down for 11, so we're not quite ready' or 'unfortunately, the table's not ready yet', we would have been 100% okay with that. Instead, we were told, very rudely, 'welp. We can't seat you until the majority of your party is here.' My response was, 'okay. So we can't set the table up?' and he asked 'what are you setting up for?' (as we are standing with our arms full of baby gifts, diapers, etc). We told him a baby shower. He then went on the full defensive, stating that our reservation only says it's for six people. We confirmed that was correct. He then asked incredulously, 'for a baby shower??' Yeah, dude. Six people. Like the reservation says. He then replied 'are you even sure they're coming?? Because we're gonna give you the best seat in the house if it ends up just being the two of you, we can't give it to you.' 'Yes. We're sure they're coming.' 'Do you promise they're coming? Because we can't give you that table if they're not.' Are we in elementary school? Because my five year old wants to pinky promise everything, and I'm pretty sure that's what he was looking for.  At that point the hostess, who was clearly uncomfortable with the conversation, walked us to the [best] table and tried to recover as much as she could, offering her help to set up and making sure we had everything we needed. She was great. The server was also great. Very helpful and friendly. The 'best table in the house' however, was housed directly next to the live band (who were all EXTREMELY friendly and really were a good band) so we couldn't hear each other speak most of the time. Food was sub-par at best.  Worst part was that throughout the meal, he kept peeking around the corner and standing on his tiptoes to 'check the status' of our table from afar. We've all been in the industry and know what you're doing. We know you want to turn the table. However, we have all traveled from out of town, and from across town, to celebrate our friend and her pregnancy. And we're paying guests. With a reservation. So chill out.  Towards the end of our meal, the manager approached the table, leaned over and asked for the extra roll ups (that they failed to pull off the table upon seating us) that had been sitting there the entire time, WHILE we were eating, so he could take them to another table. Tell me you're not going to use those for other guests.  The final straw was when one of our party entered the restroom after he walked out, to an empty toilet paper roll on the dispenser, a half use roll propped up on the side, an un-flushed toilet and an empty soap dispenser.  Nothing would convince me to return.",

They still have salmon but it is not the same! Tonight we went and the service was awkward. Our server was awesome but different staff kept coming out and telling us that the food would be \"delayed by ten minutes\" due to a rush. Honestly the place was not that crowded and anyway we were on a date and not expecting fast food! The music was awful. Kool and the gang?? Seriously? We asked to change it which they did but who wants to listen to Kool and the Gang? I know this place sold so not sure if things will improve..we may be looking elsewhere for a fav date night spot.

They also have complimentary valet parking on site which I'm a huge fan of because I cringe at the idea of dealing with park garages in the city. Thanks St. Francis for a wonderful experience.

    "text": "Just had Sunday Brunch and ordered the Biscuit and Gravy with Eggs over medium and a Mimosa. I was dining alone so opted to sit at the outside patio bar, looking in to the main dining area. A pretty good spot for people watching.   My order showed up promptly but was only warm... Not hot? Was confusing, as again the order was out pretty quick.I'm therefore guessing the gravy is made in bulk and just ladled over the also pre-made, but kept warm biscuit. The eggs were cooked pefectly... But rather than taken from the skillet with a spatula, the eggs were poured onto the dish with all the butter they were basted in, creating a puddle on top of the gravy. While I like butter, and the dish is not on anyone's health-conscious menu, it was visually off putting... (See photos) but only just a little. Unfortunately they must have sat in the window or been under a fan or something because they, too, were not hot but only warm.   They next issue was the first bite I took... Which apparently was a bundle of sage or green onions? They were stringy and took some effort to chew up... Seriously chewy... I would have spit them into a paper napkin had I had one.   Ok, all of that pickiness aside, the dish was otherwise well done. Good flavor and consistency to the gravy with large chunks of sausage and the portion was big enough without leaving me in the need for a nap.  The only other issue was with the staff... While its early on a Sunday and the youngish hipster staff made polite acknowledgement of my presence at first, I felt quickly forgotten as I wasn't offered a refill on my beverage or given salt and pepper until I was halfway through the meal. Being a single diner (and former bartender) I easily got the impression I wasn't going to register on their radar unless I spent more or was part of a larger group. Not saying they were not friendly, just that most employees were busier with their own conversations than with the attention paid to the customers. I finished my meal and drink and sat waiting for the check a good five minutes with an empty plate and glass in front of me the whole time as well. While I may understand this at a table in the busy dining room, my server/bartender was no father than six feet from me the entire time.   I'll go back, as again the food is good... But I'll have to lower my expectations I guess.",

    "text": "First and foremost, let me just proclaim that the food here is top-notch delicious! We ordered the Moroccan meatballs, baked goat cheese and the famous pig dip. The meatballs were lip-smackingly good. The pig dip was like mana from heaven. So, two thumbs up (plus two toes up) for the excellent food.  Now, the reason I'm giving St. Francis just two stars is the service...it was ABOMINABLE. Our waitress was difficult to flag down or to even find. Since we couldn't find her, we asked another waitress to call her for us. The other waitress asked us what we wanted and we told her that we wanted a beer. She even gave her recommendation and said that she would take care of our order. From that time until we were done with our meal, we didn't see a trace of the said beer.  To seal our verdict on the disappointing service, when we asked for a paper bag to put our take-out boxes in (we had 2 big boxes of leftover pig dip), our waitress, who finally decided to show herself to collect the payment, said that they don't keep the paper bags up on the second floor (where we were seated) and that we could get a bag from the hostess from downstairs on our way out. All that time that she was giving us this lame excuse, we were thinking, \"Why couldn't she just go down and get the paper bags for us now?\" She was very inefficient, inattentive and unhelpful. For this reason, we don't think we'll be back to St. Francis.",

Note to St Francis: your HH menu is very confusing and misleading. I thought all food items on the lunch menu/HH menu were $3 off and you only showcase a few wines, even though every wine by the glass is half-off.  I was surprised to see my fingerlings weren't discounted even though they were on HH menu. Anyway, they need to work on hiring more staff and I would appreciate my server letting me know HH is ending so I can order another glass of wine for $5 she did give me my second glass at the HH price because it was just 6pm when I finally flagged her down.  The food is solid so I will return in the future but I must sit at the bar.",

I've been dreaming about the Moroccan meatballs that I had awhile back, so I ordered those. My husband got the Chile pork verde and we also got the fingerling potatoes. The pork and potatoes were good, but the meatballs dish didn't have the same flavor it use to have, the sauce lacked the seasoning that it normally has in it. Overall, I probably won't be back, which is unfortunate as it use to be a family favorite.",

I have been here before and I have waited for at least an hour to get a table for two but this time I reserved before coming. So yes, this place gets slammed during dinner time and if you mind waiting that long then reservation is highly recommended. Also, this place was on Guy Fieri's must visit list, so it needs no further description.   In the menu, few things were exceptional and some were just fine. Nothing was bad though, so overall four stars. We tried crispy fingerling potatoes which could have been crispier. Creamy corn soup and corn bread were good. In entree, Italian meat balls and veggie wild rice bowl were flavorful! For the  dessert, we had toffee pudding which was little sweeter than my liking but my husband loved it.   I hate to mention but this place was very noisy that day. One big group in particular was VERY loud that it was hard to hear across the table. That definitely made it less enjoyable.",

The other items on the board were good.  However, I asked the server whether any contained nuts as one in our party had allergies. The server said \"no\". Guess what.....nuts in the muffin.",

Very friendly staff, wide variety of drinks and food in the menu. Everyone in our group kept commenting on how everything from the appetizer to the dessert were just SO GOOD!   My wife and I had the baked goat cheese, the roasted salmon, the scallops and the apple tart and I couldn't tell you which one I liked the most! I want it all again!   We also got to try the roasted chicken and the moroccan meatballs, which some of our friends ordered, and those too were unbelievable!   I can't wait to go back! The only problem I'm going to have is when picking what to eat! Everything it's really good!!",

The flavor son this sandwich intensify with an added sweetness of some of the best caramelized onions I have ever eaten. Dip is nice, not too salty. Good dinner!",

    "text": "St. Francis Restaurant is one of the better dining establishments in Phoeniz, AZ.  You walk into the restaurant and you will be amazed by the very modern and open architecture.  I liked the open air concept here, but cannot imagine how hot it would get in the mid-Summer heat of Arizona.  The staff is energetic and friendly.  The food is innovative and comforting.    I started off my dining experience with an amaretto margarita.  I thought it was an intriguing drink, and I was super glad that I ordered it.  It was delicious and fun to drink (although I do not typically drink).  It was refreshing, and fun to have the almond liquor mix together!  What a great combo!  Grade:  A-  For my appetizer, I had the beet salad.  You got a two-collored beet salad (yellow and red), mixed with raddico, endive, and grapefruit and other delicious nuggets.  I really enjoyed the salad, as it was fresh and crisp.  My only minor complaint (see the photo) was that it was very sloppily plated and the portions were very small.  Grade:  B+  For my main meal, I ordered the white fish.  This dish was complex, well prepared, and fun to eat.  It was a seared white fish, placed upon a medley of different veggies.  It was beautiful to look at and the different textures in the dish made it a different experience with each bite.  For me personally, the only drawback was those big (lima?)beans that it was served with.  It was a bit tough and difficult to eat.  Otherwise, I enjoyed the meal!  Grade:  A-.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/st-francis-restaurant-phoenix?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#kFL8IsGdRelXeXDlg2njog\">yelp.com/biz_photos/st-f...</a>  Service was energetic and generally quick.  I had a good laugh at my waiter, as he became very distracted looking at people's behinds.  He lost his chain of thought serval times.  Hah - we're all human, right?!  Expect a very young and hit crowd here.    Food Grade:  B+ Service Grade:  B Worth the Money Grade:  B Overall Impression:  B",

Served on a bed of pureed cauliflower with spinach and grapefruit. An amazing summer dish. Light,  flavorful and the fish tasted  like it was caught a couple of hours ago.  Service and drinks were perfect. The fish was a reasonable $28, and if you haven't been to St. Francis the ambience for a date is really nice.",

First of all, the door is a little obscure, so my mom and I (who is visibly having chemo, by the way) entered the back door, but no big deal, we were shown to the host stand and were seated. A waiter gave us water and told us that our server would be with us in a moment. We sat. And sat. Someone came by and refilled my water. We sat. In the meanwhile, there were three waiters doing very little and standing around.  After 25 minutes, I scooted my chair back and told my mom we should go. Right then the waiter came to the table and leaned in, saying \"I apologize, ladies. Are you ready to order or have I waited too late and you're ready to go?\" He gave no excuses or reasons for the delay, and truth be told, I felt like he wanted us to go.  I have no idea what the problem was, if I was too fat, my mom too bald, or if we just weren't fancy enough, but I've never had a business treat me, a paying customer, this way. I will say that although most of the people there were dressed just a little nicer than we were, our clothes were clean and covered our bodies, and there was no posted dress code. I have no idea.  Management needs to look at their staff, if you ask me.",

The food kind of took a while to come out and I wish we went for happy hour, because there were a lot more options for entrees, in addition to being cheaper.   We started out with the fingerling potatoes, which were deliciously fried and complimented with lemon aioli. There were a lot on the plate, so definitely a shareable appetizer. We also got the chile burger, which was good but I didn't feel like there was anything special about it. The best item by far was the pork chile verde, but beware it has a little kick to it. The meat was really tender and the flavor was delicious. Even though it comes with cornbread, I wished I ordered a baguette to go with it. All in all, I would definitely come back to try some of the other items!",

St. Francis is good from top to bottom, side to side.  The ambience is wonderful and really fits the Phoenix location well.  Everything I have eaten here is excellent.  My personal top three are the Moroccan Meatballs, the Fingerling Potatoes, and the Pig Dip.  They are all three dishes that really show what St. Francis is all about and the quality of food they create.  All food is seasonal and prepared by intelligent professionals that are truly passionate about food.  Check out their happy hour and Market in Downtown Phoenix too.  Don't miss St. Francis!",

    "text": "This is a tough one to write. The food is outstanding. My wife and I went to St Francis on recommendations from friends. Also, the Chile Burger was listed as best burger in the state by a food website that I follow. The location is a little out of the way from our home but since we were downtown for the flea market, we thought we would stop in for lunch. The place is very cool. It has a very hipster modern vibe. All of the food is locally sourced and you can taste the freshness. We went on a Saturday and all they were offering was the Brunch menu. This was a great disappointment as many of the recommendations we received were not offered. My wife wanted the French Onion Burger and I wanted to try the Pig Dip. Neither were on the brunch menu which I can't be mad about, we should have done our research. The thing that bothered me was the service. When asked if they could make the FO Burger, our waitress seemed very offended. We received good service prior to asking, then from that point on, the service was very bad. Our waitress was very condescending and not welcoming. I ordered the St Francis Bloody Mary and the Green Chile burger, the burger was phenomenal. The Bloody Mary was strange and I don't think I would order it again. It had very strong citrus flavors with a serious kick on the end. It was a little too spicy for my liking. Back to the burger, I wouldn't argue that it was one of the best burgers in the state. The bun was freshly baked and the chiles were very sweet and flavorful. Everything on the burger was fresh and tasty. My wife had a salad and said it was average. She did like the addition of apples to more or less a cob salad. The salad didn't come with bread so we ordered some to take home. It was very good and very reasonable at $3 a loaf.  A Salad, Burger, Bloody Mary  and Tea was $44.00 before tip. It was a little pricey but I imagine you are paying for the locally sourced goods. The flavor of the food would be a strong 5 stars, value of food maybe 4 stars and service 1.5 stars. Going to round it out to 3 stars. I am not sure if we will go back.",

The wait staff was very nice though and they had a good happy hour deal on wince and let us order 2 glasses at once for each of us to beat the happy hour deadline. I ordered a scallop in brown butter dish. The first few bites were amazing, but whatever was in the brown butter sauce (I think some mayo) started to become over rich and gross. The scallops weren't cooked perfect either, golden on one side barely cooked on the other. We also had the Sticky Toffee pudding, nothing compared to Ramsay's in Paris, Las Vegas, but as our server pointed out, half the price, so not bad. So nothing really memorable, I would just go back if I was in the area with someone that wanted to try something new, otherwise I wouldn't seek it out.",

    "text": "Went for an early dinner late lunch.  This place has been on my list for a long time.  The place is small and not very charming.  The hostess looked like a sweetheart but wasn't very welcoming.  She asked if had reservations and the place was half empty.  It was around 430 on a monday.  Um no, why would we make reservations at 4:30 in the afternoon?  She told my wife she would see if she could get us a table outside.  Fine by us, in fact any of these half a dozen empty tables would work just fine.  The waiter on the other hand was phenomenal.  His name was Taylor I believe.  He was very kind, treated us well, knew the menu, and happy to see us unlike the hostess.  On to the food.  They had a happy hour with many items 25-50% off.  Kids under 10 are also free.  Double score for us.  We ordered goat cheese, potato fingerlings, pig dip, chile verde, and a kids pizza w/ a salad.  The goat cheese was tasty.  It had nuts, cheese, and tomato sauce with bread chips.  The kids salad was good too.  Unfortunately, my son's pizza was raw.  My wife and I both tried it and both spit it back in our napkins.  The crust was charred but the middle was doughy.  I dont think it was properly turned in the oven. He was loving the goat cheese and potatoes so we didnt bother telling the waiter.  The potatoes were awesome.  The slightly smashed them and fried them with rosemary, sage, and salt.  The chile verde was also very tasty.  Had a smokiness to it and very good chile flavors with good chunks of pork.  The pig dip did not taste fresh.  The bread was a bit burnt, much too big, and hard.  All the ingredients in it tasted a bit old.  I was also expecting thicker slices of pork and what there was wasnt thick or enough for how huge the bread was.  The dip was cold and didn't do much to add flavor or soften the rock hard bread.  Very disappointing.  The price was okay but if it wasnt on happy hour I'm not sure I would have been thrilled for the product.  St francis was underwhelming for both my wife and I.  My son loved it, the chile was good, potatoes were tasty, and our waiter was excellent but the rest fell flat.  Probably wouldnt recommend or go out of my way for it again.",

First of all, the menu is really limited. I am not crazy about my diet, but I like a little balance. I couldn't find anything other than a carb on the whole menu! Baked goat cheese with bread, 3 different kinds of flatbreads, bread with dipping oil. Bread, bread, bread.....My friend and I ordered the chicken flatbread which was very tasty. I also got the St. Francis lemonade with the honey infused vodka, which is reason enough to return. It was ridiculously good...I think I had 6. The service was not super attentive and not very friendly either. I think stern would be a good way to describe the bartender.  Anyway, the space is gorgeous and the drinks are strong. Maybe I will go back for dinner when they offer the full menu.",

Recommended by the innkeeper at Mariposa Manor (B&B walking distance away) the night before board certification examination. Recommendations by waitstaff were top notch and I got exactly what I wanted based on the mood I was in at the time. Delicate flavors, locally sourced items when possible and a vegetarian friendly menu all made this a wonderful experience. My water glass was kept full. My server was attentive without being intrusive. Ambience a little noisy but not distractingly so.",

The food was good, I had the pork chili verde and he had the burger with bacon and fried onions. The French fries were rustic, with the skins on them, I liked them better than most restaurant fries.  The peaches in the peach cobbler weren't ripe enough, they were hard and tart. The crisp and the vanilla ice cream was very tasty on top of the peaches. I will get a different desert next time. I will definitely come back.",

My husband had the onion burger and I had the pork chili verde. The fries were AMAZING and he loved the burger but the green chili pork was greasy and tasted average. Not much green chili flavor. I had two eggs on top that were cooked to a rubber consistency. The service was below average as we were forgotten frequently and left with empty water and pop glasses.  The tables are very close together and you can hear other people's conversations. We will try it again but make sure we have time to sit and wait for service.",

    "text": "First visit here was on a Saturday at 7 with a group of 10 for a birthday.  We had a table in the upstairs section which was really nice.  They allowed us to bring balloons and confetti and other decorations and set the table up before the guest of honor arrived.  They also allowed us to bring our own cupcakes.  Service was great - we only had two hours for the entire meal because we had a tight schedule for the other festivities of the night.  The waitress had no problem with that, took our drink and entree orders right away, and everything came out super quick.  Unfortunately we didn't order apps due to the time constraint.  But most of us shared our entrees and they were great almost across the board.  The winner of the night in everyone's mind was the Forbidden Rice which had the most exotic, refreshing, floral type of taste (jasmine maybe?).  I personally had the green chile stew which was spiced perfectly and the portion was deceivingly hearty despite it's small size.  The wifey ordered the whitefish which was cooked well and the broth was fantastic.  However, there was a large hunk of fish spine (bone) attached to the fillet which was incredibly off putting.  We didn't speak up about it because everything else was so good and it was easy for my wife to close her eyes while I removed the offending bone.  The salmon salad had a huge portion of grilled salmon atop greens and though I didn't taste it because I'm not a salmon fan, my friend really enjoyed the dish.  The loser of the night was the \"Wood Roasted Seasonal Vegetables\" side dish, which was a plate of incredibly over cooked mushy brussel sprouts (which is \"vegetable\" singular not \"vegetables\" plural) that seemed braised and not roasted on account of the mushiness.  All had a great time and I look forward to trying St. Francis again.",

The place has a great look.  Very loft-like and contemporary.  When we sat, we ordered fingerling potatoes which were just okay.  I didn't realize that they would be such large pieces of potatoes (my fault).  I had the skirt steak which was good, but not great, while others had the pork stew and the pork chop.  They were both good, but once again not great.  The best part of my meal was the creamed spinach.  It wasn't actually creamy, but very whipped.  It was delicious.

    "text": "This is an amazing restaurant. I wanted to wait until I had been several times to write a review to ensure it was fair and that I wasn't just overly impressed with my first few visits.  I have been more than 20 times. Several times for brunch, three times for dinner, and a lot of lunch visits. Always great service and the menu is terrific. I love the bacon burger and brunch options are all fantastic.  The baked eggs are amazing and I love the pork chile verde for brunch. It comes with a slice of corn bread and is terrific.   My only complaint (although I find it important) is that I do not appreciate that the kitchen serves meals for children first. We often take the kids for brunch and I sometimes forget to tell the server that we would like our meals served together. Otherwise, the kids meals come out IMMEDIATELY.  I will be honest, I don't understand this. Especially at such a lovely restaurant.  I have talked to the servers about it before and while they are happy to make the adjustment, unless you ask, your children's meals are brought before the adult meals.  I dislike this for two main reasons: (1) assuming I allow my children to eat their meal first, after my children have finished their meal, they are less likely to sit in their chairs properly and be entertained while we eat, but FAR MORE IMPORTANTLY, (2) I believe children should learn proper manners, which includes that it is not polite to eat a meal until all those at the table are seated and served. Even my two-year old can observe this rule so it is frustrating that a restaurant believes we should be encouraging children to eat when others are not.    Overall, a lovely restaurant. Wonderful, seasonal menu. Great space. Kid-friendly. Great wine list. Visit. Go now.",

To start on a positive note the prices were very reasonable and the sides, while miniscule, were very flavorful. Except for the fingerling potatoes which were very undercooked.  The service was adequate but not more.  There were four of us and two ordered the pork chop, I went for the steak and our fourth took the seafood soup.  The chops and steak lacked flavor although the portions were good. The soup was quite nice.  We shared two desserts. Nothing memorable and they did not have espresso... that, for us, was the final flat note.    So, While I should  give them another chance to see if we just hit a bad night I can't bring myself to do it... Maybe next month.",

    "text": "This past Saturday I had dinner in the Meat Packing District in Manhattan!  Oh no I am mistaken - actually I was right here in Phoenix at a fantastic little place called St. Francis.  Forgive my confusion, but I as I sat in this architectural joy with exposed brick, glass, inside out side bar, and the much talked about pulley suspended loft, I could not help to think i must not be in Phoenix.   Turns out I was and make no mistake this place is must more than just a pretty face.  Although not a very large menu - several items called to me from the page - so we let the server do the driving for us.  The goat cheese app was a perfect beginning, and as we were about 3 crostinis short on the cheese to bread balance, our server was quick to bring a few more, so that precious cheese would not go to waste.   My wife had the Seafood soup which was absolutley a joy.  Even good restaurants these days fall short of truly inspired flavor and this dish loaded with fresh seafood in a delicate yet savory broth was just amazing.  It had a personality all its own familiar yet a little exciting at the same time.  For me it was the Pork chop with the finest polenta I have every had.  If there is a filet mignon of pork chops this was it.  Since my wife is having a baby any minute now I had a glass of Tempronillo which I thought was nice option on a wine by the glass list.  We finished off with a simple but perfectly done apple-crisp ala mode.  After our meal we sat back with the quite satisfaction and grin of the chesire cat.   Nothing needed to be said we were in culinary paradise.    If that is not enough - the real magic of this place is the synergy of it all.  The food is amazing, the room has snap, but it all comes together with a diverse crowd unassuming yet hip (I hate that word).  A lovely group of four older people, next to my wife and I, sharing the energy with a young couple certainly on their first date and 4 ladies out for the evening.  Yes we all know Phoenix is growing and getting better every day, but this place is forcing its hand.  The city was alive and vibrant and best of all real , in this little masterpiece.    This is the kind of place I want to be a regular at - not because I want to be known there, but because I want to get to know it better.",

I can't wait to come here when it warms up and the garage door front can be lifted. We ordered a carafe of the house chardonnay and dinner, no apps. The guys both got the burger, which looked amazing and was served with a bowl of nice crispy fries and some of the best ketchup I've had. One person had the Arctic Chard salad and I had the roasted chicken. The salad had a great flavor and so many veggies that I was sorry I didn't order it myself. I personally didnt love the chicken, I'm not a dark meat fan and chicken skin kind of grosses me out.  but the green whipped potatoes were excellent- just wished there had been more of them!

I wasn't super hungry, so I ordered the flatbread with fig and goat cheese, and it just didn't impress.

The staff is genuinely friendly and helps keep the place from going from hip to pretentious, clad in their white t-shirts and jeans. The food. Oh, the food. St. Francis must be the patron saint of deliciousness, the best food you might have ever had. The menu is sparse and simple, A couple chicken, beef, fish, vegetarian options. But once you experience the food you realize there is no need to be any more elaborate. So many adjectives come to mind, exquisite, phenomenal, amazing, and they're all accurate. So do yourself a favor. Don't take it from me and the all the other yelpers, go to St. Francis and experience the immaculate mastication. After all, eating is believing.",

    "text": "Located across Camelback from AJ's, watch the quick turn in if you are heading East on Camelback.   SWCE (she who controls everything) AKA Ms. Ambiance noted the place was chic downstairs and many of our group noted how much quieter it was upstairs (on the other hand, I felt like...Hey, I want to be where the action is, not in the loft, SWCE and I like to be in the middle of things). Lots of pretty faces and short dresses and this seasons thing boots. (me likey).   Everyone enjoyed their meal, Ms. Foodie noted that her mystery rice dish could have been better described by either the menu or our server. She and another in our party enjoyed the dish but was surprised by the black rice. I had the flat iron steak and it was just excellent, cooked well, peppery, just great.   Mr. Wine collaborated with \"the organizer\" to select two great, very moderate reds a Malbec and a Pinot. Both around $3., Liked the Malbec so much, I just might have to find where to purchase several bottles.   All agreed we had a great experience and were pleasantly surprised at the $85 bill per couple including tip.   Random thoughts:   The wine list could be more expansive (first expressed by Ms. Organizer) , specifically a few higher end selections. I initially thought the same of the menu but after perusal reconsidered.   The servers and hostess staff were uniformly hot, understated and wearing tight shirts. I'm thinking this does not follow the law of averages, somebody must of thought this out. Nice touch.   Off to untox.",

The ambience and atmosphere are both relaxing, hip, and trendy, and yet, you don't feel you have to be uppity to enjoy.  The food is phenomenal. I have had the baker's board which is absolutely divine. The Iron skillet pancake is superb, making you double take on how a chocolate pancake can taste so good.  Additionally, I have had the chile burger which is by far one of the most delicious burgers I have ever had.  All in all, this place is a gem and I count the days till I go again!",

We went there in early March 2014, on a cooler AZ night. even though we had a reservation they wanted to seat us upstairs where it is a bit lonely and the ambiance is missing, and it was colder than downstairs. We asked for a table downstairs and were seated right next to the OPEN door to the patio. on top of it there was a fan blowing above our heads, all of that at a felt 60 Degrees inside. Not sure why they need a fan in the AZ winter and why they need TWO large open doors to the patio. Everyone around us was freezing, and putting their jackets on and finally someone of the restaurante rediuced the fan speed (which helped a bit).  Oh yes and they forgot to bring our appetizer before our main dish too, so service was ok - not great.   Having said that, the food was very good, and innovative.  the patio looks great and cosy so I will return when it is warmer outside. if they seat me outside - GREAT - if they seat me inside, I am ok with that too and actually might want the open door and the fan.   so 4 stars for the food 2 stars for the temperature  3 for service",

Made reservations through Yelp and it actually worked! Arrived 15min. prior and within 5min. we were sitting down. Sat at the balcony and we were not expecting the great view we got. A large mirror above the bar was placed strategically so as to give a great view of the cleavages down below. I for nice warm spring days in Phoenix I definitely recommend you ask to be seated here.  I ordered the Roasted Salmon Superfood which was obviously prepared by the chef to cater to their Ninja clientele. It was cooked perfect (see attached photo) on top of quinoa, avocado, spinach and sweet chile vinaigrette. Afterwards I decided to treat myself to dessert and I had the Cheesecake in a jar. It was recommended by our waitress. Service was great on a busy night, Can't wait to try the rest of the menu next time I am in town and the price for the quality of the food you are getting is excellent.  St. Francis, you patron saint of all animals. You definitely know how to serve the wonderful slaughtered creatures God's provided us. For that this Ninja will award you 4 Ninja stars and for Executive Chef Chris Barch, you sir are just two miracles away from Sainthood yourself. maybe on this Ninja's next visit we can bring you that much closer to God.",

The wait wasn't too painful..maybe 15 minutes for brunch. We were seated upstairs with our daughter-which kind of stunk. The tables are crammed very close together. They were out of high chairs, so we ended up using a booster seat; not terrible, but not ideal for a short 2 year old.   One very cute thing for kids is the toy box at the entrance. It certainly helped distract our kiddo while we waited for a table-so much so that she wanted to keep going back to it.  Food was really great-I had the baked tomato egg dish, and my husband had the iron skillet pancake. He liked it, but felt it would be just too rich to get again. One of those \"I gotta try it just once\" sort of dishes.  It took a very long time to place our order, the waiter never came back to check on us, and our drinks were never refreshed.  This place has a really great patio, and a really cool vibe all around.  Complimentary valet was also a nice touch since the lot is tiny.  I'll definitely give it another try.",

    "text": "So, after several trips to this place I figured I would pen a review.  You know what they say, one happy customer tells ten friends and one unhappy one tells 100.  Here are my thoughts:    First outing was for breakfast, party of four-food was good, service was pretty good as well.  Little pricey for breakfast, but we had drinks...  Second visit, dinner and it was just ok.  food was good, atmosphere was good, service was lacking (especially for what they charge for food and drinks).  Third visit, party of three for dinner-short wait at the bar for a table, ordered an old fashioned and it was pretty mediocre.  Were seated after ~15 min, hostess brought us menu's and indicated we would be served shortly.  After making eye contact with several of the waiter's passing our table, and leaving the menu's hanging off the table, in the universal sign that says \"we're ready to order\", I got frustrated and decided to leave.  On the way out I mentioned my experience to the hostess and she gave me a doe eyed look and asked if I wanted to speak to the manager... At that point I was hungry and in no mood for that discussion.  Went down the street to the Windsor and had amazing service, good drinks and a great night.    I feel I've given this place a fair shake, and have no desire to return.",

Unfortunately, I made the mistake of ordering the chicken salad sandwich. It was literally GOOPY with what appeared to be aoli, although the menu states it is lemon vinaigrette?       I took my first bite and the large pieces of chicken OOZED out onto the plate because of all the aoli. I had to recompose the sandwich after each bite and finally I just gave up and ate the meat and bread separately. (I was very hungry) The side salad was good, but nothing special. It seems like such a cool little place,maybe I just chose the wrong thing.      In my opinion, If you want to leave that item on your menu,,the currants and apricots were a good addition, it needed a little something crunchy in it and maybe some herbs, I could not taste any zatar spices and reduce the amount of dressing by about 90%.",

    "text": "St. Francis SUCKS!!!!!!  Have been there 3 or 4 times now, and have gone from... \"oh they are a new place, they'll figure it out\" ...to NEVER AGAIN!  The past is the past so I'll just talk about Brunch today.      Arrived @ 1:00 : not as busy as I've seen it in the past.   (waited several minutes @ the door because there is only one person seating people.) Inquire about the patio (even though I know it's a lost cause)  Hostess was sweet & apologetic that outside is full but offers the 3 of us a table right inside the open wall next to the patio.      We sit and begin to browse the menu & enjoy the jazz band that is part of the brunch appeal.  Several minutes go by (they are not packed, but still very busy) our server stops by & takes our drink order & drops off  H2O. Comes back in a timely fashion with my mimosa & my friend's iced tea.  We're ready to order, but she doesn't ask & takes off (no big deal) until she does not return for a really long time.  I understand we are not the only people she is taking care of & quite possibly something is happening that we can't see (large party etc. ) so we do our best to be patient.  The server returns & takes our order.      40 min. later my turkey scramble (scrambled eggs w/ turkey, spinach & cheese) and a bowl of oatmeal with toasted bananas on top arrive; but not the pancake that the 3rd person in our party ordered.  The person (not our server) that dropped it off informs us that the pancake will...and I quote \"be out in a minute and a half\" we spend that 90 sec. discussing how odd it was to bring part of the order instead of waiting for everything to be ready.    EIGHT MINUTES LATER....(yes now I am looking @ my watch because I'm starving & we are not going to be rude & eat while one person watches) the pancake arrives.    During that time we are doing what we can to ignore the food that is and isn't there & are teased twice by people trying to deliver  food that doesn't belong to us.  It seemed to me that close to 50% of the food leaving the kitchen goes 1st to a wrong table & then the right one.  (could maybe explain the 40 min. wait for simple menu items????)  Once the last plate arrives our server breezes by and cheers \"yea\"  seemingly happily surprised that all of our food is now on the table.   As I dig into my eggs (fully expecting them to be cold) I find that they are somehow still lukewarm (I'm psyched)  Until I realize that the puddle on the plate is not excess moisture from the turkey & the spinach but raw egg!!!       THe server stops by to offer me another mimosa which I quickly agree to because I am completely disgusted & annoyed.      I realize that I am @ fault for not sending my plate back, but seriously, who has that kind of time??? We have already been there an hour & my friends have somewhere to be.    My one friend comments that his oatmeal even w/toasted bananas on it is very bland.  Then tells us about how gross the pot roast was which was what he had ordered on his last dinner visit.  My other friend is bound & determined to love the pancake he waited 48min. for & wolfs it down without comment.  I eat the toasted baguette that was the only other thing on the plate with my eggs.    \"Hey chef!  People eat W/their eyes too.  Would? some kind of garnish be too much trouble?  (preferably something edible since the main dish was not!)      Someone comes & takes our plate & does not notice or perhaps chooses not to inquire about my uneaten eggs.  Also, no one seemed to notice over the course of an hour that our water & iced tea needed  refilling.    The check arrives and no surprise the pancake is on it.  So we pay and leave.  I entertained the idea of speaking to a manager until my friend points out that we had not seen anyone that resembled that role the entire time we were there. (maybe that is why the pancake was not taken off?? manager called in sick???)      I get why people want to like this place, but there are soooo many other places that are just as cute where the servers aren't clueless and the food is delicious & on time. I guess it's a bit more of a drive but I'd rather spend 15 more min. in the car than 40min. waiting for raw eggs.      I agree w/ Jeff D. that it is easy to pass St Francis at 40 miles an hour.  It is my recommendation that you make it 60!  :c",

I had read about this place in Java Magazine and was fully informed of the owner and chef, his history and all the writer's recommendations.   We had the baked Goat cheese app and it seemed that the entire bar followed suit.  We just loved it!  I had worked my way down the drink list and was feeling pretty good about most everything that night and I am not ashamed to say so!  Most all the House Specialty drinks were Yummy,Unique, and filled with liquid fun.  We had the Pot Roast and the Pork Chop.  Loved them both!  I cannot say a single thing bad about this place.  The bar is lovely, the staff was great, and chatty and attentive and hard working.    I cannot wait to bring my little one there..the kids menu looked awesome    So glad to have a great place to eat here in the hood...",

Went back last night with a large group for a birthday party and enjoyed a topnotch dining experience.   The hostess was very polite and promptly seated us. The servers were uber-friendly and enthusiastic about working there. They were also on the mark throughout the dinner.   St. Francis is a welcomed addition to the central Corridor dining scene. The indoor/outdoor vibe at the bar and lounge area/patio seating is great during Spring weather.   Everyone at the dinner enjoyed their meals. My girlfriend and I shared an incredible romaine salad. Crisp bacon and yummy white cheddar ranch dressing. (Sorry we split this salad, next time I am ordering a whole salad for myself!)   For dinner I ordered the green chili pork stew. The heat level was right on and the pork was savory. The corn bread was okay. In all, liked it better than Roaring Fork's green chili stew.   My girlfriend ordered the pot roast. The meat was tender -- the glazed gravy was delicious. Served on a nice piece of toasted Texas toast. Carrots were cooked to perfection.   Missed out on dessert because the hostess brought a red velvet birthday cake, but we will be back!",

The caesar salad made with kale was so salty that we were not able to eat much of it. The romaine salad was okay, nothing special. The entree, halibut was so dry it was totally inedible.

Living so close to it - and wanting to check out the buzz - St. Francis was not a disappointment. The valet service and hipster scene was a tad offputting upon our arrival, but the decor and beatiful interior of St. Francis was enjoyable to dine in. Large glass windows, renovated historic brick walls, and an open kitchen gave the experience of dining in a more restaurant-known city, say San Francisco. We were seated in between Mayor Phil Gordon and his two bodyguards, so, hey, if Mayor Phil thinks something of St. Francis...My girlfriend and I both ordered the Cioppino, and, wow. It was amazing. Rich and tomatoey, herby and chock full of seafood treats, I found myself scraping the sides of the cast iron pot at the end. It was really a treat. It's nice to have some semblance of a restaurant scene in central Phoenix, and St. Francis is definitely leading the pack.",

The ambiance is nice as well.  The restaurant has it;s finer points, however it is way over priced for the food you get.  I had flat bread and baked goat cheese.  Neither were bad, they just were not great either.   Our tab was almost $70 for 4 drinks and two appetizers.   The service was really slow.  When we were finished and the waitress brought our check, the bus boy came around and started taking everything from the table, including what was left of my wine I was still finishing. Granted there was not much left in the glass to speak of and I wasn't paying attention when he came around.   But hello, we are still sitting here.  You bus the table when people leave, not while they are finishing up.  I understand removing dinner plates and things of that nature, but they were removing everything on the table. I just find that rude.   Anyhow, I would go back for drinks, but not for food.  There are much better places to eat in town for the price then this place.  .",

    "text": "Although the space itself is really beautiful, My first visit to St. Francis left me longing for the tiny digs and reliably excellent food of Matt's. On the plus side, our party of 6 was seated without wait, the wait staff provide lots of good eye candy and the service was friendly and prompt.  The food was just ok.  I had the fried egg sandwich which comes with their roasted fingerling potatoes and small ramekins of their 'Mexican ketchup' and chipotle mayo. Everything on the plate was boring. There are just too many ways to make a great breakfast potato, so these bland, unseasoned fingerlings were disappointing and neither condiment wowed me. I thought it odd that no salt or pepper were on any table and I thought I might insult the chef by asking for them.  I assumed the absence of such basic 'comforts' must mean they believe everything is coming out of the kitchen perfectly seasoned. Guess again guys. It is never a good thing when a table full of famiodis foodies take in an entire meal at a new place without a single rave or a 'holy socks Batman, this is killer!!'.  Nope, not a single holy anything in the beautifully styled St. Francis. My other non food related negatives are the lack of parking and the VERY uncomfortable seating. They do offer complimentary valet service in their postage stamp sized lot but it looked like a crazed chess game as we waited (in the rain)  for a stupid long time for the valet to 'free' our cars. The seating is bench style, on which there are no backs, so you are either practicing perfect posture throughout you meal or you are leaning into the backs of perfect strangers. Either way, it is weird and uncomfortable. All in all , I most likely wouldn't go out of my way to go back.",

The menu is limited and we sat as a table where the bench on one side was backless. I don't know what person wants to pay $30+ per person and not be able to lean back during dinner. The drinks are pricey and not terrible strong or large. :( The valet only thing is redic, as one yelper put it \"We're not in Paradise Valley, people. Look to your right. Your evening's backdrop is a busy six lane street-cum-drag strip and Castle Boutique.\"  The potato app our friends ordered was so/so. The best thing i tried was the stew, which also happens to be the cheapest thing  on the menu at $12. Drinks are $9-11.  Service was decent and the staff friendly. They brought my friend the wrong wine and caught it before she took a sip. I would give 2.5 stars but I feel like they're not sure if they want to be postino's, tuck stop or fez. All 3 places are better. I think I'll come back and just look cool at the bar for $20. If they expanded the menu I may reconsider. Over all: not bad, not great. Fun to try a new spot though.",

After reading all the positive reviews on Yelp I really had high expectations so I am hoping I just  went on an off night. The building is lovely and the design was right up my alley but it all went awry from there. First it took forever to get ANY service at all on a night when they weren't even half full. When I finally did get my drink it was too strong to drink. Now, I usually am never one to bitch about a drink being too strong so you know it had to be bad!  The flatbread was awesome and I was all geared up for my porkchop but, alas, was disappointed. It was way undercooked which also gave it an odd, mushy texture. The polenta was basically flavorless. Nothing more than paste on a plate. I will say my dining companions' pot roast was pretty good and my man said his ciopinni was adequate, nothing great, but reasonable. I enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding but have had better. Overall, a pretty disappointing experience when I was all set to give them 5 stars! Maybe I'll try it again someday but with so many other places on my list to try, I doubt it.",

A few months ago we were given a Local First \"Devour Phoenix\" gift card from friends.  It's valid at a handful of locally owned Phoenix restaurants including St. Francis...according to the website that accompanies the gift card.  I arrived at Wednesday at 6:30 pm and couldn't help but feel that the restaurant was slow.  I sat at the bar and waited for my husband to arrive.  He walked in at 6:45 and we decided to stay at the bar.  It's warm and welcoming!    Before we ordered we presented the bartender with our gift card. \"Does St. Francis would honor this card because from past experience we know that just because a website lists a restaurant as a participant it doesn't mean that you can actually redeem the gift card there?\"  The bartender assured us that they would accept it.  We responded with gratitude adding that the \"worst case scenario\" would be for us to have ordered and then either have to argue with restaurant staff to redeem the card or pay the full value of the check ourselves.  The former really ruins an evening out...and she agreed.  We smiled at each other.  All was good.   With our gift card validated, we each ordered wine; my husband had a delicious Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.  I asked to sample the  Zinfandel and one of their Pinots.  I know the difference between a fresh bottle and one that's been open too long and it was clear that both of my samples had reached their shelf lives.  The bartender assured me that they were open that morning.  I believed her.  Shame on me for going with the Zinfandel which I knew didn't taste right.  We then had the goat cheese which was as I remembered served with a variety of breads.  It arrived quickly and was hot and delicious.  Then came time to order dinner.  No specials on a Wednesday night so we proceeded to order off the main menu.  We had some questions, and they weren't exactly esoteric.  For example, was it possible to add a side of salmon to the roasted vegetables?  How was the chicken prepared?    The bartender had no idea.   After ample confusion over adding salmon to the roasted vegetables, we opted to make things simple and order the shrimp and avocado salad with salmon on top.  I had the filet.  Order in, wine flowing, we're ready for a great evening!  I finished my glass and had a glass of the Truchard Pinot Noir.  She opened a fresh bottle and it was perfect!    Then we talked and enjoyed.  But soon we asked \"is it taking a long time for our food?\"  The bartender mentioned that they had a private party upstairs...but it seemed quiet.  We were the only ones at the bar and the tables downstairs were half full...but we're not in the restaurant business, so what do we know?    Finally someone comes out of the kitchen.  She's carrying a salad with salmon on top.  Ours?!  She says to bartender in a voice loud enough for us to hear \"There's no more salmon.  Tell the guys at the bar there's no more salmon.\"  She then takes the last salmon to a table in the dining room.  :(  The bartender tells us what we already know:  they're out of salmon.  OK, no problem.  Instead we opt for extra shrimp. :) New order in!  We wait but eventually we start to ask \"is this taking a long time?\"   Finally the meal arrives.  The filet was perfectly cooked, hot and delicious.  Great mashed potatoes!  The shrimp salad left a little to be desired.  It was small.  And the extra shrimp?  I couldn't find them.  All the shrimp were cut in half lengthwise.  Is that a thing?  It seemed like they were being cheap.    We finish and ask for the check.  Wrong amount.  We get a new check. I present the gift card.  CHAOS ENSUES!  The bartender can't figure out how to redeem it.  The waitress can't figure it out either.  They devise a plan.  They hit all the buttons.  My husband is tired and goes home.  I wait.  I wait some more.  When finally I think we've arrived at a solution the bartender tells me that the owner won't accept her solution.  He'll be at the restaurant in 5 to solve this.  I wait 15 and finally the owner arrives.  He introduces himself as asks for time to figure this out.  I wait 15 more.  He reemerges and explains that he's a new owner and doesn't know what this gift card is.  WORST CASE SCENARIO.    To his credit, he eventually accepts the gift card charging me a dollar more than I owe but giving me an extra dollar back in cash?    He wants my honest assessment.  I tell him I'm not angry but that the restaurant business is competitive and he's got to figure out the small stuff to survive.  He offers a gift card.  I decline.  I didn't want to come back. :(  Forget the delicious filet and appetizer or cool bar, what will we remember about tonight? Old wine, no salmon, slow service, poor service and inability to accept your own gift card.  For an established restaurant, even with new owners, this is tragic.  Pray for St. Francis.",

I visited with some friends for brunch and was not disappointed. There is a small private lot in front, and valet is available in the evenings. I ordered the Eggs Benedict which comes with a topping choice of pork, salmon or avocado. I got the avocado and was happy to find that it came with a generous pouring of hollandaise and a side of their delicious crispy fingerling potatoes.   Because of the beautiful setting, this would be a great place to come for birthdays of celebrations. My friends mentioned that she had celebrated her 21st here with some friends. At our table we also had an All American Breakfast and a Chorizo Scramble which were both delicious and came with a large piece of sourdough toast. One of my friends ordered a side of the fingerling potatoes and it came as a good portion, I recommend trying these if it doesn't already come with your meal! All of our plates were eaten clean.",

We arrived and the place smells fantastic. It is literally mouth-watering. The ambiance, especially when everything is opened on a nice day, is fantastic.   We were told that we had ten minutes left on the happy hour (which is fantastic, good assortment of drinks, apps, and entrees). We said we'd need a minute and our waiter disappeared for about 20 minutes. He said he'd sneak us onto the happy hour prices, but was confused when we reminded him about it at the end of the meal.   The food is quite good (although I wish the portions were a little bigger). We ordered the fresh baked bread, which is a must here. I had a really good fish dish (fortunately, I ordered the sauce on the side. It was not my cup of tea...er... sauce). And I even thoroughly enjoyed the quinoa that came with it (which is a rare occurrence). My wife got a flatbread that smelled better than it tasted. Our other guests seemed pretty happy with their meals. That said, nothing blew me away.   On this occasion, it was so slow. The waiter forgot one of our drinks (a fairly expensive shot of tequila), and it took us over 40 minutes to get our food after when we ordered. No real excuse was given for what took so long. And our food was all delivered at different times. That was all the more unfortunate as we had an event to get to afterwards, for which we were late.",

I don't understand how any organization could be run so incompetently and still have an unnecessarily long wait time to be served garbage. The wait staff seemed completely uninterested in our order or our needs. We got some truffle fries and unfortunately they were oversalted to the point of being inedible. Trying to get them re-done so that we could actually have fries we could eat was a hassle and they acted like we were an inconvenience to them. Our first order was a shrimp and avocado salad which can only be described as devoid of flavor. When the tastiest item present is red onion, you know you're in dire straits. We also got the forbidden rice bowl which came out as a pile of mush with a few pieces of vegetable noticeable. The only saving grace was the cucumber cooler cocktail that we ordered was drinkable. I have had meals five times as good for half the price. I would not go here unless I was literally trying to waste money. I would recommend the chipotle across the street or literally licking the street instead of going to this restaurant. The whole place needs to be redone, from the management to the waitstaff to the cooks to the people who own the building and those who clean up the floor.  We need a complete overhaul to make this place slightly bearable. Honestly just knock it down and start over from scratch  Tl,dr: I wish I would've hit my head on the way out so I wouldn't have any memories of this place.",

    "text": "Pretty bummed about my experience here today. I have had this place bookmarked forever so I was excited to finally get a chance to dine-in for brunch. Unfortunately, my experience here wasn't so great.   My husband and I parked in the back lot so we walked through the restaurant to the host check-in and noticed on our walk in a bunch of empty tables. I thought to myself, \"Great! There won't be a wait...\" So, I was a little surprised when the hostess told us there would be a 30-minute wait. Thinking to myself it was probably an overestimation (as I have discovered many restaurants do these days) we agreed to wait.  It's important to note I am currently 7 1/2 months pregnant and quite uncomfortable standing for long periods. So, when told we'd have a 30-min wait, I looked around and asked if there was a place I could sit while waiting for our table. Again, a bunch of the tables in the main dining area were free and there was actually a two-top with a nice booth backing right near the host station that was also vacant (that I specifically asked if we could sit at). Instead, the hostess directed my husband and I to sit at a counter with tall bar stools (not so comfy) that overlooked the kitchen. Mind you, these seats were less than 2-yards from the other, more comfortable 2-top I asked about AND they were serviced by the same waiter! He asked if we wanted to order drinks and eventually took our food order.   Now these stool counter seats were a bit awkward since we were basically directly overlooking the chef that works the fire oven. Which would have been fine if he was friendly, fun, cool, gave samples, or customer-oriented. Except, he was clearly not at all interested in us asking him any questions or watching him do his thing - and these seats sort of forced us to literally watch his every move, observe his work space, and view the entire kitchen. Honestly, it was kind of torturous watching all the delicious food being prepared and delivered to tables while we sat and waited for a real table for nearly 40-minutes.   The server we were assigned at this counter top also wasn't super welcoming or forthcoming about the expected wait time for a real table or food. He also forgot to bring me a coffee refill and didn't check in on us much.   Finally, after 40-minutes of waiting in uncomfortable seats, starving, feeling tortured by all the food we had to just look at - I was getting HANGRY! I made a bit more of a fuss. I asked the hostess if we could get an actual table. She apologized and told us the kitchen was backed up and she didn't want us to have to wait longer once seated at a table for food - (which makes no sense to me) - and we explained we had already ordered food from our \"server\" and just wanted an actual table in the dining area. She promptly seated us at one of the several open tables and our food was delivered about 10 minutes later.   The food itself was actually very good. I can see why this place does well overall because the flavors and quality are definitely great. I am also guessing from all the other reviews that our service is not the typical experience most guests have while dining here.   Still, I probably won't return. The fact that I am visibly very pregnant and they were ok with us:  -waiting for so long in uncomfortable, awkward seats with many other open table options -didn't update us on expected wait-times -didn't explain up front that the kitchen was what was super backed up -didn't offer a comped drink or app or extra apologies to make up for the crappy service   ...definitely didn't leave us feeing like we were very welcomed, valued customers. Bummer.",

We weren't greeted after being seated for an extended period of time.  Other tables hadn't been pre-bussed and looked understandably upset.  It was difficult to get service.  When we were finally able to get someone's attention, it was awkward, nervous and standoffish.  Not exactly the warm welcome one would expect.  Drinks then took forever as the bar seemed to be backed up.  They then ran out of wine glasses and served a Cabernet in a champagne flute!  It also happened to be ice cold.  When we finally paid and left, all the dirty plates from our dinner remained on the table.    The food was good, but unfortunately the kitchen's good work was overshadowed by the FOH's complete failure.  Not once was a manager visible helping to clear tables, make drinks, check on guest, etc.  If there was an effort to get things back on track, all would have been forgiven, but it seemed like they just didn't care.  The bathroom was also filthy and there was no paper towel.  I think this place's glory days have come and gone.  We won't be back.  EDIT:  I just read that this place had been recently sold.  Of course!  That explains the 180 degree change from previous experiences.  Don't go in expecting the St. Francis of the past.",

I went in about 2 weeks ago and my girlfriend ordered the meatballs which come with a delicious pearl pasta underneath. After receiving the dish we noticed it did not have the pasta. We asked our waiter, she went to the kitchen, then came back and informed us they no longer include that.... It was one of the main reasons we ordered it and clearly printed still on the menu as the description. I expressed my displeasure with the discrepancy got an apology from the waitress, who actually had perfectly good service, but nothing was done about it except we were offered free sherbert after dinner if we wanted.  Fast forward two weeks and I really wanted to give it a try again so I went and got some stracciatela as that was delicious when I had it before. It was very obvious they were almost our and just scraped/ dumped the last of that container into the bowl. It did not have the freshest taste and it was not the usual consistency and full of water. Bartender was phenomenal however!   I would have formerly given 5+ stars to this place for the ambiance, food, and service, but it seems those in charge no longer share the passion for food the former management did.",

    "text": "Last time I ate at St. Francis I ordered a salad that had colorless lettuce, croutons, and a little parmesan cheese...would that be a Cesar salad maybe? It was $11.00. If I had wanted chicken, that would have been 4-5 dollars more. Dressing was boring. I make great green salads at home for very little money. Why would I want to eat a mediocre one for $16? Why is it that if you want to try and eat healthier, it costs so much more and usually ends up thrown together as a boring after thought on the menu? Value alarm went off!",

Salad was over priced ($19) for what we got, nothing really impressive in the ingredients either. Meatballs were excellent however, I wouldn't recommend it if you are not a meat lover though (there's LOT of meat). The sweet potato...you get one potato! I think it was $7. They just baked it and added some seasoning. The flatbread wasn't very flat. It was very doughy and not impressive. I think Trader Joe's frozen pizza is way better. Overall, very expensive lunch for mediocre food.",

    "text": "i had been wanting to come to the St. Francis for a while. When i walked in, i wasn't even acknowledged. I waited with friends for like five minute before, \"have you been helped?\" was asked from afar. The host said to give him 3 minutes and they would have a table set up. We were sat, and given menus.   As we were sitting the table next to us was sending their food back as everything was cold. Ten minutes later the waiter came back and dropped off some glasses of water, and then didn't even look at us before walking away. Another 10 minutes passed and he came back and said Hi and then offered us drinks. My almond margarita tasted like a plain margarita. The blue corn tortilla quesadilla was really good, and i recommend that. ONLY that.   Our waiter forgot about us. He came back and took our food order and then left, and we didn't see him for a while. He surfaced at our table to give us water, and then left again. Other tables that arrived after we did, were served a lot faster.   When we got our food. I ordered the Chile Burger, and boy I was disappointed. it was cooked correctly, but there was no flavor. I ended up adding salt, pepper, and some of the sauce from the quesadilla to at least make it edible. Our waiter didn't come back to ask how everything was tasting.   The waiter showed up, and asked if we wanted dessert, but honestly after waiting for so long I ended up opting out of dessert and calling it a night.   I have heard so many good things about the food here but honestly, i would go somewhere else for dinner. The food was bad, and the service was terrible.",

Looking like a Dwell Magazine sustainable design structure on the outside,  St Francis has an open flow,  outdoor terrace dining,  outdoor bar,  large open windows connecting the interior and exterior spaces.   Serving farm to table comfort food,  the kitchen is open. Our table had a view of bandanbed, bearded, tattooed chefs doing their thing,  and they did it well.    Shaved Brussel sprouts and cauliflower salad with pomegranates almonds fried capers etc was excellent. The Moroccan meatballs in Moroccan spiced tomato sauce with pearl couscous,  slow cooked pot roast, fire roasted  peppers, all were delicious.    Their infused vodka drinks were strong and excellent.   Our servers could not have been more enthusiastic and charming.  We got the whole \" what farm the meat and vegetables came from\" schtick, kind of like that Portlandia Chicken episode, which was cool, but we didn't get a bio or go to the farm to check out our meals parents :-D  Good place,  good folks,  nice change of pace.",

Upon entering there was an inviting feel and I was quickly greeted by the smiling hostess. She promptly sat me at one of the very few open tables - and I thought, this is a great sign being that it was 1pm on a Tuesday, but that's where the service started going awry.   Immediately after sitting down a waiter popped up behind me and yelled \"hi\". He asked what I wanted to order, but I had literally just been seated and hadn't even picked up the menu - so I asked for a minute.... though, 15 minutes later he still hadn't returned. I finally had to flag him down (which I haaaaaaaaate doing) and asked to place some orders while waiting for my sister.   I started with a dark and stormy, I love my cocktails and it was refreshing. For an appetizer I ordered the baked goat cheese. When the appetizer was brought over, it was a different waitress and she rushed by, slammed the plate down, and ran off. It was almost like she was upset at the table - I couldn't imagine what it had done to offend her, but I figured, maybe she's in a hurry and after tasting the food, I was happy. It was very good. The bread was nice and crunchy and the prominent flavor of the goat cheese was balanced out by the tomato sauce at the bottom of the dish.   Next, the entree's - My sister's plate was SLAMMED down first... she just looked at me in a confused way... then another waitress brought my dish and just plopped it down on top of the small appetizer plate and silverware in front of me... I tried to move the stuff out of the way, but before I could she quickly ran off again. Okay, what in the world is happening? We were both a little confused by the abruptness of the servers. Its like they just grabbed these people off the street and gave them an apron. At least the taste of our food was better than the service.   My sister tried the garden, the chicken and the egg (why such a long name for what is basically a salad, I don't know). She said it was very good, nice and refreshing. I tried the french onion burger, it was good and had french onion dip dripping off it, can't complain about that.   Overall, I give it 3 stars because the place had pretty good food and a great vibe (4 stars), but the service left something to be desired (2 stars). I would go back, but I am not in a hurry.",

The chicken salad sandwich is good, but I'm not sure if it's worth getting again. The other menu items are so good and promising that i think the chicken salad sandwich is a little too boring in comparison.

    "text": "Looks like it's been about a year and a half since I did my St. Francis review. Good timing - as I was asked to suggest dinner ideas for my cousins visiting from New York. And ideas for Sunday brunch with a dear friend and her daughter. So happy we decided to come here! (Yes - two visits in one weekend - score for me!)  For dinner - we arrived close to 6:30, a party of 4 with no reservations. No problem - we were seated in under 20 minutes (we got lucky!) We ordered way too much food - the four of us shared 2 apps, 3 salads and 2 entrees - as well as a few cocktails. It was all SO GOOD! Our server Barry was perfectly on point through the night - my NYC cousins were sufficiently impressed - and St. Francis retains its placement as one of my favorite Valley restaurants.   Fingerling potatoes, baked goat cheese, romaine hearts, kale ceasar, beets, roasted salmon superfood and the special that night of half a roasted chicken. All prepared and plated beautifully. None of us had room for dessert - so that will be a goal for next time!  For brunch Sunday - we arrived at 10:15 - I had made reservations and we were seated immediately. Cocktails and coffee for the grownups, mocktail for the daughter. We shared a baker's board and ordered the kid's pancake, smoked salmon flatbread and tomato baked eggs. There was no room for dessert - but with the lemon and pear muffin, carrot cake and cinnamon roll from the baker's board - we didn't really need it.  Once again - and proving the consistency in service and food from my first review - St. Francis does it right! So happy to have it nearby - and need to keep it on my heavy rotation list!",

    "text": "Beyond the valets, who were quite efficient, we had a truly underwhelming experience at the St. Francis and would never return.     Hosting - 0 stars Incompetent and argumentative... They told us on the phone there was no wait and we should hurry over.  Arrived in less than 10 minutes and told it was now a 35-minute wait (even though 1/3 of the place was empty) and we better plan on getting drinks in the bar, .  We protested and they argued back that we took too long to arrive.  We showed them our cell phone and yes, it was 7 minutes since we had spoken.  They rolled their eyes and grudgingly gave us the huge bar table that was far too large for just the four of us.  Should have just walked out right then.  Seating - 0 stars Very dark with no lighting, no menu, and no server.  Waited for a while in site of the host.  Finally, went over to ask her for a couple of menus.  It was so dark, had to use our cell phones to read the menu.  After a squinting at them for a while, still no water & no server.  We're about to flee this \"Bermuda Triangle\" experience, but the server finally shows up and apologizes profusely that this is not normally his section.  OK - let's start again...  Unfortunately, it did not improve much.  Service - 2 stars Pleasant & helpful, but we were repeatedly forgotten.  Our shared appetizer didn't show until the main courses arrived.  Refills of water were slow and offers to refresh hour drinks didn't occur until we were nearly finished eating.  Took ages to get the bill paid now that the place (about 90 minutes later) had finally filled up.  Food - varied * Roasted Salmon \"superfood\" - 4 stars ($23) quinoa, avocado, soy beans, radish, sweet chile vinaigrette were a good combination of flavors.  We enjoyed that dish.  * Flatbread (which was like fluffy Boboli bread) - 2 stars ($13+ each) - Roasted vegetable version was severely lacking the vegetable toppings - Sausage version was heavy & greasy, and flatbread fell apart  * Meatballs - 1 star ($15) Three dry, overcooked & overly spicy meatballs (and I normally like spice) Had heartburn all night  ;-( Plus the garlic bread served with it was so hard, it was uneatable.    We will not return.",

    "text": "Popped in here looking for a place to eat after checking it out on Yelp.  I had the cheese flatbread, which I found to be so-so.  I also had to try the fingerling potatoes. YUM YUM.  The outside was nice and crispy.  Two of us split the small order, which was plenty for us.  She had the eggplant parmesan.  Definitely a different take than the standard Italian where it is soggy and swimming in sauce.  This eggplant was very tasty and had some body to it.  Small dinner salad was also a nice addition.  The service was EXCEPTIONAL.  We came at an off time, so could see that this place could get packed quickly.  Quirky table set-ups inside and out...",

    "text": "Went here for one of my best friend's birthdays. We had a large group so you know things are usually altered when you're traveling in a pack of 12. We were seated in a cool area that had part of the booth extend out into a bay type window area. It was a really cool effect and would be really nice if it was rainy but as it was, it was a nice touch. We order our drinks, that didn't take too long. My boyfriend attempted to order a Heineken, then a Fosters, then a Corona, but they didn't have any of those options... He finally settled on a Stella which he was happy with, but I thought it odd that they didn't have any of those other options.   We moved on to the menu, which if you're a vegetarian, go else where. I was a vegetarian for a time and I really didn't see a lot of options outside of the salads. Not only that but it seemed like meat was infused into everything. I swear, not joking, pork was in every other item on the menu. If you like pork, that's great, but if you don't eat it, or can't eat it you were kinda $hit outta luck. Even dishes like fish had some kinda of pork in it... kinda weird. Oh yeah, and PIG DIP, is not an attractive name... I finally settled on the pot roast and got an appetizer of the goat cheese.   Meanwhile our drinks took literally around 20 minutes to get. This might be ok, except they weren't that busy... I got a standard margarita which was average at best.   We eventually got our goat cheese app but my friend had to re-request the bread that he had ordered for everyone. The goat cheese was really great, I'm not sure I've had melted goat cheese before but it was definitely a good choice and probably the best part of the meal and evening.   Eventually our food did come, it definitely took a while. The waitress left plenty of empy water and drink classes sit for a long time. I'm not sure if it was because we were tucked away in the corner or what... oh that and no matter what she's gonna get 18% gratuity. It took a while, and we actually had to try and flag her down so we could order another round of drinks and get some more water... But anyways back to the food. My pot roast was good, but definitely not amazing. i think I'll probably stick to eating my mothers for how much it cost. But to be fair I feel like most other people were happy with their food, and its not that I wasn't, but this place is pretty expensive and the service had been crap at that point.   We got our checks and attempted to pay, but they gave us our bills without gratuity, so after we gave our money, she they returned to give it back so we could pay gratuity that she had forgot to add on (they were very good about splitting up the check though, which is always appreciated). After gratuity it was a hefty bill for two people. We then re put our money in and 15 minutes were ready to leave. She never came back with our change (and I wasn't leaving her a 30 dollar tip for that service) so I went back in to find out what happened and she had actually never even taken our bill again. So when she finally came back to get it, what should have been 11 dollars and change, she just handed me two 5 dollar bills..... I don't even know what to say about that.   All in all, the food was fine, it wasn't great it wasn't horrible. The ambiance was nice, visually I enjoyed the venue, but service wise I was super freaking disappointed. I'm not crazy about having amazing service, but that was just horrible and if you're not busy, there's no excuse. ESPECIALLY when a group of 12 people is then paying gratuity. LAME and I don't know that I'll go back.",

    "text": "Definitely not my favorite! I went here after seeing it on TV the night before. So excited to get the pig sandwich. I got there around brunch time so I had alittle wait. 45 minutes...cool...no problem. I sat at the bar and had three drinks while I waited (don't judge me. I was thirsty.) The bartenders were cool ,very trendy and friendly. My bill came to $30. Paid & went to my table, all excited about the pig. To my dismay, I couldn't order the pig because it wasn't lunch time, they didn't have all the ingredients AND if I wanted it, I would have to wait another 45 minutes until the shipment of supplies came in. Not a good first impression. Still excited to give this place a try, I order the American Breakfast. Definitely something I can cook at home (see pic). I was not a fan. During my brunch, the bartender thought I hadn't paid my bar tab. Luckily I kept my receipt (let this be a lesson to you kids. Keep your receipt). He resolved the issue, I paid for my brunch & left. A few days later, I was checking my account and noticed two charges. Sounds good...right? One for the bar & one for brunch. Fooled you didn't I? Must have fooled them too. A different card was used for lunch. The bar charged me twice. Yup...you read that right. TWICE! They get three stars because Shelby (manager) took care of the issue within minutes with a giftcard for the second charge. IDK if that's good or not considering I wasn't planning to go back AND they get to keep my money. I went for the quickest option because Shelby said it would take two weeks to get my money back. Why? It didn't take two weeks to come out the account. My gift card is in the safe with name on it but I'm not in a rush to pick it up. I'll give you three guess why...",

The design of this restaurant is really very beautiful, and the outside area is absolutely lovely.    Our waitresses seems to have a little argument about who our table belonged to which gave me an uncomfortable feeling.   We got the pumpkin soup and the goat cheese appetizer.  The pumpkin soup was good, too sweet for my taste, which we fixed by adding lots of black pepper.  The herbed goat cheese though, wasn't quite what I expected.  I love baked herbbed goat cheeses, and this one was cooked so long until it was almost completely liquid, and served with lots of tomatoes.  So it's more of a baked tomato goat cheese than herbs.  It was still pretty good, I was just craving one of my favorite preparations of goat cheese which this one failed to satisfy.",

We both had a cup of the pumpkin soup which was delicious, then my husband had a burger and a beer, I had the forbidden rice bowl.  I've always enjoyed the rice bowl but this time it was terrible.  The vegetables were barely cooked, the chicken was old and tasteless, there was no ginger, It was a bland dish.  The good news was the wine.  Next time we want to drop 80.00 for lunch it won't be at St. Francis.   Such a disappointment!",

    "text": "Saint Francis of Assisi may be the patron saint of animals and the environment but after a recent visit, I wonder if St Francis neighborhood restaurant in Central Phoenix can live up to it's namesake.  I'd heard several things about this little restaurant near Camelback road and Central in Phoenix via both Facebook and Twitter, mostly from people who seem to know a thing or two about a good meal. After having stopped in on several occasions I'm ready to share my thoughts.  The restaurant is larger than it appears from the outside, in fact, you can (and I have on many occasions) drive right past with nary a glance. The parking is terrible but once inside things begin to come together. The decor is modern, funky and comfortable, the staff accommodating, and the menu enticing.  As I'm a True fan of a good burger (something so simple yet often executed so poorly), I was drawn to the French onion burger with it's promise of applewood smoked bacon, gruyere cheese and crispy onions ($13).  I've had quite a few \"gourmet\" burgers in my time and have sadly discovered the only thing gourmet about many of them is the price tag. Having said this, I was a little dubious about what would arrive.  My (notably) pleasant server arrived with my meal in short order and I was quite pleased with both it's presentation and size, not obnoxiously large but certainly enough to justify the price if that were the only criteria.  On first bite I knew something was different about this burger, it was perfectly cooked mid-rare, juicy, and the thick, crunchy bacon played well with sweet, slightly salty gruyere cheese. Crispy onions seemed a great addition and added texture and flavor while the bun, and this is important, didn't go all soggy and fall apart.  Flanked by some of the tastiest French fries I've had in a while, I'd have to give this burger high marks for concept (simple but well executed), texture (not the typical dry OR mushy patty passed off as gourmet), and taste (in this case, exactly what I'm looking for in a burger).  If you find yourself in need of sustenance on the long road to wherever it is you happen to be heading, make a point of stopping in and partaking in the food and hospitality of St. Francis.",

    "text": "I have really tried to love St. Francis, but the restaurant just isn't working for me. I've been back a few times, and I have the same mediocre experience each time. Nothing is ever BAD; it's just average.  The food is the one redeeming quality of St. Francis, because for the most part, everything is really good. I say this based on my friends' opinions because I'm never completely satisfied with what I order. The most recent time that I went to St. Francis, I had the french onion burger, and it was lacking a defining flavor. Something sharp to offset everything else. It was, dare I say it . . . plain. Broadly speaking, the bread is good, the seasonal soup is good, the flatbreads are also (you guessed it) good. I just haven't been given a blown-away food experience.  I get a little agitated with the seating. I know that St. Francis takes reservations, but it is upsetting when, as a walk-in, you wait for 30+ minutes while many empty tables go unseated during that time. Not just one or two; we're talking five, six, even eight empty tables at one point. I haven't been a hostess for a long time, so I hate mentioning it because I probably wouldn't understand the workings of seating arrangements at a fine dining restaurant, but it's one of the things that always happens when I go to St. Francis. My friends and I wait while many tables remain empty.   I know that I am outside of the statistical norm with my rating, but I can't bring myself to give any additional stars. And to be honest, I'm not sure if I'm willing to spend any more money to try to give St. Francis the opportunity to earn any additional credit.",

Water was never empty and beer for me and drinks for Mrs were definitely attended to.  Food:  Seriously so so.  Wife had pig dip, which I had a bite of and it was good, but not worth a 30 minute drive.  I had the chile verde with sunny eggs.  This was the definition of \"meh\".  I can't say it was bad, because to say it was bad would mean it had flavor that didn't appeal to me.  To me, it just didn't have any flavor at all.  Sunny eggs and a roasted jalapeno should make a catcher's mitt taste good, but to me nothing worked.  Other people might think differently, that's just my opinion.  Happy Hour:  Really good.  Mrs. had a $5 cocktail and I had (2) $3 draft beers, one from Four Peaks, the other from Sleepy Dog.  We got the fingerling potatoes for an appetizer, those were great.  All in all, if you're here for happy hour, it's a great place.  I, however am rating on a dinner experience, and the entrees just didn't deliver near enough.    It can pass for decent if you live close, but if not, I wouldn't make the drive.",

But its well worth it and besides you can get the evening started out right with a glass of wine from the bar.    I love the intimate yet sleek atmosphere.  There is exposed brick walls and beams on the ceiling, vintage yet modern interior... great lighting and little candles everywhere.  The exterior is just as inviting!   We opted for the chicken flatbread and pork chile verde...both of which were really excellent and fairly inexpensive for the quality and vibe of the restaurant.  I think this is one of my favorite things about St. Francis... you feel like you should be paying more than $10-15 for a meal... but then the bill comes and you are pleasantly surprised!    So guys.... remember St. Francis when you are choosing a date locale... its super cute, looks to be on the fancier side, but won't break the bank!",

First of all, our server ranted and raved about the cioppino.  When she said she got to enjoy one after \"winning a contest\" at which point I should have know she was more of a saleswoman than a True guide of the menu.  She ranted and raved about the cheesy bread included in the dish, not exactly a traditional staple of cioppino but I thought I'd give it a try.  It tasted like delicious cheese bread in the middle of Ragu and old seafood.  Good cioppino is rare, but it's not rocket science.  This was easily the worst dish St. Francis has done in my experience and for the price and reputation they try to uphold, this is inexcusable.    Happy hour at St. Francis?  Good.  Pizza?  They use the crust from LGO so it better be decent.  It's a good thing St. Francis has a good location, beautiful building, hipster popularity and great happy hour...  General Phoenix diners will be able to look past the low quality food for those reasons.  True quality food-seekers will look elsewhere.  I'll give you a try again in a few months St. Francis, I hope you can hold on to a few decent cooks and a chef long enough to make some changes.",

    "text": "St. Francis is stellar in my book and I think I'll be tempted to give it five stars next time. Looking for a cool, urban, unpretentious place to eat? Then you've found it!   My friend and I went on a Saturday night. Without a reservation, they were able to seat us immediately. This may even have been too fast, as I didn't have an opportunity to have my pre-dinner drink and I'm not one to drink during dinner. While I've read the patio is the place to be, there were no tables (not just \"not available\" but literally no tables!) which may have been a good thing. With temps hovering around 100 degrees at 8:00pm, the comfort of A/C has it's advantages!   The staff, everyone from the valet to the seating hostess to the server, were on their toes. All were attentive and friendly ... the type of service where you know the tip you gave was well earned.   My friend had the Pot Roast; probably a dish better suited for cooler temps, but delicious and satisfying, nonetheless.  He tells me his wine was also good.  (I'm not much of a wine person, so I can't comment confidently on that.)   I opted for the more season-friendly cool Chicken Salad Sandwich. It was a wonderful combination of flavors. My only concern was that the sandwich began to fall apart, making it difficult to eat neatly in public. It came with a choice of sides and I elected the sweet corn polenta. Oh Em Gee!!! If I didn't know it was polenta, I would've sworn it was Mom's whipped potatoes. Soooo creamy and yummy! And a steal as a standalone for just $3!   St. Francis's ambiance is great for both day or night and seems like the kind of place I'd like to revisit time and time again for anything from brunch to dinner. As the Governator once said, \"I'll be back!\" :D",

    "text": "Went to St Francis on 7/15 (with a reservation). There was no hostess for 2-3 minutes, so we just waited around the hostess stand. Table was ready and we were seated within a few minutes.  When we were seated server introduced another server. She was fairly absent for much of the dinner.  A few key items: Parking: \"complimentary\" valet? Really? One knows it is not complimentary. I can park my own car, thanks (and I did - in another lot) Delays and wait times: Took 10 minutes before drink orders were taken, even longer to replenish (I waited 15 min for a 2nd beverage - A simple draft beer). Other members in the party waited for drinks on other occasions as well. Food: Loooong delay (45+ min) with getting food delivered, no bread etc was offered until we asked, and then food magically appeared 2 min later. A simple excuse of \"a private event was taking up the kitchen\" was the only reason given. Really? Private event (presumably per-arranged/scheduled) and you don't schedule enough staff for it? Food was OK, not as amazing as I had expected. My burger wasn't cooked as requested, but I did not want to wait another hour for food. People in our party asked for various additional items, and there was a delay with most of them, or server had forgotten that we had asked, so we had to ask a 2nd time.  I almost went back to ask to speak to a manager, but by the time we were leaving - it was so late that I was ready to head out, and not spend any longer (waiting) at the restaurant. But I'd suggest someone takes a look at scheduling and kitchen.  Would I go back? Maybe, once they fix wait times and kitchen issues. Atmosphere was neat - only reason why I give it 2 stars. I hope others have a better experience.",

    "text": "My favorite thing about this place is how it looks on the inside.  Very cool with the red brick.  The only thing I didn't care for was the halogen lights  on the wires.  They remind me of the mall.  I know, picky. I think they were trying to be too cool with the bathrooms.   The \"sink\" looked like a copper plated shelf that was corroding.  The safe was pretty neat though.   We first got to the restaurant for Sunday brunch they had a band playing. They were playing very loud it was very distracting. I couldn't even hear my wife talking to me sitting across from me. She agreed that the band was playing too loud it was annoying to her as well. Luckily they stop playing soon after we arrived and it was a much it was a much more relaxing experience.  Had they kept singing I would have given the place a 3 overall and would probably not be planning on going back.   I am not a fan of brunch.  we got there after 1pm.  I had already had breakfast earlier.  I would of liked to have seen more dinner type entrees.  I will likely be back, but not for brunch!  Now on to the food. If you are addicted to carbs you will love this place.  The bread and other backed goodies looks great.  The bake them in a wood oven.  I did not try any of the bread, but was tempted.   I had a chili verde and my wife had the salmon salad. They must have left it sitting under the broiler a little too long. Some of the top layer pieces of pork were little dried out stringy. Underneath the pieces were very tender and was tender as well. I have to say though I like the chili verde at Z'Tejas better and it's cheaper there as well. My wife said that they changed the salmon salad from he last time she ate there. They got rid of the lettuce!  The salmon was perfectly cooked but it was sitting on a bed of  cold quinoa.   Only the first few bites of salmon were warm, then it got cold.  I think it would be better if the quinoa would have been hot.  My wife liked the version with the salad much better.",

My friend Xurri R. was there with me and her review goes into much more detail. We waited very long for drinks and refills, never got any check ins. Had to ask for things and they weren't that busy.   It's pretty pricey. For 2 burgers, 1 cocktail, and 1 beer it was just shy of $50 before tip.   Also, they served our cake that we brought, but I had number candles which had been taped to the cake and they freaking lost one. My friend was turning 20-something and they lost the 2! WTH?",

    "text": "Two words. Pig Dip. Two more words. Order it  My wife andI went on a date night and on the lightrail, I did a search and found out how close St . Francis is.  Greeted by a hostess, we were painfully early for our reservation and they were slammed. We weren't in any hurry so we took a couple of chairs at the bar. They have Flagstaff Brewing Co. Red!    We previewed the menu and asked some questions. Then, we got to sit down upstairs (after a second Red). We ordered starters, a s roasted squash with honey, jalepeno, almonds and goat cheese. We ordered the corn soup.  Both...delicious.  We waited a bit long for our appetizers to come, but it gave us a chance to catch up after a long week. The only issue, almost predictably, our entrees came and we had to rush through finishing our starters. The corn soup has a nice hint of spice withe roasty corn sweetness. It was a little under seasoned in the salt department, but a small pinch took care of it. The roasted squash was the star here.  My wife chose the pork chile verde and I did the dip with fries and what tasted like a homemade chipotle ketchup.  The pig dip is perfect. On pickle would have been a nice add, but...that's nitpicking. It's the best pulled pork and cheese with pork broth on great crusty bread goodness a man with a waisteline should have.  Oh so, piggly wiggly good!  The fries were homemade and the ketchup was excellent. My second red ale washed my palate. The pork chile verde was delicious as well (we swapped bites). My spouse and I cleaned plates and then shared the date bread pudding with the vanilla gelato and caramel sauce. Make sure they have fresh coffee brewed before you order dessert because we couldn't stop eating it and it was gone before the coffee got back to the table.  Thanks St. Francis for a lightrail treat on Camelback Rd.",

It arrived a little blackened and it was adorned with lemon aioli, Parmesan cheese and croutons. Wow! Good stuff. The skillet pancake came next. It was charred from the skillet and the wood oven in which it was baked. Add to that the chocolate chip filling, the carmelized apples on top and the whipped cream and you've got a hit! Yes, we are two-for-two. The third item was the pig dip sandwich, a combination of pork butt, bacon, and onion fennel marmalade on a French roll. Every dip into the au jus was a piece of heaven. Three-for-three! Good work, St. Francis. Good work!",

I had the French Onion Burger and was disappointed. Meat was undercooked for medium rare [and were I not a fan of 'rare' in its Truest sense [rather than the current 'omg it causes food borne illness - lets get rid of all color in the burger' rare...] I would have sent it back. The meat is juicy but not seasoned enough [hardly] for my taste. The onions were not 'crispy onions' just barely cooked, bare-naked onion, the bacon/gruyere combo was deevine [I ate it sans the other half of my burger] as was the light brioche bun. I was starving and the side salad was a delicious combination of greens and veggies perfectly dressed but overall I wasn't impressed, especially when the bill came. $17 for a burger and an iced tea.   Seems hit or miss and I think we had a bit of both.",

Food is still good but drinks stay low to the point of irritation. On our last visit, yesterday, my coffee came out with lipstick on the cup. I requested a new cup when our server took our orders but didn't see the new cup until 15 minutes later -- and I had it finished before our meals came. Also, Jenny ordered an english muffin that did not come out with her plate but were assured it was coming. Since no one came to check on us until we were almost done (which is when I requested my coffee refill), she just waved it off. Our server did seem apologetic about the issue and, since someone else was delivering the food, it's understandable that he was disappointed. Still though, St Francis, get everyone on the same page. YOU USED TO BE SUCH A GREAT PLACE!",

I've tried other items on the menu, which were all good but I always go back to the salmon. The rice bowl is a close second though. We've been there when it was a little slower but most of the time it's a very busy place. We've never waited more then 30 minutes for our table which is really good for such a high volume, happening restaurant. If you want to avoid a wait, I'd suggest making a reservation or going during lunch. We normally get sat right away when we follow those two simple rules. If we're really hungry we'll get the melted goat cheese app. Its served with really crispy bread. My mom has sensitive gums/teeth so we just asked for a side of softer bread and they were more then happy to bring that over for us. Just expect for the bread that comes with it to be pretty crunchy.   I love St. Francis, can't think of a bad thing to say about it!",

My friends and I had just so-so service when eating brunch here.    The lunch/happy hour are pretty good.  I love the white loaves of bread, and they are only $3 to purchase for a to-go item.   The Happy Hour pricing is OK, but not fantastic.   I enjoyed the bread/ goat cheese with pesto. It was delicious, and it was very filling.  The side of vegetables was just meh. It included green beans, carrots, old broccoli, and some others. The veggies were bland and boring.    Parking can be a pain. There is only valet parking during certain hours, and the lot is teeny tiny.  We parked at Auto Zone one time (not sure if that's allowed, but whatever). The valet parker told us to park behind a bank. I don't know what he meant.   The ambiance is loud/crowded. I felt cramped at my recent dinner, and the people next to me were maybe six inches away from our table. I could hear every word of the conversation. I was bumped at least three times, and my date had butts in his face multiple times from wait staff turning around right near us.   If there was more space / less claustrophobia, I'd be back!",

Easily shared between two people. Ask for the lemon aioli to dip your fries in! So good!!! Their crispy fingerling potatoes and also crave worthy. They are nice and crispy and salty with fried sage on top and lemon aioli to dip in. The eggs Benedict we had today was also really yummy. They were a little pricey though at 15 dollars. Their coffee is cartel coffee, which is delicious. Parking can be tricky, but not usually a problem.",

I got the pig sandwich that's was featured on the show and I was basically in heaven!  The sandwich is HUGE and I brought half of it home and split it with the bf for lunch the next day. It heated up perfectly in the toaster oven the next day. He got the French onion burger and it was cooked spot on and tasted delicious, he had no leftovers. We both got fries with our meals and I don't eat ketchup so got a side of the red sauce and I literally wanted to eat it like a soup!    We were both stuffed but I wanted dessert so we got the chocolate trifle with caramel corn to go and we're not disappointed a few hours later when we ate it.",

Starting with the crispy fingerling potatoes, they were extremely tasty but just wish there was a little more crisp for me personally. The season was perfect. We also started with the wood roasted broccoli, which was amazing. The sauce that the chef pairs with this simple vegetable is delicious. It is a lighter sauce, with I think a tint of lemon... I highly recommend this one. Lastly, we shared a Pig Dip. That's right, a Pig Dip. One, this sandwich was heavy! I picked a half up and couldn't believe it! Second, the taste and caramelized onions were a hit on the sandwich. Our server was also very helpful and knowledgeable, which was nice for us.",

We couldn't wait to leave which worked as they rushed our meal by bringing dinner before they had cleared the appetizer. We were in and out in about 35 minutes.

Folks, if you want to pay 15$ for a Burger King quality burger then this is the burger for you. Service: The service was about average. Our waiter was nice and smiley but neglected the table quite often to the point that I thought we had ceased to exist. The sodium special fries had my mouth frothing at the mouth for water to quench the dry oasis of a desert that had formed.  Atmosphere: It's hip and the music is some kinda house music that's kinda jazzy. I don't even know. Must be some millennial music idk.  Overall: A nice-looking area to eat but in all honest my surroundings felt cell-like and my fellow table mates had to be hunched over like rabid dogs feasting on bones because of the IKEA quality seating arrangement.",

We also had the seasonal salad which didn't totally get my boyfriend on board with beets but did at least give him reason to try them!  Mixed with fresh citrus it was so refreshing.   Last we shared the Mongolian meatballs which had such a unique taste we had to ask what they seasoned it with. Sure enough all the usual meatball culprits were there for seasoning with a special appearance by cinnamon!  They were awesome.

If you like grapefruit, this drink also has a hint of it, but isn't so overpowering, since it is mellowed out by the basil. I highly recommend trying this drink. They also have good deals during happy hour. I have only eaten lunch here and got the french onion dip burger. It was probably the best burger I have ever had.

We got there around 10 am before the music started, which was a good idea cause it crowded around 11. The menu was certainly \"hip\", but not too many options.  We ordered the Tomato-baked eggs and the chocolate pancake. Both were very good, however... DO NOT CALL IT \"MAPLE SYRUP\" ON THE MENU WHEN IT CLEARLY WAS NOT! I'm from New England and when you say maple syrup, it better be REAL maple syrup... not \"Log Cabin\" crap (I asked the waitress and she told me it was that). I know this is Arizona and maybe people don't notice the difference (or frankly care), but as someone who grew up around legit, authentic maple syrup, I'm very passionate about this subject (clearly). That's like serving American cheese and calling it \"artisan cheese.\"  NOT THE SAME! Just put \"syrup\" on the menu - not \"'maple syrup.\" The pancake was delicious however, even with the crap, store-brand syrup.  At the end of our meal, we got a mimosa and a Bellini to enjoy the music a little longer. While they were slightly overpriced, they were a good way to end our meal.",

Our server came by and got our drink order and offered to get us a Iron Skillet Pancake to start while we looked over the menu. I ended up ordering the Chicken Salad Sandwich with French fries for my meal and my husband got the Tomato Baked Eggs.  The Iron Skillet Pancake came out first and was actually quite filling. It was tasty with the apples & maple syrup. I'm not sure if this is one of the options I'd order on my own (since a few other baked items also looked really good) but as mentioned, it did taste good! The Chicken Salad Sandwich they offer was much different than I've had at other restaurants while I liked. It didn't have the traditional mayonnaise-base but rather was tossed in a lemon vinaigrette. It was a nice lighter option. My husband really enjoyed the Tomato Baked Eggs, he said this dish was one of the best brunch dishes he has had at a restaurant. The presentation itself was very nice, in a small skillet with the tomato sauce, potatoes, eggs, and spices along with a piece of toast.  Overall, we were intrigued by their menu items as they seemed a bit more unique. We are planning on returning to try their dinner as well. Only thing to note is the service is good but a bit slow so I'd give myself some extra time to dine here but would absolutely recommend this restaurant!",

    "text": "Gentrification. Hip. Advertise on Yelp. Cool Kids.  To be considered one of the \"cool kids\" on Phoenix Yelp, have all of the above and don't forget to be in Central Phoenix and/or Roosevelt Row.  Well, owner/chef Aaron Chamberlin covered all his bases: He's got St. Francis, which is in a remodeled historic building on Camelback Road, just east of Central, in uptown Phoenix, Arizona; Two locations of Public Market Cafe, and Taco Chelo, on Roosevelt Row.   BOOM! The Cool Kid Trifecta!  Of no surprise at all, Aaron was an original collaborator in La Grande Orange (LGO) hospitality group, which includes La Grande Orange Pizzeria, Chelsea's Kitchen, and Buck & Rider; all of which go heavy and hard on Yelp, so don't be surprised to see all of their projects promoted heavily and in almost all Yelp Elite timelines.  But is there anything of substance behind all the hoop-la? Yes.  Using his life-long experience, Aaron set out to create his own unique establishment, and St. Francis is that realization of his dream, which he runs with his spouse, Lee del Real, and brother, David Chamberlin.  St. Francis' motto is that the best ingredients yield the best dishes, and that the less food travels, the fresher it tastes; therefore they strive to obtain as many ingredients from local sources as possible.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  Firstly, parking. St. Francis mimics Chelsea's Kitchen and Buck & Rider model of mostly-mandatory valet parking. It's not an area conducive to many parking options, so it's basically the only option.  Once there, it's a pretty hip spot, especially for brunch, so I'm glad we had reservations.  The vibe/decor is the current trend of edgy, raw, exposed architecture. It's cute, and what I'd expect from this crew and location.  The hostess was ADORABLE. In fact, the waitstaff was STUNNING. They all could be super models, instead of working there. They sat me inside, in the far back booth. I think it was the best seat in the house, even though it was right by the bathroom. From that seat, you can see the whole house, and the kitchen too.  I started with mimosas; like all of the mimosas; always a great way to start.  We tried the skillet pancake and the salmon eggs Benedict. I thoroughly enjoyed my skillet pancake, but the eggs in the Benedict were slightly over-cooked, so we had a re-do, which they were happy to oblige.  The crowd was of all ages, which was nice; it's nice to know a brunch place that's not just for retirees, and is cool for all.  CONCLUSION  I loved St. Francis. It was very busy and a great place to spend the morning people watching and chatting, whilst eating some delicious food.  4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Parking is valet.  *Patio seating available.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstfrancisaz.com&s=9bd00342673238c8a10d030c9b5ebbc18922a6dbf86273458b47dfcf9ed2de16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">stfrancisaz.com</a>",

All I eat was the Duck. Would have been 5 starts, BUT it gets 4 because of those green beans. * Roasted Chicken entree - gets stars just for how the dish was plated. The fact that the chicken was so juicy and tender made it even better. 5 Stars  * Baked Rigatoni entree - my colleague said it was good, but a little too chewy. 3.5 Stars * Roasted Salmon Superfood entree - received two thumbs up from my colleague. He said it was the best salmon he'd ever had. 5 Stars   Desserts We got all 4 desserts (Sticky Toffee Pudding, Butter Cake, Summer Corn Blueberry Trifle and Chocolate Cake) were all 5 Stars, but that Chocolate Cake was so good I wanted to lick the plate. If you only want one dessert the Chocolate Cake won't disappoint.",

Hands down: the cauliflower steak is one of the most unexpected and delicious things I've had in a while. The sauce is something of dreams and I dearly miss this dish just writing this review!!  Only knocking off a star because it rained for all of 1 minute so they cancelled all reservations to bring people inside. Sensible right? NO. If you cancel people's reservations, at least send a message on OpenTable so I don't show up to a 40 minute wait. FORTY MINUTES.",

(The second round wasn't as good but that isn't enough to drop a star). Then our Entree, my husband had the salmon and I had beef tenderloin. We both enjoyed every bite. Finished off with dessert of pizookie. It was absolutely delicious. Personal preference would be more ice cream on top but that's just me! 10-10 would recommend for a nice quiet date night or a small group of friends. It was a bit cold out side for us or else we would wanted to sit on their beautiful patio.",

They sat us right next to their computers where they type in our orders.  I didn't care for that too much.  I ordered the Salmon Flatbread which was good but was not more than pizza bread w/a thin slice of salmon on it.  Also, I ordered their pear salad.  Now the salad would've been delicious but the dressing was very tart.  Don't know what went wrong there.  I told the waitress though.  Everyone else in my group was happy with their meals.  Some group members ordered the Chile Verde which comes w/corn bread.  Now, I tasted this and it was very good.  From the looks of how much the group ate the food, I took to mean they liked their food.  We also ordered 2 bottles of the Melbec (Mendoza Argentina) and was very deliciously served at the right temperature which I love.  They have a nice entrance way from the back which was very handy since we parked in the back.  I'll definitely will give this restaurant another chance once I order another dish.  But, just want to say it's worth it to give this restaurant a try if anyone is thinking about it.  I gave 3 stars because my group really enjoyed their meals.  I liked our waitress who was this thin, short-haired blond.  She reminded me of the singer Pink.  She was very delightful.",

As others have stated, this place is NOISY!  There are a lot of hard surfaces (cement floors, etc.) that cause the conversations and laughter to rebound off every surface and reverberate.  It gets so loud at times you can't hear to have a conversation.  The waitress took a bit to come see us but, when she did, we definitely had her full attention.  She was friendly, well informed and more than happy to answer our questions and give us her thoughts on any dishes.  She knew her menu and gave great descriptions to help you decide.  I ended up ordering the Green Chili and my b/f got the Potroast.  We nibbled on the their housemade bauguette and it wasn't very long until our meals arrived.  One word - DELICIOUS!  OMG was it good.  The pork in my green chili was so tender and had the perfect amount of seasonings/spice.  The 2 slices of cornbread were silky and flavorful.  The portion sizes were perfect.  Not so much that you felt stuffed but you definitely weren't hungry - \"comfortably full\"  The taste of the Potroast that i had was also incredible.  The only mistake we made was ordering the chocolate cake.  The waitress said it was 'semi-sweet' and that should have warned us.  It definitely was missing the sweetness that we enjoy.  That being said, in hindsight, she did a great job of her description of the cake but we misinterpreted it.  On the drive home, we both commented on how fantastic the food was and a total steal for the price.  It is the type of meal that you would pay at least $10 more/plate anywhere else.  The only complain is the noise.  Everything else about this place is stellar.  I think next time we would come later and see if it is a bit quieter.",

    "text": "I was so excited to go to St. Francis for brunch with my friends today.  I've been hearing glowing reviews of this restaurant, and have been eager to try it.  We just beat the Sunday morning rush.  We were a party of 6, and we were seated at the long, uncomfortable table with the bench seats.  The seats were too low to really be easy to slip into and out of, and on one side of the table there were no backs to the seats.  How comfortable can that be?  Anyway, the menu looked delightful, and the Cartel coffee was strong and delicious.  We ordered a couple of their sticky buns to share.  They were huge, and quite yummy.  I ordered the basic American Breakfast (2 eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast).  The only thing I finished was the bacon.  The eggs, while light and fluffy, were bland.  There was neither salt nor pepper on our table, and we weren't offered hot sauce.  The toast was dry.  While the bread was good, could I possibly have some butter, please?  And the jam was overly-sweet and tasted like Smuckers--nothing special.  The potatoes were whole fingerlings, and were so dry I only ate one and left the rest.  Blah.  On the plus side, the male servers were attractive and our all-female party enjoyed that aspect of the experience.  I love what they've done with the building, and I'll give them another chance at lunch or dinner, but I won't be going back to St. Francis for brunch.  We HATED the valet parking.  It was raining outside and we had to wait in line for an unreasonable amout of time for our car.",

    "text": "Again, i wish yelp had half stars. i would give this place 3.5 stars. i am rounding down because, well I thought this place was kind of forgettable. We arrived in time for the Happy Hour specials, so we ordered drinks: I had ths plum flavored cocktail which they no longer have on the drink menu anymore. The menu said it has basil in it but when I ordered it they said that they were out of basil and they were just going out to get more. 25 minutes later I had my drink. The basil made no difference anyway.  The hubby and I were really hungry so we had the baked goat cheese. It was bubbly, tomatoe-y and delicious. That was probably the best thing we ordered. The bad thing was that they didn't give us enough toast to go with it, so we had to ask for more, which made us look like huge fatties. For the main course I had the pork chop. That was probably the worst thing on the menu. It was this huge, thick piece of meat that was nicely seared on the outside. I was excited because i was hoping it would be super-juicy inside. No, they failed. It was tough and dry. I could barely cut through it. It was flavorful though and the polenta that it came with was good. I think they have changed this dish a little since then because I don't remember there being brussel sprouts as in the current menu (I hate those nasty little things). My husband had the seafood soup/stew that's not on the current menu. The broth was a little fishy but the seafood in the soup was cooked well.   I am not sure how the food on the current menu is, but I hope they made some improvements. I really like the atmosphere of the place and would go back to give it a second chance. Maybe we will get to sit upstairs!",

The polenta is so rich and creamy it eats like a meal by itself. The pork chop was perfectly cooked and seasoned about as well as any piece of meat I have ever had. My wife won't stop talking about how much she liked the forbidden rice we had last night.The waitstaff is friendly and the atmosphere is comfortably refined.",

She got the salad that had thinly slice grapefruit and a light but tasty vinaigrette. I choose the lobster bisque. This lobster bisque was so good except one thing, they put thinly sliced pecans in it. This is not a place for nuts. I had a few bites of it before I got the pecans and it was delicious. Once i chewed the nuts it coated my mouth and that was all I could taste for the rest of the bowl. Leave the nuts out next time it was so good!!! Course #2 She got the scallops. Freakin awsome and cooked to perfection! I have never had a scallop cook so perfect ever. Props to who ever was cooking the scallops that night! I ordered the fillet. I ordered it med rare and it was more like med+ and I took one bite and decided to keep it cause it was delicious and they were busy and didn't want to wait 15 min for another. I usually would have sent it back but the flavor was there and the veggies that came with were excellent. For the desserts she got pear dessert with ice cream. Freakin awsome. Great thing to have for cleansing the palate after all that great food. I got the Chocolate turtle dessert that was great but we took that home for later. The building is cool and for the firs timers the waiter gives you a little history about the building before ordering. Great service and great food. We will be back and cant wait to see whats on the menu next time we stop by!",

He made a few mistakes with our orders, but nothing that ruined our meal.  I started with the pork chili....tender with a nice kick.  Next was the steak- great flavor.  I was supposed to have extra potatoes but they sent me extra brocolli...no complaints about that mistake as the meal overall was quite heavy.  All in all a nice evening and tasty meal.",

I don't like to read long stories about restaurants, I just want to know if I should go eat there or not, so here goes:  Hubs ordered the pork chop - it was a big and thick cut, cooked perfectly...the rub was delicious and had a kick to it.  I ordered the pot roast which was good and I was able to pull it apart with my fork. I couldn't finish it!  The polenta underneath the pot roast was so good - as full as I was, I could have continued to keep eating it had there been more on my plate.  We shared the sticky toffee dessert which was really sweet but oh-so-good.    In the end, our bill came close to $100 (including tip)...the food was good...not fantastic, and definitely not worth $100.    The funniest part was when the valet guy decided he wanted to go home, so he came in to the restaurant and went from table to table asking if they did valet, and if they did, he laid out all the car keys and told them to pick their keys because he was going home for the night.",

I've had the omelette for breakfast which was fabulous and I recently went there for lunch and they also had a breakfast sandwich on the menu.  Not your ordinary sandwich for sure and it was so good.   Let me preface by saying that they are part of the slow cooking food movement which means that your food is fresh.  I never liked food from other places being prepped so much that is was rushed out before you even finished your salad or appetizers.  Take your time, have a drink and enjoy the atmosphere.",

The way it was described on the menu, I expected it to be a delicious warm chocolate cake with layers of Carmel and whipped cream with walnuts on top.  Honestly it reminded me of a Hostess Cupcake with Cracker Jacks on top!  This place is a classy restaurant and with a price of $8.50 just for the dessert, I expected a dessert like what you would receive at Ruth Cris or  a similar establishment.  I could not eat it!!

I tried the meatball dish from their happy hour menu.  I think its cumin, but one of the flavors is just overpowering.  The bread it comes with is rock hard, not sure if you're supposed to soak it in something?  It  was a bit overkilled..  The flatbread pizza was good.  The cheesecake in the jar was not very good - more like cheesecake pudding in a jar..  The sticky toffee pudding wasn't bad but could've used something nutty or salty...  something.  Brunch was terrible.  I had the Eggs Benedict with prosciutto.  The hollandaise sauce was barely holding the emulsion when I got it and didn't taste like much of anything.  The dish overall was bland and could have used some freshness - asparagus, parsley?  It was just heavy and blah.  The biscuit and gravy dish was a disappointment as well.  The biscuits were not fully done in the middle.  The sausage was actually good, but they were too stingy with it which resulted in another bland and heavy dish.",

    "text": "One of the best restaurants I have been to in the Valley! Conveniently located in uptown Phoenix, St. Francis is a very attractive destination for any couple or group looking for a nice restaurant to spend the evening. I enjoyed the drinks and suggested wine pairings for the three course meal they were serving during the Restaurant Week celebration here in town. Everyone on staff is extremely knowledgable and friendly. I love going to a restaurant with waiters that are knowledgable and who are invested in the success of the restaurant.  The cheesy bruschetta, chilled potato and leek soup, roman hearts salad are all excellent appetizers that I would recommend. The green pork chili verde is a savory and spicy entree. I have also tried the marinated flank steak, which was served a little over cooked and just okay at best. I am sure there are better, more affordable options on the menu.  As for desserts, I have enjoyed both the strawberry shortcake and the sticky toffy pudding. Both were extremely pleasant and the perfect way to end a great dining experience.",

I've also had the flatbread before, which I enjoyed. And I ordered the salmon when I was here for dinner which was quite good.  It's the perfect place for lunching on the patio with a glass of wine.

I had their steak with mashed potatoes and it was a little overcooked I thought that might be because they pre-sliced it. Their appetizer bread with goat cheese is great!

The baked goat cheese was good but our apps & salads came only a few mins before our entrees so we didn't have much time to enjoy them. The pumpkin soup was awesome but the pork was way under seasoned. The salmon was cooked well which if often hard to do. The chocolate cake was beyond dry and almost not edible and they ran out of the toffee desert by 830 on a not so busy Tuesday. We will probably go here again but try some others items",

    "text": "***St. Francis has a great dining room and features local ingredients; while the food was not great on our visit, it definitely showed potential***  St. Francis has one of the best dining rooms I've seen in a long time.  The dining room definitely feels hipster and young, but its design is so much better than other restaurants with a young vibe.  Typically, these type of restaurants (like Animal and Pizzeria Mozza) feel too dark, too loud, too cluttered, and maybe even too ordinary.  St. Francis though presents a very lively and young atmosphere that is really open, warm and with smart design touches.  We came in late at night, but there was a fair amount of light in the room, which really opened up the room as well as allowed some of their food presentations to shine.  The restaurant featured some great metal tables that reinforced the casual theme.  The booths were comfortable.  The ceilings were highlighted by sharp looking wood rafters (that were outfitted with expertly placed small lights).  The walls of the restaurant were a nice exposed red brick that really went well with the wood fire oven.  The restaurant also featured big, large windows that actually looked like mirrors.  The menu (a mix of locally sourced rustic dishes with upscale flair) went very well with the decor.  Unfortunately, the food was not as good as the decor though it did show potential and maybe it would have been better if we had ordered differently.  We started with the french fries, which were thick and nicely browned.  They looked like carnival fries or Five Guys fries (the kind of fries that go nicely with salt and vinegar).  They are the perfect fries when cooked right because they will be crisp on the outside and hot and soft on the inside.  Unfortunately, the fries here were not that crisp.  A little bit soggy.  We had a few of their salads.  One was a Caesar Salad with kale instead of romaine.  The kale was quite bitter.  The salad was heavily dressed (maybe to contrast the bitter greens).  The croutons were fresh and good.  The other salad was a mix of romaine with fresh and crisp apples and smoked bacon.  It had a much better flavor and balance than the Caesar Salad.  We tried a few of the flatbreads.  The flatbreads here were pretty thick and doughy and unlike the crispy and light flatbreads I am more used to having.  We had the chicken flatbread, which was roasted chicken, arugula and caramelized onion.  The caramelized onion made this pizza too sweet.  The pizza was sweet like BBQ chicken pizza so if you like that type of pizza, you may like this one.  The other flatbread was more of a traditional pizza; it was topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella and a savory and spicy sausage.  The pizza had a satisfying flavor, but it would not stand out against other good pizzas I've had.  I also had the seafood cioppino, which was shrimp, clams, mussels, white fish, sourdough, and herbs in a spicy tomato broth (finished in their wood fire oven).  I was not a huge fan of the tomato broth.  It had some heat to it, but the flavor was not that distinct.  The seafood was unevenly cooked.  Some of the white fish was moist and soft while other bits were dry.  Same for the shrimp.  One shrimp was succulent and nicely cooked while another shrimp was overcooked and quite chewy.  The mussels and clams were not that great (they definitely suffered in comparison to what I've had in California).  We finished with the sticky toffee pudding, which was a sweet date-filled cake on a toffee sauce.  The cake was nicely sweet and somewhat moist though it lacked the consistent, throughout-the-cake moistness of the sticky toffee puddings I've had at Wilshire and Grace.  The sticky toffee pudding was served with sweet cream gelato, which was creamy and refreshing.  We also had the banana fosters that seemed to be more like banana cobbler than banana fosters.  The dish consisted of banana slices in a caramel sauce.  The bananas were simply warmed up; they were not caramelized or bruleed.  The bananas were topped with a nut crumble and dark rum molasses gelato.  The dark rum gelato was very good.  It tasted like rum and was creamy and sweet.  Service was pretty causal but pleasant as well as quick and attentive.  Prices were what you would expect given the restaurant's reputation and the dishes offered.  A lot of the entrees were in the $18-$23 range.  St. Francis has a great dining room and the food definitely shows potential.  The food on our visit was not great, but if you order right, you could be in for a good meal.  The restaurant has a very local feel, which makes it a good one to try if you are from out-of-town and are looking for something more specific/unique to this area.  There is an attached parking lot with complimentary valet.",

I've been dying for a great steak or pork chop, so I had my radar aimed dead at the \"wood fired bone-in pork chop with polenta and grain mustard sauce\". Wifey ordered this salad and some polenta, and my daughter had the cheese pizza (kids meals are free here, which is awesome). We started with the baked goat cheese app that everbody raves about. It was good, but the crostini were hard as rocks and I didn't get the goat cheese taste I look for when I eat goat cheese, but it was still a good app. Wifey wasn't crazy about her salad, it was a market salad with asparagus and some other stuff. looked boring. My chop came out and looked soooo great, however.....it was just okay. I didn't get the wood fired taste in the chop, not at all. It was a bit overcooked and somewhat tough. The polenta was perfect and I really liked the mustard sauce, but the star of the show (the chop) was a disappointment. Will I go back? Yeah, I'll give it another shot. I like the restaurant and the service was good. I hope next time my food's better though, or I'll have to toss this place into the :\"let's just go for a glass of wine\" folder",

Would have liked to seen more small bites/appetizers. I absolutely loved the carmelized gold and red beet salad on a bed of butter lettuce. It was delicious! The salmon was fresh and made medium rare, and the pumpkin bisque was delicious (not too much cinnamon or nutmeg, not to sweet like squashy bisques often are). Dessert was my least favorite. We had the chocolate cake (which was more like a brownie texture). It was very dry. We were there on a Sunday night, and there were no crowds. I will definitely return for the beet salad!",

    "text": "I've only been once so far, but I was so happy to enter an architecturally trendy space with a hip vibe that doesn't suck. Laid back but most people were dressed smart casual. As much of a food snob as I can be (positively correlated with cost), I really just want decent food. Not covered up with scary sauces, not minuscule amounts of things that taste good surrounded by tons of starch, and not requiring me to bring my own hot sauce for adding flavor. This place is exactly what it seems and reportedly uses local ingredients. Yeah! Aaron chamberlain should know what the neighborhood wants by now  I think he's got it.   The Ahi tuna sandwich is the only one in the valley I have really liked. Generally I only go straight for the real deal via sashimi. Rare with bread of a correctly paired texture and an aoili fennil topping that was great.  Also the app of fingerling potatoes thanks to neighbors recommendation.  I LOVE anything that approximates a French fry and has a good sauce. They are just as described, deliciously crisp on the outside, soft on inside, large portion. My friend runs marathons, so it wasn't terrible that we over ordered on the carbs. Especially because we didn't stop there. Also HAD to order the mission fig, goat cheese, arugula flatbread. Bartender recommended and I thought for sure would be my favorite. Not so much. Not sure why, but throwing these awesome ingredients together is a bit of a science for it to wow. It was good, wouldn't order again. That's the snob in me, I know I can make it as good at home. Then again, considered how well executed everything else was, maybe they'll go over the average line next time.  Overall, Exactly as advertised which is what I like about this place, and the smallish menu emphases food of high quality.  Keep it small and do it right, I say! Cool space for bringing friends, will help fill the slowly lessening void in central Phoenix.",

Across the street from Sweet Tomatoes.  Got it now?   The building is subtle.  That's why my friend didn't recognize it as a restaurant.  The walk up to the entrance is special.  To your left you will see the bar with one side of it outside and the other of course inside for those rainy Phoenix days.  I am going to take advantage of that outside bar seating this fall.  To the right as you approach the entrance is a glass cube with a table setting on the inside.  The atrium table ended up being were we sat.  It was great.  I could watch the commute go by.  It made for airy atmosphere.  I felt warm and cozy both times I have been there.  Good lighting, wood with suspension cables, nice place settings and furniture.  Very modern with hints of retro.  The fence...  Lets talk menu.  It is small.  We were explained to that the menu would be expanding.  The second time I went to St. Francis the waitress was much better.  More informed.  My guests tried to stump her with ingredient questions and she was on the ball.  She used the word FRESH quite a bit and of course the food was fresh.  At St. Francis I have had the chicken and the sea bass.  The chicken won in my book.  I haven't been impressed with their wines.  The Pinot Noir was weird and the Cabernet was meh...  I have tried the almond margarita.  Yum.  Oh and the dessert I had.  Not so much.  Meringue bits with ice creme and figs splatted together.  Not attractive.  The ice cream and the figs were good though.  I am interested to see where St. Francis goes with its menu.",

We were the 4th couple to be seated for breakfast after waiting in the sun for 20 mins. in the sun, while others came thru the back way and got service immediately. We ordered as soon as we could and waited 40 mins with promises ever 10 mins that our food would arrive soon...that never happened.  Everyone around us was having a grand ol' time eating while we waited patiently until we finally got the message  and fled. The waiter had no remorse and just avoided us. Though we cannot prove that we were sabotaged by waiter and host, it sure looked suspicious. The manager was sweet and tried to be helpful, but just too late. She is naive regarding the inefficiency of this restaurant, and very naive about her staff. I really don't believe this was the kitchen's fault. Someone needs to talk to the nasty host we had. If you are the owner, please have the fortitude to reply to my message.   Just because you were on \"Dinners, Diners and Dives,\" in Jan. does not give you the right to experience a big ego.

    "text": "Yes, 5 stars right out of the gate for a few reasons. For a soft opening, everything went off without a hitch as far as I could tell.   First of all, the architecture was stunning! I was really blown away by some of the details like the laser cut logo in the A/C vents, the suspension cables and roll down window behind the bar. Superb job, will have architecture buffs talking for sure!   The menu was wisely limited for opening night but contained just the right mix of what is to come with the full menu. The wine selection is eclectic yet not intimidating and although not available last night, will have a white Bordeaux by the glass! My fave. We decided to eat at the bar and were well taken care of by Neil and Gina.   We started with the fingerling potatoes which were devoured in mere minutes. The rosemary was not overpowering and thankfully the dish was not over-salted. The lemon aioli was an excellent choice for the condiment. We thought about ordering another but were too embarrassed! My companion was not too hungry, so we shared the roasted chicken with pine nuts and hummus. The chicken was very juicy and the thinly sliced veggies were a perfect side along with the hummus. The presentation was beautiful as well. We were both very satisfied with 1 app and a shared entree, plus we both had about 3+ drinks in us by now, so although tempting, we passed on dessert but I won't next time!   Crowd was interesting, a few serious foodie types and couples, but I can't really tell what type of clientele will be the norm. Hopefully it will be supported by those who enjoy great food, excellent wine and fantastic service and aren't afraid to pay for it and tip well.  I am definitely going to be a regular.",

I have been to St. Francis a number of times and generally the food has been quite delightful until last night --A friend and I went for dinner--and enough things weren't right to write a review and wave a little warning flag.  my friend ordered several sides--among them were the fingerling potatoes and roasted vegetables--now when I think of roasted vegetables--i think of eggplant, squash, peppers, asparagus--but only beans and corn??  I don't think so--for the price it seemed very skimpy and not very imaginative or creative which I know the St. Francis can do.  She also ordered the fingerling potatoes--which were underdone and flavorless--this after they had been forgotten on the order and attempt made to foist a bowl of soup on my friend instead.  I ordered the white fish--which was okay but not great and was served at a temperature of somewhere between not warm and cool.  The restaurant was not terribly busy--so perhaps this was just an off night--If you can't get the simple things right like roasted vegetables and potatoes--there is something wrong in the kitchen.",

I've been coming here for years and I am so excited to finally be within walking distance of your fine establishment now that I've moved into the Central Corridor.  On my most recent trip through your doors, I came around the corner to find the ugly spray-painted mug of Guy Fieri on your lovely white wall.  A couple things crossed my mind: 1) Guy Fieri knows nothing about good food...why would he want to eat somewhere that produces such fine cuisine? 2) How big of a pompous ass must one be to spray paint their face on the wall of every restaurant they visit? 3) I really want some baked goat cheese 4) Does Guy Fieri even know what goat cheese is? 5) Why would the decision-makers at the St. Francis let Guy Fieri spray paint his face on their wall, as if to say, \"If you love TGI Friday's, you'll love the St. Francis!\" 6) The fact that I love this place, and that apparently Guy Fieri loves this place, actually bothers me more than it probably should.  I am asking in the nicest way possible: for the love of God, please get rid of that bleached-blonde, goateed blemish on your wall.  Sincerely,  A loyal and concerned customer",

All-in-all, though, some of the dishes I've had are just sorta... meh.  And not \"meh\" like \"meh, i've had better,\" or \"meh, this isn't my thing.\"  More like, \"meh, for the price, this feels like they aren't even trying.\"  That can be kind of a bummer, because this place isn't cheap.  It isn't overpriced by any means, but it is a lot of coin to drop for something that isn't very good.  This sounds really negative for a four star review, huh?  But, really!  When this place does their thang right, it is really, really tasty.  And the atmosphere is really nice; a quiet, neat-looking former firehouse with classy decor.  Nice jazz for brunch.  A roaring fire on the patio during the winter.  My recommendation: steer yourself towards something with a baked good involved (benedict, flatbread, sandwich, roasted vegetables) and you'll be golden.",

I started with the St. Francis Lemonade, a perfect cocktail to start your meal.  There are so many wonderful choices.  They are featuring a special menu for New Years, however you can order from it \"a la carte\", so we decided to start with the Arizona Citrus Salad.  It was delicious.  I love the combination of dates, goat cheese and orange slices.  I also chose from the special menu the sea scallops.  WOW, they were so sweet and tender.  They were served over a bed of black lentils, so amazing.  The portion was generous, 5 scallops, I am glad I didn't order the side of sweet corn polenta.  I ended up ordering dessert (yes my hubby twisted my arm, NOT).  I had the usual, Sticky Toffee Pudding and my hubby had the Chocolate Stout Cake.  I had a bite of his and it was great.  I cannot guarantee I won't stick to my usual dessert, but it was a closed one.  I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live.  It is such a great place.",

    "text": "One of my friends and I had perused the online menu the day before and were excitedly discussing what we were going to order on the way to the restaurant. The Yelp reviews and pictures had us very excited to try this restaurant. Our party of 3 visited on a rainy, Friday evening.  We had to wait about 20 minutes past our reservation time, but it wasn't a big deal since we were enjoying the ambiance & conversation in the little foyer. Upon being seated our waiter, whose name I fail to recall, approached our table with an undeniable energy all his own!! One of us ordered wine, one ordered a pineapple mojito and I ordered a Red Apple Sangria.  My friend was very disappointed in her mojito, saying it tasted nothing like pineapple.  My Red Apple Sangria was ok.  No real kick or distinguishing factors.   We ordered the Goat Cheese Appetizer, which I thought was delicious, but my 2 friends were not overly impressed. When our server appeared to take our dinner order, I excitedly ordered the pumpkin soup and roasted vegetables that I had seen on the online menu the previous day.  I was apologetically told that the menu had changed on Tuesday and my request was no longer available.  I was deeply saddened by this news as I am on Weight Watchers and had planned my day around this particular meal.  I then decided to try the Endless Rice Bowl with Chicken.  I thought it was declicous!  I loved the variety of vegetables and the chicken was cooked perfectly; however, you can put anything in coconut milk, and I will love it!  It was undoubtedly higher in fat & calories than what I had anticipated, but it was worth it. One of my friends requested the seafood cioppino, which had also been removed from the menu earlier in the week.  She then requested some steak dish, which she found to be too small of a portion and not very tasty. After dinner, we decided to split a dessert amongst the 3 of us.  We looked at the menu to make certain our choice from the online matched what was on the actual menu.  It wasn't.  We then decided on the carrot cake cheesecake.  Our server returned about 4 minutes after we placed our order to tell us they were out of our requested dessert, but he would buy the bread pudding for our table. Our dessert arrived hot with a nice presentation, but was not impressive as far as taste went. So- St. Francis in and of itself is a very attractive little place, with a very ecclectic decor and feel about it; however, it is not a place I willl visit again, as the only thing impressive about it was the outstanding server- Sean?",

I wish they'd put up a wall or more greenery to make it feel more secluded.  We enjoyed the Iron Skillet Pancake and the Fied Egg Sandwich. Our coffee and water was consistently refilled and our server was super friendly. Great spot overall!",

I love the look of the space, but it was quite hot inside. The menu is small, but since I wasn't terribly hungry I thought the side salad and corn bread would be perfect. Salad was very small, served in a soup cup, not nicly dressed, but as expected. One small, mini muffin sized piece of cornbread was on the plate. It was no bigger than a golf ball. When I asked about it, the server offered to bring me an additional piece, which I appreciated. Thank goodness because the first piece was so  hard, dry and way over baked, it was inedible. This never should have left the kitchen. My husband's pork sandwich was dry and boring. Sorry,  but although we try to only go locally owned restaurants, I can't imagine we will be back.",

    "text": "So sad to have to give one of my favorite restaurants a poor review, but unfortunately, it is well deserved.  I understand that ownership has changed hands and that there is a new chef.  This does not excuse getting undercooked salmon (two dinners sent back), half portion pork chile verde (happy hour price used to come with full size portion, but not anymore - what's worse - it was overcooked, stuck to the serving dish and didn't taste anything like the original delicious version they previously served) and finally a flatbread pizza with an off-putting \"sweet\" taste that salt, garlic powder and red chili flake could not overcome.  This said, the wait staff and new Manager were attentive and empathetic, which bumps the review up a star.  Please get it together St Francis...  We used to LOVE this place!",

I've tried the steak, the chicken and salmon superfood.   The steak I ordered medium rare seemed like a little small or a portion but is actually really filling probably about 10 oz.  The chicken was a huge serving. Usually I'm a bit hesitant to get roasted chicken because it can be a bit dry but not this place! Incredibly flavorful, moist on the inside and really crispy skin.   The salmon superfood was really well done and not fishy at all. I especially enjoyed the quinoa pairing. But that might just be because I love quinoa",

    "text": "Wanted to like this place, but here is the reason I could not.  First the pros:  Waitress was nice, got seated right away.  Cons: Ordered a vegetable Frittata which was supposed to have squash, green beans and carrots.  Came out with broccoli, squash, red peppers.  Sent back as I cannot eat red peppers or broccoli.  Next one came out with just carrots and squash, no green beans and the cheese was thrown on the top without being melted.  The crispy fried potato side dish were boiled fingerling potatoes with no flavor.  Next my daughter ordered the French toast.  It came out so burnt that she could only eat 1 of the 3 pieces.  The cook turned the burnt side down so as if you couldn't see it but as soon as you turned it over there it was.  Next son and daughter in law ordered the Caesar salads with Salmon.  22.50 for a salad with a small piece of salmon that was not even the least bit tasty.  Dried out and no flavor. The bowl was small and seemed like it was a side salad with the salmon tossed on the top.  Next the same bus girl who was sitting on the grass when we first arrived outside the front door with her phone, set the dirty dishes she was carrying on our table while she poured us some water. What?  How gross.  To top it all off the waitress causally added as she set the bill down,\" hey I added a 20 percent gratuity on your bill\". Not sure how a party of 6 has an automatic tip.  This was very disturbing.  I am not sure what is going on inside this restaurant but it is tumbling downhill fast.  Management better get it together or this will be closed soon.  For a Sunday the place was only at a 25 percent capacity.  Seems odd for Phoenix Brunch.",

We brought some business associates there tonight and the minute we walked in we could tell something was different. (We have not been there since the summer). The lighting was totally off - it was way too bright. I always order the salmon super food with the forbidden rice. I've been ordering it for years and I look forward to it every time we come. The salmon was a measly filet that had skin hanging off of it and was not pan seared to perfection like it has been in the past. The forbidden rice was not even cooked and was crunchy.  I immediately asked our server if there was a new chef and just as I suspected he said yes. I am devastated as this is my favorite restaurant and I would always look forward to going there for a perfectly cooked meal. Does anyone know what happened to the previous chef? I just can't imagine going there again considering the salmon was $28 and was just awful. I am SO SAD. it's NOT the same place.",

    "text": "Came for Brunch today. Place was busy. Put our name in and was told it would be a 20/25 min wait. Stood by the front door inside as it was very warm outside.  It was lovely that a server offered us water while we waited.  40 mins later we get seated upstairs.  Restaurant was pretty cleared out by then.  Only 2 tables upstairs that were already done.  Ordered cocktails. A good solid 10 mins went by. Still no drinks but our server came to take our order. I do hate that..... but figured might as well if this is the pace.  Put our entree ordered in. Drinks arrived. They were wonderful.  I had my water filled 3 times. Server no where to be seen. It's been 30 mins from our time we ordered food. Now this is getting frustrating.  I politely asked our server that appeared for some bread or something as we have waited for so long. She said our food is coming right up. Would we like more drinks. ( I would... but food would be more welcome).  Food arrived. It was delicious! She did apologize and said we can have dessert on the house.  No thanks. Was told the kitchen was backed up.   Would have been good to know in advance.  Arrived at 1:00 in the afternoon. Food down in from of us at 2:45. Really unacceptable.  I love this place..... but that was just a debacle.  No more Brunch for us.  I mean a burger... a frittata and the pig sandwich. Not exactly a hard thing to make.  Be warned if you come on a Sunday.... bring some snacks to tie you over.",

    "text": "So I wish that yelp would allow people to use half a star ratings as well, because this really should be a 2.5 rating, I was actually going to give them a 3 star rating to give them the benefit of the doubt, but as i was doing so i just remembered that they forgot the cornbread i ordered, so i put it back down to a 2. That's pretty much the theme of this rating. The restaurant itself is nice, it's a cute little spot that's somewhat trendy, a little loud and busy but nice. My boyfriend brought it to my attention as he saw it mentioned on Guy Fieri's \"Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives\" and said that he wanted to try it out because the food looked amazing. After glancing at the menu I was excited and made a reservation for that evening. When we got there we were seated promptly. A server who was not our actual server brought us our water and told us that Sidney our server would be with us shortly. That shortly was about 5-6 minutes later. When he showed up he asked us if we would like a drink and we both ordered 2 drinks and then he started to walk away and i had to stop him to ask him to order an appetizer too. We ordered the Baked Goat Cheese (which is exceptional!- probably the only good thing about this experience). It took a little longer than normal to get our drinks. When they came, my boyfriend asked what the soup was, our waiter told us, and he ordered a cup of the soup and we also ordered our meals and i ordered a side of cornbread. A few minutes after we ordered our appetizer came to the table - this was actually the only thing that we received in a timely manner. The bread was amazing, the baked goat cheese had an awesome flavor it was great. we finished the appetizer and the soup still had not yet arrived. one server walked by I asked if she could check on the soup. another 3-4 minutes passed and I spotted our server from afar look at our table (I noticed him doing this multiple times during the dinner- looking from far away, yet not actually approaching the table.) finally about 3 minutes later he came over with the soup. No apologies, just brought it, 17 minutes after we had ordered it. I had to ask him to please refill our water. when we finished he grabbed the soup dish and ignored our empty drink glasses. after about another 7 minutes or so, then he came by to tell us our food should hopefully be the next one up as he started to walk away i had to stop him to ask him for another drink. About another 5-7 minutes passed (and please make note i'm not the type of person that stares at my clock every few seconds, but i do notice when things take a while. there were 13 tables, 3 servers and a manager that were working the floor along with a bartender.) While waiting for my drink the manager came over to the table next to us to tell them that their chicken had been burned so she offered to bring them an appetizer or a salad for their wait. They got the salads which came out before we got our main entree's.10 minutes after the \"your food should be the next out comment\" our food got to the table. My drink still had not. Another instance where I noticed our server from the other end, look over at the table, realize the drink wasn't there and go to the bar to get it. The food was good. the waiter never came over to check to see how it was, when he brought my drink over i asked him for a menu because we wanted to order something to go to (my bf works graveyard and we wanted to grab him something). I also asked him to please get us some more water. He left, grabbed us a menu and filled up our water. he showed back up about 5-7 mins later to ask if we decided on what we wanted to order to go, we ordered a flat bread (which was also quite delish). a few minutes later he comes back with the bill and a comment card, I have to ask him again to fill up the water and i gave him my card. he left to run my card and promptly dropped it back off. I then started filling out the comment card. Now all of a sudden he seemed to take notice. We waited a slight while for the flatbread to come out, and because he noticed me filling out the card, for the first time came by and filled our water glasses without us asking. (I think we had to call him over at least 5 different times, which is a little excessive). The manager was next to the table that had the burnt chicken and asked how everything was. She never turned around to check on us or anything, but when she was clearing off their salad plates, i asked her if i could please give her the comment card. She said, yes and walked off and we proceeded to leave. The manager to her credit, did come out and stop us to ask us what she could do to make things better, adjust the bill, gift card, etc, we politely declined as my bf had to go to work. I do give her credit for trying, it was just too little too late. The whole experience just left us with a bad taste. - Oh and as previously mentioned, they never brought my cornbread.",

    "text": "I've been a baseball fan my whole life, and I have to say that this place hit one out of the park!  We had lunch at St Francis today and were thrilled.  There were only two of us so we had a limited sample of the menu, but everything was topnotch.  We tried the baked goat cheese appetizer and were wowed by the creaminess of the melted cheese, the piquant flavor of the tomato salsa, and the crunchy toasted baguette to spread all the goodness on. This is a winner... just go ahead and order it and you'll thank me later!  Dining partner got the Red Wine Braised Beef sandwich, with the Red Quinoa side salad. Now I must tell you, I was all over quinoa ten or fifteen years ago, before it got real trendy, and cooked it often... but always had it hot, sort of as a substitute for rice in dishes where you'd use rice.  Never ran across a recipe for it to be used cold, in a salad... REVELATION!  the dressing and other ingredients in this dish are very cleverly combined, look very nice on the plate, and provide the double whammy of (light and flavorful) with (savory and satisfying)... you could make a lunch out of it and go home happy!  The sandwich was good... grilled bread tasty... horseradish sauce brings zing and flavor... but all in all nothing to write home about.    I ordered the Pork Chile Verde... gosh I seem to order that all over town don't I?  this one is not a home run, it's more like a Grand Slam In The Bottom Of The Ninth!  OMG so smoky good, with a healthy heat index (comes with a roasted jalapeno in the stew, eat at your own risk)  A side of homemade corn bread is delicious, crumbly and just goes perfectly with the stew.  Don't be shy, just dip it in there and get it all over your upper lip... no one will blame you.  I definitely will return to this restaurant, perhaps at dinnertime... but whatever time you go, I am sure you'll enjoy it!",

It seems to wrap an urban, uptown, outdoor patio with fireplace vibe all in one!  I had the Hanger steak with green mashed potatoes and asparagus.  AWESOME.  Friends had the chicken and salmon and both delicious!  The warm goat cheese appetizer is a MUST!  Service was excellent and I'll be back soon and refer!",

    "text": "I initially wanted to check out this joint because Guy Fieri admired it (and I have thoroughly enjoyed 95% of the places he recommended on DDD). While I like to scope out places on my own, I also like to check the Food Network from time to time as well. Sadly, this is one that wasn't as great as others he visited in metro Phoenix. I ordered the olive oil, chocolate, apple pancake that Guy had and it was just alright at best. Perhaps my expectations were too high to begin with, but I anticipated a lore more out of that combination presented. It was just one medium sized pancake for $9 (ouch). So, being a bit unsatisfied with that I opted to try the mushroom, leek, goat cheese omelette and that was actually more pleasing to the palate. It was savory and rich, plus the bread with strawberry jam was a nice touch. I left with a food baby after that. I met my uncle for lunch and he wasn't impressed either with a salad he ordered (it was basic and rather small). It was a neat quaint spot, but consequently it didn't pan out the way I had hoped.",

    "text": "DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! This place is sooooo over-rated its not even funny! But if you like a horible wait staff and badly prepared, under-seasoned and over priced food, then by all means this is the place for you!   Our lunch started off with us being seated at a table that was about two inches away from the table next to us. Ok cool, I get it your trying to be the over packed swanky LA restraunt you cant get a table at, but come on. So we sat at our table(timed it) for 12 minutes with out anyone of the 15 waiters and waitresses walking back and forth by our table. Now I could see if we were sat in the corner in the back someone forgeting about us, but we were in the center of the dinning room! So after our waiter finally came up to us, after 12 minutes, he said something to the effect of... Oh no one told me they sat you, but yet he had walked by us and made eye contact with me several times what a joke. So he took our order with his nose in the air and im sure someting lodged in his bottom and procceded to leave. I ordered the $13 \"KOBE\" Beef burger medium rare. I have never had a more lousy excuse for a premium kobe beef burger in my life and trust me I know a good burger. There is no way that burger was even wagu just no flavor what so ever! My burger came out medium instead of medium rare and was underseasoned and over-cooked. I have had better burgers for $5 at a dive bar(stray cat, tempe) for real!   So after a $55 lunch that took over an hour and didn't even really leave me full or satisfied I will NEVER step foot back in this horible excuse for a restraunt and I erge you to do the same!!!",

    "text": "Went to St. Francis on our way to the children's museum. My friend was raving about the pig dip so we decided to stop and get one. We did know that kids eat free as well. Upon entering, we were greeted by an unenthusiastic man who began to lead us to the main dining room and then stopped and seated us near the door. I assumed it was because there was no room in the main dining room. We were seated and waited a couple minutes for someone to come over and get drinks. We asked if we could order the kids meals first because they were starving. The server, who was apparently not our server \"put the order in\". About 10 minutes later we ordered two entrees. I walked to the bathroom, through the main dining area to see that the dining room was not if fact full. Seems like we were placed in the entryway because we had (well behaved) children with us. A few minutes later our entrees arrived. But not the kids meals we ordered 10 minutes before. We say something to whoever dropped the food and they said \"oh ya, it's coming\". A couple minutes later they bring one of the 3 kids meals we ordered. We tell them we had two others we ordered and they said the same thing. We put the kids meals in first for a reason. All of our food finally came and we all enjoyed it. Our server never came over to see how things were or if we needed anything else. When he did we were ready for the check. He dropped the check, and we waited almost 10 minutes for someone to take it, when they didn't I tracked someone down to take it. Here is the thing that makes me madder than anything. Being treated poorly in a restaurant because we have children with us. We are not jerks, we clean up the floor and the table behind us. We tip over 20%. We factor in the cost of the free kids meals and tip on what the bill should have been. We are good customers, good to those who serve us, and we treated crappy based on preconceived notions. While we were getting our crappy service I was staring at the New Times award for the 2014 best restaurant for kids.  Good food and free kids meals aside, I doubt I will return due to the lack of respect and poor service.",

Both our meals were excellent - my husband had the French Onion Burger and I had the Seafood Cioppone.  Unfortunately, did not have time for dessert - next time.

Our table had the very delicious Fingerling potatoes for an appetizer, Salmon flatbread, Pig Dip, Roasted Salmon Superfood, and the Roasted Chicken. The standouts were the potatoes, the salmon flatbread, and the Pig Dip. The Chicken was very disappointing, not really flavorful, and a little bit undercooked in places. The service was excellent. Never once did our table need to ask for refills and were very attentive without being annoying. I would have given them four stars, but I think they are a bit pricey for the type of food they serve.",

Thank you for thinking about your tight parking on a Saturday morning. It was nice to not have to fight for a parking spot!  Then, the restaurant design is great. Although there were a lot of tables in a cozy sized restaurant, it still felt open and modern. Since it was such a beautiful day in Phoenix, we decided to sit under the grape vines! (A tropical moment in the desert.) Now onto the food: We started with the unique Cherry Vanilla Coke, it had chunks of cherries at the bottom with an almond syrup or extract and was so sweet! A fun and refreshing treat!  We also shared a small bowl of their fruit salad that was tossed in an agave nectar or honey of some sort! Fresh and local, a perfect start to a bunch!  My mom ordered the Iron Skillet Pancake. OMG! Perfect. Enough said.  I ordered the wood oven baked eggs with braised beef. It was so exciting! The seasonal veggies for me was broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes and peas. My FAVORITE, how did they know?! The beef was so tender and the whole thing was covered with cheese! The eggs... I asked for them well done, a hard job when it's oven baked without drying out the beef, but it was also perfect?! That took True talent! Amazing!  Hats off to the chefs!  As we were leaving, we noticed the bakery area. That will take a whole other review some day... I'll just say that it looked so beautiful, it looked fake. I'm still not convinced that I was dreaming it all up...",

Drinks weren't brought out, he didn't write down our orders and had to come back and ask what I wanted to eat, etc.  I thought maybe it was because they were busy, but we had a long lunch and the waiter was still MIA even after the rush was over.  My boss had to physically GET UP and find the waiter to give him his credit card so we could leave.  I see I'm not the first to complain about slow service so hopefully it's something they can fix.",

When we did finally get seated we ordered right away and the food took a while to come, but again between the ambience and the cocktails we didn't mind one bit. The food was 100% worth the wait.

Having enjoyed the place previously with a group and loving it, I was really looking forward to a return visit. Sadly, it's the service that all too often kills the experience despite the best efforts from the kitchen. The service was painfully slow. It was a good 30 minutes for our cocktail order to be delivered. Now, that's understandable when the place is packed, but it wasn't. The pacing of the entire meal expanded the work day evening out by at least an hour. The birthday girl even got up to grab a pitcher of water, after we asked for some and waited 20 minutes with our server not returning. Oddly here were several things on the menu that were not available \"for the summer\" we were told (roast chicken isn't available for the summer?) as well as several items on the wine list. Trouble at the St. Francis? That would be a shame.",

The Famous Pig Dip didn't taste as good, the baked goat cheese appetizer was the smallest portion ever with little cheese, their fountain drink machine must have been broken because drinks were flat and/or didn't taste correct, coffee was served cold (when it finally came), and the Caesar salad was completely soggy due to too much dressing.   And desserts!!   You'll have to simply pass!!!!   They said they got a new pastry chef but my 11yr old son could have prepared better.   Firstly, they were out of truffles (and we dined early), we ordered butterscotch pudding and there was on odd hardlike substance in it that none of us could discern...waiter told us bananas... well they must have been VERY ripe because they were hard and tasteless and do NOT order the lemon poppyseed cake!!!   We ALL said the driest cake we've ever tasted.   All took a bite and that was it - even with the fresh whipped cream!      Then there's the service - or lack thereof.   We sat in the very front, nice private table which was lovely but we couldn't hail a server to save our lives!   While our waitress was adorable, the service was slow, every time she did come by we would have to ask for multiple things, we had to ask for bread three times before it came (and we wanted it to eat WITH our entree).    The SADDEST PART is #1.    We had a party of 7 and they automatically added a 20% gratuity!   Because I surely wouldn't have been giving them that!   #2.  We went there because USE to be my husbands favorite restaurant and it was his Birthday.      We won't be returning.  What a shame.   We predict will be closing soon.",

The building is very interesting in design and the patio should be lovely during the cooler months, also the small outside bar area would be nice then too. The interior of the restaurant is nice and we were greeted quickly and sat under our Yelp reservation. The main dining area was pretty full of tables but the tables are big enough and far enough apart for it not to be an issue. My fiancee had the salmon eggs Benedict and an almond cherry coke and I got the Housemade biscuit and a couple Deshcutes fresh squeezed ipa's. We both enjoyed our meals a lot, although I am jealous of the eggs Benedict she got. I definitely want to try some of their other menu items and we were talking about going back for dinner. The food is good, service is good and the ambiance is nice. I would definitely recommend and will be back.",

I overhear the hostess totally give another customer crap about arriving for a reservation for two- with three people.  Saying that they mainly accommodate parties of two bc of the way their tables are set up...man up and put two tables together!! It's worth it not pissing people off or turning them away.   Next- we sit down at a long booth for six and don't get attended to for at least ten to fifteen mins.  Finally have to order the hostess to retrieve our bumbling waitress. She takes our orders. Annoying- they're supposed to be known for their bread--they didn't even have their well known baguette to order as an appetizer- pathetic.  Drinks don't arrive for another ten mins at least- after our appetizers.   It doesn't end there-  Our supposed orders arrive--they were wrong.  They forget to make my burger and arrived with some other sandwich.   The waitress didn't even acknowledge that it was her fault or anyone's.  The burger finally arrived, we ate.  The food was good and dessert was too.   In the end we should have been comp'd a dessert or something for the extended, sub par dinner.   I don't recommend this place to anyone.

I've been here several times and always had great food and service. They also have live music on Sundays starting around 10am/10:30am.  I was flying to Arizona from California regularly on business and pleasure and had heard about this place from locals.   The only tip I have for the restaurant that I hope they can improve upon is that this past Sunday I came at lunch time and it was busy. I sat down at the empty extra large table by the window to wait for my smaller table to open up (it didn't take very long) but the hostess came over and told me she needed that table and asked me to wait outside in the 110 degree weather instead. Didn't really make me feel that welcomed and while I realize that locals probably think 110 degree weather is normal, in San Francisco we rarely get a day above 70 degrees. Luckily, the wait wasn't too long so I didn't die of heat stroke in front of the restaurant but I think one idea is to offer someone a glass of water (no ice, in that kind heat) if you need them to wait outside or figure out some extra chairs or small area indoors where people can wait.",

The web site offers online reservations, which is highly recommended for a Friday or Saturday night out. If possible, ask to be seated in the upstairs mezzanine for a quieter dinner.   While small, St. Francis utilizes its space quite well. The bar area seems a little cramped but everyone was enjoying themselves when my wife and I were last there. Complimentary valet parking makes the downtown Phoenix experience that much more enjoyable.   I've heard the chili verde and meatballs are the popular dishes- but I can say first hand the roasted chicken and halibut dishes were divine. We also ordered the cheesecake in a jar- which was awesome.   Happy hour is a must - everyday from 3-6p - and allows you to partake 1/2 off all wine & beer with $5 specialty drinks. Be prepared to spend a little money but you are paying partially for an experience of downtown dining. Meet up with some friends, hang out, have a few drinks and unwind. St. Francis is the epitome of hip downtown eating.",

For entrees,  I had the chili verde (a little spicy,  and fantastic! ) my boyfriend had the steak which he gobbled up quite quickly with no offer to share  (so it must have been good) my father had the Moroccan meatballs,  also spicy but he normally doesn't like spicy food he ate all of it and loved it. My mother had the scallops, which she said were amazing.    We had desert- the apple tarte and chocolate cake The apple tarte is perfect of that's you're thing. I'm a chocolate fan myself and ate the whole thing eventhough i was full because it was so good.

At happy hour I got the morrocan meatball entree for $11 at happy hour instead of the regular price of $16. Same portion size too. It is tasty but very very filling. The cous cous on the bottom of the plate is nice but I kind of wished for more starch since the tomato sauce can get pretty tart without some starch to even it out. My wife got their infamous pork sandwich which was nice. Overall nice place and I would go back if I was in the area.",

    "text": "I finally made my way to St Francis last night... better late than never, right?  I'd been wanting to try it for awhile, so upon deciding where to go with fellow yelpers Tammar and Brad, I suggested it.  Tammar had been before but the rest of us were St Francis virgins.  Not anymore!  We made a plan to meet at 8pm but of course we were running on Jared time so while Tammar and Brad put our names on the list we were still on our way.  We arrived around 8:15 and Tammar and Brad were sitting outside by a fire lamp with drinks in hand.  According to Tammar, the total wait time was 36 minutes.  (They initially said it would be 30 - 40 so they were right on.)  We admired the restaurant as we followed the hostess upstairs to where we were seated.  While the tables are fairly close together, the accoustics were perfect.  I sat next to Tammar and had \"girl talk\" with the guys did their thing on the other side of the table.    For drinks, I went with a glass of Argentinian Malbec, which I loved.   Tammar's Ketel One cocktails seemed to go down easy, Brad had a couple of different glasses of wine, and Jared went with some indie beer, one of which was Moose Drool.  Nice name!  For food, the guys split the Green Chile Stew appetizer, T had the one and only salad on the menu (hopefully they will add another option for that in the future), and I chose to start with a side of their roasted vegetables.  Unfortunately, our waiter (Rob), must've misunderstood and I was brought a soup instead.  So by the time the mistake was corrected, the rest of the table was done with their starters.  Although I had to wait a long while, the roasted veggies were very good.  We were also served some fresh from the oven French bread and olive oil.  And I was the odd man out when it came to entrees.  The three of them went for the Flatiron Steak while I was delighted with my Seafood Stew.  We were all way too stuffed for dessert, although the warm sticky toffee pudding sounds pretty amazing.  I guess we'll just have to return to try it sometime!  All in all, a delightful dinner date... especially the pleasant ambiance, fantastic company, quality organic and fresh veggies, etc... I'm sure we'll come visit again soon, St. Francis.  Perhaps you'll consider taking reservations in the future and/or adding an additional salad option to the menu?!",

The service has always been more than accommodating and even went as far as to offer us deserts on the house because our entrees took \"longer than expected\". Crazy thing, it was only about 20 minutes! And when the drinks are flowing and the weather permits outdoor seating, who could complain?",

They didn't put my burger order in but put in the rest of the food which took just a minute (literally) longer than it took to get our iced teas.    When my burger finally arrived it was well done (I had asked for medium) so it wasn't even close to right. When we were done and paid the server brought a receipt without a line for a signature. (Not a problem for me since I wouldn't have tipped her anyway but my wife was buying.)   Trying to leave and the complimentary valet can't get the older couple in front of us Prius started. He makes them go get their own car. Are you kidding me???  We won't be back.",

Our previous visit we had to send back our eggs Benedict twice because they were cold the first time, and barely warm the second time. This visit I ordered the biscuit, gravy and eggs. Requested my eggs over medium but they were way over cooked. The server offered to take them back but I declined since the eggs were still acceptable. My wife ordered the special which was a quiche, although she liked it the food was served at room temperature. I know restaurants have good and bad days but so far we've had more bad than good.",

No, that's not a scene from a movie, I just got lucky while on vacation in Phoenix and had a taste of life after retiring. If I were to retire tomorrow, you bet I'd keep coming back to St. Francis for happy hour!  Anyway, we sat in the covered patio area and had some drinks and snacks. The Dark&Stormy (cool name) and Santa Rosa were great drinks; I had more than a few of the Santa Rosa. For eats, the Baked Goat Cheese and House Baguette were a perfect combination.  It was nice, refreshing and relaxing.",

The food is more like fine cuisine with the menu offering frequent variations including fresh herbs and vegetables from their own garden. Happy Hour begins at 3:00 and they have tasty drinks unique to them.   St. Francis is frequently busy which can affect the service and the noise level during the busiest parts of the day. If you go prepared for that you will enjoy your experience.",

Luckily, the outside bar was wide open when I arrived so I took a seat. I ordered, the scallops. unfortunately, they were a bit under-cooked for my preference. Ken the manager made contact within 2 minutes, explained they prepare this dish 'medium', and would re-prepare the dish to my taste. I had sampled the other elements on the plate prior to sending it back, and all were excellent. The roasted heirloom carrots were cooked perfectly, the dill accented both the creamed/mashed potatoes and the roasted carrots very well. I have no problem stating that all flavors on this plate were De-lish!  About 4 minutes after sending the scallops back for more heat, I realized that I was going to be late for the show at Phoenix Theater. I felt really bad about requesting the dish be re-cooked, as I now had to leave.....Ken intercepted 1/2 way to the exit, with the dish in a to-go bag assuring me he did not want me to go home hungry.... Sorry Ken.... and thank you for assuring a positive experience. You are absolutely an asset to this business!!!",

Each time I've  been here the friends I'm with and I will just order items and share everything. The appearance of the dishes are almost as amazing as the taste, but  the flavor takes the cake for sure.  I really enjoy this spot its small but very nice for date night   only negative... the people that work there can be more attentive. the host took us to a dirty table and the old dishes remained on the table for too long after we were done with an them. Also they can offer more knowledge of the dishes and wine pairing.",

    "text": "Without a doubt, my favorite burger spot in Phoenix.  The Chile Burger and the French Onion Burger are both masterpieces.  The beef is amazingly fresh and flavorful with the right ratio of meet to fat.  I always get mine medium/rare.  The buns are always fresh and soft.  And they aren't skimpy either.  Some high end spots in town...who shall be left nameless...give you these tiny little burgers (almost sliders) and think charging you $15 (a-la-carte, mind you) is fair.  Not St. Francis!!  No sir!!  Big, beefy, juicy, loaded burgers with a generous side of perfectly fried, hand cut French fries for about thirteen bucks!  Great deal for a filling, high quality, gourmet burger experience.  My friend Tanner swears by the pork chops.  I've never tried them, but next time I go, I might have to get a side of pork chops with my burger!!  (To my wife: That was a joke).  Guy Fieri has featured St. Francis on Triple D, and the first time I went I had the sandwich that was featured on the show (the Pig Dip).  Wasn't a huge fan.  But the burgers are another story.  Again, THE BEST IN PHOENIX.  Very convenient parking, indoor/outdoor seating, full bar, relaxed and comfy atmosphere, friendly wait staff.  Highly recommend for a casual afternoon lunch or early evening bite before hitting the town.",

We got there right at 11am when they open and by noon it was packed.  We felt little under dressed given most of the lunch crowd was business professionals but the staff treated us no different.  We actually came in for the Pig Dip, which the hubs got, but to our surprise it was the White Flatbread that stole the show.  I almost didn't order it because I wasn't sure if I would like the dates but it was amazing.  It was sweet but savory and the creamy goat cheese just melted like butter. The Pig Dip was good as well but it was a lot of pig and heavy.  Like food coma heavy, would be the perfect sandwich after a night of heavy drinking.  Oh and I forgot to mention that despite it's posh feel, it was actually really cheap!  Our bill was under $35 and that was for two entree's, a glass of wine, and a glass of beer. Seriously I was the second cheapest meal (behind In-N-Out) we had on vacation and the most memorable.  I will replicate that flatbread at home until we vacation in Phoenix again just so we can go back to St. Francis.",

I made a reservation via OpenTable and after a few minutes of watching the hostess fumble around, she said she located our reservation and we were taken to our table. (Side note: later that day, I received an e-mail from OpenTable informing me that I was a \"no show\")  Our experience started out nice enough with prompt service, however, while we were eating, we could not find our server. Our waters and coffees were empty and we were desperate for refills. When we finally spotted her, we could not get her attention. She tended a couple other tables, then stood at the server station while flirting with another server. It was infuriating. Especially with other wait staff walking around the restaurant and no assistance. Do colleagues not help each other? We finally got her to refill our beverages. My mom also requested additional sugar packets for her coffee, however, our server just went about her business, so we finally had to flag down another server and he kindly brought us more. A couple minutes later, she drops off a whole container without a word.  Thank goodness the food was tasty!  Cheddar Herb Scone ($5): The scone is a daily selection and I'm very pleased with the one we had. It was delicious! Great texture and flavors. I'm a huge fan of savory scones and this is definitely one of the best ones I've had. I was tempted to order another one if it wasn't for the price tag.  Cinnamon Roll with caramel sauce ($6): This is HUGE! And importantly, delicious. I really liked the caramel sauce that was fortunately not too sweet. We couldn't even finish half of it, so we took it home and it made a nice snack.  Crispy Fingerling Potatoes ($11): Tossed with rosemary, sage, and Parmesan; served with lemon aioli. The potatoes were delightfully crispy with tender interiors. I loved the flavors of the fresh, fragrant herbs and salty, nuttiness from the Parmesan. The aioli was also a great compliment. My mom and I love potatoes and we were really digging this dish!  Farmer's Market Frittata ($10): A thin \"pancake\" of eggs is topped with market fresh vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, tomato, mushroom, baby spinach), sun-dried tomato, pickled red onion, and cheddar. I was really disappointed with this dish. Pan-fried eggs with vegetables tossed on top is NOT a frittata. Even if I ignored the name, it was flavorless and boring! The vegetables were barely heated through. Silver lining: It's a great low-carb option. Just pretend it's called Vegetable Medley & Eggs.  Chorizo Scramble ($10): Eggs with chorizo, spinach, salsa, and jack cheese. Served with a slice of Brick Oven Baguette. This was tasty. Solid brunch choice for those that like it a little spicy. Ruben really enjoyed it.  Chicken Chopped Salad ($14): Mixed greens, avocado, dates, almonds, and medium-boiled egg. My mom and I both loved this salad! The dressing was light and flavorful, but not overpowering. Everything was fresh and I loved the crunch from the almonds. A very generous serving of chicken as well.  We also took home two Brick Oven Baguettes ($3/each) - bonus: they're Vegan! They seem to have a sourdough aspect? They have a great crust like that on my favorite pizzas.  The food was (mostly) really great, however, our experience left much to be desired. It's truly a shame. I'm not sure any of us would be excited to return.  FYI: Complimentary valet only. Really odd considering the lot is very small and when we retrieved our car, he handed us the key since it was so close to the restaurant and exit. So very odd. Anyway, I felt so bad for the valet because it was SO hot outside!",

I feel like their menu is a little on the limited side for breakfast, but what they do....they do well. My friend got the Eggs Benedict which had smoked salmon, and it was fabulous. It seems like they have some great fresh baked goods that looked yummy when they were being served. My only complaint really was that I ordered a fruit salad...and what I got were chopped up apples with a few blueberries and tart strawberries thrown on top. That was a little bit of a letdown- but now I know!",

    "text": "St. Francis is trendy, hip, and popular. It's on Camelback Rd. in Central Phoenix, a road filled with other unique and trendy restaurants. There is usually a pretty long wait on weekends. They do take reservations (for larger parties I think). St. Francis usually uses local, in season produce, so the menu sometimes changes.   They have different seating options: - Inside and outside (depending on weather) bar - Upstairs dining - Outside patio with neat lighting - Downstairs dining room with open brick walls - I like the table right by the entrance that has glass walls. Although it's too warm in the summer.  Menu recommendation: The flatbreads are basically a personal pizza. And they're amazing. I really like the prosciutto (and fig?) flatbread. Nice blend of sweet and salty. The crust is pretty crisp; love it.",

    "text": "Nice, little trendy restaurant with complimentary valet service.  I almost couldn't believe that it was complimentary and my mother kept trying to give the guy some money for parking our car.  Upon entering, we were immediately attacked by some wood or bark that fell off a top shelf and almost nailed my mom in the head.  I helped pick up the mess before we were shown to our table.  We were seated in the middle of the restaurant, but they let us move to a better table near the back.  Water came out a few minutes later, which is a good sign.  We ordered a few drinks from the HH menu: an almond margarita and some type of lemonade, cucumber concoction.    I didn't care for the cucumber drink, so I stole the margarita from my mom.  I specifically wanted to try their Pig Dip sandwich, because I had seen it on Triple D and Guy raved about it.  The Pig Dip is not on the HH menu, but their kitchen approved my request.  We also decided to try their Moroccan meatballs.  Okay, the plates are huge and make it difficult to navigate due to the small size of their tables.  I'm not referring to the portions. I'm talking about the strange wood plates they use when serving hot dishes straight out of their wood-fired oven.  Now, the food really leaves a lot to be desired.  At this point, I had been enjoying myself, but the food detracted from the overall experience.  The meatballs have a decent flavor, but they are INCREDIBLY salty.  I probably wouldn't order them again.  The Pig Dip sandwich is served with an au jus-like sauce and French fries.  The fries were absolutely delicious, but the au jus had too much vinegar or something.  It made the sandwich taste terrible and I couldn't figure out what it was until I stopped dipping my sandwich in that awful stuff.  The Pig Dip by itself isn't too bad, but it certainly isn't one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.  It isn't even in my top 5.  This was slightly depressing, because Guy made it seem like something special.  It clearly wasn't.  It also cost $16, which makes it one of the most overpriced sandwiches I have ever had.  Listen, St. Francis, I have eaten far better sandwiches than your Pig Dip for almost half the price.  I realize that you make most of the ingredients in-house, but that is just a ridiculous price for an average sandwich.  In sum, St. Francis offers an interesting combination of products, a great HH menu, and utilizes attractive decorations to make their customers feel comfortable.  I would probably go back.",

We were there for late lunch, so we were seated right away. Service was pleasant but not terribly efficient. Entrees were not brought out all at one time, and drink refills were spotty. A requested side of bread and butter never arrived.       The lunch menu is tiny, but the items sounded interesting. The soup, celery root with apple puree was a winner. The romaine salad was nice and fresh and well dressed. Portions are large. However, our hamburger was disappointing. It was way too salty, but the french fries were even saltier. And it was expensive for what it was, $12 for a burger no better than Indulge or Blue Burger.       I'd be willing to go back and give dinner a try, but I understand that the wait is long, and the noise level excruciating. We'll see.",

The waitress had wonderful recommendations since I was undecided on what to order. I ended up ordering the fried egg sandwich with fries. It was amazing! The roasted red peppers made the sandwich.

    "text": "Last night I went there with a friend and had a perfect evening.  It's not often when I'll drive from Cave Creek to central Phoenix but this was really worth it.  I wanted to try something different from our usual places so I searched on Yelp for some good ideas.  St. Francis jumped out at me because that's the name of my patron saint so how could I go wrong there?  I made a reservation for 2 at 6:45 on a Saturday evening, Wow.  We arrived 5 minutes early so we had an actual wait of about 10 or 12 minutes before we were taken to the best table in the place overlooking the bar area.  The place was really busy and I had thought we would have a longer wait but thanks for the surprise.  Our waitress, Monique, showed up quickly and took our drink orders which also arrived quickly.  After discussing various items on the menu my date ordered the market vegetable flatbread and I ordered the green chili verde with pork chunks and with a egg on top.  We each also ordered a bowl of scrumptious pumpkin soup for a starter.  The pumpkin soup was as good as I used to get in the British Virgin Islands where it's served everywhere.  My date and I shared a bit of our meals back and forth a little.  The flatbread was fresh and loaded with great vegetables, and in spite of being something I would never order I actually liked it a lot.  The chili verde with pork chunks was incredible, it had a really good flavor with a very gradual heat buildup.  The egg on top turned out to be two of them and they made a nice contrast with the chili.  Our waitress was one of the best I have had anywhere.  Monique came by regularly to see how we were doing but she was never intrusive.  She made great recommendations, showed us great service, and there was no rush or pushiness.  We'll be back to St. Francis and I'll insist on having Monique take care of us again.  Boy, it's a long drive back up to north Cave Creek but the evening was well worth it.",

I decided it was the perfect day to check it out, my hubby offered to take me out to lunch today for my birthday (he's a keeper!), so this was my choice.   I LOVE the architecture of the building, so much eye candy! We asked our server what used to be in this building & she told us it was an old Dentist office. The bathrooms were so cool! I love that the toilet paper roll was on a rod coming out of a safe on the wall & the flat sink was so interesting.   We arrived right at noon & the place was almost full, with about 2-3 tables available. The hostess promptly sat us & we gazed over the menu. Hubs ordered his usual Dr. Pepper, since it was my bday I ordered a cocktail. My 1st ever mojito! It was made with mint of course, lime & pineapple rum. Not a drink I would order often but I liked it, very refreshing! For an app we ordered the baguette with olive oil. It came out sliced, about 7 pieces, with a tiny cup of olive oil. Tasty! For our entrees hubby ordered the turkey & avocado sandwich & I ordered the pork chile verde. He said his sandwich was just ok but I loved my stew! It had so much yummy flavor & the cornbread that came on the side was fabulous!! Using the bday card again, I decided to order some dessert. I ordered the chocolate cake; which came with peanut butter gelato, caramel & caramel corn. It was delicious! The only reason i couldn't finish it was because I was already full from lunch & I ran out of gelato, I always mess up the cake to ice cream ratio!   The hostess came by to ask how our meal was & I told her it was excellent & that I was glad to have finally tried it out on my bday. She then told our server it was my bday so she took the dessert off of our tab. That was so sweet of them! So total with tip & minus dessert was about $45. A little pricey for lunch but totally & completely worth it in my opinion! We will definitely be back for dinner sometime :)",

The Pig Dip was amazing, great flavor and size, au jus was good. Wife had the chicken salad sandwich which she said was great and refreshing. Both sandwiches had flavorful homemade rolls! Good beer and mixed drink list. Hope we can make it back soon and try breakfast or dinner.",

It's one of those restaurants that you wish you lived closer to, so you could become a regular.  The service is friendly and the wait staff has a effusive manner.  We ordered the Eggs Benedict with the standard english muffins and hollandaise sauce, skipped the potatoes for $13.00, along with the Farmer's Frittata for $10.00.  Both were very good.  The Frittata's taste lingered well after our meal, but in a good way.  It was light and had a nice mixture of flavors.  All the food came promptly and we had time to sit back and enjoy our meal.  It also gave us an opportunity to  browse the efforts of the interior designer and architect on the space.  I think I would call it light and breezy, as was our meal.  Enjoy!  .",

Great romantic ambiance, dim lighting in what seems to be a converted loft with high ceilings. Sat on the second floor and was able to watch the talented bartenders craft drinks. Chicken salad sandwich was good and so were the fries. Not too greasy or creamy. Santa Rosa cocktail was made with fresh grapefruit juice and basil. It was very refreshing, one of those drinks that can really get me into trouble.    Kind of a miss:  Smoked salmon flat bread was okay. Not enough salmon or creme fraiche. Romaine salad was tasty but tiny.  St. Francis  for dinner... I wanted to like it, but it fell short for me. Maybe brunch next time.",

We were offered a drink as we waited, spotted a kids area for those of you who have kids.  As we were seated there was a live jazz performance.  Began to look at the menu and was pretty skeptical with the menu as it seemed like pretty regular brunch. Boy were we in for a great surprise! We ordered:  Sparkling pineapple lemonade-  good to the last drop just absolutely refreshing and tasty for a hot Phoenix Day  Fried Egg Sandwich- my husband got this amazing sandwich, doesn't seem like it would be anything special right?  Wrong! It is pretty much one of the best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had, that bacon and chipotle aioli sauce is just amazing.    Eggs Benedict with Pork Loin-  our friend opted for this and it turned out to be quite tasty as well! The eggs were cooked perfectly (something we always look for in a benedict) and the pork loin was perfectly flavored with it.    Pork Chili Verde-  My choice, the pork chili came with corn bread and most importantly HOT! This dish was more spicy than I thought it would be which is a plus because I like spicy.  Those flavors packed into this tiny skillet.  You have to try and dip french fries into this, it was like pork chili fries.    Even with the wait, can't go wrong.  Absolutely love it here, they will be seeing me more often!",

However when we sat down it took 20 minutes for a server to even come over to our table as we sit here drink less. When the server finally came we placed our order as we ordered drinks and now we see people seated after us getting food it's been another 30 minutes since we ordered and still no food. I had such high hopes for this place going in, but I am currently so discouraged on coming back.  UPDATE: I went inside and asked for the manager, he came out and somewhat rectified the situation. Because of how kind and helpful he was I will update my star review from 1 to 3 stars.",

Two people in our party had the veg flat bread and got FOOD POISONING  - Vomiting and Diarrhea all night and the next day - Thanks great way to screw up our vacation. Oh also service was awful but that I could have lived with. Do yourself a favor skip this place its a vacation killer. To add insult to injury I called the Resturant the next morning at 9am and spoke to a individual and they said a manger would call me back. At 2:30 the following day since I never received a call I contact St Frances Resturant and spoke to Greatchin she asked me to hold and she would get me a manager - she came back and said manager Cory was not available. Gretchen then said she will give the message to Ken and he will call me back. He never did. I waited 5 days before I posted this. I would assume since there was no concern in what happened they may be used to receiving these calls. This ones a dive",

(number of drinks - wink!)  This is St. Francis Restaurant and you better try it out Succulent Pork Chops that your momma talked about King of the flatbreads And I'm here to have a meal The Chile Verde in my belly in this fine establishment  It's the patron saint of the appetite With an angel face and a taste for great serviced foods! (Lyrics - Green Day - St. Jimmy)  As I said this over and over; I don't know St. Francis, but I love this place.  Maybe that's why he's a saint.  This place rocks!    The place itself is a rustic homey feel that has an open kitchen.  Reminds me of spring time in a farm.  It's really relaxed and chill.  There's a nice patio to the East with a fire place and upstairs is another level of dining.  Complimentary valet which is recommended.  I ordered the Pork Chile Verde which came with a side of corn bread.  This pork was perfectly braised and fell apart perfectly into the chile sauce.  It is pretty spicy so if you can't handle the heat -- well like they said go get yourself a beer! Right!?  My partner ordered the Pork Chops --- she didn't go wrong there.  It was perfectly done; moist in the middle and succulent!  We both shared the Goat Cheese Bites and man it hit the spot.  Nice, warm, and creamy; along with the crunchy crostini -- mmm!  Service overall was a delight!  Very knowledgeable and their recommendations was spot on making our night one to remember.  St. Francis is a gem and was voting best new restaurant when they first opened back in 2010.  Ever since then their awards and accolades resonate well once you try this place out. - Enjoy!",

The staff are friendly and attentive, it's a favorite early dinner spot for us.  Thanks St. Francis!  PS:  If you have the kids with you, they eat free.

Not once was I offered to have my empty water cup refilled and finally it was filled up after asking 3 times. My burger was good, but the fries came out feeling like half frozen Oreda's. However, the waiter took so long to come back after dumping off our food that I had finished my burger by the time I could even tell him about the fries. When I finally told him he very awkwardly said, \"ugh, I could get you some new ones, I guess?\" Another server brought out the side of fries later and tried auctioning off to the table next to us (don't tickets have table numbers labeled?) which was kind of awkward, too. Essentially my friend and I ended up splitting some new (piping hot) fries after we were done with our entrees. When the runner dropped the fries I also said we were done with our entrees and she said she would send a busser to clear our plates. Well, about 30 minutes after staring at our empty, dirty dishes they were finally cleared.   My friend made the mistake of attempting to order a second beer which took over 15 minutes to receive. Once again, we heard someone try to deliver it to the table next to us and then the runner just left with the beer. Our original waiter came rushing out with the beer a few minutes later. We were there over two hours because everything moved so slowly. It's a shame because the ambiance is so nice and the area is convenient, but there's no way I would go back.",

    "text": "Stylish and hip yet humbly manages to stay comfortable and understated; St. Francis is almost one of the best restaurants I've visited in a long time.   There are enough interior design details to satisfy our inner Martha and a menu that's well presented and executed, so why the \"almost\"? The service was off. Our servers couldn't decide who we belonged too, another table's food was served to us, then our salads and soups came out with the entrees, huge no-no. For a restaurant that's been open well over a year, these kinds of rookie mistakes, while forgivable, are just out of place and confusing. It's a fact we all have off days, they clearly were having theirs.  In the semi-open kitchen you'll see their custom built wood burning oven which is the cooking method for many of the dishes on the menu. Now maybe I'm nitpicking, but normally at this caliber of restaurant, bread is simply part of the service. At St. Francis to get a few slices of their fantastic house made baguette, served with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt ($2) you'll have to ante up. I know it's only a few bucks and really is a sign of the times, but really? So the bread was chewy and had an excellent developed flavor, okay it was worth it.   When our Meatballs ($12) with Moroccan spice, tomato sauce, egg and olive oil toast arrived I swear there was cheese on top. After one bite of these meaty spheres there was no cheese at all, ends up the egg was so light and airy that it had a cheese like texture. This is that one dish that will keep me coming back over and over, such a taste departure from the typical Italian style.   I'd highly suggest ordering the fork tender Pot Roast ($17). Better than moms, it was served with sweet corn polenta, bok choy, carrots and tomatoes, rustic and deliciously fulfilling. The white fish of the night ended up being a thick fillet of Mexican Grouper ($23). Like everything else, perfectly cooked, the plump flavorful fish was served with carrots atop a pillowy mound of mashed potatoes. If you're craving a burger, try the French Onion Burger ($13) with its smoked bacon, Gruyere cheese and crispy onions, its a beautiful thing.      Sticky Toffee Pudding ($7) with sweet cream gelato, was an excellent way to end such a great meal.   The food at St. Francis was on point with every dish being excellent. I look forward to an on day when the service matches the food.",

I was the lucky person to select the pig dip sandwich that was coincidentally crowned with a blonde hair. Never mind the fact that apologies are NOT offered at such a prestigious establishment, it's just swept under the rug and keep it moving with a fresh sandwich. On try 2 with the pig dip, my jaws were fatigued from chewing the thick sourdough bread with the heavily crisped and somewhat charred crust. Onto this burger that has World renowned known accolades. This was an eye opener for me to humble myself! Evidently seasoning is no longer in style on burgers, nor sauces. The fries were excellent, but unfortunately the best part of the meal. The mixed drinks were creative and tasty and the ambience was super trendy and fun. Overall, I would not go back because one typically goes to a restaurant to eat and in this case based off of the food I would've given one star but the service and the ambience boosted this spot to three stars.",

It was the first place I sat when I finally got to--the second day they started serving lunch, in fact, for a friends birthday. One word of caution and slight disappointment is the path leading to the main entrance... it's not exactly paved, so it could get messy on a rare rainy AZ day. And it's not just the physical space, but the musical space that St. F delivers... It is Indie Music Paradise and I LOVE IT. I even have a playlist in iTunes gathering up all the songs I hear. Overall, their track list is fairly small in terms of rotation... I heard several of the same songs repeated every time I visited (A total of 4, but the first 2 times I was there to get a GC, then to make reservations). I heard The Shins, Fleet Foxes and Nouvelle Vague. But it's growing because last time I heard Radiohead, Portishead, Supreme Beings Of Leisure and Feist to name a few more.  For my first dining experience, I had an open faced sandwich... I think it was pulled pork... with butternut squash and sauteed spinach... It was tasty and pretty filling--I brought 1/2 of it home for another meal. I wished it came with fries like the French Onion Burger a few of my co-workers had to round it out, but in the end, I didn't need  to as one of them was \"being good\" and gave me her fries... SCORE! They were definitely generous in serving size and pretty tasty. Other co-workers delighted in an Ahi Tuna Salad (Or was it a sandwich...?)... and I believe everyone loved their Ice Tea.  The second time I went was for dinner... again, for a friend's birthday and this time I got to sit upstairs. I was secretly hoping we would be seated up there after discovering they had a second floor... 2-story restaurants are few and far between here in AZ, land of low and horizontal sprawl. We were seated at the furthest end of the 1/2 boot seating... so had a great view down to the bar... the large garage door was raised all the way up, so we got some fresh winter air.   A couple of my friends got the Baked Goat Cheese, Tomato, Walnut Herb Pesto and Toasted Bread for Appetizers, so I got to try a taste. Yup, Goat cheese is too strong a flavor for me.  I decided on the Wild Mushroom Risotto with Oven Dried Tomatoes and Parmesan Froth. Yes, froth, see picture for effect. My favorite part of the flavors in the dish were from the oven dried tomatoes... makes me want to experiment at home because they were heavenly... I wished I had more than 2 on my plate. The mushrooms surprised me as they packed a lot of flavor, too... usually I think of them as pretty mild, but they definitely offset and added to the creamy cheesy risotto taste. When I order this dish again, I will make sure and ask for extra Tomatoes... YUM. Again, a friend declined her potato side... this time the extra thin Crispy Potato chips and we all got to try them. They were VERY thin, quite possibly the thinnest chips I've ever had and had varying texture and taste... some were pretty plain, others salty and others still with a hint of vinegar... it was like a box of chocolates! Ba dum DUM! It was funny, we looked like potato connoisseurs chip tasting. I also got a bite of my friends Peppered Crusted Steak and it was really good! I am not often a steak orderer--pepper crusted at that (usually find the flavor to be too strong), but I would order this one.  For dessert, we had the most interesting one on the menu: Warm Sticky Toffee Pudding, Sweet Cream Gelato. Be forewarned it's not pudding as in a pudding cup. It's bread pudding, but as a yelper said, it was more like a cake. I liked the flavor... it reminded me of (Buttter) Rum Cake... which I like when the Rum doesn't over power the entire dish. Sweet Cream Gelato? I assumed it was Vanilla and the melted toffee made it hard for me to think anything otherwise. If I have it again. I will have to take note of it's subtle flavors alone.  I have to go back at least 3 more times... to try out a new area of restaurant. I still have yet to eat in the main portion of the first floor dining space, the patio and the bar. I'm REALLY curious about their cocktails. I've heard good things about the Meyer Lemonade... love mojitos... and there's is pineapple infused one so I want to try that it (It's the island girl in me)... Heck I think I want to try every specialty drink off the menu! Good thing St. F's in my 'hood.  The only thing I can say is a detriment is the price--it's quite pricey and a lot of the dishes are small, but if you're creative and share it's doable without too much of a hit to your pocketbook. Or, if not, go here as a \"treat\" place. Definitely a place to bring a special someone or celebrate a special occasion.",

I want to touch on just one menu item, the Eggs Benedict.  I haven't been able to eat said food for about 5 years now after a horrible food poisoning experience in Mexico brought on by bad hollandaise.  It is my fiance's favorite breakfast food and every time he orders it I try it and every time I can barely choke it down.  Not the case here!  I tried it, I loved it, I wish I ordered it myself!  I ate not only a bite or two of his, but our dining companion as well.  Just thinking about it right now makes my mouth water.  In a good way.",

Very grateful the Good Egg was standing room only. We walked across the street and we were glad we did.  The eggs benedict and biscuit and fennel sausage were both excellent.  Service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere exceptional with a live jazz group.   Sipped a perfect Bloody Mary while we were waiting.  Felt like we were on vacation.",

    "text": "Where to begin.  I REALLY want to like this place and I'll start with the GOOD.  I love the bread and the Pork Chili Verde is good.  Oh and that St Francis lemonaid with the honey vodka is GREAT.  I've been there at least 4 times, but I'm not enough of a fan to go back because I crave it.  It's usually because someone I'm going with hasn't tried it yet and I'm going along to see if it's gotten better.   Maybe I'm wrong or maybe this isn't my kind of place, but for all intents and purposes THIS SHOULD BE.... The decor is great, the area is where all my favorite places are, the owner/chef is really nice all the time, but I just don't get it... I don't LOVE IT.  Couple of things that are a little CONS... I don't get why the part where you walk in is all gravel, it makes the entrance confusing since the sidewalk leads to the BACK.  I've had 2 instances were I've been treated in a CHILLY manner by the 2 different hostesses.  Alright, I'll just say it, they were kinda rude. That being said I go to a lot of places where I don't love the service, but I go back because at the end of the day, I can't get the food that I like anywhere else.  In regards to St, Francis I can get this food many other places.  It's honestly just blah.   I'd take my grandparents here and honestly they'd love it, but I don't think that's a selling point. The food needs some UMPH! I need some flavor that makes my mouth water. I'll keep my fingers crossed that it gets better, I really want a new local hangout place since a lot of places that are non chain have been closing up these days.",

I found it to be a very cool spot with friendly, efficient bartenders and servers, diverse (yet relevant) menu and handsome architecture. I love the open airy-ness about the restaurant and the combination indoor-outdoor bar area.  The brick oven is impressive, the wines are exciting and the food is phenomenal.  Everything is very reasonably priced, including drinks.  Parking is valet-only, but it's complimentary. St. Francis is the perfect place for drinking wine with friends, and has definitely been added to my happy hour rotation.  It also strikes me as a great \"date\" spot. Not that I'm in any danger of needing to be concerned about that.   For as cool as this spot is, nobody there seems to be up their own a$$ about it. The ever-increasing cloud of smug I've noticed in Phoenix has definitely passed over St. Francis.",

For the most part, I thought the prices were high considering the quality and complexity of the dishes, and the service. I got the seafood stew, which was highly recommended by the server. It was extremely fishy smelling, but that didn't put me off as much as the shrimps in my stew tasting like it had been brined in some kind of chemical. It tasted almost like they bleached the shrimp or something -- a very chemical, kitchen-cleaner-esque taste. The rest of the seafood in the soup was fine, but the shrimps were inedible because of the chemical taste.   We got the sticky toffee bread pudding to share and it was great -- certainly the best part of my meal.",

All of the glassware and other service items were pretty and perfect, actually. Notably so.  We had the carrot soup and romaine salad with buttermilk cheddar dressing for our apps. The carrot soup, amazing. The salad would be amazing anywhere else, but given how good the rest of our meal was, we found the salad relatively lacking. RELATIVELY.   For dinner, I went with the seafood cioppino and he had the strip steak with fingerlings and onion... both were definitely top shelf all the way. Full flavors, the broth in the cioppino was so, so good, and all the veggies on his steak were just perfection.

    "text": "I had heard just a little bit about St. Francis before planning my visit, but everything I had heard had been so good I knew it was on the top of my list of new places to try.  St. Francis may have even exceeded my high expectations.  We got there just after 5:30pm--able to park and walk from a friend's house in the neighborhood across the street.  The other member of our party had warned us she was going to be a little late.  Initially the hostess wouldn't seat us until our whole party arrived, so we got a drink at the bar--fun indoor/outdoor set up.  Bar food = amazing...can anyone say on-the-house dishes of olives, house-made chips, toasted nuts, and thin-crust cheese pizza.  The drinks were also good.  A nicely made, strong gin and tonic.  When I ordered it with extra lime, they gave me three pieces--good sign.    Toward 6pm, just as things started to fill up (they only take reservations for 6 or more, and its very popular), the hostess approached me, confirmed that the other members of my party were close on their way, and seated us--so nice.  The food was incredibly savory--AMAZING.  Since we had already sampled the pizza at the bar, we ordered the baked goat cheese with tomatoes and pesto, and the ahi-tuna sandwich to share.  Our friend ordered a burger which looked delicious.  Chips (which were yummy) and pickled veggies (which were admittedly not the tastiest to me) came with the dishes.  I am still craving the ahi-tuna sandwich.  It was a thick ahi-steak cooked perfectly to melt in your mouth perfection.  It was on a perfect, buttery roll...it had a drizzle of aioli.  I can't get it out of my mind and a part of me wishes I wouldn't have shared (even though it was certainly large enough).  I'm dragging everyone I know here asap.  So delicious, friendly staff, relaxed environment, and great building.    Extra information: The building is two stories, it opens at 4pm (no lunch, damn), and there is a little kids meal for all you hip parents with free meals for little ones.",

    "text": "First off, as my inaugural YELP review, I would be remiss if i did not throw a shout out to all that blazed the trail before and left me a path.  Thanks to all who have submitted great critiques.   As a recent transplant to Phoenix I have relied heavily on using the recommendations I have found on yelp to try local venues.  I must say I have discovered plenty to appease my wife and my east coast and west coast sensibilities (respectively).    Today I took my family to St. Francis for the first time and it rocked our world.  Despite what other posters have noted, we had really good service from the valet right through lunch.    The food was really, really great.  Perfectly prepared, ample portions. Although a tad noisy the atmosphere was very cool too. The value was off the chart. One of the few times I got my tab after a meal and had to double check because I thought they under-charged me.   One thing that really blew my mind was an amazing kids entree that was free.  Are you kidding me?  My daughter is like the pickiest eater alive and she inhaled her food.  You can't make this stuff up, when we were seated she asked \"what's that delicious smell?\" and after devouring her food she said it was the best food ever (hurting my feelings a bit as the one who cooks at home).    For my family I think we all agree that this place \"speaks to us\".   Its nice to know that someone realized just because you have a kid doesn't mean you want to crawl under a rock and that maybe you you still want to enjoy some of the finer things in life with your family.    We will probably Make this our official stomping ground (sorry LGO) and whenever some visits us from out f town it's good to know we have a go to spot to \"represent\" what we think Phoenix lifestyle is all about.",

I had the almond margarita which was a delicious twist on a favorite classic of mine.  We also had the goat cheese which was wonderful and full of flavor.   Unfortunately this is where the food goes south.  I ordered the New York strip medium rare.  It was tough and just a bad cut of steak and the flavor was charcoal like.  Yuck.  The two sides mushroom ragu and kale were just sour.  It was a horrible pairing.  My date had the swordfish which wasn't bad but I could smell it.  If something smells too fishy it makes my nose crinkle.   Maybe there was a hidden reason why it's taken this long for me to get there as it was not that good.  Not sure if I'll be back.",

    "text": "I was excited to visit St. Francis after seeing the great reviews and scores, but I was unfortunately disappointed with both my meal and the service. We were seated at a table that honestly should not exist. It was right in the flow of traffic, so servers were squeezing by each other next to our table the entire visit. I would have rather waited for another table to clear.    We waited way too long for our food...I would guess it was close to an hour. Our server apologized a couple times. At one point, he told us our food was being plated, but it was still another 20 minutes later before we were served. I ordered the Parmesan Shrimp Risotto. The risotto was prepared well, but it had no flavor. I think they may have forgotten the parmesan. There were only four shrimp on the plate, but they were tasty.  Thankfully, my dinner partner enjoyed his flatbread pizza.   After being there so long, I decided against dessert and also against arguing how I was charged two dollars more for my meal than the price on the menu. I see that I was charged correctly according to the price on the website, but I must have been given an old version of the menu when I was at the restaurant.  Sadly, I will likely not return to St. Francis.",

Food quality is exactly on par with other local restaurants, so I'm not sure why they feel the need to charge $10 more a plate than say, Windsor or Federal Pizza.  If you're in to eating super clean or vegan, this is the place for you. Although, id rather go to Tru Foods if I'm trying to eat clean and vegan.  I just felt like their menu was very basic and lacked variety. There's nothing on their menu that is substantial while also costing less than $13. You can get like, 3 asparagus spears for like $9 though, if that's your thing.",

It has a beautiful outdoor patio and bar with a great relaxed but classy ambience. We came around 4:30 for happy hour and there was open seating at the outdoor bar. I was very impressed by the design of st. Francis! We tried 3/4 cocktails on happy hour: Santa Rosa, almond margarita, cucumber cooler which were $5 each. The Santa Rosa was delicious and was a fruity summer drink. The almond margarita did not taste as \"almond-y\" as expected, but had a hint of almond aftertaste. The cucumber cooler was a super refreshing outdoor drink! We had other plans for dinner, but I definitely want to come back for a dinner date here!",

    "text": "For the last several weeks, my girlfriend and I kept continuously debating on whether or not our first trip to St. Francis should be for dinner or brunch. The restaurant itself has been on our go-to list for quite some time now. As eager as I was to try their acclaimed skillet pancake, we reluctantly agreed to try them for dinner.  The setup of this restaurant is kind of what I expected. Small, hip, and lively to the point where some might find it to be frustratingly too loud to have an actual conversation. The food they specialize in is what's common in most modern-American restaurants, with the usual influences of Mexican, Italian, and Southern all being very apparent.  We made a reservation on a busy Saturday night and requested a booth, but were stuck with a table. Oh well. Servers were all very friendly and polite throughout the evening. Understandably slow, but that's not really the issue. The problem I have is that the food, although all looking and sounding great on paper, just doesn't really execute as well as we had hoped.  We started with the baked goat cheese, which comes with a variety of bread. The cheese itself was fine, but when combined with the tomato sauce, it comes off more like a soupy pasta sauce that is too runny to comfortably spread onto the bread. In the end, it's easier to eat by the spoonful, which I'm pretty sure was not their original intention. Additionally, we ordered their crispy fingerling potatoes. The flavor was decent, but strangely enough, only some of them were actually what I would classify as \"crispy.\" They might have been undercooked for all I know.   For entrees, I opted for the pork chili verde. I added the egg(s) for a three dollar up-charge and was asked if I wanted the avocado addition as well. I agreed, only to see that it was an additional two dollar up-charge. This would be fine, except for the fact that you're provided with two tiny slices that probably don't even make up a quarter's worth of an actual avocado. It was okay for a few bites but got dull very quickly. It was also more on the soupy side.  My girlfriend had the Moroccan meatballs. Honestly, we've had some pretty decent meatballs recently, but these definitely weren't in their realm. These were very dry, almost as if they were over-baked. This would be forgivable and still edible if it weren't for their strange sauce that uses some kind of nutmeg-ish spice. Sadly, this overpowers any balance and makes for a very distracting taste that hits you almost immediately.  Our bill was handed to us without inquiring about dessert, but thankfully, the server realized the mistake before it was too late. We ordered the buttercake. We're both huge fans of well-made buttercake, but this wasn't quite what we had hoped for. We appreciated the additions of the gelato and prickly pear caramel, but the cake itself was very dry and hard. The locally-made honeycomb on top was excellent to the point that we would have been better off just ordering a bunch of it and calling it a night.  We loaded our leftovers into plastic containers, which probably isn't the most ideal way to transport runny meatballs and chili verde. But at this point, I didn't really care, despite the leakage that inevitably occurred.  Honestly, St. Francis is a place that I really wanted to like. They're using all of the right ingredients from all of the right sources. But if you can't execute the food you're preparing on par with the prices you're asking, then I can't bring myself to give it anymore than a solid two stars.  In the end, we probably would have been better off visiting them during brunch hours.",

The new ownership's poor grammar and lengthy defensive responses to honest reviews just go to show what a mess this place now is. When people tell you what is really going on and you defend the disaster this place has become under your watch you need to open your eyes. The so called \"new chef based menu\" from a former chef of a low cost low performing restaurant down the street is junk, it's not what people have known to love and enjoy from the past 9 years of St Francis. Quality and local ingredients are an extinct breed of the former glory this gem once held to Phoenicians. The new general manager is absolutely a disgrace to the establishment.",

Two words...cauliflower steak.  You need this in your life.  It's flash fried and covered in yummy goodness.  In case you don't know what yummy goodness includes, it has golden raisins, capers, sun dried tomatoes, etc.  I could have made a meal out of this (shared it as an appetizer this visit) and then might have been able to have room for dessert.  For my entree I had the shrimp risotto.  Lots of great flavors, but I wish there were more than 4 shrimp.  Lots of risotto, too little toppings...in addition to a couple more shrimp, it could have used more spinach and olive tapenade.  Good flavors though.  Our server was great.  Very friendly and efficient.  She was able to describe how the cauliflower steak was prepared perfectly.  Not sure why they have valet only parking.  My car was parked right next to the valet stand, so I found it a bit ridiculous that they needed to park my car and pull it out.  It's free valet, but then there's the tip.

They don't have a lot of space, so they pack different pairs of people right next to each other. Given how expensive it is, my wife and I won't go there for a nice dinner, because it won't be nice when we're sitting two-and-a-half feet away from another couple.

Moroccan Meatballs, mushroom omelette, baked tomato eggs, etc...you can't go wrong with any of the choices here. The crusty bread is phenomenal and available for purchase at the bargain price of $4 a loaf.  If you come on a weekend, park at the bank next door to avoid the valet.  Wonderful atmosphere, welcoming for kids and groups. There is no bad seat in this wonderfully unique restaurant, however, try to score a table on the patio if the weather is nice.",

We ordered the baked goat cheese,which was delicious, as a starter.  We then ordered the cauliflower baked flatbread and the roasted chicken dish...both were recommended by the waiter. The flatbread was delicious, but the chicken was way undercooked...it looked beautiful...but as soon as we cut into it...red juices everywhere. It was nearly 10min before the waiter came to check on us...he took the chicken back....it was at least another 20min before i simply told the waiter to forget about the chicken.  He was nice enough to take it off our bill, but no offer for another dish or anything.  It will be some time before we try this place again.",

    "text": "From beginning to end, this place was a disaster. I can't believe a place with such a good reputation let me down so badly.   I had this place bookmarked for years so I suggested it as a meetup for my friends who live in north Phoenix. We ordered off the restaurant week menu which is actually not a good deal when you price out each individual component. About 20 minutes later, the hostess came up to tell us they were out of the okra app. If we had known how long our wait was going to be, I think we would have left at this point.  Thankfully, our company was wonderful because we didn't notice our appetizers hadn't come out after an hour had gone by. We finally had to flag down our waiter (who never checked up on us during that first hour) to ask about food for the 7 year old in our party. Most places know it's important to bring out the kids' food ASAP. Twenty minutes after that, our waiter came by to say he messed up on putting in our ticket so everything would come out at once.  A few of our appetizers came out, but mine never made it to the table. My husband said his ceviche was oddly sweet so he didn't eat much of it despite being very hungry at this point. He didn't like the pork belly posole either because the meat was pretty blah. I got the forbidden rice bowl which was ok, but it could have used a lot more veggies. My friend barely touched hers.  Dessert still took a long time to come out, and I was at my breaking point. I told the waiter to not bother and just get us the check. He brought out the desserts anyways. We call got the toffee pudding which was very dry. The gelato was the only redeeming factor.  When we got the bill, a bottle of wine that I first asked for but switched to another was still on the bill. My restaurant week meal was taken off, but I was still charged for my entree. Considering how bad our service was, I think they could have done better for us.  Between all of that plus only one functioning restroom and the valet bringing up our car to another couple, I will never come back to this place.",

    "text": "Everytime I come here I forget how expensive it is and the fact that is is a little overpriced for what you are getting.... I came here for a late brunch on a Saturday. I was seated right away, other than food coming out slow I have never had an issue with the service here. I just forgot that they have a salad that contains romaine lettuce, endive (isn't that just bitter lettuce?), apples, bacon and dressing for $12. Sorry but bacon bits with 2 other ingredients, does not a $12 salad make. If you want to add chicken, shrimp or salmon? $6, $7, $12.   I really wanted salmon but I just settled for an egg sandwich for $13, the principle of spending $24 on salmon for lunch was too heavy.  The egg sandwich had red peppers, avacado, bacon and a special yum sauce. It was tasty and cooked how I ordered it. One gripe was they did not peel the red peppers so the skin made it very chewy and kinda ruined the bite of the sandwich. If I roast and peel my own red peppers at home, I expect it to be done for a $13 sandwich. More to my point the sandwich was good, but nothing spectacular or original. I've had a better one at First Watch for $9. The food here is ok but definitely not upscale and nothing to wow about. As I was eating, an older gentleman eating nearby complained about his food, said he didn't like it. The waitress handled it well, but from what I gather on thier conversation, (tables are really close) he was especially unhappy about his expectation from what he was paying for vs what he got. I get it's expensive to do the fresh local thing  but food needs to be better, maybe they just need a menu update or put more creativity into it. Bottom line they need to step up the food or lower the price. Prices are upscale food is not.",

Bloody Mary's are always a must, as is the Biscuit's and gravy with Schreiner's sweet Italian sausage.   Lunch/Dinner: Seasonally, I love the pumpkin soup, and the \"pig dip\".

They have a nice selection of local beers and specialty drinks are only $5 during happy hour. If you are an architecture enthusiast, the interior of St Francis is amazing. They did a beautiful job of refurbishing this old brick walled building to its modern look today. Anywhere from the crisscross suspension cables to the paintings hanging on the wall that give it an art museum feel. St Francis is an urban neighborhood staple that sits right across from the foodie destination Uptown Plaza and the nearby Upward Projects restaurants down the street. They serve up fresh American wood-fired cuisine with an emphasis on simple flavors. I have yet to try their popular pig dip sandwich but the pork green chile with egg is to die for. I hear the bread is amazing too and has won some awards. The Sticky Toffee Pudding is a must try. St Francis has a great brunch menu on the weekends and I just recently had their iron skillet pancake. It's a nice throwback to my youth of cooking pancakes in a skillet during camping trips. The apples they use for the topping is caramelized in their wood fired oven and really adds to the flavors of this wonderful dish. St Francis is one of my favorite food destinations in the Valley and has been a wonderful addition to the Arizona food scene. Kids under 12 eat free during brunch. The Cafe at downtown Phoenix Public Market is a sister restaurant to St Francis.",

We came in sometime months back and noticed some of the menu had changed, I thought it was a seasonal change, the salad was terrible, I couldn't even eat it all, but we figured it was just a summer menu change. So we went in last week after many months of not visiting. The parking lot was always full on wknd eves, this time it wasn't. My order wasn't right, then sent back, then came back undercooked, the salad I got this time wasn't very good either and by that point I didn't want to order anything else. We were wondering what has happened, until I came on yelp and read reviews, had no idea they changed management, the food isn't the same at all. We had some fave dishes we always came here for, but they don't exsist anymore or are prepared differently. We wont be coming back as we were very disappointed and the price for the meal was way to expensive compared to what we were served, the quality and taste that was once the St. Francis we loved is gone. :(",

THE VISIT We live within walking distance and had never given this place a try.  Swing by one Sunday morning and its nice enough to sit outside. Our waiter is fantastic and welcomes us warmly.  He gives us a tour through the menu and his drink recommendations are on point.  We order brunch and my Eggs Benedict are truly remarkable.  I actually eat slowly just to savor each bite.  We also had a bread board that was phenomenal.  We leave with smiles on our faces, vowing to return very soon.  Score: 5/5  THE VISIT (The Sequel) It's Mother's Day!  We had such a wonderful first experience at St Francis that we want to share it with others.  We invite our Mom (and all my siblings and their kids) to brunch.  We are seated at the window booth near the entrance and have bread boards to go around.  Everyone loves their orders, including my picky mother.  However, my husband and I notice items that are over-cooked, under-cooked and dried out (breaks, ham, etc).  In addition, we really had to work to keep the attention of our server when she was needed.

It takes quite awhile to be acknowledged after we enter, even though the place is NOT busy.  Once greeted, we are still made to wait nearly 10 minutes before being seated.  Again...the VAST majority of tables are empty.  Our waitress spends a great deal of time chatting with different co-workers before taking our order.  She did not check back on us until flagged, even though our food was taking quite awhile AND we had asked that the children's food be sent out first.  They never got this message and it all came out at the same time.  Unfortunately, the girls got the wrong order (how do you mess up pancakes...?) and my pork chili was COOL....like, not hot...or warm...but ewww...borderline cold.  When I ask for a manager I am given the excuse that they are switching things out in the kitchen to ready for dinner service.  Not sure why that is an proper excuse for cold-ish food, incorrect orders, inattentive servers, etc.  We end up leaving with unhappy children and finished with our patronage at this restaurant.  Score  2/5  There are SO many fantastic restaurants in Uptown...no need to waste time and money at places that are so-so at best.  Unfortunately, for us, this place is not worth the effort.",

    "text": "Happy hour drink prices = AMAZING  Dinner was delicious. Had the baked goat cheese. This was SO good. How can you go wrong with goat cheese though....  Also ate the pork chile verde which was very good and truly the cornbread was some of the best I have had at a restaurant. Usually it is too dry or dense...this bread was light, fluffy, perfectly sweet/salty. My friend had the cauliflower soup and salad. Extremely tasty and satisfying and despite being so full from dinner, we had the cheesecake in a jar to top things off.   Atmosphere is definitely hipster and the building is just tucked away in the most random area in downtown Phoenix. Loved the decor and loved the openness of it all. I didn't necessarily like how loud it was inside. I don't think they can help that though.   Try it out!",

Drenched with berries and whipped cream and the cake itself was soft, but dense.  That said, not enough food for me by itself.  My friend ordered the American breakfast and gave it average reviews (the bacon was a little flimsy).  I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't attest to this one way or the other, but my girlfriend and friend both HATED the coffee.  They had a live jazz band which was cool, though I had to shout across the table for my friend to hear me.  The ambience of the place is still pretty cool, but the food still doesn't match the hype in my opinion.",

We had some delicious cocktails, the fingerling potatoes were amazing as always and dessert (sticky toffee pudding) is always a winner. We each ordered a different flat bread pizza and split them. She ordered the salmon which was amazing, I ordered the Mama's Meatzza which consists of prosciutto, sausage, bacon and, in my opinion the mistake, meatballs. I saw this on the menu and it sounded great, but what they fail to mention on the menu that its the same meatballs they use in their meatball entree - which uses Moroccan spices. Had I known that, I wouldn't have ordered it. I don't like thatflavoring on meats, especially when I don't expect it. It didn't go, it over powered everything else. I wouldn't order it again. I should have sent it back. If this was my first experience here, I would have given it 1 or 2 stars. Because I have been here many times, I would only take off one star, but I took off two for failing to mention the Moroccan spices on the menu description.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try St. Francis for quite some time now. My boyfriend took me out for date night here. Let me start off by saying, if you're going on a Friday night-MAKE RESERVATIONS. We ended up waiting 45 minutes..thankfully we had cocktails and an old black & white movie to keep us occupied in the outdoor \"waiting\" area..is that what it's supposed to be? I couldn't tell if you were allowed to order food from there or not.   The ambiance is upscale and trendy, with low lighting & a modern, chic interior-which I find to be typical of restaurants that are considered \"American New\".  I quite liked the design of this place.  Finally, after what felt like FOR-EV-ER, we were seated (really I was just hungry & being impatient so any amount of time felt like an eternity). We ordered the housemade baguette with olive oil & waters to start with. I realize that this place was busy but it seemed like it took quite a while to get said items. In fact, we got our bread and water at the same time the table next to us did, and they were seated who knows how long before we were. I felt a small pang of empathy, which was silenced by devouring of bread. My boyfriend and I both ordered the same thing under the Specialties-The Forbidden Rice bowl. Considering how much we love Forbidden Rice, our expectations were quite high. We again waited quite a while for our food to arrive. The food itself is 5 stars-the vegetables were so delicious and the rice was cooked to perfection. The dressing is to die for-a great combination of sweet and spicy.  Overall, my experience was \"good\" but not great. The slowness of service is what gives it a 3 star rating. I didn't expect to be at St. Francis for over 2 hours. I would return again, perhaps for brunch..or for dinner-but make reservations beforehand!",

This was a service station that's been converted to a cool eatery with an AWESOME patio and an indoor/outdoor bar, which I LOVE. I like sitting in the upstairs dinning area because it's a little more quiet. It reminds me of one of my favorite restaurants in Paris.  My favorite dish is the Prime Hanger Steak but the food is where I waiver on giving four stars. Presentation seems to supersede preparation so that your meals looks better than it actually tastes. That is not too say that the food here is bad because fresh quality ingredients are used and there are some very creative entrees on the menu so the food is far from bad.  I guess I just feel that compared to what's been done to create an awesome atmosphere for dining and drinking, the taste of the food falls a little short. I also don't feel that I get the most value for my money. The cocktails are great here but the drinks as well as the food are a bit on the pricey side. This is Phoenix after all, not Manhattan.  Still a good place to go though-if nothing else, bring a date here for a few cocktails on the patio because it will impress.",

The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!) is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date. The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items). It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items. One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan. As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what \"vegan\" meant. We ended up having to call a manager over.  The cocktail menu is so interesting it's hard to decide what to get. My favorite is the Dark and Stormy, which has ginger beer. *the BEST* cocktail around IMO. Do not pass up dessert. The bananas foster is amazing! Not traditional but good in and of its own.",

I was a little apprehensive the second time when it was suggested we come here for breakfast. I wasn't sure if the menu and price would work with my children. But I was mistaken. Kids 10 and under eat free and they absolutely loved having breakfast at St. Francis. Our server was super nice and very attentive to our party of 9. The cinnamon bun was HUGE and very scrumptious. Definitely will be coming back here!",

Our waitress was so sweet, the food was so good, the drinks were amazing, and the bill wasn't too bad at all! I started with a dirty gin martini, it was spot on.  We had the fingerling potato app, oh man the aoili and ketchup were so amazing with the potatoes.  The pork chili verde meal was very good, the corn bread made it for me, and the pork was cooked so well, tender as can be.  The meaty flat bread my Hubby had was bacon heaven, so tasty.

We started out with the goat cheese app (a recommendation from our awesome server Jose). My hubby is not a huge fan of goat cheese, but with the added ingredients mixed in (pesto, tomato) it was a hit! The menu has a wide variety of foods from brick oven baked pork chops to roasted salmon (which was phenomenal!). I left it up to Jose to choose the glass of wine. He made another great suggestion of the Burgans Albarino.   There were multiple items on the menu that appealed to both of us so we will definitely be back to try more!",

Went their for a nice dinner with to catch up with a girlfriend and can't wait to go back.    Their cocktails are done right.  You know anyplace that has a Dark and Stormy listed as a specialty cocktail knows a good drink, but I was still impressed.  The poor waiter at the table next to me was super polite and took my drink order right away since I was apparently way too excited to wait for my server to come.  (She totally came right away  and was great - I was just WAY over-zealous and excited for my Cucumber Cooler!)  The warm goat cheese is my new favorite cheesy dish. It is heaven in a crock dish.  A simple but elegant, creamy, silky heaven with a tomato surprise.  I'm typing this while stuffed, but would eat another entire portion by myself if someone put it in front of me right now. The pork chop is amazing. Make sure to split it though.  That way you can still have room to eat the apps, corn polenta, and seasonal veggie, all of which I couldn't stop eating.    The food is great, the atmosphere was cool, and the staff was fantastic.  I love waiters that love the food they serve and that are honest about what they like from the menu.    I will definitely be back to try even more menu items...and of course, more of that goat cheese!",

We were told that we had a 30 min wait max so we decided to wait.   We had to ask about our table and had to push the issue before we were seated.  Then it took about an hour before we were served our food.  Again,  we had to ask about our meals.  2 out of 3 meals were not served hot.  You could tell by the temperature that it had been sitting there awhile.  We sent the scallops back because it was not served fresh off the stove.  The next plate was hot and tasted good. We talked to the manager and he didn't seem very concerned.  The food was good but I don't want to spend over 2 hours to eat dinner on a Wednesday night.",

Start with their cucumber gin drink, and then order another.  Goat cheese on crostini follows.  Insist on extremely memorable whipped potatoes--a side order-- to accompany your salmon on red quinoa.  Dessert MUST be the chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato accompanied by carmel sauce trailings and carmel corn garnishes.  Try dining at the bar for an uncluttered view out the picture window opening, minus the glass.  Loved it!  Will happily return.  They split our entree for us AND were gracious about the extra trouble we caused--not a wimper.  Truly superior service !",

Decided to try the \"business lunch\" a trio that costs $18 and says that you will be out in 30 minutes.  I wasn't in any hurry so I didn't time it, but the food was quite prompt.  The first course was an asparagus salad.  It was about 5 stalks of asparagus topped with pine nuts, cheese, and some drizzle of sauce.  It was amazing.  I normally hate pine nuts but these added a great saltiness to the meal.  This alone was totally worth the trip.  The second course was a skirt steak with white bean hummus and spinach.  The steak was really good - perfectly cooked.  The spinach could have used a bit of sea salt to bring out more of the flavor and break up the simple taste.  The white bean hummus was freaking amazing.  Never thought anything that sounded so nasty could be so good.  Way impressed!  The final course was a bag of cookies.  An awesome lunch dessert.  There were two chocolate chip, three sugar, and 1 strange almond sandie type cookie.  Did not enjoy the last one but the others were great.  Wish I could go back more often but this place ain't cheap.  Still love it though!",

St. Francis remains a favorite brunch spot (great live music starts at 10:30am Sundays), and performs just as well for dinner.  The service is always on par and the food is consistently delicious.  Go for their breakfast sandwich, sans mayo-sauce (come on, quit being fancy - no matter what you call it, may doesn't belong on a breakfast sandwich).  Their flat bread pizzas and burgers are always a good call at dinner time.  Did I mention happy hour?  The bar scene here is small, but if you can grab one of the outdoor stools, you'll be happy for quite some time.",

The pinot (which was recommended by the server and the most expensive of the pinots) was not great.  I definitely have had better wines for less money.  Most people enjoyed their foods.  The veggie rice bowl was delicious.  The specialty pizza was yummy.  The salmon was great.  I had pumpkin soup, which was tasty but the toasted pomegranate seeds on the top were a little odd.  Not sure that I enjoyed the flavor.  I also ordered seasonal veggies, which roasted cauliflower and red beets (maybe?).  It was not good.  However, my friend ate it and seemed to enjoy it. Perhaps I was having an off night.  I like this place and will try it again, but I was expecting more.",

    "text": "The Dinner Club pick for January was St. Francis - the new CenPho hot spot.  Parking: there really isn't much. We were the last car into the lot before the valet shut down the lot with cones. Not sure where those people trying to get in after us ended up parking...but be warned, parking is an issue, especially on Fri and Sat nights.  Food: the consensus - very good.   Starters/Soup: We started with the baked goat cheese, which was good, and there was enough for all 8 people to have a few bites. One of us ordered the cream of celery soup, which was a hit, delicious, warm, flavorful, creamy...yummmm.   Main Course: The main courses were all very well received with the exception of the green chili pork...lacked flavor, and even worse, lacked heat!! The cornbread served along side was also on the dry side. The other questionable entree was the flatbread...which could be delicious but it was covered with very salty kalamata olives (and I love kalamata olives) but there were waaaaay too many. It completely overwhelmed the rest of the toppings. However with a little less olives I have no doubt it would be delicious. Winners were the roasted chicken, and the pot roast sandwhich (fantastic), we will be back for the pot roast sandwich  Dessert: we had 2, they were tasty, but nothing special, and we left a few bites on the table (since I make a rule to never, ever leave a desset behind this either spoke to how full I was or the lack-luster nature of the dessert, I havent decided which).   Other factors: service: mostly good. only problem was no spoon delivered with the soup and it took about 5-6 min to track down a server to fetch one, however once the food runner realized he had forgotten the spoon, he was very apologetic and offered to get me a new bowl...which wasn't necessary, but the gesture was appreciated.  Drinks: nice mixed drink selection  Overall: good restaurant made better by the ambiance and the fact that its about 5 min from all of our hourses...  DC score = 4 stars",

The Warm sticky pudding with sweet cream gelato Desert.

The baked goat cheese and the mushroom risotto were so well made and perfectly cooked. The heirloom green salad was as chic and warm as the interiors of the place. The place had an urban, rustic feel and the theme carried on to the drinks and food. The server seemed genuinely a fan of the food and her suggestions were great. She took time to explain to us the history of the place and the chef.",

    "text": "The Mrs. and I had never been here yet. Her boss was in town and we needed a place to take her for dinner before she caught her flight home. Now normally, we don't like to take someone somewhere we haven't been, but her boss had heard about St. Francis and wanted to go.  Here's another, \"I really wanted to like this place, but...\" review. I thought the food was good. Very tasty and decent portion sizes. However, for what you get, I thought it was a bit overpriced. We enjoyed our dinner at a quiet table upstairs, but since her flight wasn't until almost midnight, we decided to hang out for awhile and enjoy a few beverages and catch up. Everything was great until they decided to close the upstairs around 10 PM and they sent our waitress home form the evening. The waiter who took our order was a little snooty and appeared to have other places he'd rather be. Drink refills were few and far between and we thought they were trying to close up. I excused myself to use the men's room and when I went downstairs I was surprised to see the downstairs was still very busy. I'm the waiter would have rather not have had to cover both the upstairs and the downstairs, but we were courteous and tipped well. I'm sure we'll go back and try them again. I really like the ambiance of the patio. It seemed like a great place to enjoy dinner and drinks on a beautiful evening.",

We passed the time nicely.  Food was really good, the service was pretty cool - with a very casual vibe thrown in - and one of the chefs actually brought out our dinner because my girlfriend wanted to know how they incorporated celery root into their soup. Our server brought out an envelope with the recipe and quietly slipped it to her, which was followed up by a visit from one of the chefs and a discussion about how to cook with celery root properly.   This really pushed St. Francis into a major thumbs-up: when chefs and restaurants aren't afraid to share knowledge and talk with customers about techniques, they win in our book.  Go there - you'll enjoy it.",

    "text": "I've been to St. Francis before, and the food was delicious. However my recent experience was extremely disappointing. The hostess had us wait 25 minutes to sit (even though there was a ton of open seating) because the kitchen was apparently backed up.   When we were seated, THREE other parties who came in AFTER us had already ordered and received drinks. When our waitress finally returned, we put in our order as the people who arrived after us were being served their food.   I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend got the Egg Sandwich. Mine was served on sour dough (they clearly ran out of English muffins), there was barely any hollandaise sauce, and the meat was rubbery. There was no flavor, and the potatoes (which are normally awesome) were so bland. My boyfriend's sandwich came out sopping and soggy, and was also flavorless.    Our waitress took 10 minutes to come back for a refill. After everything was said and done, I felt ripped off. Definitely not worth the 53$ bill.",

We got a great table outside, water and silver provided quickly, and then we sat. A considerable time later a waiter came by and we placed our order.  Rather than bring our coffee she took orders from two additional tables before even getting coffee served. Our group tried several dishes. None memorable and one even returned the tomato eggs as it was not very good. After prompting we did get a birthday desert ( clearly they never read the comments on the reservation). In summary, just ok food, poor service, dirty coffee cups but good jazz. I think we will stick w brunch at Chelsea's Kitchen!",

Add an egg on top, and you've got a fiesta on your plate that you'll devour faster than you can say its name! So good!

I was pleased to be recommended the kale salad with quinoa. I was unsure if I would like it but I loved it. I got it with steak. The dressing is light and flavorful. The server brought me out a extra side of dressing just in case but it didn't need it. The kitchen tossed it well. The plus were the appetizer with the deviled eggs. I'm not even an egg person and loved these. Top all of this with their bottomless mimosas made my day! I can't wait to come back.",

Since my first review, myself and my friends and family have made this place our go-to Sunday brunch spot!! And for good reason. A jazz band playing inside, amazing food, great service and a diverse clientele. I have brought so many friends here it's insane I feel like St Francis' marketing staff. lol. This place stands up to some of the brunch spots in NYC without a doubt. Seriously.  Thanks to everyone there for running an amazing Phoenix restaurant!",

    "text": "While I was looking for a very nice experience this just wasn't.  The fly fan above the outside bar is aimed low so that it blows directly in your face and you can't comfortably sit at the outside bar. I had to move inside as did 3 other  parties who arrived while I was there. Another party was smart enough to leave and go elsewhere. Who wants to sit inside on a nice cool Fall day in Phoenix?  I ordered a cup of pumpkin $4 soup, $12 fingerling potatoes as an app, a nice glass of $11 wine and $18 Shrimp Risotto as my entree.  Soup arrives in about 5 minutes and 30 seconds later fingerlings arrive. What's the rush.  2 minutes later here comes my $18 Risotto- I haven't even tasted my soup yet. What's the rush??? What recipe are they using!?!? Risotto takes at minimum 18-20 minutes to prepare.  The soup was fine. The potatoes were fine.   The Risotto was horrible. A little bit of Crunchy rice in a wet gooey sauce that reminded me of canned spaghettios with parsley and cilantro thrown on top for a \"salad\". No Parmesan,  The shrimp was obviously thrown into the pan to heat it up - unseasoned a few seconds before they threw it on the plate.   Dessert- Sticky Toffee Pudding- took 25 minutes to arrive after ordering. I thought well ok... they're baking a fresh batch. No no no. It was cold, dry (stale). They didn't event bother to warm up the sauce!  The ice cream was good.   Lastly the menu clearly states Happy Hour is 3-6PM EVERY DAY \"FOOD $3 OFF\". My check was only discounted for the fingerlings and the glass of wine when it should have been every item   I'd ordered.",

Overall the food and the concept of the restaurant is decent.  Prices are a bit high for certain items  Service is what should really be worked on   We came because of seeing it on the Diners, Drive Ins, and Dive show  But I would've hoped it would have met my expectations and would focus more on customer service",

They offer indoor and outdoor tables which allow you to enjoy both the great winter and spring Phoenix weather while also giving some needed cover during those hot summer days (and nights).   We enjoyed the Eggs Benedict. It was really good!!!! Order it with the salmon. Hollandiase sauce was one of the best i've tried.  We also ordered The French Onion burger. It was just OK. I ordered it to be cooked medium, but it was served well done instead. It came out a little dry for my taste. The fried onion and argula were great.  Let's see what the pancakes would be like...  Waiting for the pancake for 15mins now...  Food was served fast earlier...  Ok, Let's do a follow-up on my pancake...  Looks like they forgot our order =(  Manager went out to speak to us about the delay. He did apologize for the delay and informed us that they are preparing our pancake and it is off the bill. Good! nope... GREAT!!!!!  Pancake? It's worth the wait! The crispy edges from cooking it on hot iron skillet and brick oven mixed with caramelized apples and dark chocolate was really really good.   Will I come back? Yes! In a heartbeat! I do have some recommendations.. Menu is confusing. They have a different menu for sundays and saturdays as compared to weekdays, different menu after 3pm, and a different menu after 5pm.

Honestly, I haven't been back in a long time so I decided to go again, but for a casual dinner this time.  I ordered the baked goat cheese and the roasted chicken.  I love goat cheese so I am kind of picky.  The goat cheese was not what I expected at all- in a bad way.  The roasted chicken was flavorful.  Both items were not big portions and there wasn't anything left to take home.  Usually, I always leave with a doggy bag.  The patio is a cute patio, but quite small. I highly recommend it during nice weather.  We were seated next to an obnoxious couple with a female who had way too much to drink.  I practically heard every word and laugh she made, which was quite distracting.  There is valet parking so make sure you have some cash with you to tip the valet attendant.    In terms of value, I am not sure if this makes it to the top of my list due to $$ and portion size.",

I ordered the \"American Breakfast\" which is a couple strips of bacon, eggs, potatoes and toast. First off, it is $12 and the amount of food is on the slight side. The bacon is despicable. It is thin, sort of like the precooked bacon you get from the grocery store or bacon you'd expect on a junior bacon cheeseburger from Wendy's. Seems like you get 2 or 3 eggs but the potatoes you get is a small handful. My wife got the chorizo scramble. She said it was good but again, small portion. You get much better breakfast food from a True diner for much less money. Not talking chain diner but a ma' and pa' diner. So my suggestion would be to order off their lunch menu if you are looking for cost to quality ratio.",

First, I really like the relaxed atmosphere and modern design that greets you upon arrival.  Attractive indoor-outdoor bar seating lines the front of the restaurant and when you enter, you see an open kitchen with fresh breads on display.  Upstairs and downstairs seating are both cool.  For lunch, the Arizona Grain Salad was delicious and a perfect meal during the work day.  Wheat berry, purple barley, cucumbers, mixed greens, walnuts and a citrus vinaigrette covered this amazing dish. On my next visit, I ordered the Pork Chop which was a dinner specialty.  Wow!  It was incredibly moist, flavorful and full of crushed chestnuts, bacon, cabbage, sauerkraut and whole grain mustard jus.  Desserts are also really well done.  St. Francis is indeed one of my favorite places to dine in Phoenix.  It spruces up Camelback Road and it's versatility makes it the perfect place for business, meeting friends, after work specialty cocktails or just a romantic evening.",

We both ordered the steak med rare and we both ate every bite! I couldn't stop eating it was that good!!! Since it was his birthday they brought us a piece of chocolate cake which we ate with a cup of coffee- the chocolate cake was so good!

That is not quiet acceptable.   - The food was less than excellent. Again, maybe I held you to a higher standard, maybe its my fault, it normally is in my house ... It might have been the seasonal menu change, it might have been the service that set the tone for the rest of the day.

Got to the restaurant and there was complimentary valet service, I parked in the Bank of America lot next door because I don't need someone to valet my car when I only have to walk 7 feet to the restaurant.  The restaurant is really nice inside, everything seemed clean. We were seated upstairs, I hate long booths with tables right next to each other, reminded me of why I hated most NYC restaurants.  We got the goat cheese appetizer which was the highlight of the meal for everyone. I got a burger with onion rings on it, I would give the a 3 out of 5 stars, if I returned I would probably get something else. I'm surprised they don't have a burger with an egg on the top, seems like the perfect place for that. I saw someone else on here say the onion burger was the best burger they've had, the bun was good, everything else seemed average to above average. This is coming from a guy who went on a burger tour when I used to live in NYC. I would return but there are other places I plan on going first before I do.",

The hostess was sweet and sent me to the right table and etc.  The valet was even exceptionally friendly.    We had Monique as our server.  She was very pleasant.

The Baker's board was a great start and showed the range and sensible attention to basic details offered by the kitchen.   The St Francis Bloody Mary, apparently voted best of Phoenix, was carefully crafted from at least eight different ingredients. While I enjoyed the veggie base, the flavor profile is distinctly citric. Unfortunately, I am more of a fan of salt and pepper, so next time I am going to have to pass on what otherwise was a great cocktail.   The Cucumber Cooler was refreshing and tasty. Anything with Hendricks does a body good.  I highly recommend the fried egg sandwich. Bacon + spice + mozzarella + red peppers = yum.   The wood-oven baked eggs was the wow offering on the menu. Baked eggs and braised beef plus broccolini and tomatoes with bread is a rich and filling plate with a taste you'll want to visit again soon.   On a busy day, a couple may be able to get away with finding a great seat at the bar. However, if you're you're coming in a group, it might be worth calling ahead.",

They have a decent bar, and they carry Chopin vodka, which is a plus.  Get a martini, have some dinner, enjoy.  As far as service is concerned, don't be too picky.  They are more interested in \"pretty\" than experience as far as I can tell.  That's fine, just enjoy the pretty and don't expect loads of professionalism or food knowledge from the college students working there.  Despite the service snafus, I always take out of town guests to St. Francis.  The menu is interesting and there's something for everybody.  I encourage you to give it a try!",

I've heard good things about this place so a holiday mixer was a perfect reason to stop in. When I entered I immediately noticed the indoor/outdoor bar area and thought it would be a great place to grab drinks on a sunny afternoon.   My party had reserved the upstairs loft portion for our mixer and I was very impressed about how \"urban\" and \"hip\" yet layed back this place felt. Since I missed happy hour I ordered a glass of Merlot ($10) and snacked on their fingerling potatoes ($6)...mmmmm they were delicious and very addicting. Since it was raining I opted for the pumpkin soup ($6) which was topped with creme fraiche (fancy word for sour cream), croutons and pomegranate seeds. It was creamy, tangy and delish, I almost ordered another bowl. I will def. be back for their jazz brunch or dinner!   Overall   Great service  Comp valet  A bit hard to find if your flying down Camelback  Quality food",

    "text": "In town on business and went here for lunch. FINALLY!! A decent place to have lunch in Phoenix! I am supposed to visit more often but a one day trip from LA to HOT HOT HOT Phoenix is exhausting. I make it out about twice a year. Every lunch I have had has been horrible until St. Francis.  The decor is rustic chic with lovely brick walls, open floor plan which shows kitchen and well thought out architecture.   We ordered the Baked Goat Cheese appetizer and it was VERY good. I think the bread pieces could have been a little softer but overall 4 stars for me.   Next came the craziest sandwich I have ever had. (I don't know if they sell it because I can't find it online...) It was open faced, had some sort of potato salad and large pieces of bacon on top. OMG. Probably the most unhealthy thing I have ordered in a long time but DAMN it was good!!! It comes with Red Quinoa, french fries or chips. I got the quinoa which was the best part of the meal. (Finally something healthy!) I was able to sample the chips though and they were SOO good! I wish I had done half and half.   This is a great option for classy decor, hot waitresses and good food. I highly recommend.   mmm... One last thing. I am obsessed with high quality salt. They seem to be using it here. It makes everything SO GOOD!",

    "text": "Definitely a booji restaurant!  I had dinner plans with my friends,  two of whom are priests, so how appropriate it would be to have dinner at St. Francis!!! =) Of course I don't know much about the history of this restaurant but just the name itself is enough.  I like the setting of the restaurant- contemporary designs.  The food is mediocre.  My best compliment go towards the flatbreads- I must say if really delicious and pricey pizza change it's name, it would be flatbreads at St. Francis.  It was delish!  I got the Seafood Cioppino and so did my friend.  It has enough amount of shrimp, clams, mussels, white fish and a big piece of bread with melted cheese in the middle.  The tomato broth was well season with all kinds of herb which I really like but it was so salty.  The bread was not enjoyable because it has too much cheese and it was way too soggy from the tomato broth.  Tomato and melted cheese and bread do not go together.  I think the recipe can do without the melted cheese.  The mussels, clams, white fish were excellent and nicely blend into the sauce.  For $25, I wish there were more mussels!!!!  My other friend had the Roasted Salmon \"Superfood\" and he said it was just ok.   Not much to say about this dish, just the fact that the display was pretty nice.  My other friend ordered the French Onion Burger, she said it was pretty good.  How can any restaurant go wrong with a burger right?  I had a glass of Riesling- it is superb so I must give a thumb up to whoever chose the Schloss Vollrads Riesling!!! excellent!  I had an excellent waitress- I believe her name is CJ.  Always smiling!  She's a pretty lady!  and ladies- the bartender is a cutie!!!! ;)",

    "text": "It's so easy to pass by this place at 40-miles-an-hour down Camelback  Road and not even know it's there. Please slow down and take note--it's a VERY cool spot.  We walked over with a couple of friends and, though it was a Tuesday night, the place was packed.  Without a reservation, we opted to eat out on the patio instead of waiting the 30-45 minutes quoted to get a notably warmer table inside.  On a very chilly evening, the dramatic outdoor fireplace, though purely aesthetic from our distance, provided an artful glow and some psychological comfort from the cold.  The patio was beautifully appointed in a \"chic-yet-casual\" sort-of motif.  I really appreciated the fact that the boundaries between the interior and the exterior of the restaurant were rather understated and transparent.  This layout made us feel much less like we were \"banished\" to the patio because of our lack of reservations.  Our server was friendly, attentive and enjoyable and had a very good working knowledge of the menu and, most importantly, his recommendations coming from the kitchen that evening.  With St. Francis being known for its wood-burning oven, I opted for the roasted chicken.  It was the ideal blend of contemporary presentation and traditional comfort food and perfectly fit my mood on this early winter's evening.  I truly enjoyed every bite.  Next time I'll know to make an advanced reservation.  I am very curious to dine in the very cool looking upstairs area that I noticed upon entering.",

    "text": "The Husband and I have had our eyes on St Francis for a couple of months now, and finally made it over for our anniversary dinner.  Another amazing Central Phoenix repurposing project gone amazingly well - bravo!  It is just gorgeous inside.  I loved everything from the open kitchen design to the outdoor lounge; the collection of cookbooks along the wall to the open air bar.  Perfection!  We decided to sit at the very front bar, so I could spy on the kitchen and take a look at all of the offerings coming out (plus, I wanted to make sure we got the well-priced $5 cocktails for happy hour).  I began with the Meyer Lemonade-vodka concoction, and the Husband tried his luck with the almond margarita.  The almondy-twist on a traditional margarita was surprisingly good.  Definitely something I would order in the future.  The lemonade was light and bright, but possibly too boring for my taste.  For round two, the Husband tried the Dark and Stormy.  He seemed to enjoy it, but I thought it was a bit heavy on the ginger for my liking.  Our waitress seemed a little out of practice.  She failed to mention the dinner specials until we had finished both drinks, placed our appetizer order, and already decided on our meal choice.  Strange.  Then, she seemed to disappear for much of the time, and we were taken care of by a much friendlier and knowledgeable waitress, only to have her reappear at the end of the meal.  We had a lovely time chatting with the chef who was in charge of the brick oven.  He helped us to decide which flatbread to order (we went with the bacon/onion marmalade/arugula), and we were SO pleasantly surprised when he then served us a half portion of the other flatbread as well!  What amazing service.  And, for the record, I actually liked the second flatbread even better than the first!  We ordered the green-chili pork stew with a side of polenta.  The stew was truly fantastic.  The pork was so tender and it was the perfect level of heat for my palate.  The accompanying cornbread was divine!  I wish that we had been given an entire cake!  We were painfully full by this point, so we had to forgo dessert... however we will definitely return to work our way through the rest of the menu!",

    "text": "To start off... BOOOO!!!  I called in and made an 8pm reservation for 3 people. My daughter and I were meeting my husband up there, we were in separate cars so the arrival was going to be staggered by approx. 10 minutes. I checked us in for our reservation at 7:48pm at the hostess stand and the hostess said they would seat us when my husband arrived. My 3yr old daughter and I had to wait outside. This was no big deal as we were about 10 minutes early anyways. I did however express that I would like to put in my daughters order asap so the sooner they could seat us, even if my husband had not yet arrived, the better. She needed to eat and I would have liked a starter and a drink while we waited for my husband to join us. Any how, we waited until he arrived at 8:00pm and I was given a choice of two four top tables, one was upstairs and one was down stairs. I chose the upstairs table for convenience as I have a little one and it was a bit quieter up there.  They sat us at our table, gave us our menus and left us to choose our starters, drinks etc.... Who I thought was the waitress, thinking my order was going to be taken, ends up being the hostess who returns about 5 minutes later and proceeds to ask us to move to a 2 top that is right next to the table we had been seated at. As there is 3 of us I was a bit confused, she said there had been a goof up and that the table we were seated at was reserved for a party of 4 that had not yet arrived but would be coming in in the next 10 minutes. I'm pretty taken back by the situation as I had an 8pm reservation for 3 people and was already seated. She then started saying that I only had a reservation for 2. I  asked her to check the reservation book as it should clearly show that I called and made a reservation for 3 at 8 pm. She said rudely that I had done some sort of  web check in for 2 and never even went down to check the reservation book.   At this point I'm just baffled at how someone could be arguing with me about something like this as they had already seated us and did not seem to have this issue when I arrived or when they seated us. So she is still asking us to move to a 2 top when we are still clearly 3 of us. Then she says we would have to wait for another table unless we moved to the 2 top. I then asked her again if she would go back and check the reservation book. At this point I was still willing to over look the weird situation at hand but was not willing to be moved to a less than accommodating table. The other hostess then returns and goes thru the whole thing all over again making us feel just awful, my head was spinning and the situation became awkward and even more so uncomfortable. Finally after the rude, disrespectful and aggressive treatment I asked the young lady if she would like us to leave so the other party could be seated when they arrived. I think she finally realized how nonsensical they were being and snidely said no that's OK, but I hope you enjoy your dinner and huffed off.   My husband and I had had it and decided to leave. No restaurant has that great of  food that any one should ever just accept this kind of treatment. I looked around and there were a few other empty 4 top tables that we could have either been moved to or that they could have placed the other \"non present\" party at. No matter how good the food might have been, the meal we never got to order was already ruined. We have heard mixed reviews regarding the food here but wanted to give it a try any ways. Bad Idea.  We live in the area and regularly frequent many of the restaurants in the neighborhood and have never, I mean never been treated with such disrespect and horrible unforgivable customer service. I can not even begin to describe how disrespected and demoralized we felt. So on our way out we let the manager know that we would not be staying and that they could take their table and give it to whom ever they wished.  We were walking to our car and this lady is chasing after us trying to apologizing for the mishap. We were clearly really upset and unhappy with this awful situation. I told her that it was a little too little too late and I let her know we did not wish to have a conversation regarding the situation. She insisted that we talk with her and she would not stop trying to speak with my husband, I finally had to ask her to leave us alone. I mean really, we are not happy, we left and are completely disgusted at what had occurred and she continues to ramble on like it is going to change what had just taken place.  All I can say is what happened to customer service?? And just because a restaurant is busy at the moment and appears to be doing well it does not mean that their employees can treat their patrons with such blatant disrespect. I have seen a lot of restaurants come and go over the years around here, some have had really good food, some not, but not at any time have we ever encountered this kind of treatment.  We will not be returning here.",

    "text": "My first visit to @StFrancisPHX was part of the @FoodiesLikeUs Light Rail Dine Around (#PHXLRDA).  There was about 20 or so in our group, including wheelchair-bound attendees.  My initial impression wasn't a great one, as I got the impression that finding seating for us all, together, was more a chore for them, than doing business. It was later explained to me that our group inadvertently caused the problem.  Once we were seated, they brought out some bread, and oil. The bread was tasty, but there was maybe 8 oz of oil, for 20+ people.  On the recommendation of some people I trust, I ordered the Chile Verde.  It did not disappoint! Served in a mini iron skillet, with a nice chile right on top, and a couple wedges of corn bread, the meal was fantastic.  The chile had a very noticeable \"bulkiness\" to it, that I look for in good chile. Plenty of meat, and plenty of burn, without trying to permanently destroy taste buds.  The corn bread was a tad dry, which made it a bit too crumbly and fragile for really getting into dipping, but it was delicious, and soaked up the flavor quite nicely.  As this was our second stop, and I (stupidly) had over-indulged at our first location, AND we still had dessert to obtain, I was unable to finish my meal. But St. Francis has great little togo containers, so I now have lunch for tomorrow!  As a chef, I appreciated, and enjoyed, the open style kitchen. It's always a pleasure to observe people when they cook, but considerably more so when I know the food could be/is my own dish.  Overall, I had a good experience. I would certainly love to return, and fully intend on doing so, especially when the weather cools a bit, so I can enjoy the patio. I would also love to have the window seat upstairs.",

    "text": "I hate the word \"stew\". It's right up there with slacks, moist and congealed. That said, St Francis' Pork Chile Verde ( I refuse to call it Stew...*cringe*) was phenomenal. Wow... just wow. I think I said that I wanted to roll around naked in it. It was that good.   This was my second visit to St Francis, the first visit was wine only. I doubt I'll ever be back without dining again. I'm dying to try the Baked Goat Cheese appetizer..(let's add goat cheese to that list of words I can't stand) and though I'm not a huge fan of sweets, the Chocolate Cake sounds insane. Get this: peanut butter gelato, caramel sauce, homemade caramel corn. Really?......no, really?.... If that doesn't make you need to change your panties (oh great, another word for the list....ewww) nothing will.   I'm fully smitten with their patio. We gnawed relentlessly on some french bread and olive oil. I would love to see more places replace butter with olive oil or at least have the option. It's a petty thing but with everyone being so health conscious it just makes sense and it's tasty.  I can't wait to go back in full on fatty mode and gorge (where are all of these disgusting words coming from) like the closeted fat kid that I am. I'm pretty sure this rating will go up to 5 stars after my next visit.",

    "text": "It's been about a month or so since I've been to St. Francis, but I cannot stop thinking about the amazing experience I had there!  I crave their food almost every day.  I went around the time that happy hour was starting, and I was so impressed with all the great options at such great prices. There were 4 of us and this is what we ordered to share: baked goat cheese: I'm a sucker for anything containing melty cheese and especially goat cheese so naturally I thought this was amazing corn soup: I was a little unsure if I should have ordered this, but I was so happy I did. It was SO delicious! fingerling potatoes: A pretty standard item, but they were nice a flavorful and came with a couple dipping sauces.  pork chile verde: I personally did not try this dish since I'm a vegetarian, but from everyone else's reactions I can conclude that it was as equally yummy as everything else. forbidden rice bowl: To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this dish, but it really surprised me! Instead of boring white or brown rice, the dish is make with black rice and has pleasantly different texture that what you're used to. The veggies were super fresh and flavorful.  Our server was a very polite lady who helped us pick everything that we ordered. She was the one who suggested that I should indeed order the corn soup and I'm so glad I listened to her advice!  I also think the atmosphere of the restaurant should be noted. The place wasn't too bustling, probably because it was a week day and only around 4:30 in the afternoon, but the place still had a good vibe. Also the interior is modern without being too cold.   Overall, in just one meal, the place has pushed itself high up on my list of favorite restaurants. Give it a try!",

Totally makes you feel like you're not in Phoenix inside. Beautiful persimmons, pomegranates and freshly baked bread adorn the kitchen line. We got a specialty house cocktail and a glass of wine at the bar. Bartender was very professional, attentive and polite. We were seated at a table right in the middle of the room which in some places could be noisy or chaotic but the vibe in there is great. There's this lovely calm and the small dining room absorbs sound well. They have an awesome team thing going on there--no yelling from the kitchen--all the staff seems pleasant, warm and looks like they're enjoying being there. Totally changes your dining experience when it seems like all the staff is calm and smiling. So many restaurants have such a bustle but this place just has this poised productive demeanor even with a full house. We were served by Christie (Kristy? Sp?) and she was imperturbable and regardful, the ideal server:) Our meal was so fresh and so unique. Had the shrimp risotto and hangar steak. Nothing ostentatious or silly, just beautiful plates that tasted like they were crafted with care. I'll definitely be back and be bringing my friends!",

    "text": "St Francis is definitely the newest hottest place in Central Phoenix.  Another restaurant renovated from an older building, which seems to be a trend in Phoenix.  Somehow the old is revived again to make it more appealing and cool again.  I guess it's just like how trends come and go, then get recycled back into society as years past.  So with all that said you could guess that St. Francis looks quite exciting on the inside and out.  Just because the outside looks sleek and the decor gleems coolness doesn't always make a restaurant top notch though.  The food here is outstanding with fresh products made into delights of joy.  The chef is very creative with all the dishes and it shows.  No wonder every time I've been here the place has been busy.   Doesn't even matter if it's a Tuesday night, people will be here.  My only complaint about this place, which is a minor one for me, I wish they had a better happy hour that included some of their food.  The drink prices are great, but if you're looking for a deal on food this is not a place to come for happy hour.",

Some of the seats do not have back support, unless someone is sitting behind you, likely a stranger. That is weird! When I made mention of it, the server just looked at me and said that's how these seat are. So, can I please get other seats??? Someone else in my group switched me and I notice him slouching throughout the meal... sorry friend.   The meal: Each dish was very nicely presented and tasted good. BUT, everything was served in rations that were very very small. Lunch consisted of 4 oz soup, half of a veg sandwich and a small hand full of tasty salad. So I was quite hungry after this lunch, which ended up costing a small fortune. BTW, the soup tasted good but someone decided it would be a fancy idea to put pomegranate seeds in it - BIG mistake. Drop the clashing seeds please.   Atmosphere is very interesting. I like the open air feeling, and the cute decor. I didn't care for the flies, but I think that is the trade-off.   I am not looking for huge portions, but I don't want to pay a ton and leave hungry. I am not looking for opulent luxury, but do want to sit comfortably.   I think this place has some real gaps in the experience it provides. I think St. Fran would benefit from a slightly more mature staff.",

The cinnamon roll is to live for! Share it with a friend or be like me and eat the entire thing yourself- sugar belly!  The cocktails are great too, the bloody mary is savory and comes with all kinds of goodies - can be too spicy for me sometimes but I just pop an antacid and all is good.   Dinner this past weekend was just as great.  We were a large party but Francis was a saint and our table was ready on time without any delays.  Our server was also timely and most accommodating by not batting an eye at our request for separate checks. He made it seem like a fairly easy process even after we decided to play musical chairs, which would have burned my biscuits if I was in his shoes, for him, not a problem whatsoever.  I decided on the meatball dish and man were those balls meaty and the Moroccan spiced sauce was delicious. The dish comes with three hefty balls, saucy sauce, pearl pasta and I added the hen egg because it was an option at no cost.  I want to try the pork chop next. A friend suggested I do so. Every element about this place is great, the architecture, interior decor (rustically romantic), lighting, valet service and patio. All the elements that imo make for a great dinning experience.",

Starving we opted for an app of baked goat cheese with tomatoes & were happy we did so.  Our table came up faster then the 30 minute wait but we opted to sit at the bar since we were comfy.  Becuase I can't do an app & my own entree (pansey I know) we were down to one entree. We opted to share the french onion burger. We ordered it medium rare & on a very busy Saturday evening it came to me medium rare. The Gods in the kitchen smiled on me & broght their A game. This meaty deliciousness aka burger has smoked bacon & gruyere cheese with fries. The ketchup was doctored or maybe made onsite. It was so good I'm hoping it was prepared onsite. It was very smokey with a hint of spice & great with the fries. Me saying the ketchup is good is saying a lot considering I don't do ketchup at all. It was a nice surprise. The experience was good & I will definitely be back for the roasted chicken & take the table offered just for fun.",

For food I started with basics: standard American breakfast subbing avocado for the bacon. The service was slow  and the coffee lukewarm, and this was followed up with over salted eggs and a completely unripe avocado. I understand that we are not in California, but just tell the customer the avocados aren't ripe yet. Hopefully it just a bad day, but there is no compelling reason to come back if you can't do the basics.",

I have never had any item that I did not enjoy, in fact I have a new appreciation for fresh ingredients after having the pleasure of dining here.  Chef Aaron can be compared to Picasso with a brush, or even Stephen King with a pen, except he perfects his ideas with kitchen utensils putting his work on plates.  Alex, Korbi and David serve great drinks.  Kayla and Dylan have both served us and are always attentive to their tables.  Brunch is excellent, I would recommend the Egg Sandwich or Eggs Benedict, and you can't go wrong with any of the baked goods.  Happy hour is fantastic, very good deals.  For lunch I would recommend the French Onion Burger, always cooked to what you order and one of the tastiest burgers I have had in the Valley.  The menu is seasonal so don't be afraid to try something new.  During your wait enjoy the building, the lines are amazing, and there is a mural from local artist Dose on the second floor.  Thank you St. Francis.",

The pot roast was rich, over creamy polenta with a great sauteed spinach.   We finished with their apple crumble, which was flaky cinnamony deliciousness.   By far our best meal in Phoenix",

We met up with Chef Aaron Chamberlein, and let him know we were here. Taking a quick tour of the restaurant which we saw last time in Phoenix last year during construction. Aaron's brother, David, is the general manger and he joined us for dinner.  We had all the appetizers, and I really liked them all. Go ahead and order the Romaine Salad as well as the Risotto for starters. Don't forget the Baked Goat Cheese the next time you come here to eat.  I ordered the Roasted Chicken with mashed potatoes and enjoyed it a lot. With our group, the Seafood Cioppino was a real hit.  We were sitting for dinner in the new patio, and the fireplace was lit. Nice! The chill from the Spring evening was taken away with the fireplace. But a cloud burst happened, and we had to be moved inside to finish dinner up. We sat the in glass room in the front near the front door.  Many enjoyed having cocktails by the fireplace.  With the opening up of the patio, many more tables are now available. This should reduce the waiting time some writers referred to.  Good experience. Smaller menu, but all 1st Class dishes.",

Succulent and pan seared w/ reduced juices like chefs do short ribs. OMG (licking fingers right now)! Its served open-faced on Texas toast and all w/ all the traditional pot roast veggies. But as anyone will tell you, I can usually figure out a way to up the ante on a dish. So! Instead of Texas toast, I asked for it to be served atop of their roasted corn polenta....Au jus gravy dripping down the sides of the polenta mound. Oh Yeah! I see you licking your chops!   My server told me \"no\" to substituting the Texas toast. So... again...sitting at the \"kitchen counter\" as usual....I just looked at Cole and gave him the pouty face. He said \"Ok\"! :))  My friend had the Fred Flintstone sized pork chop...that was deeee-lish! But we both agreed that mine was better (wink).   No desert this time. More vino was my desert. I must have had the last of their Patz and Hall Pinot Noir on my last visit. Nooooo.....I wasn't driving. Lol  Bon Appetite!",

Eating at the counter facing into the kitchen afforded us a real look at how much care and attention is put into the food, even though it comes out at a great pace.  A chef named Cole manned the impressive wood-fired oven with ease and confidence, and all the while he and the other chef making all the salads took our questions and offered up useful information with a smile on their faces.  Rather than get into details on each dish, I posted pictures of most of what we ate. Can't wait to explore the whole menu and look forward to specials and new additions.  St Francis is a gem: a stylish modern bomb shelter of a place, serving up skillfully crafted comfort food. The neighborhood it's named after is lucky it landed where it did. Plus it would suck to name a restaurant \"Campus Vista\" or \"Scary Place Where Carolina's Is\".",

Let me explain, I drive by every day on the way home from work, and I can't help taking my eyes off the road to check out this ultra-cool restaurant. I began harassing Sean M. to accompany me to taste the menu so that I could stop creeping and start enjoying the food. My persistence paid off, as it usually does, and we made St. Francis our top choice for Sunday brunch this weekend.  The wait was a little long but the day was beautiful and I wasn't raging around like a hungry monster so I didn't mind. We were seated after about 30 minutes, but you can make reservations to avoid waiting if you prefer.  We started brunch by splitting a cinnamon roll. It was moist and covered in caramel sauce which was a nice touch to the iced variety that I am used to. It was huge and only cost $5.00. Totally worth it.   Up next was the salmon eggs benedict. This is one of the best versions of this dish I have ever had. The flavors just work. The english muffin is sourdough with some kind of garlic-y spread underneath salmon, perfectly poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. Amazing!  We did not sample the drink menu on this trip. I am of the opinion mimosas and bloody mary's should be between $3-$5 on Sundays (it is the day of rest, after all), so I couldn't do the $9 that the menu was asking for.  Overall, a wonderful experience! I can't wait to check out the menu for my other favorite meal, happy hour!",

A chic and cozy interior, fantastic music rotation and lovely beverage choices all of which provide for a dark and steamy evening out whether it's with the girls or on a date.  The food is quite something. As much as I restrain myself at the average eating establishment when it comes to bread, St. Francis is different. To not eat the bread and olive oil is to deny yourself a mouthful of fluffy pleasure only found on the other side of the Atlantic. The flatbreads are scrumptious and don't even get me started on those fingerling potatoes. They crunch to perfection and hardly need the dipping sauces that accompany.  To be honest, I've never been impressed with the service. But I'm still giving them 5 stars. Their happy hour is one of the best in Phoenix and they have enough going on for them that as long as the mediocre service isn't disrupting my enjoyment of a glass of wine, then we're good.",

I noticed that a couple seated after us had already received their appetizer before we even placed our drink order. This guy didn't discriminate either, the table next to us actually left because he hadn't greeted them after 20 minutes. Other than that, food and drinks were excellent, short wait for a table, and the ambiance was enjoyable. We will definitely return. Hopefully this was just an off night for the server and not indicative of what we can expect in the future. I recommend the pork chile verde and baked goat cheese.

    "text": "St. Francis, you have a new fan! Went here last night for our monthly Supper Club dinner and enjoyed every minute (we spent a good two hours here).  We reserved a table for nine at 6pm and were seated by 6:15. We ended up with a large table in the corner near the kitchen. The table had a mix of four chairs and two long benches, so that was interesting (table was sort of too high though). Three in our party couldn't make it, but that was a blessing in disguise because it afforded us the chance to spread out and be more comfortable.   The restaurant's design is a mix of modern, trendy and rustic (brick walls and benches) that blended nicely together. Loved the ambient lighting - very cozy and romantic! This is a great place for dinner and drinks with friends (inside) and for a date (patio area).   Our waitress Meschelle was one of the best servers I've encountered at any restaurant. She was very attentive to our needs and knowledgeable about the food and drink options; her suggestions were spot on.   To start, we ordered a bottle of the Clean Slate Riesling ($35, a white imported from Germany), the parmesan risotto ($10) and the baked goat cheese ($10). I loved the Riesling - it was light, crisp, slightly sweet, and very smooth. The BCG came out first - the crostini was too hard and the baked goat cheese, pesto and tomato sauce was too tart. The risotto was plated nicely and tasted even better. I loved the caramelized brussel sprouts, cippolini onions and the slices of cajun ham; each bite was lovely. One of the gals said it was cooked too al dente for her, but it was fine to me.   Next we ordered a bottle of the Catena Malbec ($43, a red imported from Argentina). The wine is a beautiful, deep red with a full-bodied, smooth flavor - which went well with my entree (the prime hanger steak, $24, cooked medium well). The others ordered the Moroccan meatballs ($15), pot roast ($19), roasted chicken ($17), and two of the roasted salmon ($22 each). My steak was served on a bed of whipped (mashed) potatoes, veggies (arugula/sliced boiled potatoes/slices of artichoke) and topped off with a red wine sauce. Other than the boiled potatoes being too al dente, my entree was SO GOOD. (I think the steak would have tasted better if I had it cooked medium.) I tried a bite of the Moroccan meatball, pot roast, and roasted chicken; all tasted great! The pot roast was so tender and full of flavor; the best pot roast I've tasted thus far. This will be my entree of choice when I visit again. Everyone gave the food two thumbs up.  Next we ordered a bottle of the Hullabaloo Zinfandel ($39, a red from Napa Valley). The wine is a beautiful deep red, but too full-bodied for my taste - especially since we're moving on to dessert. I wanted to order the Moscato to go with dessert, but was outvoted - wah, wah. We ordered the chocolate spice cake ($8) and cheesecake in a jar ($8) to share. Although the spice cake was presented beautifully, and was served with maple pumpkin gelato, I was not sold. The initial bite of the cake was full of chocolate flavor, but then the spice hits the palate and it was too strong. However, the cheesecake in a jar was AWESOME! I tried only one bite, but savored each burst of flavor. What made the cheesecake great was the almond crumble.  Our bill came to $297, not inclusive of the 20% gratuity we added to the bill. Not a bad price to pay for great food, great wine and quality time with friends. ;)  Thanks for reading my mini-book Yelpers!",

This took us by surprise, but at least we didn't have to stress about parking.   The hostesses were very nice and efficient. We waited for our party at the outside bar which was very comfortable. Once it was dark they projected a movie/TV onto the wall which was cool.  The interior was lovely! Industrial lights and red brick walls. Beautiful paintings and cool architecture. I found myself inspired by the decor. The tables were really close together, but it was okay.  The service was great. They were on top of the water refills, so we were never thirsty. There may or may not have been an incident where the bus boy dripped olive oil on our friends one year old. This was just a speculation because we didn't see it happen. In any case she cleaned up easily and there was no harm done. The waiter was good at clearing away our plates and making sure we were happy.  Good food! The French onion burger was way too good. I suspect someone exchanged their soul for the recipe. I got the pork chile verde, which was good, but probably not the best thing on the menu.   I can't wait to go back again. It will be a good date night with my husband.",

    "text": "I've been here a handful of times and always had a pleasant experience. Until I went to the brunch. We had 6 people and reservations, so we were seated immediately. I thought we waited slightly longer then we should have to place our orders, but everyone is talking & having fun so I wouldn't mark that against them. I didn't see any $5 cocktails as mentioned in another review. That is something I usually enjoy in most central Phx brunch spots.  So we order and no joke it took 1 hour to get our food. The server never once apologized or even commented about the wait until we asked. He told us since we were a large party the kitchen gets backed up. 6? Is a large enough party to throw off the entire kitchen? When we did finally get our food, 4 of us were served and the other 2 waited for 5 more min.... Even though they were the same dishes as the next person.  The food was good, never had a problem with that part.  This is when we probably bothered the server by asking him to split charges on 4 different cards. 2 were a couple & 1 had cash. Gratuity was included so we told him exact amount to charge on every card. Equally divided, doubled for the couple. He took the time to identify who's card belonged to who, but when he rang it up, realized it didn't add up (cuz of missing cash) instead of walking the 10 feet to table to double check, he decided to divide it evenly among cards. Ugh we already had this figured out. He came back and everyone was upset about it. He then got snippy and said well I have to refund everyone and redo it. Yes you do. A simple walk over when amounts didn't match up would have saved a lot of time. I allowed myself 1hr & 45 min to have brunch and get to my next engagement. 2hrs and 15 min later we were still getting the check mess figured out. This was not due to lingering & drinking. This was how long it took to get us food and get us out the door.  I really should have spoke to the manager, but I just didn't want to be the a second longer. I was over an hour late to next event :(",

We almost left, it was so noisy we couldn't have a conversation and neither of us could hear the drink special from our waitress. The noise level did get better towards the middle of our stay I guess if you are there during the happy hour you might hit them when they are busy and noisy.  However  The food was good, I started with a little romaine salad it was only $3. it was good except for the apple slices that tasted like onions (that might mean something wasn't cleaned). My roasted salmon was delicious and came over a cold quinoa salad. I was surprised to find out they use high quality Scottish Salmon that only better restaurants use.   My companion had the cheese flat bread and the Pork Chile Verde and was pleased.  We spent much less here on dinner than we would have spent at many other places having a similar meal.  I do plan to return but will wait for a patio seat where dining is much more pleasant.",

The walk up bar is the coolest part of the place and the happy hour isn't a bad bet at all but since the drinks were made from someone with Stevie Wonder's eyesight.  The vodka gimlet was pretty bad, I mean it tasted like straight lime juice.  Wouldn't sell someone on this place if there was a better alternative but if you got absolutely nothing else to do.....give it a try.  I would say that the crowd here is in the upper 30's to 50's age demographic.   I did find that the bathrooms were unique and were given more attention to detail than the menu.",

    "text": "I don't often review places on Yelp because of the time commitment and because usually I am just looking for a good bite to eat. This time, though I feel I should if not to balance the ridiculous number of 4 and 5 stars bouncing around for this place. The food was decent, and the atmosphere OK but seriously, how can this place cost as much as it does ($60+ for two people eating light)?? And how are people fawning all over it? I don't like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I can't seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis' class.   I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price.  The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before.   In the end I guess I would say if they would knock about $10 off of each plate, and cut some of the pretentious attitude, I would probably be offering a much  better review.   I am not planning a return anytime soon.",

I rolled in for a late day brunch with a girlfriend and was immediately seated and got to ordering right away. The menu is pretty straight forward and not real complicated.   I was in the mood for booze, really when am I not in the mood for booze, and Francis, you saint you, you delivered this fantastic gin cooler. It was excellent and I made me think I should have a pool party and serve them to all my friends, or just sit at your bar and order another! With my booze, I needed some food and I went with the eggs benedict. Hollandaise sauce is the True test of a good eggs benny. Your hollandaise is really good. Fabulous in fact. The eggs were nicely poached and I have no idea what you do with the english muffins but there was something spectular about them....All around tasty.   All and all, I can definitely see myself coming back the only draw back is the parking....more parking please!",

St. Francis, Central Phx thanks you.  Came by for a cocktail and an appetizer. Sat at the outside bar and got great service!   The baked goat cheese appetizer was warm & delicious.  Had a well made martini and the lady had a tasty Almond Margarita.  Cool decor, i love the glass cube window booth in the front, very mod.  The crowd was great.  Full house and a good mixed crowd of all ages & types... everyone was really friendly & having a good time.    The only complaint we had was that the dinner menu wasnt too extensive.  Only about 6 options and nothing really caught our eye.  We ended up just having cocktails for a bit and then took off for somewhere else.  Overall... another cool spot in CenPho.  I'll definitely be back for drinks afterwork sometime soon.  Update: Came back and had the Salmon over red quinoa.  It was excellent.  Also put back a few good brews. Dogfish Head 90 min IPA is always a favorite. The bar manager knows quite a bit about the wine and beer that he carries. Nice Job St. Fran.",

    "text": "Father's Day marked my third visit to St. Francis.  I haven't been disappointed yet.  Some reviewers complain the menu is small, but the menu changes constantly, as St. Francis uses fresh, local ingredients--exactly why I love it.  The St. Francis Meyer Lemonade is a lovely way to start off the evening.  I had mine made with honey-infused vodka.  Then, you're brought fresh-baked bread and olive oil for dipping.  I've had few of their salads, the one with green goddess dressing is divine (the veggies on it were different both times), the buttermilk-dressing salad was fine as well, though less memorable.  The roast chicken has been my favorite entree there, with the hangar steak being a close second.  Whatever you do, save room for dessert.  I don't normally order dessert out.  The first time I ate there, however, the server offered us a free dessert, because the kitchen forgot to put our mushroom sauce on the side.  Too full to eat it that night, I ordered a rhubarb-berry galette with almond creme fraiche to go.  The next day, I took a nibble from the edge.  Oh, wow.  I ate the whole thing right there, standing in front of the fridge.  I was sold, and made it a point to eat dessert there every visit.   Of the desserts I've tried (chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato and caramel corn, that infamous galette, and some architectural creation with blackberries and mascarpone), the best, hands down, is the sticky toffee pudding.  I've had it twice now--each time it was a little different, both times my dining companions and I battled for the last bite.  Sure, the building is cool, the brick oven is neat, the place is trendy, but it's a restaurant.  The food should be the priority.  For those of us really, REALLY into beautifully combined, high-quality, fresh ingredients, St. Francis is heaven.",

For entree's, I had the Moroccan meatballs, an excellent choice.  My companions had the pulled pig sandwich, which was good, the risotto, and the definite winner of the the day, the pork chile verde with two eggs on top.  That dish was simply amazing.  Also, we tried the caramel toffee pudding, half of us loved it and half of us left it; it is very sweet.  One caveat, this is not a business luncheon place:  service is very, very slow.  We were at leisure, so it was fine with us, but this was a two-hour lunch from the time we sat down until we paid out.

    "text": "All hail the server that gave me a to go container of the caramel popcorn on my way out! There's a deeper, sexier story about the caramel popcorn.. but I'll get back to that.  Now that I have your attention... ;)  What a nice little place this is. I was there on a Thursday night and it was rather peaceful and quiet. The relaxing atmosphere was just what the doctor ordered on a night of catching up with a friend I haven't seen in awhile.  While it seems small, I am amazed at how much space there really is there.   I started with an arnold palmer which was delicious. So much so, that I stayed with it the entire night. Everything on the menu to me looked good, but nothing really stood out as fantastic-I-have-to-have-that-right-now good. Craving flavor, as I have been lately, I went with the green chile stew item. While small, it was the right amount of food and had a pretty good flavor.   The killer part of the night though was the dessert that we shouldn't have had but decided to share. The one both of us agreed on was the chocolate cake with caramel. We were expecting cake. We were expecting gelato. We were expecting caramel. We were NOT expecting caramel corn.   Holy mouthgasm St. Francis!   I'm not a fan of super sweet things so the mix of the salty totally did me in and we found ourselves eating almost every last bit of that cake. Heaven. Try that cake! At one point I believe I mentioned I wanted to marry whomever is responsible.  In the end, the dessert was fantastic and the mood was great, but none of the dishes screamed at me. I may be back for that cake though.",

A little bit after we ordered the waitress came out and apologized that the kitchen was slow and offered us soup and some bread complimentary.  Right after that arrived so did the food.  The wifes burger wasnt cooked to order and they fixed it promptly.  The service is what made up for the little wait and the kitchen error.  Would highly recommend.",

I mean the lighting, the sound level, the atmosphere was spot on.  We only had drinks and apps but they were as good as the space.  The fingerling potatoes and baked goat cheese appetizers were enough. Portions on the apps we had were big and between the two of us we ate the goat cheese and had plenty of potatoes left over.  Do not order those as your own app, you need to share that one.  I can not rate the entrees but will return and try them next time I am in Phoenix. Oh and the valet parking is free, I always love that! And of course I did tip them.",

    "text": "Okay, so, yes: the decor is divine, original and edgy without being overly trendy or plastic. I sincerely wish my home looked like this. The bathroom sinks? Genius. Cool as hell.  That's kind of where my infatuation with St. Francis ends. My frustration started the second I pulled in the parking lot. Valet only? Really? We're not in Paradise Valley, people. Look to your right. Your evening's backdrop is a busy six lane street-cum-drag strip and Castle Boutique.  Oops! My first interaction with the \"hostess\" made me wonder once again if somehow I was beamed to PV from central Phoenix. Unsmiling, unfriendly, and downright grim, she refused to seat my party until all were present. And that was that. No directions to the bar, nary a hint of a smile. Maybe her ponytail was too tight or her Tory Burch flats hurt her feet. I don't know. I quickly renamed her The F.N.B., and I will totally give ten dollars to the person who can guess what it stands for.  My friend and I found the bar anyway, with our internal GPS homing devices to alcohol and all. The wine list was okay. Prices average. The syrah was nice, and I was kind of intrigued by the almond margarita, but not willing-to-be-$10-poorer-intrigued. Perhaps more bizarre, I spied more $2000+ handbags on the patio that evening than you can sometimes see in an entire day at Fashion Square. We parked our asses on the patio, drank wine, and bitched until our straggler arrived.   Finally! We are sprinkled with fairy dust and granted admission to the dining room!... but instead we were led back outside. Whatever. Our server was pleasant and prompt - absolutely no complaints. The menu is on the small side, and not what I would call a vegetarian's delight. I ended up with the broccolini flatbread (i.e., pizza), which was a decent size for the $13. It was tasty, but the lemon zest (!) and whole cloves of garlic took its yum factor down a tick or two. My friends each got the whitefish, which at $24 seemed a little steep for a little chunk of fish and three little potatoes. They seemed pretty meh about it, and neither one polished it off.   The highlight of the evening may have been when I laughed at my friend because the valet parked her American SUV in the back and put my new car up front. Hey, that's a first, people. But, really, if that's the best part of the night, what does that say about St. Francis? Kind of a letdown. Not a crashing disappointment like Oh my god, I've been up all night puking up wasabi from that bad sushi, but still a bit of a disappointment nonetheless. WIll I be back? Maybe to park my drunk ass on the patio and spy on the Castle patrons, but probably not for dinner...",

    "text": "Not that impressed with my first visit here, the place is beautifully decorated and ambiance is romantic cute but it stops there.  The place was hopping with happy hour folks when we went so I think drink specials are a plus here but I wasn't that excited when I saw the menu options. It appears to be more of a place to see and be seen and many 5 star reviews were over their brunch menu which I haven't tried so I can't comment there but for lunch everything was way over priced and being in midtown Phoenix I was surprised.  The most appetizing option I saw was the salmon superfood but it was $25 which seems excessive.  I have to say though their crusty artisan bread that they bake in a brick oven is amazing and worth the trip and the take home loaf is only $3. For my visit, I ordered the chicken sandwich and even though it was good, it wasn't memorable and cost $15 I think which seems excessive for a basic chicken sandwich when I can go down the street and get the same exact sandwich for half the price. A plus here is that kids always eat free. The chef/owner is renowned and the restaurant has the farm to table concept going on here so I can understand the pricey options but coming from Cali where farm to table is more common, it doesn't justify the high priced menu items for the area.",

    "text": "A while back I came across a blog post ranking the \"Best Burgers\" in each of the immediate 50 United States. I usually read these types of things with a grain of salt because, when it comes to independent food critics, it's just basically a matter of opinion. I looked at what this critic said was the best in the state of Arizona, and he stated \"St Francis Restaurant in Phoenix\". Hmm; by coincidence I had a preplanned trip in that area, so I decided to make reservations.  First off, I was not familiar with the area, so it wasn't that easy of a restaurant to find. When I got there, the very first thing that came across my mind was, \"Holy crap, I think we're underdressed.\" Complementary valet and seeing a sleek patio before we came in didn't help matters. Still, I came all this way....  We went in and got seated within a few minutes. For a Thursday night, I was surprised as to how busy the place was. The space wasn't too large, but the owners still made a good use of the space. The front area had a cool bar area that was open behind it to the main street area. Just off the street to the right side of the building was the patio area, behind it the parking/valet lot. We got seated in a spot right in the middle of the space. From my view, to the left the kitchen; to the center the bar, to the right the patio.   The waiter remarked about how the chef and much of the food was highly regarded and featured in a number of media. They were well known for their \"chile burger\", so I went with that for a standard dinner. The chile burger was a standard burger with pickled fresno chile, sweet and sour onions, shaved romaine, jack cheese, chipotle aioli on a bun. The bread was very good. Usually burgers have more or less a pinch of chiles as a topping; this thing had a sheet of them. Holy moly. However, the balance was the aioli sauce which didn't make the dish too hot.   I liked this place. I came for the burgers, but I was also tempted to come back the next day to try their seafood dishes. Overall a great experience.",

We called a day ahead hoping to get a reservation but they were not taking anymore by that time (read as: we are 3 generations of slackers). However we were advised to try to come in between the lunch rush and the dinner rush so we could avoid a long wait. It was the best, most perfect advice :) As always, our servers were super friendly and answered our bazillion questions. It was my first time at St Francis with a large group and it turned out that they accommodate large groups very well. Even on a busy day like Mother's Day. The food was amazing, as always. I love the farm to table inspiration and their oven fired flatbreads. The only mild disappointment was that they had run out of fresh baguettes for me to take home and I didn't realize it until we were packing up to leave :( Understandable, as it was already late in the day. The manager Ken swooped in and handed me a gift card so I could grab a loaf on my next visit. It was totally not necessary but it will definitely be put it to use as St Francis is one of my all time favorite spots in town! And it was a sweet gesture on Mother's Day. Thanks everyone for making our day special :)",

I tried to not breathe in as I drank until one of my comrades was like \"WTH?\" as he sipped his. We then watched as the bartenders refilled empty juice containers without rinsing them, and wiped more glasses with towels that were getting a lot of use. The bar was also really dirty. \"They need to hire a chick\", was one suggestion. That might work, depending on the chick. This so detracted from the experience that though the food was stellar, and it so was, I cannot say I enjoyed it as I may have if I wasn't smelling mildew glass the whole time. \"Why didn't you ask them to clean your glass?\", you ask? Because they were cleaning EVERYTHING with these same gross towels and I was afraid to. Big wins-Mongolian Meatballs and Cheese Flatbread. Skip the bar, sit at a table and drink from the bottle...",

Fingerling potatoes were very yummy with fried sage and rosemary and a lemon aioli. The french onion burger was AMAZING and ranks high on my list of delicious burgers. The forbidden rice was really good too and had a delicious sweet coconutty taste to it. Drinks were real cheap too - I got a four peaks hop knot for less than the price of a diet coke!   I'll definitely be going back.",

Sometimes I get the fried egg sandwich, no bread (I'm GF), but I am told their breads are really wonderful.  For dinner let me suggest the Baked Goat Cheese. Since I can't have bread, I ask for cucumber slices to have with. So good! I have had their French Onion Burger (no bread, no fried onions - sub pickled onions instead) and it is every bit as good as the name implies. Their fries are also really good and I consider myself a fry aficionado. The chicken salad is also really yummy. I would also highly recommend the Big Pig, it's like a French Dip but with pork and gruyere cheese, pure awesomeness! For happy hour, the Cucumber Cooler and Santa Rosa are my recommendations. The only reason I give them a 4 instead of a 5 is the gluten-free factor. But I do enjoy the food I can have and will keep coming back.",

    "text": "Beautiful restaurant with great atmosphere. We enjoyed our food on the patio with decent service. Then the check came...I paid cash for our part of the $163 bill and our friends paid with a gift card for their portion. That confused something with the server and the gift card company and we really feel we paid more than what was necessary. Spent the last :20 at our table calculating the bill, which should have been easy but became ridiculous. The server couldn't really explain it either so that was no help.  We then got out to the required valet parking stand (\"complimentary\" what a racket!) and waited for at least 5 minutes for an attendant to appear. I gave him our ticket along with $5 because that's what you're supposed to do...tip. Mamma raised me right.   The attendant huffed off but since the car was right next to us I said he didn't need to get it. He yelled that it's required and slammed the car out of the space, nearly hitting a car entering in the lot head-on and stopped abruptly. He then got out mumbling that it was ok that nobody else was tipping that night either and he was quitting. Ummm. I just gave you freaking $5, why are you being rude to me? Why are you nearly crashing my car? He continued his rant and said we would never see him again, he's quitting...blah...  Not sure what happened there but the check and the valet fiasco really dampened  a pleasant evening.   I thought I would place a quick call to the manager on the way home. I probably shouldn't have. All she could do was blame the gift card co and the 3rd party valet service. Pretty much didn't care. As a business, who you use to provide services to your customers is your responsibility and reflects on you. I would suggest getting rid of the valet parking. It's a rip-off.  I likely will not return. Ugh.",

My favorites are the meatballs (make sure you add the egg), fingerling potatoes, pork chili verde  and the cinnamon roll on the brunch menu. Happy hour is also a great deal. $5 specialty cocktails, 1/2 off beer and wine, and a good selection of discounted food.  As much as I love the food at St. Francis, I have been pretty disappointed in the service on my last few visits. The wait staff are all friendly, but they are incredibly slow. I also feel like the food is a little too pricey for what you get.   My least favorite thing about St. Francis: if you get stuck sitting at one of the \"booths\" it is the most uncomfortable dining experience. There is no back between the booths, so if someone is sitting in the booth behind you, it's incredibly awkward because you can't sit back and be comfortable. On the plus side, trying to avoid touching backs with the person behind you results in excellent posture for the duration of your meal.",

No comments,  just oh...do you need a table?  Um....yea!!! I didn't come in just to stand and watch you work.   The server seemed nice.  Waiting to place my order now.  We'll see how the rest of my service is. I hope it was just am isolated incident. Sure did put me in a funk mood.

    "text": "I don't usually write negative reviews, especially when the only negative thing was the service, but the service was sooooo bad for such a nice restaurant that I thought I should say something. I went with a party of about ten people. One of our party told the waiter at the beginning to split the check, but apparently he didn't hear - more on that later. Basically, he was non existent the whole time. He came over for the drink order, another server brought the drinks, he came over a half hour later to get our dinner order, and other than bringing out food about 45 minutes later, he never came around again.Not once did he \"check\" on us. We were ready to order almost right away, and normally servers as if you want to order appetizers before the main course, but he never came around. Others came by and filled our drinks. If we needed something we had to track him down. He forgot some of the food (thankfully he took it off the bill). 2 1/2 hours later we tracked him down and asked for the bill. That took awhile for him to bring over, one of our party had an emergency and had to leave, but it took another half hour to sort out the whole bill situation. First he brought it all one one check and then when he was reminded that we needed it split, he got almost all of the orders incorrect.  The whole time I was checking to find an excuse for his behavior. Was the restaurant super busy, under staffed (it wasn't - and we never saw a manager) he didn't seem upset or stressed, just apathetic, were there issues in the kitchen (nope- they were churning out food no problem)? I couldn't figure it out. Finally when we got our check it was 20% gratuity. It was frustrating, but it might have explained his behavior. We might have stayed and complained, but we wanted to get to the Heard Museum, since it is free first Fridays from 6-10. Unfortunately, they stopped letting people in at 9:00 and it was 9:10 when we got there.  Disclaimer: most of us in the party have had experience in the service industry, we were very nice and didn't put up any fuss until the check issue. Also, the food was really really good. And the atmosphere was great. It was just some of the worst service I've ever had - mostly just because it wasn't hardly any service at all. :/ Ok, I'm going to go write a positive review now. :)",

    "text": "I have been to this restaurant on several occasions, including my most recent experiences with their brunch menu. The atmosphere was much more upbeat in the morning than their dinner hours. Facing the street was the open bar accompanied by the sunny patio. On this Sunday, the lazy sunshine was slowly triggering through its rustic interior.   I highly recommend their Eggs Benedict ($13). My dish came with perfectly poached eggs, English muffin, hollandaise sauce, crispy potatoes, and smoked salmon. The thick cut smoked salmon was delicious and not too salty. The thick gooey hollandaise sauce added refinement to the fantastic doughy texture of the English muffin. There was great purpose, balance and distribution of flavors. The potatoes were lightly salted and quite addictive. It had all the elements I was looking for in a benedict.   I also enjoyed the Fall Squash Risotto ($13) served with crispy pork belly, squash, parmesan, rosemary honey, and risotto. The pork belly was nicely marbled to provide a nice contrast to the perfectly executed risotto. I wished this dish could come with more squash to accompany the risotto, but otherwise it's a dish I'd order again.  The Farmer's Market Frittata ($10) was really fantastic too. It came with oyster mushrooms, asparagus, cheddar, arugula, tomato, and other seasonal vegetables layered on top of the omelet. The combination of veggies was fresh and the range of diverse flavors further complicated the omelet at the bottom. It's a lighter alternative than the benedict, but we still had plenty of leftover to take home.  The dishes that did not live up to my expectations were the Cinnamon Roll ($5) and the Iron Skillet Pancake ($8). The Cinnamon Roll was expensive but also humongous and good to share. It tasted dry, bread-like, and lacked the full on moisture that I prefer in a cinnamon roll. It's a novelty and highly visible at every table, but unfortunately not something I'll be ordering again.   The Iron Skillet Pancake came with olive oil, dark chocolate, berry compote, whipped cream, and maple syrup. The price was too steep for a single pancake. The pancake was easy to cut into until the sticky crispy outer ring. The berry compote was overwhelming the dark chocolate, but it was still a decent pancake without the expected wow factor.  My dining companion did not enjoy the coffee, so it's not something I would recommend. Service can be inconsistent, but friendly and responsive when you have their attention. There's not a lot of innovative breakfast and brunch restaurants in the Phoenix area, so St. Francis is a solid option for those looking for conventional wisdom with a twist of refinement. The other downside to the experience was parking. They have a small lot, and the required valet can be frustrating as you wait for your car when it is parked right in front of you.   With all considered, 3.5 stars for the overall experience. I'd be interested in coming back for dinner.",

My husband got the swordfish entree and it was ok, but he also got a side of fries and they were very soggy and greasy. Not the crisp gourmet fry you'd expect at a nice place. I had the shrimp risotto and it had almost no flavor- the menu said it had parmesan and meyer lemon and none of that came through, and was in desperate need of seasoning (I was piling on the table salt which I never do). I also had a side of cornbread and the flavor was good but it was on the dry side. The silver lining was that the service was very nice and when I gently told them I wasn't very thrilled with my dish they were very gracious and took it off the bill. I do really appreciate that they handled it well! We may try them out again but this first pass was a let-down :(",

Everything (drinks, apps, food, dessert & service) was top notch.  It was little pricey for us but we feel we got what we paid for.  Will definitely be back!",

The Pig Dip is not for the faint of heart - crusty banquette, bacon, pork tenderloin, onion marmalade and Gruyere cheese, and of course pig dip. The sandwich is savory with a hint of sweetness from the onion marmalade.   Delicious a we will be back next time we are in town.",

I went with my dad and we split the chicken flat bread and the braised beef sandwich with the quinoa side salad. It was a lot of food! we ended up taking half of it home. Anyway, I thought the sandwich was good, but could have used some veg or something on it so it wasn't just meat and bread. In addition, the flatbread was good, but could have used more flavor too! It has really delicious caramelized onions, which gave it the majority of its flavor, but it could have had more seasoning or a sauce of sort.... The quinoa salad was really good, I would definitely eat that again. Also, the service was very attentive, when my dad went to the bathroom, the server came over and refolded his napkin.... kind of weird, but nice I suppose. Overall, I thought it was good, my dad liked it more than I did, and I would like to try this restaurant again.",

    "text": "I was one of the first patrons for lunch, I park in the lot on the side, open the door and walk in...and get fairly rudely told by one of the servers that I've just entered the wrong door and if I would like to go to the front and wait for the hostess, I can be seated. Not the best start to the meal.  I ordered a bunch of food figuring I'd sample it all and decide if I like the restaurant enough to bring my wife by at another time.  First I got the hamburger w/bacon and gruyere. By the time it got to me, the bun was completely soggy under the burger. The bread was too soft and porous, and there was nothing between the burger and the bread. The biggest crime here was that the menu said it was served w/an aioli...and it was, on the side. If they had just put a nice thin coat of it on the bun then the juices wouldn't have turned my bun into a fall apart mess. The crispy onions on top were nice though, and the burger was cooked a nice medium. HOWEVER, I also got a side of the fingerling potatos...disaster. They were charred little briquette lumps, which was a shame, because I had really been looking forward to them. Only about 1/4 were even edible.  Second, I ordered the cheese flatbread, thinking it would be like it said on the menu, flatbread w/cheese and herbs. However they made the mistake a lot of lesser restaurants make, they brought me a pizza. Look, quick easy difference between pizza and flatbread...sauce. If you put tomato sauce and cheese on it, it is a flatbread pizza. If you MEAN flatbread pizza you should say that on the menu. No big, it still tasted good, except again...soggy. Like, fall apart soggy. A shame.  Third, I went for the cheesecake for dessert. First problem w/this? It took 15 minutes to get my cheesecake. Not even kidding. They weren't that busy, and my server stopped by twice while I was waiting to refill my water. Not once did he say, \"hey, that'll be up in just a moment\" or offer any explanation. Weird. Second problem, when it finally does come, it is a bell jar with an inch of cheesecake in the bottom, a combination of canned fruit and candied nuts on top of that, and about 3 inches of whipped cream filling the top of the jar. Do you have any idea how hard that is to eat? Ridiculous. I was angry because actually tasted good, but it was so hard to eat!  In my book, 3 near misses. They're so close to being a really good restaurant, but right now they just aren't there.",

I have to say that after reading a few reviews, I was looking forward to the bread since everyone seemed to think it was amazing. I was not that impressed with it, I've had better. The potatoes were very good though. For the entree, we ordered their special, some kind of pork loin with arugula salad on top and some kind of creamy tomato base. It was delicious!! We also had the strawberry cheesecake dessert in a jar, fantastic!! We will definitely be adding this one to our restaurant repertoire.",

Obviously a lot of thought and money has gone into the design of space, lighting textures. Even the tee shirts were very cool.   My main issue. I was hungry..  There are four appetizers on the menu. A chowder, French fries, Goat cheese & Pesto with sliced bread and a caesar type salad. My problem with such a limited menu is that I find myself choosing what I will have by elimination rather than having trouble deciding because everything sounds so good.  Don't get me wrong the food is quite good. Along with the menu being so limited, portion sizes a very small. I wish they had of spent more time and money on the food than on the space.  So if your going to a restaurant because you want to sit in a really fun and exciting space but aren't too hungry. And don't mind dropping 120.00 then this is your place.",

I only had a bite of the fish so I can't speak that much to it, the bf enjoyed it.. it had too much lemon in the sauce for me, but I hate lemon flavoring so it's probably better to take his word for it!   The steak had this amazing sauce that accompanied it that added such a nice flavor to compliment the steak.  Both entrees were pretty good size portions, especially after appetizers. And we also split a side of sweet corn polenta that we couldn't finish  The actual restaurant its self is very open, there is an outside covered patio and a smaller patio for the bar that's out in the open.

In the end I went for the white fish with moroccan spices and the apero cocktail. Totally delicious, both of them. The fish especially was wonderful, light, the spices just right.

Vive St Francis!",

Atmosphere is fabulous, service is outstanding and attentive, and the food is scrumptious.  I started with the Romaine salad which was super yummy.  I also had the Green chile Stew-So good and that cornbread, I dream about it.   But the best part was dessert.  Chocolate Cake with Peanut Butter gelato?  Do I even need to explain why that was good?   Thank you St Francis for not using the old standard of \"vanilla bean gelato\".  The peanut butter gelato made it extraordinary.   Looking forward to a return trip soon.  Oh Oh, I almost forgot.  We started out as a party of four and six friends of ours showed up after we had ordered starters.  The staff HAPPILY accommodated all of us at one table by pushing sections together.  Thanks St Francis team...you are the best!",

This came up on Yelp and sounded promising but we were worried about a long impending wait.  I clicked through to Open Table and they happened to have a table available in 5 minutes, then nothing more for the next hour.  We took it and were seated immediately in the crowded restaurant. Yay!  Both food and service were excellent. In our group we had the Fingerling Potatoes app (amazing), the Salmon (cooked perfectly), the Pork Chili Verde (good, but I was told not very spicy which was a disappointment), the French Dip Burger (incredible), and the Meatballs (very flavorful).  The prices were reasonable. We look forward to going back.   Other notes: They have a really cute patio with a fire, sofas and a Charlie Chaplin movie playing on the wall, making for a fun ambience. They only have valet parking so plan for a few extra bucks there.",

She decided to have the Seafood Stew (the only reason for the 4 stars) and wanted more substance.  Yes, it was great, but it needed to have more Mussels, or Shrimp or Clams, just more to it.  We had the the Paltz & Hall, Pinot Noir (recommended by Ryan) - an excellent choice from the small but delectable menu.    Overall, imagine Postino & radioMILANO with a hint of LA cool...  Great location, staff was on it and there were many patrons just there to have a libation (love to use this word).  I will return!

The service for a party of ten was not the best- even though we had the entire second floor to ourselves- they only had two servers on at noon on a Friday at lunch. Not the best planning. Also, word to the wise ladies- do NOT sit your purse on the counter in the restroom. It LOOKS like a counter- but is a motion sensitive sink. Glad I have fast relfexes and a dry wallet! Just sayin'.

We put our names on the waiting list and were told the wait would be approximately 30-45 minutes.  We sat down researching wines on our phones for a good 15 minutes or so before we were called to our table.  Sweet!  We got the meatballs (with the hen egg on top of course) and seafood cioppino.  While drinking our wine, we decided it would be wise to order some bread.  I wish I could get my crusts as crusty as their crusts (yes, I did just use 'crust' three times).  The spices in the meatballs made the dish for me.  The dish is simple, but packs a very powerful punch of flavor.  Perfect for dipping our wonderfully crusted sourdough baguette into (when we didn't dip it into our olive oil and balsamic sauce - ask for balsamic on the side).  The cioppino was good as well - a nice mixture of clams, mussels, scallops and shrimp, and a sauce also worthy of sopping up with bread.  We also saw a server bringing out a fanastic-looking burger, which we ended up commenting on with the table next to us.  We'll come back for you next time, little guy.  For dessert, we ended up getting the cheesecake in a jar.  It had a nice tanginess to it, but a little less whipped cream on top would have been great.  And more crust.  In any case,  we didn't end up finishing it because we were full before we even ordered the cheesecake.  But we just had to see what a cheesecake in a jar was like.  Sweet spot for a nice evening out.  Be ready to spend a little.",

A glass of red and their finest meal.  The building is a perfect fusion of historic red Phoenix brick and Aaron Chamberlin modernism transformation. Our waiter Taylor was very attentive, pleasant and helpful. I believe we shall see him someday on Master Chief or possibly working his oven in chief whites.  For me, Truchard Pinot. Napa Valley, 13/48. A dry medium body with a plush finish, or what I would simply describe as \"The Blood of Christ.\"   With that came the prime hanger steak, whipped potatoes, farm vegetables, pine nut lemon relish and a wine sauce, 24. This meat has an intense flavor making it an ideal choice. The seasonal vegetables were excellent and the saucy spectacle accessorizing this steak vanished quickly.  My daughter had the roasted salmon, red quinoa, avocado, soy beans, radish, with sweet chili vinaigrette, 22. She loved everything but the quinoa. I took a few bites of the edible seed and loved it. It actually looked like purple rice and taste like cereal.  The oldest boy got the heirloom tomato and cumber salad, peppers, red onions, zinfandel wine vinaigrette [no wonder he loved his salad], goat cheese which he said \"what's that\" and the pine nuts, 10. He couldn't do the yellow tomatoes ether, I loved them.  And the baby got the free hamburger. It was shockingly huge. I had to cut it in half. Came with fries, so yum!   I believe, in this communal house even Deus would simply say \"Divine.\"",

    "text": "If you have yet to be to St. Francis Restaurant I'm pretty sure you don't know what life could be like!  This is THE perfect place - perfect place for what you ask?  How about for a birthday or some sort of celebration seated in the nook surrounded by floor to ceiling windows on three sides.  Or a romantic date night to impress your studly or lady friend.  Or a sophisticated spots to take potential clients. Or a relaxing environment to grab a glass of wine or a few cocktails.  Or even the perfect place to ride your beach cruiser to on a Sunday morning and enjoy a delicious brunch.  Yes this place is the perfect place for all of the above, pretty amazing right?  Now let me tell you why.  The space:  I feel like there are many urban type restaurants here in central Phoenix, but this restaurant is one of a few (if any others) that is built in the original old structure. There's a beautiful built in nook that can seat larger parties. Small intimate tables to encourage conversation. Exposed beams of the 2nd level of the restaurant. It's truly a restaurant that creates an open environment by opening a large garage door over the bar to serve the patrons outside and large glass doors that open to the patio with a beautiful wood burning fireplace.  The food: I have yet to have something I didn't love. The menu itself isn't huge but for some reason it's still so difficult to pick just one thing. For dinner you can't go wrong with their french union burger, flat breads, or pork chop. But if you want the best thing on the menu go for the hanger steak. It is one of the best steaks I have ever had in my entire life! If you happen to stop by on a weekend for brunch you need to try either the most amazing pancake you will ever put in your mouth or the salmon eggs benedict. Now I was a little skeptical of the salmon eggs benedict at first because regular eggs benedict is not only my favorite breakfast meal - it's my favorite food ever. But for the same price as the regular I thought I'd give it a try and I was not disappointed at all!   The service: Overall I have had Fantastic service at St. Francis. The wait staff is usually friendly and interactive. There was one time we had a server who seemed to be overwhelmed and we felt forgotten about, but that was only one time :)  Tips: If you're going for brunch try to make a reservation! It can get pretty packed. One time I was told an hour and a half wait (but it was really only about 25 minutes luckily...). If you need a cocktail they have a lemonade that's delicious and dangerous! Be careful - you'll fall in love with this place.",

Now, for the negatives--portion sizes were small. The \"entree\" salads were bigger than a dinner salad, but nowhere near the size of an entree. The Cioppino was in one of those dishes that is usually used to serve a side portion of creamed spinach. It initially looked like it was full of broth and seafood, but when you begin eating, you realize that almost the entire dish is full of bread, which is now soggy, as it is soaking in the broth. It was certainly not a $33 serving of Cioppino by any means. I travel to Chicago often, and have authentic Italian Cioppino with no soggy bread, and MUCH more seafood and broth for about the same price. So, value is not good here, but the seafood was properly prepared and not overcooked. The best thing about the dish was the flavorful fresh herbs. My husband like his salmon superfood dish.",

We were greeted by the warm, friendly hostess who offered us a seat on the patio until a table opened up. The bartender got our drinks quickly even though the bar was completely full. We sat on the beautiful patio enjoying our drinks until our table was ready.   Table service was fantastic as well and I ordered the halibut with couscous while my husband ordered the steak. The halibut was huge and cooked perfectly with a fabulous combination of flavors. The steak was very tender and juicy with a flavorful sauce. Also, the prices are very reasonable for what you get as our entrees were $23-$24 and they were pretty much the most expensive menu items. I would normally expect to pay much more for the type of food and level of service received.  St. Francis has it figured out with impressive customer service, an unbelievable menu, and relaxing ambiance. No wonder this place is packed all the time.",

    "text": "So it t'was valentines day and I decided last second that me and my date should go there for Vday dinner.  I personally have only had drinks there while my date had been some time before and actually had the food. She had said it was not that bad and since we were both pretty laid back considering the holiday I was not setting myself up for anything amazing.  We walked in maybe at the end of the dinner rush and found two seats at the bar quickly. A small bar space but intimate I guess. Greeted promptly by our bartender and bar-back with smiles and served my wine with a small recommendation based on what I like.  A good start so far.  Having just got done from teaching yoga my date wanted simple. \"Cheese flat bread please, to start\" i asked the bartender, Once finished consuming our starting plate i was neither impressed or disappointed. I mean who can really mess up a cheese pizza?? I do appreciate lots of basil and garlic though if the pizza is to be without any other special toppings. Anyways, still enjoyed it very much.  We ordered than the pot roast for our shared entree. I thoroughly enjoyed it but found the meat a bit cold on the bottom???? nothing worth sending it back since the rest of the plate was delicious but how was it any bit cool when it arrived so quickly? sort of a mystery to me.  Overall our dinner was short and we had a good experience. I would only say that a almost $20 plate should come out steaming hot. That is all. Service was top notch and I will definitely be back sooner than later :).  BTW their baker comes in after hours to make all of their bread. that is amazing and good luck finding that in most any other establishment.",

    "text": "My wife ordered the chicken salad sandwich which was a different take on chicken salad (little to no mayo) and pretty good. Her sister ordered the burger & was unimpressed. I ordered the DDD featured Pig Dip & was very disappointed.  The bread to meat ratio was disturbing (bready sandwiches disturb me :) & my first bite was uninspiring. The fries along side were piping hot but the sandwich was lukewarm.  The melted cheese was melted no more but appeared to have been sitting, waiting for the fries & turning into chewy mess. I mentioned the temperature to the waiter & he said he'd get me another.  A few minutes later he returns with a sandwich missing a bite. I expressed my disappointment that they re-heated my sammy at which point he tells me that the sandwich isn't supposed to be very hot in the 1st place. I was confused.    They did offer to replace my once bitten wich with something else so I chose the Pork Chili Verde. Now I'm on board, tender pork chunks in a thick spicy red sauce.  This dish was very satisfying & after I chopped up the roasted jalepeno it left a nice spice in my mouth well after my last bite. I would highly recommend this.  The Pig Dip situation left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended) but overall it was a decent experience. Restaurant was clean with a good atmosphere & our waiter was very good. Will I go again, maybe, but definitely not a place I'm already planning my next visit to.",

They have free valet service, which is nice and makes you feel welcome.  I had the Moroccan Spiced Meatballs, and they were absolutely delicious with sauce, cheese, and little pasta pearls. She had the Chile Verde Pork, served with a whole roasted green chile on top and side of cornbread.  Flavor country, population: us.  Cocktails were tasty and well balanced.  My St. Francis Lemonade was amazing and I don't usually go for cocktails. My girl had a Santa Rosa, made with fresh grapefruit, pulp included!  She had another and I took advantage of the smoking hot happy hour price of a $1.50 Four Peaks Hopknot.  Happy hour pricing put us at $35 for lunch and drinks, which was more than worth it.  I would expect dinner and drinks to be closer to $50 for two people.  Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu, although the hostesses were not in uniforms and not easily identified as staff, so it took a little bit at first to get seated.  The Pig Dip sounds like an amazing sandwich, but we'll save that for next time!  5 Stars for delicious seasonal menu, friendly people, and local-first Arizona beers!",

    "text": "St Francis has become a favorite Phoenix restaurant choice.  If I had to pick a last meal, it would be the baked goat cheese appetizer.  Seriously.  I would want the whole thing to myself with a glass of rose.  I have had their kale salad... LOVE, not like this salad.  Last night ,they didn't have kale salad on the menu (seasonal)  so I had the mixed green salad (beets, goat cheese, pistachios) and that was a nice runner up. The croutons in the salad were so good that even a non-crouton fan like myself, was oohing and ahhing.  I also had the pumpkin soup, which was fabulous!  This restaurant is absolutely darling.  I enjoy sitting outside on the patio or inside... both have a different vibe but both are equally charming.  Service has always been outstanding.  I've heard rave reviews about the burger and may one day need to try it to confirm. I wish we had gotten there before Happy Hour concluded yesterday because glasses of wine are half off and we enjoyed some vino!  Great wine list and delicious speciality cocktails!  Excited for my next trip to St Francis, since it's on my go-to list when visiting Phoenix.",

The beautiful two-story spot, with fresh flowers and candles on every table, as a very cozy vibe. Tables are close together inside, and there's a spacious patio and bar area. When I went, footage of Julia Child was being projected on a wall near the bar, adding a quirky and fun element to the otherwise posh restaurant.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the comfort food menu, offering up vegetarian options, giving his recommendations and explaining ingredients and cooking techniques in dishes.  We started out with Baked Goat Cheese ($9), which was a bowl of the cheese accompanied by crackers. The cheese and tomatoes were so good, but I preferred to dip the soft bread we got with our meal into it rather than the crispy baguette.  For my entree, I had a Vegetarian Flatbread pizza ($13), which had such soft dough. It was perfectly cooked-lots of cheese and veggies, including broccoli and tomatoes, and the crust was amazing.  For dessert, I had a to-die-for Roasted Blackberry and Mascarpone Cheese dish ($7). The cheese was so flavorful, and the fresh fruit made it a great summer dessert. St. Francis uses locally grown ingredients, and not only did the food taste great, it felt nice to be supporting sustainability.  I also had a Pineapple Rum Mojito ($9), which seemed heavy on the soda but was refreshing.  The whole vibe at St. Francis was peaceful and positive. Their menu changes with what's in season, and I can't wait to go back and try more of what the place has to offer.",

Ask patrons to step aside so drinks can be ordered or get some servers for the bar area. It's restaurant 101.   The wood fired vegetables are a joke--tomato puree, squash, and spaghetti squash? You wood fired spaghetti squash? The flat bread was decent and the fingerlings were ok. The standout was the forbidden rice bowl, delicious. Awkward service and swarms of flies all threw a wrench at the experience. I would not go back without a reservation, sharp elbows for the bar, and a freakin flyswatter.",

Service: The host was pleasant and accommodating when, right after he seated us, we asked to move outside. It was such a nice day. He had us sit by the outdoor fireplace while they cleaned a table for us. Our waiter was friendly, and a random waitress asked if she could turn our table around so my husband and I could sit together, rather than across from each other.  AND the manager (?) gave us free baked goodies from brunch!  Food: I had the pork chili verde. It was tasty and the cornbread- moist and sweet. The highlights were my husband's Moroccan meatballs and his cherry, almond soda. I don't even like soda, but I drank all of his. SO good! We asked if there were cinnamon rolls left from brunch for dessert. The server was told there weren't but said he would check anyway. He came back with a cinnamon roll the size of my head smothered in caramel. It was melt-in-your-mouth heaven.  Atmosphere: Great music and intimate- inside and out. I'm excited to go back for dinner, because I bet its beautiful on their patio at night.",

When my medium-well burger came out bleeding, I sent it back to be cooked more.  I like my steaks medium, but I can't have a bleeding burger!  Well, the whole thing was put into whatever they used to reheat it (supposedly they have no microwave so I dunno what they use).  The lettuce came back soggy and the bread came back hard and a little burnt.  Everything else we had was fantastic, though.  And the restaurant was exactly my style.  So, I decided to give it a shot at dinner the next night.    Boy, am I glad I did.    I ordered the Roasted Salmon Superfood dish and I was in HEAVEN.  Honestly, this is my favorite dish at any restaurant in town.    St. Francis is now part of my regular rotation.  I mostly stick with the Superfood dish, but I have tried the following sides: fingerling potatoes, baked goat cheese, wood roasted seasonal vegetables, the baguette.  They are all delicious.    The roasted chicken is delicious, as well!  Run to St. Francis and sit down a while.  If you don't like it, well... stop reading my reviews!  P.S. Kids under 10 eat FREE.  Fantastic.",

The waitress conveniently finally came to take our order at 6:01 after happy hour was over. Oh well, I wasn't paying or I would've spoke up. I got the \"green bean salad\" which was green beans a few peach slices and a few hazelnuts. The color made me think mayo and even though the waitress said it was a vinaigrette originally, I couldn't get her to come back for another 15 minutes and couldn't eat it-- not a mayo eater. Whatever it was I didn't like it. My mom and I had to switch \"entrees\" if you want to call it that. It was a side of veggies. Definitely needed a bread crumb finish or something more than a veggie side, but maybe that was the hidden mayo dressing. Not the best service or food tonight but I usually love this place. I usually get the fingerling potatoes or forbidden rice veggie dish.. Won't differ from the norm next time. Anyways I come for the alcohol and bread. Will be back",

There has always been this exciting vibe especially on Sunday mornings with crowds of people waiting for a seat, people sitting at the patio bar having drinks, live jazz music filling the place with sound. As we walked to the front door my wife and I looked at each other because there was practically no one there. Nobody waiting for a seat, nobody sitting at the patio bar and no live Jazz music. It is 9:50 am. We sit and my wife asks for coffee. She takes one sip and makes a face. She adds milk and sugar and takes another sip, pushes the coffee away and says it's not drinkable. I order the Quinoa Bowl and my wife orders Eggs Benedict with Avocado . My Quinoa was cold, not room temperature but cold. I ask my waiter if it was supposed to be hot and he says no it is served room temperature. It was COLD. My wifes EB did not look appetizing on the plate. It had very little avocado and very little hollandaise on it. The english muffin tasted off. We both looked at each other confused because as I said we have been here many other times and have always been pleased with the food. The waiter did comp my meal and my wife's coffee and we will give St. Francis another try because we have had so many good meals there. I sure hope this was just an off day.",

    "text": "Saw this place on DDD and wanted to check it out.  Went with some friends for brunch on a Saturday.  Yes, the forced valet parking is a bit of a pain, but the spaces are very tightly packed together and so this way you are not going to get blocked in or anything - if you want to eat here you are going to have to suck it up/deal with it.  We ordered the onion burger; the chicken salad sandwich and the pork with green chile.  The burger looked good (and was cooked to the requested level of done-ness - a dying art) but my two dining guests said you couldn't taste the onions (I didn't try it), which is disappointing as the word \"onion\" is in its description.  The fries that came with it were excellent - I would want a side of those to myself.  The chicken salad sandwich wasn't great - the bread it was between (house made in the wood fired oven I assume) had clearly been burnt and then the burned parts scraped off (you could see the knife marks on top of the sandwich.  The chicken was clearly \"hand pulled\" as it had a random size and good flavor, but there was way too much mayo for me - it was kind of a sloppy joe style chicken salad.  I got the house salad as a side (before I tried the fries) and asked for the buttermilk dressing on the side.  The dressing never showed up and when I asked the server for it I kind of got some \"attitude\" like I was being difficult.  The green chile pork was the best dish of the three - great flavor (we got the egg on top) and consistency.  It wasn't the world's largest portion, but it was very good.  So why only 2 stars, well I think the prices charged a little high, the service wasn't great and there were issues/disappointment with two of the three entrees we ordered.  They sell their house made bread (for a reasonable $3 a loaf), but nearly all of those looked burnt and so after my sandwich experience I decided not to take one to go.",

For starters, we had the Crispy Fingerling Potatoes. Huge pile of not so crispy potatoes. Kinda flavorless, unless doused in ketchup or the other white sauce the came with. We made a point to our server if we could have our entrees after we finished our first glass of wine and our appetizer. She said they do everything by courses so it would be no issues. Five minutes after our appetizer arrived, our salmon and salad was placed in front of us. Talk about rushing your customers. Seriously sucked. We shared the salmon super food, which was a bowl, and the kale, pear and goat cheese salad. Both were mediocre and my husband and I jokingly agreed we would have a better food at the chipotle across the street. While we were eating, the bussers kept stopping by trying to remove our plates.  Mediocre food, rushing your customers, with so many restaurants in the north central corridor, we definitely can do better. An awesome server cannot make up for all the other faults.",

Upon entering, the atmosphere seemed trendy.  It was artistic, musical, and modern mixed into one awesomely multi-functional space.  I loved the music they played - electro-swing, neo -soul, conscience/revolutionary hip-hop, and jazzy pop.   The service was great.  Our server (OH NO I FORGOT HER NAME!!) was very fun loving and friendly.  For us new comers she gave us some awesome brunch suggestions.  Of all days... I wasn't very hungry (UGH!) so i grabbed a soup and salad.  I don't like anything pumpkin - not even pumpkin pie so I was a bit skeptical when our server suggested pumpkin soup.  I'm so glad she did because it was OHmazing!  It had a very light pumpkin taste to it, but it was more like a butternut squash.  I loved the pom seeds.  It gave bursts of tartness to round out the flavor of the soup in your mouth.   The salad was light yet flavorful.  The apples gave it a refreshing taste.  I had a pineapple sparkling lemonade and that was not okay. lol   It was too tart for me.  Yikes!    Aside from the drink, I have to give this place a 5.  It went above and beyond my expectations.  I loved the atmosphere, my food was on point.  Service was great.... I rarely hit a spot twice (there are so many other places I've gotta check out!), but I will definitely be back to try dinner (if it isn't closed when I'm there!)",

I refuse to eat bacon that has been charred to a crisp, not sure why you would even serve that. Did not seem like high quality bacon anyway. Thin, cheap run of the mill bacon. The vegan bowl was just barely ok. I ordered it because I was hoping for a healthy portion of vegetables. Instead it had very few vegetables, the most plentiful of which was potatoes! Served on plain quinoa, no sauce, no flavor. Blah. Daughter's pancake off of kids menu tasted really bad as if it were cooked in burnt oil in the skillet. Also it had chocolate chips in it which I did not see on the menu, but maybe I just missed that. Rather than serving the syrup on the side it came with the syrup right on it. Have never seen this, but not a fan.",

I guess it's hard not to believe the hype because they were on Triple D (Guy Fiery) and several articles were written about them and great reviews on Yelp.  First tip... Don't sit in the back, you will just be forgotten about... We started off with there Corn Soup witch was actually really good and the Moroccan Meatballs, also very good but more than one piece of bread should come with several Meatballs. Next up was the French Onion burger and that's were the you know what hit the fan.   The restaurant started to get really busy and we were stuck in the back... Waiter started to get crazy busy and completely forgot about us. When he finally came back we asked what's up with our burger taking so long... His response was that it came out of two kitchens so one part was taking longer than the other. . . ??!?!   We decided to get a cheese flatbread that was meh... Ended up wrapping everything up and getting out of a place that just serves your basic restaurant food. It's nothing fancy and you should probably try another place.  Now I'm sure the owner or who ever has been the manager at this place for fifteen minutes will try to respond to this review and want to make everything better but there's really no need. Just creep cranking out that crappy service.",

    "text": "Had planned to meet up with Yelp buds Angela T and Kurdy S before my last visit to AZ.  Kurdy suggested meeting up at this place for dinner on a Friday night.  Learned that it had been featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and I think I vaguely remember seeing that episode. I have been to several restaurants I have seen featured on this show and the food is not always as great as Guy Fieri makes them seem, so was hoping this wasn't the case here.   Glad my friends had made reservations for us as this place was pretty busy later on a Friday night.  They offer complimentary valet for parking here down the side driveway to the left of the restaurant.    There is a patio area up front and a bar to the left side upon entering and dining area in back of restaurant and seating upstairs. The restaurant is modern and open and pretty packed with tables in the dining area we were sat in.  Out waitress was friendly and helpful in explaining menu items to us.  Had ordered some of the things featured on the TV show to see if they stood out or not.    Their bar drink menu consisted of wine, draft, can and bottled beer, and specialty cocktails.  I wanted a cocktail on this warm Phoenix evening, so I opted for the Cucumber Cooler.  This was gin, muddle cucumber and freshly squeezed lemonade.  This was delicious and really refreshing.  I enjoyed all the components of this drink ;)  The seasonal menu is American cuisine and they state that they pride themselves on using quality ingredients.  My friends ordered the bread that this restaurant is famous for.  This was warm and freshly made and tasty.  Our table ended up getting several things and kinda sharing. I think I am remembering correctly, but am not sure if I got everything as we were chatting a lot and I might have forgotten to take pictures of something.  I do have pictures of the Heirloom Tomato with Burrata Cheese, Cucumbers and Garlic Toast, Mussels and Chorizo, The Moroccan Meatballs and the Pig Dip.  The Pig Dip was roasted pork loin, bacon, pork jus, onion marmalade,dijon and Gruyere on a baguette.  This was one of the things featured on the show.  I thought this was pretty good but not one of the my favorites of the evening.  I would have to say that the Moroccan Meatballs and Chorizo and Clams stood out more as more flavorful dishes.  The meatballs were ample-sized and in a nicely spiced tomato sauce with cheese, pearl pasta and garlic toast.  These were unique and very tasty.  I am a girl who loves her bivalves, so I never pass up a dish with clams or mussels.  The Mussels and Chorizo were outstanding.  The tomato broth had added flavor from the slightly spicy chorizo and were delicious with the mussels.  The St. Francis bread was tasty to use to sop up this yummy broth.   Service by staff was friendly and attentive.  Tables are packed pretty tight on the main floor of the dining area and it was very crowded on the Friday evening we were there.  I would highly recommend making a reservation at this place and am glad that my friends had done so for us. St. Francis was a nice place to meet up for good food and drink and catch up with my friends in the heart of Phoenix.",

The pork chili had great flavor but the meat was over cooked and the kale & apple salad they tried to serve us had old greens. The salad had no flavor and the greens were so old they weren't green, but rather turning yellow. I would have been embarrassed to serve the salad at my home to a guest. We sent the salad back.

    "text": "St. Francis is one of the most consistent local spots in Phoenix that cranks out some fun seasonal food! Worth a visit if you're thinking about it. Here is why!  Why go there: We sat at the chef's bar where we got to watch the magic of a well run brigade. The guys (and girl) were in sync and communicating like a good kitchen should. They are led well back there, even when things got sticky, they pushed forward. We watched the food get sent out immaculately under the eye of the night's head chef at the pass. The food at St. Francis is accented by their wood fired oven, where you'll get all their flatbreads, roasted veggies, chicken, cornbread and freshly baked bread coming out of. Even the deserts. The menu is fresh, seasonal and generous in portions, from starters to mains.   Don't miss: Their fingerling potatoes were unbelievable, served with fresh rosemary and sage that went for a swim in the deep fryer before hitting the plate topped with paper thin Parmesan shavings and served with a lemon aioli. Anything with fresh garden veg is amazingly fresh, the chef's special pot roast was outstanding. Their flatbreads were great out of that wood fire oven. So hard to choose from their menu, though it is condensed!  Tip:  The place is the largest, if you can sneak in do so early and grab the chef table (oven bar) could seat 3-4 and watch the magic go down.   Overall:  One of the best in Phoenix, we got a freshly baked bread to take home to the sitter! A good thank you from where we just dined!",

The swordfish was not tasty, particularly gamey and the flavors were all over the place.  What was once an inclusive atmosphere where the quality of food and beverage was the focus has become an exclusive atmosphere devoid of substance on a customer and experience level.",

Was disappointed. Bread and Jam appetizer was recommended and it's a joke they actually charge anything for 5 small slices of French bread with butter and some jam.  Daughter thought her Salmon Benedict was ok and wife liked her frittata. I had the French Onion burger and it was really bad. I love burgers and ate half of it because I was starving. The entire time I questioned the meat because it didn't taste like beef. Too mushy, not seasoned and served raw. Returned the rest and to their credit they didn't charge. But why wouldn't the manager on duty come out and investigate. Easy to write off the food, but more effective to come out and try to make it right. Overall just disappointing and somewhere I can't see myself ever going to again.",

You will have to check it out for yourself I'm not telling why. teehee! Hamburger good, pork chili good. Chocolate peanut butter Gelato cake better! LOL! Nothing to go crazy over but worth a trip.

Their menu is super interesting and everything I have had is delicious, though I have only had one thing because it is so delicious I get it every time.  I usually get the chicken which has green olives.  Also it has a very kind of swank, trendy feel without the least bit of pretension which makes it very nice.  This is demonstrated by how super kid friendly the place is!  There is even a box of toys that your toddler can play with and one time when we went there the hosts practically babysitted our daughter, playing with her at the toy box.  It is so nice to go to a very grown up kind of resturaunt where they welcome children so throughoughly.",

Picture the meatball entree as three small tennis ball sized meatballs in a red sauce- seasoning has a delicious Mediterranean/Asian spiced twist.  Although the menu stated this entree comes with pearl pasta we literally searched for it in the dish- our mistake for thinking this was an Italian style meal. My salmon superfood entree was perfectly cooked and yummy. The broccoli with aioli dish brought me back to Pulp Fiction \"French fries with mayo in holland ...they drowned them.\"  Service could have been more attentive....busy place and great spot for outdoor patio dining on a warm June night!",

In Phoenix no one has blended the two as tastefully as St. Francis.   The ambiance is hip without being exclusive.  The building itself is very open and worth the trip in and of itself.  The menu, while small, is loaded with dishes that will hook you and ensure return visits.   As a starter I'd recommend the Pumpkin soup.  I'm still trying to come up with an adequate superlative to describe the exhilaration I felt when that first spoonful made contact with my tastebuds.  The flavorful festival continues with the Green Chile Pork.  The dish itself is somewhat small but surprisingly hearty.  And cap off the evening with a desert, preferably in the form of the sticky toffee pudding. This place does the city proud and is one more shining light in a re- surging central corridor.",

    "text": "I've heard a lot of buzz about St. Francis and was eager to try it because I am always on the lookout for new restaurants in CenPho. I was not disappointed. This restaurant design and layout is as fantastic as the food and service.   The Spot:  Located on 1st and Camelback this gorgeous building boasts original brick walls and polished concrete floors downstairs. I had inquired about the upstairs and my server let me sneak a peak, the floor upstairs is made of cork, very unique and gorgeous. The contemporary design really stands out. There is a support system of cable and pin settings, which do away with support columns (so said my dining partner), and it creates a very open and airy flow.  The women's restroom has an original safe built in to the wall with the handle acting as a toilet paper roll. The bar opens to both the restaurant and the patio so giving diners a sense of comfort. There are also pop out windows, so you are able to see in to the kitchen from almost any spot. Currently only the downstairs is open, with plans to open the upstairs within a few months. (The upstairs would be a great place to have a big birthday dinner, seating about 40). The patio wraps around the restaurant and will provide additional seating once the weather cools off a bit.  The Chef: Aaron Chamberlin was part of the opening team for some of my favorite restaurants in the valley: Chelsea's Kitchen, LGO and Radio Milano. He has over 20 years of experience and his French/Mediterranean training helps him to create phenomenal dishes, with top quality ingredients. The kitchen has a brick chamber used for roasting meats, vegetables and breads. The oven and selected spices really brought out the flavor in each dish.   The Food: The menus will change seasonally to take advantage of the ripest produce Arizona has to offer. The current menu incorporates local ingredients such as Arizona pistachios, honey and goat cheese from Black Mesa Ranch. St. Francis is one of only a handful of restaurants that are able to use rare herbs from Sonoma.   Last night I started with the baked goat cheese with walnut herb pesto and toasted bread, it was absolutely delicious. The cheese and walnuts were so fresh I had to go easy not to ruin my appetite for dinner.  For my main I had the pepper-crusted flat iron steak with creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes covered in a red wine reduction.  The steak was phenomenal; it was so tender I could cut it with a fork. I was also pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed the creamed spinach.  Desert was also amazing; I went with the summer fruit trifle as it seemed a lighter dish. It had strawberries, peaches, raspberries and some other berry I couldn't nail down, all surrounded in a light cream topped with toasted almonds. It was heaven.  The Service:  The server was awesome. She explained the philosophy of the restaurant along with the vision of the chef. She was quick to point out her favorite meals and her parents were seated next to us. It was nice to see so many friends and family in a newly opened spot.   This place will become a part of my regular restaurant rotation in CenPho. Quality ingredients, wonderful layout and educated staff make this a 5 star review.",

First of all, I love, love, loved the setup of the place and the overall feel inside. There is also a patio that is outside, but opens up to the restaurant, which I thought was very cool and unique. The service we had was great, very attentive and helpful in answering our questions about the menu.   Since there were several of us there that night, I got to try a number of the entrees. I personally had the green chili pork, which I have still been thinking about a month later. It was so comforting and really really tasty. My Husband had the burger, which he also really liked and I tried... it was very good. Some others at the table had pizzas and the corn one especially was quite good.   All in all, I really liked St. Francis and cannot wait to go back some other time and try more of their unique, local products menu!",

    "text": "Walking up the gently lit side corridor was an inviting prelude to the entry with a side peak of the open air indoor/oudoor bar that has a gorgeous illuminated onyx bar top.  The layout is quite nice, and  certainly is a place Phoenicians can be proud of.   Beautiful surface materials abound, which are a perfect example of how restraining architectural details allow the visitor to really appreciate the space and the dining experience.  I respect that Aaron Chamberlin candidly admits that the menu is still growing,  wine list being tweaked, and more dessert items shall be added.  I adore restaurants that have an evolving menu that incorporate seasonal ingredients and the chef's favorite food ensembles of the moment.  We shared a refreshing salad with chilled corn, radish, mini heirlooms with a  decadent homemade butter cream ranch dressing.  Plenty for 2, and very reasonably priced at $8.  Oh yeah, and there is a bread service!  The corn chowder was not to our tastes, but the Halibut with eggplant and green and yellow string beans was divine, and perfectly prepared.  I can't provide a technical description of the dessert, expect for it was like a toffee bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla gelato on top.  YUM!  They serve Cartel Coffee (Tempe), which is quite delicious, is and another locally owned spot, that I encourage everyone to try.  The service was absolutely stellar!  Our waiter was well-informed, attentive, and really let us take our time and enjoy ourselves.   St. Francis is a welcome, and much needed newcomer to the ever expanding Central Phoenix dining experience.",

The bread they serve is to die for - I bought and took home two loaves for my family. They wrap it cutely in paper and a straw string. You just need to make sure you put it in a ziploc type bag when you get home to soften it a bit, otherwise it's a brick. Just a tad sour without it being straight sourdough bread. YUM.",

    "text": "We read so many good reviews on Yelp that we had to try this place. We took the light rail and arrived around 830pm Saturday night.   The place looked very promising with its modern indoor/outdoor blended setup. It was a full house but not too packed. We waited around 20 minutes for a table which was passed with a round of drinks from the bar. This is where the downhill slide began. A Plum Blossom was ordered from the cocktail menu. It was so sugary, it really was totally undrinkable. The two Kiltlifters ordered came with about an inch and a half to spare to the top, as if someone took some sips on the way from the bar. The glass of house white was barely acceptable.   During our wait we had time to study the menu and decided the pumpkin soup and pepper crusted flat iron steaks would be ordered by at least two in our party. Little did we know until seated that they were out of the flat iron steak which left very limited options.   With pumpkin soup on the way along with a burger, the roasted chicken, and a flatbread, we still had high hopes.   The pumpkin soup was brought quickly. The plate was burning hot and the soup ice cold with a hardened film covering the top. We would have sent it back but our entrees arrived so soon after there  wasn't time. Apparently they pre-pour and use heat lamps.   The flat bread was just so so...very dry. The chicken was nothing to write home about. The burger was super well done (ordered medium well) and very dry. The menu states that it comes with a choice of sides but when we asked our waitress she stated that it only comes with fries.   A bottle of Patz&Hall Pinot Noir was ordered for the table. Normally we love Pinot's but this one was awful. It was much too harsh.   By the end of the meal we had had enough. Dessert was offered but we politely passed.   Maybe we are the sole recipients of a bad meal as the star ratings on here are very high. But in our opinion, Postino's and Maizes have nothing to worry about if this is the best St. Francis can offer.   On the plus side, there was a very entertaining crowd. The women's  bathroom was occupied by a frolicking couple so all in our party had the opportunity to digest the provocative corral art in the men's room.   Normally this place would deserve nothing better than a single star but it gets two as the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was worth something.",

    "text": "Brunch with the ladies on a Sunday. Place gets crowded, so you'll need a reservation- you can have mine. Not impressed by the vegan breakfast bowl. The server told me they were out of chickpeas, so substituted avocado instead. She failed to tell me they were also out of spinach and tomatoes, which were the other two ingredients listed on the menu. It came with a flavorless saute of oily celery, carrots, and red pepper. This dish was really terrible. Like diet food gone wrong. Maybe a bit of seasoning or a sauce wold have helped? Can't blame the server on the mixed up breakfast dish, and she was very friendly so bumping up from a 1 star meal. Too many other good brunch places in town to waste a meal on this one.",

Unfortunately that was about 3 owners ago. I'm not sure what's going on with this place but I visited last night with a friend after not having been for about a year and was terribly disappointed. I ordered a favorite the margarita flatbread. This was a St Francis staple and always delicious with homemade bread and fresh cheeses. Last night it compared to little Caesar's. Greasy cheese and cardboard crust. I sent that back for the Forbidden rice. Also another favorite. It was bland with tons of pepper to keep your mouth so hot your taste buds died. My friend ordered the nochi. He said it was bland but the salmon he added was good. My Forbidden rice and his nochi cost us $52. They have raised their prices and skimped on their food   It's off my list. I will say our server was excellent. Don't remember his name, tall black guy. He was very good. He was about the only good thing...",

It's been a really long time since I've been so I was so excited to go back with a group and I was sorely disappointed. Nothing about the experience was the same as before. My favorite dish: the Moroccan meatballs, were the complete opposite of how I remember. I read a lot of reviews saying the owners had changed but I really hoped this classics had remained the same. Sad to report it was very different. We had a big party and I would say only one person of the large group was happy with their food. They were known for their wood fired dishes, amazing drinks, and incredible ambiance. However, when I walked in I could instantly tell it was different. Bright lights, no staff there to greet us, mismatched chairs and overall a lack luster experience.",

Service was good.  The restaurant was empty when we got there, which seemed like a bad sign, but it was great.  Guy Fieri said the Pig Dip was one of his top five dip sandwiches of all time.....I don't think I liked it quite as much as he did, but it was good.  Although, the one lame part was a sprite cost three dollars (a bit high, and it was a for a kid so I wish it was included in the price of a kids meal) and a lemonade out of the same fountain machine cost four dollars.  There was nothing else in the lemonade, so not sure why it cost four bucks.",

We ordered drinks first, the Santa Rosa and Cucumber Cooler, and were impressed with both, aesthetically pleasing, great flavors, and very refreshing. Off of their Signature Items menu, we ordered the Pork Green Chile and the Moroccan Meatballs for dinner, both were very flavorful and different from other run of the mill restaurant fare.",

I felt like that price point was a little high even though it was locally sourced. I will probably come back again though just because the ambiance was amazing. Service was also on point",

    "text": "I had super high hopes for this place as it has been on my 'try' list for awhile and I know a lot of people that love it.  I feel like overall it was a pretty good experience minus a few minor details (gave it 4 stars but it's more like 3.5).  I like the ambiance.  The patio is super cool, cozy and large at the same time, with a very cool fireplace.  As far as food, everything we had was fairly tasty-the best items being the Crispy Fingerling Potatoes and the Pumpkin Soup (outstanding).  We happened to be there at happy hour and they've recently changed their menu a bit and it's a little limited at HH time.  We also tried the Moroccan Meatballs which were ok, lacking some flavor (I make them at home and mine are better) and could've used a little salt.  I had a glass of their house made sangria which wasn't that great.  It had no fruit.  It wasn't sweet at all.  I don't like sweet 'wines' but I was craving sangria which is usually sweeter.  Perhaps it would taste better on a hot day. It's very cool that kids eat free. However, the offerings aren't super kid friendly, in my opinion.  Personally, I am anti kid-meal and my kiddos typically split a pasta that is on the regular menu (or something similar).  Well, that's not an option here so we ordered the hamburger and the baked pasta off the kiddie menu for them.  The burger was huge but the bun was massive and hard to eat (fries were yummy though), and the pasta wasn't good at all.  It's a pearl pasta so it is a weird texture (my kids are foodies but they didn't like it) and the sauce didn't have much flavor.  So, while I appreciate the thought, perhaps the kids meals could be slightly more tailored to kid's tastes.  I know I shouldn't complain about something free, and as mentioned I am not wanting boxed mac n cheese but a couple other simple choices would be nice. Only other slight complaint is the service was super slow.  It was HH and not busy at all so I'm not sure if everyone was just in a super chill-ax'ing mood or what, but it took forever to place our order! All in all, I would return because there are a couple other menu items I would like to try but I'm not in any rush.",

Service was extremely slow, in fact our waitress disappeared for long periods of time and I had to flag down other servers to get refills, ask questions, and even try to find out where our food was. Not that it's the restaurants fault, but apparently it was prom season and we were seated in the midst of a large group of very loud high school kids. The food was good, but not great, and definitely worth the prices they are charging. Overall, it seems like the buzz around this place is overblown for the reality of the experience. I probably won't be back.",

    "text": "Charlie Chaplin stumbling around, being clumsy making dough.   Walking up to this cute and quaint restaurant, I noticed they're playing silent old flicks on one of the patio walls via projector. The ambiance is really sweet, romantic. I'm not sure if it's valet only, but when you pull into the parking lot they do offer free valet if eating in the restaurant. It was pretty busy for a Wednesday night. My date and I were seated at a small table in the middle of the restaurant. We noticed a heavy, chilly draft coming from the two glass doors that were open to the patio.   Upon sitting down, we realize it's a bit too much so my date asks the hostess Kaitlyn (sp.) if we could be moved or if something could be done about it. No apologies were made at this time and all she said was it would be another 20-25 minutes of a wait in order to be moved. My date and I were pretty hungry, as it was around 7PM already by this time so we decided to stay put (not very happy about it tho). Ryan was our server. He noticed how cold I looked and said sorry, that he'll try and make the experience more enjoyable with his service. He recommended some food items, said their Moroccan Meatballs were featured on a Food Network show. They also have drinks on their list that are made in Arizona, as well as out, but I thought that was pretty cool.  We order the Goat Cheese appetizer, which was pretty good. We proceeded to order the Moroccan Meatballs and the Forbidden Rice Bowl. It took the usual time to come out, didn't have to wait long. In the meantime, my date and I are trying to stay distracted due to the chilly breeze coming through... noticing the table next to us is feeling the same thing. The entrees we ordered are pretty good. The meatballs weren't amazing, they were definitely different, but not as up to the hype as I expected. The Forbidden Rice Bowl is a dish to try - it tasted a bit too saucy though, but otherwise good. Water took a little bit to get refilled a few times, my date sat with an empty glass for about 15 minutes at one point.... Tsk tsk.  Halfway through the meal, a female server closes one of the glass doors to the patio that stops the chilly draft coming through. Of course we're already almost finished and the dining room is starting to clear out a bit, so damage was already done. My date and I both couldn't finish our meals, so we asked for boxes. Ryan boxes them up for us and I notice him and another employee smirking to each other while placing my little bit of rice into the to-go box..... Not sure what that was about, but okay. So I don't want to waste forbidden rice.... Why does that call for a smirk face?!  All in all, I give the food 4 Stars, the service started out good but towards the end not so great therefore I give 3 Stars total. I don't think I plan on going back to try this place again.",

Seating is available indoors or on the heated patio with additional seating upstairs. Service was great and also accommodating in our request to stay warm but not too warm as we chose to dine outdoors braving a cool AZ evening. It's great place to join friends, is family friendly(as they paid special attention to my daughter's cherry filled drink)and is a cozy enough location for a date. I ordered the pork chili verde, topped with perfectly cooked sunny side up eggs, and a spicy roasted jalapeno, amazing! Being with a friends whom generously shared, I was able to try a bite of the large tasty meatballs, and the pumpkin soup that was like eating a sweet whipped into perfection bite of dessert.

    "text": "Wow has this place come into its own in the past 4-5 years.  I came here a few times for happy hour when it first opened and enjoyed the atmosphere and the drink specials but wasn't bowled over by the menu.  Funnily enough, it was an episode of Diners, Drive Ins and Dives (I know, I hate that guy too, but it's how I get my American food fix in London) that introduced me to what I would later become obsessed with: that cast iron, wood fired pancake. When it came time to plan my next visit home, I put that shit in my itinerary: Friday, visit grandma and lunch with dad; Saturday, cast iron pancake @St Francis. That's how serious I was about this pancake. Finally, the glorious day came and we arrived at opening time for Saturday brunch (sneaked past the valet who weren't quite set up yet and parked right out front, too!) Settled on the lovely covered patio with it's grape leaves that let just the right amount of sunshine flow through and got to business. Bloody mary ($9 ... ouch), biscuits and gravy ($12) and announced to my friends we'd be splitting the pancake for dessert (I needed my biscuit fix, too!) Fellow diners got the egg sandwich ($10 and one of the cheapest option on the breakfast menu) and the eggs benedict ($13). It took forever for our order to come out. I had to order another bloody mary (considering the price, it was not an easy decision to make), but the air was fine and we had no where to be. Finally, it arrived and was so, so happy. Dreams = fulfilled. The bill came to a whopping 72 (not including tip!) and they could have been a bit more apologetic about the wait and more upfront with updates from the kitchen, but I'll forgive them because PANCAKE.",

    "text": "St. Francis has some of the yummiest food! Their burgers are just about the best I've ever had. In fact, they've won awards for their French Onion burger (amazing beef topped with bacon, gruyere cheese and a house made French onion dip...drool!) The fingerling potatoes are out of this world too. It is served with fried sage and rosemary and let me tell you, I picked every piece of fried herb out of that dish and ate it. Who knew deep fried fresh herbs were so delectable? And their Pig Dip sandwich...oh yeah!  My absolute favourite dish is their Roasted Salmon Superfood. Perfectly seasoned and seared salmon served in a bowl of quinoa, radish, spinach and avocado and then dressed in a delicious chili dressing. It is the perfect combination of taste, texture and visual beauty. They also have daily specials, which are usually spot on. I try to strike a balance between trying their specials and ordering my usual favourites.    The service is always just fine; friendly attentive staff but not overbearing.  Even though the place is usually really busy when we arrive, it isn't overly loud inside, which is something I appreciate. I like having a conversation over my meal and sometimes in a popular spot, that isn't always possible.  Oh, and I love that they often serve locally grown/produced vegetables, meat and herbs.   The location is convenient; just east of Central on Camelback. St. Francis takes reservations (I use Open Table) but you can also walk in and usually get a seat without too big of a wait.  My ONLY complaint about St. Francis is that you can only park via valet. Generally I don't mind valet parking (in fact, I'm lazy enough to prefer it!) but I like to have the option, especially when the valet attendant only has to park my car three steps from the door. The valet stand is further from the door than my car usually is! Valet parking is free but of course you feel like a heel if you don't at least give them a tip so in a sense, it costs to park for your meal. I'd prefer to make the choice of either parking my own car and walking the three steps to the door or having valet park my car and then walking 10 steps to the door. Makes no sense. But then the food is totally worth it so....you decide!",

Next was a pork belly pozole - very tasty and satisfying.  The dessert was a toffee pudding, but it was more of a \"cake with ice cream on top of a toffee base\" than a pudding.  It was still great.  Next time I must try the trifle... Beautiful decor and a cozy atmosphere.",

We sampled our way through appetizers of Mediterranean style meatballs, veggie flatbread, and goat cheese baked with fresh tomatoes. All were spectacular. Dinner salad was crisp and fresh, and the polenta was creamy good. Hubby had the risotto which was a bit salty to my palate, but appropriately creamy. Our friends had the salmon which was moist and flavorful, and the black rice shrimp bowl which was tangy and tasty. The only bummer was the chocolate cake. The gelato it came with was superb, but the cake was so dry. Sorry. We will definitely be back. Maybe the sticky toffee pudding next time....",

It's crispy on the outside, juicy and tender chicken, yummy broccolini. The farro is a little out of place, but who cares! It is THAT GOOD!     Also had the romaine hearts salad with endive, bacon, apples. This will be another lunch visit for sure.  Has just the right amount of sweet, savory, creaminess and crunch. The apples are cut up very nicely as slices and julienned in the salad. The full portion fed 3 of us a small salad.  We also tried the pot roast which was very rich and decadent, almost like a short rib. It came on a creamy polenta which made it even more rich. It also has a few bok choy on the side as well. I love bok choy :) Overall good, but I'm glad we ordered a bunch of things and shared, because, it was a little heavy to eat all by yourself.  Everything doesn't compete with the chicken though.   And 3rd, we got our stand by the french onion burger, which was good as usual.   I also love the blackboard near  the back door that has the list of their seasonal fruits, vegetables, herbs that they use in their dishes.  If you eat here for dinner trust me, you have got to order the Chicken!",

I had chicken added for protein-the dish came to the table so fresh-with perfectly cooked veggies in season, the rice was beyond tasty and the shredded chicken the perfect compliment. The real star is the sauce-delicate,aromatic, light. I ate most of it for lunch then took home the leftover and and had a light dinner. I never eat the same thing twice in a day but this is the type f dish I could eat weekly. Thinking about going back soon...",

He had ordered a mushroom omelet for me but now knowing that omelets are probably the last thing I would order at a restaurant for breakfast.  I am not a huge fan of them normally but will eat them if I am hungry.  Before the food came out we had ordered a Bloody Mary which was so good.  I had seen a few different ways that people had ordered them with some muddled lemons and limes and was jealous mine didn't come that way to try.  Mine was still amazing don't get me wrong I just wish I would have seen that before ordering one for myself.    When we had received our food we both dug in and was I in shock! I instantly thought when I received my food that I would need a condiment of some sort for my eggs but boy was I wrong. It was so good the way they had prepared them you absolutely don't need anything besides your drinks.  I can't say I will order them again because I definitely would love to try the rest of the menu for sure. But the omelet was solid and a good choice if you Love omelets.  While I was half way through eating my omelet I tried the slices of toast that came with it and was blown away again at just how amazing that was. I also happened to try my boyfriends corn bread that came with his dish and was probably drooling from how delicious that was!  I am slightly nervous the next time I get to order my own meal and for more of their home made bread because I will probably look like an idiot with how in love I am with their homemade breads already.  We had put one last order in for the Johnny Appleseed drink in which was also to die for was definitely a dangerous drink to say the least.  Next time I will definitely have to try the mimosas and peach Bellini's.    Oh St.Francis why do you have to tempt me the way you do and be so far away from our place.",

From simple food (the burger is the best burger I've had in my life, I swear), to brunch (the baked eggs is excellent, as is the mushroom and goat cheese omelet), to dinner or lunch (the chile verde is to die for!).  I read somewhere that the pudding desert ($7) is one of the top 100 dishes in the valley.  It's not huge, but perfect blend of flavors and gelato and just a 10 out of 10 desert.  Honestly, I'd eat here weekly if I wasn't afraid of growing tired of the food.  Ultra modern decor, clean, free valet, friendly owner/chef, and the most kid-friendly super fancy restaurant I've ever seen.  Anyway, I'm usually tough on restaurants, but this is my favorite place to eat, and I have a hard time imagining anyone could be disappointed for giving it a try.",

The menu piqued my interest since it offered a variety of healthy options and curious flavor pairings. I ended up with a salad that had nuts, beets and avocado, and I added chicken. it was perfect!   My coworker ordered cauliflower soup which sounded unappetizing not only because I dislike that veggie, but because it was 113 degrees Fahrenheit outside. Even so, I was coerced into trying the soup and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  My one complaint is I was sitting next to a sign that said something about St. Francis having the best bread in Phoenix, but I never got a bread basket to see what the hype was about!

My opinion wasn't too far off as far as the air of hipster/yuppiness that exudes through the vestibule definitely screams Postino's while you wait for a table but as far as quality of service, you St. Francis, are definitely no Postino's.   Our server made a major push at the upsell of a combination appetizer and when we agreed to it, he forgot to bring it to us! I had ordered a soup/salad/1/2 sandwich entree for lunch, and he forgot the soup. When he did bring it after being reminded, it was lukewarm. He kept forgetting to bring refills as well. It was like he was in another world. We ended up being comped quite a bit off of our bill because of simple mistakes because what's the point in being served lukewarm soup or an appetizer at the end of your meal? And he was NOT new! I am very forgiving of new servers and this guy kept telling us how he's worked at St. Francis for 2 years and how much he loves it there....so whatever his problem was that day, it definitely affected our meal and our potential to return.  The saving grace was that the food was really delicious. I had the Del Real sandwich, my son had pig dip, my other \"son\" had French Onion burger, my \"son's girlfriend had the forbidden rice bowl. All were really nicely done, fresh, served at the right temperatures (with the exception of the aforementioned soup), etc. I just wish the service had been better.   Maybe we'll go back..maybe I'll just go to Postino's. I guess we'll see the next time we are \"in the neighborhood.\"",

The food for all our in our party was just over spiced.  Each of our dinners just tasted like spice and not so much the meat or other entree it ordered.  When ordering meatballs (no pasta, just had the meatballs), I kind of expect to be able to taste the meat.  Plus the garlic bread served with it was so hard, it was uneatable.

Granted, they had regular coffee, but not everyone drinks regular coffee. Someone did a poor job in their ordering department, but I wonder what would have kept them from running across the street to AJ's and just buying a few pounds of decaf? I realize that it would not be their usual Cartel Coffee, but wouldn't it have solved the problem, at least for the morning brunch crowd?  Also, I wonder if they changed the recipe for their otherwise excellent baked eggs in tomato sauce? Two of the four of us ordered it and it was runny.  Finally, while our table was trying to have a conversation, we were interrupted constantly asking if we wanted more water or more coffee. Repeatedly, we told the wait staff we were fine, but to no avail. Their staff need to somehow communicate to each other; I have not experienced this at other restaurants so I have to assume that other restaurants have some communication system in place to keep this from happening?  We will be back again since most of our visits to St. Francis are excellent but I do wish that they paid more attention to detail!",

Whenever my wife makes soup, she asks me to bring home a loaf of crusty french bread. This is where I go to get it. Don't get me wrong, all their food is delicious, especially the veggie lasagna, and some kind of melted goat cheese in spaghetti sauce appy, but I don't have time for that, not tonight. My orders were very specific, \"a loaf of crusty french bread.\"  When you arrive, there'll be a couple dozen loaves of bread for sale in the front area, across from the hostess station. Grab a loaf, take it home and when you walk through the door, hold it up to your crotch and pretend its your junk.  A hybrid, somewhere between a baguette and a traditional french loaf, you'll look like Ron Jeremy with this thing.  Go ahead. Wave it around. Maybe even do 'the helicopter' with it, signaling your after-dinner intentions transcending any level of naughty she's even vaguely familiar with.   Then prepare to eat your soup by yourself after getting a lecture on holding up any and every phallic shaped object to your crotch, as if it was some gigantic dong.  Keep on dreaming, my friend.

My iron skillet pancake was fantastic as was the bowl of that magical pumpkin soup. Would recommend this place for brunch, lunch, happy hour or dinner.  Always a winner for us but be careful what you order as not all offerings on the menu are winners.   A little fine tuning is needed.",

Finally a place that doesn't overcook salmon. The flavors were unique and complimented each other well. I definitely recommend this place. They also have complimentary valet parking on site which I'm a huge fan of because I cringe at the idea of dealing with park garages in the city. Thanks St. Francis for a wonderful experience. It was a great time celebrating my best friend's birthday here.",

We were happy and could care less about waiting for food (over an hour and 1/2, we did not order appetizers). They all kept apologizing for food taking so long. The place was not full by any means. If this review was service based alone, would be 5 stars. But, oh geez - the food was downright awful. As a central Phoenix neighbor have been going to St. Francis since day one. After I made a reservation a friend warned me that things had changed, wish had I listened to her. Our food was barely edible, all meals to our table were either undercooked/overcooked and made with wrong ingredients. Kids grilled cheese is now pepperjack on a bun? This used to be a great place with quality ingredients made well. See no reason to ever go back, too many other great restaurants in the area. Unless they get a new chef, do not see this place lasting much longer.",

We both ordered salmon but we waited so long that we asked for the check and left. All the wait staff were new and the menu was changed a bit. Must be a new owner, new chef, and new staff.

We sat outside next to people with a sweet small dog, the day was sunny and company was great.   We ordered delicious red sangria (only $5 until 5pm!) and enjoyed catching up. So far I was a 5/5 experience. For lunch we split the burrata and fig salad and the pork verde (the waitress said this was a favorite dish).   When the salad came out, it was a very small salad with a good sized slice of baguette with a healthy portion of both burrata and fig spread and a tiny bit of frisee salad next to it. Being a huge veggie person, I was disappointed in the lack of the absolutely delicious salad and the huge portion of baguette with too much sauce and not enough fig flavor, for my preference.   After that they brought us the chili verde. The meat was very chewy and the sauce was okay. We both politely ate what was in our plate but neither of us finished it or took home the leftovers. To be honest, I went home and got something else to eat because I was starving. For a $60 lunch for 2 (with 2 sangrias each) I didn't expect to go home hungry. I would be willing to come back again for the sangria and try something else on the menu, but the food was disappointing to me. If I could JUST get a nice sized bowl of the salad, I'd order that again in a heartbeat.",

A friend and I came here hoping we could score some eggs Benedict, unfortunately I didn't do enough research and brunch is only served on Sunday's. We were so sad. However, our server was AMAZING! He offered to ask the chef to make us some breakfast and the chef agreed, after all that trouble we both settled for lunch lol. But I have to say CUSTOMER SERVICE was on point.   Next time I will come here to try their eggs Benedict. I ordered their bacon crispy onion burger with a side of fries. Everything was really good. The burger was a little dry for my preference but nothing a little ketchup cannot fix!   I love the space and atmosphere of this place i didn't realize they had an upstairs sitting area as well! Their menu is PERFECT pretty much to the point. And if you are familiar with my reviews short and sweet menus are like a BIG DEAL to me!   I am definitely planning to come back when my family from California is visiting for some Sunday brunch! To show them that yes I miss home but hey there's good food here too! :)",

But I couldn't believe my eyes when this dish hit my table and--instead of seeing a layer of hollandaise atop my eggs--the biscuits were swimming in a pool of what appeared to be pure melted butter. Taken aback, I believed this was simply the way St. Francis has decided to prepare its eggs benedict--otherwise, surely no reasonably aware server would serve an eggs benedict with bare eggs and soaking wet biscuits.   Unfortunately, I went home after my meal to look at photos of the eggs benedict on Yelp, and it appears that the restaurant does usually utilize hollandaise sauce. So now I'm forced to wonder how anyone could ever imagine serving to me the inexcusable mess I received today. Phoenix Public Market Cafe is one of my favorite restaurants, but its sister establishment simply does not hold its own, at least not based on my experience today.",

    "text": "New owners, not the same St. Francis! ...  Having been to St. Francis many times I took my wife yesterday because she had never been there. Sad to say, as we walked up I noticed the place was dimly lit on the exterior and it looked like they hadn't had their landscaping done in a long time... I said nothing to my wife at the time because I didn't want to ruin it. As we entered I noticed the windows were dirty and the place just seemed unkempt. To my surprise, the normally packed bustling restaurant was dead! I really began to worry at this point but we persevered. We ordered some bruschetta to start and it came out with goat cheese, which wasn't on the description and neither of us like, sent it back...whatever, not a big deal. We then ordered and received our meals, I got the Moroccan meatballs which have always been great.... meatballs were ice cold in the middle!!! Yuck!!! I just hope they were cooked and then frozen because other wise I just had a bite of some lovely cold, uncooked pork! Server was good and apologetic... we asked to pay for our drinks and leave, he said don't worry about it, that it all was taken care of... we pressed to be charged for something so we could at least tip him, poor guy! Long story short, place sucks now, don't go! To the new owners, get it together or close down and stop wasting everybody's time!",

    "text": "It was my daughter's birthday. Since we all live in all parts of the valley, we often meet up in the center of town. This often means that our get-togethers are in Central Phoenix.  We opted to give St. Francis a try together as a group. I've eaten here for lunch on several occasions and was never disappointed. I figured that this would be a good birthday hangout for all of us to enjoy each other's company, in this pleasant atmosphere. All the while, enjoying this establishment's delectable offerings.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Let me start with the baker's board. It was a selection of treats only Otis Spunkmeyer can make. We had mealy sweet muffins, chokingly disgusting coconut macaroon and some very much not homemade danishes. I think Otis should come and demand royalties.   Next for the Eggs Benedict. My daughter and wife had this dish. The eggs were cold and tasteless. The salmon tasted raw.  Neither could finish them as they were that disgusting. My market side frittata was okay, but not very special. It was rather bland, all things considered.   It's a good thing we came loaded with gifts for our girl because the eats were no bueno.  Not sure what happened, but none of this was what I was expecting from one of my favorite lunch spots.",

I recommend requesting a table further from the stage. I ordered the pig sandwich which was hands down one of the best dip sandwiches!! Their fries are also very flavorful and crispy. Kyle got a burger, which he said was slightly overdone but looked delicious.  The mimosas are in champagne flutes and $8 each, so I skipped alcohol. The Bloody Mary looked ok, but Kyle didn't rave about it which means it was likely average.  Wayne had the French toast, and it looked like a large portion but very yummy.  Happy hour is in our future here for sure",

Unfortunately, the good and values are no longer support this business establishment to the STANDARDS as it used to represent.  I will not going back here!  This place has recently changed owner - it's simply suck! I was quite embarrassed...I brought my friends visiting international to this place on a Saturday (23rd of March to be exact). First Issue was reservation. I made a reservation via Yelp and requested for patio (main reason with this weather). We showed up & this request was not able to accommodate. The outside patio is half-empty. I asked the (acting like) a manager again, and he finally decided to seat us outside (Hence the One Star ...At least he's trying to make it right!) Second Issue was the Orange Juice. We asked the waiter, Nick, if they were fresh squeezed. \"Yes\" was the answer.  Come' on !!! Don't claim this if it is just freshly squeezed out of the box! Nick confirmed that he was mis-informed. Third Issue was the Egg Benedict was served without the hollandaise sauce...? What was really sad (and ironically...funny) there were three orders of Egg Benedict, two of them didn't have the hollandaise sauce. One  did! We asked for the sauce, and Nick brought them out. Sadly, none of the managers ever came out to said a word...of acknowledgment (so, sorry was a far-fetch!)",

I tried the pork chili verde (pictured), which was very delicious and flavorful, but the side of cornbread was dry and such a small portion that it wasn't enough to eat with my pork. I tried some of my boyfriend's salmon, which was well-cooked but also a smaller portion than anticipated.  The real disappointment was the vegan chocolate cake. It was dry and flavorless.  We might be back to try other dishes, but will not be trying any other desserts.",

It was such a fresh ingredient unique menu type place, on today's visit I was so strongly disappointed I will never go again.   First,  I went at 1:50 was told couldn't sit outside ( which was empty) because they had a party coming in..oook no biggie.. Keep in mind they close at 3. By the time we left... no party showed up.  Inside the whole restuarant was a mess. Just food on the floors, dirty tables seats looks like they need to be replaced on the benches, dirty tables... just horrible! Went to the bathroom and so dirty! not just busy dirty, dirty like it hasn't been deep cleaned in some time. Dirty like the walls are dirty, dirty.  Food came and my beet entree was horrible. Not just palate horrible, but esthetically made horrible. The beets were not fresh, the bacon was dry, it was just bad.  My Eggs Benedict was even worst. Eggs were thrown and hardly correctly made, Salmon was missing, and the potatoes weren't fully plated.   I dlsent it back and to credit the restuarant they did take it off the bill.. but I didnt eat it. Like non of it, at this point I was over St. Francis.   To the waiter I did tip 10 because he was nice.   St. Francis What happened!",

We felt so bad for our valet because it was on a torrential monsoon evening.  In a beautifully designed dining room, hubby and I were seated at a table for two. It was still Happy Hour, so we ordered the Baked Goat Cheese. When it first came out, it looked good, but when we cut into it, it was cold and the tomato sauce was definitely under-developed. When they brought another serving back, it was perfectly done. All the flavors melded, and it was the star of the night.  The Caesar Salad was okay. The ingredients fresh, with shaved Parm. Yum!  I had to order a pizza after seeing the amazing pizza oven. The Margherita Pizza was fresh tasting with a crust that we used to sop up more of the Baked Goat Cheese.  We closed the evening with Crispy Fingerling Potatoes after we saw an order arrive at another table. The crispy rosemary was delicious. The portion was large.  Hubby and I also shared a delicious cocktail: Santa Rosa.   It was a delicious meal, but we agreed that the next time we came, we needed to reduce carbohydrate intake. We walked out high on carbs.",

    "text": "I ate here on 5/26/19. The food was amazing. I was so impressed.we arrived around 7 and sat on their patio. It was a very nice relaxing atmosphere. The tables not too close but still felt intimate. We had a few items, the Buratta appetizer( this is very sweet and creamy) only complaint with this was not enough bread to really finish it. It's a bit too sweet to just eat alone. Also I'd recommended eating this as a dessert. I had the pig dip. This was by far one of the most amazing dips I'd ever had. It's like a French dip but with all pork. The aju was to die for. The sandwich is pretty large so I felt they could have given a bit more. When I did ask I was told a small side was over 3.00. That was a bit crazy. Especially because of the size of the sandwich and the bread Initially. It got pretty dark outside while we were eating and you could see all the elderly people with their phone flash lights on, eating and completing their receipts. One lady asked about lights and it took 10 minutes for someone ( manager I assume) to get them turned on. It had appeared most people were outside eating so I'm unsure what the delay was. All in all it was a great meal. I recommend their food.",

The menu here changes seasonally, based on what ingredients are the most fresh.  They even have seasonal vodkas!  Our waitress said that something like 95% of all their ingredients are bought locally and everything on their menu is made from scratch.   They always have at least one vegetarian entree (lately it has been some kind of vegetable rice bowl) and their soups are usually vegetarian, as well.    Sometimes they show sports game on a projection screen on the patio, which can make for some classy Suns game nights!  The parking (at nighttime) is valet only.",

The cornbread was tasty, though I'm doing low carb so only had a small bite.  The wine...a Pinot from RRV was ok, def not a $13 wine at regular prices but decent for half price.  My li'l Caesar was good.  Husband had the meatballs with pearl pasta.  These were large, hearty red sauce and a big slice of crusty bread.  Moroccan spices threw him off a bit but not overpowering.  Probably would make different choices if we return.  Happy hour saved us $24 so that was good.   Was pretty loud even T 5 pm on a Saturday...lots of kids which surprised us.  If we go back it will be after the kids are in bed...",

    "text": "Just about everyone has wonderful things to say about St. Francis...and I'm no different. But I will make this review short and sweet.   The decor and overall feel of the place is uber cool and reminds me of Seattle in a way.   I've been twice now and both times service has been outstanding. Maybe just a touch slow, but everyone in CenPho is trying to get into this place. I get it...they're busy. And for good reason.   Which leads me to the food and drink section of my review. The green chili pork stew ($12) is amazing! Not too spicy, but bold flavors that go great with the cornbread. Also fantastic is the romaine salad with endive, bacon, apples, and a creamy cheddar dressing ($9). I have an allergy to apples and this was worth the slight break out in my throat. Too much info? Sorry folks...just telling the whole story. My two favorite items so far are the sweet corn polenta ($3 side dish) and the baked goat cheese with a tomato, walnut, hard pesto. They are both out of this world!! One one thing I would like to let Management know is that the little bread served with the goat cheese is so dang hard, they made my month hurt. Seriously, these puppies are CRISPY! So even with the apples and the bread that makes your mouth bleed St Francis still earns a 5 star in my book.  Try the St Francis Meyer Lemonade ($9) as well.  A little pricey, but VERY de-lish!   St Francis is fabulous both for a date night and dinner with the girls.  But what can I say, Dottsy and Nico are two of my favorite people. :) Can't wait to take my sister here next week when she visits!",

    "text": "The business man's lunch special at St. Francis is sooooo good!  I've had it several times, and it's a lovely 3 course meal.  The salad that comes out is small, but feels upscale.  One was asparagus based and another used haricot vert (small green beans) as the base.  Really great vinaigrettes!  The most memorable main course was the beef and mushroom ragout over the parmesan risotto.  It is really yummy!   The third course has been a great little to-go bag of cookies.  It's usually $18 (I think) for the 3 course business man's lunch special and it's worth every penny!  The service is also very good.  The last time I was there for lunch, the 3 of us had black pants on, so the waiter brings us black napkins to replace their standard white ones so that the napkins didn't get white fuzz all over our black pants -- that's thoughtful service!    As good as this place is, I can't quite give them 5 stars (but they are dang close!). I went for dinner one night and my side dish (can't remember the entree) was creamed spinach.  I was so looking forward to the classic creamy spinach dish, but the waiter delivered my food and I saw these unappetizing spinach balls.  I think when the chef wants to really mix up a classic, the waiter needs to let you know what to expect.  The spinach balls had a gummy, dry texture and were not by (any definition) creamed spinach.  But, the waiter and chef made it right and brought me a different veggie - which is why I continue to come back.  Going back next week for lunch, in fact.  Great food and GREAT service!",

    "text": "This restaurant exemplifies how to make a customer for life. I was working late on Valentine's Day and my girlfriend was at Montelucia babysitting for a tourist, so I figured I'd take the opportunity to saddle up at a bar somewhere and get a quick bite to eat.   Houston's had a set menu and was full, Oregano's was packed to the gills and offered a small menu as well, then on to SunUp, who had a limited menu as well. By this point, I was ready to pop... I just wanted a bite to eat, but I didn't want to settle for Subway again. From the moment I arrived at St. Francis, I felt 100% welcome. I asked the valet where I could self park, he said right up front I could take any place I wanted. The hostess, when asked if I could eat at the bar, said I could make myself right at home. They were all so nice.   I saddled up to the bar and was immediately given a \"couple's\" menu featuring a rather steeply priced dinner for two. I got out of my seat and before I left I asked the bartender if she happened to know of a place in the area which wouldn't be on a set menu (who knows, she might have a friend in the industry that told her where they work wasn't doing anything special.) She snarked back that they were offering the couple's menu and that was it. Perhaps she was upset she was working V-day, but she was the only unhappy person I encountered. Her bar-back was on the ball and went to get the manager, who immediately offered to get me a burger and fries! Awesome!  The French Onion Burger was fantastic. It was a very high quality and inventive way to serve a hamburger, and was sided by some great french fries and a spicy ketchup that I found to be delicious. $20 for a burger and a beer was a little more than I would expect to pay normally, but this is a VERY nice restaurant so I quickly got over it.  Overall, this is a neat spot anyway, but the overly accommodating attitude of the staff made it an easy five-star review in my book. I can only hope they are like this all the time, and if they are, they will succeed for a long time to come.",

Add a splash of lemonade and let the warm weather commence! Their 'house-infused' vodka just happened to be honey so as a seasonal occurrence I recommend trying this cocktail, pronto!  The bathrooms are cool. Simple, but the sink was a little visual trick that made me say \"Ahh! So you're the sink!!! Hello.\" I am always scouting out the design and feel of places and I If I were to die and come back a restaurateur I would definitely add this style to my top 10.  The cauliflower soup was amazing with just the perfect amount of curry, topped with capers and raisins. De-lish.    I ordered the salmon salad for dinner. Apparently, I have become quite the connoisseur of salmon (thanks farmers market fisherman for making my standards so high) because I wasn't entirely impressed by the salmon texture or flavor itself. However, the balsamic-glazed beets and presentation of the salad itself was gorgeous with thinly sliced cucumbers lining the plate topped with baby arugula.  We ordered the apple galette for dessert and I envisioned the french tart with the flaky crust and caramelized apples glistening atop. However, the apples were encased in the pastry and there were very few apples so my expectations were a little off. Of course the creme fraiche on top was fantastic. In all fairness I think some of the other dessert choices would have been more unique to St. Francis and likely better!  So many places to try, so little time. I must revisit during happy hour and to try some other dishes!",

Last night, I had the Green Chili Verde with a side of the smooth velvety Whipped Potatoes. Very good indeed. Although spicy, the flavor of the dishes were excellent. My taste of Andrea's Seafood Cioppino was also bomb.   As usual, X came along with us and was as calm as ever. We're teaching him the great gift of eating at restaurants ;). While there were no other babies (or kids) during our visit, St. Francis does offer two menu items just for the little tykes... Pot roast, or cheese pizza. As an added bonus, these two items come at no charge! That being said, and if you have some foody kids, St. Francis isn't that bad of a place!  Dessert wise, I wasn't too impressed with the chocolate cake, or the time it took to make a single cup of coffee, but all that seemed to melt away as the valet had our car right at the entrance ready to go before we even got there. A nice little end to a great meal.  P.S. The bartender didn't know how to make a Gin Fizz",

Parking is tight, forget the local street possibilities or the strip mall across the street and resign yourself to their valet.  Ms. D was late in arriving but we still got into their Happy Hour -(thank you Yelp'ers, this was a great tip).  I was early and at my asking The Hostess had saved us the one available outdoor seat which I knew she would want, so they accomodate special requests with ease.  We were cheerfully greeted by server Lonnie who was on top of it and got us exactly what we wanted in two flights of food and twin drink orders for a fantastic value in record time before the happy hour clock struck end.    I had been before and sought out their Grapefruit 'tinis but they weren't available, so Lonnie recommended the Ruby Reds which we selected and found to be quite good too.  The interior has a wonderful atmosphere, not too loud, pleasantly decorated and be sure to notice the architecture cable ceiled which add a modern tone to the place.  The goat cheese was wonderful, pork verde delicious and Ms. D said her onion burger was fantastic.  Total was just under $45, added 20% tip so it hit the value mark well in the bullseye.  We were never pushed, politely attended too and had the perfect scenario to focus on our conversation. Wonderful for a first date, casual business meeting or possibly even an anniversary.  I don't hand out Five Stars easily but when I want to impress picky foodie Ms. D and then it all goes well, I pull out the props.  Service, food quality, variety, selection, portions, drinks, and value were all spot on.  This is not the first time I've been to St. Francis and it has been consistent so I'm calling out the rare 5 star award based on dependability and repeated service.   Thank you",

We had the first table when you walk in the front door.  It was nicely designed restaurant and very homey and inviting.  This restaurant is very kid friendly, they have a box of toys, and Kids under 10 eat for free.    My two favorite dishes was the Roasted Salmon Superfood and the Pork Chile Verde.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection.  The veggies and the quinoa in the Superfoods were delicious and paired well with the Salmon. The Pork Chile Verde was so delicious.  My friend ordered this first and let me try a sample and then after my Salmon dish i ordered the Prok Chile Verde.  I don't normally like Chili but this dish flavors was so on point and it was delicious.  I ordered two dishes for lunch, both were amazing and made super happy!    I will definitely will come back if i ever visit Phoenix again.  I would definitely go if I had kids under age 10, they get to eat for free! That is amazing!  Thanks for the good food and awesome service.",

Last time I was here I had the French Onion Burger, it was one of the better gourmet burgers I've had in a long time. These guys do a great job with baking, so the burger bun (brioche) held up like a champ and did not fall apart, despite the burger being loaded.   Green Chile Pork is delicious, fried egg on top is (in my opinion) the only way to try it.   Baked goat cheese is a perfect appetizer.  Moroccan Meat Balls were great, the plate was much bigger than I thought it would be.   I look forward to the next time I'm here!",

Well, I'm glad we finally made it in!  Hubby ordered the Moroccan meatballs. Um, hello! I am not a 'ground meat' (which is what I consider ALL meatballs) kinda girl and I kept stealing bites from him. They were sooo dang delicious!! And the smell. Wow. Tarragon? Is that what I tasted and smelled?? My brain kept going to cinnamon but I know it's not that. I ordered the pork chili verde. Holy melt in your mouth pork! Such amazing flavors. And the corn bread?? So good. I'm a mid-west raised girl and this cornbread was mmm mmmm good.  Seriously, we'll be back. My only 'complaint' was that I felt closer to the man at the table next to me than my husband. The table was on the longer side so I felt far away from him. I have a hard time hearing in crowded places so carrying on a conversation was a little hard.  Oh, we went during happy hour and our meals were $3 off. So that was a bonus! :)  Did I mention that we'd be back??",

This place is a great antidote to frozen-microwaved-premixed-mass production -commercialized food that is used in so many restaurants today. But it has flavor! (True food restaurants sometimes are so busy steaming veggies that they forget to use True food seasonings) Great price point too.   The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because it was really hard to hear each other at our table because of the level of energy and noise in there. Next time we'll ask for patio seating.",

    "text": "It is a very happening place at the moment. They have Valet parking, at least on Sunday, which is nice since the place is packed. Their menu labeled vegan, vegetarian, gluten free and something else for each dish for those that care about that sort of thing.  I made reservations and came early to check in. Go in on the reservation time. They have a bar area that you can buy drinks from while you wait. Seating while you are waiting is may be an issue. The staff was extremely friendly. We got seated on the second floor. The floor plan in general is very open. The Jazz (i think) music was from a live band till about one thirty. Not bad at all.  I like sweet drinks. I did not find their spritzer or mimosa sweet. So I didn't like them. However the Johny apple seed drink was amazing. They were out of a lot of the bakery things so they were not able to give me the bakery platter or the biscuits and gravy I had ordered. But I did get the cranberry chocolate chunk scone and  the iron skillet pancake. I was a little sad that neither had hardly any chocolate. Otherwise they were tasty.  The reason for the low review is mainly because they were out of so mush. For it being a brunch place that was so popular on a Sunday, I expect their bakery to have baked goods. Especially when part of the waiters speak was the fact that they have a bakery down stairs that makes their own baked goods and have half the menu for said baked goods.  Service was fine, But when you want to eat something and already changed it once, it gets kind of annoying for all the hype this restaurant was getting. Swankiness only counts for so much when there is no food. The brunch menu is very limited so no backed goods means you are basically getting s sandwich or salad for lunch if you don't want the pancake. Since there were reservations I don't think I will be bake if the kitchen can't cook with the reservations along with walk-ins for the restaurant in mind.",

After 40 minutes our waiter informs us that the kitchen is backed up and we will have to wait longer. After a bit longer, we notice that a party of 9 people who were seating after us, and ordered after us, were served. Now we are really irritated. The waiter brings us a \"complimentary\" loaf of bread for our troubles (note- we've already told the waiter that one of our children is allergic to gluten), so we eat it while our daughter watches us. When our food finally arrives- it is good. But, we're pretty miserable. We understand that mistakes happen. But, this was handled so poorly. I'm shocked that a manager didn't even approach us and our waiter's apology bread wasn't enough or sincere. It was pretty obvious we were upset. I certainly hope that someone reads this and some training protocols are put in place so other families don't have such a miserable experience.",

Like I'm not exactly sure what flavor I was expecting but I was shooting for tasty. #fail. The kids pasta was more like a cous cous. My daughter was crying and pushing it away. I had to leave to feed her elsewhere. It was an epic fail. Meanwhile the waiter seen the untouched food. Usually they would ask \"was everything ok?\" Or \"how did you like it\"? He obviously knew the answer so he didn't even ask. I just paid the check and needed to go for a second lunch. #epicfail",

It was inedible. When the server came by, she was oblivious to the situation, never asked if we needed for drinks or how our food was. When the bus boy came by he grabbed the untouched plate and there was no mention of this foe frittata ever again.

I had their ceviche that had a sweet melon base.  I thought the ceviche was interesting, but frankly, prefer a less sweet ceviche version.  In cooler weather, they have a thriving outside bar area and a lot of folks enjoy their happy hour prices and drinks.  If you're interested in locally sourced foods with a dash of creativity in terms of preparation, St. Francis is a great selection.  It is also one of the many Phoenix area restaurants that use valet parking even though one can spy an open spot right in front of your eyes.  I don't really understand the insistence on having to valet one's car, especially in the summer months when most restaurants are not as filled (even though called \"complimentary,\" it still requires a tip).   The upside is that it employs a lot of young people--and I suppose that's a good thing.",

It was our first time enjoying this establishment and I  have to say that we were more than pleased with every aspect of our experience.  Our server, Barry, was knowledgeable and helpful regarding sharing with us about the food and making appropriate recommendations.  He was attentive without being overbearing.  Also, there were other employees that would be at our table when needed, Daniel, Shelby and Ian were all pleasant and made our experience even more satisfying.    We started our meal by ordering the fingerling potato appetizer that was unique and tasty.  Who would have thought that seasoned potatoes would qualify as an appetizer, but the St, Francis kitchen staff pulled it off with our kudos.  The potatoes come with a couple of dipping sauces, an aeoli sauce and a chili sauce variety...but added to the seasoned potatoes.  If you get there before 6 pm, this appetizer qualifies as a happy hour item that becomes a very reasonable item to order.  For our main course, I ordered the Pork Chili Verde and my wife had the Cheese Flatbread.  She said it was delicious, not overly seasoned, but subtle hints of garlic and basil tomato sauce enhance the variety of cheeses that are melted on the flat bread. The Pork Chili Verde had that appropriate kick that awakened your taste buds and warmed you on a cool December evening.  The chili warmed the palate without being overwhelming.    As with any review, it is one person's opinion and experience...but for my wife and I, we enjoyed our time at St. Francis...the people, the food and the atmosphere..a very positive and enjoyable experience.",

Try the pig-dip it's fantastic, made on their house-baked bread. They were able to organize a table for about 15 people on short-notice, they even delivered me a drink from the bar when a well-wisher who couldn't attend called the restaurant to send me a birthday beverage.

    "text": "This is one of my all time favorite restaurants in Phoenix. A little hard to find and if you blink, you will miss it. so slow down when your gps says you are getting near and don't blink. They have valet parking and trust me, you want to use it. The parking for patrons is nearly non-existent, but they take VERY good care of your car, so don't worry.   I love everything about this restaurant. the modern yet rustic feel, the staff is super friendly, the food is delicious... I love the forbidden rice, the sliders, the salads and even a few of their wood fired pizzas. I am not a big meat lover pizza kind of girl, but they have this really awesome pizza with all types of italian meats and it is so good. My husband always had their potato wedges app and says they were amazing.   They have this rum martini that is also very good and I apologize that the name is escaping me, but it is a RUM martini and I believe they only have one on their menu with Rum.   You don't feel rushed, the bathrooms are clean, the indoor outdoor seating is fun, the music is at a perfect level and I love the fun copper/metal/wood tables.   If you are in the area, check them out. Pricing is about med-high in range I suppose. Worth it.",

Wife had the baked tomatoes and I had the pancake. I recommend sharing whatever you get as the pancake is really RICH, you need to cut it with something savory. Also be sure to add a side of meat if you select these two options.   Sundays live Jazz brunc from 10:30am - 1:30pm, well worth it! I recommend the upstairs balcony seating overlooking the bar area (#greatpeoplewatching) For the guys going, there is a tv in the bar but most seats don't face it.   Overall I give them 4 stars for my Sunday Brunch experience. We will visit again for dinner to see the night time Swag!",

Definitely will be back on my bucket list the next time we visit Arizona.

The appetizer goat cheese & sauce tasted like Ragu & provolone with minimal amount of bread & when asked for more, brought 2 tiny extra pieces. The shrimp risotto had 4 tiny shrimps & kind of gruel that was just not good.  I'm sorry I cannot recommend anything about this place.",

My server was a sweet girl named Kyle. I remember this because 1) that's a unique name for a woman, and 2) the service was *that* good.  In my experience, interactions with servers can tend to feel pretty plastic. Not so with Kyle. Kyle was professional and personable - kind in a way that made you really believe that she cared about you. She was excited about the restaurant and its offerings and that excitement was contagious.  Turns out, her excitement was well founded, too. The food was as delicious as one might expect after a perusal of the menu. The coffee was great, too (I believe they serve Cartel, which I'm totally down with!).  I've been back several times since and the food/service combo has been on point each time. It is obvious that a lot of thought goes into the menu, so I'm always excited to try something new.  St. Francis is just a classy little place to visit. If you haven't been, GO! You'll be glad you did.  **But one thing to remember! (And I always forget this...) Parking is valet, so bring a couple extra dollars in cash to tip your valet with. He's super polite and always seems happy to serve. Definitely deserving of a tip, whether you like valet parking or not.",

They don't have all of the pieces of the menu in tact just yet, but there's enough there to get a great idea of what it's going to be like. The wood-fired oven gives everything a bit of rustic flair, and the cocktails that had debuted on the menu were poured with a heavy hand, so bravo. I tried the half-chicken, which was roasted to perfection: crispy, salted skin and plump, juicy insides.   The atmosphere is chic, beautiful and airy. The bar that opens into a small courtyard is one of Phoenix's most beautiful, and the patio space will soon have more beautiful people than the Vig. I'm curious to see what the upstairs portion will be used for --whether private events or additional seating, it looked like another fantastic use of space. For as long as they took to remodel this place, it looks perfect.   They do need to do something about the front door, though. It's a wide plank of glass so clean that someone planted his face right into it so hard he was stunned... I'm still not sure the poor guy knew what happened.",

    "text": "Wow! What a wonderful evening we had.   When I saw the great looking building that I had tried to buy with no success being ripped apart for a remodel, I was surprised. I began to drive by often to see what they were putting in the heart of my hood.  Finally two nights ago my dinner date and I went late to the new spot that I have been trying to get to for a month. The fall evening was the perfect back drop for this new Central Phoenix gem. My date and I are bar people. Upon approaching this new, swank joint, I could not keep my mind on the growing hunger that I was experiencing. I was too busy taking in the new design of the building and being so jealous that it was not mine. We immediately spied the bar and asked if we could eat our dinner there.   The bar tender was so welcoming and she helped us steer through the GREAT wine list.( Freshness finally) We odered a great bottle of tempranillo. Beautiful!  We decided to share plates in order to taste more offerings. We selected the flat bread of mission figs with arugula and goat cheese to start (wanted something from their wood fired oven) and the salmon salad. I will say that in the obvious attempt to keep things simple, the menu is very difficult to read. (grey on grey in a very small font) Hello?! Cenfo people with money to spend on great food need reading glasses! Also the food descriptions are a little too brief to truly know what is going to be on your plate. This spot uses tons of great ingredients to create the final taste and the patron should know what they are getting.  The flat bread wad more like True, great, Napoleon pizza. The crust was beyond perfect. Some pizza joints need to take a lesson here. Wilted leeks, goat cheese, fresh arugula, and the most amazing roasted mission figs topped with shaved pecorino. I needed nothing else.  Then came the salmon dish. Honestly, I can cook salmon...PERFECTLY. Mine was beautiful in this entree. Three large cuts of fish that were well seared and not over cooked. It was very fresh to the taste. It was served in a great big bowl lined in mixed  farm, fresh  greens with chopped celery, halved cherry tomatoes, Italian parsley, blanched yellow and green baby string beans, and blanched soy beans. Along the out side was a delightful grilled, fingerling cold potato. I could have done with out the poached farm fresh egg on top, but my truly Italian date gobbled it up and raved about the flavor.  We were ready to explode but the guy next to us was raving about thier desserts. I don't have much of a sweet tooth but my date... well that is a whole other story.   He ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding. This is sin, cellulite, belly flab, dunlap all of the above on a plate. OMG! Rich and decodent, perfectly steamed like a Boxing day in the UK. The wonderful treat was topped with locally made sweet cream gelato.  I can see myself sitting there often and viewing out on my beloved neighborhood eating good quality great tasting food for a fare price with stellar service. They are new, and have a few bugs to work out but this is going to be a very popular spot for the Central Phoenix foodies who have grown weary of bruschetta.",

The menu is limited, but more than sufficient.    I had the chicken salad, at the recommendation of the bar tender.  It was quite good.  While it comes with either fries or salad, upgrade to the fingerling potatoes ($2) which were perfect in every way.   The drinks were poured with a liberal hand and the wine selection was very good.  There are many beautiful people there.  It is a bit off-putting, but the food is worth the trade-off.",

Will likely dine here again in the future   The only thing that was a little off-putting was that the live music they had playing was so darn loud, that we were literally shouting across the table at each other just to be heard, making it impossible to have a nice Sunday Brunch conversation. After one particularly loud song, we finally asked the waiter if there was anyway they could take the volume down a notch or too so we didn't have to shout at each other.  That seem to do the trick.   otherwise, the place was delightful!",

I like that.  The margaritas are really excellent.  The food was delicious and satisfying.  If you order the potatoes, make sure you eat some of the fried sage with it, otherwise you'll wonder why people like them as much as they do -- The sage makes all the difference.  Our waitress, if I could only remember her name, might be the best waitress in the world.  My one complaint: it is very loud.  I'm looking forward to going back on my next trip!",

    "text": "So my valentine took me to St. Francis for our V-day dinner. I don't know if they are as awesom on non-holidays, but they really aced Valentines!  Our waitress was well informed and seemed genuinely stoked at our choices. She was attentive without being all up in our business, and each course lingered just long enough for us to get to chat conspiratorily throughout the meal.   I had the celery root soup (delicate, yet rich and not at all chalky), the seared scallops (large, but not quite as sweet as they could have been. the garnish made for a beautiful as well as tasty plating), and the chocolate-grand marnier fondue (the best part was when the waitress came by and said that fingers were TOTALLY allowed in the fondue pot... and oh yes I did). We had a couple of cocktails which were a perfect balance between fruity and liquory.   The space is a nice blend of industrial and intimate. The rust and steel exposed beams and cement fixtures give the small space a cool, modern feel, while the solid wood tables and delicate place settings make it feel romantic. I loved eating inside with the large doors open to the patio.  The only reason I am giving 4 out of 5 is that, while I love restaurants with patios, the location of St Francis--on busy Camelback--makes me want a bit more of a privacy fence around the tables. Maybe live bamboo or something? I can't imagine that it's too lovely seeing fights in front of the Walgreens or hearing the traffic right next to your table. But avoid all that and get an inside table!   Be sure to check out the cool chalk board on the wall opposite the restrooms--it has seasonal recommendations for fruit, veggies, herbs, meat, and seafood. I wish I had a poster of it!",

They had some movie projected on to the wall next to us which was pretty cool.  Ambience was fantastic.  Lots of nice folks sitting around and striking up convos.  However, the highlight of my night was the dessert.  We shared this little piece of heaven...a toffee pudding thing with gelato.  I was pretty much the girl licking the bowl in the corner!  Ok...maybe not that extreme but I wanted to.  It was one of the best desserts I've had.  Can't wait to go back and try their other course offerings.",

Chic and contemporary without being oppressive, the restaurant has a nice low-key home feel to it.    I was hoping to get a chimay for a drink priced at $6...the same as a miller high life.  Even though it was the second day they didn't have any and instead settled for a rogue porter.    So I'll probably be one of the few people not satisfied with the peppered steak.  To me, a good steak should be able to stand on its own, flavorful in its own right.  For $20 and a medium rare cook I expect it to melt and be juicy and have a presence in the meal.  Maybe it was the beer, light reflecting off the gases of Jupiter, but this was not a tasty cut of meat.  The peppered crust was there to overpower and make up for the lack of tasty beef.  The meal was accompanied with pureed spinach and some sort of potatoes (both were good!).  St. Francis gets 3 stars for now:    - a cool venue    - wasn't that impressed with the meal    - will go again when there's a full menu and try the hobo      combos/meals",

Once in the parking lot the complimentary valet parking took over and did a good job welcoming us. It happened to be restaurant week and we chose the three course menu. My wife had to have the pumpkin soup and loved it. I started with Brussels sprouts and chorizo risotto and it was good. The pork my wife had was good and the scallops I had were great. The panacotta was good and the sticky pudding was good too. The albarino wine went well with my dinner. Service was excellent. Somehow it still took 1.75 hours for dinner. Price for dinner for two on the three course restaurant week dinner with wine for one including tax and tip was $115 which is reasonable, I suppose but not \"bargain city\".",

Not sure there's anything the place can do about it, but it sure made to an uncomfortable start--the 30 minute wait to get a table, even though I could see two tables big enough for us unused.  Our waitress was quiet in a loud joint. She got my order wrong.  I asked for the pork chile verde, she brought me the pork chop. The pork chop was very good, but the accompanying beans were way undercooked.  Oh, an the pork chop was $22, versus the pork chile verde I was planning on getting being $13.  The food was definitely tasty (for the most part) and fresh.  I'd rate the food a 7/10, but the waiting discomfort, the quiet and non-eye-contact waitress I'd rate a 4/10.   Overall, there are a lot of better places nearby.  I recommend Postino or Hulu's.",

The crust has just the right crunch to chewy ratio and slight buttery taste. Delicious! The Romain Hearts salad was very good too...didn't even need dressing.   For the main course, I was waffling between the monk fish and the Forbidden Rice dish. I decided on the fish, but wish I would've went with the rice. This is more based on preference than execution of the dish. I did have a great flavor.  All in all, St. Francis delivered again. Service in the restaurant could've been a little better, but the valet was extremely nice and helpful.",

Whenever I see Hitichino Nest on the menu I know I'm in the right place... Risotto was cooked perfect, slightly al-dente with nice earthy tones from the mushrooms and a light zing from the parmesan.  I sat at the chefs table so as I waited for the entree Chef Cole threw together a flat bread with caramelized onions and olives with a bit of roasted peppers that had a nice heat to every bite.  I ordered a Chimay to go with my open-faced pot roast sandwich with broccolini and caramelized carrots. Pot roast was nice and savory served over a thick slab of texas toast.  Taste was predictable until the caramelized carrots took over and pulled the flavors into another direction.  Forbidden rice became my dessert for the night. Simple light dish of rice and vegetables.  A must when you visit...",

They looked us but didn't say a word so we finally asked them what's happening and a waiter said that we had to either move inside or the bar.  We said No to that and my friend mentioned if we could see the Mgr.  The waiter came back and said that it was OK to stay and put another table as a couple of our friends arrived.  Weird.

It could have been spicier, though, and maybe served without the sauce altogether (preferable), or just not as much. My friend ordered the pork chop, which was perfect--juicy, great size--and definitely what I will order next visit. I heard brunch there is fantastic and based on this meal/experience, cannot wait to visit again.

    "text": "So I had the grandparents (From England) and my mom in Town for the weekend. It was the last night before they left so I was looking for a good go to spot with moderate prices. When in doubt, I Yelped it out!   I came across St. Francis on Top 50 hottest restaurants in Phoenix. I looked over the reviews and was won over. The menu looked great, it was different from the standard OId Town Scottsdale scene we had done for the past three nights so I was sold.   As we arrived I was impressed right off the bat by the building. It has a unique modern look with a very open feel.  It is a two storied restaurant that probably fits around 75 people on each floor.   When we arrived I went with a fellow Yelper recommendation with the Meyers Lemonade. It was somewhat refreshing but the Honey was a little over powering for my taste.   For apps we order the Corn Chowder and the Goat Cheese to share. I always back and forth on Goat Cheese it's kind of like when you go on a date and it only goes ok you could live without seeing them again or you could see them again (kind of a stretch analogy I apologize) Regardless this Goat Cheese was out of this world. It was perfect melted temperature accented with basil and various with ingredients. The Corn Chowder was also very good. It was very light and not very filling which made it great as an app.   The table pretty much covered all the entrees ordering the Pot Roast, Cioppino, Roasted Chicken, Salmon Salad and finally I ordered the Hangar Steak. Everyone was very pleased with their meal. The Cioppino had a little Bobby Flay type spice to it so just a heads up. My Hangar Steak was awesome cooked perfectly and a good size.   Finally to top off the fat kid meal dessert. Now I am like many fellow yelpers and never order dessert....that's a lie I look at the dessert menu more than the entree menu. Now with my Grandparents are from England so they thought they would give their expert opinion on the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Much to my surprise they have it the thumbs up. It we a perfect temp, size, taste and the accent of the vanilla ice cream was perfect.   Now after writing a novel why did this only get four stars from me? Unfortunately the service wasn't the best. Our server acted like this was his first serving job. He just forgot a number of the basics we constantly needed to ask for i.e. spoons for soup, water and steak knives with dinner.   In the end I will come back to St. Francis without question!",

I really wanted to like this place since I had heard good things about it, but the food was just blah. Nothing we ordered had any enjoyable flavor. I got the scallop entree, which I think is no longer on the menu in the version I had, but I'll never forget it because it came with a side of green beans that literally looked like they were smothered in thick body lotion (you're welcome for the visual, by the way!), there was a small puddle of what was supposed to be smoky tomato gloop next to it and the scallops were not even properly seared. The dish was downright unpleasant. The fingerling appetizer was also neither properly crisped-up nor very flavorful. Just a fail all around.",

(We got that comped for mentioning Twitter there), very nice!!            We all ended up choosing the pancakes infused with dark chocolate, drizzled in olive oil and topped with rasperries and creme on the side. Heavenly, is all I can say!! I`m rather embarrased to admit that when I was asked what my dinner meal was a month ago, I couldn`t remember! (Being in the middle of nursing school does that! I can`t even remember the awesome meal I had at FnB!) So forgiveme St. Francis, for I truly will be back for more! And they lave live jazz on the patio Sundays from 10-3.",

It's served on a soft brioche and the tangy chipotle mayo gives it an awesome flavor. I also stole a bite of biscuits and gravy with fried egg and that was just as amazing! I'm looking forward to going back again to try more of the menu out. The atmosphere is modern and chic and the live music was a nice touch! My only negative is I thought the drinks were a bit pricey for what they were. Oh, and they don't serve espresso drinks which I think Is a must these days for brunch. Other than that,an overall great brunch! One more tip I would get there right when they open as the wait when we were leaving was up to 45 min.",

Tonight I went with 2 fellow female foodies and we were very impressed.  The menu is a bit limited, but we were told that would change as they get settled.  We shared the goat cheese app, the salmon salad and the steak entree.  All of the items were creative and the ingredients were top notch.  The wine listed is about as limited as the menu, but there was certainly something on there for each one of us.  Overall, great atmosphere, yummy food and friendly, attentive service.

    "text": "I met friends here on the suggestion of Happy Hour eats n drinks. Arriving to the restaurant there were only 2 parking spots open and they were behind the beer truck that was blocking them, next to a foul smelling dumpster and gas tanks sitting out in the open.  It was about 4:15pm on a Tuesday.  I parked and entered and found the ambiance pleasant. I would recommend some blinds for the atrium seating so that during sunset your customers arent in a greenhouse.  The server was exceptionally polite and helpful and attentive. He even escorted me to the ladies room and advised me they were unisex. He was just a peach!  The unisex bathroom however, reeked of urine. There's a reason ladies prefer their own lavatory!  Structurally speaking, and this is being really picky, when you wash your hands in their unique sink, the faucet sits so low to the basin that your hands come close to dragging in the dirty basin that others have used. Icky.  Once the last minutes of happy hour grew near though, our server's attention, understandably, waned. They got slammed. Perhaps a drink runner for that last hour of happy hour would have aided us in getting our drinks BEFORE closing out AND paying our tabs.  The food choices for happy hour noshing were odd to say the least; a warm puddle of goat cheese with crunchy crostini; a cheese foccacia which was too similar to that served up at Sweet Tomatoes; cauliflower soup; grilled vegetables which was a pile of Lima beans with a few pieces of grilled cauliflower and carrots on top with some orange sauce drizzled over it all; Odd choices- and for being odd, they should have at least been delicious to counter the strangeness of the selections. They fell flat.  I then ordered the olive medley and a bread loaf which they purportedly bake on site. The olives were plentiful and tasty. The bread however was burnt. It had big empty holes in the middle so the amount of bread was slight.  Our cocktails were also unique, however some of them fell flat while others were so immensely strong we had to send 1 or 2 back.  The reason i will never return to St. Francis isnt even any of the above although it contributes. But the icing, the cherry on top was departing the joint.  Now I get why these hipster trendspots hire valet companies. The need to \"accommodate\" the customer who drives, is hopefully met by an attendant who crams your car into a packed lot meant for only about 16 cars.  When I arrived there was no valet to squeeze me into my spot behind the beer truck, next to the dumpster, near the gas tanks. But when I left my car was again blocked in, this time by other cars which had been sandwiched between my rear and the cars in the lanes behind mine.  it took quite the effort and my passenger getting out to guide me, to get out of my spot safely. On my exit, backwards, through the lot and around a corner, only then did I notice the valets. One was running about, the other seemed  a bit oblivious, flustered. I rolled down my window, and said \"You guys have to be kidding the way you block people in, \" I said smiling, trying to make light of the situation.  \"Most people know.\" he replied. \"Know what?\" I asked. \"To let us know.\" Confused, I wasnt sure what he meant.  My passenger said \"You guys blocked her in and she could barely get out.\" The attendant responded, \"Look lady, that's the name of the game.\" My passenger said \"What game is that?\" He replied sarcastically, \"Well if you've ever been to St. Francis...\" \"I have not\" I cut him off as he continued to try to explain that we should have known to come let them know so they could move cars to let us out.  1st of all, from my spot I couldnt see that there was even a valet set up. 2nd of all- to get your attention then to wait for you to rubix cube cars around would have inconvenienced me, YOUR CUSTOMER AND THE PATRON OF THE RESTAURANT THAT HIRES YOUR DUMB ASS TO CAR JOCKEY!  To which i replied \"I have not been here before and I wont be back now\" to which he replied \"Well good \" and rolled his eyes. St Francis- the valet is the first and last impression of your restaurant. And that is why, more than anything else, I wont be back and I try to avoid places that use valets b/c they are too cheap to buy extra land to accommodate the numbers their trendy new spot might bring in. Additionally 9and not in your case since our drinks were priced for happy hour) my money that pays for inflated bar and food prices should cover me for FREE PARKING and not to have to pay or even tip some juvenile dipshit whom I wouldnt let drive my car if he was my own relative!",

    "text": "\" I just don't get it?\" Everyone always talks this place up like it's God's gift to the planet. So I decided to give it a try. Now grant it I have been there three times now because I thought I was missing the magic show the en point d'orgue. I have had several dishes there, Roasted Salmon, Mama's Meatzza flatbread, Pork Chop, Romaine Heart salad. The dishes were all edible, I didn't have to \"seagull choke\" them down my gullet but every entree or salad I tried was very middle of the road. The ride was definitely not worth the price of admission. The service was mediocre, the beer and wine selection was limited. \" I just don't get it?\" maybe they were severing Kool-Aid at the exclusive entrance of the St Francis Skull and Bone secret society club? Good things to remark on; Auto Zone is a next door neighbor for your automotive needs and See's Candies is across the street for your sweet tooth?",

That is my absolute favorite part of the whole place, atmosphere is great and it can easily transport you and you don't feel like you're in the box in the middle of the parking lot. While all the food I've tried has been tasty, I always have hard time deciding on the menu. My only wish is that they expand a menu a little bit and include just a little more variety. But to summarize, I will be back, many times.",

It was really 95% diced cucumber with only a few small pieces of shrimp and the heat level was pretty high.  It tells you there are chilis in it but it was much spicier than I expected.  Still - the flavor was good.  I just wouldn't call it ceviche personally.  And we had a burger - which also was very good with lots of fries.  They split the order for us so that was really nice as well.  Clean, bright, friendly staff.  Lots to choose from.",

I took my colleagues recommendation and ordered the Moroccan Meatballs. The sauce was unbelievable. The depth of flavors between the fresh tomatoes and the Moroccan spices was amazing. I was very impressed. I liked that the dish was served in a hot, cast iron skillet. The meatballs themselves had a great crust for added texture, though the inside was a bit on the dry side.   Dish was served with a slice of crostini that was perfect for dipping up the rest of that delicious tomato sauce.   Look forward to coming back and sampling more of the very diverse menu.

We arrived with two guests who hadn't been there before and really wanted to impress them with one of our favorite joints in central Phoenix. We sat down at about 7:51pm and not one person had come to our table, not one, by 8:05. We asked someone walking by if we even had a server. A man came and promised the world. We decided to order a bottle of wine and by 8:40 we hadn't gotten it. We ordered an appetizer from another girl we made eye contact with and then our wine came and two seconds later came out app. I was embarrassed and my boyfriend asked for the manager. She offered to take our dinner order and or dessert then when she came over. We didn't want desert bc we hadn't even eaten dinner! I was really pissed but the manager comped our bottle of wine and fingerling potatoes. We went to another place close by and really enjoyed speedy service and attention from the wait staff. We will be back eventually but this was the worst service. P.s. this is a short summary of the way we were treated.... this is a long review but I don't want to barf it all out.",

    "text": "St Francis was the location of special date a few weekends back. We booked a table using OpenTable (on Yelp) for a Saturday and were promptly seated. I was stoked given the rave reviews and looked forward to a romantic dinner.  Until we were seated three feet away from a table of shrieking teens. Six of them.   (Eventually they left, and our dining experience remarkably improved. The volume returned to normal dining levels and it was possible to converse.)  Big shout out to Barry, our server, for doing everything possible to smooth things over. Even tho I had asked a manager (she was walking by) for an emergency Diet Coke (I forgot to eat all day) it was Barry who whisked it nano-seconds to our table. Barry also had a fresh Diet Coke at our table before a butterfly could possibly breathe. Our water glasses were never empty and our subsequent drinks were refreshed promptly.  Glass service is, in my opinion, a great indicator if a server is paying attention to your table. Barry was like frost on a window in winter. (A reference lost on Phoenix folks.) Except we never saw him unless it was necessary. He's that awesome.  St. Francis is a restaurant that will feed you and feed you well. (Big portions! Yummy stuff!)   I'm not kidding when I say \"big portions\". We shared the fingerling potatoes after scarfing a baguette down. There are enough potatoes on that plate to easily feed a family of four. (Seriously!)  We taste tested the Pork Chile Verde & the Pig Dip sandwich. I think if I had eaten the sandwich first I might have liked it more (as the cheese would have been warmer). I was wowed by the chile. I had to stop myself and remember to share. (It's not nice to eat all of the food when you're sharing :)   We sat on the main ground floor. I'd like to check out the outside bar / patio area next time. (Very cute!) I'd recommend booking a table alongside the walls if you're booking online. We were seated in the middle section. (We had traffic going both ways.)  The drink menu surprised me. St. Francis mixes a fabulous \"Dark & Stormy\"! We used to hunt around Manhattan trying to find the right ginger beer to make these. The Mixologist here has it down perfectly!",

We had the wild caught salmon with quinoa and it was cooked perfectly with a delicately browned crust and moist on the inside and truly the best tasting salmon and accompanying flavors that I've had in a very long time! \"Cheers\"",

We had the eggs benedict with pork loin,my husband had the french onion burger and my son had the kid's cheese pizza. Everything was very tasty,made with love, and quality ingredients. We love it when restaurants bring the kid's food first, which they did for us! The vibe was awesome, the decor was laid back and comfortable. We really enjoyed brunch, so much that we will come back for dinner ASAP!",

My favorites include the baguette and baked goat cheese to start, the french onion burger, and pork chile verde.    The ambiance is second to none.  Modern landscaping invites you in.  There's an inside/outside bar with seats on the inside on one side and on the other side on the outside patio.  The patio wraps around and provides an intimate, relaxed dining experience.  The inside is more vibrant, with loud music playing (but not so loud that you can't have a conversation).  I also hear they have a great Sunday brunch with a jazz trio for entertainment.  It's a great spot if you're in Central Phoenix.",

If you want to avoid the crowds come on a Sunday night, but be careful, as the kitchen closes between 9 and 9:30PM.  No reservations needed on Sunday because the crowd doesn't show up on Sundays, but be sure to have a reservation on Friday or Saturday, because the place packs up pretty quickly.",

Good brew selection, and mimosas and bloody Marys with brunch. Plus kids under 10 eat free.   The staff has always been friendly. I haven't had the slow service others have complained about. The food takes a while to come out but that is no fault of the server. The servers have always asked about my drink when they noticed it low.   My favourite menu item has been the eggs benedict with salmon, the hollandaise sauce is perfectly tangy and buttery! They used to be served with a side of fingerling potatoes, now they only throw a few on the plate. The pork chile verde is spicy and wonderfully seasoned. Its served with a large spoon and two slices of corn bread for the stew. I also love the cioppino; it's a spicy, red seafood stew. Definitely large enough to share IMO, and served with bread.   I've also come with friends for happy hour and just ordered appetizers and drinks. The feel was great and we all left happy and warmed by the fire on the patio.",

Service gets an A+ as well..  BUT, it was also extremely loud and dark.  I could barely hear the person sitting across from me at our tiny table, and it was too dark to read the menu.  This was on a Tuesday. Very crowded, and I\"m not sure what all the fuss is about.  If there's a wait, go somewhere else, it's not worth your trouble.  3 stars. Nothing great, but not really bad.  UPDATE: They also really chinced at Devoured. Only served a salad and a drink. Really did not showcase anything worth going there for.",

My boyfriend and I have conflicting schedules a lot of the time so I tend to dine alone (and am not upset about the solo time). On a Saturday night I assumed there would be a wait for an actual table so I opted to take a seat in the outdoor bar/lounge area. I faced the street, which might not be ideal for some people but was rather calming for myself.   My initial server was attentive and friendly, but the experience was later in the night when not only one, but three other servers stopped to see how I was doing.  I couldn't tell if this was a system set in place by the establishment or just the super genuine staff, but it didn't matter. Everyone who stopped seemed to care about my experience.

It was like a welcomed twist to the my go to whiskey ginger beer cocktail.   As for the food...We ordered the French Onion Burger (the best option in my opinion) and replaced the fries with fingerling potatoes ($2 extra). The fingerling potatoes were okay, should've just stuck with the fries. The burger, of course, did not disappoint. Also ordered the Meatballs, Pork Chili Verde and a cheese flatbread. Everything came straight out of the oven that so amazed us while waiting for our seats (we sat upstairs and it had a much quieter, less crowded feel with great views of the heads of palm tress haha). The Chili Verde was a favorite around the table but all four dishes were delicious and off the happy hour menu! Great finding random delights in the Arizona desert.",

But now that I think about it, these were all things I heard circa 2011-ish, so maybe St. Francis just isn't what it used to be?  That being said, I'll just jump right into what I didn't like.  We ordered the lunch special of the day, which was explained as a shrimp salad with mango salsa.  Sounds great, but what came to our table was 4 grilled jumbo shrimp on top of a couscous.  Now this was delicious, we scarfed it up, but if I was on some sort of gluten free or no carb diet, I would have been disappointed when the dish came out sans greens.  We also ordered the Morrocan meatballs, which were seasoned with WAY too much cumin.  It was overpowering.  I like the occasional cumin in Mexican and Moroccan fare, I even use it in my cooking quite often(even on steak and rib rubs) but this was way too much.  My mom and I each had a couple small bites and couldn't stomach it any longer.  I was SO sad, because the dish is on top of large balls of Israeli couscous and covered in melted mozzarella, and the cumin in the tomato sauce just overpowered it all.  Me reject melt-y, bubbling cheese?  Doesn't happen too often.  It is a cute little restaurant, and we may go back, I just wanted to share what I would have liked to know before going here(because I LOVE meatballs, and for my fellow meatball lover...heads up).",

The forbidden rice bowl uses a mystery black rice with vegetable and a special dressing.  The dressing is the magic.  You could put it on cardboard... Good service, atmosphere and food.  I will definitely return whenever I am in Phoenix.",

While waiting for my friends my server ( very nice guy from the Acoma reservation) brought me a complimentary tasting of the heirloom tomato salad, which was delish! The service, ambiance, and cuisine were great but unfortunately the entree was average at best (Fish). I will go again and try something else on the menu and definately will have the heirloom tomato salad again !!",

    "text": "I've had the pleasure of  trying St. Francis twice now... the latest  time, just last night, when I went with Yelp's one and only - the lovely Gabi - and her brand new hubby - Jared... plus my husband. It was a lovely double date, an occasion befitting the fun and hip vibe of this great little place.  They don't take reservations for parties under 6 people... so as a result we had to wait for a table especially having arrived on Friday night at 8:00pm. They told us 45 minute to 1 hour but the table was ready within about 1/2 and hour so that was a great way to start the evening.  The ambiance was great and our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu (he did screw up Gabi's order a bit which she wrote more about in her review...)   I started with an apple and hearts of palm salad which was the only salad option in the starters section - it was fresh and tasty... I had it without the creamy chowder dressing it comes with. For my entree, I had the flank steak that comes with a red wine reduction, fingerling potatoes and I substituted the creamed spinach it comes with, for the roasted vegetables (which are offered as a side on the menu.) It was a delicious dish! the meat was flavorful and the veggies light and fresh. We were too full for dessert but the options looked amazing!!!  The first time I dined there, I tried the veggie flat bread which was to  die for!!!  and I did try a couple of desserts that were ordered for the table... a chocolate mousse cake and the toffee pudding. They were, as they sound, delectable!!!  I could have done without the wait each time,  but overall I've had two great experiences at St. Francis!!!",

The service initially was decent, but at some point our server passed our table off to another server. We totally slipped through the cracks. No one came to ask us how everything was, if we needed anything, (we did), or even acknowledged us.  The food was decent but nothing to get excited about. Not a fan here.",

    "text": "Heard about St. Francis from a friend and have been meaning to try it for a while now. We finally made it out and weren't disappointed. It's one of our new favorites. (Honestly every restaurant that has any sort of association to the LGO group turns out to be great in our experience, so we weren't surprised)  Decor is modern, atmosphere is great. We were there on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. They only take reservations for large parties so we had about a 30 min wait which we spent drinking on the outside patio. They have a bar along the front of the restaurant that opens up to both the restaurant inside and the patio outside, which is a really nice touch and adds to the atmosphere.  The food is upscale comfort food I guess? We started with the baked goat cheese app. It was flavorful and the pesto was such a good touch. The toasted bread was a little hard imo.  For dinner we had a bottle of the malbec which was outstanding. Both my wife and I thought it was one of the best $35 bottles (restaurant price obv) that we've ever had. We shared the burger and the pork chop. The burger was a perfect medium rare which made me happy. The pork chop was great and the polenta had a hint of horseradish. I couldn't have been happier. There wasn't any part of the meal we didn't think was perfect.  Oh, and for dessert have the sticky pudding. It's out of this world.  Overall it was a perfect night. Plus we felt like the prices were really reasonable. One caveat, as some others have said, it's a hopping place and is pretty loud inside. We love that, but we were commenting while there how our parents probably wouldn't like dining there because it's not a quiet relaxing place..We'll definitely be back though :)",

You have to figure out what you're going to be during the weekends and I don't think Jazz Club is going to do you any favors.

The veg entree was a rice bowl. Rice is cheap. A rice bowl is big bowl of cheap simple carbs. Nothing special. I believe St. Francis would feel dishonored by this restaurant. Some of the fries I nibbled off my friend's plate were good but you can get good fries at nearly any place. Ketchup tasted store bought rather than made by the restaurant. Atmosphere was nice.",

While everything looked fabulous, we couldn't really pull the trigger on what we wanted.  Took our time ordering and just settled in and  enjoyed some drinks.  Jeannie really liked her peartini...liked it so much she is on a peartini kick right now!    Feeling like big unadventurous lame-os, we ordered a mixed green salad and  a couple of French Onion Burgers.  Even a lame-o can score here!  The salad was very good, but the burgers were awesome.  I guess if you are paying $13 for a burger you are hoping for awesome.  Maybe everyone is just doing a better job at burgers these day.  The good news is that you can bring a burger person here and feel confident that they will walk away truly satisfied.  Still feel weird about ordering a burger here though....making a pledge to order a real St Francis entree next time.  Service was solid. Even though the place was packed and the waitress was very busy, she managed to take good care of us.   The architecture and the decor inside alone ( and the peartini!) was worth the trip.  Stopping in and hanging out the bar might be our next \"no hamburgers allowed\" visit.  Sitting on the street side of the bar might offer the best vantage point for soaking up the St. Francis ambiance..",

Their happy hour drink specials are great -$5 for specialty cocktails AND they have happy hour on Saturdays! The happy hour food is basically a few bucks knocked off of some normal menu items. The only time we come here is for happy hour as they are a bit pricey. They have menu items that change with the season so you get the freshest food. Last time I was here I ordered roasted cauliflower from the vegetable section of the menu, this time I got the zucchini chips. Both so so good, how are vegetables this tasty?? The squash and zucchini chips came with 3 different dipping sauces that were all 3 amazing. It made us regret ordering the flatbread (basically exactly like a skinny pizza) because we just wanted more squash. My husband got the mushroom burger and he said it was great. I also got corn bisque which was good, it was soup, nothing to impress. The two cocktails I got were high quality and refreshing, the cucumber cooler and Santa Rosa. Great service, great high quality food, and beautiful ambiance - shouldn't that get 5 stars?",

My wife, I and our 8 year old son decided we wanted to go to Sunday Jazz brunch. We have eaten here a bunch of times when our son was younger and always had a wonderful experience. This time however we were barely acknowledged when we walked in the door. The two young hostesses finally, in a discouraging tone, told us that there would be a 30 min wait. Before we could have a chance to respond they already started talking with each other again. We stood for minutes until she finally replied \"Oh, did you want to put your name in?\" again in a discouraging tone. We were already sitting in the small waiting area... obviously the answer was yes. We were waiting about 15 min when a woman with 3 boys came in. She was told they would seat her at a bigger table than she required and did so. We shrugged it off because they had 1 more person than us. The next party to enter was an obvious friend of the hostess. They also had a party of 3 and asked \"Can you get us in?\" They were greeted with \" Got a table finishing up right now we'll seat you right away. My wife then asked if they had forgotten about us. They then stated \"Oh no... they have a reservation.\" We were in earshot and heard the entire conversation.   The attitude and demeanor of these hostesses as if we were undeserving of their time. I've felt this a time or two over the years because my wife and I are a mixed race couple, but never in a establishment as well known and named after a Saint no less. Simply disgusting! Shame",

It was printed on plain paper and could have easily been reprinted and updated. There was a ton of staff but I have had better customer service experiences from a computer. Had the pork chili verde, which was just okay. Quite a bit overpriced. I understand paying for quality or an awesome experience but this was neither of the two.",

I booked a reservation on Open Table, we were seated immediately.  After ordering, it was apparent that they were understaffed and the kitchen was running behind.    I ordered the prime hanger steak with mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables and my wife ordered the salmon superfood with quinoa salad.  We shared the wood fired broccoli with aioli.  After almost an hour, we finally got our food.  My steak was luke warm, potatoes cold, and vegetables undercooked.  My wife's salmon was piping hot, straight off the stove.  The food was delicious, however, sub-par execution in service from both in house waitress and back end kitchen.    At the end of our meal, my wife asked for a box for part of her salmon that she didn't finish.  At the same time, our waitress dropped the check off without asking if we wanted anything further.  Needless to say, I was unimpressed, offended, and will never return.    Maybe it was a fluke, maybe it was because we were sitting on the 2nd floor, maybe it was just our server.  Try it out for yourself.",

First I ordered the wood roasted broccoli salad.  This ended up being an appetizer and it was gone in about 1 minute.  So delicious!  Then we had the baked goat cheese appetizer.  Another yummy experience. Our party of four each ordered something different; the pot roast, the Moroccan meatballs, the pig dip sandwich and the roasted chicken.  Everything was perfect.  The food is out of this world!  So nice that this restaurant is centrally located as my family lives on the west side and it was so easy to get to.  The food is so different than I usually experience in Phoenix.  A very nice change.   I will be going back every time I go to Phoenix from now on.  Dinner for the four of us, including 2 desserts, drinks and a 20% tip came to just under $200.  Very reasonable I think.  The staff (and the valets too!) were friendly and helpful.  The restaurant is a little noisy as some have mentioned but you can still have a conversation without having to struggle.   I still can't stop thinking about that roasted broccoli salad - OMG!",

The local pointed out that St. Francis largely uses locally bought veggies, in particular, while also having great food.  Walking into St. Francis, it's clearly an eclectic, fun environment. The menu is just as attractively unusual -- and every appetizer, drink and dish we ordered was delicious and full of flavor.  The goat cheese appetizer wasa good -- the meatball appetizer was great. The almond margarita was unique, tasty and strong. We also had the roast chicken and pork chop - both were excellent. It seemed a little unusual to have just a piece of chicken on the plate, but the \"sides\" were under the chicken, and on top. The flavor was amazing - the fresh veg made all the difference.  The service was friendly and attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and ready with recommendations. We happened to go at happy hour, which features an impressive range of options - bonus!  Can't wait to return to St. Francis next time I'm in Phoenix.",

Upon entering the ambiance was great, it was lunch time and not filled with too many customers so seating was quick. Our server was a young man who was great. I would recommend this restaurant however because I realized the food was a bit bitter and over-salted, it was the beginning of a bad lunch experience. I noticed upon eating my meal (pork chili verde) The majority of the meat had a lot of fat chunks in it. I could tell the meal was pre-made possibly 4 days prior because of the pockets in the food. It all became valid when I became aware that my meal was not made fresh due to the clear wrap that was melted in the dish, almost as if it was reheated in a microwave and tossed into the oven to thoroughly heat. Left-over food is not what I was looking to spend money on, however I paid my bill & left a tip because our food issue was not with the server.   If your looking for quality, I would not recommend St. Francis. Yes, the name sounds great; but behind the name there is a owner not doing his/her job when it comes to quality control. We will not return.",

I liked the brussel sprout salad...but wasn't a fan of the meatballs at all. Alllllll I could taste was cumin. I actually love cumin so it surprises me that I didn't like it...but that was the only flavor. Needed salt badly too. The saving grace for the meal was the sticky toffee pudding for desert. That started an obsession and now I make it at home. Had it not been for the dessert tho I would have given it maybe 2 stars.

We had a couple issues with our dishes though.   A side order of bacon that we'd requested as \"crispy\" was not, and the skillet pancakes apparently are not made fresh upon ordering? There was some ore made in the kitchen visable from entering the restaraunt and when served they failed to come with the cooked apples and whipped cream on top.  We had to ask for them and server then noticed they were bare .  After all the anticipation it was less than stellar.

I've probably been 6-8 times now - once for brunch and the rest of the times at night - and I simply haven't left with as positive of a feeling if I've not been at HH or not ordered one of the more affordable entrees.   For example, I once went for a friend's birthday dinner and got a fish entree in the $30 range. While it was good, I simply couldn't stomach paying $70 for an appetizer, entree and two drinks. And that was just for me. By the time my husband was factored in, we had spent the kind of money we'd spend for a five-star meal at a nice steakhouse.   Same goes for brunch. While I can excuse paying $10-$13 for an entree if bloodys and mimosas are under $6, I can't if I have to pay $8-$9 just to whet my whistle. That said, I would probably pay $8 or $9 just for that delicious, succulent cinnamon roll. MMM - calories be damned.   Anyway, my friend recently introduced me to HH at St. Francis, where you can get their delicious cocktails (the Black Daisy is a tequila lover's dream) for $5 and food items for as low as $4. The Forbidden Rice Bowl (one of my typical choices to save money after that initial fish entree experience) is only $8 and is both exotic and filling.   There are many who rave about St. Francis and clearly, I like it enough to keep going back, but I just like to pay a little less for it. More money to spend at the tons of other great restaurants nearby!",

    "text": "DELICIOUS!!!  Had an early dinner here about two weeks ago.  To say that the food and the service here were outstanding is a gross understatement.  We started with the housemade baguette and the crispy fingerling potatoes.  The baguette was crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside.  We learned that the bread is baked in the restaurant's wood fired brick oven every night - and we took a loaf home (ask your server!).  The crispy fingerling potatoes were perhaps THE BEST POTATOES I have ever eaten.  Fried to a crispy outside, with a fluffy, tender inside, the potatoes were dusted with just a hint of herbs and sea salt.  The \"appetizer\" was perhaps as much as a pound of potatoes.  We ate so many we almost didn't have room for dinner!  For our entress, we had Wood Fired Stuffed Peppers, Moroccan Meatballs and a meat flatbread.  All entrees were hot, flavorful, and beautifully plated.  The Stuffed Peppers and Moroccan Meatballs were chock full of exotic flavors and the flatbread had an incredible crisp but puffy crust.  For desert, we had chocolate cake and sticky toffee pudding.  My wife and daughter thought the chocolate cake may have been the best they've ever had.  We all thought that the sticky toffee pudding was so sweet and caramelly that it should probably be illegal :-)  The wine and beer list is small, but had excellent choices.  The cost for dinner and drinks for three of us was less than $100.  We will most definitely be back!",

    "text": "My mom and I decided to give this place a try after we saw it on Triple D. I love the atmosphere and the staff was friendly. The waitress was attentive in the beginning but once it got a little busier, we didn't see her again for a while and a different person had to grab our check which took forever. I appreciate that the food is mostly local and you can tell it's fresh. The bread is baked in house which is nice but every piece of bread I tried was hard and chewy. We had the goat cheese as the appetizer which was pretty amazing. As for the entrees, we tried the pork chile verde and the pig dip. They were okay but nothing great for what they charge. I'm disappointed but hopefully I will get a chance to go back and try more flavorful entrees.",

    "text": "I dined at this place last week based on the great reviews here.  I was quite impressed with the place, waiting area and bar.  I was disappointed that there was a 45 min wait on a Wednesday night!  I had an apple martini by the bar while waiting, which was amazing as it tasted very natural with a thin apple slice.    After 30 mins or so, I was seated with my guest.  It was another wait to get the waiter and when we placed the order was another wait as well.  I ordered the pork chop and my guest ordered the roasted chicken. I was unimpressed by either orders when we got it.  For $24 pork chop I expected at least 2 of them and $21 roasted chicken (a drumstick and a thigh) was over priced.  Both orders were good but not worth it's price.    The place has a great ambience and would have drinks during happy hour but I wouldn't eat here again.",

The drinks were spicy and delicious,  what a great start to our morning.  We were seated promptly at noon and Christy was our server.  Bright, Energetic and Happy to serve!  The food was terrific,  hot and as requested.  Coffee and water was constantly refilled and the dirty dishes removed immediately.   All in all, a great place to be!

    "text": "A staple in Phoenix. Usually very good. This time was a little different. It was very busy which I always like.  Our reservation was for 830 and we arrived a little early for a a drink. They were very skimpy on their pours. Very weak drinks. We were sat exactly at 830 and our server was very courteous. Service was SLOW. We waited about 30 minutes before we received our appetizer. It was the hummus appetizer and was very tasty. Served with flat bread. For entree I had the roasted chicken. I thought the flavor was great but skin could have been crispier.  My partner had the pot roast and his comment was it was nothing special.  This is the issue with established restaurants, they sometimes become complacent. I'll be back because I have a gift axed I need to use up.",

When we went on Thursday night it was pretty busy, although the patio was closed (probably a good thing on a summer night). The only downside was that we had to wait a while fire our server to check in on us and others seemed to gaffe the same issue. Not sure if it was unusually buddy for a midweek night, our if they need an extra server or two to help distribute the attention to the customers.   Overall, though, a great experience, we look forward to returning to St. Francis!",

    "text": "I went with an open mind and really wanting to enjoy the restaurant, as I have heard and read nothing but good things. Our party was that of 9 people mostly couples who were ready to drink and eat the night away, which we did, but a few of us went home with upset stomachs, which could have been from any number of dishes we shared before our main course.   Here we go:  Started with multiple Flat breads (Fig, Smoked salmon and cheese) for the table and three bottles of wine, which were fantastic all around. After the breads we decided we had not yet had our fill of the appetizers and decided to order the baked goat cheese that also turned out to be tasty.   For dinner the table ordered multiple dishes that consisted of Seafood Cioppino, The Burger  & Fries, Meatball oven dish, roasted chicken and white fish, which is funny that between the whole group we basically all ordered the same thing in one way or another.   We all shred the dishes and they were all pretty good, but not outstanding, but perhaps this is due to the hype surrounding the restaurant and the overwhelming numbers that praise it as the next coming, but for me i wasn't wowed by anything i had that night and got the same feedback from the other guests. It wa snot that the food was bad, but it wasn't great , which i had expected.   The service was great and the atmosphere was worth the price of admission, but the real problem came later in the evening when another guest and I both got ill and both had shared similar dishes for dinner. I wouldn't normally be so quick to blame the food i had just had before i became ill in this manner, but the fact remains two of us who had the same dishes both left and then had unpleasant experiences later.   Overall the place was cool, and I am sure I will return for drinks only, as I enjoyed the bar area, but when choosing a spot for dinner I am doubting I would suggest it to friends given the end result.",

The executive chef himself helped bring out some of our dishes, what a great atmosphere.  The food was FANTASTIC.  I'm from LA, and was told there \"wasn't a food scene\" in Phoenix.  I now know that isn't True.  Great prices for truly remarkable little dishes.  The goat cheese crostini is unreal.  You must, must, must have it. The pig dip sandwich is fantastic (and huge) The salads are nice, fresh, and beautiful The meatballs are tasty and unique  Check out St. Francis, they deserve your time!",

Arrive on the earlier end of Happy Hour to snag the best table before the crowds arrive.   I love the atmosphere - trendy and classy, without pomp and circumstance. I have eaten there in jeans and a t-shirt, and also in a dress with heels (okay, I lied...I can't walk in heels..but you get the idea.). The staff is friendly and accommodating to special orders, and the Happy Hour also offers great deals on food.   The menu is somewhat seasonal with some dishes staying consistent and some new additions every few months. Personally, I do wish they offered a few more vegetarian/vegan options, but it is still a great place for people of all dietary needs!   Must Try: Fingerling Potatoes.",

I looked on Yelp, I read reviews.....but in the end had a hard time finding a restaurant that fit all the criteria (good atomsphere for a \"table for one\", good food and within hotel shuttle distance).  AWESOME CHOICE.  Thanks to the bartender at the Hilton Suites recommendation.  The atomsphere was awesome with an open airy space, a view of the kitchen when you first walk in.  I was sat on the second (top) level and it was nice with great natural light. I got the farm salad and honestly one of the best salads I have ever had....very light and fresh.  As an entree I got the Pork Verde.....AWESOME.  It came in a cast iron skillet with a side of sweet corn bread (don't forget I am from Georgia).  :)  It also had pablano peppers and some cheese.  Nuff said. After dinner I went back downstairs to the bar to have one last cocktail.  I had the St. Francis Lemonade.....in both stawberry and lemon verbena flavors.  Thumbs up for both.  (Yep I had 2 last cocktails).  Overall all awesome restauant.  I think if I had someone with me and didnt feel so rushed during dinner, it would have gotten the 5 stars.  But they squeezed me in since I was a walk in.  Highly recommend for atomsphere, drinks and food.",

The ambience of this establishment was very cool and hip and had an abundance of open air seating which was most welcome coming into phoenix from Michigan winter that same day.  However, our server was not good at all!  We waited for waters for over 10 mins. and when I needed a refill, because that was all I was drinking, forget about it.  I had to flag another server down while I could see my waitress rolling silverware.  We were eating with another couple and she never asked if we wanted the bill split either which I thought was unacceptable.   Ok...for the food.  I had the pork chili verde which was very flavorful and the cornbread that came with it, I wished I had more of it.  My husband had the kale and Brussel sprouts and kale salad which he thought was very good but the meatballs were just that, nothing special.  Even with the hen egg.  The other couple we were with had been here several times and obviously have had much different experiences than we had because I don't think I would go back unless it was for a cocktail because they had a pretty good looking list and the bar area had tables and space to mingle.",

    "text": "Conveniently located on Camelback Road just a block from the light rail, St. Francis seems to be one of the new hot spots in the general downtown area as they were packed on Sunday morning for their jazz brunch. It's still hot in Phoenix (even though it's mid-October), so we decided to wait for a table inside. In just under half an hour, we were seated up on their second floor dining deck. The space was very nice with exposed brick, steel, and lots of natural light. Service was friendly, the atmosphere was local and cozy, and the menu looked pretty good.  While I enjoyed our time here, I feel like perhaps I didn't order the right thing. I was talked into the special of the day, which was supposed to be a pork shoulder confit w/ poached eggs and potatoes. However, the pork was really just really carnitas (slightly dry from being seared); a little on the heavy side. The poached eggs were also cold when they came out and were a little overdone. The potatoes were the definite highlight. I feel like I should have either gone with the smoked salmon flatbread which my friend ordered (and was delicious from the bite of it I had) or perhaps their benedict or wood-oven baked pancake. They also serve lunch and dinner, so I'll be sure to try them again next time.  They take reservations for lunch and dinner via Opentable which is good, and it looks like they've got a good happy hour, too. 3.5 Stars",

The service from the servers was a bit slow but they were friendly! Our bill came out to be $30 so for us it wasn't worth coming back for brunch. However, we're willing to try it for dinner especially since our toddler can eat for free. That's what earned them the third star.",

We took a seat on their patio and ordered a drink.  I ordered one of their signature cocktails with strawberry's and basil.  The waiter warned me that the drink was very strong and sweet,  since I like strong drinks I went for it.  This drink was terrible. TERRIBLE!!!! Not to mention I had to shell out about 12 buck with tax and tip for this undrinkable concoction.  Let me just say I am not dissatisfied because it was overly strong or sweet.   But rather because it was disgusting.  This is where St Fancis loses one full star from me.    Once we were seated our server was very attentive and nice.  We were seated at a table right inside the door next to a lager table set into this glass alcove.  It looked very cool but once the birthday party with eight ladies took their seats this alcove turned into a megaphone projecting everything this group of ladies said right into our faces.  It was so uncomfortably loud that it was actually painful to my ears.  I found myself holding a hand over the ear closest to them.   We could hardly hold  a conversation.  I ordered a salad to start and requested it without the bacon, the kitchen either did not get this request or overlooked it, because my salad arrived covered in pig.  The goat cheese appetizer was pretty good. The forbidden rice and the pork chop were excellent.  If I were only reviewing our entrees then this place would have gotten five stars.     All in all we dropped around $100 for two people.  I am in no hurry to eat here again.  Although the entrees were so tasty that I may be inclined to order just those again to go!",

    "text": "Wow, what a disappointment.  Made plans to have lunch with a friend. I picked St. Francis after seeing a review of them in The Echo. I was quite embarrassed.  Before making the date, I called the restaurant several times to ask some questions. No one would ever answer the phone, but the voice mail would pick up with a message about gift cards or something, so I knew they were atleast still in business.   My friend and I headed over for a late lunch, hoping to miss any crowds. The hostess handed us the menu. At first I thought there must be a mistake. There wasn't much there. The hostess heard us say we wanted a baguette, so she brought one out, with two glasses of water. The server, Patty (sp), came by. I ordered tea, she asked if I needed sweetener and I said yes. The sweetener never came. Neither did any refills. When our food came out, which was delivered by the manager, we had to ask for refills from him. Patty never checked on us once during the meal. She did finlly come by and clear a few dishes nd get us a box. We sat their for quite some time waiting for the check, still with no drinks. Patty was standing over by the kitchen snacking on something, so I asked another server for the check. The service was some of the worst I have received in the downtown area.  I called the restaurant today to give my feedback and see what kind of response I would get from management. That would determine if I would ever return to this place, as I really wanted to like it. Tried calling before the doors opened for lunch. Once again, no answer. Tried a couple more times, no answer. Finally, at 2pm today, Eva picked up the phone! I asked for the owner or manager. She asked who was calling and I identified myself as a customer. She came back on the phone and let me know the manager was too busy and asked for my nme and number. I told her not to bother, but let the manager know they had lost a customer.  While the food was pretty good (meatballs and salmon flat bread), the service from Patty was dismal. She is best suited for someplace Like Dennys, although I have never even received service this bad there.   Don't waste your time and money on this place. Too many other places in the area that are much better.",

    "text": "I love this place!  Have taken friends here for brunch for the past several months and every single time, my friends have loved it.  This is a perfect BRUNCH spot!  I usually get the omelet or the scrambled egg dish and both come with crusty french bread that is just dee-lish.  The meals are plentiful, delicately balanced in flavors and just simply yummy.  Iced coffee is always strong and the mimosa's sing beautifully on a saturday morning!  The ambience is quite lovely in this restaurant.  Mixture of brick walls with modern undertones.  The restaurant is bright and airy and has a beautiful outside eating area as well.    My only complaint is the service.  It never is fast enough, although everybody is always very friendly.  I have learned to ask for the check when I get our meal to ensure that we are not left with empty plates for too long.  I wish they would beef up their service (although yesterday's brunch was a slight bit better in speed).  All in all, I highly recommend St Francis as a brunching spot!  Enjoy!  ps - they take reservations - highly recommended.",

The cocktails are high-quality, and I especially like the Lemonade - made with vodka, pomegranate syrup, and fresh-squeezed lemonade, it's very refreshing. The wood-fired flat breads have a perfect blistered crusts and seasonal vegetables. The flat breads are high quality and my favorite item on the menu (order the market vegetable). The meatballs (Moroccan Spiced Meatballs) are delicious and so unique.  Go for happy hour and try everything, the prices are great for HH, $5  libations. The reason they don't get 5 stars is the 2nd floor is very warm.",

It wasnt that we wanted anything comped but i felt that acknowledging it would have been friendlier.  they also charge a lot for outside desserts!",

    "text": "Met a friend for lunch here today (Thursday).  It was my first time here but she'd been there for brunch many times and was missing it.    I had the chicken salad sandwich which was really fantastic.  I am usually a little apprehensive to try a chicken salad at a place that I'm not familiar with but it just sounded so good: zatar spice, currants, pine nuts, arugula, tomato, and lemon vinaigrette.  The bread was fabulous and it was really good sized.  It was served slightly warmed and that made it even better.  It was just yummy.  It came with a choice of sides and I chose the fries.  I loves me some fresh cut fries!  These were awesome!    Now, the entree was a $12 menu item but I didn't mind since the portion was quite large (I took half with me) and the fries were abundant enough to share and it was just that good.  The whole meal really could have been shared between the two of us.  My friend ordered the corn flatbread (tomato, goat cheese and walnut pesto) and this was fabulous as well.  The bread was very nice but the center did get a little soft making it a little difficult to eat with one hand (but not impossible).  My friend actually managed quite well while holding her 4  1/2 month old baby in her lap.  The service was wonderful; everyone was quite friendly and attentive and made sure that our needs were being met.  We did not have to ask for a thing.    The parking was limited, but they did provide complimentary valet (minus the tip of course).  I'm glad that I finally got to try St Francis as I'd moved from central Phoenix just when it opened.  This place is just another incentive to move back.  :D",

We only had one lunch in the Phoenix area, so this was it.  Actually, it was Sunday brunch, so the crowd was mixed with families, couples, and at least a couple of tables that seemed to be recovering from Saturday night.  I might have liked it more than the kids did.  They both got the Iron Skillet Pancake, and declared it to be good, although it didn't seem like the greatest pancake they'd ever had.  I enjoyed a nicely spicy Bloody Mary before the pork chile verde. I thought the chile verde was outstanding.  Really nice spice and flavor, with plenty of tender pork.  My wife had the salmon and quinoa and said it was quite good.  Loved the decor, the drinks menu, and the general vibe of this spot. Would certainly return on another trip to Phoenix.",

But, St. Francis sent me a gift card for a second go-around and I have to say my experience was MUCH better.  Our waitress was great, attentive, and super friendly...five stars for the service.  I ordered the meat flat bread, my companion ordered the chile burger.  The flatbread I wouldn't get again, mainly because it was really greasy and a little on the unhealthy side for me.  The burger my friend got was cooked PERFECTLY (this was the issue last time).  The wine (Albarino) was DELISH and my friend's Dark and Stormy was on point.  I would come back to this place definitely during happy hour and I'd like to try dinner as well.  I'd make it a point to sit at the bar or the ground floor and avoid the mezzanine as that is where I think the service lacks the attentiveness needed.  Thanks, St. Francis.  I'll be back. :)",

Since the little sister is paying for dinner, I'm not complaining. =)  It was closer to 8pm by the time we made out to St. Francis. My sister called ahead for reservations. Despite there being no line out front, it was pretty packed.  The ambiance is intimate, a great place for a first date. But, I'd suggest sitting away from the entrance, as it could get potentially cold and the tables closest to the door just felt awkward.  For a starter, we got the fingerling potatoes. I'd order those again. Main meal for me was the roasted chicken. For the sister, the pot roast. Both were great choices. As for dessert? Cheesecake in the jar! Delish!  I even bought a loaf of bread to take home. They have excellent bread! Crusty outside and a moist, chewy inside. This carb lover was a happy girl!  As far as first impressions go, St. Francis did great. Looking forward to the next time I'm in Phoenix, to try more items on the menu.",

We stated with the kale and Brussels sprout salad. While it did have plenty of kale the Brussels sprouts were just shavings, it had a healthy dose of a balsamic base dressing contrary to the menu. $10  We also had the aforementioned $2 bread with olive oil, the menu calls it a baguette but it was sour dough.  For the mains I had the Salmon super food. Pan seared salmon over a quinoa salad with some edamae in it. The Salmon was nothing special and the quinoa was good. $22  We also had the Forbidden Rice bowl, The rice was mostly sweet and not spicy the veggies were nicely roasted but nothing too special. $13  Overal a fun diversion but I am not in a rush to go back.",

    "text": "I've been to St. Francis twice now, the my more recent experience weighing heavier in the reason for my 2 star review.  My first experience with St. Francis was nothing to write home about, they were overcrowded on a Saturday night so my friend and I sat at the bar (where you think you'd get good drink service) however, they ran out of both iced tea and lemonade after drinking one Arnold palmer. The bartender then ignored us most of the night because neither of us had ordered alcohol.  More recently, I visited St. Francis again (I'll try anything twice) for Arizona Restaurant Week 2015. The menu looked great, but was a let down. The first course, I had the Parmesan Risotto, while my two friends each got the Wood Roasted Peaches. Neither friends liked the salad mixture that came with the peaches. I did enjoy the risotto, however price relative to portion, I was disappointed.  Next up I had the Sea Scallops, it's pretty hard to mess up scallops, and I was feeling some seafood that night. Both friends of mine had ordered the Wood Roasted Pork Loin, which they enjoyed although it looked like something that came out of a TV dinner. When they brought out the scallops I was immediately disappointed to see how small the entree was. It had 3 dime sized scallops on it which were dry and had very little flavor.  Lastly, the desserts, we had gotten two Strawberry Shortcakes and one Sticky Toffee Pudding. The shortcake was another disappointment, there was approximately 1-2 strawberries sliced up next to a dinner biscuit with sugar on it. There was very little sauce and the bread was incredibly hard without the strawberry syrup to soften it. I did not taste the Toffee Pudding, although the two friends who did thought it was mediocre at best.  Overall I was very disappointed with this restaurant and will not be returning in the foreseeable future. Much better quality food can be found elsewhere, and with a cheaper price tag.",

Goat cheese app. Delicious.  Ordered two glasses of wine. Get them.   20 mins.... flag someone down to order food! Please! Ok, he was attending to the people by the bread... ok... they don't have a table yet?  Ordered food. Wine empty.. where is the waiter?? Flag him down again. Oh, and can we get a refill on water? Sure!  Wine comes. No water. Wait .. wait ... wait... oh can I get you something else? Yes.. wine is empty again and still no water...  On a $135 check between 3 people, this is not an inexpensive place. But I can go somewhere a lot less expensive with equitable food and get better service. I'm not asking to be treated like a queen. Just want my water refilled and question if my wine should be.  I can't dock the food at either of Aaron Chamberlain's restaurants. Just the service sucks.",

Very happy that they noted what dishes were vegetarian, dairy free, vegan, and gluten free!!!!  Thank you!!  The pineapple/lemonade/club soda non-alcoholic drink was delicious.  Would recommend!    The building used to be a bank, and there is an old safe in one of the bathrooms.  The sink is also really cool!    Would love more vegan and gluten free menu options for the future.",

    "text": "Im a bit torn. I really wanted to LOVE this place.. maybe i came on an off day, im not sure.. To start, i waited at the front for 30min. Everyone just stared and nobody helped me. Soon after i asked one of the cooks if we seat ourselves he said no a host will be with you. About 15min later a girl comes up. She tells me its a 45 minute wait.. 45 minutes and the place is empty!  A few minutes later she seats me. So much for 45minutes lol. The food is alright, its a different taste. Unique flavors but i feel they lack in depth..  I started off with the fingerling potatos which i wasnt expecting but pretty good. They are great to share but everyone said they were crispy? I was a little confused on this? Mine were not crispy in fact i could have made mashed potatos with them. Still good tasting either way. I ordered the pig dip next seems how it was highly recommed on yelp. The reviews made it sound so good.. but i was really disappointed. The mustard over powered the sandwhich and the au jus lacked a lot of flavor. I even added salt and pepper to kind of help it but still didnt do it justice.. I had one little strip of bacon that i wouldnt even know i had if i wasnt looking for it. The bread was good. I ordered the salad instead of french fries because i had already ordered the fingerling potatos. The salad was a terrible mistake. It tasted like acid basically. Was not happy.. The service was good, the waiter made sure my water was filled and didnt run low. He packaged my stuff for me, and brought me fresh au jus. Props to Daniel for the good service. I dont know if id be back though. The table next to me which was about 5 inches away seemed to love this place..  Honestly i was really confused as to why..? Also if your like me and you dont like valet service or perfer not to use it your forced into it. The guy told me i HAD to do valet service or i couldnt eat here. Ive had bad experience with valet service and i can park my own car. Forcing someone to do valet service is a bit much.. I really wanted to love this place but i think ill pass.",

    "text": "Oh, St. Francis, how can you get is so right, but so wrong all at the same time?!?!?  I particularly love their HH menu with delicious meal choices stolen right from their regular menu for under $10 and $5 cocktails before 6pm every day, even on weekends. To have a great HH in Cenpho, you've got to have good food options and good drink options, not just one or the other.   I've ordered close to half of the items on their menu and hands down, my favorite is the chicken salad sandwich. I usually order it sans toast, and without the bread. The dressing on the chicken salad is delicious, but slightly over powering, so I also suggest asking for half of the dressing. I also enjoy the Meatball appetizer, but I would suggest sharing this one with a couple of people. It's basically two or three big meatballs, while delicious, I've usually had enough after one and am ready for my chicken salad.  I always enjoy their vegetables; they're oh so delicious, perhaps even up in the amazing category. This has been hit or miss for me, but I usually try to get them to serve whatever their vegetable is that day. I enjoy St Francis for their fresh and delicious flavors, they can do some great things with veggies here, the trouble is they don't ever seem to want me ordering them. I'm at about 50 / 50 when it comes to them subbing out veggies for the fries, so when they don't seem to want to accommodate, I generally get the side salad instead. They usually give me some response like, the kitchen can't make you a side of vegetables, that dish comes with either fries or a side salad, and I ultimately give in on the salad.   Honestly, why do you need to be so b*tchy about subbing out fries for vegetables, as if there is no kitchen back there. I'm not asking for free food, charge me for the change and call it a day. Is it impossible for you to imagine someone might NOT want to eat fries!?!?!   On one occasion, I was here with a large party of 15 or so for a birthday meal. We made reservations and requested that separate checks be accommodated; well, it appears there was a breakdown between the person who made the reservation and the wait staff who apparently don't like doing separate checks. They refused to accommodate this request, and it started to get awkward. I was not looking to make a big deal out of it, I took care of the bill myself, and went on about our evening without upsetting the nights festivities, but that could have been handled better, much, much better than me paying for everything myself.  A few notes to St. Francis operations. Why is it so difficult for your staff to accommodate something other than fries with a chicken salad sandwich? You're a restaurant, you make food, I want food, please make me the food, so I can eat the food and leave happy.  Why take a reservation with the stipulation of accommodating separate checks and then have your wait staff groan about how they can't do separate checks?  Staff should be accommodating where they can, I don't feel I'm being unreasonable here to expect to be able to order what I want to order, and pay how I want to pay.  I guess the moral of this story is, if you want to come with a large group, they will probably make a big deal out of it, so be prepared. If you want to change up your meal with something as *crazy* as vegetables, good luck. With all that in mind, I still think St. Francis is one of my favorite spots. I'll be back by myself for sure, I might even bring my friends, but only if I'm planning on covering the check.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!",

We were not used to extravagant or gourmet foods so unfortunately we did not care for our meal. We asked for the bill and felt horrible for leaving the plates barely touched as they did an amazing job in the preparation. We did not want to complain as it was not the restaurants fault but our own. The waiter asked if something was wrong we kept insisting no feeling embarrassed for not eating our plates. He continued to ask and offer something else on the house we felt to guilty and kept saying no. Finally I cracked and said it was perfect the food was just to different for us. They gave us a gift card and macaroons on the house which was beyond accommodating. Later I gave them to my mom and returned with her for Mother's Day she and I had an amazing time and enjoyed our meals as the menu changes often. Since I have returned alone and with other friends and family and we all love this place the upstairs and open view with patio really sets the mood. You can go for a crazy busy happy hour or during quieter times with friends. I always refer newbies and out of towners here I hope this restaurant remains apart of Phoenix for a long time it's a great foodie place with an upscale LA feel to it. Staff is amazing I wish I could remember the waiters name he definitely deserved a compliment to the manger they truly go out of their way for their customers.",

    "text": "Wanted to write a rave review but unfortunately our experience was disappointing. We visited the St. Francis about two years ago, loved it, and drove 45 minutes for this return visit. On this visit, the hostess was very pleasant and accommodating, however it was downhill from there. We waited at least 10 minutes for our drinks. The service did not improve. Our crispy fingerlings appetizer were tasty but barely warm. My husband enjoyed his pig dip sandwich. I ordered the mushroom omelette. It was good, but not as described. The menu noted roasted mushrooms with leeks and goat cheese. The omelette I received was mushroom with mozzarella cheese and a tomato based sauce. It also came with a large amount of fingerlings. This was not listed in the menu and it would have been nice if the server had mentioned this when I ordered as we ordered the fingerlings as an appetizer.  The side salad I added to my meal was delicious. Our plates were never cleared. We sat for quite some time after finishing before our waiter asked if we needed anything else. He left the plates on table. We were also not asked if we needed another drink. I probably would have ordered a second glass of prosecco. With all of the brunch choices out there we are not likely to return.",

We live in California and even there we never eat at CPK!!! We decided to drive around and find something on our own.... Behold St Francis!!! The meatballs, the forbidden rice the dessert! OMG.  Jump to 2015.... We are in AZ to work Super Bowl XLIX. All I can talk about to my crew of foodies is Saint Francis. Before all the football madness really starts we find a night and make a reservation. 5 of us. The service is friendly our waiter knows everything and when he describes his favorite dishes our mouths water. We share the mozzarella and beets (fat cheesy balls of love) and the whole roasted cauliflower and corn bread. Gone in minutes!!!  I have the forbidden rice (again after 3 years) still amazing, the rest had Parmesan risotto with chicken, roasted salmon superfood, the roasted chicken, the garden chicken and the egg. Not much talking as well scarfed down this delicious meal. We had cocktails and beer and wine and enjoyed the atmosphere and to top of such a tasty evening we had chocolate cake and STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING!!! My spoon just couldn't  get enough!  We are in Phoenix for another 8 days and hope to get back for another meal or TWO!!!",

I've never been dissatisfied with anything at St. Francis before, but it is highly unlikely I'll go back after this with so many other great choices in the area.",

My friends had the baked goat cheese which they said was amazing (you can never go wrong with goat cheese).  I love the ambiance of this place. They have a good selection of wine/cocktails.",

    "text": "I met an old friend for dinner at St Francis and we had a great time! The atmosphere was friendly and posh.  The space itself was very modern and trendy.  (Yes, the bathroom sink was very cool as other reviewers have noted.)   We sat downstairs, at a table close to the bar.  As the night progressed, it did get a bit chilly at our table since the large rolling door was open at our backs.  That was probably the only negative thing I can say about the space.  If we sat further in toward the back of the restaurant it wouldn't have been an issue, and truly it wasn't that big of a deal.     As for drinks, we were not very adventurous.  My friend had Stella Artois beer and I had a couple glasses of the house red wine.   Surprisingly, the house red was quite tasty & very reasonably priced.   The waitstaff was attentive, but not overly so.  They kept our water glasses filled and cleared plates efficiently, while giving my friend and I plenty of space to talk and catch up.   The food was pretty fantastic.  Nothing super-inventive;  but it was all made with high quality, seasonal ingredients that were combined in a very intelligent way.   We shared everything we ordered, so I was very happy to get a good sampling of flavors.  We ordered the baked goat cheese as an app, any it was so good.  Basically, it tasted similar to a melted caprese salad.  The warm goat cheese was floated over a tomato based, marinara type sauce.  Then, it was topped with a pesto relish and served with a side of sliced toasted baguettes.  Yum!   The entrees we ordered were the salmon and quinoa and the burger with a side of the fingerling potatoes.  Again, both were perfectly prepared and totally delicious.  The salmon was precisely cooked and the paired well with the quinoa \"salad\" that was underneath it.  The quinoa had some fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, soy beans, red onion and was garnished with thin, slightly tart watermelon slices.  It was dressed with a soy vinegarette, too.  It was very fresh-tasting and light.  Perfect!  The burger was as good as everyone reviewed it.  The brioche roll was soft, rich, and buttery.  The meat was perfectly made to order (medium rare), and topped with the heavenly cheese and bacon.  Very decadent...this was an exceptional burger.  The potatoes were crave-able and deserving of the hype.    For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding and it was very tasty.  I would describe it as a dome of spiced cake or bread pudding, topped with a  (I'm guessing) toffee glaze and served with a spoonful of gelato.  It was the perfect end to a very satisfying meal.  I would go back to St. Francis in a heartbeat!",

I simply adore the chocolate chip cookies!  I love both these items and even though I've been here multiple times I haven't tried anything else because of my love affair with these items!  The atmosphere is charming and really comfortable.  If Aaron the owner is there he is really nice and friendly.  Get there soon!",

Great waitress and service and the pork chili was amazing!!!  BUT the last time that we came in with a couple of friends last Saturday just to have a drink at the bar wasn't so great! We didn't order any food just drinks. We sat down and didn't even get a hello,from the bartender.  A guy ( that looked like maybe a manager) took our drink order so when our drinks came, all we got was \"are you ordering any food\" from our not so friendly girl bartender. My Bloody Mary was super salty and I put it a side as I was not going to drink it. We sat there about 45 minutes so my friends could finish their drinks, still not one word from the bartender. No \" how you doing\" or \" I see your not drinking your drink, everything ok?\" Nothing!! Very unfriendly, grouchy like she didn't want to be there or be bothered by anyone. Very disappointing!!! She really needs an attitude adjustment. I get that people have bad days but really? Not one word to us on how we are doing or a thank you?! The girl had blonde hair and black glasses on, if I come back imfor sure won't be sitting at the bar if she is wokring.",

The visit started out on the wrong foot as I was tremendously annoyed to find that there was no self-parking.  I nearly abandoned my visit but ended up parking in the mall parking lot across the street and dodging heavy Camelback traffic to cross the street.   I sat on the patio and enjoyed the great Arizona February weather.  Music was playing at a reasonable level (an unfortunate rarity these days). The Pig Dip was overpriced but, arguably, worth it.  That is one seriously delicious sandwich.  I will be returning for sure despite having to jaywalk to get there.",

When I'm in the mood for \"clean, casual but thoughtfully designed and prepared cuisine\" this place will always be a contender.    Surprisingly kid-friendly, by the way.  My eight year old was the only child in the entire place when we dined there, but children will probably enjoy the splendid setting, and they have a small children's section of the menu (4 or five standard items), and kids eat free!  As for me, I had the pot roast, which was served with a well-seared exterior and a fork-flaking moist interior, on a bed of delicious baby bok choy and whipped polenta..  I cleaned the danged plate with no difficulty.  Very rich dark gravy.  Overall, the portion size was above-average.  The artisan baguettes, baked on site (you can walk out with a loaf for $3) were wonderful, with slight tartness.  You can get about a 1/4th of a loaf with dipping oil for a couple bucks off the appetizer menu.  Most entrees ran $14-24, with meal size salads in the 9-12 range, and lovely appetizers in the usual $3-8 range.  Oh, and the sinks in the bathrooms are one of the coolest things I have seen in a restaurant.  A distressed and angled brass or copper sheet serves as the \"sink\" which gives a very cool \"spilling\" effect when the faucet is turned on.  I'm kinda disturbed by the fact that I stared at it for so long.  I was enchanted..",

Very nicely spiced, not too much heat and the pork was very tender and flavorful. Took the option of having 2 eggs on top of it, and I'm glad I did, really good.  The serving size was also very generous.  My wife got the side salad to start with a very good vinegar based dressing which she enjoyed. For dinner, she had the goat cheese appetizer and was happy with it. I tasted it and thought it was good but not mind blowing.  For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding which was very good but not the best I have had.  Westside Tavern in West Los Angeles has the Best sticky toffee in the World!!  Sorry I digress!!   Only reason I didn't give St.Francis a 5 star was the comfort factor, the chairs were very uncomfortable and tables too close together for my liking.  The service was excellent will be back for sure!",

They are very kid-friendly.....ages 10 & Under eat FREE.  St. Francis is a gem in Phoenix. They have worked hard to fill the menu with quality items and that means a lot to my family and I.

    "text": "I wanted to like this place better but I was left wanting.  My girlfriends and I were going to do a night out and chose this as our destination.  Before we arrived we reviewed the menu on their website and identified what looked good.  Additionally I looked though different reviews here to identify what seemed to be the most popular dishes and what I wanted to eat.  We got there through the pouring rain and were surprised to see that the teeny, tiny parking lot has valet parking.  Why?  I really don't understand the need for valet parking when the parking lot is that small.  Anyway, upon entering I noticed the place is super cute.   We had a reservation and we were on time, but we still waited a few minutes for our table to open up, which is normally fine except there really isn't a convenient place for more than about 2 people to wait for their table in the lobby area.  So we stood for about 10 minutes doing an awkward shuffle-dance with other people who were coming and going.  Eventually we're seated and greeted by an outgoing and friendly waiter.  Things immediately went South we when looked at the menus only to discover that almost none of the things listed on their online menu, or even mentioned in the various yelp reviews, were still offered!   I was looking forward to having a pineapple mojito, which our waiter said they didn't offer (despite the fact I saw a clear-as-day photo of one in their Yelp reviews) instead he insisted that the Plantation Tea was what I saw but it definitely wasn't the same drink, not even close.  My friend ordered an apple cocktail, which wasn't even listed on the menu.  We ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer to share, which came out lukewarm, and had a bland, goopy texture that lacked any real depth or zing.  Sadly I see that most people rave about it, so I can only assume ours was a bad batch..?   We didn't even finish it, it was that blah.  The only entree that I was really looking forward to on the menu was the seafood cioppino, but the waiter said that was one of the things that had just been removed from the menu so it wasn't available either.  Instead I had to go with my distant second choice, a Hangar Steak.  Which at $25 was cooked perfectly, but it was small.  Additionally it was served on a bed of bitter roasted root vegetables and grainy lukewarm mashed potatoes, very disappointing.  My friend had wanted the pumpkin soup (no longer offered) but ordered the Forbidden Rice Bowl instead, which she really liked a lot.  We ended our night by ordering a carrot cheesecake that was offered on the new menu the waiter returned to tell us that, sadly, it wasn't available that night either.  (This experience was starting to resemble the Monty Python 'Cheese Shop' skit.)  Instead our waiter, who I will mention was as patient as a saint with our growing disappointment over the random menu changes and item unavailability, brought us out a Sticky Toffee Pudding, on the house, instead.  It was passable, but I guess it was just pre-destined to fall flat after all the lukewarm, overpriced disappointment we'd been served that night.  I guess you could say we were just feeling a little bit grumpy at that point over not getting a single thing that we were looking forward to.  Oh well...  Now, *I* probably won't be back, but I don't intend this review to be a black cloud over this restaurant; it has promise, and like I said it is super cute inside and our waiter was very friendly.  I just think we our expectations were already set high before we got there and when the dominoes started falling in the wrong direction they kept going in the wrong direction and the smallest negative things, like my bitter root vegetables, tiny steak and the bland appetizer, were amplified.    While I totally understand that menu changes can't be reflected in old Yelp reviews I'd encourage the management to make sure to update their website to reflect menu changes as soon as they happen.  That way diners, who are finicky and through enough to review the restaurant's website before they arrive, will know in advance what their dining options are and won't be sorely disappointed to discover everything's been changed in the meantime.",

Over an hour for our food. The potatoes weren't cooked all the way. We were there a total of two hours for the two of us with normal breakfast and one drink each. Waiter was nice, but no sense of urgency from anyone that worked there.  Two other women and I were in line for the restroom and one of the cooks came out wafting his nose and saying, \"you might want to let it clear out a bit before anyone of you use it.\" And laughed and went back to the kitchen.  Not going to return or recommend anyone to eat there.",

It's well designed, the servers are very professional but what really set me over the top was your Salmon dish. The top coating or sugar crust is absolutely amazing. I've never had anything like it. How did Chef create such a masterpiece? Is there any way Chef would be open to sending the recipe or letting me know how he created the almost hard shell crust on the top?",

    "text": "The ambience, fab drinks and finger-licking burger make this one of my fav restaurants in the area.  Only reason I can't give them a solid 5, is because overall, The food just isn't as fabulous and consistent as it used to be. But take advice from fellow locals who visit here often, order the 'right' thing (did I mention the burger?!) and you won't be disappointed.  Got friends in town? This is the place to bring them!   The 2 story building has an awesome design - its got a perfect mix of exposed brick walls, large floor to ceiling windows and a retractable front glass wall that they open up on warm days.   Best Seats - At the bar if theres just 2 of you, or outside on the pretty patio. Skip the top floor entirely - in fact, don't bother eating there at all if they try to put you upstairs. It lacks the ambience that makes St Francis special, and the service is always slower.  Best Bevs - The Santa Rosa!!! Its the epitome of the perfect, refreshing summer drink. Smooth vodka, muddled with ruby-red grapefruit, basil and Elderflower liquor. Yum! They also do an awesome bloody mary.  Best Bites -  French Onion Burger, Pork Chop, Salmon, Egg Sandwich, Fingerling Potatoes wih yummy aioli and Baked goat cheese. You may be tempted by the sound of the Pork Chile Verde, and if it was a year ago, I'd say dont order anything else. But these days, it tends to come out over-cooked and chewey and lacking the yum it used to flaunt. Love burgers like me? Then you absolutely have to have the finger-licking-good St Francis French Onion burger! :) Just the burger alone is worth 5 stars! They use top quality ground beef and always cook it perfectly to order, served on a warm brioche bun, topped with smokey bacon, greens, gruyere cheese, crispy onion strings and a magic sauce. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  Best Times to Go - Between 3-6 for happy hour. Its quiet,  you get seated right away, and the service is always quick. I love their brunch on the weekends, especially when they have live music. Just get there early and be patient - it gets busy for brunch!  Tip - They have an amazing wood burning fire oven and cook fresh, crunchy loafs daily - order one on your way out!",

    "text": "Over the summer I caught an episode of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and Guy was at a restaurant in Phoenix that served the most amazing looking pancake ever.  Since I grew up in Phoenix, though I almost never go back, I made a mental note of the restaurant on the off chance I would have an opportunity to go there.  Flash forward to late December and I'm booking a trip to Phoenix to see my close friend and his family, and while we're on the phone talking about the trip he says that he wants to take me to St. Francis for breakfast on Sunday.  What a happy coincidence!!!  Especially since my mental note had failed me until just that moment.  Back home in L.A. if you aren't at a breakfast spot by 9am, then you can expect long lines getting in to any restaurant.  St. Francis doesn't even open until 9am, so we arrived at 9am on the spot as we were a party of six and needed to make sure we got a table.  We arrived just in time and were seated in their loft area.  While we were up there I realized that the restaurant was in a converted oil-n-lube garage and still had the roll-up door.  Without hesitation I ordered the Iron Skillet Pancake.  I knew it would be sweet and I would need something salty to counteract it, so I made sure that my husband ordered a side of bacon.  And boy was I right!  The pancake was pure decadence.  It was fluffy, with the chocolate chunks melted perfectly inside.  The warm caramel apples were on top and merged with the maple syrup.  And the creme fraiche added the needed creaminess to the whole dish.  My only regret is that I was dieting, so I limited how much of the pancake I would eat, and ended up leaving slightly more than half on the table.  I had originally hoped that my husband would finish it, but he was full of sweetness from his own breakfast, and turned off by the chocolate.  I definitely need to go back when I'm not dieting.  One big positive of St. Francis is that children under 10 eat for free.  And they also get to order the Iron Skillet Pancake.  Its the same size as the adult version, but it doesn't come with the caramel apples or the whipped creme fraiche.  My husband decided to indulge in the cinnamon roll.  It was probably at least six inches long.  I only had a small bite, but it was yummy.  And my husband was thankful that I had ordered him that side of bacon as he too needed something to counteract the sweetness in his mouth.  My friend, on the other hand, chose to go the more traditional route and ordered the eggs benedict.  That said, St. Francis foregoes with the traditional Canadian bacon, and instead lets you choose between prosciutto, smoked salmon, and avocado.  The dish looked delicious and I did get to taste the crispy potatoes which appeared to be fingerling potatoes that pop when you cook 'em.  My friends are always trying to find ways for me to come visit them more often, and I think they might have found their hook.  I can't wait to go to St. Francis again for breakfast, and want to try them for the other meals of the day too.  Yummers!

    "text": "I've eaten at St. Francis several times.  Having said that, it's usually an overall good experience and the food is usually wonderful except for last night.  Now it happens...sometimes restaurants just get it wrong one night, but last night...literally they got it all wrong.  With hardly anyone in the place, we were made to wait 45 minutes for a table inside, and then we were sat by the door which was basically the same as sitting out in the heat.  It took the waiter 15 minutes to even come our way and we gave him our whole order at once because, by then...we were starving.  We both ordered salads but only mine came out first...i tried to find the server to ask where my date's salad was but he never came back.  I had to ask a hostess (both of whom are super sweet and helpful) to get our waiter and have him get her salad.  His response was...i thought that was your main course...what did we learn in school about assumptions?  plus it doesn't matter if it was her main course...maybe she wants it right away?  Use your words...ask your patrons what they prefer.  One of the things I love about this place is that they use local veggies.  Awesome right?  Well...sometimes those veggies aren't great.  It does happen but when we say hey, this salad doesn't taste right because the heirloom tomatoes taste mealy and overripe, you take that away and take it off my bill...you don't walk away, ignore us even more and pretend like you could give a shit.    There is no more awkward feeling at a restaurant than having to confront your server because the food isn't right.  You think I want to have to tell you that your 14$ salad tastes bad?  No, I don't.  You think I want to sit there and eat mine while my date sits there drinking water because she's been put off from eating anything else?  No, I don't.  As a business owner I have to say that one thing that just doesn't sit right with me is when your employees are not trained on what to do when someone has an issue with your service or product.  It's simple, you remove it from the bill and see if they would like something else.  No manager was anywhere to be found.  No one but hostess came by to try to help us find another vegan option to eat.  Seriously, if not for the professionalism of the hostesses, I'd never come back to this place after the other night's mess of a meal.",

Poor service, shrinking beverage portions and sub par food quality/prep. Ordered the Chicken sandwich, a number of 1-2 inch bones left in. I told the waiter, he seemed to care less. It was still on my bill at the end. In central/mid town Phoenix there are far better restaurants now. While SF was once great, it is far from it now. Personal and Business dollars are going elsewhere, sorry SF you dropped the ball repeatedly.",

    "text": "Dear St. Francis,  If you were a stripper and 5-stars were dollar bills, I'd be makin' it rain on you right now.  Thank you for a brunch feast that shall go down in history: consistency, top-notch quality, versatility, and prompt, friendly service, all to the sounds of Radiohead, The Black Keys, and Fleet Foxes.  My sister and I began by splitting the homemade buttermilk biscuit, which came out on two plates (without us asking), each half-biscuit topped with a sunny side up egg and doused in creamy, delicious, herbed onion gravy. I could've sworn I was somewhere directly below the Mason-Dixon line every time I took a bite. Absolutely nail'd it.  Next up was the iron skillet pancake - crisp on the outside, thick, warm and fluffy on the inside, studded with dark chocolate, topped with spiced apples, creme fraiche, and a light drizzle of maple syrup. Either this is a pancake, or those things I've been calling pancakes my whole life are pancakes, but not both. Regardless, this is the new standard to which all pancakes shall be held.   Lastly, I inquired about ordering the smoked salmon flatbread, even though it wasn't on the brunch menu. They made it happily, and we demolished it, happily. St. Francis actually makes the best crust I've ever had, and topped with cheese, lemon, capers, onion, creme fraiche and smoked salmon... it makes a bagel, lox & cream cheese look like an inedible compilation of garbage.  All in all, each dish was incomparable to the next, but of equal, fantastic quality and taste. Picking a favorite would be damn near impossible, so I think I'll just come back and order blindly off the menu, because St. Francis can do it all, and they do it best.  *throws a handful of singles in the air*",

We had a reservation for 7 people at 10:30am for brunch in the mezzanine. When we arrived (a few minutes before 10:30) we found out that they had decided to accommodate a party of 20 and move us down stairs, I get it, businesses need to make money, but the table they were going to give us was occupied by a group that they made a reservation for at 10am. Did they really expect a group to be in and out in 30 min before our reservation? Long story short on a 112 degree day we waited over 35 minutes standing in the hostess area before finally giving up and leaving. At no point did the hostess or the MOD offer us an apology or a remedy without us having to ask to speak to the Manager. I can't help but be reminded of an episode of Seinfeld \"you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to hold the reservation, and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding of the reservation.\"",

We were out for a pre-bachelorette weekend lunch and Hannah and Shelley were so excited for the bride and asking about our bachelorette weekend plans. It felt like we were among friends with them. So sweet! Then, at the end of our meal, they brought out a beautiful three-layered cake dessert with real flowers on top, on the house! It was such a sweet surprise. I don't even need to mention that the food was also amazing, because you should eat here, or do your event here, based on how amazing the service itself is.",

    "text": "I think this will be the longest review I've ever left for any restaurant (yet)! So bear with me please :-) We went to St. Francis for the first time today instead of our weekend routine \"Flower Child\" treat. Mainly just to try something new. And here is what we ordered and my experience:  1) arrived at 5 so the Happy Hour was on, so I first started with a Pinot Noir. For $5, it was a great wine. I would call it a happy, young, fruity wine with a bit of a sour finish. Later on I ordered a glass of their Merlot and regretted big time (but I hope you don't make my mistake unless you're heavily invested in Merlot wines). Also their wines came out a bit warmer than what it should since they keep them outside (see one of the pics).  2) for the starter, we ordered a Romaine Heart Salad and potato leak soup. Both were excellent (A).  3) for Entrees, we ordered a French Onion Burger, a Forbidden Rice Bowl, and a Moroccan Meatballs and here is my opinion about each dish:  The Burger (B-): it was an Ok burger. I had it medium well and in my first bite I sensed a rush of a fatty after taste in my mouth. The one you would usually get at lower quality restaurants with high fat% beef. I was disappointed. My wife asked if I want to change it but I was already 40% through. She asked to try a bite and as soon as she had one bite she said the same thing but she said the fatty after taste might be from the cheese and not the beef and she was right! I enjoyed my burger much more after I shaved off the cheese. I shared this as a feedback with the waitress and hope they address it cuz it would have otherwise been a solid B+ burger...anyway let's move on. Shall we?  The Moroccan Meatballs (B): overall, it was good but in my opinion it was too cuminny (too much Cumin). The cumin flavor was too dominant that it faded out all the other goodness.  The Forbidden Rice Bowl, with Shrimp (A-): this dish, as my grading suggests, was the best dish over the three that we ordered tonight. The rice was a bit spicy and the vegetables were delicious. The only reason I did not give this dish an \"A\" was that the shrimp was over cooked.  4) for the desert, we ordered the chocolate cake with coffee ice cream (B-). The frosting was too sweet and dense, the cake itself was OK and the ice cream was also too sweet for me. This doesn't mean this would be too sweet for you as well because over the years I've realized  that most people like their deserts to be at least twice as sweet as the way I like mine. So if you're one of those most people, and you've made it through my long review, go for it and bon appetit.  Overall (B+): definitely happy we've decided to try St. Francis. The ambient was excellent, and food and service was good. Bill was under $100 (with tip) which is not bad for how much food and drinks we ordered.",

    "text": "Three stars is generous for food and service.  Ambience, cleanliness, and the restaurant design is 4+ stars... Nerdy modern, clean, hip, and set the stage for what I was expecting from the kitchen.   Let's just say $50 for lunch and you expect something a bit special.  Multiple items on the lunch menu not available at 12:30pm on a Sunday.  I don't get it.    Waited 45 minutes for eggs benedict and a sandwich - - - four people in the kitchen and three tables in the dining room when we were sat. Mind blown why it took so long.   So eggs benedict is pretty simple and it was good, tasted good, good presentation, and I enjoyed it.  Pork sandwich was UNEDIBLE.  The bread was rock hard and GIGANTIC. The human mouth does not open six inches nor can our teeth go through rock hard bread.  It was literally 3/4+ the height of my glass of iced tea.  Just fork and knifed some of the meat and then aborted the mission. It would have been awesome if the bread was bias cut and toasted on the flattop. It came with a salad that had champagne vinaigrette.  I wish at this price point they could splurge for some herbs in the dressing to bring it to life.  Our server touched our table once and then cleared the plates.  He then starts taking another table and leaves us flagging someone down to get our check.  The part that I was surprised about was that he picked up a plate that was barely touched, and he didn't say a word other than asking if she wanted a box to go.   I would think that if a guest doesn't eat the entree you would want to make sure there wasn't a kitchen issue or something.    I waited months to come here and finally was in the area, and I am so disappointed.  I really really thought by the reviews and pictures that it would be a new go to or place to refer people to. I'm glad I came first before making referrals.",

First off we ordered Brie and fig sandwich and guess what they used blueberries not figs and didn't even tell us. We bit into the sandwich and thought that is not fig. When we told our waitress she asked and low and behold no they didn't have figs so they used blueberries. WHAT??? Are you serious. You don't even let your customers know. And the meatballs some were spicy and some not at all. And they were not suppose to be spicy. Not good.",

The entrance of the restaurant can be a bit tricky to find if you park on the side, I walked into the side door the first time I came here but the entrance is facing the street. I should have known better. Customer service here is what you expect from an establishment that was once owned and ran by Aaron Chamberlin & Co, it's prompt, friendly, and wonderful. I've had the pork chile verde and french onion burger on the two visits that I've been here and while I enjoyed the burger, the chile verde was definitely more memorable for me. 10/10 would recommend that. Decent amount of heat, flavorful pork. The flavors just blend well together. Also didn't hurt that you can add an egg on top because one should always add an egg if the opportunity presents itself. Eat here and be merry, there's a lot to like here from the ambiance to the food.",

First, Aaron needs to update the menu for summer.  Then, the food needs to be what it used to be.  Food that was supposed to be hot was cold.  Obviously our waiter let it sit for a long time before he managed to get to the kitchen to bring it to our table.  Sent my cold undercooked fish back, and it came back warm, but still undercooked.  Seared Ahi is great, but seared whitefish?  I don't think so.  The Pinot Grigio was barely chilled.  The waiter poured almost full glasses so he wouldn't have to fill them again, I guess, then plopped the warm bottle on the table so it would get even warmer.  Asked if Aaron was around to talk to him, but he was not there that night.  When the chef's away???  Won't be going back anytime soon.  What happened???",

After making a reservation, we came her for a work event with about 12 people. While they don't have private rooms, they do have an upstairs seating area that was comfortable, secluded and perfect for our party. The atmosphere was welcoming yet a little swanky (just how I like it). The wait staff was attentive, friendly and quick to help us when needed. The menu didn't boast a ton of options, which made my decision on what to order much easier. For apps we had the baked brie and goat cheese, flatbread and potatos which were all very good. For my entree, I had the white fish which was good but a little dry, hence the 4 stars. My colleagues had the forbidden rice which was fantastic. We split a couple of desserts at the end of our meal and they were all very tasty. All-in-all, I would definitely recommend this place if you want good food that's somewhat reasonably priced, in an upbeat atmosphere.",

We got there around 4 and there was a wait so we went to the bar to order a drink. The bar is not big, probably about 12 chairs. All the chairs were taken so we stood by the bar and tried to get the bartenders attention so we could order a couple of drinks, and tried, and tried, and tried. You get the point, so after 10 minutes she finally took our drink order. After about 10 more minutes we received our drinks, a beer and a margarita, not too difficult to make. A couple of seats opened up at the bar so we sat down. We finished our drinks and after about 10 more minutes of waiting with empty glasses we were able to order another round and the meatball appetizer. We received the appetizer and the meatballs were slopped with tons of sauce, I think it was to cover up the dryness of them. They were way over seasoned and I can still taste them in my mouth 7 hours later. Finally after having an empty glass for 20 minutes we decided to remove our name from the waiting list and leave. While we were waiting for our tab, there were people standing behind us that were trying to find out where their server was. They had received their drinks but the server never came back to take the order. They were told all the servers were in a meeting! WHAT! A meeting in the middle of service on a Saturday. We finally received our tab after waiting about 20 more minutes. When we got up to leave the servers finally got our of their meeting. I have experienced bad service before, but this is by far the worst experienced of my life. I would never go back. They should take a lesson on service from The Keg Steakhouse. They have immaculate staff and food. Sorry Diners Drive Ins and Dives, but maybe you should not only rate the food, but the service as well.",

    "text": "Complete disappointment. St. Francis presents itself as an upscale, high-end establishment. It's complementary valet parking; the young hostess and the carefully placed lighting go way out the way to tell you this is a special place. Unfortunately, despite the careful appearance - I had the pork chilli verde and a used Band-Aid, still warm and juicy-- that I hope was from the sauce not the previous owner. Disgust does not describe my experience.  Our server was nowhere to be found.   I alerted Hostess back to my table.  I stopped her as she took my plate, I told her I wanted to talk to a manager.  She told me that she wanted to show it to the chef.  It took some time for anybody to respond. When the manager finally come over she was apologetic, she seemed unsure what to do. But really, how can you fix it--there was a band-aid in my food.  As the customer establishment that attempts project a sophisticated image, I was struck with the absolute absence of customer service and insight. The Band-Aid that ended up in my food was there for a reason: it was covering up something weepy? Bloody? Full of puss?  The band-aid was egregious enough but the genuine lack of concern from the Manager, waitress and chef all made this dining experience the worst ever. I wondered if any one in the kitchen ever wondered just where that band aid went? I began to wonder why there was a band-aid in my chili - did I miss something else? The St. Francis is a complete bust - poor service and unsanitary conditions. I will not ever go back to the St. Francis, I would caution current and future patrons to proceed carefully and examine your dishes closely.  The Valet, the first person you encounter displays no class, I don't care if he's young and tattooed.  When we asked what complimentary means, his response was \"I park your car for free and, if you want, you give me a tip\".  Really?  If the kid has no tact, can't the management intervene and require it?  As for the Manager, please read up on customer service - I 've had better service at Filabertos. The Waitress, please don't abandon your table and check back in from time to time. As for the kitchen staff - clean it up, wear gloves and pay attention. This time it was a band-aid next time it could be something much worse. The St. Francis was a total disappointment; you may want to cross this off your list if you are concerned about your health.  There was no excuse for their lack of responsiveness, they weren't even busy.",

    "text": "St. Francis is the kind of place that I believe will define the near future in restaurant trends, an evolution of the post-recession \"new normal,\" if you will. This is about approachable, comforting dishes prepared excellently - food fit for foodies, but not \"foodie food\" - at a moderate price point (entrees $12-25). And it all happens in a cosy, informal atmosphere that feels like a neighborhood hangout, with exposed brick walls, metal tables, a garage door that makes the bar indoor/outdoor when open, and waiters dressed in jeans and t-shirts. The chef comes from LGO Hospitality, and while this is his own venture, you can certainly see their influence here...there are similarities to Postino, Chelsea's Kitchen, and LGO Pizzeria, in the cuisine and especially in the atmosphere.  The romaine hearts salad is the perfect way to start a meal, with a very light but flavorful dressing, a few slices of apple, the most amazingly thick and crispy bacon, and lots of creamy cheddar. You'll see the flatbread being served at a lot of tables, and for good reason. Firstly, because it's wonderful, with a perfect crust and tasty toppings, and secondly, because at $12 it's a steal...enough for an entree (probably with some left over) or as an appetizer for 2-4 people. The scallop special was amazing - perfectly cooked scallops paired with a lemon and caviar beurre blanc sauce and multi-colored cauliflower. The only mild disappointment was dessert, and less-so because of taste than because of misleading description. The warm sticky toffee pudding was delicious, but it was a little too dry to be a sticky toffee pudding...more like a toffee cake. It was also a little on the small side.  Service was excellent, the vibe was great, and the price was right for the quality of food...it's not your weekly hangout, but it's not special occasion dining either. My prediction is that 2010 will be all about restaurants like this.",

The evening started out OK - we loved the building and overall atmosphere, so wine on the patio was a win.  Upon sitting down (which took 25 addt'l minutes, after the hostess called us in), we ordered the goat cheese and fingerling potatoes.  Both were fine, but nothing exciting.  The bread served w/the goat cheese was hard and five pieces for our group of four was weak.  I have done better fingerlings at home.  None of us were impressed with the entrees - extremely pork heavy, nothing popped.  The pot roast sandwich was heavy and diner-esque, the citrus salad was tiny, the cauliflower flat bread was colorful, but lacked flavor and the ahi tuna sandwich would have even been a little disappointing had I been eating lunch at a resort restaurant.  I am sorry to be so harsh, especially when I am definitely in the minority, but St. Francis did not live up to the sexy building it inhabits, nor the hype.  I gave it a three, because the patio was great and I would go back for a drink - BEFORE heading somewhere else to eat.",

We waited so long to be served even our first glass of water, then we waited to be waited on, then we waited for our drinks. I had to tell the girl cleaning the floor we were waiting for our drink order. Now, neither one of us ordered alcohol, so there's no excuse for us waiting so long for a glass of ice tea and a coke. Funny thing was with all the staff milling about, it seemed only one server was working. There were two women dressed in non-uniforms who appeared to be the managers...neither one seemed interested in making sure their customers were properly being waited on. One woman just kept shrieking she was so upset that one of the staff was leaving. Well, uh hello...why don't you worry so much about your customers??? The waiter finally came back to check on us, and told my husband he'll bring him another ice tea...NOTHING...my husband had to go up to the bar himself to get his refill...amazing, but True. Also, our finished plates sat on our table, never getting cleaned up. I'm sorry, but a sign of a good waitstaff is one that is prompt with service, which also means cleaning up a dirty table. Our appetizer plates didn't get taken until our meal came. Again, it's not like they were crazy busy, and they sure had enough staff, so it must be lack of good management. We did leave a tip, which I argued with my husband about, but he's a former waiter and out of a sense of brotherhood, he will always leave one. Me??? I would have left a penny! Well, if anyone from SF reads this..please work on managing your waitstaff...if you go there, don't expect any prompt service...the food??? it was ok.",

    "text": "Arrived relatively early on Sat. night and waited about 15 minutes for a table. Not bad! The ambience and decor are very urban cool, brick and steel, visually interesting. Tables are a little too close together, but not a deal breaker. Wait staff was friendly and efficient. We had a kiltlifter and an Almond tequila margarita to start....both crazy good. We heard the server at the table next to us really raving up the whitefish of the day, Monkfish.  When our server presented the dish, he also said it was amazing.  I am a big fan of monkfish and he assured me it  was fresh, so I was in! We ordered it and the roasted pork chop.  The pork chop was everything we could have wanted, pink and juicy, super flavorful, the accompaniments were a perfect complement. Sadly, the monkfish was so flavorless, as to be inedible. And there was not much else on the plate that was interesting enough on its own to bother with .  Ok... it happens, BUT a True sign of the very best restaurants, is when the staff has been instructed to Care About when it happens and not just clear a full plate without an inquiry. The upside was I had plenty of room for the sticky pudding, which was as great as expected. I will probably return to the St. Francis but would not entertain guests there.",

We ordered flatbread and the goat cheese, both were amazing and both were offered on the happy hour menu. The goat cheese is insane, it's one of the tastiest things I've ever had.   For dinner I had the steak, which I never thought I would order but was in the mood. The steak was fantastic, the mashed potatoes were delicious and the veggies were colorful and cooked perfectly.

We came for brunch this visit and was welcomed by a friendly hostess, throughout the meal the staff does work moderately well together; sometimes there was a delay because it appears there was a shortage in servers and an abundance of other staff (roles unknown) standing about. Our server was very good! FOOD, we started out with the Baker's board which was a tray of breads and bread like pastries. Banana bread I was told was good I personally don't care for it so I didn't partake, a variety of other carb assortments including a delicious cinnamon cookie topped with caramel and my personal favorite the bread loaf as simple as it was it was delicious fresh bread with whipped butter there is nothing I hate more than warm bread with frozen butter you have to peel out of a wrapper so kudos for that! Fantastic! As a splurge my friend and I ordered eggs Benedict, avocado for me and salmon for him. Which came with fingerling potatoes. Let me speak to mine first, visually stunning a conservative amount of hollandaise (which I appreciate) there is nothing worse than drowning your meal in an unnecessary amount of heart clogging sauce. The egg cooked perfectly; However it wasn't hot...at all, I am not one to send anything back unless it was egregious and temperature wise this was definitely on the fence of \"do I or don't I\" I compared notes with my friend who not only was his not warm but his salmon was cold adding to the problem. If I ordered bagel lox and cream cheese I expect that the salmon wouldn't be hot but on eggs Benedict? Fingerling potatoes were very good crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, very salty but good.  Probably just this visit and our food probably just sat a little too long for whatever reason.",

The Host at the front sat me down at a booth behind the waiter/waitress station, so I asked to move to the next booth over. He grabbed the menus and dropped them on the next booth and walked away. Here's what really pissed me off.....moments later the same Host sat down an older couple behind me and asked them if the location was ok and then proceeded to tell them about happy hour, the cocktails, mentioned to them he included dinner menus and dinner starts at 5pm. Host also told them their server would be right with them and to enjoy their dinner. That's how every customer walking through that restaurant door should be treated, one would think right! However this is NOT how I was treated! Menus were dropped on the table (which were only happy hour menus even after I told him we had a reservation for 2 for a booth for dinner at 5pm). That's all I got! He did not mention happy hour, no mention of cocktails, no dinner menus were given to us, not even a have a nice dinner... nothing!! I'm glad my husband went to use the restroom before I got sat down because everyone in the restaurant would of heard how we were treated. When my husband returned to the table I told him I'm not giving this restaurant any money after the way I was treated, we walked out! Thank you for treating me like crap on my 21st anniversary, we ended up at a classier restaurant down the road from you, and they are treating us very well, the way we should be treated at a restaurant.",

When I finally checked it out, I went on a Saturday night around 8:30 pm. Complimentary valet was easy (make sure you're still tipping your valet drivers!), and we were seated right away.   By this time, the restaurant wasn't crowded at all. We were seated in the back patio area. It's a cute little place with lots of lights.... except it took about 15 mins for someone to come to us to just take our drink orders. Actually, nobody ever came - I had to get one of the servers' attention. Once I told her we'd been sitting there for 15 mins, she was apologetic so I became less hangry at this point. Food came and it was alright. After sharing my experience with the waitress, she gave us a dessert on the house for the wait, which I appreciated.  I haven't gone back to St. Francis since this first encounter, but I'd be willing to try it again for brunch or sometime during the day.",

Seriously there were four tables in the restaurant and they served pre cooked cold food!  The mimosa was mostly OJ and cost $8.  Most brunch places (decent, busy ones anyway) offer discounts on brunch cocktails.  Any of these issues alone would not be reason to come back, but the entire experience was bad.  There's a reason why there was an empty parking lot and restaurant when most others have a wait.  Someone has clearly given up on this place.  It's a shame because it used to be so great.",

The environment is unlike any eating establishment in the State.  You will not be disappointed!",

Asked the waitress to tone it down and she came back and said the entire system was on one master control and it could not be done. Someone said the restaurant had been sold to new owners. The great food we have always had the was just ok",

Since the brunch was so good, I definitely plan to return to St. Francis in the future to try out their dinner.",

    "text": "It makes me so sad to post this updated review..St. Francis, what has happened to you?? We have been regulars at St Francis for a long time, so it is so sad to see this gem of a restaurant go so far downhill with service and quality. We ate dinner here twice in the last week, one of the dinners was on a Sunday night-the restaurant was empty! It was depressing! Even though the restaurant was empty it took a while for us to be greeted by a server. We ordered our food, but we were told they were out of chicken for our dish, which was super weird and annoying for a Sunday evening..especially in an empty restaurant. Also, my husband ordered a coffee at the end of our meal..the coffee was cold..he could stick his finger in it (despite the server saying that she just brewed it) Unfortunately, we were not the only patrons experiencing the current sad state of this once amazing restaurant. We  were next to a table that had a family who ordered steak and wanted to have mashed potatoes..they were out of those too. Then there was another table that had a group of five that were there to celebrate a birthday, but after they ordered drinks they actually got up to hand the server a credit card--they must have sensed that this restaurant just isn't what it used to be. Another thing that we noticed is that all of the servers that we knew and loved had left..apparently the changing of management has been really rough on St Francis. We sincerely hope that it turns around and that St Francis will once again be the amazing restaurant that we once knew.",

Turns out their food is delicious and their staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. I had the perfect desert cocktail, the Santa Rosa, with vodka, St. Germain, pink grapefruit, and basil. I loved the Moroccan meatballs and the fingerling potatoes. I sat at the bar after the event. Evan was bartending, and he was fabulous. Great conversation as I enjoyed a Deschutes Fresh Squeezed and finished my evening with their wood-fired winter squash. This is a place to go if you're looking for quality ingredients prepared in a wood-fired oven with fine-dining service. This is not the place to go if you're looking for fast and cheap food. The architecture is interesting and fun - a remodeled old bank. There is also outdoor seating, which is perfect this time of year.",

We started with the Bakers Board - delicious array of pasties and bread to start us off right. Fresh and full of flavor.  Their fresh squeezed lemonade is the perfect blend of tart and sweet. Gives the full flavor of lemon!   For our meals we had the tomato baked eggs with fingerling potatoes and toast served up in ahoy skillet - scrumptious. The quiche, a standard, but made with just an extra touch of love you can taste! And, the chile burger with a fresh-made bun that just melts into so much excitement in your mouth! Makes me almost wish I lived in this state!   I will be back and bring friends on my next trip. Simply delicious!",

I came here last year for my 50th birthday, and they screwed up just about everything possible.  They ended up giving us free desserts and taking a couple appetizers off the bill to compensate.  I decided to give it another go for my birthday this year.  I ordered the burger.  I asked for it to be done medium.  It came well done and the bun was burnt, so I didn't eat most of the bun.  I upgraded my french fries to the fingerling potatoes.  They brought them with ketchup, but I remembered having them with lemon aioli.  I asked for the aioli, and they brought out mayonaisse.  I questioned them about this, and they assured me that it was the lemon aioli.  This is not the aioli I remember.  I used to be very lemony and creamy, and this might as well have been Hellman's mayonaisse.  Additionally, I remember the fingerling potatoes being \"smashed\" and covered with loads of fresh herbs and parmesan, and these were just \"meh\".  My daughter is a big fan of their goat cheese dip and she ordered it.  This time is was served with an excessive amount of tomato sauce, so the dip was way thinner than it normally is.  Aside from the mediocre food, they were clearly understaffed.  I didn't even bother complaining about the food, because I felt bad for the waitstaff.  I just wanted to go home.  This will be my last visit to St. Francis.  I am done thinking that the mediocre food was just a fluke and that it will be better next time.  Clearly, the chef/owners are not paying the same attention that they used to.",

Thank you, St. Francis, for creating a unique space where we could brunch, enjoy live jazz, and make our 3 and 1 year old feel welcome so we didn't have to find a sitter!  On to the food: eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and cream cheese was heavenly--perfectly poached and well balanced! My husband really enjoyed the pig dip with bacon onion marmalade. The kid's skillet choc chip pancake was literally a pan-CAKE and was big enough for all four of us to have some and bring some home. My son had the kids burger and fries, also a cut above a typical kids meal.  Wonderful. Highly recommend.",

However, the lines are always very only and the seating inside is one of the worst setups. It is cramped and uncomfortable. You are so close to the people next to you that it is awkward. So, so much constant awkward eye contact has been made here haha. I go on about the service and ambiance of places all the time in reviews because I think it is a big part of the dinning out equation. So if I go somewhere and don't like sitting in the restaurant I feel like I need to mention it. Here some of the food is very tasty but the experience is brought down the interior.

Which is surprising seeing as they label their menu throughly. Wouldn't take much to keep some boxed crackers on hand. Decided to do the mussels, which overall were not appealing and borderline cold. We are all fans of coconut milk and that style of food, but it just didn't go well together. 3/6 of us ordered the rice bowls which although a very large portion were absolutely dry, totally unseasoned ( zero ), and no sauce? It was basically black rice al dente, plain steamed vegetables and slightly seasoned chicken. We were all taken aback and asked if there was supposed to he a sauce to which the waiter responded \" i can get you som\", and brought out about a tablespoon in a cup per person, when it really needed a half cup full for the whole big portion. The meatballs were just OK, menu didn't describe meat blend, but were gamey, and again a huge portion of 6 in a skillet drowning in a red sauce. Menu description included a pasta noodle which must have been microscopic amomgst the sauce. The pork was just OK as well. Again,huge portion served over mashed potatoes with a red sauce. Menu said paprika based this was way off.. more like smoked tomatoes? Just didn't go well and overall underseasoned and blah. Quaint and nice atmosphere. Wouldn't go again for dinner maybe just brunch.",

    "text": "I was very excited to have a lunchy brunch at St. Francis this past Saturday. I was impressed by the environment and decor, but once I was served a rather average $9 Bloody Mary, the experience began to degrade.  I ordered the highly hyped Chile Burger. It's touted to be the best burger in the state. I beg to differ. It wasn't terrible, however it just wasn't all that exquisite.. The beef was kinda squishy and flavorless, and the spicy factor overpowered the flavors. This may just be a problem with my gut, but I began feeling kinda sick as I was eating it, and then spent the entire rest of the day experiencing horrific gut trauma. That's not why I'm giving St. Francis a 1 star review, though. The reason for the 1 star review is because my boyfriend and I experienced a bad case of waitress neglect. She probably spent a total of 2 minutes at our table. When the check arrived we were ready to pay immediately, and after waiting over 15 minutes, we took the check downstairs, and had to pay that way. She chirped out some sort of insincere apology, and I gave her a dirty look. The restaurant wasn't super busy, and we were the only party left upstairs at that point. This is inexcusable.",

Red chile peppers added quite a kick.",

This time of year, with open air, and hip vibe...little slice of heaven. I think the nice female bartender forgot to put my order in, as waiting for food was way tooo long, greater than 45 minutes.. Quality over all was really good, and I would have been less irritated if I wasn't dining solo. Pumpkin Soup excellent, as was romaine/ bacon salad. Beran  Zin , was good, though it never ceases to amaze me that Arizona eateries do not chill their reds. When it's 80-90 degrees out side, and you have open air dining, wine placed on shelves is not served at desirable temp. Postino does the same thing. Having said all that , I would return gladly, as the good things were really good.",

I love the fact that they have a bakery inside and make the most perfect pillowy bread that comes with jam and whipped butter for only $4. Bloody Mary's are always on point and their Benedict is just right! I have also tried the Egg Sandwich from the brunch menu and I can honestly say that I would not have a problem eating that every morning for the rest of my life.

    "text": "I love their food, however they get stricter with the baguette every time I go there. Why is so difficult to get a piece of baguette in this place??? Any idea??? And it is more frustrating the fact that I remarked please bring some extra baguette with my dish(since there was no bread at the time drinks were ordered) and my dish comes with JUST ONE slice of their famous baguette. When I asked the server for the extra bread, she replied \"this dish doesn't originally come with bread\". Thus, I was lucky that they delivered the dish with just ONE piece. Overall, interesting customer service approach!!!!!  I'm asking for 2-3 slices of bread, not for a free filet mignon or something like that.  I give them  two stars this time because of the above, hope the bread issue gets resolved soon. Going back on Thursday to see if they read reviews!!!!!",

    "text": "10/19/10 and 01/02/11  Took Mom w/ me for her first visit to St. Francis (and my second!) for a late lunch around 1p.  The place was packed, and as usual, very noisy.  Thought perhaps I'd finally get a chance to see how the seating was upstairs, but we were seated on the main floor.  Even though we were seated right away, it took more than 10 minutes before our server finally greeted us.  Even though I knew what I'd order for us both, I let Mom look over the limited menu-- for once, the lengthy downtime worked to our advantage!  She almost went for the lunch combo (soup, salad, and half of the Del Real sandwich), but in the end, we ordered the two items I already had my eye on before we'd left home (love to read menus online!).  We decided to share the French onion burger and the Red wine braised beef, and both came w/ a choice of fries or red quinoa salad, so we chose one of each.  The burger was a beauty!  On a substantial and gruyere-smothered patty lay greens, smoked bacon, and crispy shoestring onions, and these were all topped w/ a gorgeous bun!  We wouldn't hesitate to order this one again!  While the fries looked very promising, they were soggy, but Mom happily ate them.  I had the Red wine braised beef sandwich and the red quinoa salad to contend w/, so I didn't bother sending the fries back.  :)  We both loved the quinoa salad-- what a pleasant surprise!  Red quinoa is very good for you-- high in fiber AND protein.  A superfood, indeed!  The key to this salad was the citrus vinaigrette.  A must-try!  The braised beef was also very, very good!  That is, when we finally tried it w/ the horseradish sauce, which somehow was overlooked while Mom and I were divvying up the entrees.  Panini-style, between two slices of their Texas toast, buttered, and gruyere cheese.  DO NOT forget the horseradish sauce, as it just makes the flavors pop in your mouth.   --- When I'd learned that Dennis Rowland was in the house during Sunday brunch, I couldn't wait to go to SF on a rare Sunday off work!  Again, it was a packed house, and I finally was seated upstairs.  Oh my Lord, what a horrendous place to be!  While I could hear Rowland and his band play (it's actually less noisy up there- go figure), I couldn't see them, what w/ the rafters and the ceiling fans underneath, and the cork flooring made every footstep coming and going annoyances I couldn't wait to get rid off by finally leaving!  Thank goodness the two entrees I'd ordered made up for these... hiccups.  Liked the Iron skillet pancake (w/ dark chocolate chips and fresh raspberries), but thought the kitchen was a little light-handed on the chips-- please add more!  Also, I found the pancake was charred too much.  I thought it was bec. it was skillet-style, but I spied another table that received a perfectly un-charred one.  Really enjoyed the creme fraiche and fresh raspberries (please add more!), and the honey on the bottom of the pancake was delightful!  A great dish, really, even w/ the charred bits...  As for the house made biscuit-- well, one look at it and who could ever argue that it wouldn't taste grand??  Crazy-good fennel herb veggie gravy.  Yes, I said \"crazy-good.\"  There's a first time for everything!  :)    Two very good meals which will keep St. Francis on my (long) rotation list!  (BTW, I think I heard Mom sigh when I told her where I was having brunch while she was getting ready work... I really wished I could've taken her w/ me!)  p.s.  Not only did I not get a chance to SEE Rowland and his band play, but for the majority of my stay, the band actually took a break!  No doubt they were all enjoying some of the great-looking cinnamon rolls...  Next time, I'm going to wait for a table to open on the main floor.  That cork flooring upstairs has to go!",

I went here with a group of friends on a Wednesday night and was surprised to find out there was a 45 minute wait. The hostess was very friendly and said we could go the bar area or the area by the fire. While it is nice that we could hang out and have a drink I thought 45 minutes on a Wednesday was kind of a long time to wait for a table. Maybe I am just getting impatient as I get older...  I had the St Francis lemonade which was delicious and refreshing. For an appetizer we split the baked goat cheese. It was so good we ordered a second order. It was probably my favorite thing of the entire meal. For dinner I split the chicken flat bread with my sister. It was a good size portion and came with caramelized onions, chicken, fennel, and arugula. While it was tasty it didn't \"wow\" me. Two other of my friends both got the citrus salad and it looked pretty good and was something you wouldn't normally make for yourself at home - so maybe I will try this next time.  The service was friendly but I did feel as if our server was repeating things directly from the menu like a robot and he couldn't really make a good suggestion on what to try for food or wine. Overall, I think St. Francis is good place for groups or for a romantic dinner it just wasn't as spectacular as I thought it would be.",

The Za'atar chicken salad sandwich must have crack in it, or else there's no way to explain why I'm so hooked. The first time I had it, they were still making it as a chicken flatbread. Now they've incorporated it into a sandwich full of things that sound like they shouldn't go together but definitely do. It has a vinaigrette dressing instead of mayo, which makes it perfect for the sweltering Phoenix summer. And if you pair it with the quinoa salad, it's fantastic.   I'd like to order something else when I go, but no dice since I stumbled upon this combo. Maybe if I figure out the recipes, I'll finally be able to order and enjoy some of the other fantastic things they have to offer here. Until then, I'll just have to steal bites from other people's plates.",

Both were  great, with a ton of flavor. The freshly baked bread just added to the awesomeness of these dishes. (Hint- go buy some fresh loaves of bread to take home). Today we went for brunch which also was great. We both shared the Iron skillet pancake and biscuits and gravy. The pancake was very flavorful, with sweet and salty in every bite. The biscuits were flaky and buttery, but I was disappointed in the lack of sausage in the gravy. Not to mention that by the time I received the plate the gravy had gone cold.  Both were good dishes but I'd prefer the dinner menu instead.  The service for our dinner experience was great. We were sat upstairs not in the way of the heard of waiters downstairs right outside the kitchen which was where we were sat today for brunch. Other than that the food is good, and I would recommend this place to anyone.",

But it arrived, a rather sodden mass in a little bowl, with a couple chunks of cornbread... that was it.  If it had been delicious, that would have been fine, but oh my LORD was it salty!  Just ridiculous stupid-salty.  I tried to eat it, but ended up sending it back.... and I am NOT in the habit of sending things back.  I think maybe I did once about twenty years ago.  But it was inedible.  The waiter was very nice about it, and brought me a new choice (goat cheese flatbread, which was quite nice).  So, unless you are a big fan of salt, that's one dish you should probably cross off your list.",

We tried five of the appetizers, including some kind of fried potato fingers, a pizza thing with figs and prosciutto, a fresh salad, some green beans, a cucumber and tomato mix... I thought I was in heaven.  The fresh baked bread was great too.    Then came the entrees!  I had the roast chicken.  Some got the pork chop, and burger.  Everything was seasoned to perfection.  We also tried several of the desserts.  My favorite was some kind of caramel-date cake.  Sounds funny, but it was really really good.    The service was outstanding, attentive, genuine, not overbearing. Atmosphere is wonderful.  Although it's busy, I was never neglected.  I can't wait to go there again.",

    "text": "My husband and I tried St Francis for the first time yesterday afternoon.  We happened to get there during their happy hour menu - which is about half off of everything on the limited \"happy hour\" menu.  The ambiance was drew me in right away.  I love the brick walls and vine covered veranda.  I am a sucker for any Phoenix building that takes the time to create charm - major points for me - I tend to think Phx has a tendency to take the easy \"bland\" route when it comes to decorating most of the time. Not so here.  We started with the baked goat cheese which was fantastic.  We both had wine, also half off any glass.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which was by far the best chicken salad I've ever had.  I love that they created a nice twist by not smothering it in mayonnaise.  It was healthy and most importantly - delicious.  As a side I got the fingerling potatoes - good with a nice crust outside and sprinkled with Parmesan.    Husband ordered the burger and fries which was to die for.  The burger was juicy with bacon and an awesome buttermilk fried onion on top, Gruyere cheese, caramelized onion and brioche bun = amazing.  The fries were to die for.  We were planning on trying desert but were too full this time.  We will definitely be back - pleasantly surprised and happy to have found another gem in Phoenix!!",

It felt like she wanted us out of there and it was confirmed when at the end of our meal she dropped the bill  without even asking for the previously mentioned to go order we wanted to place. So much for that, our tab could of been higher! It sucks for her because we are like the best customers EVER, we tip great and are super easy, so very put off by this and said to everyone at the table, \"tip going down.\" Even though we still tip 20% which is a low tip for all of us.  But my foodie friends and I agreed that every time we have come here the service has lagged. Beautiful space though, which is why we always hope for success.  I am steadily unimpressed by the food. I have had dinner here and this was my first time having Sunday brunch. The best part of it was my amazing cinnamon roll.The orange juice was great, but it was a tiny glass and they put ice in it, WTF?! If I'm paying for fresh squeezed orange juice, on top of a small glass please leave out the ice!  I had the fried egg sandwich. Nice presentation, great tasting sandwich. Came with a side of potatoes, btw, I could live in a potato and eat my way out so I am sad, they look great but are tasteless, so tasteless I didn't even finish them. That's a first!  On top of everything, waited almost an hour for our food.   So, since I'm steadily unimpressed by this beautiful spot, I will go back, but only for drinks, they can't mess that up!",

We brought our 2 year old daughter and was sat in the front entrance area near the hostess. We didn't notice last time that there was a toy box that kids could take toys to play with so we were very happy to see it this time as our daughter was asleep last time we ate here and this time she was wide awake. So the toy box kept her very busy... it was placed neat the hostess so she had to walk through the entrance and it was a busy Saturday night so people and waiters had to go around her but all in all it was a great addition to keep her busy while we finish eating. The food was amazing again, the kids pizza was also delicious for it being a kids mean and not to mention it was FREE!!! For appetizers we got goat cheese spread fingerling potatoes and chili both great. For entrees we got cesar salad with romaine lettuce instead of kale, meatballs, flatbread pizza and pulled pork sandwich. All was AMAZING! We will definitely come back just wish it was closer to where we live so we can visit more often but it's worth the drive!",

This time we sat upstairs, which is set up like a loft, partially open to look over the first floor.  It was noticeably warmer than the first floor, but it wasn't uncomfortable.  An extra AC vent wouldn't hurt, though.  Nearly everything about the dinner was outstanding!  The server was attentive, but not annoying, the food was delicious, and the wine was a bit disappointing for the second time in a row.  Going back to the food, there were six of us that night.  We started with the baked goat cheese and warm baguette.  For our entrees, the six of us had the pork chop, pork chile verde, breakfast for dinner, white fish, salmon, and seafood cioppino.  Each of us raved about our own selection.  I don't think anyone had a single complaint.  Going back to the wine, which was fine, but not up to the standards of our meals.  My wife and I have tried two different bottles of red (a Rhone and a Malbec) during our different visits.  Typically, we enjoy the varietals we ordered very much, but not these two times.  We'll keep trying, because everything else about St. Francis is excellent (including the mid-century modern decor and ambiance), but we'll also keep our skepticism about the wine menu.",

(yes, the goat cheese appie, the only teaser on the menu other than a type of glorified French fry, was good).  The wine list was also small - 5 whites by the glass, a few more reds.  The (back bacon?) sandwhich I shared was very greasy & oily - ick.  We were invited to a Devoured Kick-Off event in which we were told we would be involved with 9 bartenders from different establishments who were going to make their concoctions, and that we would be able to try them all.  We were told to sit outside, even though we were early and there was available seating at the bar.  Well, unless you were seated directly at the tiny bar - about 5 or 6 seats on either side - there was no chance for any tastings, as anyone seated there got them all to themselves.  After a few pours, we indicated there seemed to be a situation and were told that no problem: continue sitting outside and they will soon be passing them around.  Didn't happen.  After about  1/2 way through, we realized we would not be partaking of any libations.  We indicated our displeasure, a refund was given, but we were definitely & hugely disappointed.  {We had about 3 other events we had been invited to on this same night, 1 being a free preview screening of a new movie, the other was a new restaurant much closer to home}, and needless to say we were bummed at missing out on better opportunities we had turned down.  Driving all the way here for what?  (Oh, any bar service was, of course, taking forever since it was full of bartenders for the event, so waiting for drinks in any way sucked all around).  I should point out that the manager very chivalrously proffered 2 signature Lemonade Cocktails upon overhearing our disappointing dilemma regarding the Martini Tastings.  I guess all was not lost, since Halo was across the street & I had been wanting to pop in there for a new custom jewelry piece for a piercing.    Overall, I seriously doubt I'd be back, considering how far from home this is, and all the other many alternates we passed on the way getting there.  But I would be ok with recommending it to someone who either lives nearby, driving past there anyhow, had something else to do in the area.  It is certainly an establishment which seems to be shiny and new in an area which is tired and drab.  Seems to be out of place where it is.  Would I go if it was located in say, Old Town?  maybe I'd give it 6 months before I thought about that. but maybe...",

I had first heard about it from Sunny B. and couldn't find it for a week after I read her review.  Duh!   It's right next to my bank!  When Tony suggested we go, I jumped right on that bandwagon! We had about a 15 minute wait.  The place looked packed, so 15 minutes was fine.  We sat outside and chatted for a bit.  We even talked about how cool it would be if we could sit upstairs.  Guess what?  WE WERE SEATED UPSTAIRS!!   Que milagro! Our waiter.  *sigh*  I shall hereforth refer to him as Dreamboat Brandon.  (spell check says \"hereforth\" isn't a word.  Is it???)  First of all, anyone who can deal with Tony and I together get major kudos.  We can be...raunchy brats when together.  Dreamboat Brandon rode the wave.  Great service on keeping our drinks filled and not hovering, even though the both of us would have loved that! I had the ahi sandwich, based on other reviews.  YUMMY!  It came with avocado and tomatoes and what I *think* was a horseradish mayo.  There was a little cup of homemade potato chips on the side.  Nice, thick (no, I'm not talking about Dreamboat Brandon!) steak of ahi on a thick Kasier-type roll.   The Arnold Palmer was made with mango iced tea, which was totally perfect with my meal. I love the decor!  Tony said I *had* to check out the bathroom.  Good thing I had to pee.  I couldn't figure out how to open the door to the WOMEN'S restroom and then it opened from inside...by a guy.  He said he couldn't wait.  I gave him the lecture on how WE have to wait in line at concerts and footballs games.  AND he had left the seat up.  Anyway, the bathroom was really funky.  There's even a safe in the wall, which I tried, while peeing, to open.  To no avail.   All of the staff was friendly and it was just a really cool atmosphere.  It's definitely a place CenPho needed.  I have never seen it empty, even on weeknights.  I am glad that it's so close to home.  I am also glad that they seem to be doing pretty well.  I would hate to see Dreamboat Brandon without a job.  Of course, I do need an assistant...",

    "text": "We have been St. Francis for dinner and my husband goes there for lunch. But a month ago, we learned about their BRUNCH with live jazz (with long time local favorite Dennis Rowland, a extraordinary pianist/vocalist Rachel Eckroth & fantastic Felix Sainz on bass). However, the live music is only the beginning to a great Sunday brunch.  The food is amazing and we've yet to have something we didn't absolutely love. I recommend the Roasted (4) Baked Eggs, braised beef, vegetables and croutons is my favorite while the smoked salmon poached egg, English muffin, hollandaise sauce is my husband's favorite. I must also say that their crispy potatoes are also very tasty.  Don't ask for the \"spicy' Bloody Mary, unless you can take the heat. I prefer their Sweet Mimosa.  Other food suggestions include the two eggs with bacon, the Summer Vegetable frittata and I see many people order the French Onion Burger. PS - Kid friendly menu too!",

    "text": "In a word... Meh.  Actually, I don't think that is even a word, but it should be.  I was moderately impressed, but not so much that I would return any time soon.  There are too many great restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale at which to spend my hard-earned dough.  Ok, well, actually it is someone else's hard earned dough as I date but you get the idea...  First the dislikes: Wine list:  Not a big selection.  Like one italian red and no merlot or zinfandel and I think that Phx is more sophisticated than that.  We  like a LITTLE variety...     The Menu:  I don't know about you but I like more than a few offerings for my appetizer and dinner.  I mean, you don't have to be the Cheesecake Factory but one soup, a potato thingie, a salad  and baked goat cheese just is not much of an offering.  Also, I don't eat meat and I am pretty healthy with what I eat, and the only healthy thing I saw on the menu I could eat was the salmon salad.  Just not a big selection period.     Service:  A mixed bag.  Great attentive waitress who got us our drinks as soon as we got there and was really nice.  However, the actual meals themselves were oddly served.  My companion got his pork chop and then we both sat there looking at each other as they never served mine. Thank God for my scintillating wit and fabulous conversational ability! However, being the gentleman that my companion is, he wouldn't eat without me having my meal and finally we told the server to put his back on the warming plate in the kitchen (EWWW!!) 'til mine was ready to be served.  Apparently, they burned my salmon and had to re-do?  Then 5 minutes later when we got our dinners, the companion again had to flag down a server to get salt and pepper on the table.  Now what is up with that?  What kind of restaurant makes you request salt and pepper?  Especially with pork chops?  Back home, mom's good old cooking meant that you salted and peppered the heck out of the pork chop.  Maybe this is different here but I have never had that happen... Dessert was their bread pudding which was highly recommended by the waitress and I guess it was good but I just have never been a big fan of that type of dessert.     Likes:  As I said above, really nice waitress and we met the owner.  One interesting thing about the womens' bathroom is that there is an actual safe in there on which they hang the TP from the turning circle.  Kinda cool and the owner told me that they found that there when they did the demoltion and it has still never been opened.  Just think, we could have Al Capone's Vault in there!  Welll, probably not but I told him it would be a great promotion to open it as a party theme...Anyhoo, as well, when we FINALLY got the meals they were excellent.  The salmon was cooked nicely with a great little lemon vinaigrette and the pork chop was to die for.  The goat cheese app by the way is FABULOUS.  Oh, and the after dinner coffee was tasty.  So that is it..good food, not a lot of options.. limited wine list and we would up at Rokerijj for after dinner drinks...  and then the evening wound up ... better!",

We had to wait about 25 minutes before getting seated but it was no problem because our server brought us drinks while we sat and enjoyed the live jazz music.   My friend and I started off by sharing a GIANT cinnamon roll topped with caramel sauce. SO GOOD. We destroyed the pastry in minutes, which left both of us wondering how we were going to eat our meals. Fortunately, we are both gluttons and were able to pull ourselves together for round 2. I had the Eggs Benedict and roasted potatoes and my friend ordered the Wood-Oven Baked Eggs. Both were delicious.  The only thing I didn't like was that the tables were very close together. At times it felt like we were dining with our neighbors. Overall I would highly recommend St Francis' brunch and I am eager to return again.",

    "text": "Overpriced mediocre food  I was told by my friends how cool this place was and how I should check it out soo bad... I normally have brunch at Barrio Cafe, or La Grande Orange, and I love both places.  We arrived at around 11:30 on this past Sunday to a packed restaurant.  Complimentary valet was great (I get to that in a bit though).  The wait was 20 - 25 minutes.  I couldn't believe how many crying children were in this place.   After 35 minutes we were seated, and I noticed how cramped the restaurant was set.  I ordered coffee and their Egg Benedict.  The coffee was the grossest coffee I have ever had; seriously, it was very gross instant coffee.  Definitely what I expected in a cool hip restaurant.  My Egg Benedicts were great, and I like them.  I ordered them with prosciutto, and avocado, and they were well made.  For lemonade, a coffee, Egg Benedict, and Biscuit and gravy the bill came to $48... really??? I do not mind paying to quality but this is really stretching it.  We paid the bill and left to grab my car.  They had my car parked right in the front as you enter, and the valet attendant complimented me on it.  I gave him my ticket, and he said \"would you like to pick it up yourself?\"  My response was \"do you want a tip?\", and then he proceeded to walk to the car and driving it over.  All and all, the place is cute, but it is way over-crowded.  Their food is decent but hey, most places have decent food.  Prices are not reasonable.  In the future I stick to Arcadia and Scottsdale for brunch the way I have always done it.  I really don't get the need of paying a premium to listen to crying babies, and receiving just Ok food.",

    "text": "This is the beginning of a beautiful relationship. I had the pleasure of visiting St. Francis with fellow Yelpita, Teresa F. We were searching for a place to eat after discovering that the Parlor was closed on Sundays. What a lucky find when we checked in on St. Francis!  I was immediately struck by the fantastic \"open air\" design of the restaurant. We were waited on by a very friendly, knowledgeable server who did not hesitate when asked about their offerings and daily specials.  We decided to start with the Baked goat cheese which came with tomato, walnut herb pesto and toasted. It was so tasty! It could easily fill up a person! I had to hold back on devouring the app so I could still have room for the main event!  For the main dish I chose the evening's fish special which was halibut with vegetables. I was so glad I went with the fish. It was so good. It was juicy and tender, with a flavorful pan seared crust. The vegetables that came with it weren't just an afterthought. In this case I had a green mixture that was fresh and complimented the fish perfectly. I was very impressed by my meal!  While St. Francis is a tad on the pricier end, it is affordable, accessible cuisine. I really look forward to my next visit. The food was fresh and flavorful. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I'd pray to that Saint!",

They need to have some sort of manager there at all times to make sure their employees do their jobs.  Which they are clearly not.  I hate to say it, but I'm done.

    "text": "I'm in like with this place. I should have been more adventurous. I sat at a bar overlooking the goings on in the kitchen which was fun. This place uses a huge brick oven to prepare a lot of the food which is very cool. Seeing this made me want to order their flat bread, which is a personal pizza. Actually you could share it. I got the meat one. It definitely had some heat to it with the zesty red sauce, pepperoni, sausage, pickled red peppers and mozzarella.  The taste of the bread and pizza to me were mediocre and acidic. Also I got a raw piece of sausage. Oh well, things happen. They offered me some of their buttermilk dressing for dipping, and actually that was the best part about the pizza. Pizza to me was bleh, add the ranch, and yum.   Last I got the chocolate cake. The description mentioned it having custard. What? Custard? Chocolate? Yes please. Unfortunately the cake was unremarkable, and it was just a greedy, light little drizzle of the custard sauce, and that didn't have much flavor. Not that I wanted to drink it or anything..well maybe.  The menu is amazing, and next time I will explore more! The service was awesome. The design was very modern, sleek, and open air with a bar. This place is definitely worth a try.",

We arrive about five minutes early. As we are waiting for our table to be \"cleaned off\" parties who come in after us are seated first. It took 20 minutes to be seated, 15 minutes after our reservation.  Our server takes about 10 minutes to come over. I'm not sure she remembered to put in our drink order right away because the drinks didn't get to our table for 20 minutes. People who were seated after us got drinks before us. Once we ordered and the food came out, no one really enjoyed their food. Personally, my food was cooked wrong and included things I asked to be removed.  Long waits. Bad service. Mediocre food (if cooked correctly).  No one from our party of four will be returning or recommending.",

This place looked up scale and was busy with the white collar professional crowd. Bar was filled but the place has lots of seating and since I was alone I chose to sit at the counter near the open kitchen. What a great choice. The chef gave me a sample cauliflower dish - I would not have ordered this normally because I am not that adventurous, but it was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUSZ I got their flat bread for dinner - also unbelievably good. Highly recommend this place, especially if you want to do happy hour with your attorney friends or significant other. Also, the kitchen is extremely well run. Clearly the chef (owner?) has thing under perfect control. Execution was clearly flawless. Highly recommended eat in Phoenix!",

The interior is very trendy yet comfortable attracting people of all ages. The menu is well thought out with lots of options but not overwhelming. We decided to start our breakfast by sharing a cinnamon roll. This cinnamon roll is probably one of if not the best I have ever had. The bread is soft with a firm exterior. The perfect amount of cinnamon is baked inside and the entire thing is coated with a caramel sauce. Absolutely amazing! For breakfast I had the mushroom quiche and my boyfriend had the eggs Benedict. Both were fantastic with the right amount of flavors and salt. The service was also excellent, very friendly and attentive. We will be returning many times to come.",

It was a fabulous meal.  We started with the pumpkin soup, which they split for us. I actually found my half more than adequate, I couldn't actually imagine eating what would have been the entire portion. It was quite good though (made with cream which makes anything good). We also ordered the baked goat cheese which is served with a marinara-type sauce for spooning on the accompanying bread and was very good.  For dinner I had Moroccan Meatballs, and my friend had pork chile verde which I sampled and was good. The meatballs were excellent, and in fact the only reason I didn't give the full 5 stars was that the \"pasta\" on the meatballs was pearl pasta in the sauce, which when cooked is tiny and really lost in the dish. In fact, I didn't even realize that it was in there because the plate simply appeared to be three large meatballs in red sauce and I finally identified what looked like small tapioca balls swimming in bottom of the plate. The only way to really eat the pasta is to eat gobs of sauce, which wasn't going to happen. I felt it would have been better accompanied by a different pasta or at least more pasta and less sauce. None of this detracted from the flavor though. I would give them 4.5 stars but Yelp doesn't do half stars)  Service was excellent, complimentary valet parking as well. We were seated upstairs which is a quieter part of the restaurant and it was very nice.",

We got the summer squash as an appetizer and that was delicious.  For dinner I decided on the Roasted Salmon \"Superfood\" dish, which was nothing short of spectacular.  Our server said it was her favorite dish on the menu and now I know why.  Once we were done with the entree's she let us know all of the desert options.  None of them sounded as good as the salmon dish, so I ordered another one and only ate about a 1/4 of it.  Which meant the next morning I got to eat it again with an over easy egg on top, and it may even have been better with the egg!  Cheers!--I will be back!",

I'm not so much a fan of the forced \"complimentary valet\" but the city of Phoenix is grooming me to expect such things if I want to eat in the area.    The restaurant is cute.  Menu is diverse and they have a great cocktail list.  The goat cheese appetizer is pretty fantastic if you like goat cheese.  The food is good, but not great.  I had the vegetable flatbread pizza and with a little more seasoning, it would have been delicious.  Our table shared the cheesecake in a jar as well as the stout cake - all were delicious (and I'm a tough customer when it comes to chocolate cake).    Our waitress was generally fantastic all evening.  She seemed a little short when there was a mix-up with the credit cards and amounts but was back to being cheery as soon as it was fixed.

We had about five different people wait on us, and we still aren't sure who our official waiter was.  The five that came did so sporadically and would forget and ask the same questions twice and then when the drinks came, they were adequate.  It was happy hour so that's good but the wait was quite long to receive them and then when asked if I was ready for another and I said yes, he came back again another fifteen minutes later and asked the same question.  Um, yes!  Rather than have a salad, or pay over $20 for an entree, I opted for the black rice dish. Or \"Forbidden Rice Bowl\" with supposedly 7 veggies, ginger, garlic and sweet and spicy dressing. The veggies were very al dente.  Asparagus and tomatoes being the shining stars of the dish.........altogether it was ok but not memorable.  For a drink I had the  Santa Rosa;  finlandia vodka, st. germain, pink grapefruit &basil.  It was good. Not the strongest drink I've had in Mid Town Happy Hour but it was good.  My friend tried the Mezcal Mule; sombra mezcal, gosling's ginger beer, cucumber, agave &passion fruit........and sent it back as unbearable.  She opted instead for a glass of   Walnut Block Sauvignon Blanc, which she said was divine and a Market Vegetable Flatbread which she said was \"okay.\"  It took a while to get someone to take our money and overall just not that impressed.  My friend did say it is usually packed during happy hour with much noise due to the hard surfaces everywhere......but this Thursday night it was quite dead which did not help to explain the lack of customer service.  There are just way too many better places to go than to spend $20 on a broiled chicken dinner or bowl of rice.  Sorry.",

There's nothing bad about the place but it was just mediocre and if we hadn't paid $5 each for drinks and apps, I probably would have been ticked off but for the price- I guess it's ok. We had the fingerling potatoes, they were cooked well but tasteless; rather like eating a fried cotton t-shirt. The dip that came with the order didn't help one bit. We also had the flatbread- also well cooked, possibly a bit too black on the bottom but also flavorless. Not bland but completely missing in flavor. I feel a bit bad- clearly there's some skill with the kitchen, but their recipes need some help. Bar staff were ok, friendly but not terribly attentive but they were doing drinks and also handling a lot of customers who were dining at the bar to avoid the dining room wait.",

The deal was that it had to be some place neither of us had been before. What better way to handle such a daunting responsibility than to visit the web page of my favorite dining show, \"Check Please Arizona\". A GREAT show on KAET... Something you really should check out. Anyway, I stumbled upon St. Francis on their list of reviewed places and decided to give it a go.  So, keeping Fork in the dark as to our dining location, we ventured out with our sometime dining partner and Fork's husband... \"Spoon.\"  Arriving at St Francis, we were greeted by a complimentary valet service. Spoon commented on the service which is a nice add given that their parking appears to be a bit limited. We ventured in the restaurant and took in the decor. There is one table just as you enter that is pretty cool. Surrounded by floor to ceiling glass, it gives you the feeling of sitting outside but you are comfortably inside. Appreciated on this 115* day! The decor is very nice. You get a nice view of the wood fired oven as you enter with loaves of fresh baked bread. Both things the \"Saint\" is known for. We were promptly seated which may have been because I was able to make reservations through St. Francis' website. A very, very nice touch as the Saint is very popular so it is nice to know you are guaranteed a seat!  Once seated, the first thing we all commented on was the noise. It was very, very loud. It was challenging having discussions with individuals across the table. Spoon commented that the design of the restaurant; cement floors, metal tabletops, brick walls, etc....don't do much to buffer the noise. One could say that the noise adds to the energy and vibrancy of the place. As it turns out, shortly after a large party of 8, which included several young diners left, the noise level dropped to a much more enjoyable decibel. Upon leaving, I noticed that there was a second level to the restaurant. I ventured upstairs and found a very nice, bright dining area. I would image that the second floor might be a bit quieter as the sound has some place to go. Give it a try if the noise level might bother you.  On to the food. For drinks, Spoon asked for a Bellini and Fork and I both had the St. Francis Bloody Mary's. I asked that mine be spicy (it was) and had a salted rim (no problem). All of us commented on how well the cocktails were prepared.  Since we were there for brunch, we looked over the menu for an appropriate \"appetizer\". We landed on The Baker's Board... And boy, are we glad we did. The board had a couple very delightful muffins, a chocolate scone, their famous bread, two types of butter and a cute little jar of strawberry jam.  All of \"the utensils\" loved making our way around the board and it turned out to be plenty for the three diners. Our server was more than patient with us, never once pressuring us to place our brunch order. She dutifully checked in on us to take additional drink orders and refill waters.  For our main, Fork had the Tomato Baked Eggs (tomato sauce, crispy potato fingerlings, cheese blend, herbs and toast), Spoon had the Vegetable Flatbread (spinach, roasted peppers, charred onions, spaghetti squash, avocado and lemon) and I enjoyed their Fried Egg Sandwich (A fried egg, mozzarella, peppers, bacon, arugula and chipotle aioli).  All of the mains arrived well plated and ready for us to enjoy. My Fried Egg Sandwich came with my choice of fries or a salad. Having selected the fries, Fork could not wait to ask to try them...and even asked for a particular fry!  The girl is very picky.  We both agreed that the fries were quite tasty.  Fork commented on how well her main was prepared. Both Fork and Spoon's portions were quite large...enough to share, which they did, each trying the other's entree...commenting on how good it was (Spoon, \"Mmmmm... That tomato sauce has a little spice to it.\") and then switching back!    The Server checked back to see if we wanted any desert. (HA!  Good one.) No doubt the desert would have been AMAZING, but who had room? Spoon did comment that he is going to return to try their  Iron Skillet Pancake (olive oil, dark chocolate, caramel apples, maple syrup and whipped cream). Got to admit, it does sound quite tasty.  St. Francis is a gem.  Their food is wonderful. Thoughtfully created, prepared and plated.  Their service is attentive and professional. The decor is comfortable and enjoyable. All totally justifying my 5 star rating. I encourage you to try St. Francis and take advantage of the Open Table reservation system on their website as the place is popular and justifiably so. Don't be the only person not having tried \"The Saint.\" You won't be sorry, and you will be back!  - Knife  (Written by Knife of Knife N Fork.

    "text": "This place was a total disappointment! A group of 10 of us went here for my birthday, the menu looked good and we were excited to try something new. We ordered quite a variety of things and no one really enjoyed any of it unfortunately. For apps we had the fried okra (I don't like okra to begin with so can't comment personally), the goat cheese and the potatoes. The goat geese app was pretty good, everything else was eh. For dinner I personally tried the risotto (had a very odd flavor) and the forbidden rice bowl (bland). Scallops were decent but nothing to write home about. I got the bread pudding for dessert - it was not like any bread pudding I've ever had before (and I don't mean that in a good way!). It tasted like slightly dried out spice cake sitting in a puddle of melted ice cream. My husband said even his cocktail was mediocre. All in all, \"mediocre\" sums up our experience and I personally, I would find somewhere else to eat dinner! There are too many other good restaurants to choose from!",

My food came out not that hot.  Meat was a little tough.  And the mashed potatoes were cold  My date's food was hot but not cooked to her specification.  Service was very slow.  Did not get our food out for almost 30 minutes.  First visit and probably my last.  Would not recommend this place.  Much better choices for the money.",

    "text": "Normally, I don't bother with reviews even with poor service because I can get by with very little but this experience was all around unpleasant. When we arrived we were told 15 minutes to be sat. No biggie! Finally sat at 25 minutes, we weren't upset at that point, just excited to be sitting on the patio. The service from there on was TERRIBLE. The waitress didn't tell us her name or I would be mentioning it here. We sat far too long waiting for water, our food, and no quality check whatsoever. When we needed a box, another server came through the door and I asked him if he could bring us one, some water and the check because we hadn't seen our waitress in awhile. He responded that she was with another big party and was busy. I understand when people get busy in the service industry and we are easy-breezy in understanding that BUT we were totally ignored our entire experience and their was no urgency in providing good customer service. The restaurant was not busy AT ALL (I've seen higher volume restaurants perform miracles with excellent customer service!) but we were simply not important enough to be served. No apologies, no acknowledgement to our dissatisfaction, just excuses. I will not be visiting this place again, though we did enjoy the meal. There are other places to get better food with better service. Thank you, No thank you.",

    "text": "I went to St. Francis last night with two friends and was completely blown away.  The drinks were amazing (I had the peartini - literally tasted like I bit into a pear, my friends had the almond margarita - almost as delicious).    We opted to skip the appetizers since we all have sweet tooths.  I had the pot roast which was such a (great) departure from my mother's version.  The beef fell apart with the fork and had a fantastic flavor to it.  A little on the sweet side but not overpowering at all.  The veggies and polenta were great sides to this dish.  My friends had the hanger steak which was cooked perfectly and the french onion burger where the cheese just made the burger oh-so-good.  All three of us finished our entire plates even though we swore we were taking to-go boxes.  The portions were just right.  For dessert we could not decide which sounded the best so we went with all three!  Clearly we should have worn our stretch waist pants.  The bananas foster was not your usual syrupy goop, it was baked in a skillet and had more of a bread pudding texture than just banana mush (I usually am not a fan of the dessert but this was delicious).  The St. Francis Turtle was a round-wonder of a brownie.  The edges were covered in nuts, the chocolate fudge and caramel mousse on top were to die for.  Saving the best for last, the sticky toffee pudding.  I can only say it was like having a taste of heaven in every bite.    I would definitely go back... and have all three desserts again.",

Clientele and staff including the valet all seemed relaxed. The tomato soup was awesome and our other starter was the tomatoes/ mozzarella (aka. Caprese) and we enjoyed that as well. I had the scallops for dinner and I'm not a big scallop guy but they were awesome. My fiance said they looked big and juicy as well as delicious but she did not try a bite. Lol She had the salmon which she said was very good and I agreed cause I finished her plate. She said the quinoa was a little to sweet for her but I had no problem with it. Service was pretty good...non intrusive and didn't let our glasses get empty. We will be back.",

    "text": "I haven't been to St. Francis in a while now, but I was just thinking about how much I am craving it, and decided I needed to show it some love until I can make it back.  I've been to St. Francis three times, in three different contexts. The first time was during happy hour for a little girl time. We shared the goat cheese appetizer, which was DELIGHTFUL. None of us could get enough of it. The server brought us more bread so we could shovel more of it into our maws. One of my companions selected a glass of wine from their impressive menu, and I had the St. Francis Lemonade, which wasn't special, but I was hyperventilating too much over the goat cheese to care. As a special note, we were on the patio, as we had some business to discuss, and were the only ones out there, but our server was still attentive and we never wanted for a thing.  The second time, I went with my boyfriend later, after the dinner rush on a weekend. It was my boyfriend's first time and my first time having an entree. I can't remember what I had, but I know it had brussel sprouts in it and they were perfect. This time I went for the almond margarita - and then another one. The boyfriend was also impressed. We ate in the dining room and this time I had the opportunity to fall in love with the interior. On the exterior, St. Francis is one of those places you drive by and think, \"Wow, I think everyone there is having fun. I want to go to there.\" And then when you're inside, it only gets better. It's modern and open and you feel about 10 times cooler just for sitting there. Also, I had a Catcher in the Rye shirt on, and the server complimented it. So, that's a huge win, to me.   The last time I went, I went with my parents, during the dinner rush. We sat at the bar until our table was ready. The bartender was great and got us refills as soon as the ice was visible over the drink line. I would say the bar is one of the main attractions to St. Francis. It's at the front of the restaurant and it halfway open to the outside. Once we were seated, we were amazed that as for as crowded as the restaurant was, we could still hear each other. My parents liked the atmosphere, but as an older couple from the midwest, were not too satisfied with the menu. My dad did enjoy his pot roast, but I think he wished for more comfort food. He also loved his dark and stormy, and in fact had more rounds than I had ever witnessed him consume at one dinner.  Yelp says that this place is not good for kids, which to me, is a selling point. When I'm out to dinner, I don't want to hear kids screaming or carrying on. And in fact, I don't think I've ever seen a kid there. However, there is a kid's menu and apparently kids eat free, so if you are planning a night out, be aware that you run the risk. The sound-level is fine, but I don't think I 'd want to share that space with someone pitching a hissy.  People have described this as a hipster place, but honestly, I have seen more young couples and young professionals than anything else.  I would say it appeals to the \"young and cool\" crowd, not necessarily the \"young and cool before cool was cool\" crowd.   In short, great place for a date at probably any time of day, good happy hour, and fantastic drinks as a whole. Go here and you will increase your cool points.",

Service was attentive on the first visit, the server had personality, and each of our dishes was great.  We were only seated at a table & did not experience the bar, but the drinks we ordered (almond margarita and dark & stormy) were very good.  During our second visit, our service was lackluster. We waited at the bar until our reservation time and the bartender did not greet us as we waited. It took 10 minutes before he looked our way and gave us menus.  He wasn't very busy as we waited so that was strange. We were then seated and that service was slow. The server was pleasant but it took forever for her to take our orders, the water service was non-existent, and we would have had dessert but instead she brought a check.  The food was okay; nothing spectacular.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. It has a great vibe, cool decor, nice patio, but for me the service and food are the draw and this restaurant is inconsistent.",

The night we dined there, they ran out of flatbread which ruled out a good portion of the menu (minus one star).  Our waitress was very young and awkward/nervous which made the whole experience slightly off (there goes another star).  It's a good thing the fried fingerling potatoes were to die for and the pork chile verde was spicy and divine-- that means I'll make another trip back to give it another try.",

    "text": "Had a wonderful time at St. Francis last night.  A friend in town and did a re-do of the visit we had in April and the second time around was very enjoyable.  Staff and service were very good.  Taylor did a great job!  A couple of others assisted him when he was busy.  He was knowledgeable about the food and beverages and sometimes it stuns me to realize how much wait-staff have to keep filed in their brains to fill us all in when we go to eat.    The drinks at St. Francis are unique and delicious.  Hubby had the Bisbee - a tamarind syrup and vodka beverage that he enjoyed all evening.  Friend had a glass of red wine and I opted for the Santa Rosa with the grapefruit juice, vodka, and muddled basil.  Delicious concoctions...compliments to the bar!  Our food was overall very good!  Clear winners included the baked goat cheese appetizer - hot and creamy with a little tomato tang and finished with basil.  The stuffed peppers were outstanding - the pepper, the stuffing, and the sauce were all great on their own, but together they were delicious - I could eat them for breakfast!  The cheesy polenta was good...my memory of the last visit was that it was better then but I couldn't put my finger on \"why\" that was - but I have to say it was still a very good and wonderfully creamy dish and I'd order it again in a heartbeat.  We shared our entree's and by far the tops we had were the meatballs.  At first the sauce was sizzlingly spicy but the meatball was scrumptious and toned down the sauce; combined they were probably the dish I liked best all night.  I had a seared salmon served with a quinoa salad under the fish.  Fish had just the slightest fishy taste - but it was cooked to perfection with a nice golden crunchy outside and moist flesh inside.  Hubby had the Forbidden Rice dish and it was the weak link; not a lot of flavor and the black rice, although tasty, was just a little under-cooked.  There were some timing issues; food came out too fast - we didn't have time to finish one course in a relaxed way before the next one arrived and we wound up with a table overflowing with dishes of partially eaten food while the new ones were arriving.  Now granted...we ate it all anyway, but that did \"rush\" it a bit.  We saw that at other tables too...so the kitchen maybe needs to tweak that a bit with the staff.  We didn't have it...but the table next to us ordered the pork chop and I don't think I've EVER seen a thicker one!  Had to be close to 3\" thick and full as we were, we would have loved a nibble of the chop as he was cutting it.  It looked very good.  Overall...a great night...glad we went back!!!",

    "text": "While I do admit that the green chile with cornbread was pretty great. I have had a beet salad here that was also very good and a variety of other menu items and they are very consistent with their quality. If the review was strictly on food quality and preparation It would be an easy 4 stars, but when reviewing a restaurant one can't leave out some of the obvious frustrations. I love open air venues (especially this time of year), but if there is a fly infestation then it's probably best to close the doors and windows, get the exterminator out and wait until the right time to open everything back up. When I spend 1/4 of my time swatting flies away from my food I find that very frustrating.  As with many other Central Phoenix corridor venues the parking is miserable as well it is a forced valet which if you happen to come with no cash on hand can leave you in a very uncomfortable and embarrassing situation.  I know the fly problem is only temporary, so I will be back again...And next time I will make sure I have some cash on me for the valet.",

I love the layout & the overall feel of the place. There was a lot of natural light and the music was awesome.  St. Francis has an awesome drink menu...I had the Pineapple Rum Mojito (amaze balls and pretty self-explanatory) and the Peartini ( Grey Goose Pear, St. Germain & lime I believe; kick in the mouth but definitely not a bad thing! Better to be strong than weak.).   My girlfriend & I had the baked goat cheese which was yummy...different but a good start to lunch. The Turkey & Avocado sandwich was what I had for lunch based on the server's recommendation and while the sandwich itself was tasty, the fries were mostly soggy...not crisp at all really. I'm a pretty big fan of fries and the few I did manage to eat were good but unfortunately, most of them weren't...which is basically my only \"meh\" moment during lunch.  Our service was ok; not the best...not the worst.  I'll definitely be back for dinner to check out the ambiance and try a few different things! Overall success.",

The okay: Mushroom Flatbread and Forbidden Rice Veggie Dish were fine but not great.   The bad: Pumpkin soup and Baguette appetizer were super disappointing.  Wish the food at St Francis would catch up to its surroundings",

However, what put a damper on the whole experience was the service. We waited for 20 min for our check after asking for it and our bill was incorrect.  I was warned about SLOWWWWWWWW service in AZ. and now I have lived it.",

    "text": "I stumbled across St. Francis by way of Check Please a PBS show any foodie should not miss.  Well let me say I went to Check Please website and was looking for a great place to eat for our anniversary.  Check Please gives you not only a review but you can watch a short snipit about the restaurant and see some of the food.  So the tipping point for me was the Pork Chop.  Now I am not a huge Pork Chop fan personally however my husband is always on the hunt for the melt in your mouth kind and I think we have a winner winner chicken dinner here.. The atmosphere was relaxed, several unique eating places within the restaurant.  Service was impeccable.  But the portions are fairly large so we did split the Pork Chop and added salads and the Goat Cheese appetizer.  So good, you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Okay so I'm a little late to the game here. But in this case, better late than never because St. Francis was awesome!  The boyfriend and I headed to St. Francis for breakfast/brunch on Sunday. We thought if we went later we'd miss the crowd. We were wrong. We got there close to 11AM and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. We ended up waiting only about 20 or so because we were willing to sit outside.  We decided to split a couple things so we ordered the eggs benedict with salmon and the baked pancake. The eggs benedict was delicious. I highly recommend the salmon. It wasn't overly fishy, it was a great combination with the eggs and hollandaise sauce. I was a little bummed that it didn't come with anything - no potatoes or fruit - would have been nice.  The pancake was SO rich. A good thing to share. It's like a pancake/cupcake/bread thing more than a straight up pancake. They fill it with chocolate and top it with berries and cream. Could have used a little more cream on top but overall it was really, really good. Don't let the olive oil weird you out - it works.  We were very happy with our food and the atmosphere. There was a live band with added a nice touch to the morning dining. I would definitely go back for breakfast and would love to try their dinner sometime.",
