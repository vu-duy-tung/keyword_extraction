It was $16!!!. I did not custom build my pizzas, I selected two from pies which were premade on the rack. They charged me .75 cents per topping on top of the price for the cheese slice!! I chose a meat lovers, I didn't ask for them to make me a meat lovers, I took what was already baked on the shelf. They charged me for 7 ingredients at 75 cents per ingredient. Needless to say I will never go back there again unless all I want is cheese pizza as I s hold not have to refinance my home to eat.",

I really enjoyed the meal part of our \"meal\" but otherwise the experience was sub par. Most of our group kind of lost their appetites when people started throwing chairs, tearing off each other's shirts and punching one another. Seeing people walking around afterward with gashed faces and bruised bodies didn't help either. I know it's hip to have an ambiance like second rate tattoo parlor that will give its customers hepatitis but that doesn't mean you need to attract the same clientele. You're a pizza place, stick to what you're good at.  The service was also agonizingly slow, albeit not as slow as the Tempe police department's response to the various 911 calls. It's cool guys, take your time, it's not like the town is flooded with tourist around New Years and this might give the city a bad reputation.",

    "text": "Went here on a Friday night, and it was busy. Not a big deal, it's Mill Ave on a Friday night. Everywhere is busy. It's a college town. My friends and I sat down, and waited 15 minutes for service. The only reason the server finally came over, is because we got another employee to bring someone over. I had gone up to the bar and asked if I could order food there, and was told no. Only for takeout. Well, that guy lied to me because I saw several people going up there and getting pizza slices and bringing them back to their tables.   I ordered two beers since they were having specials, and was asked for my ID again even though I had on a wristband they made me get. Okay, fine. Then when I go back to get two more beers, I'm told I can only get one at a time. I said I just got two, and they try to tell me the liquor law states that I can only get one at a time. ANOTHER LIE. Seriously. You really expect every single person in the party to go up separately to get drinks when it's that busy? I just wanted two beers. I've been to bars all over Phoenix and nobody else has ever pulled that crap.   Then we finally get to order, and it takes OVER AN HOUR for us to get some pizza slices. We were pissed. Then, on top of the wait time, the pizza was HORRIBLE. I've eaten at so many different pizza places in the Valley, and I swear to god even Pizza Hut has better pizza than this place. You can't even use being busy as an excuse for the pizza slices taking so long. All we had was cheese, and I have been to Venezia's Pizzeria in Tempe hundreds of times, and even on a super busy Friday night, I have never waited more than 10 minutes for my order when dining in. No excuses.   Servers/bartenders were rude, food was terrible, and the atmosphere is pretty douche-y/pretentious. I will never waste my money here ever again. Your business won't last long if you keep this crap up. You need servers that know how to handle several tables at once and can keep things organized. Seriously... I know this wasn't your first Friday night on Mill Ave. I have no idea how you don't have your crap together.",

Yes thats a big statement, go put something in your mouth that I can't say on here if you disagree. They deliver until 5am, their pizza is the best, and the wings and everything else can't be complained about. The 4 stars only because their sauce isn't the best for reheating. Have to eat their pizza hot to get the best taste. All good - it's still better than jokes like NYPD and Streets of NY. A place that serves slices but doesn't have a slice pie going and prepares all their slices to order shouldn't have the letters NY anywhere near they're name.",

Slice of pizza was huge, Philly cheesesteak was delicious, and their macaroni bites were off the chain!   The only downside to the place was that the service was slow and the server forgot my husband's drink and food order. It also took her a while to check us out. They weren't even really that busy so I don't know what the deal was. She was nice though. Also, when I called late that night to place a delivery order, they told me it would be 2 hours for delivery.   I would go back though if I was ever in the area just because they're open late and the food was pretty good.",

I even mentioned to our waiter that we were from Louisville and he seemed impressed with our knowledge of the menu. I asked prior to ordering of they had meatballs bec they have always been notorious for running out. The waiter confirmed that they had them so we ordered two white pizza slices add meatballs, a classic favorite of ours. 30 minutes later our waiter comes out with the news that they sold the last of their meatballs on the last to go order. Wtf?!? I asked before I ordered and it took them 30 mins to figure out they didn't have any..... So the waiter took it upon himself to put philly meat on our slices instead of asking us what we wanted. Moments later he brings the under cooked slices that we didn't order to us with the check already totaled up. He never once apologized for the miscommunication and offered no reconciliation either. $15 for two slices that weren't even what we ordered. We won't be back. And all of the kitschy nostalgia we missed from the LouKY locations is not found here, just the poor customer service made the cross country trip.",

    "text": "From all the good Yelp reviews, you would think this place is actually good place to dine. When my partner and I got there, there was no host to greet and seat us, nor was there a sign saying \"seat yourself\". So we decided to awkwardly seat ourselves. We waited about 10 minutes before someone finally acknowledged us. After ordering, we literally waited about 40 minutes for our food. Throughout this whole time, our server didn't even check on us. Only to bring our drinks. I would be understanding if it was crowded, but there were literally 3 other tables. The bar was pretty full though, but a quick 'your food is coming right up' would've been nice. We finally get our food (philly cheesesteak sandwich and a slice of bbq chicken pizza). The philly had no seasoning whatsoever. It tasted like I was eating plastic. The pizza was decent, but everything was cold once it arrived. I never would think it takes 40 mins to an hour to make a sandwich and a slice a pizza. What made things even more frustrating was a group of teenage girls came in, ordered an entire pizza, and were eating within 15 minutes. While attempting to eat this cold, flavorless sandwich another group of young people come in, and they are instantly greeted from one of the servers. The server was obviously friends with them because she ran to them and started dancing with one of the guys who walked in. So to summarize, no one greeted me and my partner, but they greeted their friends. We had to wait almost an hour for our food, which btw was only a sandwich and a slice of pizza, while a group of loud teenagers got their pizza within 20 minutes. Our food was not only bland but it wasn't even hot and fresh. I also had to tell another waitress to go get our waitress just so we can get our bill and leave.. This place is a disaster.

    "text": "I think this is either the first or second time I have left a review for somebody but I felt I really needed to make the effort.  We were having to stay a few nights in Scottsdale and after a real tough day decided to just go to our hotel room and order a pizza.  I was able to order online and they gave us a delivery time.  A few minutes later that time was changed to an additional half hour but we excepted it.  We ordered the Supreme pizza which I think is the most expensive one on the menu and then were charge a delivery fee plus had to pay the gratuity online with a suggested 15%.  This made this the most expensive pizza either of us had ever ordered.  We were alright with that because we were hungry and tired and just wanted good food delivered.   This ended up being the the most expensive and worst pizza we had ever had.  We both agreed that a dollar microwavable pizza would have been better.  We threw out over half of the pizza because there was hardly any toppings on it and it was hard.  While eating it my tooth started to hurt and the next day I noticed I had actually broken the tooth on the pizza, which happened to be attached to a bridge so will eventually cost be lots of money.  We will continue to tell everybody we know in the Phoenix area to stay away.",

    "text": "Visiting area and I was in the mood for pizza.  I checked out top places in Tempe and found Spinelli's Pizzeria in the top 10.  It was a short walk from the light rail to their front door.   I was a little concern if the kitchen would still be serving at 10 pm but was very pleased they make pizzas until 5 am. Seating was no problem.  They had a DJ playing music which was okay but a little loud.  Service was outstanding and great with suggestions.  I remembered to check in and was rewarded with a free dessert.   Now the hard part was deciding what to do for dinner. We went with the pepperoni knots and a meat lovers pizza.  Pizzas are 18 inches and hand tossed to a thin crust.  We did a full pizza even though we could have gotten a slice, but we wanted leftovers.  As a note, the slices were about the size of a quarter of a full 18 inch pizza.  However you do the math, they were huge.   Knots were great and flavorful.   Pizza was also great.  It was not greasy, had a thin crust and sauce did not have a sharp acid taste but was sweetish.  Our dessert was deep fried oreos.  Sweet and nice way to end meal.  Yes, this time I did save room for dessert.  I was glad we found Spinelli's, they did a great job at satisfying  that pizza craving.",

It's just a quick walk from my humble abode in the \"Hipster Compton\" neighborhood. The place fits in well with the downtown vibe, it's very lowkey hipster, similar to Gringo Starr. I find it weird they had no music playing, instead New Girl on Netflix on every TV screen.   This was right as PokemonGO was going crazy, so they had an Ash & Misty shot special advertised outside. He really just wanted pizza. We ordered a whole pepperoni pizza, and it took awhile [no complaints]. The way my brother described this pizza, you'd think it was the best thing since sliced bread. I wasn't terribly impressed, but I did like the crust and how carbo-licious it is. The slices were almost as big as my face, so we took them to-go. Not sure if that is why the price for an entire pizza is a little high. Probably just worth it in the future to come for a slice.",

    "text": "This is a preliminary review of Spinelli's Pizzeria in that it only involves their delivery service and items ordered online for delivery to the house. To be fair, this restaurant will be reviewed again in person at a future time and the rating may change at that time.  One of the things that attracted me to this restaurant is that they will deliver until the wee hours of the morning. They don't shut down until 5 a.m.   The best cheesesteaks I have eaten are in Philly, so I ordered a Cheesesteak Stromboli for myself and a regular Cheesesteak Sandwich for companion.   The cheesesteak sandwich is served on a roll imported from Philly, and can be had with a choice of 3 different cheeses. Veggies are optional but not charged for.  The Stromboli reminds me of a calzone in that the fillings are inside of a stretched piece of pizza dough. Again, veggies are optional but available at no additional charge.  At $10.50 for a normal Stromboli and $19.50 for a large, the prices seemed a bit steep, but a good sandwich or Stromboli can be worth the money.  I ordered our sandwiches, keeping in mind that the restaurant posts that delivery takes between 45 minutes and an hour. Two hours later our food had not yet arrived. I called the restaurant to inquire about our order and they said it would be ready to sent to us in about thirty minutes. Almost three hours went by before our order came. Not exactly one hour service, and the food was lukewarm. Putting it in the oven for about 15 minutes helped immeasurably with the flavor.  The sandwiches were of fair size and quality, but in my opinion nothing special. Perhaps eating in the restaurant will reveal a different experience.  I must admit I was not very impressed by the service or the quality of the sandwiches. I can't remember ever having take out take three hours to arrive. We felt that $33.83 for 2 sandwiches delivered to the house was a bit steep.  2 Stars for delivering until 5 a.m.",

They were one of the few places open late and so I decided to try them out despite the prices being a little high. However the menu sounded great so I tried it. After the first time, the food was okay and so I decided to order twice more to get a better idea of the food. I made a mistake. The cheese bread was good. That's about it. I tried the slice of pizza which was so bland and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. The pizza looked awful. Then I decided to try the fired s'mores. Even worse idea. The dough or batter was still raw! I love eating late since I work late and thought this could work but I was wrong. When I asked to at least get a refund or credit to use for another order I was told they don't do that after the first day even though I ordered at 2am. After the disappointing food and customer service I will no longer be eating here. From what it looks like online, the pizza when fresh is great. Mine was far from fresh though, and the fact that they serves me this after spending 30 bucks there after delivery is laughable. Sticking to Zios for my late night pizza.",

Loved the interior of the building, reminded me of an upscale Gotham City, in a good way. Music was really chill, I enjoyed everything that was playing. Our server/bartender was overly friendly and helpful. She got slammed right as we were leaving with a large group of cyclists. She handled all the chaos very well! We loved our food, service, and cool atmosphere. We will definitely put this on our rotation of Mill Avenue spots. Thanks again, we appreciate what you guys are doing!",

You know THAT place, up the street from the liberal arts college where everyone can hang out, that makes you feel like you're at home. This is it.  It's not another mill avenue trend spot with food only a teenager can eat (caugh*mellomushroom*cough*Zipps).   The pizza is delicious and reminiscent of the former Pizza Heaven off 7th St, before the renovation.  The wings are the best in Tempe. (Yes, better than Long-Wongs and far more juicy than anything you can get on mill avenue^100). They have really interesting flavors. I had the more traditional hot wings, but I've heard the peanut butter and jelly wings are totally worth it. Until this place, ATL in Chandler was the only place to get a really juicy chicken wing....like the famous Rosco's chicken.  We also enjoyed the $3 Long-Island specials, tasted some local brews, and a variety of vodkas and cider.  The people who work there make you feel at home; this is definitely worth a stop. A great place to meet up with friends for a slice before you head out to the beach park or game!",

I get their white pizza by the slice (slices are huge) but I've tried their chicken strip appetizer, and it was great. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the tables are a bit dirty when you go in, and the bathrooms could use a bit of upkeep.

When we finally landed and got through customs, we had missed our other flights and they sent me to Phoenix. I was starving. Everything was closed. I went to a hotel where everything was closed. I asked if there was any way to get food. They said no. I went on EAT 24 YELP APP and found Spinelli's Pizza. They delivered me the best Meatball Sandwich I have ever had, and it was 4 AM.",

They have a rock decor theme and merchandise for sale along with TVs for watching the game. There's extra seating at the top of loft area and also where the restrooms are located. An entire pizza is $34 and a slide is $8.50 - which is pricey for the entire pizza or slice, but the dough was delicious. It had its chewiness with just the right amount of dough where you want to finish the crust because it was light. We had a half and half pizza with supreme and chicken bacon ranch - I personally liked the chicken bacon ranch more, but my friends love their supreme. Definitely request to get their ranch dip because it definitely goes well with their pizza and their sauces are all homemade. Also, if you check in, you receive 1/2 and order of fried Oreos and the worker honored two of our check-ins so we got 2 fried Oreos that we split among 4. It was tasty and doughy too. Solid spot for pizza with TVs to watch games. Loved the booth seating and the attentiveness of the waiter throughout our meal.",

Prices can get little bit high if you pick your own toppings, my roommate once payed like $12 dlls for a slice lol  They have a small beer selection, but it does the trick.

But if you do by chance get to eat their pizza when its fresh its great!  Its around $6 a slice, the slices are big but any extra topping besides cheese adds up quickly and it starts to become expensive. For fries, 2 slices and 2 drinks cost me almost $30. For that price and the service its a downer but the craving is what has brought me back as many times as it has.  You pay for ranch if you want it. But dont think your gonna get a full little cup of ranch, they hardly fill it half full. I love their ranch which is the only reason ill spend the money to get it.  If your in a hurry i advise you to seek getting lunch/dinner elsewhere. They told me about 15min for my order of 2 slices. Turns out AN HOUR AND ABOUT 20min for 2 SLICES and this is supposed to be a pick up order and there was NOBODY in the resturant.   Service is terrible. I dread trying to get a refill because they take your cup and never return or you have to ask someone else where it went. This has happened everytime ive went. They seem to do everything extremely slow and dont really care. Dont expect compensation of any kind if your order is wrong or thats if you ever get your order by the day you order it. The restuarant is not really clean, but i dont expect much from the way it looks.",

Not much was open for food service because most places are bar setting.  Anyway,  Spinelli's gives huge slices of pizza and between my husband, Son and I we all ordered something different to appease us all.   I had the chicken and waffles pizza which I thought was so good. Especially with a little maple syrup on it. Sweet and savory at the same time.   My husband had the meat lovers and my son had the barbecue chix pizza.   We thought it hit the spot and noticed two separate group of girls about 5-6 on each table that came in too and shared a pizza.   This must be the spot to come.  The front desk at our hotel mentioned a different pizza spot but it was playing really loud music which this place was mixed, restaurant/ bar.   A Yay to try Spinelli's for that late night appetite.",

First experience was honestly embarrassing, I was one of 4 people on a weekday afternoon stopping in for a beer and slice. Loved the artwork, atmosphere, and the pizza looked great! Service, however was absent. Took a long time to be acknowledged by the bar tender, and they didn't seem to care to ask if I wanted another refill, I  left right after finishing my drink and slice. Fast forward to this weekend, go in with my girlfriend to grab some food and no joke, we were standing around with a few other very confused people on where to order, and NONE of the employees said anything to us! We walked back and forth trying to figure out where to get help. Granted there was an event going on, but SAY HI AT LEAST! Left after 20 minutes. This place is such a disappointment! Come on guys.",

Open until five like the other ones and they brought the cheap orders of their delicious fried Oreos to Mill Ave too. Haven't tried delivery yet but, like their other locations in Louisville, this is a place I typically visit late at night after a show for a few slices and Oreos. Finally a LATE night spot in Tempe where you can sit down in a comfortable place.",

    "text": "I ordered Spinelli's Pizza to be delivered to my friends house on a Saturday night... at first I ordered a large Supreme pie and an order of chicken tenders and I was told the total would be $39 and some odd change and was shocked by the price. I admit I ordered without looking at the menu prices first but was taken back by the price. Although it *seems* (I'll get into that later...) like quality ingredients, $27 for a Supreme is still really expensive. I changed my order to a large Pepperoni and the total was $26 something... much more reasonable. The delivery was quick and I gave the driver a $10 tip. To my dismay, however, the entire bottom of the pizza was burnt black. Obviously my friends and I had been drinking a little that night and were hungry so they ate the pizza anyway (yes, we did consume the product but it was basically our only option at 4 A.M. with no D.D.'s available)...go hungry or eat the pizza) and I ate the chicken, which was DELICIOUS. I debated whether or not I was going to call in and make a formal complaint. I've worked in the restaurant business for years and I hate complaining, but serving clearly burnt food to people who have been drinking got on my nerves. I hope they just didn't notice it was burnt but really? the reason why i wrote it seems like quality ingredients is because I couldn't really tell through the taste of burnt dough.... Anyway, I finally called the manager because it was on my mind a couple days later and he gave me a little attitude because I didn't  \"call sooner\" and I explained I'm not one to like to call with complaints but I thought he should be aware. I joked that I hoped they thought we wouldn't notice because it was Saturday night at 3 A.M. and clearly people in Tempe are usually socializing with drinks and friends. This was the wrong joke to make as it seemed to anger him. He basically offered me a free slice of pizza if I came in... no thanks. A proper business would offer a free pizza to replace to burnt one that was sent out. Bad customer service. I guess I was punished for being shy and debating whether or not I should even call. I've had their pizza once before and liked it. This experience wasn't a positive one though. I'll probably try them out again in the future because everyone makes mistakes and has off nights but they really need to make an effort to take better care of their paying customers.",

The waitress came to take our order about 10 minutes after we sat down..then came back another 10 minutes later to ask us again what we had ordered..not a good sign.  We sat...and sat..and sat...waiting for the 4 slices of pizza we ordered. That's it..4 slices..nothing too crazy..one of them was even just plain cheese.  45 minutes later the waitress came to tell us she was going on a break and it would be about 5 more minutes before our slices came out. 20 minutes later we finally got our food.  I gave them 3 stars because I really liked the pizza..it is very close to New York style and that is a plus. But I won't be back..the service is awful and there are plenty of similar places with better service.",

And not just cuz we were hungry at 1am. ;) The bread on the cheesesteak was super soft and meat was flavored perfect.  Only suggestion would be to have au jus with it but I was ok without. Pepperoni stromboli was really good too.  The crust was cooked just right and the inside was great. They served marinara and garlic dip with it which was nice.

One of the owners, Sean, is a genuinely nice hardworking guy. Ive had the pleasure of speaking with him several times now when I go in. He's very passionate and told my friend and I about the fresh hand made pizza dough, authentic sweet tea from Philadelphia and commitment to quality.

Almost everyone working there is terrible at their job, besides the people that make the pizza, because the pizza is actually tasty but it's in no way worth the way you get treated. We literally waited for about 30 minutes until anyone even came to our table to take our order! That is insane. So I attempted to go up to the bar to order a slice of pizza and the bartender/server literally looked at me multiple times but kept on having his conversation with some others and ignored me. Finally a server came up to us and she was so rude while taking our order. Terrible service! I can't even begin to describe. Waiting over an hour to eat a slice of pizza is absolutely ridiculous. Don't bother with this place, go to Slices.",

Overpriced, excessive wait time (took 40 min for my order) and horrible food. The Stromboli was greasy and weirdly soggy. The dough has no flavor whatsoever and after 40 min I was served undercooked dough. Ended up throwing the Stromboli away because it was not even close to edible. After spending $10 on lunch, hungry was the last thing I expected to feel. Avoid this place if you want good food. I would give this place negative stars if I could. My friend ended up throwing his second slice of pizza as well.",

Went in, ordered my pizza, ate, and left outside to grab my Uber. Realized 3 seconds after ordering it that I had to go pee so I ran back inside to use the restroom. Was immediately stopped and interrogated by \"security\" saying I couldn't go upstairs and use the bathroom even though I had clearly bought pizza 20 minutes ago and had the 'x' that they wrote on my hand to enter the restaurant. Finally, my friend pulled up the receipt on her phone and they let us upstairs with no question. It's sad that these security guards care that much about their job to question 2 girls for 10+ minutes just for a bathroom use. Also, when I went upstairs to the bathroom it was in horrendous conditions and didn't even have TP on a holder or paper towels. Needless I say I really should've gone somewhere else to avoid the 1,500 calorie pizza, security that takes their job too seriously, and dungeon bathrooms.",

Want somewhere to lay low and chill when all the bars and clubs close?? Spinelli's. Literally have never had a bad experience here and the people are Awesome. With a capital 'A'. Okay, and let me just throw this out there-Chicken and Waffle Pizza. I'm gonna let that sit with you guys for a minute. Did that sink in? Good. Now here's what you're gonna do. You're going to get yourself over to Spinelli's right now. Jump in your car, call an Uber, ride a horse, I don't care. Just get there. I'll wait here. So now that you're there, take it all in. Okay, now here's the hardest part-decide what kind of pizza you want. I usually go for classic pepperoni but they're all damn good. Find out if Anthony is working. If he is, you're in luck because not only is he a boss, but he makes the best recommendations. If not, no worries, you're still in good hands. Once you've ordered your pizza and other delicious noms, it's time to get yourself a drink. \"Why\" you ask, well young grasshopper, because the bartenders here know what's up, that's why. What's that? That's your pizza, fool! I hope you know what to do from here. Eat that sinfully delicious slice and bask in the glory of Spinelli's. Your life is now complete, you're welcome. *mic drop*",

The pizza is often dry and flavorless (with the exception of a few different types). In addition to the mediocre pizza, the water on tap literally taste like sewer. While they aren't the only place that doesn't have normal tasting water, this is a pet peeve of mine considering 99% of the time I only drink water at a restaurant.

They estimated 30-45 minutes for delivery but we actually waited for 1 hour and 5 minutes to be exact. We called about the pizza, and the manager Chris I believe his name is, he was extremely rude. I hate for this to have to be my first review on yelp, but you guys nailed it. Horrible service gets you that one star review.

If you advertise something at a certain price and I pay that price it is on your business to eat the cost of you \"accidentally\" misrepresenting your pizza price.   I have a feeling the price was right, but they assumed since it was a late night order they could pull one over on us.   Find somewhere else to eat.

This was unnecessary as there was literally no one in the restaurant. I was willing to brush this off... but it gets worse. Our waitress was the most unbearable waitress I have ever had. Never asked us if we wanted a drink, and didn't say a single word to us unless it was absolutely necessary. I was with a party of 5 and we all agreed that her attitude was unacceptable. Not to mention I was charged for ranch that I didn't ask for. The best part was the pizza. But I'm afraid I won't ever be able to come back here.

    "text": "Great pizza and great location. The only thing is tonight we went in and saw a female server (with blonde hair)  throwing away pizza. We kindly asked for a slice but she responded with \"Leave me the fuck alone\". I personally don't care about getting free pizza. My main worry is that for a company who is about the community. Why would they not give left overs to the community? Also why would a server have such a rude response to costumers! I like this place, but after my experience I see that this institution is all about profits rather than taking pride in the food they make. I will not be returning. Hopefully I can find a place with better female servers and a company that cares about their community.  If you are looking for a community friendly restaurant, this is not the place. All they want is your money.",

One of the women I was with called them out for cutting, and the man flew off the handle about being \"disrespected.\" He states that because he worked there, he could cut whenever he wanted. He was carrying a large camera, so unsure if he was a photographer for the business or if that was just a lie. He and my friend continued exchanging words, and finally she conceded by telling him to get his food first just so the argument would stop. He continues screaming at her, literally in her face, and then he proceeds to speak to the men in our group about allowing her to speak to him that way and disrespect him - at that point I remind him it's 2018 and women can speak for themselves. He proceeds to get in my face at that point, screaming \"go suck a d***\" over and over again. My group decided to leave at this point because he was completely belligerent and incredibly aggressive. During this entire exchange, which lasted 3-4 minutes or so, nobody interjected. There were employees nearby, and not a single person had anything to say. The sudden and aggressive behavior was worrisome, which is why we ended up leaving. If this person is truly an employee, he should be fired. My group and I will never return to this business because of this situation and lack of concern by the employees working.",

More than an hour passed and our food had not arrived. We called & was told the guy had just left with our food. Waited longer & I even fell asleep while waiting. Called again and was told he was nearby. Almost 2 hours later we finally received our food only to open a pizza box with a burnt, cold, & hard pie! It was horrible!

The crust on this pizza is seriously something from a fat kids dream. Crispy, chewy, and just a hint of garlic taste.   I prefer getting a whole pie, but they have HUGE slices in house at all times. Get ready to pay a little extra for this pizza than your regular place, but that is due to quality. If you want a 5 dollar pizza go to little Cesar's. If you want a world class pizza, go here.   I also read some reviews about bad service, and I'm honestly shocked. This is an alternative place, think early 2000's punk rock, tattoos, and beer turned into a business.

I mean, just think about how a by-the-slice place is *supposed* to work.   Other places: Walk in and immediately see someone able to help Spinelli's: Walk in and see a touch screen  OK this isn't a cardinal sin, but it is the beginning of many things gone awry.   Other places: See a bunch of the current pizzas on display Spinelli's: Get handed a menu and sat down by a waitress  Like holy moly I just wanted to grab a quick slice after catching Sunday night football and pounding a Zipparita, and now I'm in a sit-down place? Granted it looks cool, and the music is nice, but still...not even remotely what I came here for.   Other places: Immediately watch someone put the pizza, which you just saw yourself, into an oven shortly after walking in. Spinelli's: Watch everyone disappear for 15 minutes to reheat one fucking slice.  Good god what are you all doing back there? There are only three tables of people and coincidentally, three staff members present. I finally got my slice and it was underwhelming although not horrific. The crust is incredibly bland, as though it were made with no salt and the most refined flour possible. The pizza itself was passable, but the size of the slices need to stop getting hyped. Yes, the pies themselves are 18\" but you would think by the density of them this was meant to be much smaller and simply had the dough rolled out at thinly as possible. They cost eight bucks.   20-year-old me would here at 3am out of desperation. 30-year-old me has gone to a ton of other by the slice pizzerias, and this one is the worst.",

    "text": "$30 for a pepperoni pizza. A flavorless pepperoni pepperoni pizza at that. The service sucks. I called for delivery , and two hours later I called to see where my pizza was. They said they googled my address and because I own a few cars they thought my house was a car dealership so they didn't deliver the pizza. The dumbest excuse I've ever heard from anyone about anything. The pizza sucks anyway.  UPDATE: 5/14/19 it still sucks.",

    "text": "Really fun pizza spot in Tempe on Mill Ave. Be prepared for the crazy huge pizza slices here cause it probably about a 1/4th of the size of a normal pizza. The good thing is it's a thin sliced of pizza so it will fill you up but not completely stuff you where you want to take a nap to recover.   When going into the restaurant, it reminds me of one of my favorite pizza spots in the Bay area with kind of a rock and roll theme. Brings me back to living in northern California! Any how, I ordered the Mac and cheese pizza with a drink special. Man when I got the slice, I swear I ordered a whole pizza cause it was about the size of a small pizza! Plenty of food to eat! One of my big things about pizza is how the crust has that nice airy crispy texture and I feel they did a pretty good job with delivering that texture. With the Mac and cheese pizza taste, I feel there could of been a little more cheesy taste to really drive that side of the pizza but adding a little heat with the green chilies was a nice added kick to it. I do think there could of been a little more sauce to the pizza but all around a good pizza slice  Good place all around and a good hangout on Mill. They have a bar and TV's to watch sports events and awesome music. Check this place out!",

    "text": "Debo and Nick were my awesome Servers! My only complaint is that they didn't tell me how massive a Slice really is. It needed two plates!  I'd just hike the \"A\" and was a little hungry.  I decided to stop for pizza on the way home. Spinelli's has been on my list of places to stop.  I walked to work today so I didn't have the excuse of finding a parking spot.  I order a slice of Supreme. At first I wondered why a slice of pizza was almost $10($9.19) alone. Now I understand!   Omg! Made with love and care!   I will admit there was enough to take home or share. But after the first bite, stopping was not an option.  Even as it cooled off, it was still some of the best pizza I've ever eaten.   Spinelli's is an experience I look forward to having again and again.",

It was not crowded at all, and I visited on a Friday night around 11 p.m. Customer service was superb, the lady hosting my table was extremely nice and accommodating. It took about 15 minutes after ordering for the pizza to come, which was a great wait time. The pizza overall was enjoyable. It's greasy but not too greasy, it would have been better with more cheese + marinara sauce. The crust was cooked a little crispy and it was a little thinner than regular crusted pizzas. The ranch was delicious. The slices are decently huge and an 18\" has 8 slices. Shared between 3 girls, we still had half the pizza left after eating. The total was $26 for the pizza. I enjoyed my experience here and do recommend!",

We forgot to come back in July but had no clue where we came for the food ((drunk memories)   October 2018 we were DETERMINED to have the pizza and  wings. But we still didn't know where we had eaten before. We scrolled through our bank statements, Uber & lyft receipts and VOILA!!!!! Spinelli's !  Let me tell you this place is amazing. Always clean. Great staff. Delicious pizza. But those wings?!?! Yes! I see why they imprinted on my friend. Big, juicy, crispy, and flavorful! Now normally wings don't heat up right for leftovers.... these were delicious.   I will be coming back! There's no pics of my food because i tore it up!  Shout out to our waiter Nick! You were cool as hell and your karaoke recommendation was on point.",

Things that weren't so hot about this place - the bathrooms were pretty gross. I'm not a fan of unisex bathrooms. Keep it separate. There is also a urinal that is covered with a trash bag. If it's covered up, I can only imagine what nastiness is hiding underneath.   Profanity. They have an open kitchen at one end and we could hear employees conversations and profanity. It's just not very appetizing.   I did like the cool selection of t-shirts! The walls of artwork/graffiti was also pretty rad. It goes nicely with the Philly theme, but they worked some Sun Devil action into the mural to mix it up!",

What's great, is that this place is open late so you can enjoy a yummy slice if pizza after a night of partying. A slice of pizza is appx $7 and a box is appx $25. I wouldn't suggest bringing kids, due to the bathroom being lined with photos of naked women!",

Came here on NYE for the block party and scored seats at the bar.  Ordered a sicilian and bf ordered slices of ham and pepperoni.  Food took awhile but this place was jammed pack at 10pm on NYE.  Sicilian was fluffy and delicious, sauce was just perfect -- the only thing it lacked was meat.  (Silly me, I thought a True sicilian came with pepperoni).  Bf's pizza slices were thin crust with the perfect amount of crunch and crispiness and toppings were fresh.  First time visiting Tempe, and glad we stumbled on Spinelli's.",

The pizza was still good but, as I sat at the bar I happened to look up at the artwork and I noticed hanging above a black panther clock was a noose. You know the \"lynch black people\" back in the day type noose,  just hanging there from the ceiling. I looked around and at least 3 people working behind the bar were black so I asked one of them about it. He genuinely looked shocked. He had never noticed the noose hanging there. I watched him ask a couple Caucasian coworkers about it and they played it off like it was nothing. I could tell it bothered him the way it bothered me. He assured me that he would make sure it comes down by the next day. Now again I've been to this establishment a bunch of times and never felt any discrimination,  but the fact that someone thought it would be a good idea to hang a noose from the ceiling and management approved of it, I just don't know that I'll ever go back.",

I think first and foremost this says a lot about this business and that alone drives me to support them.   However, the pizza was delicious. The best pizza I've had in the area for sure. My friends and I shared a pizza and it was so large it was the perfect amount. I can't wait to come again after a night of partying since it is open so late. We also got the deep fried Oreos and those babies are dangerous! I didn't even know what to think about them when we ordered them but they were just so delicious. I could easily \"accidentally\" eat a whole basket myself.  The inside was surprisingly large and unique which I liked. Our waitress helped us quickly and our food came out in a good amount of time!   Not only would I come here again, I am excited to come again. Which may or may not reflect poorly on me haha.",

Went around 11pm and the pieces didn't taste too fresh, but they were still good. Hey, at 11pm after bar hopping what doesn't taste good. Brother got the cheese and was pleased. I got the peperoni and was just as happy. The waiter said the pizza wasn't as big as their slices normally are so he discounted it which I thought was nice because the piece was still huge and I didn't finish it.  They only have pepsi products which prevented me from getting a drink. After all, who wants a Jack and Pepsi?",

When he read the receipt in front of me, he gave a condescending look and showed disappointed body language because I didn't tip him for ringing my order and walking to the kitchen. Then as we were walking out he proceeded to yell \"Have a good night! Thanks for the tip bro!!\" Which was petty and unprofessional.

    "text": "On May 18th a coworker and I visited this place  walking down Mill on a Friday evening.  Wanted to try some of the smaller joints.  Once I saw a pizza sign, I was hooked. How can you go wrong with pizza?  My spidey sense started tingling as we walked into a completely empty bar on a Friday evening. Not a good sign. My date and I surmised that as it was a  pizzeria, most of it's business was done through delivery to drunk college kids.  Every thing was normal until we got our water and tea. We did order beer with the meal. The water came in a Styrofoam cup and the \"iced tea\" came in plastic bottle, the type you get from a vending machine.  We ordered a couple of large slices of pizza as a starter. (It was also the end of our food order). Pizza came delivered on paper plates and when we asked for silverware, I usually expect some clanging metal.  Nope, our server came back with plastic utensils. Do they toss or actually wash this stuff? Long story short, after waiting an eternity the pizza was cold and at best tasteless. I only ate a quarter of my huge slice. My date was polite however. Insert beer order here to salvage the evening. I do see a lot of positive reviews which really scare me as this means the general populace has completely lowered the standard for restaurant quality. But, just as I guessed, most of the positive comments were from late night customers who were either drunk students or folks stuck in Tempe with no other late night options. In conclusion, the worst 40 bucks I've ever spent and will never return.",

We asked for the manager, and when speaking to him, he said we were only waiting for a half hour which is only because our server clearly didn't put in our order or forgot about us.

Considering the number of pizza places in a small radius of downtown Tempe, seems like there's a lot of competition and this place is a bit of a dive. We ordered four pizzas (cheese, pepperoni, Hawaiian, combo) for our office the other day and the bill came to $130 with delivery! Over $30 a pizza! I was shocked - I never realized how expensive they are. We order pizza all the time for our office and I was the one to recommend Spinelli's. When I said to our admin \"We should get Spinelli's more often\", she said \"We can get 3x as much from other places for the price we paid\" and showed me the receipt. Unfortunately I can't justify that when there are so many other less expensive choices out there.",

The guy (I didn't catch his name) working the bar/pizza apologized that it wasn't ready yet since it takes so much longer for the Sicilians to cook. He offered to bring it out to my car since I had to wait and promised it would be worth it. By himself he rates a good rating on this place, he was super friendly and extremely helpful. The pizza was pretty damn big and I put it in my trunk to get it home. When I opened the box, I was not disappointed.   Each square of pizza was bigger than my hand and two pieces were bigger than a dinner plate. The crust was buttery and chewy and the sauce was pretty good. The cheese could have been a bit heavier but for that size pizza adding more cheese would probably bump the cost a bit. I will definitely be back to try their other pizzas but two pieces of the Sicilian did me in for the night.",

The female bartender looked annoyed & put out that she had to get up & wait on us.  The menu also seemed different, less choices possibly? Anyway, we ordered the chicken parm sandwich & a cheesesteak with wiz & lettuce.  ---- the bread was toasted... Overly toasted.  The chicken parm & cheesesteak were more bread than meat & the chicken parm was dry & needed more sauce.  The bartender (we ate at the bar) was barely pleasant.

    "text": "Just moved from Texas and have been looking for some good pizza on Mill and found it here.  Great recommendation of fried mac & cheese appetizer with \"bomb ranch\" by the bartender/waitress and it really was.  I am picky about my ranch dressing and this really is some of the best I have had anywhere ever.  She said it was house made.  So good I wanted to lick the container.  I ordered a slice of supreme and it was huge. The picture doesn't even do it justice. It had a ton of toppings, really thin crust that went perfect with the ranch. My husband ordered the Sicilian slice. Square and super thick crust. He said it was like eating a slice of lasagne. If you like loud DJ music there was that too, as well as some really rad murals.  Will be back for sure!",

    "text": "Root Beer Beer Float.  That in and of itself is the reason to come here.    There were a lot of national chains in this area, so we were looking for something more authentic to Arizona and came upon this dive. My friend said he had eaten there before and that it was really good, so I was stoked to go.    I was expecting a regular pizzeria but when I walked in, I was glad to see it was a comfortable dive with quirky decoration.  There was a painting with a take on the last supper with PBR,  the bathroom was unisex and plastered with vintage 50s porn with hearts and whatnot covering any \"unmentionables\" along with 50s diner tables/chairs and there were neat skateboard light fixtures hanging above, etc.   My type of place.  PIZZA For a slice of white pizza, it was $4.25 and it was delicious.  If you ordered one of the more creative pizza slices (my friend ordered a Taco pizza he thought was equally as delicious) it will cost you about $6-$8.    It was pretty standard/reasonable for a jumbo slice that is the equivalent of two large NY slices.  SERVICE The bar staff were friendly, accommodating and super sweet.  I'm not from the area, so one of them even gave us some recommendations for places to go to afterwards, one being this pretty awesome gaming bar where apparently they had Reddit Prom.",
