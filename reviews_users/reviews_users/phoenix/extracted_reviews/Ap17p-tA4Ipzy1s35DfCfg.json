But chill, it's over the course of months.  We come here w new friends every time so we can keep going back, purposefully. Lol.  It's all good. ALL OF IT. I take that back. I didn't lurve the crab salad. It wasn't bad, just not dreamy. Dreamy. Speaking of that, let's talk about the lemon pie at the end. The crust. Yes. The filling. Yes. The meringue, which I've never liked in my life. Yassssssssssss.  Srsly. This place is yum. And the folks there are not jerks. In fact, each server we've had has treated us so well and been super helpful.  In all, one of my faves.

I am taking the time to review because I want others to know that both times we went the atmosphere, service & quality of each item of food were beyond phenomenal. The hot rolls appetizers melted in your mouth, the chicken was the tastiest/juiciest Ive ever had, cole slaw the best, we ordered the surf & turf twice, and will not ever forget their signature dessert the Lemon Merengue pie which was huge and will turn you into a raving fan even if you don't like lemon meringue. The valet parking in front also added a classy touch for a classy place. Anytime we visit Phoenix we will not pass up another experience here. Must Try it!!",

We also really enjoy their brunch! We always get a Crab Benedict and French Toast to satisfy our seafood and sweet breakfast cravings. 5 stars every time, great job!",

The facility is great and the service was excellent all the way through the experience. The food was hit and miss. They specialize in raw seafood and I sampled some oysters. They were great. The cocktails were just OK. The bar had no Chambord. For a place of this status, the bar should be stocked better and the bartenders should be more flexible. The calamari appetizer was a complete miss. We rejected the first batch due to it being way overcooked. The second batch was better but you could get the same dish at any decent chain in town. My wife chose the Silver salmon special and it came out overdone but cold. Their excuse was that it is served on a cold salad. If that was the problem, maybe the dish is designed incorrectly. My guess is that the salmon sat waiting for my steak and died. My filet was cooked properly and was hot. It is a good value at $32. They comp'ed the calamari and the salmon, but I would have preferred a better meal. In conclusion, this place is a happy hour bar with excellent service and mediocre food.",

Today they were crazy busy as expected because their food is delicious and fresh. I have had the halibut, salmon, and many sushi rolls. You can tell how passionate the company is about providing quality service and food!   I believe the biggest part of a quality restaurant is the service they provide. Buck and Rider has phenomenal servers who love their jobs and the food they serve. I highly recommend Buck and Rider. I cannot wait to go back.",

He engaged us in friendly conversation until our server Marsha greeted us and offered us drinks. We ordered a couple select beverages (Your Money or Your Life and One Night in Babylon) off the cocktail menu, had a round of succulent oysters, moved on to calamari and sushi, paused with Amaro and Fernet before our burger, and finished off the evening with beer, wine, and killer banana cream pie. Everything from the ambiance to the amiability of the staff was exceptional. Marsha made wonderful recommendations that pleased our palates, nailing the perfect choice of food and beverages for us from our first cocktails to my glass of Don David. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience and will jump at the opportunity to return!",

    "text": "What appears to be a mirage in the desert is actually an Oasis in the middle of the busy business Phoenix neighborhood, Arcadia. Buck & Rider home to Abys Oyster Bar is serving up fresh sea food paired with farm to table ingredients, however not completely sea food yet not American there's something for everyone to enjoy even sushi. As I walked up to the front door I could see the patio which looked like a Hollywood set for a fancy Manhattan restaurant, the open kitchen fills the inside with incredible aromas. The inside of Buck & Rider is just as impressive as the outside again decorated very elegantly, with art on the walls including an original Andy Warhol screen print. This was my first time eating at this location, I went in early afternoon for lunch on a Monday and there was no wait time. The service was fast as I walked in the host greeted me and said I can sit anywhere I wanted, this is a very popular dinner spot so there was maybe ten people in the entire restaurant during my visit.  I sat at the bar next to the fresh oysters and open kitchen; my waitress was very nice and had an answer to all my beer questions. This restaurant does have a reputation for being pricey and for a college student this might not be the most cost effective. However the happy hour menu had multiple options and all oysters are half off, there are also multiple drink specials during happy hour. I recently limited my diet so I am not eating red meat or chicken, which was not a problem there was three vegetarian options. I asked the waitress for her opinion on the menu as I do at every restaurant I visit so I can get an idea of what I should order. I was recommended the chicken sandwich on the happy hour menu, or the fish sandwich also a favorite of the staff. I did take a risk and order something completely new I saw on the menu, the Tuna Burger caught my eye and I choose the fresh greens for my side. I was told the greens are brought in regularly so they are not always the same, but they are always fresh.  My food did not take very long I should say no longer than expected, once again I had no wait time or delay my entire experience. My dish was served on a large white plate with basic plating; nothing fancy for the lunch order maybe for dinner they step up the plating. My fresh greens for that day where grilled broccoli with pine nuts over a turnip puree, and my burger was topped with a house aioli sauce and sliced avocados. The tuna patty was as crispy as any fried chicken breast I have ordered; the texture inside the patty was similar to a medium cooked burger. Everything blended well the turnip puree was paired nicely with chard broccoli and the pine nuts added to the texture making sure the greens didn't taste like baby food.  Over all I had a great experience I was expecting to spend more money here, however my total bill was $26.00. I was there during happy hour so my beer was $6.00, which is the average price for a craft beer now days, and my burger and side were $15.00. I would recommend this restaurant if you are going out to celebrate, on a date, a business meeting, or lunch on your own I would not recommend this location for a family with children.  Thank you, G. 4\\5 will need to taste more for that 5/5 Count: 600",

    "text": "Buck & Rider  Buck and Rider has recently become one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. It is a great place to take a date or friends if you really want to impress them. Not to mention, the food and cocktails are just as great as the ambience. It really fits the definition of a 'cool' place.  When you first pull in to the restaurant, the first thing you will notice is that the only type of parking they have is complimentary valet, which already starts the night on the right foot. When I first stepped foot inside, I was blown away by the decor, music, and vibes the entire place was putting out. It felt exactly like being in a hip restaurant in Beverly Hills. Though there is no required dress code, I noticed that everybody is very well dressed and fits the part the restaurant meets. After I let the environment sink in, we were greeted by a fleeted of young very attractive hostesses who were very friendly.   Buck and Rider aims to seat customers right away, but we decided to start at the bar for a cocktail first. At the bar, you will notice a shellfish station, where professionals are shucking oysters and peeling other seafood along side to the talented bartenders. The cocktail menu is very exquisite including their own signature drinks. My girlfriend ordered the Tequila Sunrise, which she said was great, but I stuck to a draught beer, the Ballast Point Lager, which is rare for restaurants to carry as it is an outstanding one.  After being seating, the waitress is very attentive and accommodates to our needs making sure we have our waters full and a drink in our hand. We decided to order some oysters, which are fresh daily. They have all different kinds of oysters depending on your preference. I prefer ones that are smaller and more briny. They were very very delicious, and probably some of the best oysters I have had in the valley. That night I decided to order my favorite dish, which is the chicken. They only have one type of chicken there so it is very simple. The chicken comes as just a piece of breast that has some type of sauce on it. It is not dry at all and very tasty to say the least. The way I explain it undermines how good it actually is because that chicken is actually one of the best dishes I have ever had a restaurant, and I am not over-exaggerating. It really was one of the best dishes I've had personally. My girlfriend had the Trout which I tried and it was also delicious. I have also had the Radio Milano Pasta Troife and again that dish was great too. I have always been too stuffed to try dessert there but I have no doubt in my mind it is fantastic as well.  When the check came, I was actually surprised at how little it costs. What you get seems a lot more than what you pay for. The service is great, the atmosphere is incredible, the drinks are outstanding, and the food is to die for, all at a reasonable price. After leaving, valet is very quick but I might be biased because they park exotic cars in the front. Overall, I have no other way to recommend this place more and created a Yelp account just for it. Please please please go and do yourself a favor and enjoy this place!",

The lobster roll was unbelievably soft and sooo tender. I can say I am not a huge fan of California rolls but their Cali rolls have been on my mind. The food quality makes a huge difference when making a meal. This place was really affordable. The bill hit about 150. I had wine, oysters, shrimp, lobster rolls, fish, cake, and 2 other drinks that was a friend of mines but this place is great. Good quality. Excellent Price. Friendly staff. This one has left a lasting impression for me && I tend to tell it like it is *shrugs*",

    "text": "This was a first time visit, and recommended by a friend.  The occasion was my husband's birthday and we went for brunch!  WOW.   I wish this was closer to our home to visit a little more often.  We had made reso's, but it wasn't packed at the time we went (noon), but tables were filling during our time there.  We started with the oysters, and WOW, found a new type that became my 2nd favorite (kumada).  We had the hash browns - and they are done exactly how I like them, super crunchy (not burned), crab cake benedict - and let me digress here on the benedict.  I am a benedict fan, but it's becoming hard to find a good one, let alone a great one.  This was great.  What makes me a snob/picky, is I hate, HATE, when the egg is no longer hot, and kitchens rely on the sauce being hot.  And eggs cool very easily on the pass, so the sauce is a easy trick - WHICH I HATE.  This place DO NOT DO THAT AT ALL!!!   The egg was perfectly poached, I mean, I never had Wylie Dufresne poach an egg for me, but I would think it would be similar to this one.   I will be honest I ordered the crab cake benedict in case my egg was meh, but now I regret not getting a 'regular' benedict.    The crab cake was incredible.  The only reason I regret not getting regular is because both were so good it was a great overload of flavors, and I would have loved to savor each one separately.  Does that make sense?  This REALLY is a compliment..  We absolutely will be back for dinner, but highly recommend for brunch!",

Both entrees tasted fresh and savory, and though I had to admit I like to douse my lobster in butter, this time there was no need to. This seafood restaurant could have very well executed the nautical theme in a cheesy way, but instead they did it with aplomb and class. The drinks were delicious and I ordered the key lime pie after the bartenders told us, \"You have to order it!\" That graham crust was like little crumbs of heaven had just kissed my lips. You bet I ate every bite of it.

I would definitely recommend coming for the sushi alone.   We also tried the baked crab dip, which was dry and over seasoned, I can't imagine this is how it should be prepared. I can say I've never had a baked crab dip like that before! The radish slices were a nice touch, the crackers though house made were far too crumbly and there just wasn't enough crackers and radish for the radio of dip (which was just meh)!   The calamari was so so, but we felt over spicy (and not in a good way). They were cooked ok, average tenderness but not impressively so.   Prices are a little steep, and don't forget to save money for valet. I'm not impressed with places that force you into valet parking, especially with a lot that I don't think really justifies it.  The mini salty chocolate chunk cookies were good. We nearly missed them altogether and it was only because someone out of our party happened upon them on the way to the restrooms.   From what I gather some of the other menu offerings like the oysters are to die for, but I'm not really a huge fan of raw oysters.",

Luckily, my wife's aunt is a physician and prescribed me medication so that I could make it through my wedding day.

I 100% recommend that you go somewhere else to spend your money on a nice dinner. If you do go, avoid all seafood and make sure you get your steaks medium well so you don't end up like me, violently ill the day of your wedding.",

Make sure to try the pacific scallops with Piri Piri as well. They are perfection! The brussel sprouts appetizer is also great! I would suggest ordering extra of the goat cheese dipping sauce! The flavor is perfect with the sprouts! Their wine and beer selection is awesome and they have a great Rose Cider right now! It is good...and strong! If you stop by for happy hour, get there early! The bar fills up fast.",

    "text": "This is probably my new favorite restaurant at the moment. I came here last night for National Oysters Day with three other folks. We made a reservation and were seated right away.  Our waitress (I really wish I remembered her name, she was awesome) was extremely friendly!  We ordered ceviche and Brussels sprouts to start us off. Each dish was fantastic! There's goat cheese as a dipping sauce that comes with the Brussels sprouts. Definitely a must try! The ceviche came with tostadas for everyone -- no complaints at all.  The food was fantastic. The service was great. I have absolutely nothing but great things to say about this place. After our starters, we ordered at least one of each oyster that was still available during that time. (Our reservation was set for 7:30 that night.)  Overall, in regards to the oysters, the group really loved the Savage Blonde, which was a little mix between sweet and salty. I was more of a fan of the saltier oysters, especially the Conway Royale and the Ichabod Select.   The Thai chili sauce, I think that's what it's called, is a must try with the oysters. Cocktail sauce was great, but nothing beat adding that Thai sauce to the oysters.  We also ordered some fish & 1/2 lb of crab. We asked for it to be hot and we definitely were not disappointed. Outside of the oysters, the crab was my favorite dish.  This was my second time visiting and I'll certainly be back! There's a nice outside patio area with its own bar. Again, I have nothing to say but great things about this place and would highly recommend others to try it out.",

The presentation of the food is delicate yet honey. Please take a look at my photos. You can see their attention to detail in the plating. Their plating is fun and interactive.   We ordered so much food so I really don't know where to begin.   But I'll start with the service. The service was superb. We had a very friendly waitress. That is a big deal for me. I rate higher for restaurants with a well trained staff.   We started off with freshly squeezed orange juice. They do add sugar so it's not all natural. Just a quick FYI.   Then we ordered our raw bar platter. We ordered lobster, oysters and some other things. But, my favorite was the lobster and the oyster which is why I'm mentioning it.   Then we ordered their sushi. Which I do not really recommend. The salad it came with was good though.",

    "text": "I have now been here two times and both times were disappointing, although last nights more so than the first time. Last night my family took me here for Father's Day dinner. I was excited and looking forward to a nice seafood meal, seeing as this is what buck and rider is known for. We had a 7 PM reservation and upon sitting down and being given the menus (they also give you a printed sheet of the fresh fish available that day). Literally every fish was stamped sold out with the exception of shrimp crab and lobster. My question is, how can you call yourself a seafood restaurant and not have seafood? I was very unhappy with this cause I didn't want a steak chicken or rib dinner, I wanted seafood and yet nothing basically was available. When I asked to speak with the manager, he was very kind came over and apologized for the lack of seafood. His solution was to give me a $25 gift card for my next visit. The problem is, I will never use that $25 gift card because I will never go there again. They have a feature on their main menu called the lobster roll, which the waitress told us is regularly sold out. She said if you want it, call ahead and they will reserve a roll for your table. I understand when you have a fresh fish menu that items may get sold out, but this is the waitress telling us a regular menu item regularly sells out. This is not the way to run a restaurant.  If you are considering buck and rider for a seafood meal, I would highly suggest finding an alternative for your desire. Someplace like Eddie V's or Ocean prime is a better option because they will have seafood in their seafood restaurant.",

    "text": "BACKGROUND   Not that there was any doubt, but my dad came through again finding this gem!  I told my dad I needed some dad-daughter time, and he drove up from Tucson to take me to dinner.  His pick: Buck & Rider.  BUCK & RIDER: THE HISTORY   Ok, first, what does \"Buck & Rider\" mean?  In this context, a buck is a fattened up, full of meat, usually male crab and a rider is usually a female crab locked on. Fishermen like this combination, because they get a 2-for-1.  In the Phoenix restaurant scene context, Buck & Rider is a casual upscale restaurant on Camelback at 44th Street; the newest venture by LGO Hospitality owners, Bob Lynn and his wife, artist Sara Abbott.  Self-taught chef, Bob Lynn, originally from Chicago, began his career at 13 years old, as a sous chef at a fine dining restaurant in Chicago and continued on to have operated over 60 restaurants including Chelsea's Kitchen, The Misfit Restaurant & Bar, The Luggage Room Pizzeria, La Grande Orange Cafe, The Otis Bar and more. His mission: help great ingredients realize their full potential. And Bob Lynn's Buck & Rider holds True to that philosophy by any standard.   THE STORY   Buck & Rider seems to have no place to self-park, so that's a good tip to start off with, so you can just go straight to valet. Also, Buck & Rider does not take reservations, so plan accordingly. There is a huge dining room, good size bar and spacious outdoor patio, so it's probably not really an issue, unless you plan on eating at peak hours. Although the weather was lovely, my dad and I sat in the main dining room which was charming. (see pics)  SERVICE EXPERIENCE   From the minute we walked in, to when we walked out, every member of the staff was extremely accommodating.  The host/manager let us pick our own table, and the waitress was sweet and knowledgeable. She even had a hand-held computer where she inputted our order as we gave it to her and used it to swipe our credit card at the end, so there was no wait.  Let me tell you about the food and drinks!  I started with a glass of the Domaine du Margalleau Brut Vouvray, followed by the Aunt Charlie (Aylesbury Duck vodka, earl grey tea, honey-lemon shrub, served up). (see pics)  My dad and I have always done this thing where we get a bunch of different items and share, and this time was no different.   For starters, we got the deviled crab dip and the fresh pull-apart dinner rolls with Jacobsen's sea salt. Followed by the lobster bisque. Next was the avocado salad with chickpeas, feta, nicoise olives, heirloom cherry tomatoes, upland cress, and za'atar and pan fried white fish with sauteed broccolini, and lemon caper beurre blanc.(see pics) Everything was absolutely superb.  CONCLUSION   I honestly can not think of anything that would have made the experience any better.  I know I will be back many times!  5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE   *Hours: Open daily at 11am - \"Open Late\"  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbuckandrider.com&s=de4df005509639883b7bbaeab69bb405c499101e132951aa3522521e7bf73c7a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">buckandrider.com</a>",

Talk about fresh jumbo shrimp marinated and grilled to perfection. We loved the shrimp and chorizo skewers. They melt in your mouth. Then we tried the lobster tobanjan roll. There was so much lobster in this roll my tastebuds were in absolute heaven. And my husband who isn't a big fan of seafood due to the fishy taste and smell loved everything so far. There was absolutely no fishy aftertaste because I was told they get fresh seafood delivered every day. I ordered the fresh blue crab cakes as my entree and my husband got the Radio Milano pasta troife which is a shrimp pasta. Both entrees were absolutely delicious!!! The crab cakes were light and crispy with huge portions of fresh crab. I honestly think these were the best crab cakes I have ever ate in Phoenix. Again, no fishy smell or aftertaste which clarifies at how fresh the seafood at this place truly is. I had a bite of my husband's pasta with lots of shrimp in it. It was to die for!!! Everything we had was fabulous and I highly recommend this place!!! And towards the end of our dinner, the manager, Andre, came by to see how everything was and we told him we were definitely coming back!!!",

The interior is so well done that I almost forgive them for razing a perfectly fine existing building to construct the current restaurant.    Everything consumed was fresh, flavorful, and each item had a nice twist that distinguished it from normal expectations.  The highlights were the brussels sprouts with goat cheese and the crab cakes.  The lobster roll was very good as well but I am deducting points because it was bite sized.  The redfish had a mild meaty flavor and the seasoning complemented it nicely with an appropriate kick.  All in all a good experience.  Another trendy spot in the trendy part of town.",

I went for the oysters and was unimpressed. They were bland AF. Same for the rolls; I had the Spicy Tuna and California ( I know, *basic*).  The best part of the meal was the \"lemon meringue\" pie. It's more of a Lemon Custard pie; the topping is not meringue, it's whipped cream. Pie crust was delicious. I would recommend this place for drinks and dessert. I wish Camarillo's was still here.  I am a fan of LGO and Ingo's and will continue to eat there, but I cannot say I would be back to bunk and rider.",

We Love Chelsea's kitchen and really loved their old restaurant Radio Milano, but buck and rider was terrible. The food was awful including the lobster and the service was horrendous!!!   If they want to know what good service and good seafood is all about they need to visit the East Coast.   Although the management tried to make it up to us, we will definitely not come back here!

They have a great whiskey selection - had Elijah Craig 18 and Thomas Handy Rye available for a reasonable price.  Both times the service was excellent.  We sat in the bar area both times and the drinks and food came out just when we needed it.  The group really enjoyed the shrimp hush puppies and the rocky point shrimp - both you can get at happy hour prices until 7pm.  Atmosphere at this place was fun and laid back.  A great spot in the Arcadia area if you are meeting up with friends for some drinks and bites.",

The B&R House version of an Old Fashion was FAR too sweet even after I ordered it half sweet. Missed the mark big time.   Wife had crab cakes for her main course and it was delightful. I had the Surf and Turf. The Filet was 5 star; great flavor and cooked exactly how I'd ordered it. The lobster however, not even average in quality or flavor. A Bostonian would have been embarrassed for that poor lobster.  Dessert was 5 star as well.   As a Frequent (weekly) Chelsea's Kitchen regular, it feels as if B&R tries too hard to take it to the top step, but misses the mark. Beautiful building inside and out. The ambiance is a little loud, even though it looks as if they've tried to address this with GIANT acoustic baffling hanging in the open-faced steel trusses in the ceiling.   Good luck B&R! Keep tweaking your menu and price-point! As an Arcadia resident we'd love to see you succeed!",

I highly suggest trying one and enjoying their awesome patio!   When it came to food I had the avocado toast which was absolutely amazing! It comes with a fried egg on top which I though was kind of weird at first but I ended up loving it! I also had the hashbrowns which were super good as well! They come in a skillet and there are plenty to share with your friends! My friend had the smoked salmon Benedict which she said was better than Breakfast Club  The salmon was so fresh it tasted like it was just caught that day! A classic Bennie and totally worth the calories with the homemade vegan English muffins!   The hostess greeted us with a smile as soon as we walked in the door which set the bar for the rest of the experience. Our server had great suggestions and answered every question I had flawlessly! Our drinks were never empty (including the mimosa) and the manager even stopped by just to see how everything was tasting! We really felt welcome the entire meal.   It was over all an excellent experience! I would suggest Buck and Rider for your next brunch date!   The patio is also dog friendly!!",

Then we ordered the Caesar Salad with Salmon. The salmon was tasteless and had no consistency or firmness. It was obviously Farm Raised. I verified that with the waitress and she confirmed it was Farm Raised.  We couldn't finish it so we ordered the Calamari, which I had heard was quit good.  Well it had a smell that wasn't appealing at all and the oil it was cooked in was old smelling and they were very greasy. so the waitress said she talked to the manager and she was adjusting the calamari and salad OFF the bill. Then we ordered the Lemon pie...it was so runny and it was in 3 separate piles when we finally got it delivered. Our waitress apologized for everything as she too noticed what we had noticed.  So I get the bill and paid it....now in the car I noticed it was $66.00+ dollars...but not itemized, so I can't believe $66.00 for 12 Blues?....all we had was Sparkling water, no drinks to ruin our pallets.    It was recommended by our business attorney and others that you had the best oysters, and this was spot on...but the rest is something I need to reconsider before I reach out to my friends and and associates and let them know how it was.    I just don't understand, the place wasn't busy at all and plenty of servers standing around....but the food wasn't anything to rave about only awful. There were also employees sitting next to us and across from us. I could tell as they ordered things from the wait staff, they were obviously having some challenges as it seemed like a meeting of sorts and had on their server aprons and serious faces....what a class act....NOT.  My date was a business investor from Greece with limited English at hand and had gone on-line and taken snapshots of some of your entrees so she could show the waitress what she wanted but the waitress said on 3 of the items that she was shown that \"we don't have that anymore\"...so this was also disturbing....what's the point....who discontinues an avocado salad with salmon......pretty simple request.  Can you help me understand?.....The bar was hopping until the happy hour ended.  I was truly embarrassed.  Thanks  Kim",

So delicious. It ended up being $13.5 for a bottle and 2 glasses of wine each. It allowed us to splurge on the meal. We also ordered the PEI mussels for an ap. The broth was amazing; I wanted a spoon and the little chunks of chorizo, the hubs and I fought over. He ordered a surf and turf (filet and lobster tail) and I ordered the scallops over polenta. At first I was disappointed in the size of my meal. It was four medium sized scallops. But with the polenta and mushrooms, and bacon and all of it, it ended up being perfect. I was completely full, not able to get dessert, but my plate was clean. Oh, and it was plate scraping delicious. Also a waiter suggestion. So I say GO! And ask your waiter's for suggestions. They really know the food well! And if you can swing it, go on Sunday and get a bottle of wine! They are all reasonable priced.",

The oyster Schuckers and cooks seemed very professional and busy they had an open type kitchen where you could see all the action I really enjoyed this.

The noise level was incredibly high - high enough so that you had a difficult time communicating with your server as well as with your dinner partners.  Had to shout to be heard above the loud music playing.  As everybody else was shouting over the music you can imagine how it sounded.  The wait staff was efficient for the most part.  Very friendly people.  Had the dinner rolls for an appetizer - they were great.  In our group of 4, I ordered the pan fried sea bass; my wife ordered grilled diver scallops; my daughter had the salmon and her friend ordered a small filet steak.  The salmon came you very good.  The steak was very small and rather plainly presented, but came with a sauce that was excellent.  My sea bass came out not looking like sea bass at all - it was two flat fillets of fish that were breaded and fried just like the menu said.  However, any other sea bass I've ever had has been larger, fluffier pieces.  There was no distinctive flavor - I could have been eating tilapia for that matter.  My wife's dinner was delivered in error - they brought her a salmon rather than the scallops she ordered.  They took that away and it took 15 minutes for them to return with the scallops - after the rest of us were almost done eating.  Her new order should have taken #1 priority in the kitchen.  Scallops only take 5-7 minutes to cook properly.  Instead her reorder was just mixed in with all the other orders and took too much time.  You could also tell that by the fact that they also brought her another loaded baked potato with the scallops.  That said, however, she said they were good.  By the way - the sides are great.  The loaded baked potato is a meal in itself.  Our bill for 4 entrees, 1 appetizer and a bottle of wine was just under $200 - $240 with a 20% tip. Plus a $5 tip for the almost mandatory valet parking.  For that kind of money, I expect a finer dining experience.  With our uneven experience, and especially the extreme noise, I don't think we'll be going back.",

    "text": "This place came highly recommended and has a great rating here but my family and I were greatly disappointed. Buck and Rider did not live up to the hype. There were six of us and we started with the Brussel Sprouts, mussels, and calamari. The Brussels were solid and the tastiest dish of the night but some weren't charred all the way. The calamari was rubbery. Mussels were solid but nothing to write home about. Next Oysters. Fresh. Can't really mess that up. I had the crab cake which again solid but underwhelming. That seemed to be the theme of the night as everyone said the same of the scallops, sea bass, and grouper. It's a good restaurant with ok service. If you're looking just for mediocrity for a high price then this is the place for you.",

I tried the Nik Nik which was very small and not traditional, the soup was marginal for the price, rolled crab sushi was suspect, The Thai Dressing was offensive, the \"Prime\" steak came out over cooked, the \"sea bass\" should be explained better.  The dessert was flat, service was mixed with quick apps but entrees took 30+ minutes, seemed like we were forgot. Cocktail and wine refills not offered, we had to grab a different waitress to get us a glass of water, I could go on but I wont be back.",

    "text": "This is our go-to for not only oysters but sushi as well.  I took my 15-year-old here a few weeks back for her first time (we have been coming for years)... and she absolutely fell in love with their brunch. She had the hash skillet and I stuck with my trusty sushi (freshish sushi in the valley in my opinion). What was nice is it wasn't to packed when we showed up and because I love to sit at the bar the tender was gracious enough to allow us there.  Fast forward 10 days... \"dad we have to go back to Buck\"... so this past Saturday we showed up and took a hightop for four. The waitress was amazingly attentive. I don't eat steak so she was able to explain the different cuts to my 12-year-old son.  But let's back up for a minute. The time I brought my daughter the first time the tender was so cool as my daughter is a huge bread fan if they could make her the dinner rolls... something I guess they don't do often before noon but she hooked her up anyway (super cool thing to do).  Back to the steak... so when we sat down all this kid wanted was a steak... the only steak on the menu was a breakfast steak... the waitress again super cool said \"of course we can get you any steak you like\" (really went above and beyond)... after explaining the different cuts he selected the petite medium rare. Came out perfect. Kid devoured that like it was butter and it looked that way.  My daughter who had never had an oyster in her life (took me until I was in my 30's) was taking shots of them with us... they were and always devine, followed with some Rocky Point shrimp, few scallops, and the dinner rolls just to start. (And kudos to the shucker btw... prob one of the best I have ever known and always go out of my way to thank him).  I ended up with my trusty sushi, daughter did round two of the hash skillet, son steak, and wife had the half lobster.  Everything is flown in daily and you can taste the difference.  Remember that HH is I believe 1130-7 all day which means half off items on the board.  Cannot recommend this place more!",

Dark inside where depending where you are sitting, it is difficult to read the menu.  Came here for family birthdays and started with the Salt and Pepper Crispy Calamari which came with 2 dipping sauces. One was a Thai Dipping sauce and the other was almost like a chipotle sauce. Calamari was nice and firm with excellent batter.  Ribeye with baked potato fully loaded. Buck and Rider serves LGO Reserve Black Angus Beef, grainfed and aged 25 to 35  days. Ribeye was very tender and prepared medium rare as requested. Beef was a good size cut at 14 oz for $37.  Service was excellent and the parking is mainly valet",

We also ordered a Voodoo Fried rice for the table, it was so good.  I had the scallops and they were perfect.  For dessert we shared the last piece of the lemon pie, it was to die for.  The crust is my favorite part.  I also went for mother's day brunch with the family and it was a blast, I enjoyed a couple of aperol spritzes.

    "text": "Finally was able to make an evening out of visiting Buck & Rider. Was asked to find a decent restaurant for my wife and her boss from out of town. Five of us sat for dinner. The first thing about Buck & Rider  that you notice is how loud it is. The restaurant wasn't even full but it was a little difficult to hear somebody talking directly across from you. The design of the interior has multiple hard surfaces including banquettes upholstered in Tufted leather seating.  It is really quite beautiful and well put together with a very eclectic aesthetic.   Table ordered two appetizers. The calamari which was delicious lightly breaded And came with some incredible sauces. The second appetizer was the Brussel sprouts. Which have surged in popularity over the years and a lot of different places do it differently. What I did like about this preparation was that it was dry and crunchy. Hopefully that was their intent it was tasty. For dinner I had the surf and turf. perfectly cooked lobster the second time it came out.  steak was amazing and also perfectly cooked and seasoned well. We had the grilled asparagus which is one of my favorite things to do at home anyway it was quite delicious. The wine selection was decent but not too deep. the offer to get the wine decanted was well received at our table. Big red wines need to breathe.  I have to say everybody finished everything on their plate the food was good. The best part of the evening was when I ordered the lemon meringue pie. That was truly the best lemon meringue pie I've ever had. Made the dinner complete an experience worthy of another trip back. If you go get the lemon meringue pie. Get your lobster steamed. Enjoy the wine.",

    "text": "Outstanding above and beyond service and dishes I'm still trying to recreate in my kitchen!  We were all so blown away that any meal we had the rest of our trip we compared to this one, and nobody topped it. Not only did our waitress and the chef go above and beyond but it was the best food we had that weekend.   On a recent trip to Arizona my mom and our friends came here for brunch. I've been a vegan almost 20 years and know my way around certain menus to order things that suit me and there's always the safe bet of a salad on the menu, though I had already been eating a lot of salads that weekend. Going to a seafood restaurant I was totally fine with just having a drink, enjoying conversation and eating something later instead of looking for ways to alter any current options to avoid meat, cheese, milk fish, eggs, etc.  Against my pleading to not ask, the women at my table all asked our waitress, Emma, about vegan options. It seemed like this was the first time she had ever been asked this question (not surprisingly) and had no idea what would be an item to suggest, she could have left it at that, but instead went back to the kitchen and talked to the chef and told us that he would be coming out to our table. I'm now thinking, oh goodness I don't want to be annoying and difficult, I'm fine with just having a drink.   Chef Greg came out and we were left totally impressed. I had no idea what I wanted but I didn't want him to go out of his way, because I get it, I'm a vegan, in a seafood restaurant, I don't except it to be a place where I'll find something. But he said he happened to have some tofu in the kitchen (seriously? what world am I in that a seafood restaurant happens to have tofu in the kitchen and that the chef knows how to prepare it?). He said he had me taken care of and would whip something up. We were all stunned that he was happy to make something not on the menu but then also just create something off the top of his head!? Then the food came out. Not just a main dish but he made an appetizer to end all appetizers, since everyone else at the table had ordered one.  It was a ceviche with tofu, mango, avocado, olive, red onion. cilantro(?), lime(?), (what else was in there? Come on chef Greg I need this recipe!) micro greens on top and it was the best dressing I've ever had. Later when Emma asked if she could take the bowl we all said \"No! We're still dipping thing into it!\" Haha. This was so amazing I've been trying to recreate it at home and really think this deserves to become an item on the menu. Sorry, not sorry if anyone tries to order this in the future. it was light, citrusy, refreshing and the dressing was liquid gold that everyone at the table couldn't get enough of and we pretty much licked the bowl clean.  The main dish was crunchy fried rice, charred tofu steak with veggies and presented like a 5 star restaurant. This was so good I took home the tiny bits I had left to have for a snack later.   Thank you Emma for giving so much concern to us and being so polite, lovely and accommodating and thinking on your feet when everyone at our table had so many questions! Thank you Chef Greg for blowing our socks off and ruining every other meal on our trip :) First time I've had a chef make something for me off menu and probably the last, until we stop by here again on our next trip...",

Our waitress seemed to dislike us, was less than interested, and our glasses were frequently empty. One of us mentioned this to the manager and he comped us a round of drinks which was appreciated. But the service we received was ridiculous for the amount of $ we spent, which ended up being around $100 per person before tip. The next time I came with my sister and we sat at the bar. The bartender was great and attentive. Then I hear from a good friend that she had a horrible experience this past week. The waitress essentially kicked them out saying they were closing at 10 pm. The restaurant was still full.They had wanted to order dessert and coffee but weren't given the chance. They mentioned something to the manager after they had already paid and he gave them gift cards to use at their next visit. Although the fresh seafood is amazing, something clearly needs to be done about the service.",

    "text": "Such an unfortunate dining experience at this establishment.  We had a yen for sushi and seafood and decided to kill two crabs with one stone and dine at B&R.  We chose a seat at a table in the bar so we could indulge in a Happy Hour beverage while we ate lunch.  There were only a few patrons in the bar-it was wide open.  We sat there for 10 minutes-with 3 servers walking by, making eye contact, but never confirming that someone would be with us soon.  Finally a server met my eye and came over to take our drink order.  After another wait of 10 minutes we received our drinks.  Hoping to take the edge off of our hunger we quickly placed an order for a Spicy Avocado Roll and a Whole Steamed Lobster.  We also ordered a pan of Yeast Rolls-but she indicated they were out of rolls-at 12:30- hmmm.  Our Spicy Avocado roll was beautiful, unique and delicious.  Our Steamed Lobster was very small and overcooked.  Our server never checked back to inquire about our food-so we ate the chewy Lobster and vowed to order lunch to take the \"bad taste\" out of our mouth and hope for a better experience.  Unfortunately, our server made another disappearing act-and as the clock ticked-we lost our appetite and became ticked.  When our server finally did a drive by and inquired about our Lobster, I informed her it was chewy and overcooked.  She flatly said, \"I'm sorry\". No, WE are sorry to have had such a dismal experience lacking in hospitality at a restaurant group known for Customer Service.",

Great restaurant...I mean, there is nothing I can complain about.  Service, food, atmosphere.....oh wait there is the price..it's pricey but I get what I paid for.  But I did not come here as much I wanted to, because of their annoying valet parking rule.  I even contact the restaurant about it, and their general manager Laura told me valet on duty would let me pass if I told them she \"okayed\" it.  That's not the case, still have to beg to do self-parking.  I understand some people love valet parking but can't that be a choice, especially when the parking lot is not full?  Can we have at least the option to pay valet on duty $2-$3 then self-park?  Now I think about it...I went on a Sunday noon so I am not sure if they totally got rid of the valet parking or just for Sunday.  Hopefully its permanent.  Anyway, Buck & Rider's oysters are the BEST in Arizona, period.  Forget about the oysters you have tried at the down-town oyster bar or at the angry crab's.  If you are obsess with raw oysters, you won't be disappointed here.  The only problem is the price.  Even with their half-off happy hour price, you are still looking at approximately $24 a dozen.  They usually have at least 6 type of oysters (it's a marketing thing but I am buying it).  I usually get a few of each to just try it out then decide what to get next.  If you don't want to try all 6, then I would suggest go for different region (WA vs. NJ) because they can name the oysters in WA any way they want, but they don't taste that different in most cases.  They also have good oyster chefs, which is very important.  Few selections on beers but they are all good beers.  Good selection on food too.  Only wish they are close to my house.  UPDATE 6/21/2017 - I actually receive several messages about their valet parking.  I understand some of you hate it to the point that you refuse to go to this restaurant so here is a tip - Go early before dinner time.  I was there a week ago and I think valet is enforced during \"busy time\".  I hope someone from the management team can clarify this and maybe tell us how to properly avoid the valet parking.  It is annoying and a hassle to deal with very pushy valet staffs when there are obviously parking spaces at the self-parking lot.",

This hot new seafood centric restaurant has only been open for a week, but you wouldn't know it based on our experience.  My husband and I enjoyed an early dinner date night at newly opened B&R tonight and had a fun and memorable meal.  It's group service, but Mia was our main server and did a fabulous job!    We enjoyed sharing the following: -a half dozen oysters -snapper ceviche -lobster roll -calamari  It was all fresh and delicious, and paired perfectly with the glass of wine (Domaine Serge Les Boursicote Sancerre) I selected.  It's worth noting that they also offer a solid cocktail list for all of you cocktail connoseiurs ;)  We sat inside but right on the border of the outdoor patio... We enjoyed an almost perfect view of Camelback mountain.  I say \"almost perfect\" as there is also a view of a Jack in the Box sign that gets in the way ;)  The bathrooms are spacious, clean, and classy, as is the architecture of the restaurant; all fitting of the inspiration behind the space; a house located in a swanky beach town on the Australian coast.  In addition to complimentary valet, B&R offers patrons LGO's signature sea salt chocolate chip cookies on your way out... it is the perfect sweet ending to your meal.    For now B&R is open for dinner only, 6 days a week (closed Monday).  I hope they will extend their hours into lunch soon.  This is definitely a welcome addition to the 'hood!",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me here on a Saturday night for my birthday. He made a reservation for 6pm and the hostess asked if there was any occasion being celebrated and he said my birthday.  We started off with a couple glasses of Chardonnay $42 (6 glasses) For appetizer we ordered bread. $7 It was a little dry and not worth it. (They should just offer those rolls for free). For entrees we ordered the Papago combination $75, ribeye steak with fries $37 and scallops entree w salad $29. Let me say I love their assortment of sauces that come with the seafood.  The assorted platter of seafood lobster, king crab, shrimp, lobster claws and oysters was pretty good but my favorite were the oysters. They were super fresh and flavorful. We ordered 6 more buck and rider oysters $22 after (they come al la carte). The ribeye was ok. Not the best steak I've had. Part of the cut was medium well and the more fatty side was medium rare. Not worth $37 dollars for a steak of that quality. The pan seared scallops were delicious. You get 4 plump scallops rare in the middle with a sweet and buttery after taste. The reason why I am giving a 3 star rating is because of the server. My boyfriend informed the server that we were celebrating my birthday and she just said ok. Then at the end of the dinner she asked if we wanted anything else. So he mentioned again if they did anything for birthdays. She said, oh did you want dessert? We got the key lime pie and it came with a candle. We got the check and they charged us for the birthday pie.  That's fine that they don't give free pie for birthdays but it would be nice to be informed that they don't offer anything special for birthdays so we don't get disappointed. Why ask in the first place if we're celebrating an occasion? I mean we spent over  270 dollars that night, the least they could do is make us feel special or at least be thorough about their occasion policy.  Anyways, one good tip I have, I probably won't ever go there for a normal dinner like Saturday, but they do have a great happy hour Mon-Fri 1130-400 half priced oysters and lobsters. I'll probably be back one of those days for some oysters and wine.",

Either way super impressed with the food and the service - Sofie really went out of her way to make my dinner incredible and had all the right suggestions. Somehow I made such an impression that the manager, I think her name was Laura , came to greet me and make sure everything was just right. Because of the attentive nature and friendly atmosphere I ended up staying a lil longer to have a few more drinks! Highly suggest this place not once not twice not three times - all the times",

We were seated at a nice table ( inside/outside). We sat for a little while and then our waitress came and asked for our drink order. Then we sat for what seemed like an eternity before she finally showed up to take our food order( no apology either) We ordered an appetizer and our meals. Again another very long wait and then our diners came. No appetizers. I actually had to flag the waitress down to ask her what happened to our appetizers and she acted surprised and said \" oh, you didn't get them, I'll bring them out right away\". Well we were done with our diners long before the appetizers showed up. Once again no apology. The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because the fish that we all ordered was very good. Not sure if I will return.  Well, we did return and I felt an amended review was necessary. It was a completely different dining experience. The service was prompt and the server was very attentive. The food was delicious, my husband and I both ordered the Mahi mahi. We will definitely return.",

The raw bar selection was the best I've seen in the state and being shipped daily is freshness you can taste! From Sushi We tried the crunchy shrimp roll, spicy tuna and the lobster tobanjan roll which were all so unique and full of flavor! Later on We shared the shrimp and chorizo skewers, ahi tuna tostadas, lobster nik niks, Mussels and Brussel sprouts which were the best I've ever had.  For our mains we got to try the Hong Kong Halibut which was perfectly cooked, Crab cakes that were full of crab, Snapper Veracruz-grilled to perfection and accompanied a delicious tomato based stew-sauce and the Salmon which was super tender and velvety from the miso marinade. I also highly recommend trying their signature cocktails- The buck and rider, Aunt Charlie and Your money or your life. All perfectly crafted and pairs perfectly with your meal.  To top it off service is impeccable and accommodation, ambiance is a dream and quality food is at its best. I can't wait to come back for more!",

Mains were crab cakes, softshell crab salad and the \"surf & turf.\"  No complaints or issues, but a fair warning about the sweet chili spicy dressing with the softshell crab salad, have it brought separately, it's packs much more of a punch than the bottled stuff. For desert, the banana cream pie was ordered two ways, with and without banana (some don't like bananas.) and the server, Ms. Robles, didn't blink at the request and was at the top of her game with wine pairings and service.",

This past time, our service was downright horrible. When we were initially seated the server came by immediately to take our order before we even looked at the menu and then stopped by two more times in the next 5 minutes. We hadn't even set our menus down yet. Then he didn't come back forever and check-ins were nonexistent. They dropped off our seafood from the raw bar, but we couldn't get anyone's attention to bring us plates for almost 10 minutes while it sat there. When they finally did bring plates, they were scorching hot. Not ideal for cold, raw seafood. We asked for cold (or at least room temp) replacements and we were brought slightly less hot plates. We asked for a number of side items and condiments that were never brought. All in all the service was a zero and the food was a four, so here is my two star review.

For an appetizer we had the shrimp and chorizo skewers (fantastic!). For our entree we had the smoked trout salad (okay), blackened snapper (good) and side of crispy brussel sprouts (excellent!) the only reason for 4-stars and not 5 is the snapper was a little over cooked and salad was missing some zing. We told one of the servers (could have been a manager, not sure) this when he asked how everything was and he was very respectful and appreciative of our feedback. Our server was very good - she was Genuine, sweet and professional! They even had complementary salted chocolate chip cookies at the door on our way out. Can't wait to come back to B&R!

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. In fact, for the first half of my visit I did very much. I love raw bars and have eaten at them all over the world, from the finest dining locations to a shack next to a wharf.  The thought of a so far highly acclaimed raw bar being just down the street from my house was exciting. We had tried to get in during the dinner rush before to no avail, so I came in during the slower mid-afternoon lunch hour.   I had a selection of oysters and shrimp, which were all fresh, firm, and delicious. There's an extensive wine and cocktail list. The server was knowledgeable and attentive. I ordered a stone crab claw and that's when things went south. The stone crab claw meat was slimy and separated from the shell, with a gelatinous sheen on it. It smelled strongly of ammonia and the taste was impossible to stomach. After attempting two bites I discreetly let the server know I thought the claw wasn't fresh, quietly described the texture, flavor and smell issues, and sent it back. No big deal so far.  At this point the server silently took the crab claw back into the kitchen. He came out minutes later to inform me that the chef had examined and tried the claw and felt it was fresh. He explained they do freshness checks every morning. He suggested that perhaps the flavor of this crab was too just intense for me.  Basically, despite the slimy, smelly crab in front of us, I must be mistaken or not have good enough taste.  He did take the uneaten claw off my bill but the whole experience soured me on this place. First, the crab had clearly turned as evidenced by the texture and strong ammonia smell. The flavor was unbearable. If the chef feels that that is fresh, then there are bigger problems in the kitchen of this seafood restaurant. Second, there was no need to try and lecture me about when crab is good, or when it's bad. I'm the customer, it wasn't to my liking, and that's what matters. And I'll tell you, from my experience eating shellfish all over the world: this was bad. Finally, about ten hours later at home in my bathroom I had what I think is confirmation it was no good. I won't get into details but it was not a pleasant night. While I guess I can't definitively pinpoint the culprit the crab is definitely a \"person of interest.\" I wonder if the chef who \"tried\" the crab had a similar night, and if so, whether he or she would like to revise their conclusion.   Again, I went in excited for excellent seafood close to home,  and had a great time up until this episode. Now I can say I'm never going back. There are other places around town--many more than there were a few years ago--that offer the raw bar experience. and they won't be obstinate if something is off. You can decide on your own but we're choosing to go elsewhere.",

It's OK but not half as good as Chelsea's kitchen (same owners).  On my third visit I sat in the bar and had a beer and spicy tuna role which was almost inedible because it was so chewy which I thought was connective tissue in the tuna but when I spit out the offensive chewy substance I realized it was the  seaweed wrap.  The Asian girl I was with told me seaweed gets tough if it gets too moist, no big deal but I expect more when I'm in a nice place.  I gave it three tries and I'm just not impressed by this place. Go to Chelseas their sister restaurant instead which is really really good!",

Last Thursday, my daughter and I had the most delicious meal at Buck and Rider. Their Happy Hour drink specials are what drew us in, but the food made us stay. The spicy tuna tostadas had the right about of heat. The brussel sprouts were like nothing I ever tasted before. The shrimp skewers rivaled anything I ever had on the sandy beaches of Rocky Point. And Gabi, our server, was both hard working and gracious and truly defined hospitality. And the sunset over Camelback mountain was perfection and made our evening. Thanks for a wonderful evening!!",

We sat down for a relaxing dinner at 5:40. We had wine, then oysters, salads, and the main course. We were done at 630p. No matter how much I tried to slow it down, as soon on one course finished, the other was IMMEDIATELY on the table. I understand the need for profitability etc, but when spending $150 on a meal, I would like some time for socialization. Don't take a first date here unless you have plans right after!! I probably won't be back. Disappointing, since I am such a big fan of the other LGO restaurants.",

Our server came over right away and explained the raw bar to us. We passed on the oysters but started with the lobster nik niks which were the perfect size for sharing. We also tried the shrimp skewers which had a little kick to them but were definitely one of our favorite parts of the meal. When it was time for dinner, our server suggested the miso marinated salmon and after hearing her describe it, I couldn't say no! We finished the meal with the chocolate cake and pistachio gelato. So, so rich, and so, so good. I was so impressed by how fast, but thorough the service was. I never felt like I had to wait for anything or like any of my questions would go unanswered. Who knew fresh seafood could be available in Phoenix?! My new favorite place and I can't wait to go back and try more!",

The ambiance was great because it offered a more intimate setting with just the right amount of music to make it fun and upbeat. Management was extremely friendly and stopped by on several occasions to make sure we were enjoying our dining experience. Our server Gabriella was very knowledgeable as well, and couldn't have been nicer. We loved the drinks (I had the Your Money or Your Life and my girlfriend had the One Night in Babylon) which we both agreed were some of the better specialty cocktails that we have had in a long time. We started off with the crab and macadamia roll along with the crunchy shrimp roll which were both incredible but the best surprise of the night came when the steamed PEI mussels hit the table. YOU NEED TO ORDER THESE. They are honestly so good that I am worried my description of them will not do them justice so please just trust me and order them. For the main course I had the 8oz grass fed filet which was perfectly tender as well as the grilled salmon which was cooked to perfection. To top it off we had the lemon meringue pie and just like the mussels I am insisting that you order this when you go. Will definitely be back very soon, thank you for the great food and service!",

I was a little hesitant at first of the lobster roll, but I'm glad I listened to everyone - even the spicy mayo on it was delicious. Yes, this is an LGO concept and ultimately they're all similar in ways (cough interior decorating), but it's worth a visit.

The restaurant was clean with a dark wood decor. This visit we sat in the bar area at the high top tables.   This visit was in connection to National Oyster Day - Buck & Rider provided half off all Oysters in the shell. For this event I order one of every Oyster listed - each were delicious with its own taste, size and texture. During a normal day the server would have described each in more detail but as the visit progressed the restaurant became very busy. The grilled Brussel sprouts were absolutely delicious it was served with this baked cheese spread that was too die for.   The service started out amazing - but with the craziness of the National holiday day it was hard to get our check to leave.  But our server was sweet and was working as hard as she could.",

So it's always jam packed and you'll most likely have to stand around and hover over people to try to claim the spot when they leave. It's worse than a parking lot, where at least their you can use your blinker to indicate you've claimed that spot. Granted there are also 9 tabletops, but you have to put your name down for those. Oh and there's also happy hour seating outside. But seriously, who wants to sit outside in the summer?!? To end on a positive note, I love love love the Spicy Avocado Roll, Brussels Sprouts and Fried Rice. Mmmmm..... Their service is also top notch. :)",

I am not an oyster person (unless it's done Rockefeller) but the ones we tried were sweet & mild with a squeeze of lemon and some horseradish, amazing. Takes your palate right to the ocean. It definitely changed my whole perspective on raw oysters.     About that stone crab though... It wasn't what I was expecting. The shell was so hard it was almost impossible to get the meat out. It almost tasted like it was still a little frozen so the texture was stringy. I couldn't get a good chunk of meat because it was all shredding to pieces. I don't know if that's how it's suppose to be or not but that's just how it tasted for me. Other than that everything was amazing, enjoyable and fresh! I'll definitely be back to try more.",

THat was delicious. The atmosphere is very open and cute. Casual but many people were dressed nicer. The bottomless mimosas are a good deal and some of the appetizers are delicious. I was not impressed by the oysters though",

We ordered the Fish sandwich, and what a joke it was.  The meal was $18, and hate to say, but Mc Donald's was about the same as this. Please see pictures!  The piece of fish we were served was not even half as wide as the hoagie roll, and probably maybe 1/4\" thick at best!!!  This is a high end restaurant, I would think that they could do better than this!! This is a quality restaurant, which boast of serving higher quality foods. However, I'd say, this was a fast food sandwich at best.  Sadly the menu presented it as a top quality sandwich, which today fell completely short of even being close! And so, this Unfortunately presented more like low end bar food. Booooo!   The waitress was really nice, we enjoyed her service! However, next time we will stick to drinks if we go back.   Btw...We stopped at Wally's on the way home for more food! What a waste of a brunch afternoon.",

Well we showed up and they didn't have a table for us until 8:40pmish.  It's 9:27pm and we just finally were able to order apps.  We weren't able to order our food until the server checked with the entire table.  By the way, this is a table full of industry people that completely understand that it gets crazy and sometimes situations happen that are out of the restaurants control! That being said, a manager came by and completely spoiled us by taking care of apps and bringing out bottles of champagne to celebrate this glorious evening for our friends birthday including birthday shots for the table!!!!  It's the evening before Mother's Day so we were bound to run into this and they really went above and beyond to make us feel special and alleviate our hunger!  Thank you so much for going above and beyond, you really made our night and we so appreciate it!",

Not only do I come here for dinner, I come for happy hour, and it's my weekend outing choice. You cannot go wrong with happy hour on Saturdays and dollar oysters. Everything is spectacular, especially the oysters, market fresh selection, desserts, and the forget-me-not home baked cookies by the hostess stand. Open your tastebuds with the brussels sprouts. Who would have thought of complimenting them with goat cheese? Uhmazing!!!! Also appetizer starlites are the pull apart bread, ceviche and fried chicken. Carb up! I've had the steak, chilean seabass and scallops as my top entree choices. I have eaten it all and can recommend anything to you.   Buck & Rider is great for birthdays, big parties, casual get togethers, and date nights. It can get loud during busy times, but what packed restaurant is not?!?! The patio is inviting as the bar to stay awhile. I love the energy and don't mind it much. It is intimately dark; hence no pictures...but that could be because I enjoyed the company and food too much! Valet parking is also available if you want to get to your food faster or that quick  get away when you claw grab a handful of those delish cookies!",

This is a hideaway-feel place where you can order anything on the menu with confidence. The presentation is luxe, but in an honest way that speaks well for whatever is served.   The outdoor patio is right-sized and rich with greenery and charm.  Day dress is business casual.   Just the thought of trying everything on the menu here, over time, may also bring you joy once you experience it.   If I had to choose one place to eat in Metro Phoenix, this is it based on my experience thus far.",

Sat at the bar, where Brandon and Travis took very good care of us, and enjoyed a well made Nagroni while deciding which direction to take our dining experience.  After deciding to try some oysters and then move on to a couple of other treats to share we agreed on a bottle of Bouzeron Aligote.  The menu, both food and wine, are manageable to sort through and at the same time offer many delicious eclectic options.  A food and wine lovers paradise.   Bottle pricing is so attractive we were quickly discussing what we wanted to have next time we visit!  First Course:  Oysters - Sister Point, WA, Kusshi, BC and Gold Creek, WA  Fresh and delicious!  Second Course: Trout Salad - absolutely perfect.  We couldn't give it up when the next course came out and ate every bite.   Next:  Scallops and Brussel Sprouts.  Brussel sprouts are amazing.  I have always loved them but this preparation was truly unique to any other I have had.  Scallops were cooked perfectly.  My husband and I shared all, it was a great experience and more than enough food.  We are tough critics (would say 4 1/2 stars because perfection comes over time but...)  and left thrilled that we had a new restaurant to add to our very short list of places to return to as well as confidently recommend.",

Some thought it was ok, others weren't that impressed, but overall none of us were crazy about it. The overall vibe of the place is that it's confused. That goes for the menu and decor. The service was ok, but not great. We had about a 35 minute wait, which we used to check out the bar. We were fortunate enough to grab seats, which was nice, but the bartender, a \"gentleman\", was not in a friendly mood at all. The bar was slammed, so he might have been overwhelmed, but his service was below par to put it nicely. Our server at our table though was much better and friendlier. She was well informed and checked on us often. Overall the food was ok, nothing special. Moving forward we'll probably only visit this place for happy hour.",

I ended up having the sea bass with green beans which is a must, and my boyfriend had the Papago platter( all to himself :/ ). The food was amazing, coursed perfectly ( I know I'm a server).

In my experience, this NOT a place where you walk away thinking, \"I got what I paid for.\" Unless, as previously stated, you just popped into the bar for a few drinks and moved on to the next place.",

The food should be SIX STARS , highly recommend the Brussel sprouts and the calamari, and Thai sauce for the calamari is unlike anything I have ever tasted . The lemon meringue for desert was the perfect balance of fluffy, sweet, lemony, and not too heavy. To top it all off our server Katrina was very attentive, and very helpful when we had questions about the menu and restaurant.   Overall this place is . First time I've ever given a six star review.",

Those who answered the phone were friendly and accommodating letting me know reservations were full put they would put my table for 2 on a priority list. Made \"reservations\" for 7:30. Got there about 7:00 and the place is packed! Packed as in exciting and alive. The restaurant is such a cool concept, oyster bar, open kitchen, cool vibe. We decided to grab a drink at the bar while we waited and were greeted promptly by the bartender even though we were standing to the side of the bar. Bar staff was kind enough to walk our drinks out to us instead of handing them over the people that were seated and got us our check quickly. There was a nice rail that we were able to stand at and not feel awkward and out of place as we were waiting for our table. The \"host\" (I don't even want to call them just a \"host\" as their job is so much more than just getting you to your table, I would call it a \"table seating expect!\") got us seated not far off from our \"reservation\" time in a nice cozy seat. Old Fashiones were great, they were out of the side dish that we ordered and the manager came up, apologized, ordered us a complimentary round of drinks and handled the situation with class and great customer service. Enjoyed some amazing scallops and pasta, we were greeted with a nice goodbye on the way out. Will definitely be back.",

We were happy to see that they had a reverse happy hour, Syndi detailed their house wine for us and we truly enjoyed the choice.  We decided to order a couple of smaller dishes, the fried calamari, and Vodoo Fried Rice, both were quite good.   Cannot wait to come back when we have a little bit more time to try the raw bar and grab a seat on the outdoor patio.  We really cannot say enough good things about Sydni, she has such a wonderful approach to people and a great knowledge of the menu.",

All around- shrimp cocktail with fresh horseradish, the brunch potato hash skillet is unlike any potato dish I've ever had, dinner rolls with salt flakes, chicken sandwich is simple yet explosive in flavor, Ahi tuna burger...just get it. The atmosphere is warm and low key, and the patio has a great fireplace and bar. Great place to chill with good people.  I do wish their order in/pick up was more streamlined, and acknowledging people arriving at the bar with a simple hello/ I'll be right with you would be appreciated. However, I would definitely still go to Buck & Rider- one of my absolute favorite restaurants!",

We had so much trouble deciding what to eat since everything looked delicious! They have a brunch menu as well on the weekends, but the lunch menu seemed more enticing since there were more seafood options.   We started with the Pan Roasted Mussels which is one of the best mussel dishes we've ever had- such plump juicy mussels!  From their sushi menu we had the Lobster Tobanjan Roll. I liked that it tasted very light and fresh. It doesn't have a particular strong flavor though.   We also had the Thai Style Crab Salad which was to die for and I highly recommend. It had just the right amount of light citrus tang and peanut flavor with generous cuts of Crab. Perfect flavor combination. I don't normally find salads delicious but I gobbled this one right up.   Food came out quickly and service was great.   I loved how they gave us mini-cookie samples on the way out! They sell delicious cookies by the door.",

The other couple of times weren't amazing, but we still gave it a few more chances. The latest time I've been the calamari as bad and the manager came over and tried to make a million excuses AND tell us we were WRONG. What?! When calamari smells bad, you know something isn't right. It's unfortunate when managers can own up OR they have yet to learn that the customer is always right...",

I was asked if I would like sweetener I said yes the T came with out sweetener she had forgotten it and walked away I had to ask another waitress for sweetener.   I ordered a whole lobster and they forgot to bring me any thing to break lobster up.    Finally, once we were done we sat there another 10 mins waiting for our bill.      To sum it up, service is bad and food mediocre at best",

No wait on a Tuesday night which was nice.  We started off with the oysters from WA and BC,WOW! Super fresh.. my favorite was the Kusshi from BC. I could've eaten 2 dozen of those!  I ordered the whitefish daily special (some variety of mediterranean seabass) with brocollini. The fish came out in 2 separate filets, was lightly breaded and covered in a garlic butter sauce that was so good, I probably could've drank it. I tried a few bites of my fiance's Milano Pasta Troife, which was absolutely amazing .. succulent pieces of shrimp and sausage in pasta and a flavorful garlic sauce. I'd love to order that next time!  The waitress treated us to lemon meringue pie as a bday treat - to no surprise, this was amazing as well and we gobbled it up.   There's a few wood fires around the restaurants that make the place smell ungodly good. The low lighting makes for an intimate and romantic ambience - great date spot.  Can't wait to return. Thanks for a wonderful birthday dinner, Buck & Rider!",

We had reservations at 8 pm but they were running a bit behind so we made our way over to the bar area. I am huge fan of Chopin vodka but my buddies said Kettle One was way better. So the bartender gave us free blind vodka tasting shots to see if we could taste the difference between the two. I lost the bet guessing as my Chopin turned out to be Kettle One. I mean vodka looks exactly the same in a shot glass and in my defense I had been drinking for 5 hours now. Once we were seated the server was amazing she took our drink orders even though we all had full drinks and recommended some amazing apps. The steak tartare with leaves, and the crab cakes (large pieces of crab) were mouth watering good. As I kept drinking the night got louder (the restaurant has a great sound system and they def showed it off). For dinner I went with the filet medium well. Probably one of the top 3 best cuts of filet I have ever had in my life. This is my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix and I can't wait to come back very very very soon! Thanks for a great bachelor party kickoff!!",

I didn't like the cocktail sauce being overly horseradishy and so when I asked for some a little less strong I was given ketchup to dilute which I wasn't thrilled about... I will go back to try some more of the raw bar and sushi. Right now the verdict is still out...  I wished that they had east coast oysters available as well. I don't particularly care for the flavor of the west coast ones.",

The bar tender, you will not be disappointed esp if you are a cocktail lover. First amazing part of the night was that they have a late night happy hour starting at 930 until close on Saturday (probably the full weekend but I was only there Saturday). Not only was he easy to chat with, he was trying all kinds of cocktails and sharing with the people sitting at the bar.   Final touch and one of my favorites are the LGO chocolate chip salted cookies that are the best treat to grab on the way out (also the way in).

The patio is great, but we decided to sit in the bar area where you can get the oysters at HH pricing. Food was really good and our server was fantastic.   - It's fun trying a variety of oysters since I'm still figuring out which kind I like. My faves were the Kusshi and Conways. - Roasted brussels are pretty common on menus these days, but the preparation here was unique. They were perfectly cooked with just a hint of sweetness, and a clever goat cheese brulee on the side. - Avocado toast- a big slice of thick bread with creamy avo, burrata, and an over-easy egg. The sliced baby tomatoes were delish- so sweet! I wish the bread had been toasted because it got soggy quickly, but still, really enjoyed this and would order again. - Eggs sardou- similar to a benedict but with a whole roasted artichoke serving as the base instead of bread. The eggs were perfectly poached, sundried tomato added a fantastic sweetness, the sauteed greens on the bottom- just the right amount of crisp to give good texture. I usually find hollandaise sauce too rich for me, but this version was light and tasty. A winner! - Smoked salmon salad with pink grapefruit wedges, olives, and avocado. Huge pile of greens with all sorts of yummy textures and flavors. Would definitely order this again, but ask for dressing on the side. (Dressing was good, but too much for my tastes). - Flourless chocolate cake was great! A huge piece (plenty for 4 people to share) with a big scoop of pistachio ice cream. The chocolate was dense, and not too sweet. Our ice cream was just a tiny bit melty, nothing I would have even noticed, but our server apologized and brought us another huge scoop on the side. Did I mention how great our server was? Worth saying again!  Tasty food, great drink specials, professional servers, and a good vibe. Recommend and will return.",

It's very loud inside. The food was nothing special. The \"Ace in the Hole\" cocktail was delicious, but not worth the amount of money we spent in total.   It could be worth going if you are there during happy hour. But the happy hour prices/options are only available in the bar - and the times I've gone, the bar has been swamped!   Also the turn off to get into the restaurant parking/entrance is immediate and the valet quickly opens your door. Make sure you are ready and have your shoes on!",

That was not so bad but in order to turn over the table, we were rushed. Instead of bringing our appetizer first, followed by salads, they rushed out both at the same time.  Dinner was eh. I used to LOVE their mussels, but they were mediocre. More spice than flavor. I could not eat 2 of them because the shells had not opened. Those 2 mussels should have never left the kitchen. Service was fine, other than being rushed and our server was personable.",

I came here with a friend that was visiting from out of town so we decided to check this place out after she passed by it. So glad we did! I had an awesome experience with making reservations for Tuesday at 5:30 pm. We were both running a bit late so I called to let them know about our 15minute delay and the person who answered the phone was extremely friendly and understanding and pushed us down on the schedule and held the spot for us.  Everything we ordered was pretty good. From medium rare hamburger to Brussels Sprouts with cranberry sauce to their appetizer cocktail crab in a martini glass to tuna sushi roll with avocado. The roll was my favorite part of our meal. The Brussels Sprouts were on the sweeter side, so if you don't like sweet stuff, I suggest avoiding it. I liked it, but I couldn't eat a lot of it. The crab was simple, shredded in a cup with a dollop of cocktail sauce, nothing wild, my friend found it underwhelming. The medium rare burger was a bit too rare inside. Very red, so my friend couldn't eat the center.   Overall, we had a good experience with the atmosphere, candle light, patio table with a purse hanger next to a fireplace, and friendly staff.  It was just a bit much when our waitress kept coming back and asking if we need anything else, like removing our plates, or ordering more food. The way she did it gave us the feeling of being rushed out of there so they can service other people. I can understand the business aspect of that, but it really felt like she approached us too often. Normally, it's the opposite where wait staff forget you are there.",

My husband surprised me last night and took me here for our date night! We started off with a side of fries for our appetizer and then both ordered our entrees. My husband got the shrimp pasta and I got the scallops. What looked like a small portion size ended up filling us full! We had no room for dessert (and that rarely happens..haha). We both enjoyed our meals. The scallops were hands down the most perfectly-cooked I have ever tasted. They were on a creamy bed of polenta and garnished with mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, baked peas (strangely good and crunchy), and onions. Every flavor combined to make one of the most enjoyable meals I've had! LGO hospitality, you've done it again and for that, my husband and I are grateful. I highly recommend this place and any other LGO concept. You will not be disappointed.   P.s. Be sure to read the menu with prices before going. We did this so we knew that it was going to be a pricy meal. Yelpers, it is seafood...what else do you expect? Do not let the negative reviews on here of their food being expensive stop you from going. Save up a bit, go for a special occasion, anything, and enjoy yourselves!! We highly recommend treating yourself to this place.",

I loved my cocktail - the something Babylon - which has spiced gin and za'tar for a super refreshing, super unique drink.  One of my only two complaints was the price of the gulf shrimp from the raw bar ($3.00 each) when I remember gorging myself on local shrimp in the Keys far about 13.00 a lb. Anyhoo, of course we are not in the Keys, we're in scorching landlocked Phoenix, so what should I expect. Maybe a price break if you order by the half or full dozen?  They were fresh, sweet and delicious along with a zesty, spicy cocktail sauce. Hubby enjoyed some oysters which I had to miss out on due to allergy. When I told our server about my oyster allergy she was very conscientious about it and clearly took extra steps to keep our orders separate.   We shared the Thai crab salad noted by other reviewers- tasty, fresh and light. We also shared the Brussels sprouts which I will now dream about  - the apple gastric is a delicious and unique touch. Finally, we split the crab cakes which had essentially zero filler - all crab meat - and came with a nice side salad of shaved French radish, asparagus and red onion. The Dijon buerre blanc was very rich - maybe on the side next time...   My only other complaint was the noise level. It was super loud in there - so not the place if you are seeking a spot for intense conversation, otherwise- great seafood, great service and overall thumbs up.",

If you want sushi go to a sushi restaurant. Cry mistake. The crispy calamari were really soggy.  It is definitely a happening place.  The menu was just not for me.

They make you feel warm and welcome and it amplified my experiences here.  I started with a simple margarita that turned out to be so good I had 3 more (lol).  After I had the real crab California Roll and the King Crab on a half shell. The sushi's texture was a little dense for my pallet but all the same delicious. On the other hand the King Crab was..... Fantastic! Sweet and decident just as fresh crab should be. I also decided to grab a few Jumbo Shrimp and was pleasantly surprised at the size.  All in all I highly recommend eating here. The fresh seafood along side awesome service and drinks make for a truly wonderful experience.",

All of this was absolutely due to an awesome level of engagement from both Courtney and Christian. Courtney was helpful, fun and attentive. Because of her input, I not only had a few extra drinks but also an entree. Christian's enthusiasm and knowledge persuaded me to try a rye whiskey based drink called a Sazerac. As a person who doesn't drink whiskey, this absolutely means that his input was the driving force behind my doing so. I will absolutely be back and hope to be greeted by at least one of these awesome people because they made the experience. Separate of these individuals, the environment was great and the happy hour is, in my opinion, the best value in the area.",

Dinner was so so (don't even remember what I ordered because I will never go back) and when we wanted dessert, our waitress literally said they ran out and it was only 9pm??? Really?  Made me think it either they ordered it from somewhere and ran out OR she was so bad of a Server and forgot to mention how amazing dessert was and we better order and save a piece.  She wasn't good.  Smile was great but that's about it. We typically leave 30% tip, we only gave about 15% tip because experience was so bad. I can't recommend this place and we won't be coming back.

Was totally diggin the Leon Bridges Pandora station. Our waitress, Marley, was nice and knowledgeable about the dishes and company.   The only con was the runners and bussers could use more training. We ordered sushi and did not get soy bowls. Our finished appetizer plates stayed on the table until we mentioned it, after our entrees came. The post dinner coffee came with milk and no spoons. Just the little details that make a restaurant feel more put together were missing.   HIGHLY recommend for their food, drinks and atmosphere.",

The Ahi Tuna Burger was really tasty and the Sea Bass was good as well.  We had ordered a sushi roll, but we were surprised to find that the soy sauce presented with the roll is actually a sauce they make in house that is pretty sour and some what off putting.  They also offer Rolls in the appetizer section which were similar to Hawaiian buns, sweet but good.  We had fun.",

We really wanted to sit on the patio since the weather was nice and we did call in for a reservation but it was a long wait for the patio or a few minutes for our table inside. We choose the table inside. Our server was great! We placed our drink order and then we placed our food order as we were all quite hungry. We started off with an order of the calamari and it was great! I had the steamed muscles and my boyfriend had the spicy tuna roll (he wasn't too hungry). I have to say the size of his role was VERY small for the price so I don't think we will order the sushi again. The steamed muscles were very good. This was the first time I couldn't finish all of them because they were of good size and it was very filling. Everyone else also seemed to really enjoy their dinner selections as well.   We will be back and will certainly try other items on the menu.",

We tried all of the oysters that were available. I'll definitely try the crab claws and shrimp from the raw bar next visit.   Coffee and pistachio gelato were great.   Good selection of cocktails, wines, and bubbles. We have the Vouvrey brut and it was pretty good.   Ambience is great - awesome decor and interior and lighting. I personally like the fact that it is very dark inside - gives it more of a mysterious and romantic vibe.   Cons: the main dishes we tried were good but not great. We had the Brussels sprouts (pretty good with the goat cheese dip), the trout which was so-so, the crab cakes were ok (not worth the price), and the scallops were a little bit too charred so the burnt flavor took over.   Inside is very loud, especially toward the bar, so you have to speak loudly to hear anyone in your group. I am not a fan of this, but what can you expect when the restaurant is packed?  Overall a good place and we will definitely return for the raw bar items which were amazing.",

For entrees we had the miso salmon and the crab cakes.  Salmon cooked perfectly on a bed of faro and green beans. Crab cake was nice and meaty with a delicious mustard sauce. Nice and crispy on the punt side. We indulged on dessert and at the server's recommendation ordered the lemon merengue pie. It was out is this world. Nice an lemony with the right level of tartness on a pecan graham cracker crust. I'll be back.",

Decent service, excellent oysters, crab cakes 5 stars and the lemon meringue pie was great!   Now for the bad news.  1. It is so loud inside that you cannot have a conversation. When I left my ears were ringing like I had been at a concert and I had a headache. 2. My \"ribeye\" was a NY strip.. cooked & seasoned appropriately.. but dense and not tender. Do they think I cannot tell the difference or do the cooks not know the difference? If you don't have a ribeye- ask the customer if they would like a substitute. I would've switched to something else. I do not like NY Strip steak. I didn't bother sending it back because I didn't want to sit without dinner while the rest of our party ate.  3. The tomato/cucumber salad contained an abundance of bitter fresh mint. Very odd combination.   We are Not planning on a return visit.",

Wow I think I have found my new happy hour place too  We shared some breakfast options (hash browns and the Brussel sprouts) - both were delicious and cooked perfectly. I was impressed with the hash brown as the crust was really crunchy and good. The dollop of sour cream and chives set it off perfectly. We all went for the Eggs Benedict - salmon and crab meat. While I love crab meat, with EB it was a little different. Maybe should have tried the salmon first but it was still good. The never ending mimosas is a great option too..  loved this place. Will definitely be back - and soon!",

I decided to try this gem for restaurant week knowing they had a featured  menu. Friends have been suggesting Buck & Rider for a while so it was finally time to give it a shot.   I pulled up and was greeted by valet drivers. Opened my door and parked my car. My only embarrassment here was that I didn't have fancy enough car to have it parked in the front lol. We walked in and despite not having reservations and despite it being a Saturday night we were told it would only be 30 minutes. While we waited we were offered drinks and cocktails. They even had complimentary cookies to sweeten your taste buds as you wait. We were finally seated in a nice romantic spot with just the right lighting.   The interior was spectacular. Not too dark not too bright. Really did feel romantic and intimate. The fresh oyster bar was right in front for all to see as the masters prepped those little succulents.   We ordered drinks and looked over the menu. We ended up choosing oysters, the crab cakes and asparagus as well as the New York strip steak with a loaded baked potato. The oysters were seriously some of the best I have had. The crab cakes were literally all crab. Which was amazing. Normally restaurants will add filler but not here. The steak was spectacular. Tender and grilled exactly how we ordered it. It was so juicy and so flavorful that I yearned for more and more. We ended the evening with some gelato.   Overall way to go Buck & Rider !! Would recommend this restaurant and would definitely go back.   Only small disappointment was that they ran out of fish and only had Salmon left.",

You can watch the open kitchen, it was the fascinating, but made it even harder to decide on what to order!  What do you get when you eat at a place that has so many choices?   We ordered oysters, then requested them fried. They came back completely delicious light and not over battered. We order the New York steak,  medium rare was perfect  I have to say again, seasoning was perfect.   I was skeptical to pay $7 for a pan of homemade dinner rolls, but worth every penny. Light, fluffy with that yeast roll goodness like Grandma used to make.   Even though we were too full to eat anything else, we got the desert to go.  The lemon meringue pie was impeccable tart lemon curd, perfectly fluffy meringue that held up all the way home and the walnut pie crust was so thick you could get some with every bite.  Q",

And they were so good!!!! Definitely give them all a try, I found out they taste a little different depending on where they come from which I thought was cool. The Manager, Nate, stopped by our table to see how we were doing! It made us feel very special. We also got the Almond Spicy Shrimp roll which we both loved and devoured and for our main dish, I got the Grilled Scallops and my husband got the Surf & Turf, needless to say everything was DELICIOUS and service was great. Definitely will be coming back soon!",

When an oyster craving hit, I decided to meet a friend and hit up Buck & Rider.  I'm so glad that I did. We decided to order a few appetizers to try a few things. The oysters were so fresh and the sauces each were delicious and added great flavor. The calamari was light and crispy. The brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly and the goat cheese given for dipping complimented the flavor so well. We also ordered the voodoo fried rice and couldn't stop eating it. I enjoyed the little touch of chopping up the shrimp in it because I always get annoyed with uncut shrimp in rice dishes (a little ridiculous, I know).  The lemon meringue pie was to die for, I could eat just the crust by itself.  We also enjoyed a few of the specialty cocktails. I had the Diego Rivera and it was so refreshing, especially now that Arizona is reaching the triple digits.   Overall I HIGHLY recommend Buck & Rider as it has just been added to my rotation of go to happy hour spots. I'm extremely excited to go back and try a few of the entrees.",

She over poured the glasses and had to be told to only fill to an appropriate level! Food came and went and people had no forks or knives As they had been used for appetizers. At dessert we even had to ask for utensils because no one paid attention to the table! Seriously this is a joke when you are spending over 150 per person for dinner! Overall very disappointing!

I came here to celebrate getting into graduate school and couldn't have picked a better spot. They were very accommodating to our group of eight. I started out with the Diego Rivera { Frida Kahlo Blanco tequila | grapefruit | fresh thyme} I love a good cocktail that doesn't have too many ingredients and isn't too sweet so this was perfect!   We started with a few apps- the deviled crab dip, salt & pepper calamari, Baja style seafood cocktail, and the mussels. The deviled crab dip was my favorite! The seafood cocktail was huge and had a great assortment of crab, shrimp, and scallops. The mussels were deliciously tender served with chorizo and white wine broth (divine with the sourdough bread). For an entree I ordered the Thai Style King Crab salad served with avocado, mango, peanut, and cilantro. Everything about the salad was balanced and beautiful.   My only complaint is that they only offer the seafood happy hour at the oyster bar, the happy hour is amazing and they would probably go out of business if they offered it restaurant-wide.   Service was top notch as always, and I can't wait to be back!",

We went through almost everything on their happy hour list and loved each bite! The oysters and lobster were fresh and at a great price. Steak tartare was best I've had.  I order it every time I see it on a menu. Christian the bartender was so knowledgeable and engaging. He made a spectacular Old Fashion and presented it with a full back story on the drink. A real pro.   If we had discovered this place earlier, we would have been there every day!",

Initially, the salad I ordered didn't have the added seared tuna and she got it fixed right away. I got the seafood superfood salad, and it was interesting...it's not a bad interesting, but I haven't decided if it's a good interesting, haha. The dressing was really good though.  I tried a piece of my mom's sea bass and my dad's halibut. Both were nicely cooked and had good flavor. As far as appetizers, we got the rolls - which were good however, I'm not used to having to pay for rolls for the table. I mean it was $7 for 5 rolls. Also, we got the crispy hash browns and they were as you'd think. Nothing special, but it was easy to share and crispy.   Overall, the dinner was quick and easy. The food came out easy, and the service was good.",

One of our friends noted he'd never seen this place before despite driving the Camelback corridor many times for work travel. It really is tucked away behind it's neighbor office building. It's definitely got the cute, semi-dressy vibes to enjoy a great meal for a date night. All of us arrived a little before our dinner reservation and were able to enjoy a few drinks at the oyster bar before being seated.   The hostess led us to a nice booth in a corner with ample space for all. Can't recall who our waitress was, but she quickly came to us with waters and a welcoming face. She did a superb job from beginning to end!  Our waitress went thru the menu and let us know her favorites and the daily specials. I went with the salmon dish which was simply amazing. Most of the items in the description I wasn't sure what they were [hah], but it was just a great dish, period. Even though it's not listed on the menu, you can order a side salad before the entree for $8. The house dressing was light but flavorful!",

Sitting outside with the strung lights, and the fireplace just create such a beautiful atmosphere.  And the food is also outstanding! I am currently obsessed with the Thai King Crab Salad (big pieces of crab, fresh mango, peanuts, avocado....order it, you will not be disappointed), and you can taste the freshness of the fish in all the other dishes.  If you're looking to test this place out, I highly recommend coming on a Sunday evening when they do their sushi and wine specials (1/2 off a few of their specialty rolls and bottles of wine).  Fantastic atmosphere, food and service.  Looking forward to going back!",

We sat in the bar area for happy hour and there was a good crowd on that Saturday afternoon. They offer 1/2 off certain appetizers. Here's what we tried: - grilled Brussels sprouts with goat cheese - delicious and a big serving.. would definitely order again - steak tartar - not impressive whatsoever - giant prawns - cold w/ cocktail sauce (good) or grilled (better! I would definitely have them grilled again :) Huge, meaty prawns..  - salmon roll - tasted fresh.. good choice too - oyster sampler - can't go wrong with oysters! - rib eye w/ caramelized carrots - excellent! The meat was so flavourful even to the center of the piece. Would definitely order this again :)  We also had an IPA and the Ommission Pale Ale.. both were good. The only negative thing I could note about the place were the aggressive flies at the tables stationed at the back of the bar (they keep the front doors open to let the breeze in). If there weren't any flies, I wild have give this place a near perfect score. The food was pretty solid overall.",

    "text": "LGO! YOU never disappoint ! Oh how I wish I stilled lived next to all things LGO. But oh well. Days like this, we were in my old neighborhood and I pulled my handy-dandy bookmarks up and voila! Buck & Rider appears! Buck & Rider has a crazy definition to it in the ocean world of crustaceans. I am not sure that this is the place to explain said definition. But the name is catchy! Buck & Rider brings LGO to the next level of swank. A little fancier than Chelsea's Kitchen and putting the spin on fresh seafood in the beauty of Arcadia. The inspiration for the cute building the restaurant is housed in is from a beach house from a swanky beach town in Australia. Walking through the restaurant to the patio, the raw bar is centrally located and for being lunch on a Wednesday, Buck & Rider was busy! Yay for complimentary valet! For being a relatively new restaurant, you can't tell. Our everything was on point! We were seated on the patio on a great spring Arizona day. The patio is prime spot for a view of Camelback Mountain across Camelback Road. You do not get the perfect view of the mountain, as there is traffic from the street, but you do still have a great view from the patio. I can see this being where the Biltmore/Arcadia pretty people go in the evenings ! Our cordial waitress explained everything from the All Day Happy Hour till 700pm!!! $6 cocktails!  (Oh how I wish.. but it was only lunch time and we had to be responsible) to Abby's Oyster Bar offerings. Lots of half priced oysters and raw bar items to choose from! Buck & Rider makes sure to notate on their menu that the seafood is fresh and flown in daily. I can not tell you how many times I have put my nose in the air about seafood that claims to be 'fresh' for the mere fact that we are in the desert and I just don't believe the 'fresh' claim. This was fresh. Very fresh. We started with the Crab & Macadamia Roll; a perfect bit of crunch from the macadamia nuts housed in this crab roll with asparagus and the perfect amount of shiso remoulade make it nice, fresh and just a little kick. It was nice to get a sushi roll that you don't see everywhere else as a starter. For my lunch entree, I ordered the Thai Style King Crab Salad. This salad comes with a generous portion of FRESH crab! There is also avocado, yummy mango, cilantro, over thinly cut lettuce. The vinaigrette is also a cilantro and I had that served on the side; it gives the salad a kick! You honestly could eat this salad with no dressing at all and it would taste very good. I had the nuts held and I added on a couple of grilled shrimp at $3 a pop. It was worth every.single.bite. This salad was fresh, healthy and filling! There is an amazing looking Lemon Meringue Pie on the menu and from the pics from my fellow Yelpers, I have to come back and try it. Today was not the day, so says my OTF trainer! This is a welcome addition for seafood and swank in the neighborhood! I can't wait to come back to Buck and Ride...er oh wait. No. Come back to Buck & Rider. Yes. That's it. Thanks LGO again for amazing-ness!",

    "text": "I visited this establishment as a group of four.  the appearance is very visually appealing, we sat middle to the outside and inside of the establishment, the landscape outside was perfect with plenty of plants/flowers and beautiful patio work. the inside was equally as appealing with dim lighting and a really romantic feel without being to formal.  Our server was Angie, who was very sweet. she was knowledgeable of the menu and offered great suggestions for the table which we really appreciated and enjoyed. She also was very attentive to the table, by keeping the table clear of excessive plates and our water and silver wear was always set.   off the drink menu I had the \"Your Money or Your Life\" which was Bourbon with a Orange Bitter taste. Very tasty. Also tasted the \"One Night in Babylon\" with Opihr spiced gin, cucumber, za'atar. very refreshing and tasted great.   We all shared the dishes so we could try as much as possible because everything sounded so good. We started with 3 kinds of Oysters, the dips were fab. Avocado salad was so refreshing, the Crispy Brussels Sprouts with apple gastrique, roasted almonds was to-die-for with a goat cheese dipping sauce...it was my favorite! Also Amazing was the Pan Seared Scallops with creamy polenta, maitake mushrooms, English peas, cippoloni onion, pancetta and sun dried tomatoes and Baked Yuzu Crab Roll. My compliments to the chef.  I rated this 5 starts because it exceed what I expected from the drive by and the restaurant name. It was a wonderful, relaxing and a tasteful experience. I will be returning and recommending this place for date night or when friends are in town. If you check it our ask to sit in Angie's section, she's the best!",

From the time you come in to when you leave, you're treated like a V.I.P.: complimentary Valet parking as soon as you arrive, and complimentary cookies waiting for you on your way out! Amazing customer service: as soon as you ask for something, it's done!  Second: I'm from Italy and I LOVE fish, and I can tell you that those oysters are F-R-E-S-H (they have them shipped to the restaurant from WA state Every Day!) and they're truly delicious! I just squeezed some lemon on them, like we do in Italy, but they also serve some sauces, if you prefer. As an entree, I ordered fresh fish of the day (Striped Sea Bass was my choice) and it was really good; just wished the portion was bigger :) Their Pistacchio Gelato paired with dark chocolate cake was the absolute best I've had in the USA in my 15 years on this side of the ocean! Buck & Rider gets my 5 stars!",

I finally emailed the head honcho and got an immediate response with an invitation to return and we would be taken care of..not sure if that meant a free dessert or what. We returned last night and had an excellent experience. We were treated like celebrities and had our entire meal including drinks and dessert compted (sp?).

Unfortunately, the first time we went we had an issue with the bill and it took a little while to get resolved. But once we sent an email to LGO Hospitality they returned it with a more than generous gift card, sincere apology, and invited us back to dine on them. I am SO impressed with their willingness and confidence as a company to realize their mistakes, correct them, and gain more business from an original sub-par experience. We LOVE LGO and go often, (actually ate there last night!!) If you're looking for a good date night, celebration, or new restaurant to dine you should absolutely pick this one. They will not let you down!   We had oysters as an appetizer. From someone that loves oysters and is from the gulf I'm very particular. They were very small- but super fresh and yummy!  We hen split the avocado salad. The kalamata olives make it salty and the dressing and avocado make it fresh and the tomatoes a good sweet bite. Amazing.  I had the pasta- very obviously in house made noodles with fresh shrimp and herbs. My mouth is watering it was so good!   My boyfriend had the scallops and polenta--nothing short of spectacular. The scallops were fresh and perfectly tender and sweet. The creamy salty polenta was the perfect combo.   My boyfriend had the buck & rider rue cocktail and I will definitely be ordering that next time.   Can't wait to go back! Bon appetite!",

He came over to thank us for our gesture. Turns out he deploys for Iraq Sunday!

Some dishes fantastic - a couple dishes and one drink that weren't so much.  Poor service unless we asked for something - in spite of 3 people working directly in front of us.  A lovely happy hour with great deals and that runs from 11 AM to 7 PM - but you can NOT sit on the patio and partake of the food deals.  Hits included sensational raw oysters, out of this world snapper cerviche, hot crab dip, hot french fries served with honey mustard, and a wonderful Manhattan knock-off - (For Love or Money) - replete with Buffalo Trace bourbon!   Misses included the Spicy Tuna Rolls (no pizzaz), Mussels( slightly fishy, several nearly closed shells, very little flavor in the meat or tomato broth).  In addition, the gin and tonic didn't taste like gin - or tonic.  It started off slow (early evening) and got busier, but it wasn't ever full. The staff knew us for the first 15 minutes, thereafter if we needed ANYTHING, we had to work to get their attention.  We tried it - we sort of liked it - now we're off to greener pastures.

    "text": "Honestly, I don't get the allure of Buck and Rider or Chelsea's kitchen. Good building ambiance and that's it. I don't think their food is very good. I love Le Grande orange so that is the exception. I think their food is trying too hard to be artsy when they should focus on just being good. There are weird combinations of food like shortbread crackers with crab dip. They crumbled when you tried to dip them and tasted chalky. Every time I have ordered at either place I struggle to find anything I  want on the menu AND I normally like their type of food. Most recently, we were there last Friday for a birthday. The food is over priced, service was not very good and I didn't like the way they cooked my order. I got the crab cakes and hubby ordered the chicken. Crab cakes were dry and over cooked on the bottom and there was minimal sauce. The salad was awkward with not enough dressing and huge leaves. My husband said his chicken was bland and really chewy. I think they cooked it on too low of a heat for a long time then heated it up too fast. The servers let us sit for extended time without taking our drink orders and it felt like we were bothering them when we asked for them to take menus from the table. We literally sat there for 30+ min at the end with no one asking if we needed another drink. I won't come back.",

    "text": "I must admit, I was expecting a lot since it is owned by LGO.   Went there last night after a show.   Since it was after 10:00 p.m., I asked about the reverse happy hour.   I was told only drinks are on reverse happy hour.   Okay.   My companion ordered the Aunt Charlie and I guess it's an okay drink if one likes sweet drinks.   We ordered the scallop entree ($26) and the troife pasta ($23.)   There were three large scallops surrounded by a sauce and sauted veggies on the side.   The scallops dipped in the sauce was mehhh okay.   The veggies were seasoned with an overpowering array of seasoning.  The troife pasta had what appeared to be pieces of shrimp, not the whole shrimp.  Few small pieces of sausage and some kale and sundried tomatoes.   I have no idea what kind of pasta it was.   It looked like small broken pieces of thin spaghetti.  That dish was nondescript as well.   In fact, I thought the seasoning was a bit bland.   I tried it by putting some of the veggies from my companion's dish on it.  It didn't help at all.   Both dishes were not very big.   I don't eat that much, but if I was a bigger person, I don't think I would have been full.   Would I go back?    I doubt it.   There are much better restaurants out there.  And I feel the food is outrageously expensive for what one gets.",

It was happy hour and they had some interesting recommendations. After a couple of questions we went for a creation close to an Old Fashion. OMG was it good! Had to have another. We looked over the menu and made a request to modify the surf and turf. The chef was gracious and accommodated our request. OMG the food is off the hook delicious. Fish is flown in fresh daily and the beef is butchered on site. Not only was everything fresh and delicious but the sauces were amazing. Being a purest I usually like my surf and turf simple. This dish with the sauce was over the top great!!!! We chose a wine with our dinner from Willamette Valley and capped off the evening with a grand dessert! Highly recommend if you are ever in Phoenix near the Sky Harbor Airport that you enjoy Buck & Rider!",

This comes from someone who just likes big oysters. It could be just because I was raise on the gulf.   Next on to the entrees that we had for brunch. The crab cakes Benedict were the bomb. This isn't your traditional over fried crab cake. It was browned just nice with a creamy spinach mixture with the perfect egg Benedict. The egg was cooked just right soft and runny. The next thing we had was the soup of the day with the calamari. The soup was a corn chowder with fresh crab meat. You could taste the sweetness of the corn and the cream with the fresh crab meat from the bar. It was hands down one of the best chowders I have had. It can compete with a San Francisco chowder and even a New England chowder. Next on the list was the calamari. The sauce makes this dish. The Thai sauce is almost like a ponzu sauce which was different for me but it gave a new light to a traditional dish because no lemon was needed. The only downside for me was the batter for the calamari only because it was a bit gritty for me. They must use more of a cornmeal mixture, but I will not knock it because the flavor was there. Well seasoned and not bland or greasy.   We finished it off with the gelato. It was a pistachio and chocolate mix. It tasted homemade and not overly sweet. This is up my alley because I am not the sweets person.    Service was great even though we had a new server in training. She was attentive and even her trainer was filling in with grace.   This place is refreshing to the valley because I have yet to find this fresh of seafood.",

    "text": "As I have commented previously, this is my favorite seafood restaurant in Phoenix. The restaurant itself was constructed from the ground up, not a redo of a previously failed restaurant.  Decor and furnishings are fresh and attractive; silverware substantial, with cloth napkins.  The bar stools - upholstered wrought iron -require a body builder to pick up and move.    When you enter the restaurant, the minerally, briny aroma of fresh seafood lets you know you are coming into a sea food restaurant.  The first time I came here, my companion commented; \"reminds you of San Francisco and Maine, doesn't it?\" She was correct.    The restaurant has a food and beverage \"happy hour\" from 11-7 on Monday through Saturday featuring a variety of fresh oysters, giant shrimp (my favorite oxymoron), crab, and lobster, as well as a short list of cooked/prepared foods  all at half the menu price.  Additionally, a bubbly, a red, and a white are featured at $6 each; along with a variety of signature cocktails.   I've now had occasion to visit this restaurant more than a dozen times in the past 90 days.  The bar area is  jam packed from 4-7 most afternoons; with all bar stools and tables occupied, and a waiting line hovering.  The restaurant tends to fill up by 6:30 PM.   Extensive lunch and dinner menus, and wine lists are available - expect $50 per person (before gratuity) for dinner at a minimum.  I have yet to to escape lunch or cocktail hour for less than $50 per person (before gratuity) - but in fairness that includes a couple of glasses of the featured bubbly.  Take a look at Buck & Rider's Reserve Wine List if a special treat fits your budget.  With about 30 wines generally available, the Reserve List features wines that are often no longer available in the retail market.  An example - the 2011 Joseph Phelps \"Insignia\", a cab dominant red blend that sold for approximately $180 when it was released.  Difficult to find today; on-line resellers list it but most often it is a bait and switch and they try to talk you into a different wine or a different vintage.  The only retailer I found carrying this exact wine locally had four bottles and a price point of $290.  So B&R's $380 wine list price is not out of line.  I found two excellent White Burgundies on this list: a 2013 Puligny-Montrachet ($175); and a 2012 Puligny-Montrachet ($250);  With 4-6 oyster choices daily, I personally recommend  a mixed dozen ($18 happy hour), a shrimp or six ($9 happy hour), a flute or two of Cava ($6 each happy hour); steak tartare ($9 happy hour) with a glass of cab; and a stem of brut rose for dessert (check $75 before gratuity) - Uber - and a nap.  Service can be a bit brusque when extremely busy, but I generally find it to be anticipatory and superb with staff trained to make food and wine pairing recommendations from the well curated wine list - both by the glass and bottle.  The General Manager - Laura - comes across as a consummate professional; welcoming and congenial, but clearly missing nothing that goes on in her restaurant.  If one is dining alone, and so inclined, But & Rider seems to attract a clientele that is representative of the Biltmore/Arcadia neighborhood wherein it is located - intelligent and attractive.  [The toughest job in this restaurant is the \"oyster shucker\".  Send a $5/10 bill in his/her direction.]   En joy.",

All I can say was everything we ordered was delightful. We went all out with 18 oysters, two apps, 4 mains, and two desserts. . . hey, we were celebrating. It was a great excuse to try as much of the menu as we could and we were not disappointed. Some of the highlights, the Brussels sprout app and the oysters of course. The coleslaw was the surprise hit of the light for me and easily took the top spot for best coleslaw I've ever had. The desserts also lived up to the evening, and the lemon meringue was everyone favorite. We might not be able to replicate our celebration very often but we'll definitely be back to check out the happy hour scene. Can't imagine it won't be as wonderful as our first visit.",

The lobster was a little chewy, but the crab legs, oysters, steak tartare, and Dixie Picnic Chicken are phenomenal. Seriously, you can't go wrong with any of the Happy Hour food or cocktails!  I love this place and have been raving about it to my friends. The only reason for 4 not 5 stars was the miscommunication tonight. Our server was great and worked with us to split bills; however, when my friend got her check it said one price, then after she gave the server her card, it came back with a more expensive receipt! Later, the server realized the manager had cancelled the happy hour pricing on the to-go food (totally reasonable policy). My friend wouldn't have ordered the to-go meal had it been full price (or at least would have ordered less). Instead, she was stuck with a bill $20 higher than the bill she was presented to pay. Also, doesn't anyone comp bday desserts anymore? Not an awesome ending to an otherwise great evening.",

But with multiple bad experiences now in consecutive dining experiences, I'm a little frustrated.  Every time I dine there, the food is excellent.  That is never the issue.  But in three straight visits, service has definitely been lacking.  Takes a long time to get greeted and to get started with a drink.  Being in the industry, I can recognize if it's busy and it could take a little extra time.  But every time I dine, it's during the down time.  And today I was sitting at the bar and couldn't get service.  It took me asking a server that wasn't even bartending to get a simple iced tea.  Then I waited several more minutes hoping to order food.  After failing to be approached by either bartender, I decided three bad service experiences in a row was enough for me.  So I decided to dine elsewhere since I couldn't get in an order at the bar.  I give a three star rating because food is great.  But service definitely needs work.",

Granted that it's in the Arcadia area, it seemed for the night that the vast, vast majority of restaurant goers were above 45-50. Service was definitely on par with what you would expect from a restaurant like this.   We appetizers that consisted of a spicy crab dip that was delicious, about half dozen Crystal Point oysters that were also delicious, and a lobster trobanjan roll. The lobster roll was delicious and had a slight hint of spiciness.

Since I am a huge fan of bubbly with oysters I ordered both and they were all on happy hour. The Cava, which is a Spanish sparking wine if you aren't familiar, was refreshing and dry, the way I like it. The oysters were priced at $3.50 each but were half price on happy hour. I chose 2 Crisp Critters and 2 Sunberry Point. All of which were on the smaller side (which I love) they were sweet and tasty and oh, so fresh!  My husband and I shared some VooDoo fried rice. Yum! And, we shared 2 sushi rolls that were out of this world delish and unique. We don't care for the overbearing taste of Nori (seaweed wrap) and were thrilled to learn they also have soy paper as an option so we went with that. We had the Crunchy Shrimp Roll and the Crab and Macadamia roll.  The happy hour is from open until 7:00 pm. You can't beat that so get in here!  I can't wait to come back and try some of their other selections, like their fresh fish and the seafood combinations which are made up of oysters, king crab, lobster, shrimp and razor clams!  OMG, seafood nirvana in central Phoenix. \"Phoenix Seafood\" is no longer an oxymoron!  Thanks to Samantha B for the friendly service also.",

I know this is a seafood place but the Brussels sprouts are amazing.  I am literally craving them today.  The table then shared several apps, all tasty.  I then got the crab wedge salad for dinner and was very happy with nice lump crab, good flavors and veggies.  And then dessert.  Flourless chocolate cake.  Yum. We left stuffed and happy!",

Where else can you get a half lobster already cooked with all the sauces for $14 dollars? The staff behind the bar Are usually attentive to our needs. Atmosphere is great. Has a cozy almost house like feeling. Outdoor patio is very sweet. Only negative they have blown it with \"their label\" champagne and wines. Fox concepts does this also and they are always crappy tasting wines. I always say \"once the accountants get in and they always find ways of cutting costs\" I really hope they'll bring back some better champagnes and wines.",

    "text": "I love me some Buck & Rider. My boyfriend and I frequent this place, especially during happy hour because you can't beat their happy hour prices. We went in during fourth of July, and it was happy hour all day. Which means their lobsters, ceviche, and their delicious oysters were super affordable. I was never a fan of oysters especially because it had made me sick when I was little however this place made me an oyster fan (I think that says a lot!)   Sushi was just okay in my opinion but that's because I prefer authentic Japanese sushi and I am kind of a sushi snob. My boyfriend however loves the california roll with real crab. I love their deviled crab dip, can't go wrong with that one. I hated the spicy tuna tostadas. I couldn't even get my boyfriend to finish it (my boyfriend who would eat just about anything with tuna). It just was NOT good. Their calamari was okay, nothing special, but cooked perfectly, not too chewy. I was not a fan of their seafood gumbo.  Anyway, if you are an oyster fan, you will LOVE this place! I am getting hungry just by typing this review!",

The food: the clam chowder was \"spectacular,\" said my fellow diner. The voodoo fried rice and the diver scallops also were very good. But: happy hour oysters were only available at the bar, no bloody mary mix was available, they were out of lobster for the lobster rolls, and the North Shore and Evil Thai salads were a little too spicy. Service was pretty good, but even on the patio, it was almost too loud to have a normal conversation. Probably best to go there during the off season.",

For our entree we had the Pan Crisp French Loup de Mer which was superb. Our main entree did come out with a side of veggies that had pork mixed in which we couldn't eat, and Angelinea our waitress took it away immediately and replaced with with a new side right away! I would highly recommend asking for Angelinea as your waitress, she was very sweet and attentive. Overall we had a great experiance!",

I was super bummed to find out their pull apart dinner rolls are not available during lunch/brunch but thankfully the kitchen was kind enough to accommodate my request.    As on prior visits, the bar service came up lacking. The gentleman who was the main bartender had amazing skills in drink making but not so much on service and personability . My seafood tray sat empty in front of me for 25+ min before his trainee was thoughtful enough to remove it.  I was asked if I wanted a second glass of wine but never received it as he spent the rest of his time doting his regulars and telling them about his Halloween plans. I am glad someone got good service.",

Since I was alone, I opted to sit at the bar to people watch.   I tried the sun hallow and blue point oysters. They were fresh, but you can tell the person shucking them wasn't a pro. I also tried the mussels, which are a must try if you like mussels!   Normally, I don't have a sweet tooth, but I had to finish with some vanilla ice cream! They are very generous with the scoops and I couldn't finish. They were also giving away cookies when I left, but I was wayyyy too full to even take one!",

The place is hard to get into since the Camelback traffic during happy hour could be hectic.  Thank goodness for complimentary valet!    My friends and I sat at the Patio which only had happy hour drinks during that time.  Happy Hour food was only at the inside bar area; weird, but whatever!  I went for the \"Your Money or Your Life\"; bourbon, benedictine, combier and orange bitters; tasted like an Old Fashion to me.  As we sat we started with some appetizers.  I ordered their crab stuffed Hush Puppies.  Overall, it had the perfect amount of breading giving it a crunchy start while the stuffed crabs were soft to the bite and the sauce atop had a horseradish like minor sting.  Probably my favorite of the night.  For my entree I went for the Scallops; atop a bed of polenta, mushrooms, peas, pancetta, onions, and sun dried tomatoes.  The dish was beautifully plated!  The scallops were cooked to perfection, but overall I thought the dish lacked a punch to my palates.  Almost felt like all the ingredients were there for presentation purposes.    In the end, Buck & Rider is a cool place to hangout.  Drink specials are cheap during happy hour.  If you're definitely a seafood lover then this place is must try for you.  However, I just didn't feel like it was a fit for my taste buds - Enjoy!",

The fish was just so delicate, and there was none of that strong vinegar taste you often have with other ceviches.   I had seared scallops....it was a special of the day. And yes, scallops are on every menu these days, but I can never cook them well, so I treat myself. These scallops are a tasty, sweet, salty melt-a-palooza.

I'm not a fan - limited menu options, \"tricky\" tasting menus where the portions are smaller (but it does not say that on the menu), and harried staff.  This review is more about the service. I asked twice whether the sizes of the items in the restaurant menu were the same as the size if you ordered off menu. Both times (at host stand and at table), was told yes. Turns out that's not the case. The salad was a half portion, the meat was smaller, etc. When questioned about it, the server explained it away as being new. The food was overall pretty good, nothing exciting really, and if paid full price would have been fairly disappointed, but I think the deception of restaurant week bums me out the most.   In addition, we were seated 20 minutes after our reservation. Typically, a comp of Prosecco or something is given, but nobody really seemed to care. Oh well. Having been a \"mystery shopper\", I would say this place would benefit from one to learn customer service a touch better.  Positives - the ambience is very good.  Likely won't be back. YMMV",

Came back yesterday for Happy Hour and was not disappointed. I ordered one of each of the fresh oysters, 3 rocky point shrimp and a scallop. Everything was so fresh and prepared so nicely, I could have easily eaten an extra dozen of the oysters. We were still hungry and opted to try the tenderloin steak tartare, the tartare was beautifully seasoned and was accompanied with some nice toast and endive.

It use to come with rye toast it now comes  with a huge slaps of noble bread...it doesnt work. Pluss it was grisly  I could not eat it . Paid but it so sucked! The oysters always good shrimp as well....the ceviche could of used more shrimp. I love this resteraunt but tonight  disappointed. They only get stars for oysters and shrimp everything lacking. I actually was there for tartar. I only ate half couldnt eat more. It was horrible and it use to be my favorite place for it.  What cut if meat are they using now and didnt  expect  the huge pieces of bread. It did not pair well. I'm sorry I love this place but was so disappointed.  I want to add to the review, in response to the review they reached out. I appreciate this so I will change the stars for customer service. Stick with seafood bar and cooked seafood for sure streaks there food is great! Dont forget your cookie on the way out. I did change fro 3 to 5 for the fact they reached out.",

They have select appetizers for 9 bucks a piece and they also have discounted oysters too. Their cocktails are also 9 bucks on happy hour. You still walk away spending a good chunk of change but it's a lot nicer when you can save some money though. Our favorite appetizer is their steak tartare. It's super flavorful and it's presented nicely. They just never give you enough bread to go with it though. Their grilled bread that is served with the tartare is amazing. I also really liked the fried rice. Drinks are pretty good too. This place is expensive though so be prepared to drop some money and happy hour is usually really busy so expect to potentially wait to get a table or a spot at the bar.",

I was able to snag a seat at the bar and one of the bartenders asked if it is my first time dining here to which I answered, \"yes.\" She explains everything briefly yet efficiently, going over all of their normal specials in addition to the special July 4th deals. Very friendly and welcoming. Did not rush me into a drink order (which I hate, especially if I told you this is my first time here, and you have a decent specialty cocktail menu). Drink was delicious, the sushi rolls were ok, but the oysters were so fresh and delicious. Was presented with 4 sauce toppers and lemon. I wish I had stuck to just the oysters as I could have easily devoured 2 dozen. Next time I'm definitely trying more of their fresh seafood menu items. Oh, and get this, their happy hour is open to  7pm. How awesome is that?",

Nice selections of oysters,  seafood and steaks.  But you quickly notice that everything is overpriced.  Even the oysters are $21 for six.     Slight delay (and our indecision) in ordering, only to be told they were out of the smoked fish salad.  That info would have been helpful 15 minutes earlier.    So,  for these prices my choice would me Mastro's Ocean Club,  or the soon to open Ocean 44 at Fashionsquare just a couple miles east. At least with those places I expect the sticker shock.",

I started with the dungeness crab wedge and there was very little crab in it and the Louis dressing was bland. Two of us had the sea bass with the piri piri sauce and we both of us were underwhelmed, it was slightly dry and not flavorful. The server described the piri piri sauce as a very light lemon herbal sauce and it didn't appear to be what we got, it seemed to be more of a chopped tomato oil and herb sauce. I mentioned to the server how underwhelmed I was with the sea bass and she nodded and \"its a black sea bass\". Maybe she should have told us not to expect much of it when we ordered. Two others near me had sushi rolls both thought the sushi rolls were too salty. The side I chose was the vegetable of day, a cucumber salad which was probably the best thing I ate. The place is extremely noisy so much so that the server apologized for not being able to hear what we were ordering. Not once did anyone stop by the table to refill water glasses. I noticed toward the end of dinner a lot of the glasses were empty including mine.",

We started with crispy calamari (love the jalapenos in there) and a sushi roll with crab and macadamias. The rolls were bit bigger than bite sized (actually had to cut mine down) but flavors were great. Our entrees all lived up to their menu descriptions for flavor and freshness. Not sure I have the words to properly describe this intensely decadent chocolate cake we shared for dessert.   Service was very attentive. Pretty sure our server was training but she did pretty well with making recommendations from the menu. Atmosphere is very lively but casual.  Really liked their cocktail menu, but my one suggestion is that they add some Arizona beers and wines to their bar menu.   The sum total of our dining experience means we will be back for more.",

Next were the dollar each, once again, ultra fresh jumbo shrimp that were peel and eat.  Some in out party were not digging the peel part.   Next, the Brussel sprouts were, for me, the highlight of the night.  Not bitter as sprouts sometimes can be, they were prepared crisp and crunchy.  I wanted more.    The calamari was just ok and I would not order it again, as was the salmon, which was over cooked.

Everything that night was perfect, from the warm greeting we received by the host.  We were seated at a very quaint table, and our waitress Olivia made our night so nice with her knowledge of the menu, making recommendations, engaging in warm conversation...the best service we have had in a very long time.  The food was so fresh and tasty.  The bartender even came over to discuss whiskey options with my boyfriend.  Outstanding service, food/drink presentation, and flavors were SO good that we decided to go back 2 days later for brunch!!!  Olivia was there working (we were not at our table) and she saw us and came over to say hi.  Needless to say...we will be back here more often!",

    "text": "The food was ok, but  I will get to that later...   I enjoy cooking, so when I go out its for ambience and service, or Im with a friend/date, but thats not to say I don't go out often, because I do, perhaps more than I should. In this case, I was with a male friend who enjoys eating out as much as I do.  So, heres my deal.  We arrived on a monday afternoon and it happened to be happy hour.  Both of us have eaten extensively in our lives and not newbies to a dang menu.  The service we had was belittling. When our female server arrived, she was nice at first until we asked her \"whats going on here?\" (both of us looking at the happy hour menu.  This was a gesture to get her opinion and maybe guide us to whats fun, or how we should order.  SHE LOOKED AT US WITH THE UGLIEST RUDEST FACE then proceeded to run her finger over every word that she continued to literally speak out every word as if we could not read.  I had to look away outside because it was so off putting.. we ended up not eating off the regular menu because of this. instead we just said, ok give us 2 lobsters a dozen oysters, fried rice, ceviche and the tar tar.. which is basically everything off the happy hour menu minus a two items. I wanted to say to her so badly that she is so wrong as a server.  It was like she didn't want to describe anything to us, or give us any leads to what is good to her.  Service is why I won't be back",

    "text": "Blown away by Chef Wiener again.  My wife and I went out for our anniversary last night.  I heard that Chef W. had moved from Top of the Rock to Buck & Rider.  We'd enjoyed our last two anniversaries at TOR and were always impressed so we figured we'd try his new place.  We showed up and were immediately seated.  The place was buzzing, but not full-blown full...yet.  Our server, Shea, greeted us immediately.  Well, she was our main server, we were helped by no fewer than 6 separate people.  Their service was perfect, in my opinion.  They worked as a team but didn't \"over-serve\".  Shea was very engaging and helpful.  She spent considerable time explaining each treat that came out.  Our typical MO at places like this is to request a \"Chef's Choice\" dinner.  Not only does it give the chef a chance to show off, but we're invariably going to be treated to the items they're most proud of...it's going to be good.  Sure, you'll have favorites, and least favorites, but each item that shows up is going to be unique.  We never knew what was going to show up next.  Course after course, of \"off-the-menu\" items kept rolling in.  I wish I could remember the progression, or even every dish.  But we had oysters, hush puppies, a trout dish, some \"fried rice\" that also had quinoa in it, scallop civiche, a piece of tender swordfish with a crisp crust, crab cakes, a massive ribeye and some of the best lemon meringue pie I think I've ever had.  That meringue was so light and fluffy.  Anyway, a good hour and a half later we were stuffed!  I wanted to take a nap I was so content.  But unfortunately that behavior is frowned upon, so we took our leave.  By the time we were walking out we noticed that the place was PACKED!  There were a lot of people there but it never felt \"crowded\".  The dining room has a great flow to it, especially when the patio is open.  We got the bill and I was pleasantly surprised.  You'd think that an 8-course, chef's choice tasting dinner would break the bank.  I mean, it's an anniversary so you're supposed to splurge, whatever that means to you.  For us, we like to treat ourselves by visiting places where we know that the chef and his/her team are excited to be cooking for guests.  Yea, I love me some delivery pizza now and then, but I have no illusion that the person that made that pizza is as passionate about a dining experience as much as a professional, chef-lead kitchen.  This dining experience was WAY more valuable than the bill would have suggested.  In our opinion, this place is truly one of the most appealing dining experiences in the Valley.",

The drinks and wine were wonderful. I had the filet. Delicious and perfectly cooked. The steak sauce is incredible. My husband had the salmon. Equally delicious.  Other guests had the Sea bass, Burger and another wedge salad (because she didn't get enough during the appetizer course.) Everyone was happy.

They offer a complimentary valet parking, which is always nice to have.  They had (I think) 6 different oysters on the day I visited. I chose something from California (as she said it was the smallest piece) and something from eat coast. A half dozen each. I like small oysters, I think they just have better flavor to it.  I also shared grilled oysters (this was not on special, regular price). Nice texture and flavor, as much as I love raw oysters, grilled oysters have different taste to it and I like them both way.  Happy hour special wine really complimented oysters.  Glad I took a half day off on Friday to enjoy oysters and wine.  Great way to start my weekend in town.",

    "text": "This restaurant has very delicious food. Recently dined there and ordered 12 oysters (2 of each type) and two were missing. After we flagged our server down she went and got the two that were missing. All of them were very tasty! I do mention to people often that this restaurant has great oysters and seafood. For dinner I had the scallops and they were cooked well and very tasty. I had taken our server's recommendation on the sauce (romesco) and that was not the right choice since it tasted awful with the scallops so I used my date's lemon caper beurre blanc and it paired much nicer with it. The service is always mediocre there so 3/5 for service, 4/5 for food. Also, you really should get pinot grigio on the wine list. It usually goes really well with seafood.",

To start, we ordered the Miranda oysters. Briny and sweet, and very fresh tasting. Delicious! Our main course was the Faroe Island Salmon and scallops, both cooked to perfection. The salmon was moist and flaky, and the scallops were pan searing to perfection. Neither needed additional seasoning or the sauces provided because when you cook good food well, you don't need anything else. Fresh lemon and we both loved it.  The coleslaw is amazing. Desert was the lemon meringue pie. It's still one of the best deserts I've eaten.  So thank you, Buck & Rider for redeeming my faith in you. I've wanted you to be what you now are.",

I just hate how happy hour is always only in the bar area and not the surrounding tables - it gets me so mad! Why even have a Happy Hour!  Ordered a Diego Rivera cocktail to start off the night and was pleasantly surprised with this drink, it was fruitful for a tequila drink and highly recommend to y'all.  We started with a we Soup of the day which was a corn crab bisque, the soup had a smokey flavor and was tasty.  We felt we needed to try a sushi roll so we went with the Real crab California roll, which was good - nothing special. Other dishes we ordered was the Salt and Pepper crispy calamari, also just good.  The crispy Brussels Sprouts was most likely our best dish.  The goat cheese dipping sauce on the side added a different kick to these and were delicious!  Can't wait to return for another delicious meal!",

Is definitely not romantic or a place for a first date more for an after work party or meet up.  Really sad how front of house can take your review from a five star down to three.   Update:  I've decided to update my review to one star. I'm not sure how others feel about how they like to be treated as a customer. But I know that if you truly care about your customers then CARE. Don't be fake about it. It's insulting honestly. I was offered an \"ecomp\". In the email states our next meal is \"on us\". Great! Or at least for one meal. Considering our tab for this last experience was over $200. So I go to print out the \"ecomp\" per instructions\". It says up to $25. Ok I'm sorry. What meal is that there. How deceiving. That's less than the tip we left the waitress! Why would I want to come back and spend another $200 at my own 3 star rated restaurant?? Now one star.",

It was a weird crunchy and whatever the thai sauce was pungent and nasty. I won't be dipping anything in there anymore, I thought. As for dinner, I chose an IPA, the 12oz New York strip and the seasonal veggies. My sister ordered  the prime rib and loaded potato. I would've devoured that potato, but I'm trying to watch my carbs. Beer isn't a carb  haha! The ambiance is cool and our server was cute and attentive. She was very attentive even tho she seemed a bit rushed. My steak came out medium well instead of medium, but was still good. I didn't mind the noise because it was that , \"omg I'm finally off work and enjoying my beer!\" Chatter.   Other than the valet losing my keys for 15 minutes, I'd come back. This was a nice treat after a long day, but next time I'll try the oyster bar and the happy hour!",

Her service was impeccable, but her attitude and personality really shined through. I would come back just for her service and hospitality, but there's was so many other reasons to. I had one of the breakfast skillets, and finished every bite. My friend of course had to try the oysters, and couldn't stop raving about them... (and he's from the east coast). Overall the vibe is upscale, yet welcoming and comfortable. Probably the first of its kind. The drinks were delicious as well, I had the 'Ace in the hole'. Looking forward to coming back and trying more items from their menu and bar.",

    "text": "Great place, very fresh seafood, killer steaks, well-crafted specialty cocktails and quite nice wine list, albeit a little limited. I would have loved to see more diverse whites BTG, perhaps an Arizona malvasia bianca which would go nicely with a lot of their food. They have great hh too. Last night I enjoyed some sparkling rose-- my bf had a dunkel from Weihenstephaner-- with fresh delicious oysters (yes, it's safe to eat them in restaurants in months without an 'r'). Moved on to a delicious muscadet-- bf had craft cocktail 'Your Money or Your Life'-- with the classic LGO Caesar salad (sigh, it's SO delicious), then some pan seared scallops, ribeye, and HUGE loaded baked potatoes. Our server Sabrina was just delightful. She was so fun and knowledgeable, and despite the fact that we were her only table at one  point and it was nearly closing time, she never once made us feel rushed. She overheard my boyfriend say that he gave me a \"birthday bite\" of his steak (he hadn't told the restaurant it was my birthday--I know, big bday no-no) so just before dropping the check she brought out a HUGE slice of their housemade lemon meringue with a candle in it. We took 2 bites each and the rest home. FANTASTIC cocktail: 'Your Money or Your Life'-- bourbon based with a few other ingredients. Sadly I neglected to take a photo of the description but just ORDER IT.  Only criticisms: both the steak and scallops were *very* salty, though not so much that we couldn't eat them.  Next, if you want to experience a more leisurely meal, I'd recommend ordering things in stages or just letting them know you want it slowly paced (eg: \"we'd like to finish our oysters/crudo/calamari before our salads come out,\" etc). This restaurant seems to be good at fast ticket times, which can be great, but I had a feeling it would be quick-ish so I waited to order the salad until we finished our oysters; good thing as the salad literally came out within about 90 seconds. I then waited to order our entrees until my bf's salad plate was cleared (I'm a slow eater so I didn't make him wait any longer than that haha). Entrees arrived very quickly and perfectly prepared. Bf's steak was a PERFECT rare and my scallops were GORGEOUS, in appearance and flavor. Highly recommend B&R and if you don't know the explanation behind the name, don't Google it. Just go there and ask them-- it gives you another reason to go chow down on some really good food.",

The service was excellent and they worked as a team ensuring that we were well taken care of during the 90 minute lunch.  I ordered a bottle of wine, the fresh baked bread, salad and the ceviche for us to share.  This leisurely indulgence was in spring when the outdoor temperatures are mild and enjoyable.   Buck & Rider is often voted as the Best Happy Hour in Phoenix and I can see why.  The interior space blends seamlessly with the outdoor patio and the price point is on par for the ambience, location, culinary delectables and attentive service.  We love this gem of a spot in Arcadia and will return again soon.",

Anyway it was restaurant week so in addition to the 3 course meal we had a few oysters and scallops which were divine. From the 3 course ($44 per person)  the buck and rider oysters were sweet. The NY strip steak aged 25-35 days  and fish of the day (North Carolina Tatog with a crispy skin on and lemon buree blanc) were cooked perfectly. For the side we chose the farmer market vegetable (loved the thinly sliced beets and watermelon radish) and loaded baked potato. And the dessert was ice cream (we chose chocolate and pistachio) and the LGO salted chocolate chip cookie. A place to come back to again.",

    "text": "Buck and Rider is our new obsession; we've been back twice in three weeks already! A longtime fan of all of the LGO Hospitality restaurants, I've been meaning to check out B&R forever and was thrilled to finally get the opportunity to. The dude, an absolute seafood fiend with Baltimore roots, was a pretty easy sell. Our first visit was during AZ Restaurant week, aka the best two weeks out of the year to be in Arizona, and we were immediately hooked.   On our first visit we opted for cocktails. I had the Aunt Charlie, and the dude opted for the Your Money or Your Life. Mine was just a tiny bit sweeter than I normally like, but this was super tasty. His drink was also excellent, a well-made old fashioned with a nice hefty ice cube.   We have tried a handful of items on the menu. The guy swears by the oysters as the best and freshest he has had in the state of Arizona, and says they're even better than some that he's had in Portland. Claims they don't even need cocktail sauce or horseradish (coincidentally, they mix their horseradish into the cocktail sauce here, which he says is delish). The voodoo fried rice is also spectacular. The one app we weren't crazy about was the dixie picnic chicken snack, which I truly wanted to love based on the name alone. It wasn't all that crispy, and the breading felt like it needed a little extra oomph. But, we saw gluten free fried chicken on the menu and felt we needed to try it; also, the ranch was exponentially more dill-y than your standard, which I personally loved a lot.   I've mentioned the dude's seafood obsession, but the main thing that drew us here was the promise of gluten free crab cakes, which are maybe his favorite food in the entire world yet he can almost never have because he can't have gluten. These crab cakes did not disappoint in the slightest. They are huge meaty chunks of crab with great flavor, paired with an excellent mustard-based sauce. Truly spectacular. He opted for this as his entree on both of our visits, and I can't blame him in the slightest. I have had the ora king salmon, which was a market catch of the day--this can be prepared grilled or pan-seared, and with your choice of sauce and side. I went for pan-seared with lemon beurre blanc, and a side of the pea tendrils salad. The salmon was melt-in-your-mouth fantastic with a beautifully crisped exterior, and the sauce served as a nice pairing. The salad was also fresh and delicious. Our second go-around, I opted for the dungeness crab pasta. A San Francisco native, the dungeness crab was just calling out to me. The pasta was excellent, if not just the slightest bit oily. It was exceptionally tasty though, with a solid amount of crab topping the plate, and fresh asparagus and sun-dried tomatoes tossed in. Would definitely recommend, though I'd likely stick to the daily fresh fish in the future. Our dining companions had the burger and the lobster roll, and confirmed that both were excellent as well.   Service has been wonderful each time, and the space itself is great. It's a good size of dining room, with a spacious bar and little patio to boot. I was a little worried that it's right off of Camelback, but the complimentary valet makes things pretty smooth getting in and out. But the absolute best part, in my opinion? The famous LGO cookies on display on your way out the door. Possibly my favorite chocolate chip cookies in the universe, bite sized so you never feel too stuffed to still grab one!   We absolutely will be returning to Buck and Rider in the future, though it is just a bit too pricey to make it a regular stop for us.",

    "text": "First off, Buck & Rider has excellent service and an amazing menu. Before the experience I'm about to detail, I had only been one time for Happy Hour - and I was even impressed by that. My parents came to visit from Missouri and on the first night in town, my father suggested steak and my mother, per usual, requested some place that would have a nice steak for him and a great fish dish for her. Once we arrived, we had a short wait so we sat in the bar area and ordered a beverage. Once our table was ready, we were greeted with friendly service and ordered the calamari to start with (so good!).   Once our entrees arrived, we all started to dig in. Unfortunately, my boyfriend's steak was overdone. Now, I was a waitress in a steakhouse for several years so I made sure that the steak was out of \"okay\" range before sending it back. It was a busy night, and he is far from picky about his food, and the steak was expensive, so he sent it back for another. From then on, we were wowed.    The server was friendly and apologetic, while the rest of us continued to eat. (I shared my scallops with him while he waited, don't worry!) In the mean time, the manager visited our table, offered complimentary drinks and took care of the tab. He offered dessert (too full at that point) and invited us to come back with some bounce back coupons. We eat out frequently, and we are pretty easy-going. We never expressed a hint of anger or frustration about the steak situation: it happens; it's a risk you run when you order steak at a restaurant. However, the entire staff at B&R made the experience a million times better. We will definitely be returning, and I will recommend the place to everyone I meet. Amazing service, amazing food & cocktails. Don't forget a cookie on the way out!",

I asked if they had a candle or something we could blow out for a dessert...the response \"um no we dont. We keep getting asked if we do\" and a long pause. Um ok?   It was slow due to a holiday so the waitress was on our ass alllll night and not giving us a lot of time to chat at the table. She was super nice but hit the brake a bit hunny.   Now the food! The pull apart bread was AMAZING. So good that we got another order of it.  Friends got blue point oysters and said they were amazing! Calamari was on point as well! Im a steak guy so i ordered the NY steak. Very good and flavorful. It does come out cut which im not used to but it was fine. Very prime piece of meat - hardly any fat.  We got the chocolate cake for dessert. Very good but its extremely thick and not very moist (its really good though!)  Overall, the place is great. Looks good inside and the food was fantastic.  Wish they did reservations - it will come to bite them in the ass",

Decor definitely encourages you to linger and fresh oyster options pull in memories of Grand Central's Oyster Bar. Staff was attentive but the multiple staff leaves no one accountable for a drink refill.  I enjoyed the very cold steak tartare with exception; the presentation could be improved. Babe had the halibut and it was nicely done for his taste. Drinks were reasonable but the two namesake cocktails left me with regrets the next morn.   We are eager to try the remaining menu and welcome LGO's competition to the corner! (However I will be staying away from the Rittenhouse rye.)",

Atmosphere was pleasant, though entry area of the restaurant could've certainly been designed better. Not as bad as Yacht Club (now closed), but a bit awkward. The food was very good, prices were fair, so a re-visit will certainly be in order.  Update: Changing my rating from a 4 to 5-star. The B & R restaurant management really is focused on excellence.  Our full satisfaction is the only acceptable outcome to them, or they will fix it. I shouldn't have nitpicked on a Friday night (busy night already and we were a big party). Considering how many places there are to dine in Phx/Scottsdale that don't really seem to care, this place is jewel. Everybody down-to-earth and friendly as well. Every server was a pleasure. When I think now about value concept, it's impossible to NOT give them a fiver!",

The decore is upscale yet comfortable. Service was great. There was a team vibe with several people checking in on our table. I start by recommending the lobster roll \"Nik Niks\". I have had euphoric reactions to food before, but nothing like this. Something about the poached butterly lobster made me want to take my clothes off. (amazingly it wasn't the oysters). Yes of course we did have oysters. It was date night after all. They have a great selection of oysters updated on the board daily. We chose something smaller and on the sweet side because that's the way I like em. They were very fresh. The crab cakes were good, they didn't stand out much from what I've had before, but I did like the sauce and pepitas. The crab and macadamia roll was also a hit. The crab, asparagus, and macadamia nuts made my mouth happy with all the combined textures. And the Thai king crab salad was my second favorite item on the menu. It was light but packed with flavor and I've been craving it ever since. I'm telling you...euphoric lobster rolls and fresh oysters makes a winning combination for date night. Men take your ladies here! Date night will end very well for you I promise!",

Last night however,  really gave me an impression of the quality of this restaurant--if only they were all this way.  We were celebrating a birthday.  Orders included salmon (excellent!) whitefish of the day (excellent!), calamari (excellent!) and two orders of seafood gumbo --when the gumbo came--there was no doubt there was sausage but no seafood--we confirmed with wait staff that it was supposed to be seafood gumbo--she said yes --clearly the seafood part of the gumbo--didn't make it in the bowl--I made another comment to her --as i handed her my empty bowl--as the liquid part of the gumbo was very good--one of my eating companions had not finished hers--so there was clear evidence that the seafood had not made it to  the party.  The way the restaurant handled this really shows the quality of the management. The wait staff apologized and said she would let the kitchen know immediately--the manager came over shortly thereafter--apologized again and took the cost of both orders off the bill--In addition the dessert we had ordered was also comped.    In this day and age  with the level of rudeness and crassness that surrounds us everywhere--it was so nice to feel respected and that staff had the authority to make things right--Buck and Rider will continue to be on my go to list--because of this and of course the quality of the food.",

    "text": "Buck & Rider delivers seafood at its best with presentation and taste! I can't wait for an excuse to return; I mean, oysters are good for any occasion, right? I arrived on a busy Friday night where we were told there would be a wait by the courteous host who also stated to feel free to grab a drink at the bar while we waited. The bar is very well stocked with various liquors and libations and also doubles as a beautiful display of their oysters and other selfish fare. Before we had even gotten our drinks poured, our host came by to tell us that our table was ready, score!   We arrived to the table with our drinks and started perusing the appetizer menu and decided to start with the brussel sprouts, these were amazing but they are deep fried so I would not recommend them if you are looking for a nutrient-packed appetizer. In addition, we ordered the spicy tuna tostadas which were TO DIE FOR. They use the more traditional pickled carrots and peppers which really makes the flavors come together. What's rare about this place is the fact that you can order the oysters individually so our waitress recommended 2 different \"sweeter\" tasting types of oysters. Both types had the distinct oyster flavor but were amazingly palatable. I finished with the Blackened Redfish Veracruz and opted for extra sauce instead of the jasmine rice it is normally accompanied by. The sauce was a rich and hearty wonderfully spiced tomato sauce but the actual fish its self was pretty bland, perhaps just a characteristic of redfish, like tilapia? For dessert was the lemon meringue pie, which came highly recommended by our waitress. She mentioned to us that this is the precise thing she fantasizes about for her \"cheat days\" and it did not disappoint! Tart and tangy and a delicious cinnamon graham cracker crust to lust over.  The service here was excellent across the board from the host staff, bartender, and waitress and quick although the restaurant was buzzingly busy. I always appreciate a server who takes time to chat and make recommendations and has a vast knowledge of the menu. (Thanks Ariana!) Great place to bring a large party as they only make reservations for parties of 6 or larger, but take your date here and they will surely not be disappointed! The total bill at the end of the meal was $87 and this was for 2 mixed drinks, 2 appetizers, oysters, an entree, and dessert! Quite reasonable for the quality of the food, service, and total experience of the place. I highly recommend Buck & Rider and suggest you do not miss out on the seafood portions of the menu!",

Once again, I hosted coworkers, a party of 6. Knowing they don't take reservations, we arrived early for what we expected to be a busy Friday night. They took us right to our table this time without the entire party on site.I took our hostess aside to give her the note from the manager and she knew who I was! Our last visit was in December. She promised us a great evening. Off to a great start. We enjoyed a couple of happy hour beverages while wearied for our guests.  This experience was much different -- our server, Angie, was very warm, on top of our needs, helpful, gracious -- all thing things I'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Although she mentioned that they used a team approach to service, I think she as the only one to work our table all night. Great job all evening, Angie,  The dining room is still pretty noisy but not nearly as loud as last time. One of my guests LOVES oysters and raved about the selection, freshness and flavor. We also got shrimp (knowing this time to order the count we wanted), calamari, and the dinner rolls.  For dinner, we had the loup de mer, halibut, chicken, fish Veracruz, salmon -- we ran the gamut of the menu! Everyone was so happy with their selections. The seafood is so fresh and flavorful. Our non-adventurous eater liked the chicken very much. Angie recommended the Sancerre white and we also got a bottle of the black chicken for the red drinkers. Everyone was too full for dessert but we lingered, laughed and never felt rushed.   While I'm sure they gave us a little extra attention because of our previous experience, I am still very impressed all the way around. Thank you for a very nice dinner and evening, Buck & Rider.",

The selections in each category are just \"different\" enough to pique your interest but not require a food dictionary to decode.   I have but one regret: I did not bring enough friends to justify ordering One Of Everything!  Smoked Trout Salad was excellent with nice flavors, textures and visual presentation.  The dressing complemented it without taking over.  The Crab Dip was GREAT but next time I will skip the gluten free crackers (have a new appreciation for why some people people in my life who eat gluten free are so cranky - their food choices are weird!!! that would make me cranky too...). Coming back soon with reinforcements - this is PATIO season and should be enjoyed in charming locations like Buck & Rider.",

If it's a beautiful evening, you should sit on the patio. This is a must try seafood house!",

The ambiance is very pleasant and wait staff friendly. The kitchen was hardly taxed from the sparseness of the crowd, yet it was quite a long time between ordering and delivery of our food.

We also loved the mini lobster roll. It was executed as well as any Michelin restaurant.  Also loved the cocktail program, the flavors were well balanced and unexpected.  The Aunt Charlie with its mix of tea and honey lemon is a must. LGO has something really special here!   It seems they've managed to bring the feel of a really good coastal restaurant to the middle of the desert. Can't wait to go back!",

We started with the calamari, which is now one of my favorites. It doesn't have the traditional marinara dipping sauce but instead a tangy vinaigrette which I. My opinion is so much better. Then we got the mussels!! These are sooo good the flavor is amazing - also come with a tasty piece of corn bread! Lastly, we had the real California roll with kale salad! This this was huge but so good with the real crab! Kale salad was perfect!   Second experience: came here with my boyfriend for my birthday.  We came in Sunday and Sunday's they have 1/2 bottles of wine!! Yes please! For food started with the he amazing calamari again then the clams ( they changed the mussels out) theses weren't my favorite- flavor was blah and the clams wee very small.  The bread was also burnt black. That's the best part is the bread and sauce. ( I did ask for new bread and they forgot and ended up giving us a gift card because they felt so bad on my birthday- so unexpected but so awesome). My boyfriend got the chicken which everyone knows you don't order chicken at a restaurant because that's lame - and he regretted it. Super generic much better options on the menu. Lastly we had the lemon pie - oh my fluffy lemony yum!!! We crushed this.  All in all awesome experience both times will definitely be back!  Oh and don't forget on your way out to grab the little sea salt chocolate cookies that they have from LGO! Those things are gold!",

I had the B&R Filet, with a celery root puree and haricot vert. Was not awed, the filet quality was fine, more rare than what I ordered, medium rare, and simply had no flavor. I did have a bite of the Hong Kong Style Halibut and it was absolutely delectable! Would definitely get that the second time around.

Buck & Rider is an amazing addition from LGO and the seafood go to in PHX!!   I would have to say this is by far my favorite restaurant decor in the LGO family. The inside has a cool feel to it, I guess it was conceptualized after a house in Australia. High ceilings and lighting that ranges from an old chandelier to trees with small white lights. Either way this is the perfect place for that intimate date night with your significant other!! Now the food will help you there too with your lady! Nik Niks will get you Nik Niks they say, well at least that's what I say!!  This was our second time here and what brought us back was those little Nik Niks! We decided to go for a few different starters. We went with the crab dip: rich crab dip with a little spice which I believe was jalapeno. This cheesy dip goes perfect with the gluten free (not sure why) crackers with watermelon radish. We also got the Thai King Crab Salad: Okay, I swear the dressing is the same as the LGO Thai Chicken Salad. The Crab Salad was unreal good. Really surprised it worked so well with the Mango. Now the Nik Niks: These little buttery beauties are like oysters. Not sure exactly what's in these, but if Pfizer ever got their hands on these they may have the viagra for woman. Now food has never gotten me hot and bothered, but that's alright, I just need my lady that way!!! Haha. Order the Nik Niks!  Buck and Rider has a great selection of wines and full bar to fit any of your boozing needs!! If you leave here and your lady isn't ready to go home with you I would suggest taking your girlfriend somewhere cheaper or finding a foodie girl!! Buck & Rider / Fuck n Right on",

Steak 44 was a little too busy and we wanted something a little quieter. I have a seafood allergy so stayed away from the food, but the drinks were fantastic.  Their drinks remind me of the cocktails I like to order at The Windsor. We were there late and I've read reviews about their reverse happy hour but the bartender didn't mention it and our drinks were full price. Regardless, we will be back. The experience was great.",

    "text": "Had to change my review and drop a star because of our most recent experience at Buck & Rider. We have been loyal customers for a while now and never had a problem until this past Saturday. We went for brunch and instead of the usual bottomless mimosas we opted for the bloody mary since the server pointed out that it was on happy hour. The price on the regular menu was $10 and she said it was lower than that. She also mentioned the oysters were half price so we ordered a half a dozen. Not only were we terribly dissapointed in the quality of the bloody mary mix, we were charged full price for them and all the oysters. It was a shame that we received False information and paid $10 for a bloody mary that was so generic. Carly's Bloody Mary is almost half the price and 100% better. You can taste the in-house made bloody mary mix there. We will still return to Buck & Rider because their food is great, but we will absolutely be more careful with what we order in regards to the happy hour menu. And stay away from the bloody mary.",

The ladies at the bar that gave us their spot said they weren't impressed my the menu either and left to go to Chelsea's Kitchen. We did order the crab dip that did taste very fresh. But it was kinda dry and the crackers they serve them with were so gross and crumbly. My friend said the oysters were lovely. The kettle dirty martini was only $12, so I was happy with the price but not happy it was SO watered down. We were wondering why it looked so full, then tasted it and it was definitely half water. The bartender was busy but friendly and the ambiance was cheery but the whole room seemed very dark. I guess no happy hour yet. We left and had dinner at LGO so we still all in the fam. I will go back to try the oysters and will ask for a better martini",

We still wanted to try it out, and we decided to wait for a table. After being seated we found out they don't offer food on their happy hour, just drinks. So we ordered a few things off of the regular menu to try out.   We started with oysters and the cornbread. The oysters were great, fresh, clean, and tasted very nice. I would definitely get oysters here again. The cornbread was also amazing. We really enjoyed it. We had high expectations after these appetizers and decided to order the lobster rolls and the trout to share. This is were our excitement died. The lobster rolls had stale bread and were fishy as well as being doused in mayo. I don't think someone could pay me to eat these again. As well, the trout was in a very heavy crust, ruining the flavor of the trout. I would not get this again either. What made these meals more disappointing was the fact that their prices are extremely high. This would be fine if it was amazing, but it wasn't and that's a problem.   This place seems really good for oysters and drinks, but I would not come here for a full dinner. Too many better options nearby.",

I can whole heartedly say that I will be coming back on a regular basis. Everything tasted SO fresh and clean. Nothing was too over powered by the sides or sauces, you were able to actually thoroughly enjoy and   taste the difference compared to most fish places who say they are \"fresh\" but you can clearly taste a gross fishy taste. Also I have to give them probs to their drink names, \"Hit the road Jack\" was so refreshing and besides I enjoyed ordering each drink because of the fun creative name! Must try, phoenix. B&R won't let you down. ALSO THEIR MERINGUE PIE IS DELICIOUS to end the night.",

The new building is beautiful and it was BUSY. We were seated immediately though and had a great waitress. The menu is reasonable with the amount of selections and everything looked so good!  The sushi looked beatiful when it came out and we will have to try it at some point, but we didn't want our first experience to be with that. We went for the tuna tostadas and the pull apart bread. The tostada was amazing! The fish was fresh and just slightly grilled but pretty and pink on the inside. It actually had a good kick to it! They had corn and some other yummy items and flavors mixed in. The table next to us had the pull apart bread and it just looked too good, we had to get it. It seems silly to want to order a basic item like bread, but it was the most amazing bread...like ever! It is salty and buttery and perfect because we used it to sop up the remaining stuff from the tostada.   This is definitely on the pricier side, but for the quality of seafood you are getting, it is so worth it. It is flown in daily and they actually get it from the same place the Plaza gets it apparently. Really well done and a great new place in Arcadia!",

The lobster roll was also shockingly good because I didn't know what to expect from a seafood roll with mango, but it added a nice texture. The pasta I got was yummy and acidic from the tomatoes but much too greasy! My boyfriend got the breaded sea bass, which was good too but overpriced. It came out looking like the tilapia filets you can get at Costco (super small!). The butter sauce was amazing though.  We ordered the flourless chocolate cake with vanilla gelato for dessert and even though we did expect it to be rich, it was hellaaaa thicc. It was like a truffle and difficult to eat, but the chocolate was bittersweet, just the way I like it.  The restaurant itself was packed and bustling, so it had a very comfortable ambience. It was just a little cold because we were sitting under a ceiling fan. The host was super friendly and valet is complimentary!",

Unsure of what to order during midday, I asked the chef and was recommended the Radio Milano Pasta Troife and a small order of the Savage Blonde oysters. Done and done! I also snagged myself a glass of Aunt Charlie while I waited and did a bit of people watching. The drink was very strong even though it was on happy hour, which was stellar. Speaking of things that are out of this world: oysters. You must get them. Just do yourself a favor. I mean, they're half off at happy hour, so why wouldn't you? Crisp and delicious toppings that only enhance the natural flavor.  When my Radio Milano showed up, the server warned me the plate was still warm. Oh yeah definitely, I gotcha. No touching. I'm no dummy. So I stir up my pasta, blow on it a bit, and promptly burn my tongue. I literally did this no less than three more times because it tasted so freaking good that I couldn't care that I was losing feeling in my taste buds. Guys, I learned I'm a real dummy that day. Learn from my mistakes.   I can't wait to come back here and get brunch on the patio. The seafood is so incredibly fresh and everything was delicious. I'd say this is a fabulous place to impress your fish lovin' date.... either at night or the morning after.",

    "text": "I was in town in Phoenix again for work and we were recommended to come to Buck & Rider for dinner. I checked out the menu and once I realized it was another LGO Hospitality location I knew for sure that it would be a great dining experience.  I frequent the other locations (Chelsea's Kitchen in Sky Harbor and in Pasadena, CA where I'm from) and I was very excited to try another concept of theirs.  We ordered many appetizers as always.  We got oysters, the crispy brussel sprouts, and steak tartare.  The Dixie Picnic Chicken Snack was a very pleasant surprise which was essentially chicken tenders but seasoned and cooked to perfection.  For my entree, I really wanted to get a steak but as you could probably guess I was full from the appetizers.  So I ended up getting the Radio Milano Pasta Troife which was amazing.  It had a great spicy kick to it as well.  Anna our waitress said it would be nothing like I have ever tasted and she was right.  The portion was perfect considering I wasn't hungry after all the great appetizers.  The desserts were amazing, I didn't get to see the menu so I don't know the name but the meringue pie that was brought over was delicious.  I'm not normally a huge fan of meringue pies but it wasn't too tart and the crust gave it a great texture in each bite.  We came in a pretty large group and it seemed like everybody had a great time.  Thank you for the staff that helped us out, they were very attentive and proactive.  I hope we come back next time so we can try the other items on the menu.  There was too much I missed out on.  And of course, don't forget the cookies at the front!",

She was a great server but the experience was sub par. We waited forever to pay our tab and get our tab as well as our drinks earlier in the night... everything but the food just took forever.... when we got the bill I couldn't put server to ask questions after she came back once so I asked the manager and even though my math was right I was told I was wrong..... that makes no sense in my mind. I did the math and it didn't add up to the total I was given by over $20 I just feel a little taken advantage of for sub par oysters. The food was blah and the service was good other that the things taking a little to long.",

Their Happy Hour includes 1/2 off the bar menu eats {this includes their raw bar!} and $6 cocktails and wine. They don't have a freezer on site an their seafood is flown in fresh daily. Seafood lovers - get here now!!  Their cocktails are amazing and have the most unique names! I always order One Night in Babylon because I love anything with gin + cucumber. It is so refreshing and I warn you, you'll suck this one down without even realizing it! I have to consciously 'sip' it!   For eats - we ordered their whole lobster from the raw bar - you guys, this too is half off!!!! Next, we ordered oysters, steak tartare {the best i've ever had in my life}, and the baja style seafood cocktail that has scallops, fresh crab, and shrimp! Holy heaven, the seafood cocktail is also the best i've ever had.   I honestly think that Buck & Rider is one of my favorite places in the Valley. They never disappoint and the Happy Hour really can't be beat for the quality and freshness of their food. See ya again soon! :)",

We've dined there several times in the past and never disappointed.  $31 for my salmon that included a choice of side (I picked the stuffed baked potato) might have seemed a couple dollars too high but not complaining as everything my wife and I ordered was great.

Their happy hour is perfect and includes food and some of the specialty cocktails, and you definitely can't beat Sunday brunch and bottomless mimosas -- you can even stick around until it turns into Sushi Sunday with half price sushi! Definitely recommend this place even if you are not a seafood lover.

I would probably describe it as upscale casual if talking to friends. Go on in and get drinks from Annie, I'll probably already be at the bar.",

We started out with crispy hash browns as an appetizer and it was well done with the sauce provided.  Entrees by our friends were the redfish and crab cakes.  My wife and shared the crab cakes and the scallops.  To be honest these two items never seem to have a great flavor but both entrees we shared we were well prepared and had some zip as a result of a sauce on the crab cakes and a seasoning on the scallops.  Friends were pleased with their's as well.  The lemon meringue pie was extraordinary.  Only two complaints.  First the waitress seemed overwhelmed and struggled to be timely with our requests.  Secondly, it was a windy dusty day in Phoenix but we sat on the patio anyway.  The glass table countertops should have been wiped off and you could literally write your name in the dust on the table top.  Very disappointing.

Out waitress informed us upon arrival that all of their seafood is flown in daily and it is never frozen and you could tell. The halibut was seasoned perfectly with a crispy panko crust. The micro-green mixture served with it was great as well, it was crispy not soggy. The price point was high but that is to be expected from something that was on a plane hours before hitting my plate. The atmosphere was great we sat on the back patio. I hope to see some type of live music there in the future.",

We sat in the bar for happy hour and the drinks are a great deal. HH is from 11-7 Monday thru Friday. We also ordered the snapper ceviche and spicy tuna roll off the HH Menu. The ceviche was super fresh and the roll was one of my favorite things. We also tried the calamari which was fine but didn't blow me away. My husband got the ny strip which was definitely Overpriced for what he got. I got the ahi tuna burger and loved it. I would definitely go back for more sushi or the ahi burger. They have a Sunday night sushi and wine special that I want to try. Overall I would probably go back but only when I don't mind spending more for a special occasion or with out of town company.",

    "text": "LGO has a recipe for food and atmosphere that works really well for me. Four of us decided to check out B&R Sunday evening and were not disappointed. We started with oysters and the lobster/macadamia roll. Oysters- not my thing but was assured they were fresh and creamy. The roll was nicely prepared, not overly large so that it's difficult to wedge in your mouth (ugh), and the ponzu sauce was light and slightly citrusy.   Two of us ordered the Thai Style Lobster Salad. It was a decent size, came with napa cabbage, cilantro, chunks of lobster, peanuts and a spicy vinaigrette. This was okay but did not knock my socks off. I would consider ordering it again but would definitely consider other options.  The crab cakes- now those have my vote! There were two large crab cakes chock full of crab, not fillers. They came with a nice side salad and were delicious. Definitely order these!  Another person in our group had the white fish of the day, in this case loup de mer. It was nicely prepared with a light breading, browned and served with well prepared broccolini.  We finished off with dessert, banana cream pie and lemon meringue. Now I love homemade banana cream pie. It takes me right back to grandma's. This is really a cream pie with bananas served on the side in a graham crust. Sigh. I need the bananas in the pie... and I like crust. It was okay, just not my style. The lemon meringue, however, surprised me. It is served in a graham pecan crust (with a hint of cinnamon?) and the lemon is more of a curd, very creamy, very tart. The meringue is more of a marshmallow than a traditional meringue. Normally meringue and marshmallow don't score very high with me, but I would have to make an exception for this.   We were all very satisfied with our experience and the food. Four out of four said they would be back!",

It was delayed a couple minutes and came after everyone else got their drinks and the bar manager comped them.  Now that's service!  Oysters are always delish. I got crab cakes that were fabulous as well.  Brussels spouts are a must if you go there.  So good.  My girlfriend got a filet that was cooked to perfection and oh so tender.  Pull apart rolls are just silly good.  It was my birthday so I got a desert. Lemon meringue pie...wow...I'm a bit of a pie snob but this stuff was epic.",

Words cannot even describe how fresh they tasted! I then went with the ceviche which was so fresh. I honestly couldn't believe how fresh the fish tasted!

    "text": "My husband and I went to Buck & Rider for the first time for our joint birthday dinner on Saturday night at 6pm.  The Pros:  Service was friendly, prompt and attentive from the several servers who came to our table.  Our martinis were icy cold and just the way we like them.  The seafood selections were plentiful; I've never seen a combined platter of chilled shellfish at other Valley restaurants (see picture below).  The seafood was very fresh and the taste was excellent.  The platter was served with three sauces - mignonette, pomeroy mustard (sort of a mild mustardy mayo sauce) and an eye-poppingly horseradishy cocktail sauce, all of which were delicious.  The Cons:  At 6pm on Saturday the bar was jammed and deafeningly loud.  Although the dining room was not yet full, the sound from the bar carried into the dining area and made it difficult to talk. (The restaurant is approximately half bar and half dining area, although they have a nice patio which would probably be best if you want a lower noise level.)  They were out of bread for 30 minutes (at 6pm on a Saturday?) and when it finally arrived, it was soft dinner rolls brushed with butter and sprinkled with salt.  They were warm and soft, but I would have preferred crusty artisan bread.  I can get squishy dinner rolls by the dozen at the grocery store.  And finally, the prices are steep.  The dinner rolls cost $9, crab cakes were $34, our seafood platter (with an extra half lobster) was $98, individual oysters are $3.50.  They have happy hour every day until 7pm but oysters aren't discounted; Little Cleo's has happy hour during the week where oysters are $1 apiece.  The Verdict:  We enjoyed our dinner very much and would go back for a special occasion, but not on a regular basis.",

I love the location and the views of Camelback Mtn from inside the restaurant. I'm not the biggest expert on eating seafood and the bartenders were great in giving me the lowdown  on how it all works. They had some great specials for their one year. I started off with one of their signature drinks - \"your money or your life\" (one of my favs over at LGO). Then my buddy and I split some oysters that were half off for the day. The oysters came with some choice toppings and went down smooth. Stone crab was in season and I snagged a claw for my first time. Despite being in the desert, these guys pride themselves on serving the freshest seafood that is flown in daily. We ended our day with a couple more drinks and the halibut ceviche that was nice and light and delicious. The manger checked on us and a couple servers greeted us as well. The customer service was definitely on display for their anniversary. They are building an outdoor patio bar that should create a fun outdoor dining experience. I have nothing but good things to say about this place and I'm still savoring that salted chocolate chip cookie they handed me as a walked out the door. Keep up the good work!",

My boyfriend's boss was in town for business so we decided to take him here with us for a fun dinner/drinks evening. We got a taste for two different entrees, two desserts (which, OF COURSE were shared family-style), and three drinks.   ATMOSPHERE: Upon entry, you'll notice that the floor plan is really open and roomy... And that there are freshly baked cookies for consumption. There is a table right between the bar and entrance where you can wait for your drink & appetizer order to be taken- which will then be brought to you before you're even seated at your table! This has become a trend in some of the newer restaurants in the area, which I absolutely love because there is nothing worse than standing around bored out of your mind waiting for a table to open up. It gives you and your dinner date/guest an opportunity to chat- and makes you forget all about the wait time! The bar actually doubles as a shellfish display, which was a nice little touch. Speaking of wait time: our reservation was originally for 7:30PM, however we arrived an hour earlier and they still accommodated us and had us seated way before our initial reservation time! There is also outdoor seating available, but probably scarce because the weather has been so nice lately.   APPETIZERS: We split three kinds of oysters with chilled shrimp, there weren't any oysters that I disliked! You could definitely tell that they were fresh- and they were not drained of their liquor (biggest pet peeve when you receive dry oysters- if an individual wants to drain their oyster, they can do so when it arrives at their table).  ENTREES: We went with the 8 oz center cut filet mignon and BBQ Pork Ribs for our entrees. No, we did not order anymore seafood, which I deeply regret now because everything was just SO GOOD, I can only imagine how great their seafood main dishes must be. The center cut filet was cooked to a medium rare- exceptional. Perfectly prepared, not to mention the wonderful smoky flavor and melt in your mouth quality of meat. When I tried to pick up the ribs, they fell apart immediately, CLEAN off of the bone so I guess you can say that they were cooked perfectly as well! Amazing flavor there too, complete with a kick of spice.  As a side for my ribs, I decided to order the fries (which was the only thing I did not like, as they were all too crispy.. but some people love crispy fries).  DRINKS: I was dressed in OTK boots, a mini skirt and a long sleeve shirt so I definitely had my sassy streak going on and decided that the best fitting preliminary drink for me would have been a glass of Rose. I ordered the Argyle Brut Rose which didn't disappoint (to say the least). I absolutely loved it and savored this through our oyster rounds. For our main entree(s), we shared a glass of the Absent Minded Professor, which paired really well with the filet.   DESSERT:  To finish our meal, we ordered a slice of lemon meringue pie and pumpkin pie. Both were great, it was my first time actually ever trying lemon meringue pie- it was very refreshing and the meringue was perfectly bruleed- giving the final after taste of charred sweetness.   Needless to say, I am definitely coming back and ordering a whole bottle of that Argyle Rose and  trying the seafood entrees!   -Outdoor seating available  -Happy Hour  -Great date night spot -Trendy",

    "text": "I've been here twice in the past 2 weeks so that should tell ya that I like the food. There are hundreds of reviews raving about the freshness of the seafood and it's all True! Especially the oyster bar selection, it's amazing! Wish, I could rate this place 5 stars but honestly on both occasions the service was subpar. On both occasions, when I walked in with my guest the host table was an obvious source of confusion. There needs to be host at the front at all times, instead it's just whoever is paying attention seats you. I shouldn't have to be asked \"have you been helped\" multiple times. Secondly, once seated both times the waitresses seemed aloof and it wasn't even busy. I shouldn't have to ask someone who isn't my server for a drink. I'll be back again but seriously for as much as this place is the service needs to be tightened.",

The manager we spoke with and the GM went above and beyond to fix our issues and insure we had a good experience the next time we stopped in, which we definitely appreciated.  Buck & Rider has some of the best fresh seafood selection in the Valley, with a variety of raw oyster options, fantastic lobster and shrimp, and an interesting craft cocktail menu. The Buck and Rider and Your Money or Your Life (if you are a whiskey fan) are strong favorites. The fried chicken is also amazing, we ordered a second basket because we loved it so much.  We also are a fan because B&R has one of the better post-work happy hour deals going. Historically, Geisha has been a standard for our group of friends because their HH lasts until 7 for those of us that work longer days, and because they have both food AND drink specials in a fun and trendy environment.  Well, Buck & Rider can boast the same or better!  Will definitely be back.",

There was barely enough room for our adorable server to slide between tables. Seriously. But, that being said, I soon got over the fact that I could see the whites of the total stranger's eyes right next to my head because of the awesome service, drinks, and food. This place hit it out of the park! Because we were so crammed in to the busy bar, we decided to just do a bunch of appetizers and drinks. We had the salt and pepper calamari with a thai sauce, which had a nice mix of both tentacles and rings. The crispy brussels sprouts were interesting with the goat cheese dipping sauce, but a little heavy on the gastrique. Still a hit. We enjoyed three VERY fresh sushi rolls with great unique sauces, and then some pretty tasty oysters...especially for Phoenix, not exactly the smartest choice in the desert! Oh, and the PEI mussels. I am PICKY about my mussels, and these were perfect. To drink, I had the \"One Night in Babylon\"...twice...STILL want other night! This had upscale gin, cucumber, lime, za'atar...yes...Indian spice. Sooo fresh and unique. Our server talked me into it, I was skeptical. She won. Also had a drink with tequila, coconut water, green tea, ginger. It was also unique and refreshing, but not as tasty as the other. I was very happy I was not the designated driver this night! Then, we finished with the BEST lemon meringue pie I have EVER had. I hate meringue, but this was perfect with a very tangy, yet sweet enough lemon filling and a crust my dear grandmother would have been jealous of! DEFINITELY going back again to have a full on dinner, with a reservation...on this particular hostess' night off! Valet parking was very prompt and courteous. Great experience. Will enjoy taking out of town friends here as well.",

And they have NOT disappointed me! First off, the service is fantastic. The food is even better. Always fresh, always on point. If you're coming here for your first time, or even if you have been here and not tried this... The Lobster Roll \"Nik Niks\" are where it's at. Do yourself a favor and get an order, (if you're with more than one other person, get two because you'll for sure want your own.) The Radio Milano Pasta Troife is probably one of my favorite dishes and it's perfect for sharing. I will say that their seafood is probably the freshest in the area. Never frozen, always amazing.   Now as for the staff- they make you feel like you are just coming to see an old friend and they never leave you hanging!   The ONLY thing that I find odd is that I have to pay more for the \"pull-a-part dinner rolls\" than I do for my happy hour cocktail. Which just says that their happy hour is just as good as their dinner rolls.   Other than that, they're killing it over their. Keep up the good work Buck & Rider! Don't forget to take a cookie at the door!!",

The raw bar happy hour is only served in the bar area so it fills up quickly. Jonathan reserved a table for us until we got there within 15 minutes. He did not realize how much it meant to us for him to accommodate our request. This dinner was a special one since this would be the first time she has visited AZ without our dad. He passed a few months ago and he loved oysters so this was a tribute dinner to him. Miss and love you! Our waitress Cassandra, was very attentive, patient, and accommodating. She explained every dish we had a question about, which was 100. We ordered the blue point oysters, seafood gumbo, trout, Brussels sprouts, king crab legs, crab dip, jumbo shrimp, and lobster. Everything we ordered was amazing, we will definitely be back!",

Upon entering the restaurant, you'll see their raw bar (stone crabs, alaskan king, oysters) all looking fresh and delightful. I opted to try the spicy tuna roll, good serving size with plenty of tuna inside. My husband got the fried calamari which comes with a thai dipping sauce. Both were delicious. I got the miso glazed salmon, cooked to perfection but I wish it came with a milder flavored side as the pine nuts overpowered the salmon. My husband was happy with his Loup De Mer fish sandwich served with coleslaw. Don't expect a crispy fish fillet, it's pan fried. We ended our meal with Pistachio gelato. All in all, happy with the quality of the food and service and will surely come back to try their dinner menu. I'm eyeing the lobster roll.",

    "text": "We've been wanting to try Buck and Rider for quite awhile.  Finally!  We went for Happy Hour and they have a great menu of items.  Its more of a fresh seafood restaurant than burgers and chicken.   The restaurant from the outside appears to be small however upon entering, its larger than it looks.  The decor is fab...the ambience and energy is great.  Its a total conversation place meaning you go for lively conversation and not for the sports bar feel.  A very warm and inviting atmosphere.  To start, aside for the Ballast Longfin beer, we had the special of Oyster Rockefeller which were fabulously savory! A great start!  That should be part of their menu or maybe ask for it off menu. I ordered the pan roasted mussels.  It has chorizo, white wine with grilled sourdough bread. Now with shellfish, you have to be mindful of pieces of shell and sand.  None of oysters had it but some of the oysters had several shell pieces that made its way into my mouth.  A little disconcerting.   If my memory serves me correctly, I believe that shellfish are more in season in months that end in \"R\"...that may explain for the size of the mussels.   They were pretty small yet plentiful, but quite a bit of work for the meat .  The chorizo did not add any particular flavor to this dish and probably would be a little better  presentation if it the chorizo was shaved or sliced on a bias instead of diced; the diced pieces didn't fit into the mussels so it was difficult to eat both the mussel and chorizo simultaneously.  The diced look made the dish look more like corned beef hash than a premiere player on the menu.  The mussel broth and the grilled sourdough bread was outstanding although it would be nice if the slices of bread were either thicker or additional slices offered.  There's nothing like having to sop up something so deliciously rich with that bread.  I was afraid to ask for additional slices since I thought by time I got the additional  sourdough bread the broth would have been too cold.  My wife had the half lobster and she seemed to enjoy that very much especially for the price, it appeared to be well worth it.  The overall experience rates a 4 primarily for the great decor, layout, energy and fantastic environment, the meal that I had may need some slight upgrades.  We will return to try other dishes.",

I would like to say I ate it and it was just so so.  But that is not at all what happened.  One taste of the soup and it was so bitter that I could not take a second.  Next the salad.  Watery lettuce, tasteless crab and tart mango all topped with a spicy dressing that was inedible. Tried to get a different dressing, vegetable oil based dressing. This was oil with veggies cut up in it.  Horrible.  No flavor. At this point I gave up.  My reservation was for 6:15 and I was out by 6:25.  Never will return.  The staff was polite and responsive.  Best part of the experience.",

One of THEE best happy hours going...fair warning the Friday HH crowd is ruthless...as only the bar area is HH zone...bar stools are watched like Trump wished the border was...leave a seat and it's fair game...two to three deep is not uncommon..once however you have a golden ticket...enjoy. The seafood is unpretentious and amazing. Shockingly the brussel(?) sprouts are simply amazing. The service is great, they know they get their ass kicked during HH and do it with a smile. The vibe can get a little 'sea marketish' (see what I did there?)  as you do get some spillover douchbaggery; if that is your thing..great..if not, people can ignore the overtures of amazingness from such individuals.  The cocktails are also HH, which makes them taste all the more better...the best on the menu is YOUR MONEY or YOUR LIFE..a version of an old fashion w/Old Forrester bourbon..you just can't go wrong at this place.",

The service, from the time we walked in till the time we left, was phenomenal.  And the food?  I need to create a new word for that because no superlative will do it justice.  The absolute freshest, most delicious seafood this desert dweller has ever had!!  We started with a round of raw oysters, ordering 6 each of three different types, and each was delicious, with its own unique flavor and texture.  The accoutrements provided with were fresh and of the highest quality.  From there we snacked on some beautifully prepared calamari.  Then, my party of three shared the pound of king crab legs, which were succulent and perfectly steamed.  We also shared a seafood salad with fresh, vibrant ingredients, as well as a side of flavorful sauteed green beans, which were accented with a lovely Romesco sauce.  Finally, we capped off our dining extravaganza with the best lemon meringue pie I have ever had.  I would make the trek to this restaurant for the pie alone, but couldn't imagine denying myself the magnificent seafood.  A truly wonderful dining experience!",

They were also kind enough to let us sit at a table instead of the bar and have happy hour there because we had the kids with us. I love it when a restaurant can be a little flexible.

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Best raw bar in Phoenix.  There, I said it.  Little Cleo's comes close, but I think Buck and Rider just edges them out.  Point of comparison is mostly to oysters, and when it comes to oysters, no one has beat out Hog Island in SF and 167 Raw in Charleston.  Buck and Rider comes very close to these, and for this and various other reasons, deserves its 5-star rating.  The first time we went, visited with another couple so we got to try a little of everything.  The stone crab claws we got were excellent.  And on a side note, 1/2 off all raw items at the bar during happy hour, which is a long happy hour here.  Another nod to the 5-stars.  Also ordered the mussels and mini-lobster rolls.  Mussels were above average, and despite the fact that these lobster rolls were over-sauced, they are pretty darn tasty.  Don't expect a truly authentic Maine lobster roll because you'll be disappointed, but with a little open-mindedness, these little guys can rock your world.  Entrees were the scallops, crab cakes, loup de mer, and Hong Kong style halibut.  My friend said the scallops were some of the best of her life, I agreed they were delicious.  The crab cakes were full of actual crab meat, so bonus points there.  My wife always orders loup de mer wherever she sees it and she said it was also one of the better ones she has had, to which i concur.  Finally, the halibut, which i ordered.  The fish was thick and cooked well, so credit there.  But in terms of the overall flavor of the dish - too much soy sauce.  It was the most one-dimensional \"Asian\" style sauce I've ever had.  That, and very minimal bok choy on the side, which soaked up all the soy sauce flavor, as did the rice, making kind of a salty mess.  If the sauce were to improve, I would rate this single dish as excellent but otherwise, it is mediocre to almost poor.  But all that being said, after a few visits, we still love this place.  The vibe is cool, the staff is friendly, and the food, with only a couple exceptions, has been excellent.  Here's to hoping they keep up their raw bar standards.",

We ordered four kinds of oysters, Kumamoto, Miyagi, Sun Hollow and Wellfleet. They were all very good. We tried the Thai Crab salad and it came with a very spicy dressing which I loved.  We also ordered the Brussel Sprouts, which were good but a bit too fried and it came with a warm goat cheese dip that I didn't care for so much.   Overall it was a nice experience, I didn't like the valet only parking, waiting 45 mins and it is a bit pricy. $180 for two people is a bit much for this to be a regular spot for me.

Alright, enough with this ode to the crispy brussels.  Oysters. Yes. Always. Fresh. Good. Yes. Solid. Yes.  Everything else that I've tried were good; I'd say the shrimp ceviche is a good runner up.

Fish, Virginia striped bass was over cooked and the portion microscopic. Cole slaw was overly vinegary. Only half decent item I at was dinner rolls, which were not gratis as they are virtually everywhere I dine in any city but cost $7 here. Atmosphere noisy and waitress annoyingly used the \"are we\" approach every time she addressed me. A poor choice if you're visiting the area and, if you live in Phoenix, you can do much better eating in Leventhal if you're a lousy cook.",

    "text": "RIDE ON CAMELBACK!   I'll make this one short n sweet - get the seafood!   Or the steak!   I did enjoy a delicious medium-rare filet here (all butchered in house, btw) however the photo evidence has gone by the wayside from some time back and I swore that I'd revisit it (get another steak!) prior to the review however that seafood..oh that seafood is hard to resist and so I have not.   The selection of oysters is very good - around six from which to choose (seafood flown in daily) and I appreciate how they'll even let you order one of each if you'd like. Especially on happy hour - half off - such a deal. Few places will let you order even just one oyster (I know, who would do this?!) but sometimes, I'd like only three or four and that's ok here.   The steak tartare is excellent and also an adequate portion size - points for that! The calamari was good, a bit greasy for our liking. They have a whole or half lobster offered for $24/$12 respectively (happy hour price, I believe) - again, so nice for getting a taste.  They have a daily selection too of fresh fish in entree portions.   I'm a Grey Goose consumer (or craft, small batch) and they don't offer it - Belvedere is their top shelf - tried the house vodka and didn't care for it, but worse, the bleu cheese olives were mush. (I need structural integrity in the olive.) The server was excellent and offered another cocktail but I saw it through! (Just no further olive testing.) Next time, its Belvedere or bust.   With the large, open bar and high tops offering a lengthy happy hour, and a restaurant section that's not cramped, plus a generous-sized patio out front - surely you'll find a comfy spot here. Oh!! And fabulous kudos to the architects --- I was jonesin' to hit a rooftop -I'd said yesterday morning, \"I'd like a view\".... I knew there was none from the bar area but wait! Just go to the restroom. That was the first place I visited yesterday and I appreciated the gorgeous vista of Camelback.   Great job, Buck and Rider.   (PS- I didn't know - \"Buck and Rider\" is their oyster cove in Washington and hence, the name. They offer these oysters daily.)",

    "text": "Finally found my favorite fresh seafood spot in the valley! Wow. What a hidden gem. So glad I found out about this place from a friend after seeing her amazing looking food pics on Snapchat!   My husband and I came for lunch on a Saturday and it turned out it was \"National Oyster Day!\" Luckily there was no wait and we were greeted right away. Our service was wonderful throughout the dining experience and everyone we encountered was super friendly and efficient. Ambience was really upbeat, laid back, and an open bar feel. We noticed they were setting up outdoor seating with another bar area, which I'm sure gets pretty busy and looks great in the evening.   Now to the food - it was superb! We tried the salt and pepper calamari with the Thai dipping sauce -- omg so good - may have been the best I've ever had! The sauce with peppers gave it a nice kick and was so flavorful. Definitely getting that again! We also ordered a few sushi rolls which were incredibly fresh and loved the unique combinations offered. I believe one had macadamia nuts inside and another had almonds. Those flavors merged well with the fresh shrimp, crab and other delicious  fillings. Feeling daring, my husband tried the raw oysters and surprisingly really liked them. The cocktail sauce, horseradish and other tangy sauce they were served with really enhanced the oyster flavor. Since we were filling up, we decided to split the crab cake blt and it was also excellent.   Next time I'm saving room for dessert. The couple next to us ordered some sort of merengue pie and it was HUGE. Being the nosy girl I am, I had to lean over and ask how it was -- they said it was to die for! I overheard the manager telling them the flourless chocolate cake is also her favorite and is served with an amazing flavorful gelato.   Yum yum yum. Can't wait to return and show this place off to our friends visiting from out of town!",

Unfortunately, his birthday was on National Oyster Day and the restaurant was ill prepared for their oyster event.  We arrived at 7:00 for a 7:00 dinner reservation and were told they were running a few minutes behind. We attempted to get a drink at the bar but it was too crowded with people and then didn't have Captain Morgan, my bf's drink of choice.  So we continued to stand and wait....and wait...and wait.  Finally at about 7:25 I asked how much longer it would be and was told that a couple of tables were paying and then we'd be seated.  About 15 minutes later, 40 minutes after our reservation, we were seated.  Our server was great and came to take our drink order.  We ordered some cocktails and an order of the pull apart rolls since we were starving after standing there for 40 minutes.  After our drinks were served, the server came back to tell us she was just informed they were out of the rolls.  So now we've waited 40 minutes, watched rolls coming out of the kitchen, are starving and can't even get some bread to stave off the hunger while we look at the menu.  This is not a good sign.  We ordered a Caesar salad to share.  It came out and was decent, but we still wanted bread!  What restaurant doesn't have bread.  So I asked if there was any other bread available and our server did bring us a couple pieces of sourdough toast.  Not great, but better than nothing.  Everything did get better from there.  We both ordered filet and it was flavorful and cooked precisely how we asked.  The sides were good. The restaurant also bought my boyfriends choice of birthday dessert.  If I was rating just the food, I would give it a 4.  Out server would get a 5. The restaurants accommodations/preparedness a 0.  Reservations are made for a reason, so I think it's unacceptable to make someone wait 40 minutes for their table, especially when aware that it is a special occasion celebration.  And to run out of the first appetizer listed on the menu at 7:40 on a Saturday night was also unacceptable.  This restaurant seems like it would be fun and enjoyable for a date or with a group if it ran smoother and didn't have so many issues that we encountered which put a huge damper on my boyfriends birthday.",

They even added a \"48\" candle to my friends bday dessert. Thank you for a delicious evening!",

The Steak tartare is amazing and ridiculously cheap $9 as I type this. It comes with 3 pieces of endive and about 6 pieces of perfectly toasted and halved sourdough bread.   Trust me...get this item. It's the most bang for your buck. I guess the best way to describe this is, it's like a party in your mouth and everyone is coming.",

We've been here on other Happy Hour days, but I think because it's all day on Sunday it doesn't get quit so packed, a stream of people throughout the day, maybe?  I can only speak for Happy Hour seating at the bar is very good along with service. The Happy Hour selection is very good. My friend and I had a dozen Buck & Rider Oysters, Steak Tartare, and the Dixie Chicken Fingers. My only complaint and I don't know why: The Flies are out of control in the Bar area, the 3 times we've been there so far (always sitting at the bar by the back entrance). I don't like flies near me or landing near my food. Maybe fly strips or something?  Atmosphere: very nice, Food: very good, Service very good",

    "text": "Welp... Buck & Rider, you've TOTALLY redeemed yourself! My first visit wasn't the absolute greatest, but I said I would give it another try... and this time around... wow, just wow. I was absolutely impressed -- not only by the food, but all around!    My boyfriend and I went in on Saturday night since he was craving seafood, and I had my fingers crossed that Buck & Rider wouldn't disappoint. We showed up around 8:30pm to a packed house, however we only waited maaaybe ten minutes for a seat to open up -- and it was in the bar area so we could take advantage of the amazing reverse happy hour -- yay! (We were a bit early, though, reverse happy hour doesn't start until 9:30pm). We were seated quickly, greeted by our amazing server, brought menus, water, and my boyfriend was given the \"welcome shpiel\" since it was his first time in.   I ordered the Ace in the Hole (I highly recommend if you like tequila!) It was light, fruity, and summery, although perfectly balanced and not overbearingly sweet.  For dinner, we decided to order a few different menu items and share so we could have a variety. We ordered the following:  * Baja Style Seafood Cocktail: Jumbo lump crab, shrimp, scallops, and tomato. Super yummy, although I ate all the crab and shrimp and then was only left with scallops... which are not my favorite, so I left those for my boyfriend, hehe. * Voodoo Fried Rice (My FAVORITE!): Fried rice with shrimp, organic chicken, peas, gojuchang (aka a red chili paste/sauce), and red fresnos. Think of a cross-over between jambalaya and fried rice. It was so delicious, and the flavors were phenomenal! I ordered another one so I could take home and enjoy the deliciousness the next day. Highly recommend!  * Sushi Grade White Fish Ceviche: avocado, cherry tomato, roasted sweet potato, fennel, and scallops. This was good too, although not my favorite so I only had a few bites -- it was a smidge too \"fishy\" for my liking, but then again, seafood tends to be \"fishy\", lol. * Crunchy Shrimp Roll: Roasted almonds, avocado, spicy mayo, and Serrano peppers. Delicious and different with the roasted almonds; the hint of that roasted almond flavor added extra pizazz to the roll. I would absolutely recommend it, and order it again on a future visit.   We also received tortilla chips and saltines with our food, although I'm not sure which ordered item they officially \"come with\".   The service was exceptional, and I was thoroughly impressed at how quickly the food came out -- I felt like we would barely place our order and next thing we knew, our food was on our table. The presentation of everything was extremely appetizing (see photos), and I assure you, everything was just as delicious and flavorful as it looked! Thank you, Buck & Rider -- the server, management, and staff that made our evening so wonderful! We'll see you again soon!!!",

    "text": "Stopped in the other night for a quick bite and was pretty impressed. We only had calamari and sushi, so will definitely need to come in and try more of their options. I really like how they provide you with a card that tells you all about their freshly flown in catches that are available that day, including where each fish is from. Our food came out very quickly. The calamari was good and had a different breading from a lot of calamari I have had in the past. It was very light but there is added texture from a bit of cornmeal. It comes with two sauces, both were good though the more liquidy one had a bit too much vinegar for me. The sushi was good, but not amazing, and all the rolls had a little bit too much rice in my opinion. The crunchy shrimp roll could use a sauce on the plate because it was lacking flavor and the lobster trobanjan was pretty much what I expected. The baked yuzu Roll has a very interesting taste, almost meaty, still not really sure how I feel about it lol. The lemon meringue pie is definitely the dessert to get if you want something to take a picture of. It has a delicious insanely buttery crust and I was happy with the consistency of the curd/custard. I would have preferred a bit more acidity in the custard and an Italian meringue would create a better mouth feel in my opinion, but still very yummy. Overall a good dining experience with good service and of course complimentary salted chocolate chip cookies are a great way to end a meal!",

We had the shrimp ceviche as an appetizer and it was great tasting and actually a huge portion for the 4 of us to share. I had the \"evil Thai crab salad\" which was great but the dressing was  super spicy  .  Hubby has the chicken and he said it was delicious. Friends had the mussels which were great and the ribs. All in all a great experience plus good tasting food.  Downside was just the intense noise level in the restaurant.",

PROVISIONS: Salt & Pepper Crispy Calamari $13 *chewy, under seasoned and Thai dipping sauce was too sweet  Steak Tartare $18 *underwhelming and a bit bland, I also think I would've preferred the tartare on seasoned crackers, just ok  ROLLED SUSHI Baked Yuzu Crab Roll $16 Blue crab, topped with spicy tuna and Serrano peppers, soy paper *this roll had the essence of crab and I liked the heat from the peppers and the spicy tuna tasted really fresh, I ate every last piece  ENTREES Fresh Blue Crab Cakes $32 Pommery mustard sauce, gojuchang spice, summer squash with romesco *really confused by this dish!  I'm from Baltimore and these were a 1 on a scale of 1 to 100.  Awful.  No lump crabmeat (should've asked what part of the crab is used for the crab cakes).  They were shredded bottom of the barrel crab, and densely packed and no sweet crab flavor not to mention the accompaniments were so bold it completely overwhelmed the crab!  Don't waste $32, order something else.  New York Strip $35 *ordered medium rare, came out almost blue, sent back, they recooked the same piece of meat (found this a little odd) it was just ok, a little pricey for a strip steak and nothing would compel me to order this again.  DESSERT: Flourless Chocolate Cake w/Pistachio Ice Cream *pretty rich and decadent, everything you want in a chocolate cake, loved it, great portion couldn't finish it  COCKTAILS: Your Money or Your Life: $11 Old Forester Bourbon, Benedictine, Combier, orange bitters.  Good old-fashioned with a big ice cube.  Aunt Charlie: $10 Aylesbury Duck vodka, earl grey tea, honey-lemon shrug, served up.  The server explained it was like an Arnold Palmer.  This was not like an Arnold Palmer, the drink actually made me wince when I drank it.  Personally not a fan and I would maybe ask for it on the rocks or substitute it w Tito's, I think the vodka tasted like rubbing alcohol.",

That may seem obvious as it is a seafood restaurant, but most places like this do also offer vegetarian or vegan options. As a vegetarian myself I honestly cannot remember what I even ordered.

Warm, soft pretzel bread. Yum!   They have a great variety of drinks, something for everyone.   I got the crab cakes as my main dish. These crab cakes had so much crab in it, as opposed to many restaurants, where you get a lot of fillers.  I appreciated the amount of crab! The crab cakes came with asparagus, which was nicely seared and had a sauce that was a tad spicy but that sauce was just drizzled on a little. There was another sauce that came on the plate that went well with the asparagus and crab cakes.   The other favorite dish at the table seemed to be the halibut.   This place was really busy! Definitely recommend making a reservation.",

They have a large trendy indoor space as well as a beautiful outdoor patio. Service was a bit slow but we had a big group so it was understandable.  In terms of food, here is what I tried: - Cocktails (5/5): I got a bloody mary which was hearty and flavorful, and also tried my friend's \"Greyhound\" (gin and grapefruit), which was really smooth and delicious as well. - Voodoo fried rice (5/5): great for sharing! Really tasty fried rice with shrimp and chicken, and just the right amount of spice from gojuchang (korean spicy paste).  - Crab cake benedict (5/5): one of the best crab cakes I've had in a long time, filled with large chunks of crab. Poached eggs and hollandaise were done just right also.  - Port St. Lucie fish sandwich (4/5): probably about as good as a fish sandwich can be, although paled in comparison to the other dishes. The fries were very thin and well-seasoned though.   This place can be a bit more on the pricey side, but well worth it in my opinion, and a great place to celebrate special occasions!",

I ordered the 1/2 lb king crab and the amount of crab was laughable. My assessment is too much money for food that is not that good. I will not return.  1/16/2018 After my previous Yelp review, I was contacted by Laura who apologized for our sub-par experience. She went out of her way to make things right and I experienced fantastic customer relations, which has not happened in a long time.  After her making things right, I will give them another go. Just on customer service and relations they are ok in my book.",

    "text": "My wife and i recently moved back to PHX after 5 years in the OC. We have a lot of new restaurants to try out and we decided to try Buck & Rider because we heard they have a good happy hour. We are big fans of LGO, Chelsea's Kitchen and looked forward to trying their new concept. Evidently so do others others because it was PACKED and the host was taking names for a table in the bar area. We stood up outside the bar the reception area and ordered some drinks and some happy hour food items while waiting about 30 minutes to sit down.  Positives - the food was good and the staff was helpful and polite, in spite of being overwhelmed by the large crowd. The sunset few of Camelback Mountain was awesome. Valet parking was free.  Negatives - it took some explanation from the staff and nearby patrons to figure out what was or was not included in the happy hour. The happy hour was only available at the inside bar - the outside bar was full price. The NOISE inside was excruciating, especially once we moved back to the bar table. My wife and I had to scream across the table to hear each other, which evidently is what the rest of the bar was doing. It was so LOUD that i used the noise meter on my iPhone to see it was 90+ decibels - borderline red zone. The noise was equivalent to an emergency vehicle. Not relaxing at all. Finally, the tab for two people  (2 beers, 1 gin & tonic, 1 glass of wine, 3 small plates) for happy hour, with tip was $100.  Bottom line - we will go to Hillstones or Chelsea's Kitchen or keep searching for a another good happy hour venue. We will try the Buck & Rider reverse happy hour after a movie some day.",

Our server came to our table 4 times to take an order ---again, we're waiting on 2 more.  She offered to bring us bread but told us, \"there's a charge...so I don't know if you would want it??...\"  Totally awkward.  We ordered it anyway. Soon as our friends arrived, another server took over our table and asked if we wanted to order before the other two even had a glass of wine poured.---We felt rushed.  As we drank and ate, the server continuously came to our table, interrupting our conversation to ask if we wanted to order more...it was annoying; we had ordered 2 bottles of wine and 4 appetizers and bread...and all the while someone else was walking through the bar with a tablet on their wrist 'inventorying' the tables... It was so uncomfortable and not relaxing at all.  We won't go back.",

All delicious. But the service was terrible. We waited about 20 minutes for a server and complained to the manager before someone took a drink and appetizer order. And then we had multiple waitstaff helping us-they called it team service but I called it confusing, inefficient and frustrating. I couldn't even get anyone to take my payment and had to approach the manager to get it taken care of. So great food but lousy service.",

The raw bar selection is also very vast for this area, as well as delicious. Sitting at the bar sets a great glimpse of the entirety of the restaurant, the view of Camelback isn't half bad either. Would definitely revisit this restaurant not only for the food but from the hospitality I received from the bartenders. Good vibes.",

The dessert we had was the 3 layer chocolate cake very rich pairs wells with the gelato!! Service is excellent and very attentive! Overall a must place to go in Arcadia:)",

At this point I'm in no hurry to return. The prices seemed on the high side, especially for the sushi. Great location and patio, well executed design of the restaurant. Food was just 'meh.'",

Fresh seafood is SO hard to come by in AZ and after moving back from San Fran a couple of months ago, this is exactly what I needed on a rainy Sunday evening.   We ordered a bottle of wine with a dozen oysters, a few from each of their selection. The oysters were followed by the steam PEI mussels which were out of this world. Wonderful pepper and rosemary flavors with chopped garlic... I'm still drooling over these!! And served with their house cornbread... Ugh! We also ordered the tuna tostadas and the beef tartar. They give you a MASSIVE serving of tartar with an egg yolk to top it off. The tostadas were fantastic, not too spicy and the pickled jalapeno, carrot combination was a great addition to the ahi and avocado combination. I could have eaten all three and been completely satisfied. We didn't have enough room to order anymore food, but will be back to explore more!  The only hiccups to our meal were the oysters, I had a lot of shell particles in each of the four that I ate. Shucking isn't easy and it is a new restaurant, so I can't fault anyone. Also, our bottle of wine was delivered and already open. I'm not a stickler for abiding by all of the formal dining \"rules\", but that one may be better left as is, just for the peace of mind of the guest. Still a great meal and left satisfied! Keep it up!",

The lemon meringue is the best, but the chocolate cake is amazing as well! Don't forget the LGO Cookies on the way out.   From a service standpoint, the managers are always attentive and friendly. Dama behind the bar is awesome; she used to be at Ingo's and has always been great. I always ask for Sophie to be my server, she seems very happy to be there and always recommends the best food!

Our hotel screwed up brunch (for 150 might I add) so we started calling places and Buck and Rider were very welcoming and accommodating. We couldn't get all 150 to join us but we had around 50 and all food and drinks came out VERY quickly. Can I tell you 12$ bottomless mimosas are the best deal in town. Seafood was very fresh...we had oysters and stone crab damn good. I also ordered the brussel spouts and a burger (add bacon and a fried egg trust me) All amazing!!!!

Every bit had a chunk of crab and the watermelon radish and endive were my favorite dippers adding a crunch to a meaty savory bite.   For the main course I had the sea scallops with risotto which was AMAZING! Tip for the wise: savor every bite, because at the end of your plate you will be disappointed there isn't more.   For dessert was the chocolate torte and pistachio ice cream...rich and decadent!   I will definitely be returning for their happy hour :)   So if you enjoy quality seafood, which is hard to find in the desert, give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed!",

My sister & I (as little kids) used to drop our own baskets off the docks and take home crab for dinner. Brings back memories of the fish markets. The Shrimp Bisque has so much flavor  and if your not into seafood, thats cool too.

Ahi Tuna tostada, tuna was perfect, spice was too much for my taste, but I'm not a spicy lover. The Clam chowder was not chowder, more like soup, but it was a gastronomic treat. The textures, variety and flavor was at another level. A unexpected treat, a must try! My preference is that the bar is stocked with at least one favorite Tequila and they serve 1942 Anejo.  For the service, a solid 7, not bad, but not extraordinary.  I think I need to try again for dinner if I can  muster the discipline try something else. The chowder and the shrimp skewer are addicting!  Part TWO. (Full disclosure Allison gave me a gift certificate to come back)  Well... The clam chowder and fresh shrimp had to begin the feast. Growing up in Florida, fresh BIG shrimp always brings back fond memories. We tried the crab dip and I must say WOW! The wife enjoyed the (not) sea bass. It was a perfectly prepared fish with broccolini. The Boston kid and the Burbank kid both had the lobster rolls and were not disappointed. My crab cakes were great. The manager Laura stopped by to say hi. Of course we will be back! The ambiance is worth the trip. The food is just a treat that completes the experience. Love this place. LGO rocks!",

The food and service are always consistent- except for the new mussels, not crazy about those!- it's our favorite neighborhood stop and always run into our friends at the bar. The patio is great on weekends for brunch and mimosas too",

I came in for my birthday dinner (along with tons of other times before that) and was left feeling the most content I've felt in a long time!!! I was SOOOOO satisfied! food coma-heaven everything from the appetizers to the main dishes were amazing! I had the sea bass and oh my word was it fabulous! We ended up going with a large group of people, so I ended up trying almost everyone's dish and nothing left me feeling disappointed! If you are into seafood at all you have to try this place!!!   The cocktails are also amazing... Actually, a little too good that I can put back several and not notice until I stand up!  This spot is also a wonderful brunch place! If you do end up going during brunch time please do yourself a favor and try their hash browns!!! They come out on a hot skillet with sour cream and I'm not kidding when I tell you I could eat these everyday for the rest of my life and never be sad ever again!  Service... I'd give just the service 10 stars if I could! All the staff from the managers to the bussers are all super friendly and knowledgeable!   I'll be back a million time over! YUMMMM!",

It was fantastic, although I would get the toast without the butter on it next time, took away from how good the meat is. I also tried a couple sushi rolls, the crunchy shrimp and spicy tuna. Very familiar tasting but you could tell the fish was fresh! My waitress was a little blonde woman named Savannah, she was prompt, attentive, and had a wealth of knowledge to offer me about their menu. I will absolutely be back between the great food and amazing service!",

We started with a real crab california roll and the shrimp and chorizo skewers - yummy!  For our entrees, we enjoyed the pasta and the crab cakes - again, very tasty and flavorful.  For dessert, we enjoyed the lemon meringue pie and the four layer chocolate cake - sinfully good!  The food was fantastic, the atmosphere is really nice and sure to be the next \"it\" dinner spot in Phoenix and the service was fantastic - especially since it was just dress rehearsals.  Thanks for a great experience!",

    "text": "My hubby and I had Sunday brunch here this last weekend.  We've had brunch there once before.  Both times we decided to sit at the bar so we could watch whatever sporting event was on, and be a little bit out of the way.  We love their special Greyhound cocktail (with gun) so of course we had to start the process of figuring out what to eat while enjoying one of those.  They have an excellent raw bar at Buck and Rider.  We ordered a Dungeness crab cocktail and my husband ordered three oysters from the pacific NW.  The cocktail sauce knocks your socks off and is delicious.  The crab was fresh and really tasty as well.  The oysters were a little to big for my liking so I'll have to defer to his assessment that they too were fresh and delicious.  For our main meal we shared their delicious hash brown potatoes, served golden brown and oven hot in a cast iron pan.  They were deliciously crunchy but moist, and had a large dollop of sour cream and chives on top.  Yum!!  We also shared a French omelet which is clearly large enough to share, and comes with a cool crispy and tangy salad on the side.  My only complaint was that there wasn't enough gruyere in the omelet.  I actually had a hard time tasting it.  Overall however, this is rapidly becoming our favorite Sunday morning spot.  I highly recommend the experience.",

And they brought out our sides a good 5 minutes before main meal, which I didn't like. The Brussel sprouts were delicious tho. The bread was nothing special and I'm surprised they charge for it. It too came out way before the meal so it was cold by the time the food came. My father in law also ordered come oysters (I didn't try then) but he said they were wonderful. The fish was great, and scallops were also good but a bit salty. And they only came with three. The New York  and fillet were very good.  The sides each dish came with were unique and tasty. The chief  clearly had unique ideas, and I appreciated that- just needs a bit more fine tuning.  Main dishes were all good and price was reasonable. My mixed drink was not that great. And the biggest complaint I had was the waitress was a little rude. I'd definitely go back tho because the Food made up for the service. The restaurant is cute, nice ambience and clean.",

We were there on a Sunday night and it was surprisingly crowded, although there was no wait . No reservations taken. Sitting at a table for 2 we found ourselves straining our voices  just to hear each other. Very Noisy beyond ability to have normal conversation . But my biggest complaint is value for the price. $20 for one crab claw??!!! $17 for a glass of Anderson valley Chardonnay ! Come on ?! Bill for dinner for 2 with one glass of wine each was almost $200!!  Much better places, for better value elsewhere .",

The sushi (on happy hour) is vegetarian and not that good, so don't bother. Some of the staff are amped up which is off-putting. They should chill out instead of using it as an opportunity to show people how strong they are or how much cocaine they've done that day.",
