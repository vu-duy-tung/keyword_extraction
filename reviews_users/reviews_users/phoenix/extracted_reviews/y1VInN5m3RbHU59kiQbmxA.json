    "text": "I visited Phoenix and tried about 5 different Mexican restaurants, and this by far was the best one- fresh, hearty, and reasonably priced.  They had absolutely delicious, freshly squeezed juices- Cantaloupe, Pineapple, and Watermelon- they topped it off all the time, absolutely great.  We also got their guacamole which was good with cheese on top.  Their chips were stone-ground thick and grainy, crunchy chips (not the thin, oily chips I've gotten elsewhere) and their red chipotle and green pico de gallo sauces were thick, creamy, and super fresh (not like I've had at other places).  They all tasted lke they were just made in mortle, pestle, and blender in their kitchen.  I got their Filet Mignon with melted cheese on the bottom of the plate and sauteed veggies on top.   Very good, meat was very soft and cooked perfectly, worked well with a good combo of cheeses and the veggies.  Came with flavorful, soft rice and beans- all worked very well together.  My co-eaters got the duo stews (with chicken and pork) and something else which they both loved.  It's decorated well with lots of festive colors.  Go visit this place and support it!",

I grew up here, born and raised here in the valley .... I now live in another valley... Of the silicon type and I can assure you we have nothing like this that even comes close anywhere in California! I've been all over the planet for work and pleasure. These guys do the real deal! And... The best part is that while it's easily 5 star food, it's totally affordable... We ordered 4 margaritas, a great shrimp dish to share, table side made guacamole and with tip it was $55 out the door! All ingredients are ultra fresh and home made! Including the simple syrup in the margarita!  An amazing destination restaraunt for date nights, etc. highly recommend!",

Should have checked my bill closer. They charged me a $9.00 open bar fee!  I only had one Margarita that they charged me $6.00 for. I only asked for a little additional Pico and we got extra chips that we did not ask for. Tried calling them but no one wants to answer my question and they tell me to call back in 10 minutes and then again after 2pm..... The food is okay but not worth the price. After tip for two people I paid $60.00!",

    "text": "3.5 stars rounded down to 3.   This restaurant has somewhat of an identity crisis. Also known as \"Asi Es La Vida\" (you can find reviews on Yelp under that name as well) from the outside it looks like kind of a fun, colorful Mexican place. Then you enter (through the back door only) and you are confused by the decor. Fancy linens, silverware and plating say \"fine dining\" but the uber colorful walls and standard Mexi-decorations on the walls send more of a \"home cooking\" message. In fact, the restaurant is oddly shaped and seems like it was once someone's home, or store front, but definately not a restaurant.   The service is impeccable, and again, a little confusing. The waitress placed my napkin on my lap for me and was extremely friendly, then took 20 minutes to bring chips and salsa to the table.   The menu is pretty limited and fairly priced. The food though, leaves something to be desired and is, again, a little manic. Take previously mentioned chips and salsa for instance: AMAZING salsas. Very fresh and very delicious, they were paired with some of the crappiest chips I've ever eaten at a Mexican restaurant. Very strange.   Their Agua Frescas are also amazingly refreshing. Freshly made and free refills, booya.   The food, while good, missed the mark just a bit. My buddy had the chilequiles (a personal favorite of mine) and I had the Recalentado (Mexico city for left overs) which is Cochinita and Chicken Mole. I felt the cochinita was a little too sweet and citrusy while the mole was a little too savory. Again, something just not right.  Both plates were good and all but, as I say, weren't over the top delicious. Both meals, drinks, and tip took us to about 25 bucks.   I would definately eat here again, but not sure that I would go out of my way to head to this place....",

It was dark for ambiance but brightly decorated, white linen tables, fresh flowers on each table, parrots mirrors etc.etc.  We started with the Guacamole and tostadas with a salsa trio  (see pics) Pico De Gallo, Chipotle and the most Divine Fresh Tomatillo Salsa I have ever tasted, I was literally eating it with a spoon once the chips ran out!  Everything was so fresh and tasty!  We also ordered a Watermelon Agua Fresca which was so refreshingly delicious, even though I'm not sure it was a good mix with Mexican food (we took it to go)  I ordered the Enfrijoladas: Homemade corn tortillas filled with chicken and topped with a black bean sauce (see pics) WOW! This was so Perfect I can even begin to tell you how Much I LOVED it!  My guest ordered the Farolitos Al carbon with Chicken (see pics) The taco came with rice speckled with fresh veggies like corn and chiles along with a bowl of soupy pintos. Another Amazing dish even though the tacos were pretty spicy overall it was all very fresh and flavorful.  Unfortunately we did not have room for dessert , but that's just one more reason to come back.  Did I mention the waitstaff team.......Impeccable service!  My glass never emptied, in fact It never even got half full.  I can't forget the man on guitar ,I mean  who doesn't love being serenaded during Lunch!  A Definite Must Try Folks!

    "text": "This joint seems fairly unassuming from the outside, but inside it's brightly painted with colors of traditional Mexico. The staff is really friendly and the food is excellent. From the shrimp appetizers to the tortilla soup to the chicken enmoladas, they've hit a home run each and every time I've been there. The agua frescas are a perfect complement to the meal and are strongly recommended. The only downside is the place lost its liquor license some time back so it's booze-free, but you wouldn't even notice it because everything else is so good. The warm atmosphere is an added bonus - something many ethnic restaurants fail at providing.  Definitely a great stop. I say forgo your hankering for Filiberto's check  this place out atleast once.  EDITED SEPT. '07: Seems like Asi Es La Vida has had some issues with the Maricopa County Health Department. Knock a few stars right there. And they're STILL waiting for their liquor license? Uh, it's going on almost two years now. Something's not right with this picture.",

As intimate and high style as it might be you wont feel out of place in shorts and a t-shirt.   The service was friendly and attentive. The menu is creative and tasty. The food is delicioso. Even the stews are light. The ingredients are fresh and well prepared. The plates are beautifully presented.  I had the slow roasted pork in an orange sauce and my what a dish. The pork was tender, juicy and plentiful. The orange sauce was an odd but perfect compliment. The rice was light and loaded with vegs, The black beans were meh (the low spot of the meal) but add a little of their wonderful salsa and you're set. Did I mention the warm and comforting corn tortillas. If they weren't fresh pressed I'm crazy and served warm.  This is not the mexican food you see where I come from (Tennessee) where the ingredients are mounds of plopped refritos, fake saffron rice and slathered in cheese. I do love that stuff but after the meal at this shrine to Frida Kahlo. Asi ES la Vida, por supuesto!",

Chips with fresh guacamole and salsas was a good choice; otherwise I probably would have been hungry after. It only came with a few chips (not enough), but they brought more as soon as we asked. A friend got the black bean sauce enchiladas (I think) and seemed happy; he said his tortilla soup was tasty but could have used some vegetables or something, because for most of it he was just spooning broth. He seemed a lot happier about the margarita; there are a lot of options for quality ones there. No problems with service. The place was empty at prime lunch time.",

The singer/guitar player is very talented; we sat at the booth to the left of his station & the sound was not overbearing at all. I took my leftovers home & had them for breakfast the next morning. There isn't really a selection of vegetarian dishes on the menu, but the server was extremely accommodating & rattled off an entire list of meals that the chef could prepare as vegetarian. Will absolutely be back!",

My other party enthusiast order the special of the night which was also some shrimp meal which she ate ever last spec on her plate.  Lastly my other friend and I had different filet mignon meals.  I did taste her meal which was the Felete Asi Es la Vida and it tasted wonderful; however, I had the Filete Chipotle (minus the chipotle sauce) which was extremely delightful.  I did order a sampler appetizer for the table which the waiter stated would be wonderful addition for our table and everyone ate everything.    For dessert we had an ice cream crepe which was so good I wanted to order another one but thought maybe I shouldn't.  Here's a True testament... I do not really care for Mexican food but my friend wanted to go to the best Mexican restaurant and I had asked some locals where the best Mexican restaurant was and they told me it was this place and that is and my friend said it was absolutely the best Mexican food she has eaten at.  And me personally not caring for Mexican food, I now love Mexican food and I love this restaurant. My birthday in on Wednesday and my friends already asked me where I wanted to eat and I said Asi Es la Vida - so we will see if I get my birthday wish :)  Anywho - great experience - love the staff and loved the food AND make sure TO definitely order the ice cream desert.

Tortilla soup, ceviche were delicious & flavorful. I had the filet mignon along with the rice & beans. I don't find many places that can make black beans that good, if any, however the chef here has mastered it. My filet was smothered in poblano which I love. Tender & flavorful. Our waiter was engaging, helpful & knowledgeable about the food & drink - what a breath of fresh air. The decor is cozy, beautiful & eclectic. Fresh flowers & white table cloth on the tables give that extra little touch of elegance. I thoroughly enjoyed the evening. Will be back... with guests.

Friendly staff make this place a great place to visit time and again. The chips are only okay but the three styles of salsa that they provide are amazing!

From the Frida gallery to the classic Latin music, this five star restaurant is an experience all Phoenicians must experience. Exceptional service, one of a kind plates and culture at it's core.

Well it was Sunday morning, and therefore I was very hungry. We were the only one's there but the waiter was so nice to us and took time to explain the specials and told us of their many freshly squeezed juices. I had pinneapple juice which was wonderfully flavored, Tortas, and homemade guacamole sauce. I was blown away, the chips were actually made there and real tortilla shells. He said weekdays were busy at night but weekends were rather empty, lunch crowd perhaps.

The place in funky and fun, and I really liked the eclectic decor.  The people are very friendly, and the food was tasty.  I had a great soup that I enjoyed very much. HOWEVER, I feel that the staff took advantage of our entire group.  Two people ordered small appetizers in which the staff took the opportunity to turn into multiple, small, $25 appetizer plates. We were not expecting this, and it inflated our bill dramatically.  I would say there was a little bit of a language barrier between us, but the staff certainly was able to flatly say they had explained it to us.  I feel we were  treated rudely, and our bill was deliberately inflated as no one else was in the restaurant.  The food was good, but certainly not worth the price, and although I will forgive many breaks of service, when it is done deliberately, I will not go back.

I would say the interior is tastefully done, the noise level was appropriate and the service was efficient. S and I both ordered the Torta lunch special ($7.95) and a drink ($3). The sandwich was really good and similar to a Cuban. Tasty roasted pork with cheese. Good stuff. I think the price for the drinks was a bit on the steep side, maybe $2.25 would be more appropriate. Also, our friend T joined us because he was in the neighborhood but had already eaten. So he just ordered a soda water with lime ($3). Now unfortunately, I have to get on my high horse here. 3 bucks? Really? It's water that's fizzed up by the carbonation in the soda machine. This should have been complimentary. If you bring a bottle of \"Club Soda\" and a glass of ice, sure, charge 3 bucks. But charging for water that's run through the machine is a joke. It's the little nickel and diming that will run your restaurant into the ground.  Since S and I both Yelp, we each got the five-dollar dessert for free offer when we checked in. I used mine and we got the tres leches flan.  It was good and S pretty much ate it all (he loves him some dessert), and it was free so no complaints here. It's a nice gesture. Good lunch value. Drinks overpriced. Charging for soda water. Friendly service. 3 Stars.",

    "text": "Well, I finally made it to Asi Es La Vida. It's kind of sad how long this place as been on my \"to-try\" list.   First, I love the quirkiness of this place. Being an eccentric individual myself, I felt right at home. Why aren't more places in Phoenix painted in bright, happy colors. This is the hot-ass desert, we don't need more brown.   Second, my server obviously had a passion for the food. I mean, he was excited about it. He made me want to eat it. I was like, you know the joys of a good foodgasm, don't you? You and your suggestions can be trusted.   Don't you hate it when you ask a server for their opinion and they have none. Wtf is up with that? Just make it up for god's sake. That's better than a shoulder shrug. You will find no shoulder shrugs at Asi Es La Vida.   Lastly, the mole. I love mole. There are very few places to get mole in Phoenix. I don't understand why, because it is literally heaven for your mouth. Asi Es La Vida's mole is on the sweeter side, which is fine with me, because I like all kinds of mole. Yes, there are different kinds. And, like I said, yes to all of them.   Ok, I'm not done. I have one small gripe. A teeny-tiny thing that won't keep me from coming back, but damn was it a bad choice. It has to do with the fabric covering the booth seats. It's corduroy. Freaking corduroy?! Have you ever tried slipping gracefully into a booth covered in that stuff? Well, I have now. It isn't easy or comfortable. All of your fabric is catching on all of the booth's fabric and it's just a mess. I had to adjust myself so many times it looked like I had hemorrhoids. No, no, my butt is fine, it's just this damn corduroy!",

No veggies, tortillas, rice, or zest in the broth.  Had to dump the itty bitty salsa that was on the table to give it even the minimal taste.  Marguaritas don't waste your money.  Our bill was $200 and the soup was my main course.  Three other people ordered but one was just a vegetarian dish. Hubby got a 4 pc shrimp dinner that was tasty & our other friend got Chilean sea bass that was okay.  I'm just saying it's very pricey for what you get.  The only thing that pops is the majenta color of the building.",

    "text": "Just about every food guide for Phoenix pointed me towards Barrio Cafe as a \"must try\", so I decided to check out that award winning restaurant. But after being told there was a minimum one hour wait for a table and seeing $22 enchiladas/$12 tortas on the menu that included a heavy fusion-spin, I decided that it wasn't for me.  I looked up a similar Mexican cafe nearby that also serves traditional Yucatan and Mexico City style dishes, and ended up outside a building painted in purple-flamingo pink called \"Asi Es La Vida\". From the color of the building to the surreal Frida Kahlo paintings that adorn the walls to the countryside Mexican music, this place had the vibrant and inviting personality that I liked. In addition, the prices were a little more reasonable compared to Barrio Cafe, so I gave it a try.  Based on what I found on the menu, I determined Asi Es La Vida prepares regional Mexican cuisine with a Mexico-City flair. I ordered the recalendato because it combined two of my Mexican favorites, mole and cochinita pibil.  My lunch began with thick corn chips that reminded me of tostada. It was accompanied with two of the best tasting homemade salsas I've ever had. The red salsa was my favorite because of its predominantly smoky profile, while the green salsa appeared to be a more bright, a verdant puree of coriander-mint and green chile. They're more like thick dips rather than the typical salsas at taco stands which I find to be either too chunky or too thin, and overly one-dimensional (simply variations with increasing intensity of heat and no distinct smoky tones available).  I did not do my research so I got \"hustled\" by the waitress - I said yes to guacamole when asked (who would say no, I later realized guac and chips were not a complimentary side). It came with another plate of chips. The guacamole wasn't assembled tableside, but tasted like it was made one by one to order with lots of avocado pulp, so it was actually worth the extra $3.95. The amount of lime flavor added was just right, not too bright.   The main course was decent but not exceptional. It tasted like a comforting dish prepared at someone's home. The rice was super light and bland, the beans were not refried with melted American cheese (thank goodness not border-style) but instead slow cooked with white cheese sprinkled on top like it is done in Mexico. I thought that the cochinita pibil was prepared better than the mole poblano. For the cochinita, the meat was served in chunks rather than like pulled pork, but the marinade was balanced between acidic and sweet. The only improvement I would suggest is to cook it more \"picante\", it was flat and missing an accent. On the other hand, the mole was a big disappointment since it was overly sweet without a hint of spicy flavor. It didn't have layered, complex, or intense bittersweet tones of the mole poblano that I have eaten before. The mole wasn't something I wanted to lick off my fork.  Overall, Asi Es La Vida was a pleasant change of pace from the Sonoran, Tex-Mex, and Southwestern food that is popular in Phoenix. The service was attentive and the restaurant is family-owned. It's not a loud place like Barrio Cafe plus there is tablecloth, so it could work as a cozy date restaurant. The food was more traditional than contemporary-fusion style. To best honest, I wasn't blown away by the food, but it tasted better than the other Mexican food I ate while staying in Phoenix.",

I'm not an expert on mexican food and don't have it often, but here's what i thought. + Carne tampiquena $18 - steak, rice, guac, and refried beans. Again it was okay... Nothing special..I actually prefer the striploin at other places, maybe mexican just isn't my thing.  + camaron al mojo - $25. I dont think this was worth it. It came with 4 shrimps which weren't that flavourful. There was also salad, corn, and rice, along with some garlicy bread. Not worth $25.... It didn't impress me.  + queso fundido $6 - this was an appetizer. I mainly got this cause it has nopales (CACTUS!!).. It's my first time travelling out west sooo yeah. This was maiinly just mushrooms and cactus cooked in melted cheese which you put in soft tortillas. The nopales just taste like green peppers, and the dish was just okay.   + margarita $6 - strong! But mm drink,  Don't forget to check in to claim your dessert! They gave us 3 types of desserts to choose from. We got the chocolate flam which was pretty decent. Soft and spongey.  But i'd probably wouldn't come back.",

There was a small bar and it was very dim inside for 11am. Perfect for dates. As it was, I was alone - but a lot of decor for me to look at while I waited. I passed another small seating area but I guess that was for overflow.  The waitress was super nice and suggested the guacamole and salsa sampler. I agreed. Salsa? Yes, please! The guacamole was delicious, home made! The green was my favorite, you can definently taste the lemon. The chunky salsa was spicy - perfect. The had a red salsa, but it had that mole taste to it....I dont' like mole. The chips were the regular tortilla chips you can get at the store - the green bag with the man wearing a sombrero...lol..not the best.  I order the Cesina dish. Thinly sliced meat with refried beans, rice and corn tortillas smothered in cheese and enchilada sauce. My first thought was, this is Mexican food? LOL Or am I just used to Filibertos/Juans?  The beef was tasty and not at all chewy like I expected. I was given two slices which was filling. The refried beans were good but the rice came with peas and carrots mixed in. For some reason seeing those little squares of carrots turn me off. Why from the bag? The toritllas reminded me of my dad's enchiladas. He'll take one tortilla, smother enchilda sauce and cheese on top and so on until he has about 5 layers. What was served was two layers, not typically how I eat tortialls. I actually almost asked for flour tortillas to eat my beef and beans with when I realized what the cheesy goo was at the end of my plate. But pairing the tortilla/cheesy goo with the beef and beans pulled the dish together.  Checking into yelp I recieved a free dessert. I showed the waitress my phone and after my meal she brought me a white tres leche's cake. Was there other options? Not sure, she didn't give me a choice. Thankfully it wasn't a chocolate desert.  All in all I thought it was a very beautiful atmosphere, especially if you were there with a date. The food was delicious and the employees nice. The parking is small and looks like during a busier time people would be forced to park along a residental street.",

Our friend got some kind of combo plate with beef and pork. It was great, but I liked the beef better. We got the chips and guacamole for an appetizer, they were fantastic. This is not a typical Mexican restaurant. They don't have any fried food. Their customer base leans more towards eating healthy. They said its Mexico City food. I want to go back soon. I don't know the specific names of the dishes, sorry.",

    "text": "I purchased a Groupon for this place as I live nearby and have driven by it a hundred times without really knowing what it was.  I was a little apprehensive after reading the other review stating that the service declined after they used the Groupon, but I was hungry so we went.  The first thing that surprised me was the level of service.  The amazingly kind waiter sat us, and then did the whole placing the napkin on your lap number, thoughtfully went over the specials and answered all of our questions, as well as making very helpful suggestions.  He was friendly, sincere, just awesome.  Our beverages never dropped below half full, and he ensured we had everything we needed and then some.  Towards the end I pulled out my phone to do the Groupon thing, he politely offered to take care of it, then after came back talking to us about how they are trying out Groupon to get more local customers.  He did not make us feel weird for using it, actually chatted with us about the origin of the restaurant and what they were trying to do.  And he did not add any auto-gratuity.  I actually tipped over 20% because this was the absolute best service I have received in a very long time!  Our food was delicious, I got the Cesina - very good, the salsas were excellent as was the guacamole.  My husband got something that was similar to a steak quesadilla, it was wonderful as well.  But as much as I loved the food, (and we loved the food!), I am still just blown away by the service.  Definitely 5 stars, and I have a new regular place for great Mexican food close to home!",

    "text": "Ambiance, decor, delectable regional cuisine from Mexico, all combine to make this a truly wonderful destination for all things Mexican.  The original chef, a former taco stand owner on the island of Cozumel, made his way here in the 90's and opened \"Such is Life\", a phrase he adapted from a friend who invested in his dreams back in the island days.  Once upon a time, this restaurant had garnered so much attention, it was even listed as one of Phoenix's most interesting dining destinations by the New York Times.  Although it has changed owners, they have tried to keep the original menu and the concept going strong.  From the hand painted portraits of Freda Kalo on the walls, to the colorful folk art and paintings, to the regional music playing softly over the speakers, this place smacks of authenticity inside and out.  When I am here, I feel like I am on holiday in the heart of Mexico.  And when my plate of Camaron Al Mojo de Ajo comes out, I am transported to the beach in Tulum or Puerto Vallarta.  First \"must try\" is the Crema De Cilantro.  Absolutely incredible soup with cilantro, garlic, potato puree, avocado, and chicken. As the name implies, it is divinely creamy and full of gorgeous, simple flavors.  Next on the list should be the Queso Fundido with poblano, championes, chorizo, and nopales.  Excellent!  A slightly different take on what you would expect from a standard queso, and it does not disappoint with all of the wonderful ingredients.  For a light and coastal entree, I recommend the Camaron Al Mojo De Ajo.  For $24.95 you get a very generous plate of large, plump, butterflied shrimp baked with garlic and virgin olive oil.  This is absolutely one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, as it also offers diners a more fine dining culinary exploration.  The menu is simple.  Other entree offerings include fish filet and leg of lamb, and filet mignon.  Appetizers range from $5.95-$12.95 from Ceviche Acapulco (marinated shrimp in fresh lime juice) to Coctel de Camaron (Pacific jumbo shrimp cocktail).  Absolutely everything ordered, down to the made to order guacamole and salsa verde (one of three salsas served at the table), the house margaritas, and Aqua frescas was outstanding and I would highly recommend a visit to this iconic Mexican restaurant.",

For my lunch entree, I had the green chicken enchiladas and an agua de sandia, which were both delicious! For dessert, we all shared a creme brulee, which was good. The best thing was the food, and the only downside would be the portion sizes for the price you pay, but it does not take away from the authenticity. Can't wait to go back with my husband!",

I have driven by for years and often wondered about the space, quality of food, etc. After seeing it featured on \"Check Please\" I grew increasingly curious. My partner and I have had this on our radar for some time and we finally made it in yesterday evening. We walked in and it was a bit disorienting finding our way to the front. I had read a couple of reviews both positive and negative about this experience but it was a welcome journey. We were warmly greeted and found a delightful spot to sit and enjoy this gem of a space. Decor is lovely, lighting was great and the ambiance was even better. Our server(s) were brothers and they were kind, informative and eager to help us make our way through the menu. We ordered the queso, sangria and I had the shrimp de ajo I believe. I mentioned to my partner that I appreciate when a chef elevates a dish with basic ingredients and that I do not have a problem paying a decent amount for food when the entree is presented in a creative manner.  This was the case here. We were in a bit of rush however I am eager to return and enjoy this restaurant. Kudos to this small business and I am proud to have it in my neighborhood.",

    "text": "I will start by saying that I don't know Mexican food. I put that disclaimer up so that if anyone ever reads these small insignificant little critiques of mine, I can always point to the claim I have no idea what truly this stuff is supposed to taste like because I am not a chef or even a professional. I work in IT for Pete's sake. With that said, this place was one of a kind. I may have only gone one time but that was all I needed.  The building is big, purple, and on the corner right on 24th Street. Talk about location. There is only about 8 parking spaces behind the place but not a worry because we were the first ones there for lunch. Your experience may vary. Inside is way more romanticly themed for 4 guys from work out on their lunch break. Small table, candles, I am not going to say more for fear of my sexuality being questioned. We were seated immediately and had ice water within moments. We ordered a plate of chips and salsa to wet the appetite. They brought us an entire plate covered in guacamole with freshly made chips individually stuck in it. This was a good signal of what was to come.  Fairly basic menu. Spanish terms that I can't easily pronounce. So I ordered what could best be described as a steak quesadilla but in this particular quesadilla was Chihuahua cheese. I have never heard of it before but once I tasted it I realized it is certainly something I won't soon forget. It is a creamy, mellow, and simply delicious cheese. Put that between a nice fresh tortilla and some savory steak and there you have a really great lunch. The only thing I can think of to ding the meal on was portion size. I by no means am a big eater. Quality over quantity all day long. But I could have used a little more to fill me up. Nitpicking, I am.  Go here. Eat lunch or dinner or whatever is appropriate for the time of day you are there. The staff truly care about your meal and your experience. The chef came out and asked us how it was and I never had a half empty glass much less a totally empty glass of tea. The host even unfolded our napkins and placed them on our lap. I have no idea if that is a cultural tradition or not, but it was very pleasant. I shall be back indeed.",

    "text": "I rarely post reviews on Yelp, but came straight to the computer after leaving Asi Es La Vida to post this review. I am writing this because I really don't want other diners to end up feeling like I do now, which is basically overcharged, under-fed and cheated out of a nice night out with my wife.   My wife and I eat out several times a week. We have been driving past Asi Es La Vida for years now, and finally decided to stop in tonight to celebrate a special occasion. I really wish we had picked a different restaurant.   Anyway, if you drive down 24th Street in central Phoenix with any degree of frequency, I'm sure you've seen Asi Es La Vida - the vibrant pink building is striking. You enter the restaurant through a narrow rear entrance and there is no host stand, or no one on duty to show you to a table. We ended up walking awkwardly through the narrow hallway, which eventually empties out into the bar area. We stood there, clearly looking bewildered, and no one came to help us. We had to flatten ourselves against the wall to make room for the server elbowing her way through the aisle. Finally, a bartender pointed to a table and we sat down. Don't expect someone to welcome you, or ask you about a seating preference. We would have liked to have been seated in one of the quieter back room areas, but instead were plunked down in a table next to a musician playing the guitar.   Our server arrived and took our drink orders. A few moments later, a different person arrived and asked for our drink orders. We had trouble discerning who are server was, since there seemed to be a confusing tag-team thing going on. A female server brought our drinks. Then, a few moments later, the same server brought another drink that we hadn't ordered. We told her that was not our order, and she took it away without saying anything.   Throughout our dinner at Asi Es La Vida, service was pretty awful: we asked for water and never got it. Had to flag the server again for water. The female server didn't come and check on us, only casually asked over her shoulder if everything was going while she worked on clearing a different table. Nobody said \"Thank you\" or \"Goodbye\" or any other basic pleasantries you expect at a sit-down restaurant.   I could honestly put up with cold, uncaring service if the food was great. And here is the rub:  ALMOST EVERYTHING WE ATE HERE WAS AWFUL. Like, cutting-corners-everywhere-to-turn-a-fast-buck level awful. Out of a tin can awful.   We started with the guacamole for two. We got a plate of guacamole with broken pieces of stale chips planted into what barely passes as guacamole for one. I have honestly gotten more guacamole by the friendly sandwich artists at Subway. Strangely, the guacamole is served with three ramekins of salsas: what are we supposed to do with all this salsa, and only about four chips between the two of us? The guacamole cost about $6.   Then came our queso fundido, which was essentially a small, greasy puddle of melted cheese on a flat plate. It came with chorizo and a few nubs of nopales (at least, I think there were nopales in there). It came with four tortillas, one of which was partly broken. You know how tortillas break when they are cold and stale? This was almost that bad. Plus, I know Food City tortillas very well, and these resembled them to a tee. Just don't expect fresh, good quality tortillas - don't even expect properly warmed up tortillas.   Then the entrees. I ordered the \"Borrego de Azteca\" ($19.95), which is described on the menu as a \"leg of lamb.\" There was no leg of lamb on the plate. Instead, I got a few chunks of chewy meat, a soupy, super-bland puddle of watery white rice, and corn. Ah the corn: someone went through the trouble of using a can opener and nuking them in a microwave for me. They were chewy and super bland, with that distinctly un-fresh taste you only get from food that has spent months in a pantry.   My wife got the mole plate, which was okay. But honestly, i really doubt there is any cooking going on in that kitchen.   Have you ever seen that Gordon Ramsay show, \"Kitchen Nightmares,\" the one where he tries to salvage languishing restaurants? This place really reminded me of the restaurants profiled in that show - before they have been rehabbed.   Please save your hard-earned money! You deserve to be treated with respect -  not as an afterthought, as if you are somehow intruding in someone's private home. Take your money and head over to Barrio Cafe, or even Taco Bell - at least they smile at you there while taking your money.",

I love Frida and art, so that takes it to 6 Stars as she is prominently featured in the main dining area while Diego Rivera gets the back hallways. The food was really good but lighter fare. This isn't a smoother your food in cheese kind of place. I heard folks raving about the shrimp special but we didn't get it.  Instead my husband ordered a steak dish and I got the fish. We shared a small bowl of Mexican beans. I think they should have given us each our own bowls. Nevertheless, the service was outstanding. I got a creme brulee for dessert, which was good but not great. I will return and make different choices.",

We went for the Mole an let me say it was worth it the flavor was powerful an rich, served with warm tortilla's i would go back just for that. We also got the pork marinated in an orange/ zesty type sauce fantastic! we decided for dessert an got a piece of Tres Leche to share; the piece was 5$ an so small we devoured it in a few bite's that was my only regret. If you're wanting authentic go here but beware the price may turn you off.",

Our waitress was nice, but service was slow; she could have used some help, I think.  I felt we got hustled with appetizers:  she didn't ask if we wanted them, she said \"I will bring you A and B,\" as if it was complimentary.  But they were good, and a nice variety, so okay.  Others in my group liked their food, but I was disappointed.  I ordered the night's special, a \"surf and turf\" combo with shrimp and rib eye steak.  The two large shrimp were bland and a little tough, and the steak was shoe leather.  I ordered it medium, but there was not a hint of pink or moisture in the meat.  I really needed a steak knife, but it was not provided.  On the other hand, the sides were good.  There was a corn salad that I could have eaten an entire bowl of, it was so delicious.  Also on the side was some good rice, small pieces of toast, and greens.   All fine.    This entree was $27.00, which was way way WAY overpriced for what I got, considering the quality.  Since my friends were pleased with their meals and the menu looked interesting, I might give them another chance if I'm in the area.",

    "text": "OK, we went to the \"new\" Asi Es La Vida last night after watching all of the sign changes and \"now open\" signs come and go over the last several months. Here's the scoop: the original owners sold it in June and it became La Taz de Oro or something like that for about 3 months, then those owners left and the original owners took it back. They were in Mexico in the fall and were delayed getting back to reopen Asi Es La Vida, plus they had to go through inspection processes all over again, so they didn't open until November, and here we are. And it is exactly the same as the last time I went! All that change, and nothing changed. Kind of funny.  I have one complaint. Before we went, I looked up their menu online and saw that it had changed dramatically from the last time we were there. I remembered fancy Mexican food with a high price tag, and the menu online boasts your more low-brow enchiladas and tacos fare for much lower prices. I thought, cool, a new neighborhood Tex-Mex joint that won't break the bank. But the menu is EXACTLY the same as before all of the changing of hands, the only change being that they brought all of the prices down about $2. So I don't get the online menu and they should definitely update that.   Anyway, the food is very good, as usual. High end Mexican. Still no chips or bread to start. And the weird TV-Dinner rice is still on the plate...they must have just called their old distributors when they reopened.   We shared the queso fundido with chorizo, which comes with corn tortillas and a variety of salsas. Excellente and spicy. Then I had a bowl of Crema de Cilantro, which was rich and creamy and almost smoky...would love to recreate at home. Entrees: I had a combo of mole and ropa vieja. The ropa was a tad on the salty side, which I like but others might not. The mole was superb. Hubby had a steak filet with chipotle sauce...he said it was excellent.  The service, as usual, was impeccable...they strive to make their customers feel like they are dining at the Ritz.   Oh, and now it is BYOB, so that's new.",

They make you feel like you are at home.  The food is very delicious I have tried most everything on the menu and have yet to find anything that I dislike.  There is live music everyday except for Wednesday, I believe; the music is played my one man and his guitar.  He always plays beautiful music and you can even request songs and if he knows them he will play them.  There are two seating areas in the restaurant one where the live music is played and the other is to the left as you walk in the door.  They are always specials of the day from the appetizers to the main entree.  I am a big fan of the Carne Tampiquena and my girlfriend loves a dish they will make if you request it, at the moment I am not sure of its name but it has fish and it is covered in a cream sauce, it too is very delicious.  While the live music is being played you will start to feel very relaxed and not rushed like some restaurants can make you feel.  They don't try to rush you, they want you to feel welcome and enjoy your time with them.  I like that you aren't served a bowl of chips and salsa like typical cheap mexican restaurant serve.  If you are thinking about going to this place I strongly recommend that you try it and you will fall in love with the atmosphere, food and the friendly people that work there.  Oh it is a little on the expensive side but worth every penny.  ENJOY!!!  I have been told that you can bring your own bottle of wine and seen some people bring their own because they don't have a liquor license yet.",

    "text": "it's a dose of mexican comfort food and hospitality.  i'm definitely not a mexican food connoisseur, but i definitely know fresh, tasty, and homemade food -- and this is where it's at!  conveniently located around the biltmore area, the restaurant is a pop of color on 24th street. you can't miss it!  for dinner, we didn't need reservations on a wednesday, and were greeted with warm, professional, and attentive service. the menu offers many traditional mexican plates of food (like the delish mole poblano i had), so don't be expecting any nachos, quesadillas, enchillada buffet (though i secretly wished they had some).  everything from the BYOB (with no corkage or additional charges), to the personal service, and the free-flow pour of aqua frescas (watermelon for me, yum!), was just so home-style and comfortable.   the food was no different - the guacamole, the tortillas, the mole sauce, and even dirty rice -- all tasted like it came from mama's kitchen.  there was enough depth of flavor for all dishes to be interesting, and enough simplicity to make it casual and easy to eat! (use your hands!) portions were just right, and coming from san francisco, all that food for under $50 was a steal!  definitely a go-to for the next biz trip to phx... gracias senorita!",

    "text": "We went here for the fabulous UYE. As the restaurant is often empty, Julia though it would be good to give them some business...but in the end it was our group that ended up being given the business. The words highway robbery come to mind, but I guess we weren't really on the highway. The prices listed on the menu really didn't seem that out of line, a bit on the pricey side but nothing alarming. Our waitress slyly sold us a kazillion dollars worth of appetizers that were not on the menu. We got 4 plates which consisted of 4 individual sauces with some stuff in them...one had shrimp, one had chicken, one had pork, and one had chihuahua. Oh wait, I think that was the cheese on top. Anyway, the plate with 4 tablespoons of sauce was not worth the $25...oh wait, we got 4 of them. The waitress also managed to slip two orders of guacamole in on us for $11 a piece. As far as the entrees are concerned, the portions were small and the food was kind of meh. The mole was way too sweet for my taste. The biggest bummer of all was NO BOOZE! The $120 worth of appetizers would have gone over much better if they were washed down with some frosty margaritas. A couple of pitchers and they could have slipped us some $100 flan.  Regardless of the price and the mediocre food, it was well worth going for the amazing company of the awesome Phoenix Yelpers. I don't think I would go back for the food though.",

    "text": "I would go to Asi if it were just me and another, because the decor is nice for intimate setting, in particular the fun guitar guy who is not too loud to drown out conversation and doesn't wander about the place, just plays lilting melodies, upping the ambiance considerably. This is responsible for one of their stars.  I might go to Asi with someone who speaks Spanish to be better assured of understanding that the order is right. Even with slow clear English it was hard to get a straight answer from our hostess regarding what something actually included. We thought we had communicated properly, but the charges at the end were a mind opener. We ordered one appetizer platter and four appeared.  I thought the normal (24.95) platter had been split among four plates as each plate had about 2T of  stews on it.  We asked and she said yes, this is how they do it with large parties, for sharing. In reality each plate was a separate full price platter. ..... $99 for 4 of these? OUCH. While the foods at Asi are pleasant, the prices are a little steep for the size or quantity received. If you are a large party,( we had 17) expecting to split checks, don't. Bring cash, they will only allow two credit cards to be used to pay and you'll have to split out your own check.  Back to the food: I ordered the leg of lamb, but my lamb was cubed and buried under a thickened tomato based sauce, not explained on the menu. It was decent flavoring, but not what I was expecting. My partner got the \"especial\". The Shrimp was flayed open, large and fresh, the steak medium rare and free of too much fat, but again covered in a tomato sauce. As we both can't handle too much acid, that lowered our joy. The vegetable was corn and onions in sour cream.  I thought my $20 entree included a salad, but this is only a tomato and a slice of lettuce on the side of my plate. I consider those Mexican garnishes, not salads. The sauces that came to the table were really yummy and were good on the homemade tortilla chips and guac. This was all at the UYE event that Julie so graciously organized and while we enjoyed the guitar player and munchies and our company, we left with a sour taste at the bill (434.00, not including tip) and the way things were poorly explained by the hostess (the chips/guac was not complimentary either it was $8 a plate and they brought four of those too without being asked for multiples). Another star would have been given if there weren't such unfortunate (and not corrected by the restaurant, nothing comped or made clear until too late) billing issues. So if you go, be very clear with your order, prepare with cash just in case, order some flavored waters, enjoy the guitar guy and watch out for misunderstandings.",

We were brought 4 platters at $24.95 each.  ----NO BOOZE!!!    ----NO BYOB!!!   So the \"value\" part of this restaurant totally sucks.   My combination of the pork something and the mole, which were good but not great, were incredibly small portions for $17.95.  I seriously did not have enough meat in the mole sauce for a single taco. Weak. Beans were average. Rice was tasty, but like another reviewer said I think they used frozen vegetables.  I think the Guacamole was $10.95!  It's kinda a nice place, but the prices are easily 2 to 3 time higher than what they should be.   I'll go to Barrio Cafe and not this place from now on.",

I was so astounded by its typically Phoenician style of unassuming-slash-surprisingly-cool that I asked the waitress how long the restaurant had been there. I expected her to say a couple of years or something.  Try 20. For two decades this place has sat here and Mr Wannabe Expert on Dining Out in Phoenix had no idea it existed. I bow my head in shame.   An old Mexican man strummed his guitar to a quiet folk song as we enjoyed our lunch on a weekday. The food was tasty and just a touch less fatty and greasy than regular Sonoran food. The 3 varieties of salsa were good, as was the guac we ordered with our chips.   A business colleague of mine from Houston will be in town for a few hours in a couple of weeks, just enough time for us to grab lunch. I'm bringing him here.",

I actually never paid attention to the building before, it was just one of the many I passed on my way to work.  I walked in, looked to my right and saw into the kitchen. Huh? It was really clean, but I kept walking and made my way to the bar/dining area. The set up and entry is a bit confusing your first time there, but the next time it won't be a problem. The server was unbelievably nice and helpful. He showed me the lunch menu, and helped me pick something out. I went in to get my food to go around 1:30 PM and one other couple came in while I was waiting.  Then this guy came in and started playing guitar and singing in Spanish. He was fantastic! He even sang Sweet Caroline in Spanish. Neil Diamond in Espanol; I love it! The server even got me ice water while I was waiting. I was so relaxed and enjoying myself while I was waiting that I was a little sad when my food came, and I had to leave.   OH yeah, the food turned out to be delicious too! This is not the Sonoran Mexican fare we are genuinely used to in AZ, this is more like Mexico City cuisine I've been told by my Mexican friends. People who are looking for the standard chips and salsa fare may be a little confused. If you are not looking for that, this place has wonderful food and atmosphere. I won't be able to eat lunch there all the time, due to budget, but I will definitely be back. I want to hear more of my American favorites sung in Spanish too. I wonder if he knows any Britney songs?",

They did not have a liquor license, but I can't dock any stars for that if they let you BYOB and no one advertised it for its drinks.  Although I must tell you that bar tender looked pretty lonely at his empty bar polishing his glasses all night.  I was told the liquor license thing is an on again off again thing for them.  They insisted on pouring the wine we brought in, even though no one there could tell a Chardonnay from a Pinot Noir.",

    "text": "There are only a coupl'a things that prevent me from giving this place one more star.   1.  I thought their guacamole was way overpriced at 8.00 and not at all like the guacamole I've had prepared fresh at my table for the same price.    2.  I ordered the agua fresca in watermelon (which was delicious, by the way), but my friend ordered the pineapple one and hers tasted like colored water.  Seriously.  It was like night and day in comparing the two drinks.  When I took a sip, I was surprised they would even bring it out.  When we pointed out the weak flavor, the server only was able to suggest the watermelon like I had.  Hmm....  So I was here on the 13th and thought their food was actually pretty good.  It was far better than what I could get in the DC area after living in CA all my life and having the luxury of choosing a different awesome Mexican restaurant for every day of the week.  We didn't get any other appetizer, but the salsas that came with the guacamole were outstanding.  I ordered a sampler plate that consisted of a pork simmered in orange juice and the ropa vieja.  Both dishes were really tasty and I enjoyed them veyr much.  My friend ordered the appetizer sampler plate.  I don't recall exactly what was on it, but I do remember taking a bite of the chicken mole, which was done very nicely.  We were there pretty early, so we were the first customers to arrive.  While were were there, a couple was seated nearby.  I didn't see anyone else after that.  The atmosphere is lively and cozy at the same time.  Lots of care went into decorating it, as there are many personal touches.  There is a parking lot behind the restaurant, which beats having to find a spot on the street.  I will be back in Phoenix in December...I hope they have their liquor license by then!  A margarita or a beer would make the meal complete and then I would give it that extra star!",

First of all the decor was very charming and I really did like it, the way to get to the table was a little weird but it wasn't a deal breaker. The food however was a deal breaker. I ordered the Enmoladas and the mole was way too sweet and it was not made from scratch. My mom ordered a dish called Cesina, it was a very thin cut of steak (which granted it does say thinly cut in the menu). The taste of the steak was a very unenthusiastic \"ok\" but the plate came with some chilaquiles and that sauce used in that was definitely from cans. The rice looked and tasted like minute rice. We Mexicans do not eat this puffy looking wet rice! It was the weirdest thing I've ever been served at a Mexican restaurant. I have NEVER been served rice like this. The chips served with the guacamole were actually tostadas broken up and they were store bought tostadas. The guacamole was ok. I hate not being able to support a local restaurant but this was just laughable. It was definitely not getting my money's worth. If I wanted to eat the food they served I could have done so with a lot less money. Won't be coming back ever.",

The mole enchiladas are TO DIE FOR! So so good. Their micheladas are delicious as well.

    "text": "There's no missing the vibrant pink building that is Asi Es La Vida. The restaurant has been on my foodie radar since I saw them featured on an episode of Check, Please! Arizona. Inside is quaint (which is the nice way of saying it is small but not in a bad way, more in the cozy way) and filled with Frida decor.   We were promptly greeted and asked our preference of table. A booth was available so we opted for that. After spending earlier in the day walking around, I was thirsty. They offer a few different flavors of Aguas Frescas (pina, melon, sandia). I went with the sandia (watermelon). It was not overly sweet like some Agua Frescas can be. It was very light and refreshing like drinking straight watermelon.  For an appetizer we got guacamole. Even though I prefer a slightly more acidic guac, we still managed to eat the plate clean. The guacamole came with three salsas (and extra chips). My favorite of the three salsas was the green tomatillo - medium heat and great flavor.   For my entree I had the Cochinita Pibil. The menu description is: slow roasted pork with an orange based sauce and sweet red onion. The dish is super tangy and citrusy. Since I am a fan of those flavors, I was very happy. I also sampled bites of the mole and tinga and would have easily ate a plate of all three if that was an option.   Before you leave, don't forget to use your Yelp check-in for a free dessert. We were brought flan. Which I typical do not like (it's a textural thing). It would not have been my first choice...or my choice at all but asi es la vida. I was pleasantly surprised to have actually enjoyed this flan so that's saying something.   If you are in the neighborhood, find the bright pink building and enjoy some great Mexican food.",

Decor is dark and warm, Frida Kahlo portraits throughout.  The staff was fantastic some at the table were unsure about some unfamiliar sauces so our server brought out a sample for us to try.  We started with Queso Fundido which was a fantastic flavor rich and savory.  We all just ordered a bunch of dishes and we all shared, Cameron shrimp baked with garlic and oil (not my favorite) it was okay the shrimp was a bit dry ironically enough, Filet chipotle was fantastic topped with chihuahua cheese and aioli sauce, cooked a little too medium for my taste but still very good! Crepes de Cameron, shrimp crepes with garlic topped with a chardonnay cream sauce AMAZING! You owe it to yourself to try it and forget what we think of as Mexican food in AZ!",

    "text": "I'm always pushing my girlfriend to try new restaurants, especially Mexican ones. Unfortunately, they often end up being poor choices and we angrily regret not going with an established favorite that we know won't disappoint. However, every once in a blue moon, we'll stumble upon a place that we wrongfully assume is just another generic Mexican joint, which ends up exceeding our expectations. Asi Es La Vida is one of those rare places.  The restaurant itself is very small, tastefully decorated, and has a great atmosphere, complimented by live (but not loud) music during the evenings.  Their guacamole is one of my personal favorites due to its simplicity and high quality. They provide you with a limited amount of tostadas, but don't fret, as they always bring more out later.  For dinner, we've had the Enrollado de Res, which is a sirloin stuffed with three different cheeses and covered in a chipotle sauce. I took a risk ordering this, having never had it before. It was excellent and has since become my favorite thing on their menu thus far. My girlfriend usually goes for a mole and cochinita pibil combo, which she is consistently pleased with.  I've also had their \"Filete,\" which is a filet mignon that's topped with cheese, onions, peppers, and garlic. I usually scoff at the mere mention of putting anything on a filet, but I actually ended up enjoying the way it was prepared.    Keep in mind, if you check in on Yelp, you can get one of their (cheaper) desserts for free. We've had both the tres leches and flan. Both were good, but there's a reason why they're willing to give them away freely. The slices are so small that two people can easily devour it within seconds. If they were any smaller, they would be classified as free samples on a toothpick.  I am sometimes taken back by some of their prices and also find it very odd that their parking lot is often full, even when there's practically no one inside the restaurant. Is there something going on upstairs that I don't know about?  Food wise though, we're big fans and I find the experience to be quite unique in comparison to most Mexican places in Phoenix.  Highly recommended!",

This is a nice little place on 24th street with great decor and friendly service.  I cannot wait to return and try more items out on the menu along with maybe a friendly margarita.",

The menu is not the standard Tex-Mex tacos and burros; rather it is Central Mexican cuisine. The chipotle sauce is smoky with a nice hot finish, the tomatillo sauce is bright with a great flavor. The bar is well stocked with 65 tequilas, the Marquita's are made with fresh squeezed lime juice. Every bite was a pleasant surprise. I cannot wait to come back for dinner.",

We haven't been when its been very busy -which makes me sad, as I'd like to see the place with a line out the door - but this kind of adds to the charm because you're almost guaranteed to have a nice relaxing lunch or dinner.  I really enjoy the atmosphere too!  The bright colors and busy walls are distinct and its very small and cozy.    The food - I've had maybe 5 or 6 different things off of the menu and have never been disappointed.  I'm not a big mole fan but I still really enjoy it there.  Everything is bursting with different flavors.  Don't get me started on the watermelon water - I probably average 4 glasses each time.  I just can't stop myself!  It is so refreshing!",

This place was good, I don't really have any complaints at all, but was it memorable, great, and would I really have an urge to go back, not necessarily. It was definitely more fancy than I was expecting given the other reviews. They try to make it have an upscale, date-night kind of feel, and that's cool, especially if you take advantage of the BYOBooze, w/out a fee. Something I was not aware of, but wish I was! The fresh guac that is offered is not complimentary, but it is good and well worth it.   The menu is not chalk full of the usual enchiladas, chimi's, etc, but some fancier (maybe more traditional) Mexican entrees. I had a sirloin that was stuffed with three different cheeses, spinach, bacon, and covered in a tomato based sauce of some sort. I was a little disappointed in the lack of rich complex flavors given the players of ingredients, but again, it wasn't bad by any means. My gf had some vegetable type enchiladas that she said were very good, but we both had the same conclusion. It was good, nothing to complain about, but nothing great either.",

Yes portions are on the smaller side but the food/taste really made up for it.  We then had their flan for dessert and oh man it's exactly what flan should taste like.

    "text": "Went for dinner this time, date, perfect. My honie is so sweet, he doesn't make a fuss about the price, but honestly, that's why this place is empty. You can tell they tried to lower the prices; but people in AZ just don't pay $15 a plate anymore.  The upside is that the prices ensure you'll get a table and plenty of attention by the staff.  Another bummer and why there are only 4 stars: The last time we went there were margarita's...now it's bring your own bottle of wine. (~hope there's not some weird political mischief taking away their liquor license; everything in AZ business is soooo wild west). I wish we would have known, we would have brought a bottle.  I wanted to try the lamb, but went with a pork dish instead -Had pickled onions sliced thin on top...an amazing Mexican stew; and the usual rice and beans [that some lady below didn't like]. It's white rice tossed with a little cilantro and finely chopped veggies; simple, healthy.   John had a beef steak dish; a house specialty. He had them cook it med, rare so I would try some, but he probably should have ordered it rare for his own enjoyment. It was very tender none-the-less.  We had cantaloupe juice last time, which inspired us to try to make cantaloupe margaritas at home (we're no good at these things I guess)...so this time I had pineapple and he had watermelon. The juices are perfect to clean your palate from the rich flavors of the food.  We love their sour green sauce, but then I'm a fanatic for tomatillos [green sour tomatoes].  The Guacamole was exactly the same as it was at lunch. They serve it on a plate, with homemade tortilla chips, spiking up from the guacamole like a rocky shoreline on a green sea. The chips are heartier than the thin and oily homemade tortilla chips you get elsewhere here; they have strong texture, no oil and lightly salted.   I prefer the quality of the food here to the greasy food elsewhere. There's no lard, no grease and everything is cooked to perfection. Not overcooked. However, we won't go here often, b/c my boyfriend never lets me pay for these things and we're not particularly affluent.",

The mole is to die for.  It is so rich and deep in flavors and I get excited just writing about it.  I've ordered it many times.  I've also had their cochinita pibil which melts in your mouth it is so tender, juicy, and a tornado of flavors in your mouth.  I've also had the adobada and what more can I say ... it's just so good.  I especially love their fruit juices because you can see it being made from an actual fruit, cantaloupe, pineapple, watermelon, etc.  So fresh and refreshing!  Price might be a tad high for the little things that I've noticed but when my palate was having a climax for almost 2 hours everytime ... I think it's worth it.  :-)",

We sat down and got our menu's, it was the dinner menu and WAY too expensive for us - we thought about leaving just then but decided to order drinks and an appetizer (oh yea, no drink menu so I guess you have to wait for the bill to see how much the drinks were), but then the waitress (who was very nice) suggested the lunch menu - much better but still priced a little high. We passed on the chips and salsa appetizer deal she told us about that was for 4.. priced at $18 (ummm no). So we decided to order... she took my order first and then took my girlfriends order - then she walked away, not taking the orders from either of our husbands (well okay, guess we are sharing then). So the food arrived, quite quickly, but the serving size was smaller than what I expected for the price and not really a meal you would usually share. The food was very good and full of flavor though.  We probably won't go back to this place with all the strange issues we had and the prices are just a little too high, especially considering the huge number of competing Mexican restaurants.",

I was just happening by on my way to the airport from N Phoenix and saw this listed on \"Yelp Reviews\" for restaurants around me and though I'd check it out.  I was well received and the climate of the staff was very pleasant. My food came within a reasonable amount of time although I was the only one of two seated in the restaurant.  I ordered a watermelon juice (real watermelon juice) on ice which was sweet and refreshing to begin with and the waiter recommended the lunch item that was a top sirloin skirt marinated, ride beans and some kind of layered tortilla bake with cheese and tomato salsa. They also brought out 3 ramadans of  Pico De Giulio, a smokey chipotle and tomatillo sauce.   The steak was tender and all the sides were unbelievably delicious.  Lastly I ordered a vanilla Ice Cream Crepe covered in caramel sauce and it was one of the best deserts I have ever eaten.  With everything including the tip my meal came to $25.00 for lunch.  for the quality of the food it was worth the price if it were a dinner, but 25.00 lunches are for me a little over the top.  So although the food was terrific, the pricing was not.",

I mixed the chipotle & the pico... to die for. My friend, who normally perfers a milder pallet enjoyed it too. She raved about the guacamole, said it was even better than hers. And she's the expert.   Be sure to start with one of their traditionally Hispanic juices. We had both a glass of the Watermelon & the Cantalope. We were wondering if they would mix juices; our waiter overheard & yes they can.   My friend started with Cream of Cilantro soup, which turned out to be delicious and the serving size was substantial. Then she had a salad with chicken. On her first bite she paused and savored. We both did a lot of that.  I order a beef dish that was new to me. It was thinly sliced, yet still succulent and such a flavor! The plate also contained refried bean, rice and some killer chilequiles.   A couple of notes - I asked the waiter what region the food was from because the beef reminded me of the food of Jalisco & while the chilequiles seemed pure Sonoran. He said it was from a region south of La Ciuidad de Mexico.  - the restaurant currently has to no liquor license, but you can bring in beer and wine. The new owners are in the process of applying for one.  - the name \"Asi Es La Vida\" if translated word for word would be \"This is the Life\" however in colloquial Spanish it mean \"Such is life\" or \"That's how the world is\" LOL  Unfortunately I live in Gilbert, but I'll be back.",

This is not your run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant but an upscale bistro designed to excite the senses with delightful aromas of spices. The waiter who served us was polite, efficient and helpful as he explained all the choices.  The parking lot is small but probably adequate so long as some of the customers park on the street. This may not be the cheapest Mexican restaurant in town, and it's definitely not the most expensive, but you will definitely feel that the cost of your meal will be worth it.  Go, indulge, enjoy and appreciate this local establishment.",

I had the Cesina thin grilled steak served with chiqules rice and frijoles delicious. My wife had tortilla soup and the crepes di Cameron my daughter enjoyed the enchiladas with white cream sauce.

The building really doesn't look like much during the day, but at night, it comes alive with great food and service, wow!  Our waiter was fun and did a great job of taking care of us, including starting our group off with Mexico City sangrias. So delicious! And, to his credit, he warned us that they would go down like Kool-Aid. I have to disagree. Kool-Aid doesn't even come close to the delicious taste of these Sangrias (yes, that is plural--yep, more than one). I guess he didn't say they tasted like Kool-Aid, only that they'd go down like Kool-Aid. I guess he was right.  We started by sharing a plate of guacamole. Yummy. Great flavor and the tomatillo sauce was incredible! For my entree, I had the sea bass, which was simply wonderful (melt-in-your-mouth wonderful), and what a great ingredient, the green olives in the sauce, just the right amount of kick. Nice presentation of the food, too!  We did the Yelp check-in offer of a free dessert, which we shared four ways (no guilt there). The next day, we all wondered if we hadn't had the Sangrias would the food had tasted so delicious? We all agreed the answer was YES.",

Expect Chilean sea bass, perfectly-cooked tampequena, and delicious mole sauces.  Service was amazing; we received personal attention that you'd find at high-end restaurants around the Valley with twice the price tags.  We also were serenaded through our dinner, with live guitar right near our table.  100% recommend the Mexico City Sangria.  Wowza, that drink packs a punch.  Our table guacamole was freshly-made and served with a variety of salsas which alone were worth the cost of the guacamole.  I had the tampequena, which was delicious, but also sampled multiple other meals around our table.  You probably can't go wrong.  Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free dessert!",

    "text": "My companion and I stopped by Asi Es La Vida during our visit to the greater Phoenix area. I actually really loved the restaurant! The restaurant's vibrant color of the building and the cozy, intimate ambiance inside was super cute. Really a good place for a casual, non stuck up date or with friends/family in a non pretentious environment for sure.  I had the pork Farlolitos and my companion had a tortilla soup and a recalentado. We also shared salsa+guac and chips for appetizer. I loved my meal..very light and tasty. My companion liked his meal too...although after we left...he told me he actually preferred my dish than what he ordered (I tried his dish too and I agreed with that statement!). We also go tres leche and flan (flan was complementary from a yelp check in) and I loved both desserts. Overall, nothing much to complain about. We were there during lunch, so it wasn't so crowded. But I think if you plan to go there for dinner, it's best to make a reservation ahead of time (the restaurant isn't so big...so theres a chance you may have to wait without any reservation).  Overall, I would love to come to this cute place foran authentic Mexican meal again. I'm typically not a Mexican food lover (due to the fact that I think that food at most Mexican restaurants is heavy and made me feel so sluggish post-meals). But I do make an exception for this restaurant. Food tasted light and healthy...desserts werent too sweet...and the ambiance was super cute. I would love to come here again.  The only minus is that their lunch menu selection is smaller than their dinner menu. I actually was eyeing for one particular dish durung our lunch stop..but was told they only serve that during dinner. Oh well, maybe next time I'm in the area..I will get to dine here again during dinner!",

We ordered the sampler appetizer that was delicious. Try as much as you can it's all good. And their fresh juices are good too. The Mole is hands down some of the best I've tasted. They have Guisados that are stews, Yummy! The Pescado a la Veracruzana is also very good. I'm so happy that this place is so close! We will be back often!!   It's a family owned business and it shows that they put their heart into it! Do yourself a favor and go!! The service is as good as the food! Enjoy!!",

    "text": "Hands down the best Mexico City Mexican food in the valley and that comes from someone that has eaten at many local establishments. We'll get to that in a bit.  You just can't miss this place. It is just north of Osborn the on 24th Street. If you miss it I would be amazed as it is the brightest, pinkest, restaurant I have ever seen. What you would assume was the front door is actually locked because of the live music they have I believe 5 nights a week. The music isn't loud and will not disrupt your evening at all, but adds the perfect ambiance for what will be a dancing tongue of joy you will be feeling shortly.  We sit at the bar 90% of the time and like with most family establishments we get to know the employees quickly. We have met two of the sons, I believe the only daughter and the mother who helps out in the kitchen.  This will presently surprise you as the Mexico City Mexican Restaurant has white table clothes and the decor sets a perfect mood.  Finally to the food... I am a mole snob period. I won't name other names on this review but know that there are many varieties of mole depending on the state that you are visiting so there probably really isn't a \"True best mole\" unless you are comparing it to the state in which it derived from. This, however, is my favorite so far on this planet...  Then I found their cochinita and that literally changed my life. I can now fully endorse not only their mole but now my favorite cochinita ever.  I always grab a cerveza when I am there but my wife will snag either their sangria (little splash of vodka added, my wife says it's unbelievable) or their margarita. I highly suggest sitting at the bar if the daughter is there and asking her to just say margarita for you... it is awesome the way she says it.  I cannot highly recommend this place enough... so much that we are debating getting the cochinita 2 days before Turkey Day so we can enjoy it on that day.  Lastly, I am not a dessert guy... just not my thing... but have had a bite of their flan which I saw another patron wait patiently for an entire pie to bring home for a party he was hosting... asked him what he thought of it and thought it was the best he had ever had... he then asked for a slice for him alone for that evening as the dinner party wasn't for a few days :)  Again ask the daughter to say \"margarita\" for you :)",

You can't go wrong with any option on there menu, if you go for lunch you can ask to see the dinner menu and if your not in a rush they will accommodate you by making something off the dinner menu.

You park in the back even though that's where the entrance is.  Their front entrance is actually blocked from the inside.  It's interesting because you walk through a front lobby area, through a door, down a hallway, past the kitchen and then into the dining area.  The place is small but very quaint and decorated nicely.  It's actually quite romantic as the night we were there, there was a guitarist singing some beautiful Spanish tunes.  We learned they have live music Thursday through Sunday.    I ordered a shrimp dish which came with a toasted baguette, rice and this amazing corn concoction.   The shrimp were butterflied and were quite large.  I enjoyed every bite.  We also ordered the chorizo fundido cheese dip and that was amazing.  I could've eaten 2 more plates of those.  For dessert, I received a free dessert by checking in to Yelp.  I had their flan and loved it.  The bonus was their watermelon drink had free refills!  There was nothing I disliked here.  Service was great, food was fantastic.  I want to take the hubs here next time for our date night.",

    "text": "Took the other half here on a whim after randomly driving past this unique looking restaurant the previous day. Boy! Am I happy I made the decision to give this place a chance! I ordered the 'filete chipotle' which is a cut of filet mignon served over a small tortilla and melted cheese and topped with a perfectly flavored chipotle sauce. I was worried the sauce was going to overpower the steak however, I was wrong. The sauce perfectly complimented the perfectly prepared cut of beef!   She ordered the 'filete Asi Es La Vida' which is a filet mignon again served over a tortilla with melted cheese and topped with grilled onions, poblano peppers and garlic. Both steaks were perfectly prepared, were very consistent in terms of texture and perfectly hit the spot!  Both entrees were served with a side of rice and black beans which were also quite delicious. We ended the night with a slice of flan, which also tasted amazing!   Do yourself a favor and give this place a try. It's the perfect atmosphere for a date night and they even had live music while I was there. Fair warning that the place is pretty small so arrive early or make reservations. The service was also quite impressive. High quality food and excellent top notch service for not a bad price! Both of our entrees were only $28! I'm happy. She's happy. My wallet is happy. Most of all, my stomach was happy! I WILL return in the near future to try their lunch menu, which looked a lot more relaxed(tacos, enchiladas, chilaquiles etc.). Give this place a try! You will NOT be disappointed! Mark my words! Provecho!",

The guisado stews are delicious. The cochinita pibil is amazing.  Very quaint. It feels like this may have been a house previously, which makes the layout a little funky. They often have a guy playing guitar softly near the bar area / very romantic. The Frida artwork on the walls is a nice touch too. It's not cheap but then again this isn't a -berto's place. Would be a good place for a first date, or to take out-of-town visitors to. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "If you want to experience Mexican food that differs from the Sonoran and Tex-Mex versions you know, this is the place to go. Asi Es La Vida serves \"regional Mexican food.\" Our party of three shared the thick, flavorful chips and delicious guacamole and split a dessert of ice cream filled crepe topped with warm caramel sauce. Our luncheon selections were individualized, except when one of our group, who grimaced when another ordered Crema de Cilantro soup, tasted his and decided to duplicate his order. Her dislike of cilantro was overcome because it didn't overpower the other flavors in the soup. Each entree was a pleasantly unique dining treat. They included Adobada, Enmoladas, and Chicken Sincronizadas.  Service was prompt, courteous, friendly, and efficient.  We liked the decor and art on display.   I had been here 20-some years ago when it first opened and East Coast friends took me there after reading a rave review in the New York Times. We gave it raves, too. But life intervened and I didn't get back. Over the years, as I occasionally drove by, I was put off by its garish external transformation. I'm glad I read the recent New Times back story about this restaurant and decided to return. And, now, I'll be back with some frequency.",

The beans were cold, but the food was good otherwise.    We had a nice time, and when the bill came were in a rush to get back to work.  We noticed the bill was significantly higher than expected.  When we asked our waitress why, we discovered THE SUPPOSED COMPLIMENTARY (WE HAD NOT ASKED FOR THEM) SMALL CHIPS AND GUACAMOLE WERE $10.95!!  We did not have time to address the management, which I would normally do in this case.  The waitress did not apologize, and confirmed there was not a sign or note that informed us the chips and guacamole were mandatory and not complimentary.",

This is not a large chain restaurant  but a small intimate family owned establishment that still accommodated us.  Our service was exceptional and very attentive.  This is not your typical  Mexican food that is here but rather Mexican cuisine that you would see in Mexico City or even in Oaxaca.  Everything we head from the appetizer sampler to our dinners was fantastic.  Nothing microwaved everything very fresh and cooked to perfection. Three  of us had the special which was Gulf Shrimp wrapped in Bacon and grilled  was excellent and not over cooked. The other three in our party had three different steak dinners  Felete \"Asi Es La Vida\" , Carne Tampiqueria, and  the  New York Strip all said cooked  perfectly.  Everyone was too full to have any dessert.  Very nice touch to the evening was the live music a single guitarist  playing Spanish music and singing.

This nickel & dime-ing by the restaurant manager really put us in a bad mood.  The service was good (not the server fault) and the food came out fast enough.     We order the Chips & Guac, Chicken Salad & Enfrijoladas (I think).  The food was decent. The total bill for 2 lunch with tips came out to about $31 and that includes the $2 charges for 2 bottle water.  Congrats to the manager for forced selling bottle waters to the customers.

Ordered the guacamole to start-very fresh & tasty. The chips were tostada chips which is better-sturdier chips for the guacamole. Three types of salsa was given: tomatillo, chipotle & pico. All very flavorful. In order the Chilaqulies w/pork. Very delicious, I was surprised that is a pork steak instead of shredded pork. My co-worker ordered the Enfriolada-the black bean sauce was yummy according to her. We also tried their fruit waters-watermelon & pineapple, both refreshing! Service was awesome, attentive & friendly. This place is definitely a must visit again to try other items.",

Four stars only because this is my first and probably my only visit for a long time (since I was just passing through). Otherwise, I'm sure they'd be worth five stars in my book and will return of I'm ever in the area.",

Chicken was flavorful and melted in my mouth. The pinto beans and rice that accompanied the chicken were delicious as well. My friends enjoyed their meals too. One order Enrollado de Res and the other a Ropa Vieja/Tinga combination.   The gentleman at the bar explained how everything is freshly prepared on site with the exception of the tortillas. They cut their own meat and are happy to serve those with dietary restrictions. Their lunch and dinner menus are different, I cannot wait to go back!",

Frida Kahlo themed and beautiful, with a tasteful vibrance that is both exciting and calming at the same time.

We decided to stop by for lunch with a few compadres from the office.  The moment you park in the back and walk in you know toto would be saying we are not in Phoenix anymore but he would say donde estamos aka as where are we?  This place is an interesting spot and the experience was beyond my expectations.    I want to come back as soon as we can make it to a margarita kind of night simply because they have a great array of tequilas and the food was spot on during my visit.  You have to respect a Mexican spot that has a very small menu, this means confidence!  They have a great Agua Fresca selection that they will continue to refill for you.  Our table tried all different plates and they were awesome.. I recommend their chilaquiles.    Finish off with a great flan and you will quickly realize why you never came here knowing it was here all along..   If you can uncover what is upstairs, please do so as it leaves me wanting to sneak in and find out.",

After reading other reviews, I knew better than to accept their \"offer\" of chips and guacamole.  I think it's strange that they would charge people for that when it's not even listed on the menu as an option.  Also, when they brought out chips and salsa prior to our meal, they literally gave us a PLATE that had maybe 6-8 chips on it!  Really??  Thumbs down for that!  I guess if you're not ordering the chips and guac you're just SOL.  However, the food was really good!  I had the verde enchiladas, and the verde sauce was great!  My friend ordered the conchita (sp?) with mole sauce.  She loved it!  We both had the watermelon juice and it was delish and very refreshing.    They also have a \"check-in\" offer from Yelp, that will get you a free dessert, which we used.  The default dessert must be flan, because that's what she automatically brought out to us.  It was good, but not great.  At the end of the day, I'm a foodie, so I'll put up with some \"extra\" stuff to have some good eats!",

    "text": "This unique Mexican restaurant is one of a kind and definitely deserves some praise. My husband and I have been dining at Asi Es La Vida, at least weekly, for about 2 years now. We first found this local treasure when looking for somewhere to lunch on the one day a week Morgan works from home. Thanks to wonderful reviews on Yelp and it's proximity to our home, we settled on Asi Es La Vida. When we entered, a waitress immediately sat us at the corner booth. The bright interior was decorated with multiple beautiful, paintings of Frida Kahlo and enough colorful adornments to keep you visually stimulated for the duration of your meal.   Our waitress came over immediately to say hello and let us know a little about the menu. With a nice selection of homemade aguas frescas to choose from, I figured the watermelon sounded like a good choice. My husband was sad that he chose tea after trying my delicious beverage. It was light, sweet and just what it claimed to be....simply watermelon juice. It was perfect! Figuring we had an hour for my hubby's lunch break and wanted to enjoy this new restaurant find, it seemed only necessary to order an appetizer. The waitress suggested their guacamole and homemade, white corn tortilla chips. Soon we were presented with a small and perfectly portioned appetizer that came with pico de gallo, a mild green salsa and a roasted, spicier salsa as accompaniments. It was exactly my type of appetizer! I love to mix stuff together and create each individual bite to be a bit unique. This can be dangerous, however, as I tend to end up making a mess.  We each ordered a torta; I chose the avocado and cheese, while Morgan went for the adobada. My torta was delicious, served on a lightly toasted roll dusted with a delicate white cheese. I can only assume my husband's was as flavorful and fresh as mine, since he was suddenly quiet and did not return his torta to his plate. Then.... it was gone! I looked down, and so was mine!! This was defiantly a good sign. Throughout the meal, our waitress remained attentive to our needs. When she offered us the tres leches or flan as desert, we declined only because our little bellies were already full and happy. We happily paid our tiny bill (less than $25) and have been eating at Asi Es La Vida ever since.",

It had EXTRAORDINARY straying power, much like the leather on my 15 year old Doc Martens. Couldn't do it. Even ordered it on the rare side of medium rare so that it couldn't be over flame thrown.    As we were getting ready to go, our check was grossly out of whack, price-wise. Here's why... As we were waiting to order, Irving asked us if we would like some guacamole to go with our chips. Sure, I said. We ordered a bowl, which was small, perhaps 6 oz. That bowl ran $13 on the check. Notice that it isn't on the menu.  Never again. Ever. EVER.",

    "text": "Best Sangria I have ever had!  I was with a friend and we were in the area and hungry so I used yelp to search something nearby and ended up here.  Pricey? Yes, quite so... I'm never really in the habit of checking the price rating for Mexican food places but I will definitely do so from now on. The price is the reason for the four star rating. I feel they should have larger portions for the price.  The food was great. I had chicken soup, it was tasty. We shared a chef's special which that night was lamb. It was very good as well. We had the pastel de tres leches and it was fantastic.   The service was great! The server was right on top of everything and took some time to explain the menu items and give us recommendations. We got there just before their closing time and they didn't rush us at all the entire time we were there.  This a great date place. Look forward to coming here next time with husband.",

Wow, we were NOT disappointed, not by the great authentic food, nor by the warm and hospitable service provided by Irving, a class act of courteous and professional service. Wish we had this restaurant and Irving in OUR neighborhood in LA ! Next time in Phoenix, will definitely be back",

    "text": "That's life.  I really dug this place.  It was different.  Upscale, but not fancy.  Great Mexican food without a single taco or burrito.  Apparently, it's more like the cuisine of Mexico City, instead of the the Sonoran Mexican food we typically eat... but what do I know?  The defining feature of this place is blindingly pink building in a not-so-great neighborhood.  (It's not a bad neighborhood, but it's a contrast from the luxuries just a few miles North on Camelback.)  Inside, the place feels like a collection of narrow, cozy hallways, and the place settings at the tables are elaborate.  We started with a margarita and a fresh watermelon juice.  The margarita was a little too strong, but the watermelon juice was refreshing.  We started with guacamole.  I heard it was made table-side, but I got duped on that one.  The chips were very thick, like tostadas.  The guacamole, salsa, and pico were all good, but not special.  Next, we had a shrimp appetizer, served over a crepe.  The cream sauce was unexpectedly amazing!  I was trying to sop up the remains with tortilla chips.  It was foreshadowing of things to come... this place knows its sauces.  For the entree, we split a steak dish.  The steak was pounded thin, marinated, and grilled.  It was tender and delicious, but the sides were the stars.  There was a folded chicken enchilada in a mole sauce that was out of this world!  The rice, and the bean-stuffed pepper were also nice accompaniments.  (Next time, I think I'll just order the mole.)  We also had dessert, another crepe filled with ice cream and topped with a tequila carmel sauce.  The sauce was delicious.  Unfortunately, the cold ice cream made the crepe a little gummy and hard to eat.  The waiter was friendly and attentive.  The prices of everything except the entrees were very reasonable.  (The entrees are a little on the high side.)  If you want a different, upscale Mexican experience, this is the place for you.  Great date spot,too.",

The camaron al mojo is the sirloin, it was decent but not too special.  i would recommend someone to come if they haven't had Mexican fishes before.

Again the sauces were fresh and homemade.  The beans were excellent as well.  Even the rice was different than what I have found in other Mexican restaurants.  It was white instead of yellow rice with vegetables as an accent.  I would definitely go back when in the area.",
