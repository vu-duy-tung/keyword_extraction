In a word the customer experience was substandard.  \"Joseph\" the waiter was not particularly friendly or responsive...Whatever caused his bad day should not have impacted the service provided.  The food was not good at all....two of us had chicken enchiladas...dry, tasteless, with a smear of sauce...black beans and rice had no seasoning at all...so bland.  I asked for more sauce for my enchilada and the server never brought it...apologize for forgetting...although I did see him quickly fulfill the request of a neighboring table for guacamole.  Two things were okay with this experience...the little bridge walkway from the parking lot was great for pictures and when I went to the bar to get surprise Patron shots for us...the bartender was a bit more friendly....Although \"Joseph\" did condescendingly let me know...\"you do know that I can get your drink orders'...in which I wanted to say \"Yes...I've been to many restaurants and remember how it works and you would be required to have checked back often enough for me to to have place my order with you\".

Around 6:30 on a Thursday, they were running full. I would have loved to sit outside on the patio because the weather was so perfect, but we just opted for the first available seats, which were inside. My friend was hungry, so she ordered the Aunt Chilada dip (refried beans, sour cream, guac, and ground beef), and some drinks from the bar. Nothing stellar so far. The waitress came to take our orders as soon as we sat down. I got the Tacos de Pescado, my friends got flautas and tamales. We got salsa and chips to start with. The order came really fast, while we were still finishing our starters. I liked my tacos, though I wish the fish was a little more flavorful and spicy. I added lemon juice liberally and salsa, which made up for the blandness somewhat. My friends said their food was good, though far from authentic. I give three stars to this place mostly because of its ambience. I wish the waitresses would give diners more time at the table though..i felt a tad rushed. But maybe that was because of the crowd. Yeah, I can sure go back here again.",

I had the taco and enchilada combo, it comes with refried beans and fideo. I got the spinach con queso inside my enchilada and it was really tasty but everything else was  average mexican food. I think the chips and salsa were the best part. They are great because you get both corn and flour tortilla chips with pico de gallo and hotter sauce. Our waitress didn't come by very often and the service was pretty slow. If I were to go here again I would definitely sit out on the patio and do chips/salsa with a frosty drink.",

I think this restaurant's proximity to the Arizona Grand hotel is the only reason it's still around. We were staying at the Arizona Grand, and decided to order take-out for our group of five people.  I ordered a chicken burrito with rice and beans as a side. What I received was a soggy burrito, with half chicken and half shredded beef (I don't eat red meat). That was unfortunate, but they didn't include the beans either- there was only rice as a side.  I thought the salsa was decent, but the chips were extremely greasy and not really worth eating.  Bottom-line: I'd pass on this place if I were you- there's lots of good Mexican restaurants around here more deserving of your business.",

    "text": "My wife, youngest child and myself were visiting my oldest boy in Phoenix on 4/19/15. Since my son goes to school near this restaurant we decided to try it out. That was our first big mistake....We were seated immediately and were given the usual chips and salsa which weren't fresh and more than likely came out of a bag. We ordered the Pollo Fundido ( second mistake ) the Taco salad ( third mistake ) a bowl of the corn and chorizo soup and a tamale plate for my youngest. The first flag went up when the food arrived unusually fast and upon taken my first bite found out why.... My plate, the Pollo Fundido was in various stages of temperature. The plate was scalding hot, the chicken was somewhat warm, the beans were the same, the Mexican spaghetti had obviously been sitting out on the counter for several hours as it had already hardened into a cold lump and last but not least the sauce for the chicken was stone cold !!! I'm not even sure how their kitchen could possibly accomplish all this on one plate but they did...As I waited for the waitress to return, my wife then proceeded to show me the entire avocado pit she had just pulled out of her salad. When the waitress was a no show to the table I flagged down the bus boy and asked him to get our waitress. Not sure if there was a language barrier ( I did ask him twice...) but he promptly just walked over to another table and started cleaning it, completely ignoring my request. The waitress finally showed up and after explaining the short comings of the meal asked to see the manager. This took approximately 10 minutes for the manager to come by the table at which time my family was finishing their respective meals. She told me that she would replace my meal immediately to which I replied \"NO\" because I did not trust the quality of the food nor their kitchen staff. Long story short, I never ate dinner that night as we had to get on the road back to Tucson, my oldest boy said his soup was \"ok\" but only ate 1/2, my youngest didn't finish his because he said it had \" no taste, my wife got most of the way through hers ( very difficult to screw up a salad...) And, well, you know my end of it. Even with the 2 meals taken off we still wound up paying $34 for a crappy meal !!!!!. Take our word for it, if you want a Mexican meal on a par with this place, go to Taco Bell, at least it will be hot......",

People in the rest of my party were also very displeased with their entrees to say the least. Ordered a cocktail, which the waitress just raved about, why I don't know. Was basically a kool-aide drink in a cocktail glass. But here lies my biggest problem. Started with the guacamole, chips and salsa. Not the best but eatable. Here comes my entree, OMG. I thought I was going to die! Literally! Two bites or so and I start feeling queasy. And I mean this crap won't stop. So I take a trip to the rest room and figure I will let it pass. But my stomach says different. I started throwing up there proceeded to come home and couldn't stop until every little thing I had eaten at that God forsaken place was out of my system. Will I try it again? I say not. When I told the waitress about the incident she was very nice and quite apologetic. The other women that was called over never introduced herself and was quite rude. Offered to take it off my bill and that was that. By the way I ordered plate # 2 with a green tamale al a cart. I still feel queasy just thinking about it. Good thing there were no great smells or aromas or I probably would not be able to eat this combo any where else either. And to think I went there with such great expectations. I wish that woman, whom ever she may be, would have been courteous. Then maybe I might think of giving them another, try not. Lol.",

She kept the drinks coming all night and was on top of all our requests.  When we arrived, they had chips and salsa already set throughout the tables. The salsa was decent, not spicy at all (I do have to say that as a Mexican, what I find \"not spicy\" my fiance will think is hot). One thing I will suggest that I had never realized was a \"thing\" was to request flour tortilla chips instead of the traditional corn that they bring you. A friend requested them and let me sample, and they were much better than the corn chips! (I must've been living under a rock) For my entree I ordered a beef chimichanga. The chimi was not fried at all, it was more like a burrito smothered in the sauce (which didn't have a good flavor) so I didn't eat very much of it. The rice and beans were not great either but after trying the chimi, I hadn't expected them to be. Overall, we had great service but the food wasn't very good.",

Aside from that, the food is usually great. Lots of lower calorie options available.  Today, is not one of the days I have rave reviews. We sat there waiting for 30 minutes after being told it would be a 10 minute wait. They said no tables available. Do they not understand that we can see the patio and half the dining area from the waiting area? We could see 8 open tables in the patio. 5 open tables in the 1st dining area. We passed13 open tables when we were finally called inside.   We waited another 15 minutes at our table before we were even acknowledged by our waitress. She took mine and my husband's drink orders, and ran off to go fill them. That would have been super awesome, except there were 5 of us at the table!!!  We ordered drinks for the rest of our party when she brought our drinks. She brought our food, and then hurried away again. I had to stop her at another table to remind her about drinks for the rest of my table. The drinks were for my children!!   This was honestly the worst restaurant experience I've had in a long time. This used to be one of my favorite places. Now I'm not sure if I would ever recommend this to my out of town guests again. For a restaurant that gets so much resort business, you'd think they'd treat their customers better.",

They have one of the biggest tequila selections in Arizona, by far! And if you're a Tequila connoisseur like myself you will appreciate it.  I'm a big fan of their Sunday brunch. They have a great selection at great prices and can really modify a the plates to your liking if you want. If it's a nice day out, I suggest sitting out on the patio. They have umbrellas to shade your area, but it's cute to see the ducks from the pond hanging out and walking around.",

It was a bit of surprise that they do not offer white meat chicken for the tacos, only mixed. That tells me that this place is saving money and I'm not buying the bartenders \"it keeps it moist excuse\" Menu prices are right out of Scottsdale, but the free chips and salsa were good. Chips were kinda warm and salsa was chunky variety with some onions floating in the bowl. Too small of a bar area for a good happy hour crowd, so this place won't need to be revisited.",

    "text": "My favorite \"Mexican\" in Phoenix.... If you are planning a lunch trip, be sure to get there early (before 11:30) or you will be in for a wait - but it is well worth it.  I LOVE their salsa & chips, the best anywhere IMO and they also offer a 'hot' version that you can mix in to taste.  I am a fan of 'hot' foods with a bit of pep to them and Aunt Chilada's delivers on specific dishes (ie there is plenty of other offerings if spicy is not your style). The 'Aunt Chilada Special' is my favorite - a cubed, spicy beef filled enchilada covered with both red and green sauces, topped off with cheese and sour cream, served with a choice of sides (I normally go with rice and 'fidao' (sp) - kinda \"Mexican spagetti\".  I have been eating here for many years as do many people I know, there IS a reason it is always packed - Highly recommended.  There is seating both inside and outside, so depending upon the weather and your personal taste you can do either.",

However, the manager was excellent. She came and asked how everything was. When I replied that it was just OK, she wanted details. The manager was very appreciative of my feedback and even took my fish tacos off of the check (something I did not expect). Also, they accidentally charged my card too much. The manager that I spoke to was very concerned and understanding. He even went to their accounting department to verify that their records only showed the correct charge. Although my first experience with the food was not great, I am considering giving them another shot thanks to the excellent managers.",

Never asked what drinks we wanted. And no they were not busy we were the only table in that area. Tried the salsa and it tasted weird so had my husband try it he started gagging and had to spit it out. It was starting to ferment because it was bad! I told the server there was something \"off\" about the salsa and it tasted sour. He rolled his eye and said \"okay\" That was enough for us we got up and walked out. If you serve old rotten salsa I don't even want to know what else you try to push the exp. date on!! Absolutely gross!",

We sat down and it took 10 minutes for a waitress to come by to ask about drink orders (we were fine with the water we were brought with chips). We finally ordered after looking over the menu and we didnt see the waitress for at least 15-20 minutes where she came back to our glasses empty for at least half of that time. It took 30 minutes after ordering our simple choices to get our food. People who had sat down 10 minutes prior got their food the same time as us. The food was amazing and worth the wait.

They did place a few umbrellas around which helped some. Had 3 options to choose from; Chimichanga, Enchiladas or a Creamy Chicken Fundito. I went with that. The Jalapeno Cream sauce was delicious but unfortunately my chicken was extremely dry. At the end of our meal we were served beautiful desserts. A chocolate cake & flan. Both were good. Chocolate Cake wonderfully rich &  The Flan was light & appropriately caramelized. Service was great for such a large party. We had about 3 servers assisting our table. Will come back again and explore more of the menu.",

They brought me a shredded taco instead of a ground beef taco so I sent it back. When the new taco arrived and I went to take a bite the shell was stale.

I did not care for the chips they brought out.  I ended up ordering two shredded beef tacos, rice and black beans.  The tacos were really good the meat had a good flavour.  The beans were good and the rice was good too.      There are so many varieties of Mexican food here it is crazy.  I liked this food at Aunt Chilada's, but it might not appeal to others.   Disclaimer I tend to like all styles of Mexican food.  My family made a lot of Spanish dishes and it is really different than Mexican dishes.  You can only eat so much chicken, shrimp, paella varieties and tortilla de patatas.  I loved eating at my friends house for dinner as a kid because the Mexican food was yummy.",

Went on a Sunday afternoon, I guess it was slow service so they were seating everyone in this small room and the tables were so close together it was very uncomfortable and loud. Our server was nice but the service was not anything special. The pricing is expensive but they give u large portions. For example  The nachos on the appetizer menu is $16.95 but it feeds 4 people. Pina Colada was $9 and not very good. It was all ice and I did not taste one ounce of alcohol. I did not like the chips as salsa...the salsa was a little bland. The patio looks interesting and I could see it being a nice atmosphere in the evening.",

Most of the employees are exceptional with their customer service but a few have decided to have some disgusting attitude when we asked where our orders were and if they would be out soon. Otherwise, the food is okay and thankfully we had a nice table. My sisters Margarita was \"watered\" down, or that's what the waiter said when my sister asked for something different. That wasn't mentioned when she requested the drink. My in-law asked for a second Pepsi and hadn't gotten one for about 25 minutes. Most of the reviews for this restaurant have been good but my experience was unacceptable. We had been there for about 50 minutes and only 4 meals were asked for. This service was good outrageous and I will never come here again. And even when we did get our food, all of the orders were messed up. Thankfully they were fixed quickly. But, the wait wasn't worth it for our food. Only one of the dishes was remotely good but pretty plain and the rice has no flavor.",

Salsas were fair but nothing special. Sadly the relleno was flavorless and the black beans also. Other order was a SW chicken caesar. The waitress asked if having it tossed was okay but when it came it had only had dressing in a big glop in the bottom of the bowl. For $10 it was pretty small and a salad only costs about $1.00 at most w/o chicken... which was well grilled and tasty but the cheese added was pretty bland as well. Sorry but will choose another Mexican restaurant in the future.",

One of my friends noticed that the chips were stale so she proceeded to ask for fresh beans. I ordered 2-enchilada dinner with black beans. The tortillas from the enchiladas were tough, I couldn't cut them using only a fork. Enchilada's are supposed to be tender, it really seemed as the tortillas were left out and used the next day. The Black beans were so bland and came out of a can. I ordered a side of guacamole and had to ask the nice server to take it back. It tasted really bad-not fresh at all. I have given two stars for the service. It's not the waiters fault so I can appreciate them.",

I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant and loved how the dining rooms were in separate little buildings and how the courtyard was beautifully lit, it added an air of intimacy to the restaurant.   We didn't have an appetizers, we noshed on the awesome portion of chips and salsa we were served, very yummy! For my meal I ordered the veggie enchiladas and a raspberry margarita (they were out of pomegranate for shame!). The enchiladas were not great at all and totally fell apart as I was eating them. Definitely worth the loss of a star or two. The margarita on the other hand was supremely delicious and it was not long before I'd drank it up.   If I'm ever in Tempe again I don't think Aunt Chilada's would be my first pick but overall it's an okay joint.",

To end the amazing meal we had fried ice cream that was a trip to heaven! I wish it was not so far away from my house so I could come back again.

    "text": "My wife and I went here for dinner, after having a great dinner at another Aunt Chilada's a few years ago. The hostess told us it would be 15-20 minutes, but we could be seated inside now. I said sure, and the hostess had the waitress take us to a table in the back in a dark corner, and at the time there were only a few table seated at the time. I asked her \" if we could sit at a small table up front\", which the waitress took the table. She comes back with the menus, and says, \"hi, I am back\". We give her our drink order, and our food order. She gave the kitchen the wrong number for my combo dinner, so I had to send it back. The waitress returns with the  correct combo for me, and says\" you got direct from the oven, so at least it is hot\". We finished our food, and working on our drinks after the waitress had taken our empty plates. She had come through the room 2 more times, and never looked in our direction, or came over to ask us if we were ready for our check. I had to call her as she was leaving the next table over for our check. We got our check, and she had billed us for the extra dinner that she had written down wrong, and given the kitchen. At that time asked for the Manager due to the poor service, and expressed our displeasure with the service. The manager informed us that this location was owned by the resort, and not affiliated with the other Aunt Chilada's. The manager asked us if we got good service from a name, which turned out to be the waitresses name, whom she had never introduced her self. I had to ask the manager who that was. When I told the manager that we didn't get good service, she left our table, telling us that she will take care of our check.",

It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights.

    "text": "It's funny to me that the reviews are all over the place for Aunt Chilada's.  Maybe I'm just lucky, but I always have  a good experience.    I love the chips and salsa.  I usually order their hot sauce and I mix it for better flavor.  By itself, I think it tastes good, but it's very mild.  Maybe another reason I might be lucky is that I always order the same thing. I get the beef flauta platter with beans and fideo. (Fideo is like a mexican spaghetti)   Service is always great for me, and fast.  It's almost like one of those cartoons, where they take the order, go through the door, and come right back out with your order.  I went last night and had the same experience as usual.  My server Whitney was very friendly and super fast. I had a margarita this time and it was really good.  I sat on the patio, the weather was beautiful.  They have new chairs on the patio!  The old ones sat so low, the table was up to your chest. Awkward. Great improvement.  My understanding is that it is part of the Arizona Grande resort and is probably why the pricing is kind of high for entrees.  They're so far away from the actually hotel though, it looks like it stands alone. Also, you would think they would be open until 10p weeknights, but they're not, only 9p.  I recommend you at least try it once. If you ask for Whitney, you'll get great service, so then you'll have to base your review on the food and the ambience. ;-)",

It arrived super soggy and not appetizing at all. The beans and rice were ok.   The kids meals were just that. Kids meals.   The winner of the night surprisingly was my sons plain nachos. Yep, they managed to get chips with melted cheese right.  The sopapillas were not good at all.   Probably best to skip this joint really.",

    "text": "I first went to this restaurant over 20 years ago, might have been soon after it opened.  We had wonderful food that first time.  I still remember having the carnitas (pork) burro.  We went a second time a month or so later and the deterioration had already set in.  I ordered the same burro and it was very dry.  About a year later I took relatives there and again tried the carnitas burro and it was again dry and uninspired.  No one else raved about their food but things overall were still average.   Now to the recent experience... Over the past 3 months group of people and myself wanted to meet and talk at a restaurant so THEY choose ACs on two occasions.  I was hoping for a good experience but it was even worse than my last one  years ago.  On both occasions the service was quite slow.  On the second visit the server literally said, you should order now cuz you probably won't see me again soon and see was in a hurry to get the orders and get out.  I suspect the owners purposely understaff.  I would have again ordered carnitas but they no longer offer it except with a very high priced combo meal. So I ordered my other go to choice, a Green Burro, for both these visits.  Both times it was no better than average and overpriced.    The chips and salsa are also just average.  As another reviewer mentioned, the salsa tastes like they cut it with canned tomato sauce, it's soupy and has no bit whatsoever.   I don't know how this place stays in business.",

We saw him (Ryan) every 10-15 minutes. Never refilled our drinks. We even had to discard all our used plates in a near by tray. We were there for 30 minutes before we were able to even order. After food arrived most things were burnt! We ordered the Nachos and Fajitas. Had 5 pieces of chicken in the Fajita and was told if we wanted cheese the up charge would be $3. In the end of it all this was the first and last time we will be visiting. Paid way too much for bad food. Would've spoken with the manager but we are sure he even would have took to long to come around.",

Family was too hungry to be picky and could not take the 2 seconds to look it up on Yelp.  So we went off the grid.  The service was friendly and attentive.  At one point, they made a mistake and brought our table a second beer.  Which they gave to us, for making the mistake.  Don't get me wrong, I was going to give them a good review anyway, the free beer was just icing on the cake.  The food was very fresh.  Right down to the chips and salsa.  I certainly think that it could  have used more heat, but I feel the same way about water.  I was craving some Chile Verde, so went with the pork.  Not what I had expected.  I was thinking pork marinaded in green sauce.  It was grilled pork fillets that were seasoned to perfection.  It was outstanding.  The Fajita plate had a little more heat, not nearly enough for me, but plenty for my wife.    Kids had quasadilla and were treated like kings.  I highly recommend this place.  Great atmosphere, great food and most importantly a moat around the front.",

The chicken enchilada were made of some shredded chicken mixed an odd tomato sauce/seasoning. It was NOT good and the portions were too small for  the price. The fideo that came with the enchiladas was a disaster.    I will say that the kids menu portions were huge.  A really large taco and a really big bean burro were the best deal there.  The kids price was definitely cheap considering the size.  We didn't have any alcohol so I can't comment on that but either way stay away from  this place it's not worth your money.  We ordered a fajita plate, two enchilada plates, two kids meals, and 5 sodas and our check was almost $ 90. Considering food was NOT good this was a waste of money. Our server was very nice though.",

Their salsa isn't  half bad even though its made from canned tomatoes with added fresh cilantro, the chips are great, always hot and fresh.  Their Carnitas are some of my favorite, my husband is  fan of the cheese enchiladas and I also order the fish tacos too(see pic). All these items have been consistently good.  It can get busy with the annoying resort crowd, but if your looking for just plain old generic Mexican food that will fill you up and not rip you off, this is it. Yes I've had better and yes there is better, but like I said before:  It is what it is and I like it for that.

We were visiting with a friend and we greeted with Salsa and Chips which was both fresh and flavorful.  We then ordered the Pollo Fundido which is generally one of our favorite dishes.  Given that they used Chicken Tenders it was rather dry and so trying to flavor it becomes tough. The white sauce was good and over all the food was average.  While the food was average the service was excellent.  Beverly was fantastic and wish there was a Beverly at every restaurant that we went to.  She made our every experience a fantastic one.  Even though the food was A-OK, the service made it a very very pleasant experience.  Thanks Beverly for your undivided attention when we were there.",

The chairs at the outside tables were way too short, and at 5' 10\" that doesn't happen very often.  The employees were attentive and nice. The chips were stale and the salsa was bland.  The $8 guacamole dip was also bland. My dinner was typical Mexican food: chicken taco and enchilada combo... Bland chicken and greasy taco shell. My husbands fajita's arrived on a cold platter with cilantro piled on top, even though he ordered it without because he is allergic! The waitress did notice the cilantro and offered to replace it, but my husband opted to remove it himself. His response to his meal was like mine, unimpressive and bland.  The margarita he got from the \"machine\" was not good, he didn't even finish it.  We aren't positive if this is related or not, but my husband became mildly ill a few hour after dinner and had stomach issues for the next 15 hours or so. No vomiting, but very close. Not a fun way to spend the last night of our weekend getaway.  We wouldn't go back and we wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",

The food is typical American-Mexican with lots of cheese (not a bad thing) but, a bit overpriced in my opinion- I think that stems from being so close to a hotel.

I felt Taco Bell has more authenticity than this place. I hate to say that but it was a complete waste of money.",

    "text": "We were in Arizona for a short vacation and my one requirement was some good Mexican food (and some sun ). Lol  While laying by the pool we started asking other guests for recommendations. Aunt Chiladas was mentioned.  They mentioned the outdoor patio and the margaritas. I immediately went to Yelp to look at the rating and reviews. Hmmm... 2 1/2 stars,  not something I will generally give a try but it was close and we were hungry.   Upon arrival,  the water feature out front was lovely. We asked for patio seating and it was also lovely. It was a little cool out but no worries because they have plenty of heaters to take the chill away until the margaritas kick in. Lol.  The service is very good. They brought us menus and water and chips and salsa right away and our server took our drink orders giving us time to look the menu over. The El Diablo is the Margarita to order. They have a tequila menu with lots of different tasty brands also. We started with the table side guacamole. Very fresh and worth the extra money to have it made to order.  I always order street tacos any chance I get. There was a choice of meats and I went with the Carne asada, Caritas and chicken tinga. It came with Pico, avocado crema and pickled onions. You can also choose between flour or corn tortillas. They were spectacular. My husband had the Pollo fundido and he said it was very good. They give you a lot of food and I think it was a good value.  We tried 2 other restaurants Macayo's Mexican Depot Cantina and Los Reyes de la Torta  and didn't care for them as much.  In fact we ended up coming back to Aunt Chiladas again our last night in Arizona. I again ordered the street tacos (why try to improve on perfection). My husband ordered a burro and enjoyed it.  I'm not sure why this restaurant only has 2 1/2 stars. It is a nice comfortable restaurant with good service,  great drink selections and awesome food priced appropriately. Give them a chance,  you won't regret it.",

    "text": "It's been awhile since I've eaten here for lunch, let alone eating here for dinner.  Therefore, since we were in the Tempe area attending a symposium, and had to stop by Fry's Electronics; we decided to give this place a try since it was just across Baseline Road, and it was already past 9PM.  The entrance, the bridge over the mini pond, the patio, and the overall exterior appearance was just very inviting. We were encouraged that this may turn out to be a good spontaneous choice for this evening late dinner.  When we entered, the hostess greeted us and notified us that there would be a 15-20 minute wait. Although there were plenty of available tables as it was later in the evening, and the place wasn't really that busy; we chalked it up to just standard operating procedure in preparation prior to guests being seated.  It didn't really take that long for them to buzz us, and guide us to our seats. The hostess provided us with two menus, and then the adventure began.  When we started perusing the two page menu, it appears that whomever used these last had poured remnants of salsa and minute pieces of chips onto this menu, as it was all over the backside of both mine and my wife's. We had to quickly grab and use the napkins we had to clean ourselves up from the annoying mess. We flagged down our server, Marcia, and she graciously apologized, and quickly gathered up cleaner menus.  Upon returning, she informed us that she would get us chips and salsa (we could've eaten the ones that were on the menus, but that would be gross and there wasn't enough of it anyway =) ).  However, she got busy, and in passing, she informed us that one of the other servers would do so. That did not happen, and when she realized that we still hadn't gotten what she promised us, she went ahead and took care of it and took our order.  Now, here's the quandary with this place at night. I am a firm believer in romantic candle lit dinner places, as long as there is enough ambient light from \"somewhere\" (including a well lit candle) so as to be able to read the menu. Such was not the case here. It was dimly lit in certain areas that I had to use my cell phone's flashlight app to provide enough lighting so that we could read our menus and know what to order.   Now, if you think that this was an anomaly, and we were just being particular about this. The 3 separate groups of new arrivals on the other side of the room did the same exact thing as we did. The gentlemen who sat alone across from us had to walk across the room to get enough lighting to read his bill. And Marcia, our server, had pull out her phone to light up ours and other guests' bills to verify the total. Not sure what is going on here, but a little bit more spot lighting in certain places would go a long way to solving this minor annoyance. In any case, this is the reason why I have no pictures as I ran down my phone's battery to light up the menu.  I had the shredded beef burro (enchilada style), and a shredded beef taco. My wife had the Chimichanga.   The flavor wasn't bad, but we've had better. However, after a long day of sparse sustenance, we were famished enough that we were able to consume our meails.  I had the flan for dessert. It was too sweet for my taste, and it didn't have enough caramel on top. It tasted like it was pre-packaged.  All in all, it was a mediocre experience that didn't start out well, but ended on a slightly higher note which is why this review is 3 stars, and not 2 - especially with the miscue on the salsa filled menus. Someone should really be checking these before handing them out to guests. I thought that is what the hostesses were supposed to do. Perhaps, I am mistaken.  Marcia, our server, was just very efficient and she managed to recover what could've been a disastrous experience for us.  In any case, it was a beautiful night, and had beautiful company; so I never did mind too much the missteps of this place.",

Without even looking at her book, she said \"I don't have any reservations under that name\" in a VERY rude tone. Then, on our way out we stopped to ask her about the tamales and if they sell them to go. Without even looking up at us, she said \"there is a sign right there\" and pointed to the wall behind her.  This is horrible customer service! She acted like it put her out to have to answer our question. As the hostess, she is the face of the restaurant since she is the first person we see. This is NOT the first thing you want your customers to deal with. Management needs to have a talk to her or give her some more training. Otherwise, she should be in the back of the house where she doesn't have to talk to customers. Food was really good though, we would have given 4-5 stars if it wasn't for the hostess.",

The service was friendly and quick enough, but the selections were completely overpriced. I ended up requesting just an appetizer just to keep within my lunch budget.  The lemonade was bad. As in made with turned lemons and not sweet at all. And if they didn't make it, they need to clean the fountain machine or something.  I got a shredded beef quesadilla and it was so greasy I had to tip my plate to keep the remainder from swimming while I tried to eat. It tasted good once I squeezed out the drippings from each piece. I wasn't impressed.  But what annoyed me the most was although they automatically added a 20% tip onto every ticket, when the server brought back my change from a $20, she kept the extra 83 cents. Rounding up quite a bit there, eh? $2.73 tip for a crappy $9.50 appetizer is asking too much.  Next time someone suggests this place, I'll pass.",

Perfect place to grab a drink and an appetizer and sit at the patio- chips and salsa were good. Then have your main curse somewhere else. We went there for lack of restaurants at a walking distance from the Arizona Grand Resort. The patio and ambiance were nice and the weather was perfect to sit outside. Service was good. We ordered a small guacamole. The avocados were ripe, but the guacamole had no flavor and it had awkwardly a bit of shredded cheese on top. We kept adding salsa, limes and salt to add flavor to the guacamole. My friend ordered fish tacos. Parts of the fish were burnt. My other friend and I ordered a combo of enchilada with a chile relleno. Half of the plate was covered with melted yellow and white cheese. After finding the chile relleno and enchilada under the melted cheese they were ok. Asked for tortillas and charged us extra each without letting us know for chewy tortillas. The amounts of food are large, that's for sure. The side of Fideo was not very good. I don't mind paying 30-40 dollars for good food, but this felt as money not well spent.",

    "text": "My dad ordered a chile relleno.... and it came out with what looked like chicken inside?? what the??? I flagged down our sweet server Norma who said although she would never dare make her own chile relleno that way, Aunt chilada's does.  It seriously looked like canned chicken and I was shocked they would ruin a simple dish like that by adding chicken stuffed inside.  My dish was just simple taquitos and the chicken was so dry it was near jerky.  Salsa was average... nothing about this place was \"mexican\" and the ducks all over the place kinda grossed me out.  NEVER again will I spend my $ or allow anyone to spend theirs while in company.  Aunt Chilada's... you FAIL!",

    "text": "Oh Dear Aunt Chilada, where did you go?  When I was young we would go out to eat on very special occasions.  I remember the excitement of going to Aunt Chilada's for birthday dinners and having a great time.    I'm not sure if it's the childhood memories not holding up, or the change in management, but Aunt Chilada's truly disappointed me.  We went with a part of four, and I was the only person who had been there before.  The interior and decor was EXACTLY as I remembered it, meaning that in 15 years, I don't think they've even touched up the paint.  Once seated, we found that the room was very noisy, with only 3 parties in the room.  It was also extremely crowded, with tables much closer than they needed to be.  The service was adequate, other than sitting dry waiting for more drinks.  They did bring chips and salsa quickly, and the staff was polite.  Now, to the part that was so heartbreaking for me.  The food.  Meh about sums up what I thought.  I tried a little off of everyone's plate, and across the board it was so-so.  Nothing inspired me, nothing stood out.  While it's still better than Taco Bell, it really seemed like they were phoning it in.  There was no symphony of flavors, nothing unexpected.   All in all, this is a good place to take your East Coast relatives who can't handle spice, for a stereotypical Mexican meal.  It's kind of like the Disney version of Mexico.  For natives like myself, especially those who either cook their own food, or love a little spice and excitement, don't waste your time.",

    "text": "It was my husband's birthday and we were a group of 12 friends. I called in at 5:30pm to book a table for dinner since we were a big group and I wanted to make sure there was no wait time but the lady who picked the call told me that they weren't taking any reservations and that I could just walk in. We arrived there at 7:00pm and when asked for a table, the hostess asked us to wait for 40 - 50min. We kept waiting and their staff didn't even bother to let us know that it was taking so much time. Their only answer was that there were open tables but were short staffed. I understand but wouldn't it be courteous to at least let us know when such a big group is waiting to be seated.    We were ready to order 5min after we got the table because everybody were hungry by then, our server didn't bother to come get the order or to even check on us. We had to let 2 different waiters know that we were ready to order. After the long wait, one would hope that at least the food would be good but unfortunately that wasn't True too. The fajitas were cold and looked like the veggies on it weren't fresh either.   I ordered Enchiladas de Harina and hold the server in specific that I wanted vegetarian option since I am a strict vegetarian and guess what, he brought in Chicken enchiladas at the 11th hour when the restaurant was closing. I was so furious and let him know that I wasn't happy at all with the food and the service and all I got back as an answer was \"can I take this plate away\" really???? don't you even care what the customer is saying?   Deeply regret making this restaurant choice, I had 11 other friends who went home still hungry. You just ruined my husband's birthday dinner.",

I ordered the 2 shredded chicken enchiladas with black beans and rice & it was delicious! The portions were really big! My coworker also ordered 2 enchiladas, one cheese one shredded chicken & she also said they were really good. Her sides she chose were rice & fidello. I was surprised to notice that they offered fidello, she said it was really good.  I was most excited that I only paid about $16.00 with a drink & $4.00 for a tip, so total of $20 for really good food, great service & VERY LARGE portions. I would recommend this place to others. They have a nice patio area where you can sit outside & there is a man made pond, which was very nice. They also offer happy hour daily so thats a plus!",

I'm yet to try the food personally but my girlfriend did and she love the chicken tacos. The staff is really nice and friendly and it has atmosphere to it very authentic. I would advise getting there on the earlier end of happy hour as the location is right on baseline and next to the i10 so lots of traffic getting in and out so save yourself the headache by arriving late. Side note happy hour ends at 6pm!",

The small dining area next to the hostess was empty and I asked if we could sit there.  Hostess said no but would seat us in the main dining room.  That place was packed.  It was not only packed it was extremely noisy.  There were three groups and individual tables were placed between them.  Oh my!  What an awful environment.  We waited for a while and no server arrived.  So, we checked out the lunch menu.   Nothing about this menu was inexpensive.  It was pretty pricey for lunch.  The single taco plate was $10.99.  We sat there debating whether to stay or leave.  Our server hadn't arrived yet and too many negatives were already coming up about this place --- loud, expensive and slow service is what we were seeing.  No thanks.  We went down the road and had a great lunch.",

The numerous times I went I was helped right away, seated right away and the food came very quickly and tasted wonderful.  They give you large container of chips and couple different salsas one hot one regular which is very chunky.  I ordered a chicken burrito which was very tasty, large chunks of delicious chicken the only thing that tasted a bit off for me was the burrito sauce at first tasted burnt but it was not I believe it was the chili in the sauce that I did become more accustomed to.  I then ordered the next day a chicken enchilada again very tasty and flavorful chicken, the rice was delicious as well as the beans.  I was not looking to spending over $20 a meal for myself but that is what it averaged with a tip, maybe I am more frugal than this place would allow.  The third day I ordered the smaller portion of just one enchilada with beans and rice this seems to be more appropriate for me and it was just over $10.  Overall I would return again if in the area.",

Service was ok, we did mention it was our first time in and asked what they recommend and he looked like we were asking for the moon. He suggested a burrito but didn't really sell it. So we got some cold dos xx and tried two dishes. I really liked their salsa, it absolutely tasted fresh and was on point. The green chili burrito was really good and the steak dish was very very salty. The guacamole was already browning which brought this review down. Don't serve it when you can see it is a day old!  Overall we would go back for the burrito but not out of our way. The prices were very steep for lunch. Two meals and two small drafts were over $50. That seemed ridiculous for lunch. There didn't seem to be any specials or any lunch items and $13+ for a burrito and it was good but not that good. Would have been nice if the salsa had a slight kick, it did not but it was fresh unlike the guacamole.",

    "text": "So, we stopped here because the munchkin went out of town and we thought happy hour to start off the weekend would be fun. It definitely was. $4 margaritas- Yes, please!!! Our waitress Katie B. was marvelous. Super nice and I loved how when we got our food she commented, \"Oh, I'm so happy for you both.\" Like she already knew it was going to be the best food. Haha. Something invigorating about a person who just enjoys their job. I got the carne asada quesadilla, which went great with my margarita and my few sips of water, haha. Husband won the choice of the night though with his shredded beef chimilingas which he ordered a side of jalapeno cream cheese sauce. Juicy. Tasty. And if I hadn't had a family event to get to later on that night (hence the happy hour), I probably would've ordered another serving. One thing to keep in mind though, can be a bit pricey but from the plates I saw coming out to other guests, very generous portions. Overall, good way to start our long weekend. Wouldn't mind coming back again soon.",

I'd read other reviews to beware that the salsa here was spicier than at most places -- I've got to say that was definitely NOT my experience. I don't know if they've gotten complaints and default to a mild version for the tourists, but ours was little more than tomato sauce with a few onions in it.  On the plus side, the kids absolutely LOVED their cheese crisps.",

The first is a very chunky mild tomato salsa and the other is smoother by spicier.   We all enjoyed to charro beans but mixed opinions on the fide.  The burros and chimis were well portioned meat to tortilla ratio.  My only complaint is how the street tacos were served- covered in cabbage to the extent that I could not identify which taco was which.  Very difficult to eat and enjoy.

I guess we pay a premium for that. The service we had was good, and I can tell the wait staff works hard to serve. I seem to remember that 10-15 years ago the food was much better.

Our server Connor, who I might add was speedy, charming, and friendly, recommended us margaritas and in the blink of an eye they were bestowed upon us like mana from the heavens. During our meal, Connor also brought us different salsas to try out. After our tongues were seared with the intangible and unrelenting pain of ghost peppers, Connor brought us milk without even being asked to. Throughout our meal he was extremely attentive and even gave an excellent demonstration of how to prepare authentic guacamole. Thank you for the great service, we will definitely  be going again soon and sitting in Connor's section.",

    "text": "There were some pro's about this place: Service was decent and some of the food was really good. However, other food was just meh. The items that were good: Salsa had lots of onions in it which made me happy (I am a big onion lover!) and had a really good fresh flavor, the chips were nice and crisp, the jalapeno cream sauce that came with my numero ocho (8) combo was delicious with just the right amount of spice, and the fideo that the hubby ordered was different but I really enjoyed it (hubby said it was too plain for him). Now onto the other food: Hubby said his pork chimichanga wasn't bad and that the pork was cooked well but needed more seasoning, my chili relleno was ok but the batter had a weird texture to it, and my spinach enchilada was not very good at all. I like to have other components inside the enchilada rather then just plain spinach and unfortunately, these just had lumps of unflavored spinach with nothing else. So all in all, I would say this place was ok. There were some items that are good enough for me to come back but I would just try something else on the next visit.",

    "text": "I grew up around here... before there was the Pointe at South Mountain and any of the office suites that line baseline road there was orange groves and nestled within were cool old houses along with a Mexican restaurant called Juan Tanamera's.  In fact my dad's friend built his house there and I have pictures from the 70's of my dad helping to build this house.  My dad would bring my sister and I here for dinner often... the food was great and we always had a great time.  Once the Pointe was built they bought the Mexican restaurant and named it Aunt Chilada's.  Everything changed... the menu was different, the staff was different.  The only thing that remained the same was the structure of the building and the cool ponds that surrounded it which no longer have coy but sometimes an occasional duck.  I agree with the other reviewers of this place that the service is lack luster and the food is OK.  There is one thing I like here and that is the albondigas soup... small bite sized meatballs with veggies and a savory broth; they also put fideo noodles in it which makes it even better.  I do crave this soup and since it is very close to my work i often call in an order of it.  Every time I walk in to pick it up it always brings up fond memories from the past.",

While this is not totally authentic Mexican it's good old AZ-style Sonoran-American combo plate comfort food. And it's really not that easy to find on the east coast. I grew up on this stuff so the nostalgia factor is huge. Such a pleasure having a chile relleno with frijoles refritos, rice and giant frozen margarita. Ahhhh, watch out for that brain freeze. The chips and salsa could have been a little better, but I ate too many of them as is.",

My disappointment came from the \"chicken\" not actually being chicken. Instead they were \"chicken bi-products\" chicken strips that weren't  even seasoned or grilled. You know the frozen \"grilled\" ones? They were microwaved and covered in the fundido sauce. The Fideo was seasone by obviously very old.   My pinacolada was nothing to brag about. Mediocre at best. Though the menu did specify chicken strips, I expected \"real\" quality chicken seasoned and grilled. Especially consider the price of the entree. I can only imagine what the beef is like. Perhaps it comes in a can? Becky the waitress was empathetic and offered to remove the entree from my bill. Customer service was good. Good was bad. Music...... was entertaining.",

I had the buffet which included several chimichanga's rice, beans, and salad. Everything tasted great. They brought out typical nachos and salsa which did not push the envelope by any means. The mild salsa was pretty much diced tomatoes. The hot was not very hot at all. The staff was friendly and attentive. We were in and out pretty fast despite a lunch rush. Its a good find.",

    "text": "Let me just say that if I could give this place a 0 star I would..  Aunt Chilada's, I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a very very long time & when I decided to take my family here for a birthday gathering it all went way down south & I can thank the staff here for it. Tonight I had my family 11 people including 4 children come here for dinner 9-13-14 around 5 o'clock..  My family had decorated the table with birthday items and we were in a secluded corner it looked like they had set up for large parties, from what I believe we were the only people in this side of the section of the restaurant. After about 10 mins of the kids laughing and the adults talking and the birthday squeakers going this place was ready to kick us out..  After we had ordered our server told us to stop being loud & for us to stop using the birthday favors. We said okay and had taken them from the kids.. Then adults were still talking amongst each other and a \"non-friendly\" \"extremely rude\" charge/supervisor/manager named Lindsay comes over with some other people and asked to talk to my mom who made the arrangements in the corner, I for one felt very offended by this. She is extremely rude to my mom and basically tells us if we don't shut up and stop bothering other people that we were going to be kicked out..  Mom: Are you asking us that we should leave?\" Lindsay: Yes, yes I'm wanting you to get out of our establishment.\"   I'm not quite sure if those are her exact words but yes she said \"GET OUT\" Who in the customer service business says \" GET OUT\" to a customer. YOU DON'T SAY THAT... HORRIBLE.  Who in the hell do you think you are to talk to my mother like that you pathetic piece of a \"customer service\" supervisor?!  She leaves with her little \"helpers\" and we sit down, my mom is beyond stressed out by this utmost disrespect. We are gathering our things to leave..  THEN we get it a third time right after Lindsey leaves!!  This idiot guy with some \"professional\" business clothes comes over to our table with security from the damn resort next door!  He starts telling us that we are being loud and blah blah blah.. I tell him \" Sir, you and your charges/supervisors have come over multiple times to tell us the same thing, we have stopped being loud & using the party favors quite a while ago & you keep coming over and interrogating us constantly we get it we have stopped\"   Manager: \"Okay, okay.. um thanks..   Now you have really pissed me off, I now feel offended because you are attacking me in front of my children. One of my children has a \"developmental delay\" he does not understand why you are being this way to us..   My husband stands up and says \"why don't we just leave, they are probably going to just spit in our food anyways\" yeah why dont we just go..  We stand up and start packing our things, what a horrible birthday dinner this has turned out to be. I have had bad service but to be attacking your customers because they are being \"loud\" is no excuse, they could have asked us kindly to be quiet but no, they would rather lose out on 200+ dollars of our money.   The only thing good that came out of this is that they excused our couple fountain drinks and iced teas that we did order.   Oh, and another thing the salsa tastes like crap, it was cold and tasted like something I would buy off the counter in the store for example: pace..  What a bad restaurant, don't go here, there are plenty of other good Mexican food restaurants around that are more enjoyable than this place..",

My wife, daughter, and I spent a lovely evening enjoying decent Mexican food and each other's company. Our waitress was great ! Never did we have to ask for refills on anything...chips or drinks.   Contrary to recent Yelps, our food arrived SUPER fast...on a Friday night...when the waitress had to traverse multiple dining rooms to serve us.  Now, being at a resort, the food WAS a bit pricey...though, the price was easier to bear after 32 ounces of a margarita they call \"El Diablo\"...which is a top shelf margarita with Grand Marnier (as per my tip).  Either way, not a bad restaurant...plus, it's within walking distance of the resort, which comes in handy after about half of that El Diablo.",

Chips were good, and chunky salsa had an enjoyable flavor. I ordered steak fajitas, and found that they were tender, but had a very off taste, similar to a dirty grill possibly. Off taste was more noticeable as meal went on resulting in eating less than one third of the entree before deciding I was better off avoiding it. Bill was dropped on table shortly after, no discussion of food quality, offer of drink refills, or other standard practices. This location is not related to another restaurant bearing the same name in Phoenix. Slow service and off tasting food resulted in the low rating.",

It did have a definite resort feel to it, and there is a resort next door. This is probably the reason some of the prices are up where they are.  Okay, the bathrooms were small for this size of a restaurant. Tiny, in fact. The men's room had a tight stall and a small urinal. The ladies' room was of a similar size, I'm told.  Tables - no booths.  So far, some of the better Mexican food we've found in Phoenix.  No lunch menu or specials offered, or we'd give it another star.",

    "text": "Our group of four was in Tempe for a conference, and as we were driving down Baseline I saw the name \"Aunt Chilada's\" and started laughing. So, obviously, we had to check it out the next night for dinner. Two members of the group are avid yelpers so we checked the ratings before going and almost skipped it -- SO glad that we didn't skip it. Recent reviews are more positive so perhaps ownership or management has changed, because this place was pretty nice.   We came for happy hour and were seated at a table. We cleared up that in order to get \"happy hour\" food you have to sit at the bar--not sure why this is the policy. It seems like every other place I've gone for happy hour isn't concerned where you sit to sample the fare, but this place had some sort of policy according to the server. Luckily, they will let you order the happy hour margaritas at a table. (I really think they need to re-evaluate this policy, as they missed out on us ordering appetizers off the happy hour menu--once we learned we couldn't get happy hour food at the table, we all skipped the appetizers altogether and they lost out on some money there, since we were starving.)   Chips and salsa at the table was good. I thought the salsa was okay, perhaps average, but others at the table seemed to really like it. I did order some guacamole to go with the chips and the guac was pretty good. Glad that I ordered it.   For dinner the table tried different places. One plate was a combination plate that had tacos. She said that the beans were \"ok\" but really enjoyed the rest. Another member of the group tried out a different plate and liked it. Overall, everyone else seemed to like their plates.   I got a street tacos plate and tried out three different kinds of meat: chicken tinga, mahi mahi, and pork. First and foremost, the presentation of the tacos was very nice. I liked the cabbage and other toppings on the tacos. I did, however, feel like the mahi mahi didn't have its own flavor. The fish itself was somewhat bland. The pork taco had pork that was decent, although the seasoning was not my favorite. I really liked the chicken though and thought if I were to order this again, I'd just get all chicken tinga tacos. It came with a side of charro beans that were a little more watery than I'm used to (could be that the charro beans in Tucson are different). But overall it was a decent meal, decent price, big portions, and we all left happy.   Not the greatest Mexican food I've ever had, no, but in Tucson there are a lot of great Mexican food restaurants, food trucks, etc. I will say, however, that this place was better than Taco Bell (a lot of prior negative reviews said Taco Bell is better...no, not True, this place is better). I thought for the price, quality, and portion--this was a 4 star place.",

We were first given frozen canned salsa and crushed up tortilla chips. Next the \"fideo\" was literally spaghetti with carrots. The molcajete was smaller than expected, no cheese or cactus, the chicken was dry, and the tortillas were cold. Our waitress was nice but didn't have much people skills.  The only good part about this restaurant was the deep fried ice cream, which was delicious and was a good portion. And the sangria and the beer.",

I have been to the original location as well as the Tempe one and the Tempe location takes the cake for me as far as the outdoor patio. Something about the bistro lighting overhead makes for such a great setting and compliments the meal perfectly.   Every meal I have gotten I have enjoyed from this place as well! I normally get a combo item which includes tacos, enchiladas, flautas, etc. which fills me up. The meal also comes with refried beans and rice as well. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is the price. Being that I am in college I find the pricing to be a tad high for the meals and drinks they provide, and judging by other reviews I am not the only one that feels this way. I am all for paying the price if I feel that the quality and quantity reflects it.   The service has always been amazing at this location as well which I certainly appreciate! I will definitely be back to this place and feel it is a great place to spend special occasions at!",

As we were waiting to get a table people a few ahead of us were told that they were closing. We looked at our watches and it was about 10 until 9 and they said they closed at 9. You might want to close when you say and not earlier because it almost caused a riot.   We decided to sit at the bar instead of waiting for the bottom to fall out of the mess at the front. Sat down and the bartender was pretty quick and really personable. He was the best part about this whole place.   First let me say that this place is terrible. I went to their website and it was voted 'Best of' for several things that were totally NOT best of anything. Worst of, yes. Best of, stop using that phrase with this restaurant. Does not go.  First up was chips and salsa. The salsa really was actually right on. It was fresh and had a nice kick to it, but the chips? They must of run out of their 'best of' chips because these tasted like stale Tostitos. Oh man, stale Tostitos would have been an improvement, actually.   We then ordered the spicy queso bean dip and instantly regretted it. It was so bland and so un-queso-y that we pushed it away and waited for our entrees.   I ordered vegetable fajitas which you THINK you couldn't mess up. Oh, guess what? Yeah. My friend ordered some shrimp dish that I refused to try so I'm not sure if it was good or not.   I wouldn't eat here again unless the world was wiped out by an atomic bomb and only because the food here would survive.",

I liked the pond with the ducks out front. When we first walked in, I was hit with the smell of toilet water, like the floors had been mopped with dirty water. Not very appetizing. Fortunately the hostess walked us out across the patio to a different building. It smelled more like food over there so that was a good sign. After we were seated, we waited for quite some time before anyone came to greet us, take our drink order, or bring chips & salsa. We were actually contemplating leaving right before our server walked by and said she'd be right with us. When she came to get our drink order, we also ordered our food since we'd had plenty of time to decide. I went with the chicken enchilada, black beans, and rice. The bowl of chips and bowl of salsa were huge. That was different. The first couple of chips I had were underwhelming because they were cold, but then I got to some warm chips that tasted much fresher. It's a very noticeable difference. The food came out rather quickly, which was surprising considering how long it took to be acknowledged in the beginning. I enjoyed the rice & black beans. The chicken in my enchilada reminded me of canned chicken. It really didn't have a lot of flavor. The enchilada relied on the red sauce for taste and I wasn't very impressed. Also our last water refills tasted odd, like it shared a spout with some variety of lemonade that got mixed in with the water. Not good. But I'm glad I had a chance to remind myself what Aunt Chilada's food is like. I see no need to drive out to the east valley to eat here again.",

I love Mexican food and could eat it literally every day - but I found this to be a very very Americanized version of Mexican food.  It was \"Eh\" - not bad, not great...just \"Eh\". The best part of the meal were the chips, they were delicious and the salsa was amazing.  I like spicy food and the salsa delivered - but everything else was so mild and just forgetable. There were a lot of us in the group and our food kept coming out in waves.  The first batch of people served started eating and were more than half way done their meal by the time the third wave was served.  I believe our large group plus the large number of diners that were already there very likely overwhelmed the kitchen staff.  We had a reservation, perhaps they could have scheduled a few more people.  The server herself was good, she was on the spot with drinks, refills and more chips.  I don't know how much the bill was because the check was picked up by my boss, but if I were paying for dinner, I don't know that I would come back here if other options were available.",

With sho so many great examples of good American American-style Mexican food in the surrounding environment of Phoenix Arizona, there's just no excuse. I had actually hoped that it might be authentic Mexican, but it couldn't be farther from that. I think the sole reason that this place exists is because of the nearby hotel. It would definitely fail in an environment where It did not have a captive audience. I guess the big bar seem to be an attraction also because there were a whole lot of drunk idiots wandering around. The chips were disgusting. The salsa was boring and flavorless. The enchiladas were loaded with so much poor quality cheese that I may as well have been eating a candle. What a regrettable experience overall. Go anywhere else if you have the chance.",

Food was mediocre at best, but my beef is not with the kitchen. FOH! Listen up, if you screw up on a tab and have to void anything, be HONEST and advise the guest they may see this transaction on their account and YOU apologize for simple mistake and everyone goes on with their life. What you don't do, is mess up and have 2 incorrect amounts ran on the guest's card and they have 2 call you the next day to figure out why they've been egregiously overcharged. Furthermore, you do not only disclose the mistake once the guest gets upset than tell her you assume it will fall off the next day. It did not. Day 2, I get the pleasure of talking to a twit named Lindsey who offers the credit department's number so I can figure it out. I disagreed. In the end, I'm still waiting for the right amount to be debited and reimbursed for THEIR mistake. Don't eat here. Hospitality is not in their vocabulary. If you experienced 1/8th of this shenanigan at my restaurant.... oh wait, you wouldn't. So dumb.",

Both locations have great atmosphere and are inviting although this one, less so as well.  I called ahead for reservations just in case and was told they don't take them.  Luckily, it was not very crowded when I showed up so reservations were not needed.  The restaurant however filled up within a half an hour so I'm glad I didn't have to wait for a table.  My dinner guest and I chose to sit in the outside patio area which is very colorful and spacious.  Service was pretty good.  We were greeted relatively quickly although there was a delay in taking our order.  I ordered what I typically order at a Mexican joint in order to compare it to similar dishes elsewhere . . . chille relleno and a tamale.  Sorry to say AC's relleno is average at best . . . it didn't jump my taste buds seeming rather bland and lifeless despite a mildly spicy green sauce.  The tamale was dry and had an unusual taste that was not particularly pleasant or familiar.  The upside was the service.  My dinner guest was an intellectually disabled woman I mentor for Special Olympics . . . she is somewhat child like and believed that her relleno which she also ordered, was \"too spicy.\"  Our waiter graciously replaced it with a milder selection and did NOT charge us for the first dish.  With all the fabulous Mexican eateries in Arizona, I wouldn't waste my time or money with AC.  There is nothing special about it although the other location may have some historical significance.",

We almost walked out but since she's been here before I said I want to try it before I judge a place. Wish we would or just left.   This place doesn't have a welcoming feeling, staff was ok but something seemed odd.  Let's rate the food..  Their chips and salsa I would rate a 1 Chips were cold and hard seemed like they were sitting there all day and gave us left overs. After reading other reviews I saw that this is a continuous issue with this place.  We ordered their fajita .. For what you pay it's def not all that, I mean you can never go wrong with a shrimp fajitas however this wasn't anything special and we will not be coming back here.  Everything was over priced and food was disappointing wish they would make some changes as this place has good potential and the decorations are pretty neat.",

Starting with a pile high of chips (that kept getting refilled), salsas and guacamole, we almost filled up on that. But...we kept going. (The spicier, darker salsa is outstanding).  I spied street corn and buzz sawed through that so happily that I was humming and dancing in my seat.  We ordered a mix of different fajitas and other items...and we thoroughly enjoyed it all. I realized that after I ordered the fajitas that they had street tacos....so I would go back to just try those out. Authentic flavors, textures and fresh ingredients.  Our server was awesome.",

That was disappointing. I'm used to the pollo fundido at Valle Luna, where I have to put in less effort and just have to shovel food into my mouth. When you're hungry that's all you should be doing anyway! Regardless, the food was good and I wasn't disappointed in the end.  The interior is decently decorated and the customer service was not memorable, but not terrible.",

    "text": "Good food. The mild salsa is CHUNKY heaven. The chips are nothing special...just a crispy delivery system for great mild salsa!  My Husband usually orders Huevos Rancheros but they don't serve egg dishes here, so he ordered the Sonoran House Salad ($10). It looks like a large enough salad to fill me up but he says he's still hungry!  He did NOT add chicken to it. Perhaps with added protein it would be more filling. It comes  with a sweet/tart dressing that is EXCELLENT.   I ordered a Chile Rellano  a la carte ($5) with extra shredded lettuce. This was a delicious Rellano. Traditionally roasted pepper stuffed with cheese, dipped in a light batter and fried. It is served with a delicious green sauce.   I noticed all the neighboring tables were full of combination plates that all looked delicious. All the food here looks good. The combo plates are ranging around $14. So this is not a budget restaurant but it's reasonably priced.   We couldn't resist the fried ice cream ($8) so that bumped our very reasonably priced lunch up a bit! However it's a very large scoop of ice cream. And after it's rolled in corn flakes she swears it's really dipped in the fryer!  It looked it...but not long! It is smothered in whipped cream topped with both chocolate and caramel sauces. It EASILY FEEDS 2 DESSERT LOVERS. She said 4 can share. I suppose so. It's very satisfying with the thin crunchY shell it is served on!  It's much larger than the picture ONLINE. Im officially stuffed and my husband is now FULL!   The atmosphere is lovely. The prices actually seem VERY reasonable for this level of charming ambiance!  It's January and people are enjoying the outdoor dining patio!  The service wasn't overly attentive however we didn't need anything special and we weren't in any hurry, so it was fine. We did arrive at prime lunchtime. If you're in a big hurry I recommend you tell the hostess seating you and also your server when you first arrive!    If you find this review useful, please vote!",

The rice was delicious wow was fantastic it's hard to find good home rice and the refried beans were perfect! If this establishment was in Los Angeles or Hollywood it would do so well!!  Can't wait to visit Arizona again to eat this delicious food! Highly recommend the jalapeno cream chicken! It will rock your world!",

The only soup served was a tortilla soup which was also just warm. None of the food seem to have any flavor or seasonings...Taco Bell seasons their good more! One of the dishes we sent back was still on our tab along with one that were never received. The dining area was a little  pod away from the main entrance with no restrooms. The floors were covered in tortilla chips... nobody was cleaning up between diners. The waiting area for seating offered chips & salsa, but there were no tongs for the chips & people were using their bare hands to serve themselves chips... Needless to say,  this was a very disappointing & unpleasant dining experience!",

Then once you walk over the bridge you are greeted by a hostess with no words.  I guess that means you were not greeted.  But don't worry her handbag and cell were placed back into her shelf under the host stand and a few rolls of silverware were thrown together in the meantime.  Normally I would have walked at this point but their molchajete looked promising.  That friendly gal seated us at a table next to the kitchen door.  Makes sense right, only five to seven tables taken in a three room restaurant.  The table was so wobbly I thought my drink my take off to some other table.  But wait, ten minutes in and we never received waters.  Under my breath I say to my family 3-2-1 and they know what that means.  I am not tolerating another minute of this.  Oh and two cheese enchiladas was the special for $12.50, burritos are $15 and kids meals are $7.95.  The molchajete was $29.99. House margaritas $10.",

    "text": "Sadly this PHX icon of Mexican fare, established in '86, has slowly gone down hill across the last 10 years. Darcie and I used consider an Aunt Chilada's outing a special treat.  The short story: If you are staying at the fabulous AZ Grand Resort and Spa... WITHOUT A RENTAL CAR, walk over and have lunch or dinner. Based on the reviews, cost vs quality will be a roll of the dice. If you're not staying at the Grand Resort or you DO have a rental, there are far too many superior options within 15 minutes. Go find one.  The longer story:  Aunt Chilada's now ranks among the sad cavalcade of Mexican joints that seem top notch by appearance, but phone it in on the execution. By that, I mean, the decor gives the impression of authenticity, the service is fine, but then your food arrives; and proud Aunt Chilada's history aside... food quality here has slipped into the unacceptable zone.   It started with the bland chips and salsa (queue the Jaws music). Both the standard and the \"hot\" varieties were muted in taste. Then came my Numero Uno combination plate. I had ordered a shredded beef taco, and Bean Tostada, and for an extra 2 bucks or so, I ditched the standard Cheese Enchilada and upgraded to a Red Chile Beef Tamale. The taco was watery (huh?). The tamale was bone dry, desiccated... As I dumped salsa on it to make it more appealing, I marveled at the spectacle of its moisture absorption capacity. They should make smaller versions for pharmaceutical applications and larger versions to blow across the screen in post-apocalyptic Westerns... yup that was a Tumble Tamale joke... apologies. The tostada was the stand out. Let me repeat that, among a shredded beef taco, a red chile beef tamale, and a bean tostada... the tostada was the best.  Reviews of former favs in decline make me a bit sad. Just to totally frame things up, this review is not a capricious curmudgeonly slashing. In fact I was predisposed to having a great time at Aunt Chilada's. I was listening to my daughter talking about a post-grad athletic scholarship offer she recently received. An opportunity cut a big chunk out of the master's tuition?... dad was aglow, otherwise this review may have been a 1 Star.   Aunt Chilada's I'll try again in a year or so. I hope 2019 sees you right the course and return to your former consistent greatness.",

I was thinking three stars as I left but that was until I ate my left overs!!! I think I filled up on chips and salsa/hot sauce (and I burnt my taste buds by mixing too much hot sauce with the salsa) and I didn't fully appreciate the taste and quality of my food!!!!  I ordered a shredded beef taco and enchilada combo. I was offered my choice of TWO interesting sides. I picked the \"charro\" beans (I think...they are the pinto beans with, in this case, LOTS of extras and AMAZING FLAVOR!!!). I highly recommend these bad boys!!! I picked the Spanish rice as my other side and I did NOT regret that choice. The taco was better or similar to my favorite other spots. NO complaints about the deep fried shredded beef taco!   By the time I got around to eating my enchilada, my taste buds were burnt from my request for HOT sauce to mix with the tasty salsa, and I didn't taste the AMAZING flavor of their red enchilada sauce at the time!! WOW, when I heated my leftovers up, the flavors POPPED!   The charro beans.....WOW!!! There is depth to the flavors that I cannot fully explain, but I can say there is a smoky flavor and a bacon flavor that makes my tongue SUPER happy!! These are the BEST charro beans I have tasted!!!  What I DON'T LIKE:  They do not have ANY booths. My dining experience is WAY better when I sit at a comfy booth!! They do have some awkward seating, such as the room to the left when you first enter the building. Too open to dozens or hundreds of people who are checking in to dine. I think they should close the area off a bit. Fortunately we were not seated in that room. HOWEVER, the area that we were seated had tables a bit too close for MY comfort. A family of four sat nearby and they were SO LOUD that it was uncomfortable!!! Fortunately, I have a SUPER effective \"stink eye\" that let them know that they were out of line and they decided to use their inside voices. GEEZ PEOPLE, be CONSIDERATE of other diners nearby, especially if you are sitting super close to others trying to enjoy THEIR company and THEIR food!!! YOU are not so special that others sitting nearby want to hear YOU. WTH is wrong with people these days????   Bottom line is, I look FORWARD to going back!!",

Once seated, we were forgotten for close to 20 minutes.  Finally chips, salsa and waters arrived. Decent salsa.  The beef was not referred to as \"steak\" for any of their selections. Might have been a subtle tip that the meat quality is off. And, that's polite. Was it even beef? Not sure. Where was it cut from? The serving staff didn't know when asked and didn't seem inclined to go find out.  It was so bad that more than 3/4ths of the meals were left uneaten. No \"to go\" boxes. No thank you. Eew. Take it away! And, no interest in going for a dessert. Every good meal deserves a dessert to cap it off, right?  North Phoenix, here I come.",

Table side guacamole was fresh but lacked \"flavor\" a bit more lime juice and a lot more cilantro would have made it lovely (who doesn't just love fresh avocado)?!  I had the beef taco and enchilada, my boyfriend ate most of it since he ordered the street tacos and was underwhelmed.  I do not like rice and beans so I cannot comment.  El Diablo margarita and Modelo Especial enjoyed :)",

    "text": "I live in the neighborhood, so Aunt Chilada's is always a convenient option for Mexican. The hardest part is getting past the name, which sounds about as authentic as Taco Bell.  My wife and I stopped in on a Monday night, and the place was packed with people from far-off places like Buffalo, New York. I can't imagine these gringos know much about the great Mexican food here in Phoenix, so Aunt Chilada's is a passable ambassador, especially for the spice-averse.  We opted for immediate seating at the bar and dove into the chips and salsa, which really can hold their own alongside the best in Phoenix. Couldn't order guacamole without tomatoes (my wife is allergic), but the fresh Dos Equis Lager drafts made up for it.  I got the pollo fundido, grilled chicken smothered in cheese and cream sauce. Other restaurants add some spice to their fundido, but I had to make do with a single smoked jalapeno served on top. While the sides of noodles and black beans were piping hot, the entree was approaching lukewarm, and the accompanying tortillas barely held together. Still, I was craving something along the lines of Macayo's Baja Burro, so I enjoyed the fundido in spite of the temperature issues.  The bartenders were friendly enough, but the place lacks the upbeat vibe of a place like Macayo's. Chalk it up to the average age of the patrons or the awkward parking situation.  I live close enough to this Aunt Chilada's that I'm sure I'll be back. Next time, I hope it's just for drinks and chips. If I have to eat dinner, though, it's definitely not the worst.",

I was greeted by a surly young man who may have awakened on the wrong side of the universe.  I asked for a well-lit area, and he seated me near a window.  Daylight was fast fading, as I was quickly served homemade chips and salsa.  The salsa was uninspired and bland.  The server, Samuel, was prompt and made a couple of recommendations.  I tried the pork fajitas.  By now the sun was down, and when the food arrived, it was so dark at the table, I could barely distinguish the pork from the veggies.  It was good, but I like to be able to see my food.  The candles at the table were sorely inadequate.  I asked Samuel about the lighting, and he said only the manager can change it and he/she had gone home already.  I was the sole diner in that dining room, BTW.  There were others in another part of the restaurant that I could hear, but couldn't see.  I left over half of my meal there, just because I couldn't see any longer what it looked like.  Very disappointing.  I wouldn't return to this restaurant.",

Manager made no apology but did explain that the server in my area was new but wouldn't be around for long.  I asked what good that would do me now.  She said no good.  Worst experience ever!

I actually felt like my wallet got gang-raped for the experience: one dinner + one quesadilla appetizer + three margaritas = $60. What in the hell is that!? It would be one thing if the food was amazing.... but the so-called green chilis in my quesadilla were cut up raw mild boring jalapenos that added absolutely zero to the food (but cost an extra $2). The poor downtrodden quesadilla soon sweated an enormous pool of grease, which soaked its entire underside, rendering it inedible. One of my friends passed around a guac appetizer, and the raw onions in there would either put hair on your chest or singe it clean off, not sure which. Blech!  I will add a 1/2 star because the margaritas were tasty. Either they used high end tequila, or there was no booze at all in there. For the price, I would hope it was nice tequila. Clearly, since I can't really tell either way, there wasn't much in there. I could also go so far as to add a half star for the ambiance. Total old-school Arizona touristy kitsch, and the patio was very nice for our group gathering. However, with the preponderance of wonderful places with outdoor seating, I doubt the patio alone would ever lure me back. See ya at Los Dos!",

The food prices vary depending on the hour. We just made it before 4pm so our food was only $3! At 4pm it goes up to $4 and at 5pm it goes up to $5 which is still an awesome deal! The enchiladas were great! It comes with 2 normal size enchiladas and a little salad garnish. We mixed a chicken and cheese and the sauce was super yummy! I grew up in Southern California so I know my Mexican food. The chips and salsa were some of the best I've had. I may have gotten one semi-stale chip out of the huge bowl I ate. We also had a cheese crisp (which they don't have in CA) and although those are always a little plain for me normally, that excellent salsa slathered on there made it AWESOME! The bartender was cool and chatted with us as did a woman at the bar eating alone and one of the regulars was also very friendly. The bar is small, however, so I almost hate to let the word get out on this hidden gem because you better make room for me when I come back. The outdoor patio looked super fun & colorful to hang out on when the weather cools down. I enjoyed the ambiance of the whole place! I had intended on trying a chili relleno but I was too full on the happy hour bargains. I asked the bartender if there was chicken in it like one reviewer said and he said no. Everything we had was so good that I have no doubts the rest of the food is good. I can't wait to come back!",

I was forced to edit and downgrade my rating because of my most recent visit.  Though the service was quite good, the food was horrific.   Was there again recently with some folks from work. It was chosen since it was close to the hotel our corporate visitors were staying. I decided to forgo the usual safe burro and try the chile relleno and the spinach enchilada. O...M...G...what a mistake.  The spinach enchilada consisted of a limp tortilla filled with frozen spinach and covered in a sauce that if it wasn't from a can was seasoned with tin...ha...ha. The relleno was stuffed with queso, breaded, deepfried, covered with the same tin flavored sauce, which in turn was then covered again with rubbery white cheese. Oh boy!  What a treat!  After this meal I have made a vow to never to stray from a burro here again.   So, if you plan on getting together with a big group for Happy Hour, Aunt Chilada's is an OK choice.  If you are looking for truly top flight Mexican food, there are other places that may be more appropriate.",

She thought it was so cool that she brought out a little chocolate cake for us, free of charge. It was a huge serving and very tender and smooth.   This would be good for a wedding reception as their banquet room next to the restaurant is huge. They skimped big time on the bar. It's a sad little nook to the side, hardly elbow room at the puny stool table.   And oh yeah - the food is kinda bland here. Just your average Mexican restaurant that seems to thrive only on account of it being off the I-10.",

I ordered the Patron margarita with liqueur and lime juice  because I dislike the house kind that comes from a mix, but this one still didn't taste 100% homemade (like they cut it with a little mix or something). The chips and salsa were just ok.   This place is nice for it's convenient location next to the Arizona Grand, but I was a little disappointed by my visit. Good I suppose if you want very Americanized Mexican fare.",

The food was fairly bland and not very flavorful and the chips and tortillas seemed to not be very fresh. However, the one redeeming factor is their quesadillas are huge and they don't skimp on the cheese.   This place is fairly average and you won't impress any dates here.

I've been dining here for 6 years, since it's down the street from our office, and it's still a great place to go for a quick lunch or after work cocktails.   The service here is friendly, attentive and quick. I made a reservation for lunchtime for a party of 8 and we were in and out of there in under an hour! The food was served hot and delicious. And the best part was they treated our co-worker with a birthday cake, which we laughed at, because the lunch was set up because he was leaving our company. We had played along anyway and he enjoyed his delicious flan birthday treat.   I've tried many dishes here and they are all so good. The pollo fundido is delicious and the burritos will last you for days because they are huge portions. But my favorite part of the dish is the pinto beans and rice. So good! And the nachos are always served hot and the most flavorful salsa in town.   It's not in the most desirable locations, but well worth a visit if your in the South Mountain area.   The outdoor patio is not the best, I'll have to agree. The seats are pretty low and there seems to be birds feeding from the berries in the trees, because we would constantly get hit by a berry and at one point a bird pooped on our menu. So try to get a seat in the patio away from the entrance and the large tree sitting there. But on a beautiful spring day, it's the perfect place to be to watch the sunset and enjoy a margarita!",

When the food finally came out, they forgot components of some of the dishes. Street tacos were boring - had better tacos at any of the 'bertos. My buddy had the fajitas and he said the chicken was so dry and tasteless he couldn't even eat it. To boot, it was way overpriced, probably because they are connected to the Arizona Grand resort. Half my party got sick later that night. Horrible experience, and not much has changed in 20 years.",

    "text": "First of all, I must say, Connor is by far the most wonderful server I have ever had. Second, this is the most tasty and high-quality mexican food in the area.   When we first arrived at said restaurant, our wonderful server by the name of Connor greeted us warmly with a big smile (and very charming dimples). The young man took us to a nice table by the windows that overlooked the pond, where we captured the moments of young ducklings following their parent ducklings. Very serene moments to enhance our dining experience.  Connor took our drink orders: I asked him about each of the margaritas, and proceeded to choose the \"Sangria-rita\", a creative collaboration of sangria and a margarita. It was very tasty, Connor made a great recommendation. My two friends each got the house margaritas; one frozen, one on the rocks; and only one with salt. Surprisingly, despite how busy the restaurant was (it was about 15 after 5p.m.), Connor returned with our margaritas almost immediately. Go Connor! *High-five*  Next, Connor informed us about the table-side guacamole, which we decided to order. He came back with an entire set-up: about four avocados, diced onion, cilantro, tomato, lemon and lime, salt and pepper, and some cheese for the cheese lovers out there (I do not prefer cheese in my guacamole). He made the guacamole exactly to our preferences and held a wonderful conversation with us the entire time. Such a dapper young man!  We proceeded to order our entrees, which were also delicious. Connor recommended the chicken chimichangas and the beef enchiladas, which were both incredible and served sizzling hot.   Overall, we were very pleased with our experience. We especially loved our server, Connor; who not only made sure we enjoyed our dinner, but our experience as a whole. If you ever go dine there, ask for Connor. He has strawberry-blonde hair, dimples, eyes as blue as the water surrounding the restaurant, and a wonderful smile.  Next time we are on this side of town, we will undoubtably be visiting this location again (and requesting Connor as our server)! Loved our experience.",

My husband and I ate here last night however, and I will NEVER, EVER go back.  Where to start... Wow.  The server was obviously very agitated because she had too many tables and it was awful, terrible, horrible service.  The Mexican shrimp cocktail, which I loved 4 months ago, was so on-fire spicy that I couldn't eat it (I *love* spicy food, not a wimp at ALL).  Almost everything was heavily over-spiced, whether it was too hot, too salty, etc.  We literally left about 85% of our food uneaten and the server didn't ever even check with us to see if the food was OK or if we needed anything.  She picked up the full dishes without even asking if anything was wrong.    Ugh.  I could go on with a huge list of what was awful about this experience but I guess saying that the food was awful, the service was awful, and the ambiance was awful probably says it all.  I know that the Arizona Grand resort owns this location now (not sure how long that has been the case), and I don't know if that's what happened here but I will definitely never be back.",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by aunt chilada's. I usually steer clear of restaurants that my fellow yelpers rate so low. However, it was my friend's birthday and this is where she choose. I started out with a rum runner that was very much on the pricy side, $9. It was strong, I wasn't expecting to get half my money's worth but I definitely did.  The chips were brought out quickly and I was given a mild salsa and a spicy salsa. They were both really good. That's always my favorite part of Mexican restaurants.  I'm not always a fan of Mexican food unless it's authentic. Most places, are too Tex mex for my liking. I ordered the special, a 6 oz steak with a cheese enchilada, black beans, and rice. I ate it all. It could have been the rum runner, but this was by far one of the best Mexican places I've eaten at.  They also brought out a free birthday dessert with a candle that was delicious and big enough to share. The service was good, but it's a bit too pricy for what you get. I think because  it's so close to the Arizona grande resort they price gouge. We didn't have reservations, but it was only two of us. It looked big enough to accommodate big groups and had many tables. The patio tables look lovely when if starts to cool downs.",

The server was efficient and the manager who seated us tried his best to find a quiet table for us (didn't find one, but he tried). What I didn't like: the restaurant is loud. The coffee was instant coffee! Yuck. The food was bland. And the worst part, the cost is pricey. I will go to Barrio Queen from now on when I want Mexican food and great coffee. However, Barrio Queen is as noisy. Both restaurants require a megaphone to hold a conversation at your table.",

Although there were plenty of tables inside and outside that were available when we arrived, but we waited for nearly half an hour to be seated. But at least they had a waiting area with chips and salsa for us to eat while we waited. Once we finally were seated though the service was really good and we had a very nice waiter. The scenery outside was very cool and i loved all of the colored tables, chairs, etc. There also were a family of ducks that were just walking around outside that the employees told us were always there. Before we ordered food we were brought chips and salsa that you could tell was freshly made that I very much enjoyed. I ordered an shredded chicken enchilada and it can with a side of rice and refried beans. It was very good and very filling. They give you a very decent amount of food for what you pay. But overall I would recommend this restaurant and the overall experience.",

My wife, two friends, and I wandered over and were met with a 20 minute wait which I thought was a good sign.  My wife and one friend ordered specials while the other two of us ordered the three taco meal. The score ended up with the specials winning but the tacos did not. My tacos were LUKE warm and very dry like they had been sitting too long. The double stacked corn tortillas couldn't hold up and fell apart.  Extraordinarily disappointed.  Having been a westerner and now an easterner I was looking forward to really good Mexican. This didn't get me there.",

Asked her to move us to another area so that we could hear ourselves talk. She seemed a little upset on the ask. By again we are the customers that are choosing your establishment. Then we waited for about 10 mins before we were approached by our server who told us she would be back in a moment. Waited another 5 mins before she came back. Took our drink order and then was gone again. Waited another 5 mins for our drinks(she did not have that many tables and lost of them we're leaving). Dropped off drinks and then said would be back for our food order. Waited another 10 mins for her to come back and take that. Both the appetizer and our meal came out at the same time. After she asked us if we wanted the appetizer first?? The food was very bland and very clean overpriced. The salsa was not up to par or the chips. I have been to better Mexican restaurants than this and now I remember why I never came back the last time I tried this place out. Has potential but definitely not worth it when there is hella lot better restaurants than this place and not overpriced. The price and service and atmosphere alone shouldn't even get 2 stars.",

On the positive side our server stopped by our table right away with a huge bowl of crispy chips and two large bowls of salsa. We ordered two patron margaritas that came pretty quickly and were good, although clearly not made with fresh juice.  As for the food, its a bit on the mass market side in terms of taste and flavor and certainly not the authentic Mexican I was hoping for.  Perhaps I've just gotten spoiled by the number of great new places serving fresh exciting Mexican food.  If you have kids and are looking for something mild, then this could be the place.",

My husband and sister in law had the chimichanga and devoured it, mother in law loved the chicken tortilla soup. We ordered sopas for dessert, and they are made fresh and hot so they accommodated my request to leave off the cinnamon & sugar.  Overall food and service were fantastic. I left off one star only because the prices are higher than most Mexican places, but the portions were HUGE, and my street tacos had a ton of meat on each one.",

Our appetizers arrive quickly, the street corn was bursting with flavor! Although our actual meal was delayed, the service and compensation for the delay made the experience a positive memory. The entire table partook in the \"birthday\" dessert. Worth 4+stars",

    "text": "I was surprised to see the three stars on yelp considering how busy this place is, but three stars is right on the mark.     When I saw the sizzling molcajete on the menu, no reviews from previous diners would have stopped me. But when we arrived at 8:00 pm on a holiday weekend Sunday, the restaurant was less than half full after their rush hour. We thought we would be seated immediately, but us and three other parties ahead of us waited 45 min.   It immediately became apparent that the restaurant is poorly managed and understaffed, at least it is at 8:00pm. Although the servers and hostess were friendly and did what they could, the place was a disaster.  It appeared as though they hadn't staffed the restaurant appropriately for the holiday, or they let servers go home after the dinner rush.   The waiting area had dirty chips and salsa bowls everywhere and looked like no one had cleaned or picked up plates all night.   We waited patiently for 45 min for a table for 2 after they told us the wait was 25 min. Service was ok from our server. But the sizzling molcajete, which is one of their specialties, was not only not sizzling, it was cold in parts. Big disappointment.   I'm sure there is something that is good to eat here considering the huge crowds. Be sure you get a reservation otherwise the wait will be over an hour for dinner.",

Let's start with the drink order...if you can't remember something...write it down...maybe then it wouldnt take 2 people and 3 attempts at getting it right..sprite vodka and grenadine...how you managed to get root beer out of any of that I will never Marsha, I will never know! Then you disappear before we order food! Finally get to order the rest of the drinks for the table (had to send 2 back..tasted awful) and some apps...then you were hard to find once again Marsha! Finally we were able to find you (yes...we went looking)and ordered the food some how from you not writing things down our order got messed up...go figure right?! Not such a great first impression...I'll stick to taco bell for my Mexican food from now on!",

The service (shout out to our waitress Ashley) was excellent!  She truly appreciated our business and had a vested interest in our dining satisfaction.

    "text": "We went to Aunt Chilada's hoping to get a lite lunch. We weren't that hungry but the place looked inviting from the street. Once inside the hostess greeted us with a smile so we were off to a good start. But its all downhill from here. We told her \"two for lunch please\". We noticed the high-top tables in the front area were empty yet she led us out the back of the building and into another building at a VERY small table against the wall that barely seats two. We were next to a party of 12 having some kind of business/lunch meeting. Very awkward. Our server came and without greeting us handed us the menus and asked for a drink order. We hadn't even looked at the menu yet. We both said water because she appeared to be in hurry, yet the place was not busy. We scanned the menu looking for the \"Lunch\" section. Nothing. Ok, she must have given us the wrong menu. When she returned I asked for the \"Lunch\" menu and she said \"You have it, its the same as dinner.\" Ok, give us a minute. We looked at the party of 12 and their plates were HUGE. We didn't want a huge $50.00 lunch just something lite. So we decided to split one of their burrito dinners.  Even that was going to be too much food for lunch. We could tell the server was a little irked when we told her we were going to split the burrito dinner. The food came in about 3 minutes! So much for freshly prepared. She didn't bring an extra plate so we placed it in the middle and dug at it from both sides. Very bland!. Plate had more beans than rice. The tortilla chips were plain and unsalted. She came back with the check and I noticed there was a $1.00 charge on it for enchilada style. What??? Maybe that was for the extra plate we didn't get. We paid the check and left a small tip. Never going back.",

The service was attentive and helpful. The most exciting discovery was on the dessert menu. They have sopapillas!!!!! Having grown up eating the Mexican/New Mexican food in Colorado and New Mexico sopapillas were a special part of every meal. I was shocked when I found that California and Arizona do not follow that fabulous tradition. Hence, my 20+ year quest to find good sopapillas without having to drive to Santa Fe. To say I am delighted to find them 5 miles from my home is an understatement. For those unfamiliar, a sopapilla is a flaky piece of fried bread, puffed up into a pillow just perfect for drizzling honey inside. The sopapillas here were perfect. This makes a return visit to Aunt Child's a necessity. Treat yourself to great food and finish with the sopapillas!!!",

    "text": "We went on a Sunday for a late lunch.  No one greeted us as we walked in and we waited there for a few minutes, the bartender glancing over at us once but largely ignoring us the whole time. When the girl came out of the back, she said she was sorry and blamed the computers being down for her not being at the front. She then took us across the patio and into an uncomfortably cold room with a bunch of flies buzzing around. There was a strong smell of chemical cleaners. We were greeted by our server within a few minutes. He asked us for our drink orders (just sodas) and came back a few minutes later with those and our chips with salsa.  The chips were great; fresh. warm, and lightly salted. The salsas, though, tasted jarred and not fresh at all. They were okay; it would've been really easy to just chop up some fresh cilantro and mix it in to give it a brighter flavor. Tasted like Sam's Club salsa.  While ordering, my mom asked if they had any specials and our server paused, looked unsure, and just said \"Uhhh no, I don't think so,\" and then asked what we wanted. After ordering, he came around to top off our drinks and chips somewhat often, but it took 35 minutes for us to get our food with almost nobody else eating at the restaurant.  When our food came, our plates were hot and there was a dried crust on top of my beans; a clear sign of sitting under a heat-lamp for 5 or 10 minutes. I ordered the \"Street Tacos\" with el pastor, carnitas, and swordfish. What little meat was actually on the plate was buried under a massive pile of cabbage, shredded cheese, and red onions. I literally couldn't tell which taco had which meat in it until I bit into it. With no sauce, all of the \"fillers\" on the tacos made for a very dry, veggie-heavy bite. Carnitas was nothing special; swordfish was decent, but had too much spice for the delicate flavor of the fish; el pastor just tasted like someone grilled pork with nothing on it but orange juice. Black beans were alright, but certainly not the best I'd ever had.  My girlfriend had the guacamole on her burrito and said it tasted bland and flat, as though it had been in a refrigerator for a few days. She also said the big chicken burrito she got was \"average\".  When our server came to clear our dishes, I had eaten one taco (the carnitas, out of hunger) and maybe a bite out of the others. He asked if I was finished, I said \"Yes,\" and he just took it without asking if I enjoyed everything as there was still more than half of my food left. If he didn't care or even notice that I didn't eat a big part of my meal, I don't care to bring up the problem, especially when the rest of my experience was so mediocre.  Even while accounting for the computers being down, our server still took a long time to write out the bill and bring it to us. By that time, we were there for 75 minutes and wound up spending 90 there before leaving.  Each time the door opened up (they have two buildings and have to bring food out of one, through the patio area, and into the other), more flies flew in and they kept landing on all of our food and drinks.  The theme is really forced. The colors are obnoxiously bright and some of the decorations look like tacky garage-sale items. The music is really loud (where we were) and some of the songs were really annoying and repetitive.  They bring food out of the kitchen through a tiny hallway next to the bar, around a series of blind corners. This hallway is also where the restrooms are and my mom nearly knocked over a server carrying a huge tray of sizzling food, and she had to back out of the hallway before going into the restroom. The server then came right through the entrance part of the restaurant, forcing people just walking in to move out of the way.  Overall impressions:  Pros:  + Food wasn't terrible + Server was polite + Menu offers a few more traditional Mexican items than your average Americanized Mexican restaurant  Cons:  - Food wasn't noteworthy; maybe a 5/10. What wasn't fresh was boring and what tasted fresh had flaws with flavor and ingredient balance. - Server seemed unknowledgeable and was slow, even with almost no one else dining. - Theme and music got annoying after awhile - Flies buzzing in our faces  Lasting thought: Just another mediocre Americanized Mexican restaurant with more attention to theme and atmosphere than on food and service quality. Not sure on the night-life (the patio would probably be nice and they have a full-service bar), but this early-afternoon meal left me still searching for some classic juicy, tangy, fresh, crunchy, and creamy Mexican food. I could've gone to a hole-in-the-wall Mexican food place, spent 15 minutes, spent half the money, and had the same amount of food on a completely different quality level.  Recommendation: If you want to spend $13 for a plate of average food with average service surrounded by a very forced theme, go for it. If not, look for lunch and early dinner elsewhere. Probably won't come back.",

Specifically I had the enchiladas and they were very dry. There was very little cheese and saucy goodness. For a sit down place I definitely expected more.   The service was good but couldn't make up for the food. I would much rather go to a place like tortilla fish instead next time.",

Nothing was great but worse of all was my salad which was floating in dressing and the waitress just shook it off. She never checked on us and when she came to clear the table she never asked why the salad wasn't even touched. I'm not one to complain but the salad was uneatable.

Then came my \"taco salad\".  I asked if instead of meat I could have refried beans. Okay, so my $13 \"taco salad\" consisted of a shell with iceburg lettuce and a ladel full of refried beans on the top. That's it. Yeah. That's it.  Oh, I did get some sour cream and guac on the side of the plate, but no tomtatoes in the salad, not even a little onion or garnish or anything. Just iceberg lettuce and refried beans poured on top. It was gross!!  And it was $13 dollars!!  Give me a break.  My husband ordered a black bean chimichanga. The beans were soggy and refried style black beans, no flavor or spice, totally boring. The food was seriously terrible and ridiculously expensive. We spent over $30 on that crappy crap of a terrible lunch and will never go back there.",

I do not think they are connected anymore.  lots of parking in the lot. I guess they do not have the great happy hour deals the other one does. We were seated right away, but had to wait a bit for a server. Even though there was only 2 other tables in there at the time.  Anyway our server was nice. She refilled our drinks at just the right time, in fact gave us fresh glasses each time.   Our food was good though not very spicy. It was very average Mexican food. I have to say I like Macayo's much better. We were given chips and Salsa, the chips were nice, warm and fresh, but the salsa was chunky and again not very spicy.   I think they cater more to the Hotel patrons now.  It is decorated very generic,like a quick salp of paint and some cheap artwork. I remember it much different the last time I was here. All in all it was good ,just not great. I do not think we will be back soon.",

    "text": "Aunt Chilada's it is time to hang up the towel..reinvent yourself as a nursing home cafeteria and everyone will be happy.   Your nachos are, well Auntie -they're nasty. The cheese is stringy, the chips stale and the chicken tastes canned..The worst part is all you put on nachos is cheese, beans and chicken - no salsa, no guac, no olives, no onions...Alot of nots.  The hair that was impaled in the cheese is actually not what stopped me from eating...the lack of taste is was haulted me, the hair just confirmed the decision for me.   The margaritas are $8.00 which silly me, made me think that, here in  the land of the sun, where everyone serves margaritas as cheaply as possible, for $8 I must be getting something really special. No, I was wrong.  Nothing special about your cheap tasting tequila and even cheaper mix that is shot off the bartender's gun in a standard pint glass for $8...seriously? 16oz of Mrs. T's and a shot of tequila or rubbing alchohol, everything had the taste of shortcuts at Aunties.   Your bathrooms are dirty and really you have the resort golf crowd not a bunch of rowdies, so its' not them, its you not checking on the faciities throughout the night. And, given that I am paying $8 for margies and $12 for some stale chips, a clean bathroom would have been a nice touch.   Your staff is quite nice and you have plenty of them. So, though you were serving me crap and ripping me off while you were doing it, you were really nice about it. I didn't boher to complain about the hair because if I started with the hair, were would my complaint have ended...again, retirement is the key.   So, Auntie, your mexican restaurant days should be coming to a close. Maybe lay off the booze and consider a buffet style generic mexican food in a nice assisted living facility. This would be your True calling but selling overpriced generic, crap tasting mexican food at the foot of a resort needs to come to a stop - someone is going to get hurt.",

They don't bother that much if you don't feed em. Ordered a grande strawberry margarita. Very good. The salsa wasn't anything special but the chips were fresh. Ordered the 2 enchilada plate with rice and beans, one chx one shredded beef. She order a chx burrito. It took longer than we expected to get the food out but was good and filling. Spendy though for 2 plates and 3 grande margaritas ~$70. I'd go back.",

Just one soda and one cocktail.

Lighting was so dim I could barley see my menu (I'm in my 20's btw...) so we had to move. Our server (Lupe) was on the border of being disrespectful. She has no personality, disappeared for periods of time, didn't fill up my soda, etc. Food was okay but overpriced. When paying for our bill our server NEVER told us that their credit card machines were down. Instead she took our credit card number down manually with the machine. Might have been okay with that if she had of taken two seconds to tell us that was the way they were going to have to do it. I'm not okay with a server being able to copy down my credit card info. Ripped it up and paid cash. Once again zero personality from our server. I wouldn't ever go here again nor recommend that anyone does.",

    "text": "On my grand return to the valley, I was craving Mexican. However, by the time my friends and I got around to eating and stopped chatting, we knew there would be a long line at Los Dos, so we swung by Aunt Chiladas. While it was good, it wasn't fantastic, and I'm not sure I'd do it again.  The first foul was getting there and not realizing the entire front area was a bar/bar seating and not places you can order food (speaking of which, why can't you order food at the bar... ugh). We were then thrown with a 50 minute wait for what seemed like a practically empty parking lot. As starving as we were, we probably ate way more chips than we should have and started in on a pitcher of sangria. By the way, the sangria had no fruit in it.. I think they removed it before they put it in the pitcher. VERY disappointing.   After we were finally allowed to leave the cougar area and head to the main establishment, the food was just meh in my opinion. Interestingly enough when our food came, our waitress brought it out and then just walked away leaving it on the fold out serving tray and not delivering it to our table. The tacos a friend ordered were taunting him horrendously. Mine came with the wrong side dish which meant I had to constantly push it out of the way.   The fried ice cream was good, but not the best I've had.  In the end, this was just a good learning experience...but it was great to be back amongst friends.",
