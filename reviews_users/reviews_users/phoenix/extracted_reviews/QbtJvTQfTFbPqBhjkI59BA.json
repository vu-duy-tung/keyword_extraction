    "text": "Raw chicken wing!!! I was served a raw chicken wings, and expected to pay for it. After having eaten half of the order, I bit into the 6th one and found blood. I wasn't going to risk eating the remaining 3.   I brought it to the witness' attention, and it didn't seem to phase her. So I spoke with the manager. The manager also didn't seem too concerned about my health, and tried to convince me that the chicken wing was fully cooked. After our talk he offered to buy my dessert. But when the bill came, the wings and the dessert were on it. I mentioned it to the waitress, and she brought another bill... With the wings on it. I then spoke with the manager, and told him I wasn't going to pay for the wings... I didn't eat all of them, and I still might get sick from them. Didn't phase him. To be reasonable I offered to pay $4.00 ( $.80 per wing) and he didn't budge.   My business, and that of my friends, doesn't seem to be too important to him. I paid for the wings and won't return.   I wish you a healthy visit if you visit this place, but watch out for the chicken wings!",

Our last trip (and it will be our last trip) was disappointing on all account. We ordered the wings this time since our former favorite cheese sticks have been less than stellar the past two visits. The wings were decent enough. We should've stopped there. We both ordered burgers, medium, with fries and onion rings. The burger had zero flavor, not even a hint of seasoning. They were well done, greasy and just not good. The fries and onion rings were the biggest disaster-a pile of something may have been crispy at some point during the day but was served as a batch of greasy crumbles. Greasy doesn't even describe how bad they were. I don't know if their fryer wasn't hot enough or clean enough. Or both. You'd think they would be embarrassed plating something that horrible looking but clearly they don't care. Based on our past two experiences there we will not be back. It's too bad, they used to be good. They may survive for a little while on the backs of regulars but ultimately this level of quality will catch up with them.",

    "text": "I'm the Duke!!! THE DUKE!!!! OMGWTFBBQ! But no. Duke be not proud. The REAL regulars don't have that obsessive compulsive urge to check in at every little place they just pass through or pass gas at. So yeah - it's the neighborhood bar and I can stumble home from here. What's not to like? And of course, when it's that close you tend to drink a little more - especially when there's no need to worry about a DUI. I have a friend that comes here because he doesn't want to drink alone at home - 'cause THAT means you're an alcoholic. LOL. So he gives me a call and we both come here to avoid being alcoholics. Place is in the same mall as CVS Pharmacy, Chase Bank, and Jimmy & Joe's Pizzeria. As far as the menu - I think their burgers are decent. I stay away from the onion rings though - too thickly breaded for my taste. Pizza slices are decent and so are the wings. Haven't tried any of the salads - maybe someday when that testosterone deficiency kicks in. Haven't tried any of the desserts either - chocolate and beer just don't mix too well. Beers - they have Dos Equis on tap - comes with a slice of lime. Also Blue Moon - comes with an orange slice. Gotta get your Vitamin C somehow, right? Also there's the Zipp's version of margaritas - Zipparitas. As in Zipparita doo dah Zipparita day. All sorts of flavors like watermelon, peach, chambord... Oops. Forgot what the other flavors were... got a disk read error from my noggin - must have had too many of those Zipparitas. Service is always pretty decent. Or maybe it just becomes that way when you start to know the waitresses by name. And they have one of those TouchTunes jukeboxes. Just get the TouchTunes app, find the most obnoxious song in the catalog you can find that isn't filtered for this location and play it multiple times - hilarity ensues. Just kidding. Me do that? No way. Not unless I was hammered or something.",

If you want something to compliment the wings try the chips and guac or the mozzarella sticks which are wrapped in wonton vs. the traditional heavy bread crumbs. Other than that don't stray.  Do, however, give your server a hard time. They're a lot of fun! And do order a Zipparita to wash down your wings.",

No check Backs for refills on drinks. Or food. My boyfriend finished his whole meal by the time the server had come back, while she was talking to the host upfront, very unprofessional.

There are many large screens and a projector for sports fans. If for some odd reason, you bring your kids there are a few arcade games. There is a patio too for those who enjoy tobacco.   If you like, a wide selection of Budweiser products, burgers and sports this may be for you. Otherwise, go find a local brewery.",

There were six of us with five different checks but there was no problems with any of the ordering or billing. I had the quesadilla listed on the appetizer with no onions or jalapenos. It came with sour cream, guacamole, and salsa plus Cajun seasoning and full of cheese. It was very good and filling. Plus it was only $5.50. For desert we got the brownie skillet which I shared with my boyfriend. It was okay but it was too hard...should've just stuck with the brownie with ice cream. Overall it was not bad but not overly impressive. May be back as it is a pretty common place for the group to go. Total before tip was $16.16 for the quesadilla, brownie skillet, and a soda.",

Prior to us arriving my mom was hungry so she put in an order of  Fish. The waitress tells my mom they are going to charge $1.50 for a split charge. The split charge is for items on specials. They were not even going to split the item, the waitress just assumed since only one order was placed. My mom told her it was for her only and then the manager comes out to also tell my mom of the charge. My mother was so annoyed they cancelled the order and paid for the drinks ordered. Let's just say we ended up meeting some where else. #losttwofrequentguests",

I am sure the dressing has a ton of sugar and with all the dried cranberries and candied pecans it is basically like eating salad candy. But hey, it's got to be better for you then the burger and fries, right? They also have really good wings and the golden medium wings is another must order item for me. I wish they would get a better selection of craft beer on tap, though. They do have Blue Moon and usually one or two offerings from Four Peaks or San Tan.",

    "text": "If I could give 0 stars, I would.   A group of 7 of us visited the Ray & McClintock location on Friday 4/8 for lunch for a colleagues birthday. We arrived just at noon, and our server greeted us after about 5 minutes of sitting down, and the experience continued to get worse from there.   About 10 minutes after arriving, we finally received our drinks, and that was that. Our server (says Brooke W on our receipts) did not come back to take our order. I had to approach the manager on duty to get someone to take our order, since we only had a short time period of our lunch hour left. When there was no other servers around, he began to mentally take our order, until the bartender came over into the dining room with pen & paper, after over 20 minutes, during this time, a party that arrived after us, same waitress, was served and orders taken in less than ten minutes from their being seated. After the bartender put in our order, we had to ask the manager and bartender for refills on our beverages as we did not see our original waitress until she delivered our tabs, which we also had to ask for.   We are now 40 minutes into our lunch hour, and now do not even have time to enjoy our meals because everything from that point was so rushed, including an order that was incorrect. I had to then walk up to the manager at the food line once again to ask for the corrected order to go and a box for my food. Once the server was finally bringing over our checks, I had asked for a refill on my water before she even collected the tabs to run our cards. After running all of our cards and finished cashing us out, she then asked if I would like a water to-go.   It was the single most frustrating and worst experience we have ever had at any Zipps restaurant that we have had at this location that we have visited numerous times before today. We will definitely have to reconsider before we return to this location in the future.",

I've gotta say, this was probably not only the worst bar food I've ever had, but it takes the cake of the worst anything I've ever eaten anywhere then handed a check for. I wouldn't have minded the exorbitant prices if I had actually gotten some edible, but over $8 for a quesadilla that looked and tasted like someone threw a piece or two of processed American cheese between 2 tortillas and then popped it in the oven just long enough to completely dry it out was not worth 50 cents, much less what I paid. The rest of my group was no happier, but when happy hour is supposed to be happy, people are collectively reluctant to complain, so we all just moved the food around our plates and vowed never to go back. Don't waste your time here. There's way too many other places in the area to get good food.",

Found our own table and we had to moved the tables ourself to fit our party which included getting extra menus from other tables and place settings. So it didn't start off that great.   Waitress came pretty quickly with our drink orders and I had the Passion Fruit Ice Tea. One word for the ice tea. Terrible. Did not enjoy it at all. No real taste. I was hoping this was just an off day. Anyways, I ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger with Sweet Potato Chips. The burger came with two burger. Sadly, the burger had no taste. Bland. Only thing I could taste was the Swiss cheese and mushrooms. Very uneventful. The sweet potato chips were pretty good. Not too greasy.   So overall, the atmosphere was great but the food was lacking. Took a while for our food to come out too. So the service was what I would call so so. They did refill our drinks on a timely manner tho. I'm not to sure if I would want to come here on my own again.

We got the wings golden style and they were FANTASTIC. A little bit hot with a. Sweet aftertaste. Service was good considering how busy they were.

    "text": "Came here yesterday with a group of friends to watch the ASU football game and this place leaves much to be desired.  The service was okay, not particularly fast or overly friendly, but it wasn't terrible.  The food however, was garbage.  I ordered the club with fries; I could make a better sandwich at my house and the fries were so overcooked that they were crunchy.  I was still hungry after the sandwich so I ordered chips with salsa and \"guac\".  The salsa was generic and clearly not made in house, and the guacamole was half of an avocado kinda mashed up.    They had a few decent beers on draft, but mostly the domestic garbage choices.    If you must come here, I suggest skipping the food and sticking with a beer.",

The golden hot wings were good, just the right amount of spice. There wasn't a large crowd, service was pretty quick. I tried the Ziparita, amazing!! Definitely a must try. The waitress wasn't the best, rarely came around to check if we needed more drinks or food. Overall it was a good experience.",

Their wings get a 5 star for sure and our server, I believe (and hope I have correct) was Jordan, a super nice and bubbly young guy whom I also would like to give 5 stars. He was on top of things and we never had to wait for anything. So, since I had such a great experience over the weekend I decided to do a take out order, which I ordered over the phone. 1) It wasn't ready yet when I got there. 2) I went to the bar to pay for my order and the chick behind the counter acted like I wasn't even there. Served and got everyone else their drinks while I just waited and waited, only needing to pay. It was bad enough my order wasn't ready AND they had to redo parts of it because they screwed up but just because I'm not getting alcohol doesn't mean I should be ignored. If you hate your job, find something else. So...I gave 4 stars for my first experience and 2 stars for my 2nd experience ONLY because their wings are the better of the bars around.",

Every time I've been here, there's been a slight wait. Good thing there's the bar area.   In case you needed a Happy Hour reminder: $1.50 Pizza Slices $2.75 Well Drinks/House Wines $3 Zipparitas (limit 3 -they're good and strong)/Premium Pints (Dos Equis!) $3.75 32oz Domestic Drafts $4 Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole (classic starter) $6 Wings or Chicken Skewers (get the medium GOLDEN wings)  Some downsides of this location are the lack of dedicated parking and the unfortunate patio. The lot wraps around and shares spots with the not-so neighborly CVS. Get here early on game day because it will fill up fast. Also, the patio could be so much more. The TV's were quite aged and inaudible. It is quite obviously a dedicated smoking area. And the smokers are getting no love.",

Why do I do this to myself? I have tried on multiple occasions to speak to management but I keep getting shot down with BS excuses. One lady in marketing literally tried to blame Arizona tax pairs on their poor service. I should screenshot the email and post it on yelp.

Ordered a blue moon when our entrees arrived and it never came, after over 30min and then us being done eating and ready for our check. Manager danced around apologizing and basically said they were busy and couldn't help the slow service. He was a bit condescending and actually interrupted our conversation with him to cheer at the football game. It was obvious he didn't care at all and the conversation with him essentially turned out to be utterly pointless.  Learned a couple days later after my sister emailed Zipps that that Manager quit or was fired. Learned that the server we had quit after that night too, which was unfortunate to hear since it really wasn't her fault at all and she was doing the best she could.  Also, the nachos came with about a full cup or more of sour cream on top and little else. Pretty unappetizing.",

My mom ordered fries and they came out cold so the server got us new fries. Unfortunately, the fries were still not warm. We didn't complain, we just didn't eat them. The server later asked us what was wrong with the fries and my mom told her that they were cold again when they came out. The server kindly apologized. A few moments later, John approached us and my mom kindly told him that she wasn't complaining or asking them to be removed from the bill, she was just stating that they were cold. He proceeded to almost argue with my mom saying that he touched them both times before they came out and that they were hot. First of all, I do NOT want to hear that you are touching the food before it comes out. Second of all, we didn't even complain! He also stated that the fries get cold \"when they just sit there\". They were cold when they came out! The man in the booth next to us leaned over once the manager left and said that they thought the manager was rude to us. His reaction to us was completely unprofessional. We will not be back. Find a manager who has better customer service skills.",

They were wrong so I suggest you check Your bill carefully because if they can charge you full price during happy hour they most surely will.

We actually had a couple bartenders and a manager scoot us out of a seat because they had priority here. I'm sorry but as much as I respect the amazing food and the old Zipps the staff just puts certain people in priority.  I appreciate all the good times and people at the old location and was excited for them to move forward to the new place but they need to get their staffs attitudes in check because if this continues the Zipps  community will crumble again.",

She took our drink order, then it all went bad.... She didn't write anything down. We ordered long island, bloody mary, water, and another long island. The waitress confirmed order by saying, 2 long islands, bud light and water. We of course said no and corrected the bud light to a bloody mary. She left and took a long time for the drinks to come back. The long island was cloudy, my \"long island\" was not a long island at all, it was some tea concoction that the bar apparently makes. I didn't like it, so I tried my friends \"long island\" and I didn't care for that one. Sitting there with no drink to drink we waited for a while until she came back and I said that my drink was not a long island as I ordered. She said it was some kind of tea. I said I ordered a long island so she asked if I would like a long island. I said, well that is was I ordered but the one I tasted was not good. So I ordered the most simple drink I could think of. I said \"absolute and cranberry\" After waiting again the drink arrived and I looked at it and knew it wasn't going to be good. I took a sip and I was right. The color was all wrong. I finally get her attention and regretfully have to tell her that this drink is no good. I asked if it was absolute and she said no it's house vodka. She claimed that I said vodka cranberry, I did not say vodka! I never order just vodka! Gross! She again asked if I wanted what I actually ordered. I said no because the cranberry juice tasted stale and I just was at a loss at that point. I ordered a whiskey sour and she didn't bring it, I assume it was the bartender that did. I tasted it and it was ok...so I drank it anyway and we left.",

The bartender was doing her best to keep up, but she was  slammed. We got our drinks fairly quickly and then took 30 minutes to flag her down to order our food. 30 minutes later we got our food and it was cold. We alerted the bar tender, told her it wasn't her fault, and asked to speak to a manager.  The manager was a complete asshole and all but laughed in our faces. Encouraged us to write a bad yelp review. It was so disrespectful we were shocked. Corporate, please get this guy out of your restaurant.",

Very nice friendly server arrives to take drink order. Explains happy hour program. Well drinks are $ 3.00. I order a Amaretto Sour which she said is ok as a well drink. All bars carry a well Amaretto.  Good I'm not a big drinker and we stopped to drink, $3.00.  Drinks come & so does the full press for food order before I took a sip of my drink or looked at the menu. Wife orders the basket appetizer a small basket of fried junk including onion rings and homemade chips. Delivered along with an order of chicken Skewers, breaded boneless chicken on a skewer.  The Basket food was actually cold enough to believe  it had come out of the fridge not the fryer. I had our server actually hold an ice cold onion ring. She offered a replacement order & we passed.  Ordered a plain burger instead and I ordered 2 pieces of Happy Hour Pizza at $ 1.50 a piece and was told it came with 1 topping.  OK let's wrap it up, Chicken Skewers dry and tasteless like they had baked in an oven for days, the burger was as if it came off a chains $ 1.00 value meal menu, the pizza OK for a sports bar but priced at $2.00 with 1 topping, and the Amaretto Sour on the check came back at $ 4.75 and a poor explanation of why it wasn't a happy hour price.  The other guest ordered a chicken Caesar Salad and had no comment. Never saw a manager who you would think have stopped to apologize for the cold appetizer. Moral of the story there are so many places to spend your hard earned money than Zipps.",

    "text": "Forget it! They have some good menu items, but nothing spectacular. It is outrageously noisy on weekday nights with very few patrons. Zipps in Chandler is trying too hard to be a 20-something Mill Avenue bar, when their week night customers are 30- and 40-year-olds. I expect a noisy bar with loud music on a Friday or Saturday, but who wants to go to a neighborhood bar with your spouse in the suburbs on a Tuesday evening and have to scream over Motley Crue for an hour?   I did mention the volume level to our waitress and a manager showed up at the table within minutes, but don't be fooled. This was all smoke and mirrors. The manager could care less what we really thought and pulled the old, \"is the volume okay now\" trick during a quieter section of the music. He hadn't touch the volume. It was just as loud as it was previously, if not more so. If he wanted to keep the volume at ear piercing levels, he should have just ignored our complaints rather than lie to our faces.   Drive the few minutes out of the way and go to Devil's Advocate! The atmosphere, higher quality menu, and friendly staff are well worth it!",

I ordered the club sandwich and unlike any other club sandwich Ive ordered elsewhere this was pretty much just a turkey sandwich, very little ham and a few small pieces of bacon.  Arent \"club\" sandwiches supposed to be tall double deckers??  This looked like something I would make at home.  Definetly not an $8 plus sandwich.  Hubby had a turkey burger, which again at about $8 bucks looked about the size of a regular hamburger at McDonalds.  Red Robin burgers are a million times better for the same price.  The onion rings were soggy and greasy and most of the batter had fallen off.  One bright spot was the slice of pizza we ordered.  Hubby said it was yummy.  All in all this is one of those places where I just dont get what people like about it.  Food was very blah and not worth the money.  Maybe its good for drinks and happy hour appetizers but dont waste your time or money for a meal, there are much better places to go for less money.",

I have a hard time ordering anything but their chicken fingers because they are extra greasy and so delicious.  But the rest of the menu is decent and I haven't ordered anything bad yet.  They have the Mother of All Brownies on the menu and it is seriously the best dessert I have ever had at a sports bar.  Oh, and there is a hot bartender named Brooke that is pretty entertaining.",

    "text": "If overpriced, tasteless, poorly prepared, greasy food is your thing, look no further.  My visit here was very disappointing.  My dining companion said he'd been here and it was \"good\".  The place is fairly new, nice and clean, well located, easy parking.  Went at lunch time.  It's not hard to find \"burgers\", everyplace has them, so I much prefer to get something other than a burger.  About all that's on the menu is burgers.  I prefer to get a philly cheese steak (beef or chicken) or french dip.  And virtually every \"grill\" prepares at least one of those items.  Not here... nothing to be found but burgers  or a chicken breast in place of the burger.  So I got a grilled chicken breast and selected the \"cajun style\" option.  Also selected onion rings after inquiring whether they used real onions.  Food arrived.  Nothing special to look at.  The chicken breast was really only half a breast.  Nothing \"cajun\" looking about it other then there was a VERY light dusting of cajun seasoning that added zero flavor and just the slightest amount of extra color.  The garnish was one piece of lettuce and a microscopically thin slice of tomato.  If the bun was toasted/grilled (as it should have been) it was not apparent. The chicken was dry and tough requiring a knife to saw thru it.  The onion rings looked good.  That was all that was good about them.  The \"ring\" of onion was very thin, the \"onion ring\"  was almost all breading.  You could hardly taste the onion at all.  The breading had very little actual flavor.  The main flavor of the onion rings (breading) was of grease that should have been changed out 2 days earlier and therefore gave the rings a somewhat rancid off taste, the only real taste.  Perhaps this was a bad day but from the number of other 1 and 2 star ratings I suspect this is just how the place is - management that really doesn't care to go beyond mediocre as long as the people come in.  I've driven by in the evenings and they seem to do decent business so someone must like mediocre uninspired food.  For the same $$ there are much better places within two miles.",

The bar area is loaded with TVs, a pool table (maybe 2 I can't remember), and one of those virtual golf game things. The only thing about the bar area is it's a little loud. The loudness isn't from music or the volume on TVs, I honestly just think it's how the room is built. The decibel level is pretty high in there. There is regular seating to the right of the bar for families or just people who don't like it so loud, next to the regular seating is an outdoor patio as well. The outdoor patio has picnic style wooden tables and offer a great ambiance! The thing that I really respect about this place (as a sports fan) NO MATTER WHERE you choose to sit bar, regular seating, or even the outdoor patio there is always multiple TVs to watch your favorite game on!  Now to the food and drinks!  Their food is amazing! We have been getting the wings a lot and onion rings, both are OUT OF THIS WORLD! We have tried the southwestern chicken sandwich as well, it was 10/10! Everything I see that comes of the kitchen looks fantastic as well! They do have pizza here and is a super thin crust! It looks great! Everything is bought out in record timing!  Now to the beer! It's great and during 3-7pm they have $5 32oz drafts! What a deal.  The servers are so sweet and the manager is the bomb!  What a great place, I honestly couldn't say enough good things about this place!",

I got the pepper jack focaccia. The bone was the size of a tooth pick, seriously no joke, I asked to send it back for a new one. The assistant manger mike came over and said he would make it right. He came back with two options. Option number 1 a five dollar coupon but I still have to pay for the sandwich I sent back. Option 2 he could take it off my bill but if I want a new one he would charge me for it. WTF! Seriously I almost ate a bone the size of a TOOTHPICK !!! I asked to talk to a different manager, so Alexis came over and said sorry sir this all I can do. All I wanted was for them to take it off my bill and give me one that had no bones for free. I could of choked on this bone and died.",

    "text": "Nope.  Newp.  Nah.  No way.  Never again for this location.  We have always patronized the one on south Arizona Ave & Ocotillo, but since we moved north of the 202, we thought we'd give this Zipps a try and watch some football last night.  They have plenty of TVs and we had no problem watching our game.  I'll just break it down to what was good and what was bad.  The good:  our server, Mandy, is 5-star.  She was super nice and helpful, and did the best with what the kitchen gave her to work with.  We also enjoyed the cold pitcher of Alaskan Amber ($12.50) , the pepper jack focaccia ($8.95), and the fish taco ($7.25), which is more like a fish burrito, but those 2 food items were good.  The bad:  We ordered mild golden wings and are pretty sure we got medium regular wings.  We powered through them because we had a pitcher of beer at hand, but they were not correct.  We both used to work in kitchens and try to never send food back.  The onion rings that I used to rave about were awful.  Old, greasy, and floppy.  Just not good at all.  My husband's fish taco came with chips and salsa which were just generic, nothing special, until he got through the 5 or 6 whole chips on top, and underneath those were the chip crumbs from the bottom of the bag.  The person who poured those chips just flat out doesn't care.  Just that simple.  You can't dip crumbs into salsa.  (No shit, Sherlock, right?)   To wind it down and get through the 4th quarter we each ordered a Dewars and water.   Those were both water with a hint, a splash, a sprinkling, a wisp, a shadow, a tuft, a shred, a snippet, a twist...  a modicum, a ghost, a bit, a dab, a dribble, a touch, a mite, a smidgen, a nip, a teeny tiny amount...  a dash, a dinky, dwarfish, puny, shrimpish, undersized, runtish, infinitesimal, wee, sparse, deficient, inadequate amount of Dewars.  $6.75 each.  Total rip off.    Like I said, nope.  Never again.",

    "text": "I really, really wanted to like this place because I just moved to the neighborhood and it's within walking distance, but after a horrible experience I will never visit again.  This was my first visit to any Zipps.  I went in with my girlfriend and we each ordered a beer (one 32-oz for me and one 16-oz for her).  Since we were just a little hungry, we decided to order a single order of fish & chips to share.    When the food came out and we received what looked to be two full orders.  I asked my server (Jordan) why we received two when I only asked for one order.  According to the manager there is a split charge automatically applied of $2 which was not communicated verbally to me by the server, but is apparently noted in super tiny print at the bottom of the menu.  This charge includes providing an extra side which I didn't want as we weren't that hungry.  This charge does not apply to appetizers for some reason, only entrees??  The manager explained the charge exists \"so that customers don't take advantage of the low prices\".  I'm sorry, but any business from a customer is good business and I've never seen the parking lot of this establishment full.  If a $2 extra charge for people sharing an entree is what makes or breaks your business then your prices are not set correctly to obtain the necessary profit margin. I have 3 years of restaurant management experience and this just seems ridiculous.  I requested a side of chipotle mayo with the fries and received Thousand Island dressing instead.  Our waters were never refilled by the server when obviously empty near the edge of the table, the onion rings were very hard, and the fries we received were cold.  The fish was the only redeeming part of the meal which was actually quite delicious!  In an attempt to rectify the situation, the manager offered a free side salad. The salad we received had wilted lettuce and did not taste fresh.  I would have been happier if the $2 split charge was just removed rather than giving me extra food I didn't really want.",

So we have been to many Zipps and their fries are never good but we just make it work with cheese. The waitress brings back the nasty looking cheese that looks like grits. Lol. So I let her know that we have had cheese at another location that was like cheese whiz. She goes and says let me ask. Now first instead of coming back and saying like we don't offer it at this location that would have been a better response. She has the manager come over to say we don't offer that. The manager(old female) then says she has been at Zipps for 15 years. We have never had that. (TIME FOR RETIREMENT) I've been at few that do and some don't. All of that to say, her argumentative nature turned us off. I've been a manager for some years. The better way to say it would have been the way I stated above. Either way they did take off the cheese but now we were stuck with the nasty fries.   Lastly check comes we leave 30 % usually. The waitress said do you need change but, tries to come back with no ones to get her tip higher. The frustrating part was I need the ones for me not you. So since she played that game she got less then our standard. To many games. Never going back to this particular location.",

So, pretty much they have specials all the time. Most nights the wings are on the special for $5 a dozen. Golden wings, mmmmm!!! Those things are insane! There are 32oz beers for like $3 bucks, $8 pitchers of Blue Moon (or any other premiums) on Saturday nights... $3 zipparitas, $3 3 olives, $3 jagers... basically different specials of food and alcohol each night. Their burgers are pretty awesome, too. Oh anddd pizookieee!!! or pizza cookie as they call it here. Yummmm...  This location is bigger than others I've been (Camelback and Via Ventura in Scottsdale). However, the specials are the same at all the locations. The food taste the same also.   They also have pool for $1 each game and a shuffleboard should you wish to play. A music juke box with ehhh... alright songs. Mainly old songs but its nice to browse the selection and play a throwback once in a while. They have TVs all around, too... of course.   Service is hit or miss. Sometimes its great, sometimes its slow but usually when I'm at Zipps I'm with good company and conversations help ease slow service.",

Seriously though, I became a fan of Zipps about two years ago from a friend who took me there.  Im not much a sports bar person, but what the hell.. We hung out, snacked on wings and had a few drinks.  The golden wings, I think they were called, were just delicious.  I wanted to order more, but then I'd come off as a pig.. don't wanna do that.  I would then try their blue cheese burger, which consisted of two patties, and blue cheese crumbles on top.  The thing literally melts in your mouth.  Dessert...  PIZZA COOKIE.  They bring out this piping hot cookie, straight out of the oven, with vanilla ice cream on top.  If there was a dessert in Heaven... this would be it.

Reading other reviews, it seems that I should have tried the golden wings, so I'll put it on my list for next time.  I have only had 2 appetizers, but they weren't good enough to warrant an entree.  It's in a convenient location, and the bar is set apart so that when don't feel like being around kids (no offense), you don't have to. I won't cross it off my list, cause a good bartender is always a good sign.  But, there isn't anything new about it, just another sports bar - which is fine by me.",

At first, it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.  They have some really good specials, but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6. Big misunderstanding, most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings. Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree, and I don't disagree. Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.  The service was really awesome. They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay. I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well. Apparently, they also were understaffed, but it honestly did not feel like it. Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).  Now, I'm not a fan of pizzookie, but wow, their cookie platter was awesome. It wasn't on special that night, but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again. Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter? It's just as good if not better than BJ's.  I am actually excited to go here again. With some really good food specials almost any night, I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of. The food is a little greasy, but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill. Want to lose 50 lbs, go to subway. Props to the owners for such an awesome establishment.",

We went for reverse happy hour and tried the chicado (two ground chicken patties, pepper jack cheese, guacamole & fried onion straws). It was okay - the guacamole wasn't fresh and the bun was mediocre. They have different specials every night so we may come try their other food.",

    "text": "I can't believe I have not written a review bout this place. I have been going here for years (minus the three years in Denver). I love their burgers, golden wings and Focaccias. You have tor try their Philly Focaccia; \"PHILLY CHEESE STEAK FOCACCIA Top sirloin steak flat grilled with cherry peppers, onions, hot peppers and whole milk mozzarella.\" That sounds yummy right now.  Think of it as a fluffy burrito. You would  think that when they hits a home run with the Philly Focaccia they would do the same with their Philly spring rolls, but they don't, they are not that good. Don't kid yourself, this is a sports bar, but they only have tv's outlining the dinning area and of course the bar area, none hanging from the ceiling in the dinning area. I also love that their reverse happy hour starts at 8:00pm. It used have a lot more items, but heck the economy is bad, so the list shrunk. Their reverse happy hour is specifically daily special. Like \"Tuseday Specialty hamburgers for $6.50.\" I don't frequent this location as much anymore (because I live next to the Gilbert location). But make no mistake, I go Zipps two - three times a month and if my wife and I can't agree on a new place to eat, we go to Zipps.  Also, their regualr happy hour is great too. That menu has a much larger selection. I want to give it 5 stars (I really do!), but it can get noisy and some of their other food items I do not care for.",

First, we walk in and seat ourselves and wait 15 minutes till anyone greets us, then, without even welcoming us the first thing she says is \"you know you can't be I here unless you are 21 right? Give me your ID\". I understand checking IDs is important, I have been a waitress before, but I mean demanding and being completely rude without even saying hello is completely unnecessary! Common courtesy is to greet and welcome your customers.....how hard can that possibly be? When we ordered our food she had nothing but attitude when we asked questions about the menu, or if she didn't hear/understand a question she would snap back with a \"WHAT?!\" This girl ruined our experience or interest of ever returning to this restaurant.",

My favorite food here is their mozzarella sticks, extra crispy wings in buffalo hot, and their fries. You also cannot go wrong in ordering a nice cold beer to wash down all the yummy food.

Insanely busy during dinner hours and the hostesses that we saw were clueless and rude. We waited for closer to 20 minutes, and were asked if we would 'mind sitting against the back wall', and I had no idea what that meant. What it means is that you are at a tiny table literally separating the kitchen from the restaurant. It was chaos.  Besides all of that, the food came to us much quicker than I expected and it was delicious. The Monaco focaccia, wings and onion rings were amazing. Their Zipparitas are delicious. Love Zipps but this particular location is not my favorite.",

As a patron of zipps for over 10 yrs, I'll easily say I'll never come back. Nothing was comped, lazy kitchen staff can't put together a salad.

Chicken skewers (basically chicken tenders on a stick with dipping sauces) good pieces of chicken and you get 12 of them so it's easy to share but it didn't have much taste. Pretzels bites had even less taste just kind of spongy and bland the beer sauce needed more beer or seasoning or something. Mozzarella sticks were VERY good not what I am used to almost had a breading like an egg roll crispy and thick. Staff is great food didn't exactly give my taste buds a run for their money.",

This past week my husband again asked to meet at Zipps and I met him.  He again ordered wings. I ordered a turkey sandwich which I asked to be \"reubenized\" which they'd take off the original toppings and instead add sauerkraut and 1000 island dressing.  (It's on the menu!) For my side I asked for sweet potato fries.   I guess I assumed it would be on a bun instead of between two slices of toast.  It was a pretty big lump of sliced turkey, which in that way they delivered, but I was just not excited about it. It was basically something I could have made better at home.  Dont' ever order chips at a bar unless you know they make them (like Oreganos). I could tell that they were at the bottom of the bag with my sweet potato chips.  I literally ate maybe 10 full chips and the rest were crumbs. (Seen in my photo) IF I  return, I'm only getting the wings or a burger.",

She said yes so I ordered a Big Wave. I didn't look at a menu nada, but she didn't tell me that big wave is no longer a premium and now they have \"crafted beers\".   Because of this I had to pay $18 a pitcher and that clearly added up and is 33% more than what I was I planning on paying.   It would have been one thing had I known, but to not inform me that there are now crafted beers vs. premium, especially when I asked if premium pitchers are still $12 is why I am leaving the 1 Star.   I asked her about it after I received my bill and explained but refused to do anything about it or even apologize.   I will still go to Zipps but since some of your staff is letting your patrons know of the changes, I figured I'd do it for you. If you didn't have amazing wings I could easily not come back.",

Cheesy green chili chicken rolls were good too lots of flavor,  but the philly steak rolls were just meh. Their fries are awesome... nice and crispy.  The black & bleu burger was ok nothing special... Service is always hit and miss.

As a result of her lack of attending to her customers she came-off as if she could care less if we were there or not.  Nice girl, probably just too much multi tasking to save on labor costs; Idk I went here early, 1140am, [today, May 2nd]   to beat the lunch rush.  I did.  Only 10 -12 tables occupied and 6 - 8 at the bar where I sat for speed of service.  I waited an almost unbearable and completely UNnecessary 25 - 33 minutes for about 10 wings, nothing more ---  to me that is ABSURD !!  I was ok with the lack of care but waiting so long for a few wings before the lunch rush is UNacceptable.  For this reason, I, WILL NOT RETURN to this location and will think twice about the others.  It's unfortunate because I work 90 seconds away in an office with 120 people.  Just so you know, it takes a lot for me to write a negative review, it's only the 2nd one in 6 - 8 years!!!!  I'll be spending my lunch money at the Native New Yorker in the future.",

Ordering their wings on medium is smart move, their wings are already so flavorful and sweet, that its a shame to go any hotter, since you'll mask the inherent, crisp, and juicy flavor. I'd say pass on the Fish Tacos, and if you're in a burger move, order the Jalapeno Burger. Sampled their beer, not bad!   Breakdown: Zipps Golden Wings ~ a MUST get! Fish Tacos ~ Yawn... Sweet Potato Chips ~ Could do again! Jalapeno Burger ~ Delish!   Overall, this is a chill spot with your better than average bar food!",

The Golden Wings are one these items, along with the Turkey Burger, Quesadilla's, Taco's, and some of the Focaccia's.  The Onion rings are also good and the fries are hit or miss.  Zipps will let you get half and half of Onion rings and fries for the menu items that have fries which is nice.  I hear the burgers are good there, but since I don't eat beef, I really can't say.  There are more than 20 TV's at this Zipps location, so catching a game there is not a problem.  The bar area is a good size and has 2 pool tables and a shuffleboard table.  The seats at the bar, however, are not comfortable at all.  There is also a good happy hour at Zipps.  There is a happy hour Monday through Friday from 3pm-7pm and then another happy hour from 8pm to close every night.  There's various foods and drinks for the 8pm to close happy hour depending on the day.  Overall, Zipps is a clean sports bar with decent food, lots of TV's, and a good bar area.",

We never received our order until 745 p.m. and I asked for the extra hot sauce to be on the side and that it be heated. We we received the wings, one hour after ordering, the sauce was cold, another hot sauce was not delivered to another guest, our 2 orders of half fries and rings, 1 was delivered and the 2nd order was wrong which took 20 minutes to get right. My extra hot sauce took 20 minutes to get delivered and the manager told us that they normally don't heat the sauce...WHAT?? This quick meal of 4 orders of wings and 2 baskets of half fries/rings took 2 hours. The manager agreed he would happy hour all our drinks, this never happened. We felt like form the restaurants point of view it was no big deal. Our bill was $100 as we kept ordering drinks waiting for our food. They did offer us $10 for our next visit...REALLY!! Sad to say after 10 years going to this establishment we will not be returning. Our last 3 visits have been bad, but this was the worst experience I have ever had. The last time I went I asked for the sauce to be heated and when it arrived, delived by a manager, it was cold, when asked it to be heated I was told they normally would but they were to busy, I guess they are not in the business of customer service...wait they are but don't practice it!! The servers are always nice, it seems to be a kitchen issue most of the time. I hate to say it but I will be telling everyone in our neighborhood about my recent experiences. I prefer to give my money to an establishment that cares about the customer and shows it!!",

The rest of the menu is solid--never been disappointed.  The service is fine and the wait staff quite friendly, especially the bartenders.   It's big place with plenty of seating, far better than the Scottsdale location.  Gets pretty crowded on Friday nights and NFL Sundays, though.    Special props to Justin, one of the managers.

BUUUT, Zipps earns their rating because they have THE best wings in the whole wide world!! ZIPPS GOLDEN WINGS are to die for!!  The perfect balance of crispy and juicy - and the \"Golden\" sauce, is liquid crack!!  I can't compare this Chandler location to any other Zipps locations because I've never been to any of their other locations.  I've been here a couple times during football season, Sunday night or Monday night games, usually packed. Lots of TVs, solid football watching venue.

The slices of pizza are decent for being so cheap, but the burgers...oh so good! I'm not even a big burger fan, but something about ZIPPS burgers is unexplainable. I do crave them all the time. Just get the Zipps burger with cheese and half fries and half onion rings. YUM. Lately the fries are pretty soggy. They taste great, but they need to be much more crispy.

A pacific cod is about 3 feet long and the fillets (except at Zipps) are flaky and delicious.  Anyway, whatever species the fish started out as was cooked badly and tasted worse.   The french fries with the fish were tasteless, which I guess is a step up from the fish.    We will not be back.",

    "text": "So...I don't even know how to start.  Giving this 3 stars (vs lower) only cause I like the chain and the food was good.  My husband's beer got there first and something was off (I tried it and agreed) so we sent it back.  They then brought my daughters Gingerale, my sons Mr Pibb and my gin and tonic.  The Gingerale tasted like pure soda water and my gin and tonic tasted like soda water and gin. So we called over the waitress and asked for them to check.  They then brought my husbands other beer order and the manager came over and asked about the beer and my husband said it's flat (and it was, I tasted it too) and the manager said well I checked everything and it all checks out, but ww will take your other one off the bill, my husband being embarrassed said I'll drink this one, which he never did it was that awful.  So then they delivered my kids food and mine and we asked about my daughters and my drinks.  The waitress said she'd check, when she came back she said they didn't think anything was wrong... so I ordered a greyhound and my daughter said I'll stick with water.  And, my husband then asked where is my salad?  They came back with his salad and we ate our meal.  At the end of the meal I got my drink which at this point I just guzzled cause I had the hot chicken skewers...net/net one of worst experiences of service and drinks.  So sad, it's very difficult to disappoint me and I'm leaving out details and also the gaps of time in between each scenario, just sad.",

This location has a big screen TV right over a walking path, (by the ATM) which I saw numerous customers bump their heads on the bottom of the TV. Bad location.  Tonight, the restaurant was freezing cold. We asked to eat outside on the patio (where it was quiet and warm) but they said there was a private party there that reserved it.  I ordered two appetizers, the 12-chicken skewers with a side of the mild wing sauce to dip them in, and the mozzarella sticks (which arrive in spring rolls, exactly as described on the menu.).  They serve Coke products (Yay!)  I also ordered the fish and chips. The fries are amazing! The fish, not so much. It tasted fresh, but was cut way too thin and was very dry as a result. Its made with cod, but the cod is just 1/4\" thick. What a shame. If that cod was 3/4\"-1\" thick (or thicker) it would have been amazing.  Everything tasted fresh - as if nothing is frozen and everything is made on-site. That's a good thing, but our waitress never offered me a refill on my drink, allowing it to run dry during my meal. The fish was too dry and the chicken was flavorless. Again, everything was very fresh, but flavorless.  Maybe I'll go back and try the pizza, maybe I won't go back at all unless they start offering  ear plugs and a jacket on the menu.",

I had only been here once before I moved into the apartments next door and that first experience was less-than-stellar. They had just opened this location and clearly the cook had just flunked jr high Home Ec class. After moving nearer, I figured it deserved another try, if only to enjoy a beer within walking distance.  I have been pleasantly surprised. My favorite part is that they have pretty good wings in addition to the cheap beer at all times but \"Unhappy Hour\". I am not sure if I should be ashamed or proud that every staff member here knows my name and/or my exact order.   I come here often to shoot pool and have met quite a few other regulars. We all have a pretty good time. It's laid back and affordable AND I can walk (sometimes stumble) home.",

The food was great and both waitresses that served us that evening were fantastic during the service. The reason this review is lacking two stars is because the end got a little weird. The waitress brought us our bill (for only the 3 drinks we had after dinner because dinner was already paid for) I put my card in the little leather booklet and she quickly picked it up. When she brought the bill back she set it on the table and started walking away. At that point my boyfriend noticed my card had been charged $56. He quickly called out to her and she came back and he calmly asked her why the card was charged for $56 when my bill was only $14. She responded by saying that it would void off. He said that is fine but he would like a receipt for proof that it was going to be voided. She proceeded to get upset that he was inquiring about a solution to the mistake that had been made. All of a sudden she started bawling and yelling about how she's worked 60 hours this week and in a snarky tone asked if he wanted to talk to her manager. He was baffled because he hadn't even been rude or upset about the mistake. He just wanted to make sure for my sake that the mistake was fixed. She snatched up the bill and ran off still crying and we could see her talking to another employee at the computers. She started walking back over (still crying) she said something like \"that wasn't your fault\", tossed down the bill and walked away with no other explanation. We looked at the bill and it had been adjusted to the correct amount although there was still no receipt showing that the $56 had been voided. I signed the check and we looked around thinking maybe a manager was going to come and talk to us about the incident or that the waitress would come back with an explination but after sitting there for about 10 minutes unnoticed we got up and walked away. The only part of this that I am upset about is that there was no explanation or apology for the mistake that was made with my card or the outburst of emotion from the upset waitress. I understand that people have bad days and if she has worked 60 hours this week then I know her pain. The fact that she got upset just shows that she is human but the fact that there was no explanation for the mistake of my card being charged $56 or an apology for the outburst of the employee shows me that this establishment is not concerned with good quality customer service which is something I am disappointed to say because during dinner I told my boyfriend we had to stop here more often because I loved their patio seating. :(",

The manager came over after we sent them back, Cookie was very understanding, and he wasn't as understanding.  He offered to re-make them, but said it would take 15min or so.  We were hungry then so said we would just take them to go and ordered a side cease salad because it would be quick.  The manager took the side caesar off the bill, but did not apologize about the wings or seem to care that much.

    "text": "Just had TERRIBLE service here. I wanted to go to Zipp's for my birthday and got there at around 7:00pm. It was a Friday, so my friends and I knew we would have a bit of a wait. Waited 30 minutes to be seated which was fine and understandable. Then, we ended up waiting another 30 minutes with not a single person come by to ask us for our order. I ended up having to get up and ask the hostess for someone to come by our table. The shift manager came and just offhand apologized for the wait and only took our orders because I let him know we were ready (He initially only wanted to take our drinks which we hadn't received yet). He didn't write our order down which ended up being a problem later. We wait another 15 minutes for drinks to come by from another server/busboy (by this point we haven't actually met our server). THEN, our actual server comes by asking to confirm that we wanted fries with our foccacias (no introduction, no apologies for the poor service, etc. just a quick \"you wanted fries, right?\" and then leaving) Fast forward to when we finally get our food, and our server hands my two friends their food and looks confusedly at me and says, \"Wait, are we missing something?\" To be clear, all i have in front of me is my drink. None of us have silverware; my friends have their full meals in front of them; and I haven't gotten anything. There are only THREE people at this table. So I say, \"Yeah, I ordered the buffalo foccacia.\" And she says \"Okay, I'm going to check on that for you.\" We end up waiting 20 minutes with no one coming by to check on us, no notification that the order got lost until our server comes back and very shortly says \"That buffalo foccacia will be out\" and leaving. No offer of service recovery, a 'sorry', or any indication that anyone on this staff cared. So, we wait another 15 minutes before we decide we're just going to leave. My friends didn't eat their food because they were waiting for me to have my food since it was my birthday. Lo and behold, when we are leaving, our server finally comes by with my buffalo foccacia (I have waited more than hour at my table for this food) and says \"Ladies, you're going to have to pay for that!\". For what? The non-existent food I haven't been able to eat and the piss poor service that only seemed to care once its money was walking through the door? We tell her we want to talk to the manager. She then takes our food off the table and throws if out to go get her manager. She COMES BACK, GIVES US OUR TAB (like we were paying for that after she threw out our food lol), and THEN goes to get the manager. The shift manager who took our order comes after a while and the first thing he says is \"So, what's going on here, ladies? Did something go wrong? Do we not want to pay?\" and we're standing there dumbfounded. Hell yeah, \"something\" went wrong! In the end, after attempting to detail every single thing that went wrong with this visit, the shift manager decided to confront his employee (our server) literally right next to us. That is ridiculous and so unprofessional. I mean, seriously, are you TRYING to start a confrontation? In the end, all we got were free Diet Cokes and 10 bucks of \"Zipp Bucks\" i can only spend at that location - which we'll never be going back to. Thanks for nothing!",

Also order a hurricane which was horribly made with too much almond oil. Place seems to only cater to beer & knows very little else.",

After waiting for about ten minutes a four top came in behind us and got sat right away because they were bigger. Mind you a game was on so no tables were leaving soon. What a way to treat your loyal customers.",

    "text": "Nice to find it open one labor day and glad the servers not complaining about working it. Never heard of the place B4 but my son suggested it along with hockey puck burger place, the Native. I said let's try <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FZipps.as&s=3492bf9c23c811d62909aa4ef19113d25a021e16d5a2a0dd02b6f599ee200a8c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zipps.as</a> it is new to us. The place was slow for lunch but families were coming in with the small kids, us too.  We ordered and it didn't seem too long a wait for the food to come. I will only comment on my meals and what I snagged form others. I had the Bacon and cheese burger which was just great. Double patties of fresh meat, Juicy and nothing like a fast food patty. My fries were from fresh potatoes not frozen which were just fantastic. I snagged an onion ring from my wife's plate and it was good, lightl and crisp but it was cool to the touch which was a turn off. In front of me was a tub of sweet potato chips which were great and i possibly could have eaten the whole thing but was allowed only 1. Hey, It was someone else plate and lucky to get the one. Our only other go to place in that part of town is Teakwoods and now it now has  competition  Oh, I don't drink beer that much and was shocked to see glasses the size of pitchers being served.and it made me think of a German beer hall.",

    "text": "This place has a sit yourself sign in the front. Sat down for about 15 mins, then a guy(seemed like a busboy) comes over to ask what we would like to drink.   After few mins, the guy comes back with drinks and asked if we were ready to order.  Everything seems normal...EXCEPT we had never got our menus. hahaha...   Then we got another server Brianna I believe. She was very sweet and helpful!  Food came out perfectly as we ordered.   Except for the sit yourself no menu issue, I had good food and great service!",

And the happy hour CANNOT be beat! $6 for 10 wings is a bargain!! And the zipparitas make my heart sing with joy. We love the fries and the onion rings, and loveee the option of changing it up with half and half orders! Yea baby.  An ode to Zipps: O, Zipps, thy food and service are great A good place for friends or a date Of your quality there is nothing to hate The best sports bar in all the state!",

    "text": "Nice place to drink some beer and enjoy extremely hot wings. Seriously, their very hot wings don't lie. Also one of my favorite bars to head over to and play shuffleboard at. The one down side to the shuffleboard table is that it's very close to the high top tables in the bar. If someone is sitting at the high tops you will need to walk around the front of them to get to the other side of the table. Don't let that turn you away however, this place is awesome.",

We had a big party go into lunch today and although Zipps doesn't take reservations we still called ahead anyway. We know that we can be a handful with the kids running back and forth and part of our party in the bar but our server Kathy was awesome! She did an awesome job chasing us around both parts of the restaurant. The kids were occupied in the kids zone and the adults were all having a good time. The food is always good as well. My husband and I got the Monaco foccacia with the delicious onion rings and an order of golden medium wings. Which are to die for. Plus the weekend HH with big beers and tasty zipparitas on special made it even better. This is a great place to meet up with friends and family. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "$3 Margaritas?  $5 fish and chips?  Sign me up!  Those were the Friday late night specials.  I tried some of the margarita.  It was served blended like a slushie in a small glass, but they packed a lot of liquor in that glass!  We started with the golden wings which were a nice mix of sweet and sour.  The fish and chips were very good, and I opted to have them with sweet potato chips, which were freshly made and delicious.    Minus one star for the very sluggish service.",
