But when I tried them, I realized they were just as good or better than with the liquid tomato. But the star was the sandwich.  The bread was just right and the salmon was excellent. Tomato and lettuce were fresh. And Travis was a very customer-friendly bartender. Guess where I'm going next time I am in Sky Harbor?  That's right!  Hopefully I'll be able to squeeze into a seat at the bar again, though.  This place gets PACKED!",

Not sure what you were doing on your phone all that time (it looked like work), or spending time at the pass bs'ing with the kitchen staff, or taking pictures of other servers, but while your head was down doing all that, your restaurant was falling apart.  Your staff or your customers shouldn't have to tell when things are bad, it's your job to know.  You were physically in the restaurant and I saw you look up maybe a handful of times to the floor.  Unacceptable!  Especially when you know you're short handed!  You value proposition as an airport brewery/restaurant is to serve beer or food and do it quickly!

First of the host said we can second how she said it was very rude and condescending. Lack of communication and customer service training.  She insisted that we cannot sit on that table because they get busy! Even though there are other big party tables that are available. You get busy or not and if u only have that table available does that mean you will refuse a paying customers' business because u only sit party of 3 and above in there? Until someone said it was ok to sit there. We sat for a minute and realized this place doesn't deserve my business so we decided to leave.

It was 8am, I don't want an alcoholic beverage or soda/juice. We order our food and we wait. While we wait I notice that the waiter is MUCH kinder and attentive to the older couples near us. Is he ageist towards younger people? Who knows. Some other waitress drops off our food and quickly leaves without us getting a chance to tell her that we were missing part of our order. Our food was cold. So cold that the inside of my potatoes were cold. The cheese on my eggs started to harden. Our waiter is nowhere to be found. Eventually, he shows up and realized were missing part of our order, apologies and walks away. I assumed he went to go check on it but I guess he never did. 10 minutes later I flag him down and just tell him to cancel it.

Waited at ta me for over 10 minutes without anyone coming by to even offer water. It was 8am. Not really busy. Finally a waitress came over after many others just milling around. That's when we were told 3 of the breakfast items were not available. That leaves 3 choices. Oatmeal fruit and regular eggs and toast breakfast. We were told the the hostess should have told us. The didn't. Food okay for airport food. Probably should have just gone to Matt's Big Breakfast instead.",

Order a beer on tap because you are at the brewing company that makes the beer.  I personally enjoyed the Peach beer since it was actually loaded with peach flavor, but no overly sweet.  We had to kill over an hour, so we ordered fish and chips to share.  The food did take about 45 minutes to come out.  We ordered about 10:15 (so not the busiest time of day by any means).  The fried were better than expected since they also seemed to be beer battered and crispy.  The fish serving is about 5 pieces.",

I was able to overlook some of the shortcomings as I got pretty good service and loved the beers. I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was quite good. If you calculate that this is in an airport and I got a chance to sample beers I loved that no doubt colored my opinion. I had no problems with my burger and in fact liked it a lot even compared to grill places I've been to lately. I even thought about making sure I get the redeye out of this terminal again so I could come back.",

But surprisingly, the Four Peaks at Sky Harbor was fantastic!  The service was exceptional, attentive and really felt like an 4-star restaurant tugged away in a large over-crowded airport.  I had ordered the chicken-beer-bread sandwich (Minus the chicken) - it was great that they allowed the customization.  This tasted just as well as ordering from the Tempe location.    I applaud the service and food quality at this airport location.  Next time you are near gate A - do try out Four Peaks at Sky Harbor.  Definitely an experience worth being part of; thanks guys for an amazing lunch experience.",

My advice to Four Peaks HR team would be to better screen your staff in uniform services, i.e. wait staff before putting them on the floor solo. I know there are rotten eggs from time to time in life, but this was such a bad experience, that  I won't waste more time or money (airport food is usually priced higher than the same food at a food court) at this place.  Try Matt's Big Breakfast. At least they smile when taking your order.  I will say this, my service improved after I whipped out yelp and started my review. :(",

The doughy concoction that is beer bread almost reminds me of a tortilla, but it's so soft and melts in your mouth that the other ingredients are just a bonus. Having chosen the grilled chicken, the flavors meshed well. Anything with artichokes is a winner in my book. The service was bland at best. They were friendly but standard, I would have appreciated a little more follow-up while I was there. In their defense though, this is, after all, at an airport, which makes for a super busy day and in that regard, the servers did a decent job.",

Between the 5 of us eating, 3 of us had meals that included a burger or a chicken sandwich. 3 out of 3 burnt buns. My \"medium\" burger was cooked way beyond well done. I sent the burger back. About 5 minutes later, the server returned with a properly cooked burger with a bun that had not been toasted with a flamethrower. Unfortunately, the bacon was (quite literally) ice cold. I saw what happened. The server was given a cheeseburger, and pulled bacon out of the fridge, putting it on the burger.  My burger was just ok. The other guy's burger was well done when he ordered medium. Neither was well seasoned, just beef and cheese. Fries were decent though. Nice enough server. He took off the bacon since I didn't eat it. This would have been 3 stars if they'd have taken my burger off the bill.",

    "text": "Hey, this is a restaurant in an airport, so are you really expecting fine dining?  Four Peaks is the kind of place you may pick in order to avoid the fast food options in the terminal (although it's certainly debatable if Four Peaks' options, aside from the salads, are any healthier). The food is good but not outstanding--the chicken enchiladas were tasty and cheesy, but you won't compare these in a positive way to the more authentic Mexican meals you've had.    Service was good, but my biggest disappointment is that the place is in need of some upkeep. The upholstery in every booth was torn, giving the place a trashy look, and the seats were not very comfortable.  If you're going to try to offer a more comfortable and welcoming place for tired travelers, then it's important to make the spot more comfortable and welcoming. I'm not sure Four Peaks hits the mark for that reason.   Decent food and good beer, but overall, I found Four Peaks only okay. There's room for improvement here.",

It was supposed to take about 15 minutes, but ended up taking a little longer.   I saw other people ordering after me, getting their food first. I guess because they ordered salad, or mentioned that they were trying to catch a flight, that they got their stuff first?? I did ask for my food once I saw that happening. The guy that took my order did apologize for the delay though.  I finally got my food and thought that the chicken strips would be bigger, since the guy told that they were bigger and better than the wings I originally wanted to get. They used chicken breast and I was surprised that they were pretty juicy inside 8th street ale batter! I liked dipping them in the chipotle ranch sauce. The fries were cut in thick strips and really crunchy! They were extremely tasty and so enjoyable. I guess that's why they're famous here!",

Never had to wait for water to be filled up.  Food:   8th street chicken strips( $10.99) good portion.  Flavor is what you'd expect at an airport, have to appeal to literally the entire world.  White meat, muscle meat and tender so that was unexpected.  Martini, weights and measure laws in that town, 4 oz for $12 a fair deal.  Cons:  it's an airport, what do you expect.",

The counter shouldn't be labeled as \"Express\" and your cashier shouldn't set an unrealistic expectation of 10-12 mins...you're at an airport, people have schedules to keep.   In addition to the terrible service, the chicken beer bread was essentially a chicken pita wrap with soggy fries on the side. I can't comprehend what took so long to make such a garbage meal.   Bottom line, don't waste your time or money at Four Peaks.  Update: After being promised a refund for the $30 spent and time wasted, I have not received my refund after 4 days. There is no phone number listed online, the airport was never given one, and Four Peaks tells me they use their brand name but are not owned or managed by Four Peaks Brewery.

Bartender who took five minutes to bring a menu, ten to take the order, and another five to take the drink order.  Walked away after asking for the order then didn't return for ten.  It wasn't even busy.  Stalked away after bringing tap water instead of bottled.  No smiles offered no extra words at all. My connection was missed so I thought I was just coloring this experience with that palette. I left a small tip giving the benefit of the doubt. Not it. A big insincere gee whiz style \"thanks\" with a subtext of no thanks confirms intentionally poor service.  I wouldn't have chosen it if I did not get a food voucher and it wasn't close to the gate.  I wouldn't again unless I was trapped in Skyharbor and needed to get drunk.",

Can't really judge the quality of the food, as it was old and cold.  Oatmeal stout was so-so.",

The place was packed but luckily I got one of the last seats at one of the high top tables.  After being seated I was greeted and ordered a drink, vodka and cranberry, and for $3.00 more I could make it a double. Why not? While I was waiting on my drink I checked out the menu. I was torn between the Club and Quesadillas. After asking my waitress she recommended the Quesadillas. Perfect choice. They were packed full of cheese and chicken accompanied with sour cream and salsa...and I will just say I wish I knew where they got their salsa, one of the best I have ever had! Service was on point and a great spot to hit during a layover in he Phoenix airport.",

Now I paid an extra $2 for the fries on top of the $12.50 I paid for the sandwich. What came out was the tiniest French dip I have ever seen and a handful of fries. What you cannot tell from the picture is just how small the sandwich was; it was maybe a 6 incher. Needless to say I will skip this place the next time and search for something else.",

It used to be an Oasis tucked away in the far corner of A Gates, and has always been worth it to me to walk down from other gates. In this case, when I arrived I was pleased to see it wasn't as busy as restaurants at the other Gates.  Which is why I don't understand the lack of caring customer service and good timings by my server.  Additionally, my Brewers Breakfast was sub-standard...initially the wrong order came out for me...the scrambled eggs weren't fresh and even appeared to be powdered eggs (yikes), the potatoes seemed like the Chef threw intmy plate whatever was left and the fruit was old.  My Server spoke too fast, seemed to hurry me, and the Hosts handling the seating were rushing everyone as well.  I'm sorry to say, I will no longer make the walk to Four Peaks...they let me down.  ***Headed to a vacation in Hawaii today (6/30/19) with my wife and against my better judgement, went back here today (only because Chelsea's was not yet open). Nothing has changed EXCEPT I had a pleasant server, however the eggs/breakfast they served was a joke. No idea what kind of scrambled eggs they served and everything was cold. Great fresh beer though.***",

Once we finally ordered our food, I watched how rude an Asian waitress treated a patron.  The lady moved from one table so she could charge her phone.    She told the waitress that she could not find where the outlet was, and the waitress gave her an attitude and pointed at the bottom of the table (while standing about 5 feet away).  Again, the lady stated that she did not see where it was, and the waitress commented a sarcastic remark to the effect of... it's the black thing where you plug your phone, and laughed.    Poor lady still could not find it, so she moved to the bar where the outlets were more visible and accessible.  It's not like the waitress was interrupted from doing anything more important because she stood there putting on lipgloss, standing over a coffee pot, chatting with two other servers moments later.  Our food arrived lukewarm, and was not good at all.  The country potatoes appeared to be deep fried more than once.  They were hollow, soaked with grease, and tiny.  The eggs appeared to have that microwave texture.  The fruit did not look fresh, and was soft.  The toast wasn't hot either.  Had we not been pressed for time due to a flight to catch, we would have complained to a manager.",

Honestly, I should have checked yelp but didn't think I would need to because we were only getting drinks.  It seems like they have a reputation for being slow and not friendly, and our experience wasn't any different.  I'm writing this from the Pei Wei next door because it was that unsatisfactory.   Service: A young man greeted us and we asked for a place for the 2 of us.  He didn't ask if we wanted a communal table, but sat us in the midst of a large group. My wife walked over to ask if we could sit at the 2 person booth he was wiping down. He told her he promised it to another group, which was odd because nobody else was waiting. Fine. Then she went up and asked again to be sat at a booth. He said he could put us on the list, it would be about 30 mins. It seemed like he would do whatever not to move us. 15 mins later and no waiter... we walked out.   Enough choices in the terminal (with alcohol) to not have to stop here. Listen to the reviews!

Talked to a hostess who asked if we would like to see a menu and wasn't told that about any ordering restrictions because it was morning.  We sat down and the waitress asked what we wanted. I stated that I would like a cheeseburger. Even before I got the whole word out, she mumbles in an annoyed voice, \"only the left side of the menu\". I looked at the menu again and saw wings on the left side of the menu. I said, \"oh cool I can get wings\". She was looking at the ceiling and said, \"if it's on the left side of the menu\". I wanted to talk trash to her real bad after that but decided to trash her and the company on Yelp and Twitter instead.   I ended up ordering the wings. The food did come out in a reasonable amount of time. The flats were ok but the drums were real fatty and all of them were undercooked. Nothing impressive going on at this restaurant chain.   The wait staff was the real problem though. I'm really sorry you are a waiter in an airport. It's totally my fault. Also I understand that you guys don't need to give a shit about most customers because half of them are probably never coming back because they live out of state. Bummer that I live here and will refuse to go to any of the Four Peak restaurants if a friend suggests it.",

I noticed a few of the food offerings, they all sounded good, and they were priced reasonably.   My only complaint was that I was in the C gates and this place is in A...that may mean nothing to you but trust me it's a flippin' far walk. Sure, it was worth it for the beer, mostly. However, it's possible I almost missed my flight, ok yes, I almost missed my flight cause I underestimated the far walk back to my gate. Again, I needed beer, it was worth walking past all the glaring faces to the back on the plane.",

This place, although it fits in the same category I just described of being overpriced, actually has overall good food, at least when it comes to breakfast. I got the chicken enchilada and egg breakfast, and my husband got the brewer's breakfast. The chicken enchiladas, green sauce, and beans all had a nice zesty flavor. The potatoes were disappointing, however, because they were clearly frozen out of a bag rather than fresh cut. My husband was mostly happy with his breakfast. He also didn't care for the frozen potatoes, and he didn't like that his breakfast only came with one piece of toast. Bread is cheap; there's no reason for it. He ordered one additional piece of toast, which came with a hefty price tag of two dollars and change! We got coffee to drink, and it was $7 for two small cups of very weak coffee. The waItress barely checked on us, so we were lucky to even get a refill. I don't know what their lunch foods taste like or their alcohol, but based on how delicious and memorable my own personal breakfast tasted, I will still give this place four stars.",

The chicken rolls were served with a creamy Jalapeno sauce. The portions for the appetizers were both filling and reasonably priced. The chicken rolls were $14.00 and the Fries were $6.00. The inside of the chicken rolls were almost like a chicken salad but with Anaheim Chili pepper instead of Celery. Our server was very tentative and kept checking on us to see if we needed anything. I been told they only have this Restaurant located in Arizona, I wish they had more places like this back home but it's definitely going to be part of my routine when we're back!",

Layovers were now filled with good food and beer....well...kind of. I wish they had a full menu - the real restaurants have KILLER daily food specials. I've now been to the airport location 3 times and each time I have been rather disappointed. The soft beer read overflowing with gooey cheese at the freestanding restaurant/brewery can be found crusty and seemingly overcooked. Why? :( I thought it was a fluke until I ordered it three times.  No pasta salad (four peaks literally has the best pasta salad on the planet. Think creamy, ranchy pasta with big chunks of artichokes and cheese...so good). No pizza either (go to the non-airport locations and order the pesto pizza-it's amazing). So alas, we are left with beer bread and burgers. Yeah, they're good but please stop over cooking my beer bread. And for the love of all things good please please start serving pasta salad!!!  Side note - this place still gets two stars because the beer remains consistent (but how could it not). Try the peach ale or hefeweizen. When in doubt, go with oatmeal stout :)",

    "text": "As a local and a frequent traveler, I am really excited about the transformation happening in Sky Harbor terminal four. Local restaurants like Matt's Big Breakfast, Chelsea's Kitchen, Delux and others are replacing Burger King and your typical airport fare.  I don' think Four Peaks has gotten the memo that airport food can be good.  On my way to my gate this morning I decided to give Four Peaks a try. I ordered a coffee (a bit lukewarm- but ok) and the Brewers Breakfast. I am not sure if I read the menu incorrectly but it said \"eggs\". I ordered eggs over easy and was given what tasted like powdered scrambled eggs.    If the only option was scrambled - the waitress should have said that when I ordered them fried.  So I have had powered eggs before and I can handle it. But the breakfast potatoes were really bad. The best way to describe them was waterlogged. I rarely don't finish my plate, even at the most mediocre restaurant - but one bite was enough.  Even the toast was pretty lame.  How can you make toast lame?  Not a great way to start the morning. Should have just had a coffee at Pete's or Starbucks.  I am sure the beer is good - but they need to give the food some serious attention.",

The food was identical to what you get for a continental breakfast in a hotel, except at a hotel it's warm. My food was all cold and mushy. Even the toast was mushy. How do you mess up toast??? How hard is it to freshly toast bread before bringing it to me?  This restaurant should either take their breakfast offering up a notch or stop serving breakfast. Their current offering is only going to turn away new customers.",

Ignores new customers, waits on customers out of order, unhelpful and surly answering questions, treats everyone like they are inconveniencing her, doesn't look at customers when talking to them and gives short, dismissive response.   The hostess was also less than pleasant.  Final straw - half a slice of cheese on a cheese burger. Are kidding me? Burger was mediocre - lots of gristle. Fries tasted like cardboard.   Small bonus the other bartender seems to know what he's doing. Pouring two beers at once. Hustling. Smiling. Maybe I just sat on the wrong side of the bar.   I fly through Phoenix every week. The food in the airport has declined over the past 4 years. I won't eat here again.",

In this terminal, Four Peaks is the only sit down place that isn't grab n go so it made our decision pretty easy! It was pretty crowded even at 10:30 am and the bar was completely full.  We were seated immediately and greeted by our server. We were disappointed to see that breakfast was only served until 10 am which seemed a little early.. but we were starving and didn't mind too much. I ordered the beer battered chicken strips which were really tasty and came with some crispy fries and Cajun ranch sauce. My boyfriend got the Cajun burger which he enjoyed as well. For the burgers, it's a $2 charge to substitute fries for the chips but the fries are so good it's worth it!  Solid place to grab a bite in the airport. Would probably stop by again if we found ourselves in this terminal with not many other options around!",

This place has the tiniest TVs for a sports bar! We sat in a booth and could barely see the TV from our seats.   Also, since this is the only sports bar we found, it was super packed inside which means don't expect service to be fast. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're in a hurry, but if you have some time to kill it's not bad. The food was decent and very reasonably priced for an airport. Wings were about $12 an order and most burgers/sandwiches are in the $12-14 range",

She was nice enough but it took ages to just get a menu or be a acknowledged, even though the hostess said I could sit there. It was just an aggravating experience.   After sitting for over 10 minutes waiting, & waiting I had to turn around & look for someone to bring me a menu. Seems petty but traveling, in a skirt for a business meeting & sitting at a high top- yah- not convenient when half the airport walking by can see you squirming to turn around graciously while not flashing the airport walk way!   Yes I tried to get a normal seat or a seat at a bar which were all full. It was lunch- I get it was busy so tossing a star on for that.   The salad was mediocre at best. The cubed ham, I always find off putting. There's gotta be a better presentation. It was a substantial serving but the cucumbers seemed old, the dressing & lettuce were fine but the ham was not good. Needed to disguise the taste with the dressing.   I would have loved to have received my silverware before my meal so I could avoid the awkward turn around again, to flag the buser to get me flatware. Also it's the airport. People are in/out for flights. Is it too much to ask to request you bring the credit card machine when I ASK for my check? Why then go get the check & not bring the machine?   I worked in service & this was worse than average, this was major lack of thought- especially considering she was chatting away with the beer drinkers next to me. I don't plan to return unless all other options are packed again. Would rather get a \"to go\" salad.",

    "text": "Stopped in here during a brief layover while passing through town. With a very short window between flights we decided to give this place a try. You's think that a brewpub located in a rather busy airport would be a quick prospect. That would not be the case.  We placed our name on the wait list expecting a short wait, especially since it was a party of 2 and the host stated \"about 5 minutes\". Cool, I'm holding out hope here since I could see several empty tables scattered throughout the joint along with about 8 open seats at the front bar that looks out onto the airport isle-way. After standing there waiting for about 10 minutes while the host moved at a snails pace to seat one other group I asked if the front bar was open seating. He promptly told me \"NO\" in a rather harsh tone. So we went back to waiting while he continued to move at a snails pace, with no real sense of urgency at all. In my opinion, if you're located in a busy airport and you have a decent amount of open tables, I'd make it a priority to seat customers in those empty seats as quickly as you can. One, it increases revenue. Two, it helps open up that isle-way so the large crowd gathering in front of your establishment isn't blocking all traffic in the place. Just my opinion though, you do you. After growing a little more impatient my cohort asked him how much longer it would be since we had already waited about 15 minutes at this point after being told it would only be 5 minutes and watching his seat a total of 1 group thus far, while still staring at several open tables and the previously mentioned 8 open seats at that front bar. When my cohort pointed at those 8 empty seats the host stated in a rather condescending tone \"Sure man, you go ahead and sit there. You aren't next on the list, but whatever man. Go for it.\" We took the opportunity to take a seat before we simply ran out of time waiting on this guy to do his job. I looked at the list as I walked by, there was a single party of 1 in front of us. Now, I'm no restaurateur, but if I was I would have sat that party of 1 at one of those 8 empty seats and then sat us next to that party of 1 and got on with life. Instead this guy seemed more interested in making everyone's life more miserable, which seems counterproductive to a \"hospitality\" position. But again, you do you.  Once seated, our waitress was the highlight of the whole experience. She was very attentive, informative, understanding and fun. I ordered the Arizona Chicken Rolls while my cohort ordered a chicken quesadilla. My chicken rolls were less than exciting. I found the chicken filling to be rather dry and bland. It could really use something to give it some moisture. the menu stated it has cream cheese in it, but I could not find any indication of cream cheese in mine. The sweet jalapeno dressing was good, but they were so dry I felt like I needed more of it to help them along.  All in all, if I ever find myself here again I'll just head to one of the 3 other places right next door rather than stand in line forever. I see from other reviews the wait times are borderline insanity, and clearly it's not just me who feels this way. I'd knock this one down to 1-1/2 stars if I could, and even then the 1/2 star is for the waitress who again was the only highlight here. The rest was about a 1 star experience. Steer clear, especially if you have a time limit.",

    "text": "Hungry on a recent layover, I wanted some pub-a-grub. Four Peaks looked homey and inviting and was pretty busy, a good sign. Saddled up to an open seat and charged up my phone with a busted looking but working USB conneXion.   Ordered me a Hop Knot American IPA, big 20oz for $8.75. Filled to the brim and cold, this was a solid beer. Served by Kaitlin, a very solid (skills and physique, phew!) server who seemed a bit off that night but was still efficient like the T-X Terminator cyborg lady.  Got the \"Bleu Light\" burger medium. It was cooked perfectly, had a tasty grilled taste and the bacon was crisp and delicious. $12.69 for this burger is a good price, especially at an airport location. Their regular burger is $11.99 and it's $2.75 to add bacon, which doesn't make sense really given my choice's price. Fries were lukewarm but Kaitlin scared me up a fresh hot batch Terminator quick. Fries were okay, with some kind of science-y coating. Why can't places just let plain potatoes, some good oil and salt do the talking? Enough with the caked on science.  But man, that burger! I followed my tall 6.7% beer up with a tall Raj English IPA at 6.9% and it was even tastier and potent! $30 well spent! $40 with tax and tip.",

Slices of meat are WAAAY too thick and makes it incredibly hard to bite into without pulling out the entire piece of meat which is a bit dry.   Had a white wine and had a proper and some other bit floating in my drink.   Honestly the only thing I enjoyed was the charger to reboost my electronics and my bottle of Apple juice.",

Not worth it   Next, we went to the express line for two sandwiches (aka wraps). They told us 12-15 minutes. It actually took 40. We got to our gate 20 minutes prior to take off and they had shut the doors so we missed our flight. The worst part was the bald man that works there tried to tell me we'd be fine because they'd be boarding until my flight. He tried to educate me on how boarding works. The short girl actually tried arguing with me about the fact that they took over double the time. The manager was the only one to apologize but only refunded us once we came back to tell her we missed the flight and demanded a refund. Stay away at all costs.",

    "text": "finally got to phoenix after a 4 hour delay in Newark. Glad to have gotten off of the plane an not sit so we went to look for some food. The place was busy and the reviews looked good so we decided to try it out. Ordered the pretzel and quesadilla. The pretzel was extremely salted down with butter/oil. It was so slippery to even hold. Had to get napkins to soak up all of the fatty oils. The quesadilla was greasy as well. It was oily for some reason. Wasn't too happy. Lacked chicken. And a glass of wine was $9.00. Not worth the $30.00. Thought the day could get somewhat better.",

The Oatmeal Stout delivered. Ask for it medium. However, the real treat was the server April Guardiola. Her service was amazing. Her smile could put any traveler at ease. I spoke to April about her wonderful demeanor and enjoyed hearing her perspective on life. I will definitely look for April the next time I'm in PHX.",

Not enough room obviously for my belongings and myself.  I was rudely asked to move my things so that others could sit.  Again, I asked for a table b/c of my belongings.  She walked away from me.  The bartender rudely and loudly raises his voice and says he needs he chair NOW!!!!  You do realize this is an airport?  People have crap with them.  When they have a lot of crap, common sense should tell you the bar isn't the best place for them.  My bad for assuming they had common sense.  Bartender also never checked on the food, never asked if I needed anything else.   It comes time for his shift to end, and he asks for us to pay our tab so he can collect his tips.  He also tells us if we'd like anything else the next bartender can open another tab for us.  I've been a server for much of my life, and never were any of these things acceptable.  To comment on the food,,,,I had the turkey club.  There was no bacon on it like there was supposed to be.  The fries had a weird taste.  Old oil maybe, maybe they use one fryer to fry multiple things.   Horrible service and subpar food.  I won't be back.",

Flash forward to a few weeks ago, we had a 4 hour lay over in PHX coming back from Mexico. After a week of dox equis i was craving a good hoppy pale.   The beer was very pleasing, the appetizer was good, my wifes burger was good and i ordered the italian beef. I did not realize it had blue cheese in it so I did not eat much of it. I wasn't starving so I didn't say anything. The waitress noticed, asked and when I told her that I wasn't a big fan of the blue cheese (being honest) not really expecting anything to come of it (i should have read the menu better). I was pleasantly surprised when she offered to take it off the check. I was appreciative and made sure to tip her well for the unexpectedly good service (at the airport!).",

I was pretty excited when I saw Four Peaks and that they were open for breakfast!   I love Four Peaks and will always continue to support them by enjoying their amazing beer and tasty food for lunch/dinner, but one thing I can't say I loved was their breakfast at the airport. The environment was great and this would be a perfect spot during the lunch/dinner hours, but the breakfast menu was very limited and included a beer bread breakfast option, breakfast burrito and a basic egg meal (among a couple other items). I went with the basic egg meal which came with eggs, bacon and toast. It filled me up but I would have loved a little more flavor and flare! Luckily they had mimosas when we got there so I enjoyed one but learned they ran out of them during while we were dining. Unfortunately our waitress, Kemberly, was a little stressed when we dined in and was pretty unhappy (and expressed it to me) when I asked to borrow a pen when we first sat down. The pen never arrived and it wasn't until the check came that she finally asked if I still needed the pen. This was about 40 minutes later. By then I had figured out another solution to find a pen.  While our breakfast experience at the airport Four Peaks was not what I would have hoped for one of my favorite breweries in town, I will give it another chance in the future but not during breakfast-time. Hopefully we get a nicer server next time around!",

I ordered a /2 roast beef sandwich and cup of beef barley soup. Arrived quickly. Soup was cold and the sandwich had no mayo or horshradish. I asked waitress for a side of horseradish and she replied while walking away \"we don't have horseradish.\"  She put my bill out and I gave her card to pay. She maybe said 10 words to me the while time I was here.",

I don't think the people working here are smart enough to realize that this is an airport and people are here to fly somewhere not spend a leisurely morning sitting around.  I wish I could talk about how the food was but I can't, we waited 50 minutes for our food before we had to just walk out, because we had a plane to catch.  It's really sad and a poor reflection on a great chain.   There are lots of amazing places to eat at sky Harbor, this is not one of them.",

OK, that's not too horrible, but it is annoying, and unexpected. So, after ordering my food at the bar, and getting my drink, the bartender virtually ignored me and the other patrons at the bar while she chit chatted with her manager. Until my food arrived, I really didn't care. After my food arrive (which was not very good... I'll get to that in a moment) I still couldn't get her attention. Too busy yapping away with what looked like the manager, and the other bar tender... Needless to say I ended up getting what I needed myself (Ketchup from the other side of the bar). Now, the food... I ordered the french toast with bacon. I asked for the bacon to be crispy... it wasn't. The french toast was cold, and a couple of the pieces were stale and impossible to cut/chew... seriously, they were like rubber! The only good things were the orange juice (from a container), and the potatoes o'brian. Maybe instead of being a chatty Kathy the servers at Four Peaks could actually spend some time paying attention to their customers. I doubt I will ever go back to this particular dinning establishment... which is a shame, because I really like Four Peaks in Tempe.",

We visited at 8am on a weekday and were provided a table with enough space for our luggage. Service was very fast--always appreciated in an airport.  I ordered the fruit plate. Wow, was I impressed. It included black and red grapes, whole strawberries, pineapple, honeydew, cantaloupe and massive blackberries. It was $7! I would have almost paid for that a piddly container of fruit from a myriad of airport vendors. Everything was fresh. I ate my fill and shared some as well.  My husband had the French toast and enjoyed it greatly. It had a full stack of chewy bread accompanied by fruit and a paid addition of bacon. It even looked beautiful.   The restaurant filled as we sat there, but we were still checked on several times by our server and a manager, and had the check in good time. I wish more airport restaurants were this pleasant and efficient.",

I'm sold instantly.  Now, I didn't have high expectations for an airport restaurant, but now I feel bad for underestimating them! I ordered a few peach beers (very light and tasty), and a \"southwest\" burger. The burger had a great charbroiled flavor, and came topped with a big slab of soft, poblano pepper. I ordered the burger \"medium\", and I would say it came our just slightly more cooked than a medium, but still juicy.   Overall, I was really please with the flavor in everything I ate and drank, and the bill wasn't too steep (considering it is an airport location). If you're swinging though PHX any time soon, I would recommend Four Peaks to fellow craft beer and burger lovers.",

I told the hostess that the smell was making me nauseous and if I could sit on the round table up front.  She was tentatively considering it.  And a waitress jumped in and refused to let us be seated there.  We tried to plead with her that it was late most of The Resturant was empty and it would be okay.  For her it was better to lose a customer than let us sit up front.  There was no way I could have sat in the back without throwing up.  I ended up not being able to find any food to eat.  And had to board my flight to Boston hungry.   Shame on the staff for such callous treatment of a paying customer, despite knowing I was nauseous.  I hope management will retrain these employees about customer service.  Thanks and may God bless these two women.",

Grilled chicken in a wrap and served with fries or salad. Of course I got the fries as I really wanted fish and chips but tried to be good. That was a mistake. The chicken was processed, covered in melted cheese which I picked out as cooled and congealed...(better left on the plate than in my veins.) I tried to enjoy this meal as I picked out the good stuff. Because the wrap was cut up you couldn't pick it up and it was too \"wet\" to cut. Then I looked around at this decor and noticed the odd combo of a dance music soundtrack. Very odd...something not quite right here. If I had to come again I'd probably go with the fish & chips or a burger.",

They have some very good craft beer choices here, will need to swing by their other places the next time we're in the Phoenix area.   We ordered the 8th street pale ale chicken strips with fries, a great coating on the chicken and great chipotle ranch.  I ordered the French dip, another good sandwich, the fries were hot and tasty.  This place is reasonably priced for airport food, there's a fast food area by here with more expensive items that looked like half the quality.   It's a normal restaurant wait time for food, so make sure you have enough time to eat here, it's worth it.",

Twice I sent back the dish that looked disgustingly dirty and chipped.  Why would you serve a customer food in a dish that looked like it's been in through a Paris gutter.  See picture.  The Brusseel sprouts were good; however, the four piece of chicken tenders and fries was not worth the $13 bucks.  Neither was the 9 oz house merlot for $16 dollar each.  My lessons learned is that the price was not printed on the wine menu and I didn't ask.  It was drinkable but not worth $16 for that glass.  For the price I expected better wine.  Waitress was nice and service was good, however for her lack of detail for putting a second plate looking the same as the first,  I decline to give her too much praise.  I used to be a waitress and hold my responsibility to make sure everything was delivered at a high standard.    I gave up and just said to just put the last chicken tenders she brought out on a clean chipped less plate instead.  Having asked for a clean plate twice is really a disgrace how a restaurant is managed.  Your restaurant needs improvements and being busy at an airport is no excuse, the customer expectations remain the same and the value of the dollars we paid is also the same to us whether we are here at an airport or in New York City.",

I ordered a Kolsch, a crisp German style, in a massive 20 ounce glass.   And, the food is really good. The fried Brussels sprouts were terrific, on par with Michael Symon's. I love how the steak fries have a crispy exterior. The giant soft pretzel is served with a Dijon mustard blend. Nice. The chicken Caesar salad is too small for the price, and the chicken was okay, but the dressing is good.  Speaking of price, it seems like you get punished for not ordering beer. My wife got a 10 ounce wine that cost $23.50. My 20 ounce beer only cost $10.   I know this is airport food, but the price for the wine is criminal (and not listed on the menu, for good reason). The service was good, which is important at an airport. But, wow, do you pay for it. What I just described cost just shy of $100. Wow.",

We had been to a Four Peaks location before and loved it so we figured why not give the airport version a try.   I started my meal with the Smokey Bloody. Super tasty, unique smokey flavor but also very overpriced. I think the drink ended up being around $15, yikes. For food we shared the Pretzel app and the Garden Burger. The pretzel was really good and soft, but I wish it came with a cheese sauce as well as the mustard. The burger was good, no complaints there. The sauce was good and toppings were plentiful.   Overall a decent spot to grab some food. Expect to pay a bit more than usual since it's at the airport and make sure you give yourself enough time to order & eat. It's not the sever's fault if you think you can order, eat and pay in under an hour.",

It doesn't stop there, the waitress was unfriendly, argued with another server in front of me and she let me take my time to decide what I wanted only to later tell me that, they were only severing food from the first place. Then, the food came and it looked very appetizing but looks were deceiving, for it had no flavor at ALL. The service was not only slow but it was also very poor, on top of that, the food didn't even come close to making up for it.  So in conclusion, will I ever go there again, nope, NEVER.

    "text": "For an airport dining experience, this is pretty good.   It is a local Phoenix brewery /pub, so I expected it to be at least decent. It was really busy, which they handled about as well as they could. My server was attentive enough. I ordered the blackened salmon BLT. WOW. The salmon is seasoned and cooked just right.   For a steep up-charge, you can add avocado. Well, I think everything is better with avocado, so I did it.  The multi-grain bread, plus pepper jack cheese, plus pesto mayo made for some awesome flavors. I sacrificed my gut and had the beer battered fries --they were worth it. Of course, everything is over-priced in the airport, so this fit my expectations fine. Overall, a positive experience for lunch on a busy day of travel.",

I like that you have a choice of tasting about 5-7 small ounces of beer if its your first time here! Thats really nice & they have a great outdoor patio area where you can sit. I love going here in the fall/winter time.",

    "text": "Wow, this place is incredibly bad. Usually I give 2 stars if the service is decent but I simply can't. I ordered the \"blue burger\" and the \"Hop Knot\" IPA. So let's start off with the burger....patties are frozen, the blue cheese is something that would please a 3 year olds palette because it wasn't real blue cheese and was flavorless...but wait, not satisfied with your frozen burger, let's top it off with cold buns! Yes cold buns (probably straight from the fridge or freezer to keep their 'fresh' bread fresh).   The \"Hop Knot\" IPA is a literal Hop not. I was unimpressed to the fullest. So, after I paid my 13$ for a frozen burger and 9$ for my Non- IPA-IPA (I should of just ordered a hot milkshake or whatever bizarro world concoctions they have in the back) I left my tip and went on my way.   I know this review won't matter because as I left I saw a line of no less then ten waiting to try the best frozen patties in Arizona. .....conclusion: oh horrible airport restaurant (whose name I've luckily already forgotten) Thank you for representing your state, because who cares about pride or quality in Arizona right? Apparently anyone who returns to this disgrace of a restaurant surely doesn't know any better. Horrible. Bad. Sad.",

    "text": "Four Peaks at Sky Harbor is just as good as their Tempe and Scottsdale locations, and in my opinion, THE BEST way to pre-game a flight. Especially an international flight.  Although this airport location's menu is a subset of the ones in Scottsdale and Tempe, it's pretty damn close.  And it's got all the staple items you need to hop on the plane satisfied.  MORE than satisfied.  Every beer on their menu tastes great.  Grab the Kilt Lifter if you're clueless and unsure, the Hefeweizen if you're feelin' wheat-y, the Peach Ale if you're feelin' sweet, and the Oatmeal Stout if you're feelin' dark and filling.  But then again, you really can't go wrong with any of the beers!  Feel free to ask for a sample if you're not sure.  I can't comment on any of the breakfast items at Four Peaks, but food-wise, the Garlic Cheese Beer Bread is a dish made in heaven.  Perfect for a filling snack or to split with a friend as an appetizer. Warning: you may end up ordering two.  And really, \"beer-battered\" or \"beer- \" anything on their menu is worthy of high praise--it's a brewery first, after all.  If you're looking for a full meal, their burgers and the 8th Street Ale Chicken Strips come with my highest recommendation. At the end of the day, it's bar food made to perfection. Note: food must be eaten with a brew (or multiple brews) in hand for extra flavor and pleasure. :)  I'll save a more detailed review for their physical locations, but whether you're visiting Arizona, a Valley native, or a Sky Harbor wanderer on a long layover, stop here NOW.  Four Peaks is one of the best breweries in the USA for a reason, and don't let the Anheuser-Busch takeover deter you. Stop here, grab a brew, and enjoy where your travels may take you.",

Cleanliness - I thought the place smelled a little of ketchup and had some food on the floor. Sometimes airports have a little more of this but I have to admit it was not something I wanted to see/smell. Variety - There were a lot of solid options on the menu.  Accuracy - My order came out as expected. Temperature was good. Quality - I was alone in this place so I just have one meal to judge and mine was alright. It was not memorable but it got the job done.  Convenience - Naturally in the airport the entire point to these places is they are convenient to your location. So it's an easy layup but I do have to give them good marks. Layout - Tall wall booths, bar, short and tall tables in a basic square/rectangle. I sat in a high wall booth which I actually love as it gives a hint of privacy in an otherwise busy environment. Value - Airports are expensive and this was no exception. Anywhere else it would have been a better score but we typically pay too much for what we eat in airports. Other - I would suggest the place primarily for the layout. The cleanliness problem is likely time and place and not a chronic issue. The location and layout are good and the rest of the experience is solid.",

I motioned to the waitress that walked past me on 5 separate occasions. She went over to perhaps her manager, some bald guy in a grey colored shirt, and I could hear her say \"I get annoyed by people that try to motion me over.\" Well, I motioned over since I had a flight to catch and had limited time. It was so bad that a couple seated next to me also tried to motion to get me some help since they saw I was waiting awhile.  I should have just gotten up and left, but I didn't want to attempt to go to another place given I didn't have much time. So I finally ordered from a different waitress who came over. I ordered the spinach salad with salmon. The salmon was burnt on the outside, yet undercooked on the inside. Good times....  Needless to say, if I'm ever back at Sky Harbor, I'll go to a different terminal to eat.",

I got a cheeseburger with chips (although they brought fries instead) and a glass of Malbec.   While I ordered my burger medium, it was solidly well done and actually pretty charred on the edges. Never a big fan of overcooked meat but since they were getting ready to close, I just went with it. The fries were fine. I could taste that the Malbec was from a bottle that had been open for quite a while because it was pretty oxidized.   All in all, meh. Definitely not great, not terrible.

    "text": "The only decent sit-down breakfast option on this side of the terminal. Rating airport restaurants is tough for a few reasons. One, you're not at the airport to eat. Two, the food and the vibe just isn't as authentic as the original. Typically, Four Peaks gets FIVE stars from me.   I will almost always order the Brewers Breakfast. It's a diner style layout: your choice of eggs, bacon, home fries, toast. The overall taste isn't as fresh as I'd want but it's not as greasy as nearby alternatives. Before a flight, it's not safe to mess around with food that could unfavorably react with your body chemistry, so going with a simple spread has suited me well.   The wraparound bar is big enough to sit multiple people and there's some room to squeeze your bags on the floor between seats. I'm not a day drinker anymore, though the folks imbibing before noon seem to be having a good time.   If you're interested in a diner breakfast before your flight, this is one of the better selections in Terminal 4.",

The service was curt and the food was disgusting. If you follow this channel then you know I don't use those words often, but I was embarrassed for myself at the crumminess of this experience. I know these are airport employees, but Four Peaks should also be embarrassed by the mediocre food and service of their product. The two star represents the only thing I enjoyed while dinning here, and that was the beer.",

The hubby and I ordered chicken sandwiches (no bun) and fries about 15 minutes apart and they were both burned. I didn't think I wanted to eat so he got the first (burned) chicken sandwich. I decided I was hungry after all but I never dreamed they would serve a 2nd burned chicken...but they did. The guy next to me ordered the same chicken sandwich about 30 minutes later and his was fine so I don't know what was going on back in the kitchen when we ordered. The bartender was cool about it and took our meals off the bill, but I would really have preferred to have a good meal. The staff, the location, the other patrons were great - maybe we just caught the kitchen on a bad day/shift.",

The host stand was left unattended for 10 minutes, long enough for most of the folks in line to head next door for food options. Luckily, I had a significant layover, but most of that time was burned just waiting for things at Four Peaks.   Once I was finally seated, it took another 15 minutes for my waitress to stop by ask to take my drink order. I gave her my entire order (a quesadilla and bloody Mary), which took the bar 15 minutes to put together and the kitchen nearly an entire half an hour.  And thank goodness I paid extra for the 1/4 sliver of avocado on my quesadilla! That was probably what caused the hold up -- the kitchen had to figure out how to shave the slices so thin that I could just barely tell they were there.   Nothing about this experience makes it worth a repeat visit, so I'll likely skip this location next time I'm flying through town.",

Walking around the airport and talking to various restaurant/pub host to find out what's good at their place. Ended up deciding on chillin' at this establishment:  Four Peaks Brewing Company!  The place was so packed that I had to wait 5 minutes to be seated; at an airport of all places. Host sat me down closer to the windows view and a bit secluded from the rest of the pack there. There's a sit bar in the middle of the establishment with roughly 20 seats and approximately 15 inner tables seating 2-4 and another 15 booths along the outer rim of the restaurant.   Got my waiter to order a glass pint of their light IPA and an order of their French Dip Roast Beef with Fries. Ended up not eating everything on my plate but the food was marvelous--especially for a dine-in at the airport.   Recommend this place for fellow travelers!!",

    "text": "Had a layover in Phoenix and decided to grab a drink in the terminal, bar was full but finally found an open spot at the bar top here.  The lovely bartender politely greeted me and took my drink order and returned promptly. $20 for 2 doubles, SWEET! . Soon after multiple dirty glasses were continually dropped with in inches of me, several glasses at a time.  I thought... 'Well this is rude\". I let it go several times, scouted out the manager and guess what... Low and behold who could it be that now so rudely joins his rude and inappropriate staff by slamming a dirty pint glass in front of me? Yes the manager... Oh Game on... I politely approach him, confirmed he was in fact the manager and \"I would have thought you'd know better and have more respect to drop dirty empty glasses directly in front of a paying guest\".  His response \"well this is my service well, this is where I put them, where else could I put them\" my response... After pointing out other feasible options.. Oh it is? Well maybe you shouldn't have let me be served in your 'service well' without letting me know this minor detail.  I pointed out that it is in no way separated from the bar, no bar mats, no pitchers, just a plain old open bar top.  He said \"yes you shouldn't have been served here\". He walked away with his head down cowardly, taking no accountability, giving no apology.  I understand that this is a airport terminal and you don't get 'regulars' but this means MANAGEMENT/STAFF should strive to make the pitstop kinda experience more memorable and not be complete douchebags",

When we sat down the server went through a list of all the things they were out of... not a good start.  I ordered a veggie burger prepared in the jalapeno popper style with fries and beer, and the hubby ordered wings.  My burger came out cold... not luke warm... cold! It wasn't cold because it had sat too long, it was cold because they didn't heat it up enough. It was clearly a frozen veggie patty (FAIL) that they probably threw on the grill and attempted to heat up for about 2-3 minutes... neither the cheese or the cream cheese were melted at all.  That should have been their first clue.  My beer was okay, the glass wasn't chilled so it went luke warm quick.  Despite the initial fail on the burger, the server was prompt to check on us and get it corrected.  When my new order came out it was the proper temperature and pretty tasty.  Overall the experience was just okay... they need to work on the details.",

We went to stand at the row of counters to drink our coffee, and Tiffany made it very clear that we were not welcome, and reached over my 10 year old daughter, and slammed down something on the table.  She then proceeded to talk about us to other staff, and point and roll her eyes...we live in Gilbert and go to Four Peaks on a regular basis with a group of people, we will not be spending any more money there and you can thank the unprofessional brat who doesn't like the morning shift at the airport...Tiffany you are a joke, and you are in the wrong business..please go serve popcorn at the movies.",

    "text": "I went here a few weeks ago to celebrate my Fiance's friends promotion. It's obviously hot in AZ in July so it was slightly uncomfortable in Four Peaks Brewery since they use swamp coolers. That actually did not bother me very much because they had an ample amount of fans and the atmosphere of drinking a beer inside the brewery totally makes you get over it. The prices are very good in my opinion. The options they have were overwhelming, in a good way! I had such a hard time picking out an appetizer. I ended up ordering a pitcher of one of their fruity beers. I can't remember what it was called, but it was very good. I got the soft pretzel and it came with 2 dips. I guess one was supposed to be a jack cheddar cheese an the other was a dijon mustard. The pretzel was good, but the dipping sauces were terrible! The cheese sauce was so runny and didn't even taste good. I was surprised to hear that this was their \"new sauce\" for the pretzels. Bleh. The dijon mustard was alright. I am not a mustard fan at all, but I REALLY like the dijon mustard that Uncle Bear's has for their soft pretzels and I was hoping for something similar. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. I would go back to Four Peaks Brewing Company in a heart beat. Our server handled our large table very well. We had a great time!",

I've had some good german-style pretzels in my life, including those rolled by Amish girls in the downtown markets of Philadelphia. The pretzels at Four Peaks were phenomenal! Perfect crisp, buttery, browned outside, with a fluffy, bready inside. Salted just right. Went great with the light, refreshing Sunbru, with which I was equally pleased. The beer tasted so fresh and citrusy. And finally, the service was quick and kind. Will stop by Four Peaks every time I fly through the area.",

Our server went on break once we got a food so another server was left to gather our plates, refill our drinks and we ended up waiting for our server to come back with our check 20 mins later. I ordered the french dip and added on onions. The huge stack of onions was thrown on directly in the middle of the sandwich and not spread throughout so I had a bite of just onions and then none for the rest of my meal. As soon as my plate came the bottom slice of bread was completely soaked through so I had to turn my sandwich upside down just to keep it together. The au jus tasted and looked like warm brown water. I didn't add any flavor at all to the sandwich. My husband said his burger tasted like a frozen patty. Do yourselves a favor and unless you're looking to hang out for a while and drink beer, try one of the other options in this terminal.",

People who came in after me got wings but then, about 5 min later after they got theirs, I'm told they are out of wings, so I reluctantly ordered a quesadilla, because I figured it would be quick..wrong... all the while the drink is getting watered down and warm. The bill comes and they've charged me for don Julio instead of patron at $17 for a single pathetic pour.   when I point out that I got patron.. she returns with a bill for the same amount and says nothing as if I wouldn't notice...when I question she very surly tells me \"it's not a well drink!\"    Seriously?  So i can't at least have an  apology for the long wait, or serving my wings to other people... or the fact that I'm paying $30+ for the honor of being treated poorly by you? And drinking a like warm drink?  Bartender then tells me it's $14 but can do nothing and I need to talk to the manager... stood there waiting for manager until lost patience and decided my time was better spent letting others know.",

I ordered a bloody and he asked which vodka I wanted - nice touch. I went with a double shot of goose, and asked about their mix. He said that they make the mix in-house which is always a plus, but almost unheard of for an airport restaurant! It was super spicy and flavorful, definitely would order again.   I ordered the wings and they were fine. I like a crispier skin on my wings and these didn't have that which means either they sat for a while with the sauce on in the back (which I don't think was the case as food was coming out quick!) or they just weren't fried/baked very long. Either way I liked the vinegar-y buffalo sauce a lot. The fries that I was able to sample from a neighbor were fan-freakin-tastic, an awesome crunch to the batter on the outside.   I was camped out for a while waiting and drinking, and Travis overheard me whining to my brother on the phone that it was going to die before I landed, and naturally my charger was in my checked suitcase. Travis brought me over his personal cord to use for charging while I was at the bar - the service alone would bring me back the next time I find myself in AZ.",

I stopped into Four Peaks Brewing Company before heading home to Orange County to have a beer and watch the last 4 innings of the Halos game. Four Peaks is an Arizona craft brewer that offers Seasonals along with 8 mainstay recipes and I have always been fond of their bitter yet hoppy Hop Knot IPA. With that in mind I ordered a pint along with an order of their Brickhouse Wings with Classic Buffalo Sauce.   The wings were surprisingly delicious but also astonishingly spicy. In fact, as I ate the heat became a bit overwhelming at times causing me to step up my drinking game (perhaps that was the whole idea in the first place). The skins were a tad too moist for my liking but serviceable at the very least and the sauce had a zesty perfume I admired. The hoppiness of the aforementioned IPA cut through the heat like a sword.   At $25.00 for the wings and 2 beers the large snack (or light meal, you decide) is not exactly cheap but given the circumstances, I was perfectly satisfied with my experience at Four Peaks Brewing Company.",

I found a bar seat and ordered a pint of their signature beer (the Kilt Lifter scotch ale) and a cheeseburger with fries.  I really liked that they had such an expansive bar area as opposed to a bunch of tables. It made traveling solo much more comfortable. Plus there were USB ports underneath the bar so I was able to recharge my phone all the way to 100 percent before heading to my gate, which was awesome. No need to sit on the floor next to a plug!  My burger was tasty and cooked appropriately. The fries were so-so, but they did offer several sauces (like mustard and ketchup) to spruce them up. I enjoyed the beer, but it wasn't among my favorite scotch ales. In all, though, I paid roughly $20 with tip, which isn't all too bad for an airport meal -- or in general!  A nice way to break up the travel day.",

Great job! - My beer: I ordered the Raj IPA and it tasted great, it was cold and tasty and hit the spot.   - I ordered the turkey club with extra turkey and got the salad instead of Fries. the salad was disappointing, I wish I had the Fry's, it felt like it was ready made salad from a bag, and they added a couple of pieces of onions and 3-4 croutons. But the Sandwich was tasty, plenty of turkey and got the multi grain bread which was also tasty. Definitely will come back here next time I fly from terminal 4.",

I had the southwestern burger, which was cooked as specified to medium doneness (airport kitchens hardly ever get this right). The buns were nicely toasted. The lettuce+tom were fresh. The beef patty was nicely seasoned. As for the fries, they were perfectly salted and crispy. Well-executed, straightforward, and satisfying. What more can you ask for in between flights?",

    "text": "A little gem while waiting for my flight at Sky Harbor Airport.  The salad I got was decent size.  For airport food, it's actually pretty good.  The best part of the meal was their selection of beer.  They had a selection of six of their beer.  I was interested in the Peach Ale but did not want to order a sweet beer.  I ended up with a half and half: half Four Peaks Brewing Peach Ale and half of their Hefe.  It was only $5 (I think) and it was delicious.  They have an adapter and two USB outlets for you to charge your various devices while you wait for your flight.  I like this place and would definitely look for this place again when I find myself in transit at Sky Harbor Airport!",

    "text": "Is this spot seriously in an airport? Seriously? I still can't believe it...  In my humble and largely uniformed opinion, the Four Peaks location within the Phoenix airport is the epitome of airport dining. For one, how amazing is it to have a local business offering a much more appealing option over your typical overpriced chain dining options at the terminal? Secondly, this is not only a local business, it's a local brewery! Lastly, the prices are ridiculously reasonable!  The setup is no frills and right down to business. Bar in the center with numerous flat screen TVs (perfect for watching some NFL the day I was coming through) with tables and booths spread out around the perimeter of the restaurant. It seems that this place can get pretty packed (are you surprised?), so it may be difficult to get a larger party seated if you're hitting this spot at peak times (we had to split up our party of four).   Since Four Peaks is a brewery, let's talk about the suds, shall we? The bottom line is that these guys seem to know what they're doing as they are putting out some tasty, quality brews. While here, I had a pint each of the Hop Knot IPA and the Raj IPA (an English IPA). The Hop Knot was good, but a bit lighter and less full bodied than I typically like my IPAs. The Raj IPA, however, offered up that good hoppiness and bitterness. Yum. My buddy had the Hefeweizen and found it excellent as well.   Did I mention that the pints are only $4.50 here? Yes, you heard right...a very reasonable price for freshly brewed local craft beer with character as opposed to other airport dining establishments where you're paying up to $10 for a pint of Miller Lite. Thank you, Four Peaks!  Food wise, this spot again went above and beyond expectations. I opted for the grilled chicken beer bread, and I've been craving it ever since. Grilled chicken with artichokes, mushrooms, green peppers, red onions, and cheese all wrapped up in freshly baked beer bread. This dish was way above and beyond any airport food I've had in the past. Plus the sandwich was huge and came with a pile of delicious french fries...all for $10! Seriously, the prices here are so very much worth it!  Next time you've got a layover in Phoenix, do yourself a favor and check this spot out!",

Travis didn't seem to pay much attention, and after my food came, I waited for the condiments, which didn't come so ultimately I asked the patron next to me if they were finished with theirs, then Travis comes over and says \"I could have gotten you that\", but doesn't bring me utensils. The water glass sits empty. He doesn't even check to see if i want another Hop Knot. Pretty weak. I will continue to return for the beer, but the device could use some significant improvement!",

We sat in the very busy restaurant and ordered food and a beer, both the service from Christina and the food/beers were good. We then still had two hours to kill, so we went to the bar and asked the bartender if she could switch one of the TVs to the Australian open tennis tournament. She was unwilling to do so, although there were only a few people at the bar, and one of the many TVs literally had nothing showing on it at the time.",

Too bad, we will never get a chance to see if the smell of the food matches its taste.  We waited about 3-5 minutes for the hostess to appear and seat us. When she did seat us we were sat in a section that had a less than pleasant waitress that preferred to stare at us rather than wait on us.  Now please keep in mind it is 630am on a Sunday, and the restaurant is about 1/4 full.  After making eye contact with the waitress twice, and watching her stare at us for about 3-5 minutes, my wife and I left, and get this, no one stopped or said anything to us. Wouldn't recommend this especially if you're catching a connecting flight. But if you've got time on your hands you'll definitely be waiting for everything in this restaurant.",

We had a layover early in the morning for a few hours before our trip to Hawaii and we decided to come by for breakfast.  I had the enchiladas and eggs, and the wife had eggs and toast. The enchiladas was just insanely good. Such a good flavor! Everything went down quick. I also ended up getting a coffee. Even though it is a brewing company, I will say that their coffee is delicious. The eggs and toast were also really good, but how can you mess that up, right? ;)  Overall, this place was great. Food was priced good. Service wasn't too bad. I'd definitely come back again",

Our server was chatting up with all her friends/customers and it got pretty loud for a good while, which irritated my anxiety-prone husband. Food also took a while, and all was rather mediocre. Let me go into detail:  Buffalo Wings: These were decent, though the (what I assume was blue cheese) dip was very light and didn't do so much for the wings. For a girl who was mad craving some wings, this will suffice.  Salad: Honestly, it was so mediocre I don't even remember it. I just remember eating it all and being okay. Yup, just okay.   Everything here was really A-OK. I don't know what else to tell you. Even the beer selection is mediocre and for a \"brewing company,\" there really isn't much.

    "text": "I have been to this airport a few times over the past year and the same hostess is the reason for this review. Today, we approached the ToGo station and my bf was on the phone so I stepped aside to give him some time to finish. She finally came to the ToGo station but didn't say a word. She looked annoyed.. It was then that I recognized that she was the same one I've seen with that \"stank face\" the past few times. The unwelcoming energy is why we didn't dine there those times before bit today, we were starving and wanted to give the place a shot. After my bf finished his call we decided to dine in. As we approached the hostess counter, the same girl was there with the same annoyed look on her face and she seemed to have been bothered by whatever it was the blond haired gentleman, who was also working there, was saying to her in her ear. She rolled her eyes and chewed her gum carelessly. After excusing myself for the interrupting their dialogue, I asked her if it was ok if I can see a menu in reach she didn't even look at me to say yes or ok. This upset me. My bf told her that we will dine in and \"she asked bar or table\" and he said table and she just grabbed the menus very sluggishly and walked us to our table where she just put the menus on the table and walked away without a word. No thanking us for dining with them... no hospitality. Baylee, out server definitely changed our mood. She happily greeted us with a smile and her service felt genuine. She was the only server who I noticed wasnt chit chatting with the other staff and checking empty tables and pusing in chairs. She seemed to be the only one working with a smile. And if you see this Baylee, we thank you. In regards to the food, we ordered the Southwest Burger, southwest chicken rolls, and (I can't remember the name) these fries smothered with pork. I would recommend the pork fries. SO DELICIOUS and full of flavor. The meat juices complemented the fries perfectly. The Southwest Burger was also great and meat was cooked to perfection. I do not recommend the chicken rolls because it was dry and hard to take down. It was like trying to empty a can of tuna.. overall 1 star for ambiance,  1 star for speedy service, and 1 star for food taste.",

Beer battered fries are great and perfect with a nice cold beer (for my 21+ crowd of course)    Remember this is located in an airport terminal so don't have too high of an expectation. Especially if it's crazy crowded. Not the best place to go if you're in a rush.",

The service was marginally friendly and uncomfortably rushed. If you can, go somewhere else in the airport. If all you want is a beer- this is the place. Forget the food for sure. She took it off bill and I tipped her decently to covert what the meal and coffee would have cost. AND... in the time it took me to write the paragraph above I was just berated by bartender that I had time to have them make me another breakfast and suggested I was just complaining to get it free... rude, inappropriate, unprofessional and unbelievable! Yeah right... I have a little credit corporate card and sorry, breakfast was already covered by my company. Will not be back. Low class, no customer service or management presence. Frustrating experience to say the least. I hope to contact their corporate office shortly. At first I thought she was kidding, when I realized she was serious I was nearly speechless and yes, highly embarrassed and disrespected publicly.",

As soon as I hopped off my plane, there was Four Peaks and as I looked over the menu- my choices were narrowed down to the Arizona Chicken Rolls or the Garlic Cheese Beer Bread..both sounded delicious and I wish I had stomach space for both. But thanks to the AMAZING attitude, service, and energy of my cashier (wish I could remember her name, she was super lively and helpful at giving me the best option on the menu for a first timer) I went with the chicken roll.  I would describe it similar to egg rolls you get at Chinese restaurants but a million times better! Inside the lightly fried pastry, there is grilled chicken, Anaheim chile's, pepper jack cheese, cream cheese and accompanied with a really tasty sweet jalapeno dressing. I enjoyed it all, only two come in an order but they are a good enough size that I felt satisfied after eating one and saved the other one to give to my siblings on my trip to miami. Only $8 for the rolls and we'll worth it.",

I love the yoga events they hold and I've always had great service there. Obviously I'm not expecting a free yoga event here at the airport, but I have felt on multiple occasions that the service at the airport location is lacking. It may be due to the fact that I'm usually taking a red eye out of PHX and visit towards the end of the shift - after all, who's peppy when they've been at work all day? My Hop Knot was predictably cold and tasty, though a large beer ran me $10 which seemed excessive even for an airport bar. I didn't get a chance to eat at the most recent visit, but the chicken strips and salmon BLT are my absolute favorites!",

She is 100% honest when you ask her what she thinks of specific items.  She told me not to get a soup and I did.  She was more than willing to take it off the bill and get me something else to eat. All you gotta do is be polite and nice and everyone will go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The food was good for airport and bar food. Not exactly top notch but I was satisfied. The fries were the best! Natalie recommended trying all the different styles of ranch and they are fantastic.  Next time I'm going to have to come in for all the beers!",

Beer decent if you can get over the stench of a dirty bar. Food mediocre as I had to get my 2nd choice because they were out of the 1st. For as slow as it was and as many employees as they had working I would think someone could have asked me if my food was ok or if I wanted my empty glass refilled with another $8 beer. I thought when I brought my own water bottle out someone would have asked if I wanted water.  They were more concerned with changing tv stations to watch what they wanted and playing grab ass with each-other.",

But what they do have, they serve well ... and they do not skimp on them either. I had a sandwich that had lots of meat on it, and was well presented. Next time I am in the airport in Phoenix, and if I have the time to spend, I will be back. It was a pleasant diversion from the normal run run run and getting yelled at by TSA people.",
