Design by same people who did Postino's and Culinary Dropout.  Has the right amount of sound management.  Tasty food and fantastic happy hour menu.  Fabulous outdoor bar patio and separate dining patio.  We will be back!",

The service was great--super attentive and quick service.  The decor is very attractive.  But our food was not good.  My son's fried chicken was so mushy that he was afraid it was not cooked all the way through, and it was very salty.  My fish taco had very little fish in it, which was also soggy with little flavor.  One daughter thought her club sandwich was okay, but not exciting, and our other daughter said her ribs were okay.  Same with Hubby's burger.  All the fries were served cold!  I would have said something to the server, but my kids get embarrassed, lol. On top of all that, it was SO LOUD that we could barely hear each other. I guess we'll keep trekking to Phoenix to Angel Trumpet Ale House and to Gilbert to Wilderness Brewing, where the food and beers are tasty and a fair price.",

Love that they had varied seating including booths, high tops and regular tables. Decor is super fun. Was greeted by two friendly people who seated us right away in a booth by their open kitchen. The menu of both food, beer and cocktails is vast and impressive. Everyone can find both a beverage and dish to suit their tastes. We ordered the fried chicken sandwich, Cuban and BBQ bacon burger. Server was really great, friendly and accommodating. I can tell they run a tight ship, everything seemed to be well thought out and executed great! The hit was the chicken sandwich. The burger was great and tasty. Cuban was a smidge dry but still totally tasty. Prices are pretty normal. We had 3 entrees and one beer and our bill was $47. Pretty standard. I look forward to visiting again and trying the different entrees and cocktails. Great job guys! Welcome to the neighborhood! I have no complaints. Totally worth the visit.",

Took forever to get a new order finally the manager came over and I asked him if the waitress had sent him over as she told my party she was going to relate to him and the Chef to put a rush on it! He said he did not know but they had 3 Managers working!! Seems like quite a staff to pay. The rest of my party of 3 had almost finished eating!! I told him just forget my meal I wasn't going to reorder and he never apologized just said well you can walk out anytime the meal is on us!! Not the best customer service for a manager to not try and make amends besides a free meal. Loved the atmosphere so may give it another go round!!",

The owner came to our table and welcomed us with a short back story of how he and his wife opened the place. Our server was punctual and friendly, while not overbearing. We order the chicken marsala and blackened chicken pasta dishes. Both were outstanding, well prepared, perfect seasoning, and delivered to our table not too fast and not too slow. Overall service was spot-on and the food was delicious. They also have a very extensive brew menu of local favorites and micro brews. The music was good and not too loud (mix of 70's, 80's and 90's), and great ambiance. We'll definitely be back.",

The cheeseburger was so huge I had to take half of it home but my friend devoured the whole plate.  Both meals were above average and definitely deserves a return trip.",

There was a woman, who I believe was a manager of some sort, who was so friendly and picked up slack of waiters. Waited 45 minutes for food and didn't get the appetizer we ordered. I had someone else come by to get refills and when I asked a question on a drink I received a response of \"I don't drink alcohol\" - a little shocking to not be educated on what you are serving. Our waiter was sub par and I would believe that to be the case even if they were slow. Food and drinks were good. We will definitely come back just looking forward to trying when slower.",

We both had the house cut fries as well. Food was decent. My pretzel bun was soggy by the time I got it and both of our fries tasted like they were made hours ago sitting under a hot lamp. They are hard and not fresh. The manager came over and asked us about the food, we told him what our opinions were and he offered to get us new fries, but we were already done eating at that point. He was very nice and accommodating. I did mention to him the lady at the front handing food off to the runners was poking her bare fingers in burgers and grabbing things to fix on plates while handling checks and other things. It was completely grossed out. He said it was normal for them to do that. Based on the quality of the food, it was over priced and I don't want someone's fingers inside my food. Probably won't return.",

Hop Social is (or has been) one of our favorite spots to eat at. Food has always been top notch.   What did not go well is waiting almost an hour for food to hit our table and it was for myself and my younger daughter. No cocktails or appetizers, just two regular menu dinners. The part that makes it tough is NO ONE checked, stopped by, explained delays, nothing. We sat unattended and surrounded by empty tables. This, in my opinion, is one of the worst things any service staff should ever do or allow.   And just to add some more to this waiting game, I also had to wait for someone to come by so I could pay and end this 2.5 hour debacle.  I am going to try and treat this as a \"first time shame on you, second time shame on me\" type situation but my awareness is up and unfortunately I will be extremely skeptical on my next visit (which will not be any time soon)  Please Hop Social do not make this a normal type scenario moving forward. I am trying to remain a fan.",

    "text": "Mixed feelings about Hop Social. Went for the first time a week ago. We were a party of 4 and sat in the bar area because it was very busy as it was a Friday night. The food took quite some time to come out once we ordered but our server made up for it as she kept the drinks coming and provided excellent service overall. The owner David came by our table and checked in on us. He was very nice. He shared the story behind opening the restaurant.   So for the food...I ordered the fried chicken dinner. The chicken and the potatoes were delicious! The cole slaw was terrible. And I love cole slaw so I was a bit disappointed. There was too much dressing (Miracle Whip and not mayonnaise maybe??). My daughter ordered the burger. It was very dry and meat was almost crumbly. Hubby had the Chile Verde nachos. Loaded with meat and very tasty. Huge portion! He loved it. He also liked the huge variety of beers on tap.   Ambiance was nice. Large bar area and 2 different patios if you want to sit outdoors.   Fast forward about a week later. We visited for the 2nd time at 4:30 pm or so on Saturday. It wasn't nearly as busy as our first visit. Plenty of open tables when we were seated. Hubby ordered the fish tacos and enjoyed it. He also had a California roll. Said you could tell it was fresh. I had the fried chicken again although I really wanted to try the pot pie. In hindsight, maybe I should have. My son in law also ordered the fried chicken dinner and my daughter ordered the fried chicken sandwich. We brought our friend who was in from Germany as well and he had some sort of beef sandwich. The fried chicken dinner was disappointing this go around. A bit dry and over cooked. My son in law ended up getting a chicken sandwich in spite of ordering the dinner. The runner had it fixed within a few minutes. Appreciated. However! The service was atrocious! Or should I say lack of service. Again, food coming out was extremely slow. Sara was our server. She rarely checked on us. Never apologized for the slow service. Never filled our drinks until we flagged her down. At one point, we bussed our own table because we were tired of having our dirty dishes on our table so I got up and put them on the table next to us. We never got her attention and most of the time couldn't find her when we needed anything. I'd highly recommend requesting at the time of seating to NOT sit in her section. This visit ran us about $135.   Anyway, the place seems to have pretty decent food for the most part. Expect very slow service in regards to getting your food once you order. I'd highly recommend not going here if you're in a rush. We did learn they offer Happy Hour 7 days a week. Specials seem pretty good. We may try it one more time. Maybe.",

Their alcoholic drinks were pretty awesome and such a reasonable price even off the happy house menu. We also split a barbecue chicken flat bread on the happy hour menu, it was pretty good, maybe could've used a little more barbecue sauce, but overall pretty darn good especially for the price! Servers are not overly friendly or efficient, but I think the atmosphere makes of up that. Will definitely be back",

    "text": "Five (5) stars () for Angel who was tending bar our first night.  She provided such a great experience I knew we would be back. We have been here twice since discovering this place and I was wishing we had come here the previous night.   I love the ambience here.  It's a relaxed, sorta comfy gathering spot.  Even when I looked around it felt like this is a good place to gather with friends, enjoy some great beers, nosh on some tasty Happy Hour nibbles (these are enough for a meal, especially if you plan to have the donut dessert), relax and unwind.  Ya think the couches contributed to that impression? Anyhoo... The beers are fantastic.  The gluten restriction had to be overlooked once I gazed at the options and tasted my first sample. I could have tasted all of the beers they were serving - you know, if time permitted.  I was just Wowed!  I suppose I was hooked.  Sours, IPAs, Porters, Stouts , Ales, Kolsch, many more and a few aren't on the menu. Happy Hour is 3-6 and their reverse Happy Hour begins at 9:30.  A full HH menu along with drink specials -or special drinks, if you prefer.   Oh, can't forget to mention they do allow *dogs on their patio.   *Please, please, if you do bring you dog, be a responsible pet owner and POTTY your dog in advance.  If dog does have an accident, clean it up promptly and efficiently.  So gross approaching entrance and seeing AND smelling dog poo on sidewalk and in nearby garden. Ya wonder why places don't want pets allowed?  And word to the wise, dogs don't \"want to say hello\" so keep your pet in check and nobody gets hurt.  Once again I was drawn in by at least one review which caused me to bookmark this place. Glad my hubby suggested we give this place a try.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a place that is a mixture of hip sports bar, craft beer bar and great pub food, this is the place.  As someone who has worked in the hospitality industry and dined in likely hundreds of different brewpubs in sports bars, I think this one is at that benchmark that the others should aspire to be.  Here are the winners: The craft beer selection isn't the biggest, but I would say it's fairly diverse and very open to those that may not have ever had a craft beer.  If you are looking for a foreign beer, this isn't the place. They do have a few bottles, but 99.9% of the beer they sell is draft beer from the US, with quite a large number from Arizona.  The food: my wife and I got two different burgers from their menu and I will say that the presentation was fantastic but what preceded the burgers was even better. We got their homemade hot fresh donuts as an appetizer. Do yourself a favor, get these and have a nice dark but sweeter style beer with it. I recommend the Dawn of the Red by Ninkasi. The taste of the dough with the cinnamon and the nice crisp outer crust was great but then the warm dipping sauce that they give you just made it fantastic.  As for the burgers, my wife got a bourbon burger and I got a Gorgonzola stuffed burger. Both were cooked perfectly, the burgers tasted very fresh, the buns were exceptional and the fries that accompanied it were not standard shoe string or ribbon fries, they were Oil fries along the lines of those produced by folks like 5 Guys but without an overpowering seasoning.  Something of note for the beer crowd: the draft lines were obviously very clean simply by the way the beer taste in the glass and the glasses were beer clean. Beautiful lacing on all of the glasses, no noticeable odors whatsoever coming off of them and I was extremely impressed with the only exception that you get offered a larger size, a tall, and I was a bit put off by that because of the size of the glass only because I wanted a more traditional style glass for an IPA.  But again, the glass was beautiful, it was clean and it was done right.  Finally, our server, Ashley, was fantastic. Polite, timing could not have been better, nice recommendations, but she wasn't hovering and made us feel welcome even though it was our only our first visit. All the servers were extremely polite and well-dressed but casual in their tops and nice jeans; the place is impeccable down to the cleanliness of the bathrooms and even the glass on the front door.  For those that may not like beer, there is a short wine list but a fantastic cocktail list including handcrafted cocktails. The place is a total win.",

Saw one waitress scratching something off the ice scoop with her fingers while the bartender watched. They didn't clean the scoop and continued to use it to serve drinks.

The location is great, the atmosphere is great, reservation keeping is phenomenal, table waiting for us rather than just being prioritized for the next one on arrival, and you're greeted by the friendliest people on the planet.  The wait-staff have long lost their ability to give a f**k. I had no clue this place had a full bar, the waitress never gave us a drinks menu. When clearing the table next to us, the waiter dropped silverware and just kicked it under the table, which was never picked up even when the next people were seated there.  3 times manager-type people stopped by to see how we were doing, the first time, I admit (Dave) I said nothing to you. I should have, my burger was about raw. We did mention it to the next manager type woman that came by who offered to warm it up after she saw what it looked like on the inside, but I declined and just charged on hoping for a good dessert.  Oh boy... dessert, the apple cobbler (I think it was cobbler) was great apparently, which is what my partner got. I got the cheesecake. I don't know how you screw up cheesecake, but they managed to find a way to make it taste like rubber. When manager type #3 (bald man with glasses) asked how dessert was, I replied 'terrible', to which I got the surreal answer \"I know right!, let's torch the place! Okay you guys, have a good meal.\" and then he left.  We won't be back.",

From the being greeted, seated, served and visited by the manager, I really felt like it was their mission that we enjoyed our dinner tonight. Every dish excelled. I went simple with the fish and chips. True beer battered and reminded me of something I had in Australia. Wife had the steak salad, very nice. Little guys mac n cheese was enticing me to steal a bite. This place is highly recommended.",

I met up with my friends here a few weeks ago and sat out on the large patio. Our server was a nice guy who was happy to put in a food order for our friend who was on her way and put in her drink order the second she arrived so she could take advantage of happy hour too.   We shared the artichoke dip to start, and it had me longing for the stuff they sell at Costco. The fries were slightly better but nothing special. That's all I tried at Hop Social since there aren't many other vegetarian options.   The best part of the evening was the cider I got on draft. It was very tasty, and my friend got an order too after having a sip of mine. I'm not a beer drinker at all so I appreciate that they had 3 ciders on tap. For my second drink, I got their happy hour margarita, and I was less impressed. Stick with the taps!",

We've been coming to Hop since it opened and loved everything we ordered:  Cheeseburgers, P/B/J Burger, Chicken Sandwich, Sushi, Pretzels, Salmon, Fish and Chips, Kung Pow Chicken, Pastrami Sandwich, and more.  Hop immediately became our new favorite so we dined here often.  The food was delicious and the portions were huge.  Heaven!   After being away for much of the summer, we came for lunch today.  Wow, have things changed.  No longer is the food piled high on the plate (with the exception of the coleslaw...still plenty of that), nor does it arrive steaming hot.  We ordered fish and chips which used to be a favorite.  Total disappointment.  Rather than the fresh cut pieces of crispy fish they used to serve, the new version includes a small pile of room-temperature fries with three uniformly sliced \"circles\" of fish (?)  placed on top.  The batter was soggy and flavorless.  At least 1/3 (the perimeter) of the plate was empty and that never used to be the case.    We watched other dishes as they were delivered to nearby tables.  Most looked the same as ours:  Average portion sizes (at best) without the  \"wow\" factor that used to keep us coming back. We returned our entrees (which management comped) went home and ate lunch.   It seems that Hop, sadly, now serves the same sub par food as most East Valley restaurants and is more focused on cost-cutting than dishing up the high quality and delicious food we used to love.  We'll try it one more time in the hopes that this was a one-off, but that will be it.  Life is too short to eat mediocre food!",

She asked us if we wanted tall or short.  We said tall, but she neglected to inform us that size was not on happy hour so we were surprised when the bill came.  The same bartender took our food order.  We ordered an appetizer and the stuffed salmon, then that bartender left for the day.  We received the appetizer, but she never put our food order in.  When we asked another bartender about our main course, he checked and implied it was never ordered in the system.

Both my fiance and I ordered burgers, we waited 30+ minutes for these burgers to arrive (which is fine because they were busy). Once we received our food we were quick to eat as we were very hungry. Unfortunately though my fiance's burger was so wet and greasy the bun was soggy and inedible. I ordered a blue cheese stuffed burger, to my dismay when biting into it the burger was plain and contained no cheese inside, the frys that came with it were also cold and hard as a rock, completely inedible. When we brought the attention of it to our waitress she was quick to apologize and get her manager. When the manager Brittney came over she was quick to dismiss the issue and stated the burger was stuffed with cheese when it clearly wasn't. Due to the fact there was issues with both of our expensive burgers we were hoping for a better resolution. Once the bill claim the manager did not even bother to take at least one of the faulty burgers off our tab! Super disappointed with the customer service consider we come here often and usually spend close to $100 every time. We will definitely be taking our money elsewhere.",

Even though their food is truly delicious, unique & diverse. Unfortunately the wait staff is sub par. Both times we came for dinner, each of which were somewhat busy, No wait and empty tables.  On one of the visits, we arrived at about 4:45pm on a Friday for early dinner. The host asked if we thought we would be done by 6:15pm which I thought was odd and strange to ask being that it was fairly empty. Her explanation, that the table she was seating us at had a reservation at that time.   During both dinner visits, being a server in the past I know industry standards on greeting times and revisiting the table. None of which this servers did.   Both visits it took both servers about 5 mins to come and say hi & get our drink order.    On that Friday visit you can see the servers hanging out chatting near the expo / register area. It was amazing to see the lack in the sense of urgency with us literally sitting in front of them. It was extremely difficult to get our female server to ask us if we needed anything.   Lastly, during both dinner visits we experienced a very BAD fruit fly situation.  On the first visit they comped one of the beers because so many flies got trapped in the beer it was pretty gross. We kept swating during both meals too.",

So I sit at the bar and cannot even believe the fly infestation at the beer pour station! Super gross! I order a passionfruit spritzer and it's warm.. I am constantly trying new drinks here and constantly let down. Trust me, I am giving HST the benefit of the doubt and they are a let-down over and over again. I order chicken tenders and steak bites which were yummy and the drizzle on the steak bites complements the steak well. I did notice however, while my phone was dead how many people don't \"socialize\" everyone was on there phone. Employees, managers, bartenders.. It was $30 spent in vain.  The bar was really open, not packed. Lot's of open seats and in the past the wait used to be insane! Hop Social needs a time-out and refresher.",

The vibe works well for those who are looking for a fun bar vibe (at the bar area), group dining, or for a more quiet area in the back so you can have great conversation.   We met them on a Saturday night and made a reservation. Our server was phenomenal - well versed in the menu, sarcastic and prompt. She let us know when to get our orders in after a large party was sat to ensure that we didn't have to wait too long. She also encouraged us to sample certain beers after asking what type of beers we liked to find new kinds of beers we could like. I tried a beer that tasted great but definitely had a clorox aftertaste (just the way the beer is brewed) and we all had a good laugh about that. We ordered beer and appetizers, all were absolutely delicious. The boys got pretzels and we got the spinach dip.   For dinner, I had the poke, Brittany had the pasta, fiance had the shepherd's pie and Matt had fried chicken.   The food, drinks and desserts were incredible. Atmosphere was great, and service was a 10/10. We would definitely return and can't wait to try more of what they have to offer.",

We are greeted quickly, and if there is a wait for a table, they ask for your cell number to text you when a table has opened up. The food is amazing. It's always hot, fresh, and tasty. We love the atmosphere, and the music is always catchy. Last time we were in for dinner, the owner, owner's wife, and manager all came up to us at separate times to introduce themselves and to get to know us. They were going table to table, and it's clear they care about their customers as they were asking for feedback. The bathrooms are always clean and the service is quick. We love the spinach dip appetizer, and I usually get the BBQ chicken pizza. My boyfriend usually gets the ahi tuna bowl.  As long as Hop Social keeps doing things right, we will continue to visit time and time again.",

We were seated at our table around 6pm and it took our server about 20 minutes just to bring us water after we had asked. Once our food was delivered I asked if we could get some ketchup for our fries and she returned 15 minutes later with a tiny amount of sauce. Literally about 2 tbsp of ketchup for two people to share. As I was eating my fries she literally took my plate away while I was chewing my food and didn't even ask if I was finished. Same with our drinks. She grabbed my husbands beer when he had about 1/4 of his beer left. We let her know that he was not finished and she looked annoyed and stormed away.    A month later we decided to try again. Only because the food was so good. Certainly we couldn't have horrible service two visits in a row, right? WRONG! The food was delicious however I don't don't think we will return. Literally just horrible service ever. Such a shame because they really do have a fantastic menu",

Our table tried the pretzel and cheese dip as an appetizer. The cheese sauce was amazing. For dinner we shared the Cuban pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw. The pork was perfectly cooked with lots of flavor. The coleslaw was very crunchy and very tasty. We also ordered the Thai prawn linguine which was delicious as well. We were treated to a banana berry Sunday, great way to end the meal. There's something for everyone on the menu. The portions are perfect for sharing. Looking forward to returning and trying something different. Hope they open a location in the West Valley soon.",

I had the Chili Verde Nachos, the Bison burger was also very good, but our favorite was the soft pretzels with beer cheese!!

    "text": "Just found this place driving by and decided to try it. Fantastic!! 52+ craft beers and (my personal favorite part) 3 ciders! And thank goodness none of the ciders was that horrible Angry Orchard every other place carries. I had the Desert Dragon cider - very good. We had the donut appetizer (non traditional, but how can you turn down fresh, hot cinnamon donuts with caramel sauce?) Yum! I had the buttermilk fried chicken, which is deboned, so it has the flavor of bone-in, but is much easier to eat. We all enjoyed our meals and agreed we'd be back soon. Our server, Erika, was also fabulous: super friendly, super helpful. It was a terrific evening!",

    "text": "We were really pleasantly surprised by Hop Social. We stopped by during Happy Hour on a whim before going to a movie at the nearby theatre. I had visited the building previously when it was still Elephant bar and was curious to see what it looked like now. The place looks completely different now. At first, I was worried that we would be late as the place was rather crowded. That wasn't the case at all. We were informed the Happy Hour menu was only available at the bar and on the patio, so we sat on the patio. The set-up out there is really nice. Large shades block the view of the parking lot and the cushion seats and high top tables create a really welcoming environment. The misters helped with the spring heat. We were promptly greeted and ordered our beers. The beer menu is fantastic and I was able to get one of my all time favorites from a smaller brewery (Tower Station IPA from Mother Road Brewery in Flagstaff). We ordered three different dishes from the Happy Hour menu - the fish tacos, Kung Pao lettuce cups and the steak dish. Everything was brought out really quickly despite how busy they were. We were able to get a really decently sized dinner out of these three dishes as the items on the Happy Hour menu are full-sized.  Overall, we really enjoyed Hop Social. We were able to get four beers and three dishes for under $40. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places. For many reasons. It has a great patio, the sporty bar is nice for sitting at if you're a single gal looking for a quick bite,  and it's swanky enough you can bring the out of town guests for a really nice dinner in their dining room. Not many places that can say they are ALL of these things. Angel, who bartends evenings, is amazing. I went in by myself the other night and asked for a menu after spending the day at the hospital with my husband, she looked at me and said, 'get the beef tips, you won't regret it'. I did and I will order them again! Talk about nice reasonably priced comfort food. Very tasty, beef tips in a Cabernet sauce, flash fried onion strings, garlic mashed potatoes and perfectly prepared asparagus. Nice wine selection and loads of beers on tap as well as cocktails. Everyone is polite, excellent cross section of clientele, from business people to those looking to grab a beer and watch the game and those who want a little nosh on the patio. Great happy hour too! You can't beat this place!",

The gravy that is served with it is amazing, I could literally drink it by itself. My dish was mediocre at best. I had the blackened chicken feta pasta dish. The server did say it was a tad spicy. I don't like spicy food so she recommended plain chicken breast. I got the dish and there was hardly any sauce. What I was tasting was very bland and honestly boring. I asked for more sauce and they accommodated. The sauce was wine based so that was the consistency. It was very light in flavor which explains why the dish is bland. Would I order it again, no but the food I saw at other tables looked amazing. If you are looking for a light dish then this is the one for you however. The server took my dish off the bill without us asking her too. That was greatly appreciated. We will be back for sure!",

She was so accommodating and very honest in her opinions of the food and drinks they serve. Our food came out in an impressive amount of time and tasted delicious.

Each time we've visited we have asked that the music is turned down it is so obnoxiously loud.  We are happy to have this as an option and will go back   Hoping they take the music request to heart.",

Sadly of all things you would think a place like this would want you to drink and have a good time but apparently they enforce 4 drink maximum regardless of how long you have been there. Well at least this rules applies to folks who are of any ethnic background, (the folks next to us were on their 3rd drink that hour and had been there since 6 pm, it was 9 pm when I asked them).I wouldn't go as far as to say this place discriminates because they did hire a 4 ft 2 inch ginger only a mother can love as a manager. But I will say stay clear of this place if you plan on having a good night or want a decent meal. It is very out of character for me to leave a bad review or complain at the end of the day it's a business and it feeds many mouths. But this place is True disappointment.",

    "text": "Folks say that 3rd times a charm. Ummmm... not so much in this case. I went to dinner with 4 of my girlfriends and came to Hop Social. We don't get to have dinner with each other often so it's a big deal when we select a place where we can enjoy food, sippy sips and catch up. One GF called for reservations earlier but was informed that we should be ok for a group of 5 to eat dinner at 6 and should be able to get in with no problem.  We actually arrived 15 min early only to find out that they were not seating any more people at tables bc the kitchen was backed up. (There were empty available tables so it was clear no one was being seated.) We were told it would be 45 min, maybe less, to wait for a table. We waited about 15 min and were seated in the patio.  We ordered a round of drinks and 2 appetizers-- pretzel bread and artichoke dip. Drinks and water came out fairly timely. We ordered our meals-- veggie burger, blackened chicken pasta, medium burger with pepper jack, bison burger, fried chicken and 1 to-go order of pot pie. Appetizers took 45 min to arrive.  After 1.5 hrs, another  GF gets a call on her cell and it was the hostess calling to tell us our table was ready.  She informed them that we were already seated in the patio for the last 1.5 hrs.   Our food finally arrives almost 2 hours later. Our medium burgers were rare, veggie burger was cold, fried chicken was raw and actually our GF who ordered the pasta liked it. We did order drinks in between while waiting for the main dinner. As time went on we got hungrier and angrier.  We watched food delivered to different tables but they were the wrong tables. Servers and managers running around not knowing where orders belonged.   Fast forward to a Manager-In-Training (blonde) who came to our table to check on how things were going. We were very honest and told her exactly how it went... \"not a good experience at all\". We shared how long everything took and she firmly tried to correct us on timing. We shared the exact timing of when we got there, what we ordered, and how long it took. She begged to differ. Word of advice, Manager-In-Training, when you approach a table and ask for feedback, be prepared for honesty. You may not always like it but you have to own up to a sh@t show when it happens. Also, when things aren't going great, do your best to turn it around. Do not throw your employees under the bus like you did our waitress. Own it bc you have the power to take a crappy situation, turn it around and make things better.  Instead you came across rude with an attitude and defensive. And, yes you offered us dessert but your \"attempt\" was not genuine and all we wanted was out. You def need more training bc you are not ready.   As for our waitress, Halona, if you are reading this, we want you to know that the table of 5 ladies you had tonight appreciate you! We applaud you! You held yourself together in the middle of chaos surrounding you. You kept your cool. Your remained attentive and sweet. You apologized oh-so-many-times. We are sorry you were caught in the crossfires which is why we made sure you knew how we felt about you in person and now on yelp. Keep your head up and we wish you better days bc you worked your tail off tonight. Thank you. Thank you for your kind and genuine nature.   To the other manager (short dark hair)... thank you for coming to our table and genuinely caring. You came at the height of aggravation You listened to us. You felt us. You apologized. Thank you for handling it the appropriate way. Thank you for picking up the food tab.   I am a frequent customer to Hop Social. I'm unsure as to what is happening as far as it declining bc this would be my go-to place to meet people for work meetings, lunch, dinner and happy hour. This is my 3rd visit in a row in which service has been a huge disappointment. The first disappointment was when the restaurant had all these fruit flies all over the restaurant. I had set up a lunch meeting with my coworkers and it had not only been distracting but obviously unappetizing.   During my next visit, I met a GF for dinner. Somehow my food was mixed up (beet salad) and made incorrectly. My GF's order was fine and she got to eat while I waited an additional 30 min for you to correct it. She was pretty much done with her food.   So for me to still come tonight after the other 2 experiences is proof that I still believed in this restaurant. After tonight, I will never come back. I will not set up another meeting with anyone. I will not come back to enjoy lunch or dinner with a loved one. I will not even come in to order a glass of water bc that's how awful our experience was tonight.   It's very sad bc this place was once a fun favorite of mine.",

    "text": "I, along with a few of my friends, visited Hop Social evening of May 8. The purpose was to enjoy happy hour and celebrate my girlfriend's birthday.  One of my friend and I were seated.  As we waited, not one server greeted us or offered us water. We waited there for several minutes. When somebody did approach our table it was the hostess telling us we had been inadvertently sat at tables that were reserved and kindly asked if we could move to the tables immediately behind us. Of course we moved; not a problem. But we continued to sit there with no server; still no water offered, or anyone asking if we were waiting for more in our party. Finally, about 10 to 15 minutes into our musical chairs sitting , we had to flag down the hostess again stating that we had not been serviced.  She agreed to get us some water.  She then must have gotten our server who then came to our table and seemed surprised even though he could have clearly seen us in his section.   The service was still poor after that.  One ordered an appetizer at the same time I did; I got mine and she chalked it up to \"it'll be out soon\".  She finally had to ask our server about her order.  He didn't write it down.  Another GF & her daughter orders an appetizer of chips and dip (can't recall if it were spinach or artichoke).  It was cold.  They asked someone else, not our server but someone checking on the table, to get a warmer order as this wasn't very warm at all.    Overall, the food is good at Hop Social and the cocktail selection as great; the service is definitely to be desired.  I was very disappointed.",

They have 50+ beers on draft, but I stuck mostly to my porter/stouts. They also have some chocolatey ones, but these were a bit too sweet for me.  The overall atmosphere was casual and a great choice for having a few drinks with friends. They also serve food/appetizers. I didn't order any, but from what I saw from others, they looked tastey!",

Coworker and I both had salads which we enjoyed thoroughly.  Kale salad was a great light option. My only gripe would be the chicken breast which I barely touched because it was dry and rubbery.  Tasted liked it was a frozen breast that has been cooked earlier and then reheated. I wasn't very hungry so it wasn't the end of the world.   Service was on point.  The waitresses did seem a little annoyed with us because we weren't ready to order the multiple times they checked up on us, but at least they kept coming back and didn't give up on us.  I can appreciate that. Would come back here to try more menu items.  Saw many orders of donuts go to tables so it must be a thing.",

You may notice upon first review of the menu that they offer donuts as as appetizer. Do it. Get the donuts.   Great beer and other alcohol selections and the vibe and staff are also upbeat and fun.

They have a pretty expansive happy hour menu especially in terms of food; however I think they should add a couple happy hour cocktails as alternatives to the margarita. I also wish they made the margarita with fresh juice. Those are the kinds of touches that would really elevate this place. I think they need to do a new menu as well as improve upon dishes that they keep around. Almost everything I've had here could use just a tiny flavor boost, garnish or sauce to really sell me on the item. They need to add items that people really crave.  Sweet potato fries and a dipping sauce like delux burger (similar to cane's sauce) would probably have me here a few times a week. The beer cheese soup is delish. Add a pretzel stick on the side. The neon sign is weird...",

To not alarm her, I asked her to stand and move to the other side of the patio. She never listens to me but this time she sees I'm not messing with her and follows my instruction. There was a very large roach just a few inches away from her. When we alerted the staff of this they acted as if it was happens often. We won't be back and strongly suggest the same for you.   Tom",

    "text": "The pros: Cool atmosphere, decent food, and good happy hour.   The cons: Unfortunately the bartenders at this restaurant are more distracted that a kid with ADD in the outfield of a tee ball game. In the unlikely event I ever come back here, I am going to order my drinks and then go catch a flick at Harkins.  If I stay through all the credits, they should just about be ready by the time I get back provided I walk.   The highlight of our most recent and likely final visit was after waiting 30 mins for a drink, my girlfriend ordered a house Merlot. When another patron asked the bartender what kind of wine it was he drew from his knowledge as a high level sommelier and replied \"The Sh*tty Kind, haha.\"    This place could be great, but only after Jon Taffer comes in to smash a couple liquor bottles and berate the bartending staff to pay more attention to paying customers than their Instagram feed.",

We sat in the bar area, and Carlos was our terrific server.  He was excellent.    For a starter my friend and I shared the hot, soft pretzels with cheese dip.  Sooooo good!   For entrees, my friend had the beef medallions with fresh asparagus and mashed potatoes.  She loved it.  I had the Thai Prawns on linguini, and they were excellent.  Nice sized prawns in a slightly spicy peanut sauce.   We each enjoyed a craft cocktail and were equally impressed with taste, presentation and quality of ingredient. I had the Tennessee Honey something and my friend had the salted caramel martini. Actually, the drinks were so good we each had 2.",

We took a slice of cheesecake home to eat later that evening, that was amazing as well.   My only complaint is there is no refill on the ice teas. We ordered a few refills and were surprised to see $14 of our bill was for iced tea. Our waiter never mentioned that refills weren't free like most restaurants do.

The second manager was great....she comped our food and apologized....very nice and professional...and our waitress was wonderful.

Based on two separate experiences seating takes forever, beers take 10 minutes to be delivered, plates show up soaking wet, food takes 40+ minutes from pad to table. Staff is working hard but lack management structure and streamlining.  Advice to management: You need to learn how to scale your ops if you're going to continue to run at 80% dating capacity. People keep coming because your food and atmosphere is better than most options but you've had enough time to get operations dialed in. Do better.",

    "text": "Disappointed because we wanted to love it.   Server was upbeat and personable. She gave her opinions on some food items when we asked and we appreciated her honesty.  Beer selection is large. Not sure you are going find limited release taps here, for example. I was hoping to discover and try something new, but it was ok for what we wanted.  They brought the side salad for my husband after his burger came.  Should have come before his entree.  They forgot to make my dinner and they didn't realize it until my family was almost halfway through their meals. When the server came back to tell me it would still be a few more minutes, I told her to cancel my dinner order. Instead, I could just eat off my child's plate. I really was not upset, as my child did not like the dish much anyway and my husband said his food was nothing special so I figured we could save $15 and not waste my child's food. Then the manager came out and said she still wanted to make it. That was nice but I already said no so then I felt like I was being rude. After we were done with dinner, they made a card for my child and brought her an ice cream sundae as a special surprise. That was lovely, but I couldn't tell if that was for her or for my benefit.  Patterns in the reviews make me believe that the kitchen is the main problem. Several complaints of salads and apps coming with main courses, food being cold, etc. Our server even said \"The kitchen is a mess tonight.\" Hmmmn.",

What I rally liked was it was totally re made. I DO NOT like a salty margarita and usually they will just dump the salted rim margarita into a glass w/o salt which surprisingly I can taste. super glad they did not do that here! We also had the strawberry pear salad , super good and the Italian pizza. The pizza is the reason for the low number of stars. I ate a piece and mind you I was starving after playing golf all day. With every bite I kept hoping it would taste better. Like really, how do you mess up a pizza?? Well on the second piece i scraped off the toppings and the dough wasn't cooked at all I could literally stretch it like raw dough.  My husband showed it to our server and he took it off our bill after offering to remake it. That said I will be back to try it again because they handled it well and it seems like a great place.",

    "text": "We were excited to try this new place.  Great beer selection and menu.  The food was very good and loved all of the local and specialty draft beers.  We did have a couple of issues though.  First off, we were sat at a two person table that should not of been a table.  It was literally on top of the table next to us.  We were a part of their dinner.  I asked to be moved to another table and was denied.  I've never had a restaurant saw no when we asked to move.  They should not try to squeeze in this table, on top of another and in a very high traffic area.  The second issue was the length of time it took for dinner.  We we're there 30 minutes before our appetizer came and over an hour by the time dinner showed up.  All of the food we had was great, but service and the slowness of the food was unbearably slow.  We may try it again, we did enjoy it, but hopefully the figure out these delays soon.",

Two others had salmon - Scandinavian farm raised silver salmon, so not distinct flavor.  Mine was overcooked and very bland.  Other choice was sweet mustard sauce - too sweet.  Opted for sides of mashed potatoes and veg of day (NO kale), which were mushy baby reds - note to owners:  waxy potatoes should NOT be smashed because you end up with mushy mess.  Asparagus was mostly yellow and stringy... overcooked and old.  Interior stark modern with big green sofa/banquet bench in middle of room, cheap tables and chairs.  One huge open room = noisy when busy.  Have a salad or a burger, go for huge beer menu (have several I need to try), and if you want to talk, steer clear of busy times.  Lose the *&@#$% kale!!!!!",

    "text": "So, my wife and I had been anxiously awaiting the grand opening of this new place for a while. Was excited for a new Hop Heavy beer place...This is a very hard review to give because the staff was friendly, the food was ok, and yet I find myself debating between 2 or 3 stars. The bottom line is that it feels NO different than a corporate franchise like Red Robin or Applebee's once you are inside at the bar. The beer choices were limited in the sense that you've already had everything they have to offer (only for half the price at any other bar). They have like 5 beers on Happy Hour, and those are still $5 even on HH?! The others are $7 and more. The happy hour food was ok, but nothing special. They spent months and tons of money transforming this place from the old Elephant Bar only to make it just as corporate and Blahh as every other mall bar you've been to. Please either be super unique or super cheap, you just can't have it both ways. Won't be back.",

    "text": "In response to Misti's 1 star review.....I work in the service industry, and I have been involved in many new restaurant openings (NROs). There are always kinks to be worked out, and if the computer systems are down, then a smart company closes to ensure that the guest does not suffer. This is even more True with a new concept in a new area. Why would a company want a customer to come in and experience exceptionally long waits for food and drinks? The issue is out of the restaurant's hands and many customers would not understand. I went to Hop Social for dinner last night and found the professionalism, menu choices and service to be above anything I have experienced anywhere else in Chandler. The staff is so personable. My server was incredibly knowledgeable. He helped my wife decide on a beer that she loved, and I got a beer flight. We met the owner, and 2 different managers. The presentation of the food was beyond expectation.   Please do not take Misti's review as a \"sign.\" She probably just posted out of anger because she didn't get to experience what so many of us have been able to.",

She walked us to the table closest to the kitchen/silverware rolling station, and gave us the heads up about the table bases, which was nice. The caprese salad was awesome for starters, our entrees were the bison burger and fish & chips, which were all 12 out of 10. The service was probably the worst I've had in 10 years unfortunately. My girlfriends beer came out and was delivered from the bartender since it was dying in the well. I ordered a Mr. Pibb which arrived 5-6 minutes after the beer. A blonde young lady delivered our food and didn't say a word? Just dropped it and bolted ASAP. Who wouldn't give those entrees with ketchup or even ask if you need anything else? It was clearly after they just cut down to probably the closing servers because they were spread out all over the restaurant. She walked by us maybe 12-15 times without a glance. My empty plate was in front of me so long I set it on the silverware rolling station where it sat until after we left. Feel free to check your cameras if you have them. Zero awareness of what was happening after the dinner rush ended by everyone in the building except Cat. I told her on the way out she was the best thing that the restaurant had going, which she was blown away hearing.",

First time I had the shrimp tacos, they were ok. Last night I had the meatloaf and not sure about you but I do not appreciate when stuff that is not listed on the menu shows up, like the crispy onions and green onion twirl, plus the meatloaf was spicy, like a hot sauce spicy.  Was not described that way. My 3 1/2yo did not like the kids mac n cheese; it was too good, too gourmet, i.e, not Kraft. They brought her chicken tenders as a replacement that she liked and we appreciated that. We don't like the tables - if you sit close to the table, your chair leg rests on the base and then you rock, so the chairs/tables aren't totally comfy. We'll probably come back again because it's an overall good place in a good location, but we'll be more discriminatory about the entree choices and maybe ask for a booth to bypass the table base issues.",

I kept mine because I don't care enough to send food back (I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with the aioli the side, it came with no sauce, bacon on the side, and entirely cold) My father had an entirely wrong entree, and my mother's food was burnt. I finished my meal and waited with them for 30 minutes until having to leave for another commitment, their food had still not arrived at this point. I later heard that my mom's food was equally as burnt as the first go round but my dad's order was all right. In the end my parents were not charged for their food, but the bill was $24 for my sandwich and a single well gin drink before tip. The drink was literally doubled the price we have seen at any other restaurant.  They have a wide beer selection which is nice, I wish they offered sours though. If you are going out to drink then this is probably your place, but spending over 2 hours for bad food is definitely not worth it.",

They have appetizers and small plates that are anywhere from about $4-7 and they are all really good portion sizes for the prices. I love ordering one or two as a meal!  The pretzels and beer cheese and fish tacos (pictured) are my favorite. Surprisingly, they make great sushi as well. They have a plethora of beer and wine selections and the $5 happy hour margaritas are always great. Beware, though, that happy hour is only served in the bar area.  Hop Social is always consistent in both flavor of food and service. The staff is always very friendly and service is quick. Their outdoor seating area is a great place to enjoy your meal.  Would definitely recommend, especially if you're looking for a weekend happy hour.",

I ordered a glass of wine and fries to start which came out right away. Some of the fries were a little soft, but some were crispy, but I didn't really care because I was so hungry. Got the steak salad, changed the dressing to the lemon vinaigrette. The steak was pretty thin medallions with a great smoky flavor, it was as medium rare/rare as I would've liked it, but I think it would've been difficult to achieve based in the thin cuts. Overall, it was really and the crispy Brussel sprouts were a nice bonus.",

Then we ordered solely from the happy hour menu but did not directly tell the waitress \"hey, we are ordering from the happy hour menu\" because I have never had to do that anywhere else. Then the check came back and nothing was happy hour price. They told us we had to sit in the other area to get happy hour and that the plates we were given were regular dining size plates not happy hour plates so they had to be charged full price. We were a little annoyed but we understood and paid and left.  They should definitely be more clear about happy hour rules. If you see us ordering solely from the happy hour menu, how about you mention this stuff? They have great happy hour specials and I think people would enjoy them but I recommend you make sure to ask your server exactly what you have to do in order to get the happy hour specials.",

I know that winery well...see pic from the day after the Atlas Peak!  Selected the Cab Tips.   WELL, that was great!  Tender chunks of fillet in a wine sauce with creamy mashed and asparagus.  Come on, it's only Monday!  I'm in town all week and I will be back for an other selection.  Can't try them all this trip...but hey, there's no rush.  Come here!!!",

Once we got there, I was afraid the atmosphere would be too rowdy or too loud for my 9 month old, but I was mistaken. The customer service was great, the atmosphere was decent for a bar/restaurant, and the food was delightful. I ordered a strawberry apple salad, my niece ordered their fish and chips, my 9-month old loved her own little platter of mashed potatoes & my other half got a burger (of course) We were all satisfied and stuffed to the brim =) Happy family",

Order your drink or food and just chillLevi, Chelsea..thanks for the effort to answer our many ??. Beer choices are many, some are great. 52 craft beers. Glasses need to be cold for every pour, not just when it's slow. The prices are excellent for the food amount. The bacon wrapped meatloaf was excellent, real potatoes were mashed. The gravy..tasty but just not sure where it is going. Either it needs to be tomato based or gravy or just something else...a real winner though..ended with donuts..delicious!",

We went last night at 5:00 and the bar was packed so sat at a table just on the other side of the wall from the bar. Ordered the house wine thinking would be getting HH prices since HH lasts until 6. We were very disappointed to hear they only do HH pricing in the bar. Most restaurants in the area - especially since Hop Social has the open concept - offers HH pricing no matter where you sit. The bar is very small and with the summer coming, the outside patio will not be doable, so unless you are one of the lucky few who actually gets a table in the bar, will have to pay full price during HH. There are many other options in the area - Tres Tempe, TPM, Good Times Charli's - that do offer HH to all patrons so unless Hop Social changes their  policies, will not be going there again.",

In fact our servers have all been pretty excellent. The owners stop by the tables to see how everything, which is pretty classy.   I would agree that it's loud inside, but we sit outside. The happy hour menu is pretty good I'd say having had the steak bites chicken tenders, corn fritters, and donuts. Last night we split the meatloaf and it was pretty bomb, I mean the thing is wrapped in bacon.  Beer selection is excellent with the Rogue Cold Brew IPA being my favorite.   I'm searching for something to knock them for but I got nothing. I think people just need to give them a chance to hit their stride.  I'm hoping they do well especially with the ruining the remodel at Whole Foods has done with their bar and smoke house.",

Transitioning to dinner was nice and there are plenty of great entrees to choose from.  One thing I pay attention to is the service and we were routinely checked in on by our server and the floor manager.  Everyone in our party felt like the customer service was outstanding and the food and drinks met the challenge. We will definitely be back to sample other drinks and food items.  This is a place that is good for small groups or large groups. Great for appetizers or full meals.  It nice to have a place so close by to have a good night out any day of the week.  Atmosphere is good and the volume level is perfect to have a nice conversation with the table without having to yell. Will be my go to place for sure!!",

I went with a friend on Father's Day and was told the wait would be 25 min waited about 10 min and was seated, so i thought i was in for a good time. So our waitress comes over and asks what we would like to drink we got water initially because we were still looking at the drink menu. I kid you not the waitress, Ariel, was serving a table right behind us with 8 people, and she didn't take our drink orders for another 20 min. Once i finally got her attention she asked what we wanted. My friend ordered a 16 oz beer and i sprang for the larger size while advising the waitress I'm not sure when I'll see you again so I'll take the larger size. The waitress immediately got defensive rolled her eyes and said i said sorry like 20 thousand times. So i proceeded to ask for a manager. The manager comes over and offers us a comped appetizer. We refused the food and finished our beers hesitantly hoping our drinks were not tampered with. It's safe to say i will never be back again!!",

When we first arrived we were greeted by a hostess who was kind and let us know happy hour was in the bar area only. When we got up to the bar, it was packed! One of the only tables open inside was dirty, so my fiance kindly asked a waitress (standing right next to us) if they could have it cleaned.. mind you she was busy, so he even acknowledged the fact she was busy and asked once she finished if she could please ask someone to clean the table. The waitress looked at him and didn't even say a word and turned back around. Like really? We were kinda shocked that she literally worked there and didn't have the decency to say a word. Someone ended up cleaning our table right after and we ate our food. We didn't get water refilled or barely checked on. I just wish our first experience was better because we would've returned, we love places like this! But the customer services sucks! Manager didn't care either when we made him aware of the situation, after we finished, paid and we're about to leave. Didn't bother to ask who we were referring to either.",

My husband and I put in a food order and never received any food after waiting a hour and a half.  Tonight we went again to give it another try.  We were seated right away and then waited for 15 minutes to get water because the hosted seated us in a place that wasn't covered by wait staff.  We put in a food order and waited, and waited and waited.  My husband and child's food was sitting under a warmer for 20 minutes before it came out, because my pizza took so long.  The kung pow chicken was cold, blah and was some chicken and rice.  Thats it.  I ordered the forest mushroom pizza...and it came out with no mushrooms!!!  When we finally were able to tell a manager, they put in a new order and comped both pizzas.  But really, too little, too late.  We will not be giving Hop Social a third chance and I'm really bummed by that.",

Poor waitress when she told the manager we watched him smell it and nod. Sent her back to tell us they won't charge us for it! REALLY!? You served a customer bad fish and the manager doesn't even come over to apologize. No offer to get us something else (which we would have declined as now all I can think about is the night ahead with food poisoning). Nothing we had was worth the trip. The poke tuna appetizer was a huge mound of rice with a little ahi (in retrospect probably a blessing knowing the quality of fish). It came with a small over cooked piece of wonton when we asked for more the waitress came back with two little broken pieces and said \"if you need the cook can make some fresh ones\" REALLY why would you not start with fresh ones!?  The menu is all over the place from wood fire pizzas, stir fry, tacos, burgers, steaks, pastas pot pie and meatloaf it makes no sense.  Figure out what you do well (not the fish obviously) but quality and do it right. This place will never last! Don't waste your time go to Maerles or Firebird next door, you won't get food poisoning.",

In haven't been here before  wanted to know about some items too much in hurry or just didn't care say a little of both. Ordered the blackened chicken pasta friend had roast beef sandwich. The blackened chicken was way way too spicy overwhelming plan pasta no feta a couple leafs of spinach a bad dish. I let the server know when we could find her asked another server for ketchup that didn't happen I asked that server again she was to busy now running food, but we have semi hot food now, OMG really. Are server came finally came over told her about the over spiced chicken not good wanted to order something else ask about fish tacos she told me has some spice I didn't want any. Came out the same way as the chicken spice couldn't believe it didn't eat, such a waste of time & money. We weren't the only ones saying the same, ya think they would fixed.  First time and last time will go here. Staff with no care, friendly attitude. No Thanks",

First of all, the wait time to get our food was borderline absurd considering the restaurant was far from busy. It took about 20 minutes for a starter salad and about 40 minutes for a salad and burger. The side for the burger was delayed too. One of the items came out wrong and while we kept it anyways (we were super hungry after the long wait) there was no offer to remake or a discount on our check. As someone who comes from the restaurant industry, that was disappointing. Contrary to other posts though, I did think the food was good. And the staff was nice.",

First of all, it's really loud. Even after the noise dampeners it's still difficult to hear the people at your table. Secondly, it's freezing in this place. Second visit and still ridiculously cold.   The food overall is pretty tasty. The corn fritters were dry and the sauce is way too sweet. We've been twice and had the orange chicken (pretty solid, small portion for the cost), chicken sandwich (pass - it's nothing to write home about and mine was incredibly salty), the Mac and cheese (probably the best thing we had here period. Would recommend), and the steak salad (pretty good but borderline salty again and difficult to eat).   The servers, while nice, are not attentive enough. Additionally, my biggest complaints are the fact that all the food came out together - the cup of soup, appetizer and all the entrees. Huge pet peeve of mine. When our entrees came out, my steak salad was ice cold and had clearly been sitting for a WHILE. The restaurant remade it warm but no apology was made and no alteration to the bill. My husband was done with his pasta before my remade meal even arrived.   Overall, I think it's still a work in progress. Potential but I'd like to see a lot of these things change before coming back - especially for the price point.",

I don't live in the area, but I had this place bookmarked so I decided to take a drive and check it out.  I'm glad I did.  I would and probably will return.",

We were seated near the kitchen, so got to see the magic happening.  I personally am not a fan of the high top tables as my legs dangled and went numb, but there are several other seating options available that we will choose next time.  The staff is very lively and energetic, constantly in motion.  The greatest experience was meeting, and being welcomed by the owners, David and Christie.  They talked to us for quite some time and we were very impressed with them.  The food was absolutely delicious and was served quickly.  My husband had the meatloaf and I had a cheeseburger.  It was awesome being remembered as we left, Christie shook our hands again and called us by name.  It was definitely a very enjoyable experience and we will be back!",

My waitress was Amazing ( Halona ) she was on top of it, with suggestions to all of my questions. Also , she saw my pizza wasn't exactly what it should be she got the manager to address it immediately.  Fist, my pizza was the heirloom margarita pizza , but as you'll see in the pic it had whole cherry tomatoes on it cut in Half. I found out later they were out. The manager did remove it from the bill so , I appreciate that. Other than that I would not get the pizza again.  My daughter got the Grilled Chicken sandwich , she said it was amazing !  Last but not least was the appetizer, we got the pretzels and cheese to start ( yes was a carb overload day,lol )  They were so good , they were soft and they didn't skimp on the cheese. For once I had extra cheese when I finished!",

The steak bits were definitely hands down my favorite dish. Very tasty and cooked perfectly. I would recommend you not to modify your preference on the temp of the steak. For someone who doesn't eat steak due to braces it was tender soft juicy and melted in my mouth that's how amazing that dish was. If you like sushi it was very delicious. The service was great as well are waiter I believe his name was Trevor checked up on us but made sure we were taken care of. The rest of the staff was fantastic from the hostess opening the door and the servers pre bussing are table. I believe a manager stopping to check on us as well.

Alot of the food has a spicy kick to it.  Food portions are pretty good sized and reasonably priced.  Some dishes were too much and had a nice portion of left overs....Not a bad problem to have. The happy hour has a great selection of drinks and food; at reasonable prices. It can get quite busy, crazy, and loud during happy hour. Friends could barely hear each other talk. It's a pretty good sized restaurant. I've had a number of food items from the main menu and almost everything on the happy hour menu. There hasn't been anything I didn't like. I'll be returning.",

We ordered a Wedge salad - Cold, crispy, oh so satisfying!  !And! The Buttermilk Battered Crispy Fried Chicken Sandwich.  Note of caution - The menu cites the following ingredients: country gravy, lettuce, tomato, onion, ciabatta bun; BUT! they also add some sort of Mayo concoction... and Mr. P don't do the Liquid Chicken. They made me another one. So happy.   The sandwich was fantastic. It's so good it's gonna be a struggle not to order it again every visit.

We came here before going to a concert for our friends birthday and all the staff at the restaurant signed a card for her! They also fixed this AWESOME ice cream sundae that was just so yummy that even though we were full from dinner, we made room, lol!!   I have already recommended this place to people and I will continue to tell everyone about it! Keep up the great work!!!",

First off, SHOUT OUT to Angel for being the most attentive and amazing bartender during my visit! Not only was I able to have a great business meeting and go over some great opportunities, I was also praised for picking such an amazing spot with great atmosphere to conduct a successful connection. Thank you to Angel for the great service, warm smile, and wonderful humor to make this a great experience. I will highly recommend this spot for any occasion to enjoy good food and great environment.",

On a Monday night the crowd was thin at 8:30 but the place didn't seem at all dead, very nice atmosphere.  The bartender, Angel, made a great beer recommendation right away so I asked for a dinner recommendation.  Without hesitation she said the Cabernet Tenderloin Tips.  She wasn't wrong.  After dinner she set me up with some house made infused whiskey that was pretty damn good.  Go check out Angel, she won't steer you wrong.",

The first time I came here, our server took orders one at a time. She literally came up to our table, took one of our orders and walked away. Didn't even ask if anyone else needed anything or checked in on us very often. You know when you try to get someones attention before they walk away, but they completely fail to acknowledge you? Yea, that was us every single time she stopped at our table haha.   They have 52 beers on tap, a lot of local brews. Which is pretty neat. You get $1 off draft pints during HH. The steak bites were pretty good. & the spicy mac & cheese was very good as well. Does have a huge kick to it for those who like spicy food. If you cant  Handle too much spice, I wouldn't recommend ordering this dish. Donuts are awesome as well. They taste very similar to churro but more doughy haha. It comes with caramel on the side but they are still just as good if you eat them by itself. & who could forget about the prices during HH, they are awesome. Just wished the service was just as good as the food and drinks.",

Disappointing considering it is a beer place. Grilled steak salad with Brussels sprouts was good, pizza was not. The Italian sausage pizza was loaded with green and black olives making it very salty and there was nothing special about the crust. Glad to see the crowd. Great prices for happy hour but you must sit in the bar.  Second trip and loved the veggie burger. So unique with black beans, beets and sauteed poblano! Lots of flavor and the texture was good, and because of the beets it was a beautiful red. Also the buttermilk fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy was fantastic, crispy juicy and tender. The donuts might be my favorite item on the menu, perfect amount of cinnamon and powdered sugar but the caramel sauce was perfection!! Do not resist the urge to indulge, it was worth every calorie bite!",

As for the food, it was pretty good! Not to sound cheap, but it seemed to be a tad bit expensive but the food was good. I had the steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Definitely something that I would recommend! They also had a nice selection of alcohol.  Lastly, when they found out that it was my birthday, they gave me a banana split and a nice card signed by the entire staff (and thankfully they didn't sing).

Make your food the reason customer wants to come back!  I suggest the franchise to check out it's competitors nearby(places I would consider going before Hop Social) - Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen in Chandler. Equally beautify decorated but the food is good and cost much less on drinks.  - Wildflower Bread Company inside of Chandler mall. Great sandwich and salad options! Fraction of the price. Your competition to lunch crowd. - Meridiem Kitchen & Lounge. Very nice environment. Great for business meeting and social events! - And tones of other restaurants in chandler downtown.",

I ordered the buttermilk chicken salad which came dressed with a raspberry vinaigrette - and when I asked about the dressing choice people didn't really seem to know what was printed on the menu. Not only that the cucumbers were soggy and looked like they had been frozen and the salad hadn't even been picked through for bad or off looking pieces. You can tell when someone in the kitchen doesn't really care what kind of food they're putting out and that's what it looked like from our perspective.   The manager came by to check- her question to me at the table wasn't the best. \"I heard your salad came out with the wrong dressing\" :-/ I was thoroughly unhappy but didn't want to make a big deal about it, I tried to eat it but, it just wasn't good with that raspberry dressing. I thought the manager would comp the salad as a whole seeing as how it was the kitchens fault that it came out wrong but decided to charge me for the chicken. I think she should have just taken it off completely.",

There's like 50+ beers on tap, a ton of them are local too which is great (and real local, not Four Peaks' fake ass version of local) and so if you're just drinking then this place is probably more like a 4 star.  But their food is kinda iffy.  The steak bites are...ok.  It's just steak and balsamic with too much steak seasoning but it isn't bad for the price.  Don't order the artichoke dip though, christ.  It was like greenish Elmer's Glue.    Some other reviewer said the meals aren't great and while I didn't order much else in the way of food, the stuff that I saw I tend to agree didn't look great.  I hate the fact that I'm agreeing with that reviewer though because they started off by saying \"I'm a foodie\" which might as well be the same as saying \"I'm a bland and boring piece of crap who thinks the fact that I eat food makes me special\".  Seriously, stop calling yourselves foodies, people, you look like assholes.  Anyway, this place has the potential to be pretty good but that menu has to get better.

They other bartender wanted to make another since she jokingly bragged \"hers was better\".  It was a fun way of getting us to order another martini. Everyone was cool.  Great remodel of the former restaurant.   Great local and not-so local craft beer line up.    If the prices of beer were a bit better, I would go back more often.  Sounds weird, but on the app menu, not for dessert, you must order the donuts.  Perfect with a beer!",

We arrived and as Angel went to grab our drinks without having to order as usual she said hang on I don't have a happy hour red up here. She went and talked to the blonde manager and asked if she can serve us a different wine since they were out. The manager said no so angel asked if we bought a bottle of the next cheapest wine could she sell it to us for the HH price, again right in front of us the manager said no. She looked at us and said sorry guys we just don't have it tonight. If it wasn't for Angel and Levi we would have gotten up and left. I get that you run out of stuff but when a exception can be made in this industry you make it. All night the servers were coming to the bar asking why they couldn't serve something else and they had to go back to their tables and tell them no. We will always be back because of the service we receive but dissatisfied with the manager tonight. We are not cheap just HH is HH and when you come to a bar because of their happy hour you expect it.",

I ordered the stuffed salmon and my husband ordered the Cabernet tenderloin tips. Everything was really good and flavorful. The tenderloin was so tender and perfect.   The customer service was really good. The manager came over to ask me about the drink that I wanted and how it was. We'll definitely be back to try some other items.",

(They asked the table across from me numerous times if they had been served, and that table looked annoyed at the excessive attention while I received little to none.   It took more than 15 minutes from the time I placed my drink order for it to arrive, and I had to wait another 15 minutes after my drink was haphazardly slid across the bar to me (and she spilled a significant amount of it) to be able to place my food order. The drink was also incredibly sweet yet also watered down. Think watery juice with extra sugar.   Also had to cancel my food order (a salad) after waiting nearly an hour for it to hit the table from the time I ordered.   Definitely not a place to grab a quick bite, even when they aren't busy.   Service staff was rude and many seemed like they were new to waitressing/hosting entirely. Altogether, a terrible experience. I will not return.",

We almost narrowed down to cucumber but couldn't be sure! - they were kind enough to omit from bill. Blackened chicken with pasta - good and spicy a hit.  But when you order plain pasta just know it's plain and aldente where you can tie bows for fun! Guess I was schooled to orders minus the veg! Blackened Caesar salad  - God I messed up and I guess forgot to mention his time....I think...... - offered to pay my mistake but they remade it to go.  Note to self NEVER get hot chicken on top of a cold salad and take it home.  Came home and it was soup.  Gross Off the menu (grid) garlic cheese bread! .....whatever happens to garlic or cheese bread with a garlic salad lol! - we'll see picture I got sort of cheese bread!  But oh well!

It was a delicious dish of mac & cheese but it wasn't spicy at all. No biggie though because while misleading, it was still a solid dish. I don't need my culo to burn to enjoy my food. I also nabbed a few bites of the Thai Prawn Linguini. That peanut sauce was tasty! I also stole a bite of my friend's Chicken Pot Pie and goodness... it was dang good! Our waitress had told us that it was the owner's mother's recipe. *kisses fingertips* We were also told about how their fried chicken is soaked in buttermilk for hours and other tidbits of facts about their menu.  Service was great. I enjoyed parking my spin class abused bum on the squishy booths and the ambiance was just right.

    "text": "I wish it was closer to downtown Scottsdale.  Overall great food, drinks and service.  It does have the same type of feeling as other gastropubs.  It's in standalone building in the Chandler Mall complex. Lots of parking.  If the hostess isn't busy she even opens the front door for you. What a nice touch.  Came here for Arizona Restaurant Week with several friends.  The artichoke, spinach and cheese dip was so good my friend was quivering with delight.  The calamari had a nice crispy coating with a excellent aioli that had just the right amount of heat.  We also got the homemade donuts which wasn't on the Arizona Restaurant Week menu.   The donuts were great. In fact I make similar donuts at home. Who doesn't love fresh deep fried donuts?   Everyone had the stuffed salmon.  It was good, but the crab and shrimp stuffing gets lost in the salmon.  Also the accompanying asparagus was overcooked or old.  It was shriveled, but still tasty.     The atmosphere is casual and a little noisy as the hard floor and ceiling bounce the noise around.  Service was excellent.  I still love them opening the doors as I came in and left. lol",

    "text": "So many issues with our first visit here and I had this place book marked since it opened.   My husband was very disappointed to learn that the chicken pot pie was not available. The bartender/server told us that more were being made but it would be an hour or so before they were ready. He decided on a salad so we could get our order in quickly.  I ordered a ROASTED BEET SALAD with citrus, spinach, chicken, and candied walnuts, with the mustard dressing on the side. My husband ordered ordered the strawberry, pear, feta salad with arugula. What we got did not match the menu description. The salads should have been named, ARUGULA salad with strawberries, etc. and mine, SPINACH salad with beets. My salad had about 3 slices of 1inch long beets, about 3 ounces of chicken and a pile of spinach. I was really looking forward to the roasted beets which are one of my favorites. To top it off, our order took more than 20 minutes. It's a salad...what was the hold up? It wasn't that busy by that time. I had to ask our server to check on our order, which she swiftly brought out and said our order \"happened to be ready\" right when she asked. I have a feeling that she forgot about it and swooped in to pick them up.  In addition, she neglected to bring my dressing.   The problem I believe was that this is a holiday and many folks were off work and the restaurant was understaffed. I feel sorry for the bartender who had to act as server too. How in the world could she stay on top of things as she worked the bar. She was very sweet and did the best she could.   It's really disappointing to spend $13 on a plate load of spinach and not be remotely satisfied or at least not be hungry. We decided a second lunch was in order and had to hold back to not head to In 'n Out which I desperately needed.  Last, the added bonus is that I got walnut shells in my salad that almost broke a tooth. I'd post a photo, but it's kinda gross.   Sorry HST, we won't be back.",

The reason as to why I did not give a full 5 stars is because we made a reservation and we came in with a party of four when they went to seat us she took us to a table that was fairly small that only had two chairs at it. The hostess just had us crowed around the table while they found us extra chairs (which seemed very difficult to them) we ended up asking if we could switch tables because it was a small table and because we didn't want to stand around and wait for our chairs.   Other than the issue with the chairs, our waitress was amazing came back multiple times to ask if we needed any drinks. She recommended a lot of different types of foods that were popular which was nice as well. The food came out fairly quickly for how busy it was. I would definitely recommend to make a reservation before coming in since it is busy all of the time. I thought all of the ladies that worked there were extremely nice and helpful, again besides the issue we had with the original table.",

Our entrees, a dinner salad and a pizza, came out first  so we had to ask the food runner about our original side salad and cup of soup which they said they would go grab. By the time my salad came I had already grubbed out on a slice of pizza. what's even the point of having the salad? We asked about why our food came out backwards and the server said \"the kitchen just does whatever they want.\" Okay, nice. I feel more comfortable after that answer. Yeah, no.   I only came here because my mom wanted to come here. I honestly would have rather spent a cool $60 somewhere else.   2/10 would not recommend.  The place looks nice but the service could be way better. Food is decent. Pizza wasn't a total waste. Salads were actually really good. My mom said her drink got poured with a heavy hand so you win some and you lose some. Maybe if I drank I wouldn't have been so bummed out about the service. Not sure though and I won't be coming back to find out. ",

My honest opinion is it's not the servers, it's management. Based on our observations, it seems to be poorly run. Which is sad, because the atmosphere is great. The food is just ok. My husband really liked the fried chicken. Other things we have tried: -calamari, menu says it's hand cut, it doesn't taste fresh at all, and is overbreaded -hamburger, tasted like a skinny frozen patty -asparagus, all 3 times over cooked  -coleslaw, really good -fish and chips, fish was good but overbreaded and really greasy so couldn't finish it -chicken fingers, good After 3 tries, we won't be back :(  BUT- if you're looking for place to just go sit at the bar and have a good beer, this is the place!",

We had a nice selection to choose from (food and drinks).  I had the taco fish happy hour for $5.95. My husband had the Chicken and fries, our friend had the steak with salad. Taco was super good and portions were huge. Flavor wise it was spot on.  My husband picked chicken and Gallo, and praised it.  Our friend like the steak slices but would have preferred the Chicken when he saw it on our table. All appetizers were priced around $5 or less. My taco fish  (2) were big and soooo good!  When compared with Sand Bar, from this point on, l'd rather go to Hop Social anytime!  Food and beverages tasted better, prices were a lot lower for what we got. Also even though it got really busy, we could still have a conversation, they don't overload you with sounds. We will be back soon!",

He made sure we were comfortable and satisfied. One point of improvement I would suggest is to make sure he knows that you do have hot drinks as well. Nothing on the mnThe manager came around multiple times as well.  One thing I should have counted on with a venue like this was how noisy it was. But the noise level was such that it could have made it impossible for the waiter or cook to hear medium well as opposed to medium rare for my steak.   Speaking of my steak. Sorry Firebirds! This ribeye dwarfed yours.  This was nearly a plate-sized ribeye. It was definitely quite tasty and gives Firebirds a run for their money.  For an appetizer, we had the corn fritters which we tore up faster than a school of piranha on a carcass. They had the right combination of texture and flavor. The honey sauce was excellent. It is sourced locally but has the same taste and texture as Manuka honey.  Overall, the experience was pleasant and we will return.  My wife had the chicken tender salad and was quite happy. The tenders looked quite good and the portions were large enough for her to eat the next day.",

We sat on the outdoor patio (open seating) at 2pm on a Sunday - it was not busy. About 1/3 of the tables had people at them.   Menu: great list of items and excellent beer list!  Service: unbelievably slow!!! Order for drinks and apps went in in good time. 15 minutes later we had to flag down our waiter and tell him we wanted to place an order for food. All drinks seemed to fly out quickly. Unfortunately our beer flight had beer spilled in all the holes - sloppy. Our appetizer (spinach dip and chips) came 30 minutes later which was a little slow but ok.    The poor part was that we didn't get our food (hamburger and salad) until 3pm. Our waiter came and said \"I don't know what's going on with the kitchen\". No apology, no comped drinks or app. I was disappointed. Our waiter came outside only once ever 15 minutes which meant no water refills. I do have to say it looked like the waiter was working his tail off inside, just didn't pay as much attention to his 2 outside tables. He gave us the bill and within 1 minute we put the credit card on it. It wasn't picked up for 15 minutes (no joke, I timed it).   Price: overpriced. My salad was $14 and to be honest the two small pieces of breaded chicken were cold.  The salad itself was arugula dressed with a nice dressing (although the blackberry seeds  can feel like their nearly break your teeth) and sprinkled with cheese with 2 black berries. To me this salad was barely worth $10. To top it off, it cost the same as my husbands burger and fries.",

Recommend Saturday evenings to make reservations otherwise 45 min wait.. Waitress Erika was very friendly and professional. Made our visit delightful. Atmosphere was very unique. Booths, high tops, low tops, couchs and chairs, bar seating , regular dining tables, outside patio seating. Decor was excellent. Open kitchen to dining area is immaculate.  We had a grilled chicken sandwich and a meatloaf dinner. The bill was a reasobable $30. Chicken was tender and bun roll it came on was delicious. The meatloaf was exceptional with garlic mashed potatoes and cooked carrots topped with onion strings. All very tasty. We were impressed with the complete experience. A definite return in the future..  thumbs up !!!!!",

    "text": "I stay in this area for business quite frequently. I usually go to Firebird. My wife and I came to visit family and I thought I would take her to Firebird. We drove in from Vegas and were very hungry. Firebirds had a 30-40 minute wait, so we decided to walk next door to Hop Social Tavern. Expectations weren't that high thinking it was just another tavern.  Was pleasantly surprised when we walked in. It has a great layout and was decorated very nicely. They said it would be about a 15 minute wait, so we decided to stay. Glad we did! About 5 minutes later, the seated us.   They have large selection of beers, most being local. I asked our waitress, Ariel for her recommendations and she was very helpful.   We decided to start with the pretzels. They are probably the best I have ever had. Could be shared by 4 people, but were so good, my wife and I almost finished them.  My wife ordered the fish and chips. Although not the best she has ever had, she was very happy with them. She could not eat even half of it. Their portions are fairly large.  I went with Ariel's recommendation of the spicy Mac & cheese. Wow! It was awesome. The perfect balance of flavor and heat. Again, maybe the best I've had. Portion was also so big, I could only finish a little over half.  We finished with their desert doughnuts that was also recommended. Very good.  I will definitely eat here again and look forward trying different items on the menu. Our table was actually close to the open kitchen and we saw many of the dishes that were being served. They all looked good, especially the pot pie and burgers.   I just wish we had one in Vegas!",

Our server - Ruger - was MIA all night. He came back once to ask if we wanted more drinks...which was about 45 minutes into our dinner. Took our orders and then disappeared. Someone else brought out our food, put it on the table, and walked away. We had no silverware to eat with. Took us another 5 minutes to flag someone down so we could actually begin eating our meal. My sandwich order, which is not a difficult dish, was missing the bacon, and ordered no mustard, which was abundantly spread on my food. It appears no one really cares what the customer orders, nor actually servicing the patrons who are sitting there eating. Sorry to be so harsh, but it was a very disappointing experience having been there for the first time. :-/",

    "text": "Tuesday night around 7pm with a good crowd. Greeted by several hostesses that were smiling and friendly. Our server, Marcus, was very friendly, gave many suggestions and his personal favorites with the brews and food. We got the bacon-wrapped meatloaf and the Cuban pulled pork sandwich. Both meals were excellent and would absolutely order them again! about 40-something beers that are constant and about 5-10 rotating handles of seasonal or specialty brews. Very similar vibe to the Yardhouse locations around the valley. Everything was very clean, our service was great and my IPA was very fresh (local McFate). Nice job, but nothing really stands out as a \"new\" concept, which I'm not sure they are claiming. The food and service spoke for itself, and for that reason I'll happily go back and recommend.",

The only downside is you cannot get happy hour in the whole restaurant.",

My friend enjoyed her gluten-free beer too. We must've had 3 different managers check on us during our visit. We felt cared for and I personally enjoyed my meal immensely. I ordered the Kung pao chicken. My friend had chicken tenders with fries and gravy. I kept stealing hers too. Will definitely be back!",

Tasted like a lean cuisine. Last time it was the Mac & cheese. Just no flavor at all. This time it was the chicken sandwich. It was SO SALTY....we tried picking pieces out to see what was the salt item...I think it was the sauce. Maybe the chicken? Not sure, but I'm done trying. I'm really bummed! The people are super nice! Service is great! Beer menu phenomenal! All moot without good food. Color me sad.",

    "text": "Excellent happy hour! 3-6 and a really nice selection of moderately priced food. The thing I enjoyed most was the selection. Normally, with a happy hour at a bar and grill, you get basic bar food. But their happy hour menu includes full meals...like a cheeseburger for only $5.95.  Came in with a party of 5 for drinks and snacks, and ended up ordering 6 or 7 different appetizers. Everything was good, but I really enjoyed the nachos! You won't be disappointed. Only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 was the prices on the beer. Though they have an impressive selection of beers on tap, only a small number were included in the happy hour specials, and those were still $4.50 (I think). To be honest, I'm not certain how much I paid for the beers I did have, but for a couple appetizers and a few beers, I didn't feel like I got an amazing deal. The good news is, the food was all really good, the beer was COLD, which I appreciate, the decor was nice. All in all, a great new place. Will definitely be back!",

Food was good, but nothing that jumped out as \"I gotta go back and have that again!\".   My two complaints were 1) the seating set-up outside - it felt really cramped. We had a table with one side against the outside wall (with a bench) and the other side with a chair, towards the walkway. Every time the server for the table behind us would walk by... my chair was bumped. I couldn't possibly move it in any closer to the table. And 2) the happy hour beer selection was really confusing - there was no list. The happy hour menu just says \"select craft beers\". When asked for a listing, I swear that the two different servers told us different beers (they changed shift while we were there). Would be nice to have them listed!   But, on the plus side... the food was good. The service was good.",

We remained friendly through all of this because we'd had an otherwise awesome day. Our steaks were basic and not cooked properly. But the craziest part of dinner was the manager coming over and embarrassing my date when she ordered a porter for desert. My date had had only two beers, and the request for the porter provoked an embarrassing and pretentious response from the manager as she scolded us loudly for violating their 4 drink maximum rule. I tried over and over to explain that we hadn't \"violated\" the rule to begin with, but the she wasn't actively listening. Terrible place, terrible employees, and basic food.",

From the beer selection decor to the sweet modern couches. The look overall is great.   Its right by the mall, which is a great location. I think this place will do well because of that alone.   I ordered a burger. My friends ordered Chicken Marsala and Fish Tacos. Everyone seems to think their food was Ok. I don't think it was FANTASTIC, but I may have just ordered the wrong them for my liking.   Customer service was great. Everyone seemed genuinely nice and happy to be there. There is a pretty sweet bar area, which I thought looked cool as well.   I hear that the desert here is awesome. For that reason alone, I'll probably be back to try this place again. I may even order something different and try and get this place up to 4 or 5 stars!

First off, we were greeted with a warm welcome at the door when we arrived and our table of five was immediately seated. The dining area is quite spacious with interesting couch-like seating in one area and counter-height booths in another. We tried the donut appetizer and OMG...so good! Don't be scared away by the reference to ricotta cheese, which sounds like an odd ingredient addition to a donut. They really are wonderful and frankly were probably the best part of the meal! The food was good but it I'd say it wasn't anything special (the donuts were special). The pastrami on the pretzel roll could have been but it needed some seasoning/some flavor. My hubby said the same about the meatloaf - just needed some seasoning. Our waitress was quite friendly, attentive, and efficient. All in all a good experience. We'd certainly give them another try.",

My \"Cuban\" was amazingly delicious. I almost forgave the place for the hot dining area because it was so good. The other two in my party both had French dip that they both highly appreciated . . .

The slow service wasn't appreciated by the three of us that would normally have had two or three times as many cocktails if they had been coming faster or if it were more comfortable in there.

We loved the Elephant Bar when it was in this location and wanted to give the new restaurant a try.  The interior has been converted  to a very open concept.  It's nice.  There are lots of high bar seats, some lower tables and booths.  There's a very modern feel.  I wasn't real pleased with the menu.  I'm not sure what we were looking for but had a little trouble ordering for a late lunch because I didn't feel we had good options.  We didn't want a hamburger and didn't want a steak.  We ended up with a pepperoni pizza.  The 12\", 6 slice pizza was $14.99 and had a total of 7 pieces of pepperoni.  The pizza was very good and had lots of cheese.  Seasoning was good but it was more like a cheese pizza than a pepperoni one.  We felt the restaurant was quite expensive for what it offered.  Service was good.",

First I have to talk about the customer service, it was fantastic. So Tenley was our server she was so friendly and attentive, our drinks and food came to our table so fast.  Our dinner entrees came out before our appetizer,  Tenley profusely apologized, the manager brought out our appetizer and apologized, it was comped by the manager, the tiny booboo was handled so professionally I didn't feel slighted in the least. Actually it worked out to my benefit, I took my pretzel dipped it in beer cheese then dipped it in my Chicken Pot Pie, dipped in beer cheese dipped in meatloaf, dipped in beer cheese dipped in mash potatoes, dipped in beer cheese dipped in Mojito, just kidding but I did a lot of double dipping. YUMMMM   Beer selection was huge I took sips of several but ended up with some traditional but equally well made tasty mojitos.   I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie which came out so hot, and tasted great just like moms. The meatloaf and mash potatoes were delicious and also tasted great just like moms. OH! And last but not least DONUT BALLS with Carmel Sauce! Crunchy crispy sweet cinnamony little nummies, not like moms she didn't let us eat donuts.",

I stopped by for dinner with some friends and decided to get there just before happy hour ended to grab a drink before dinner.  Still, they have 40+ beers on tap, still only a handful are on happy hour, still the bartender isn't really sure which ones, and for the 2nd trip in a row, I received a different beer than what I ordered.  I can't recall this happening to me anywhere else and it's happened here twice.  2-stars for the bar.  Onward to dinner...  Needless to say with my happy hour experience I wasn't going into dinner with super high expectations.  That said, the service was excellent and attentive (she even got the drink's right!) and the food was quite good.  I went with the Cuban which was great.  It had lots of shaved ham and pulled pork and was very ample in size.  The fried chicken was also good. It's enough to feed two people if you're looking to split a dish.  It's two large chicken cutlets fried with mashed potatoes.  Additionally the donuts for dessert were a good way to end the meal.  The atmosphere on a Friday night was great and the 45 minute wait we were quoted seemed to go quickly.  For dinner, I'll be back.  For happy hour...well, we've covered that.",

    "text": "Despite the beautiful dining area and the wonderful first impression, the service, food, and treatment I received on my first time at this establishment was very much sub par. After ordering, the server accidentally gave us the food from the table next door which they immediately corrected, apologized, and offered them soup or salad as they wait for a fresh plate of what they ordered. Noticing this interaction in comparison to the treatment we later received made this entire experience much more disappointing. Our calamari appetizer came late, at the same time as our entrees, and lukewarm. In addition, my parents both ordered fish and chips which was mistaken for fish tacos by the server. Instead of immediately correcting the mistake, the server awkwardly took the food away and went back to check if that was in fact what we ordered and what he wrote down. He eventually returned and said the food would be coming soon with no apology or concern, as if we were the ones at fault for the mistake. A huge contrast compared to the service of the next door table. I'm not sure if it was due to the fact that these next door guests were predominately white males while our table was predominately females in which case they potentially did not feel the need to address our issues with the same promptness or kindness or our server was inexperienced (although the server was exactly the same for both tables, so he may just have issues treating guests consistently or equally). Food came around 20 minutes later after half the guests finished their meals. Overall the food was rather salty except for the mashed potatoes (despite the service I admit that these were well made). The hostess eventually came around to make a very brief apology, which left us feeling more confused and dissatisfied because it did not seem that they appreciated our patronage as new customers. After we received the check the server finally addressed the problem and asked if we wanted donuts on the house for the mess up. At this point we were so fed up with the food and service that we graciously declined to continue this experience. I left this distasteful place feeling as though I had done something to wrong them and not the other way around. My apologies for not ordering what you had wanted me to and inconveniencing you. On a different note, thank you for ruining my mother's birthday.",

The sandwich was very tasty and the bread fresh. It had a nice kick so it's a good thing I asked for no jalapenos. We were never asked if we wanted dessert so I didn't try anything.

The staff and management seem to work well together and together they offer a great experience to the customer.",

    "text": "To the management - The front of house hosts do not know how to do their job. They have one person that stays up front and another that takes you to the table. We had reservations at 6:45pm and as we waited for our table for 10 minutes, we observed the chaos. Groups of people came in and they started to tell people it was an hour wait and then they started to say it was 1.5 hour wait.  I saw them turn away several people.  When we finally sat down, we noticed several tables open up so the groups of people that just came in were able to sit down right away. The one gal that seats guests should observe what tables are opening up and communicate that to the front host. I've never seen a dysfunctional operation as this restaurant. So the takeaway is, it's all about timing. If you come in and they say it's an hour wait, just wait, it's not an hour. They have no idea what they are doing. Or come back in 10 min and they will give you a different waiting time. Food is pretty good though so definitely go in and they have a good list of craft beers.",

He forgot our waters and didn't bring them out til we almost left, and we asked for ranch for our fries and they brought out some sort of horse radish sauce which tasted NOTHING like ranch but really besides all that, this place was great.

Staffed by millenials that conduct themselves like doormen at a night club...you are greeted by a daddy's little rich girl, who daddy put in charge of his restaurant, and the princess hired all of her condescending club rat friends. All the Californians and/or New Yorkers will relate to this restaurants business model...Although the place has numerous open tables and is half empty, you will be not seated, but instead you will be directed to the bar. In other words...the place is short staffed because no one wants to work there and there is a 1,000% margin in alcohol and you only need one bartender. The food...how can I put this...lets just say that Chef Gordon Ramsey would close the place down, sent everyone home, and start yelling swear laced insults at the cooking staff.",

I have never seen a lazier, more disinterested bartender than the young man serving me tonight. Luckily, he had a female co-worker that was easily handling 90+% of the work, including serving most of the guests at the bar and handling all of the drinks from the restaurants. She did it all with a smile and great spirits. I wish that I got her name--long black hair. The male bartender has been working here for awhile (surprisingly). I've had his lack of service before. It's not just that he is lazy, he is completely disinterested. He points at you to take an order. You need to yell out everything you want all at once or he'll disappear and you may get your drink, but not your food. Hop needs to rid themselves of this disinterested problem at your bar or you may lose the great bartender that has to make up for him. Several of us at the bar were discussing the obvious disparity in their workload. This would be a 4-5 star review without this service problem.",

The owners are so nice and truly care about every customer walking through the door. The food is also very good. The pretzels and cheese and the donuts are to die for. Also, the chicken pot pie is the best i have ever had. This place is definitely a new go-to!!!",
