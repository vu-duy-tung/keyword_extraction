    "text": "First the food is good, overpriced but good. The thing about this place is that it is beyond poorly managed. You have kids running the place. People overflowing into the street at times because of no parking space. Only guys working it seems are the valets and the slow A** cooks. So as we all stand with infant children to be seated there are 3 booths open but reserved. WHAT? for 25 minutes we stand and and these booths are empty? The 2 girls seating people are maybe 16 and have no idea what is happening. No name tags,no uniforms. a customer has no idea they even work at this place. Then when finally seated they can't get us a high chair because the 2 available have broken safety straps, can you say LAWSUIT! All the other high chairs are being used because they have to use two at a time to boost the chair high enough so the baby can almost reach the tables which are all to high. All the waiting staff is comprised of kids who have no idea about anything you ask. And another thing. Happy Hour is available if you stay on the other side of the restaurant which is standing room only. Who ever heard of such a thing? Yes this is the Arcadia Tavern and yes we have a  Happy Hour but your 10 feet to far over in the restaurant. This was my 4th and LAST time in this place. Food is good but no need to stroke-out because the idiot running the place has no idea how to treat people!",

    "text": "I agree with the above comment. I live in the neighborhood as well and was very excited to see Arcadia Tavern open, hoping it would still have the neighborhood charm of Western Pizza and Red Tomato. I was wowed by the size of the place and the number of flat screens, but unfortunately the food and service were so so. I've tried to go back several times but each time the parking lot is packed and there's no space at the adjacent lots. Who exactly is filling up these spaces??? The restaurant never looks busy from the outside...Due to the lack of parking at Arcadia I found myself ending up at Blackforest Mill and Jts. Both of which I have found to have great food and great drink prices. So to those who will probably venture to Arcadia Grill like I did and be turned away by lack of parking, head over to one of these bars instead. I think you will be pleasantly surprised by the food and drinks.",

When I ordered a drink, the waitress informs me that Chili's has a better beer (both on tap and in the bottle) selection than they do; I settled for a jameson on the rocks. It was getting later in the afternoon so I browsed their menu and found that Chili's has better pricing for the same pre-frozen-heated-in-a-fryer food. I order some tots and another jameson to tide me over. I was right, the tots were frozen but the Arcadia Tavern had put regular pepper on them to make them fancy.  As I was ending my second drink and eating some ice, I got a very nasty surprise. There was GLASS mixed in with my ice! It cut open my mouth on two different spots and I left the bar with a bleeding mouth.  All the manager offered us was free drink tickets. That was really lame. Bad customer service and poor beer selection and over priced food means we will not be going back.",

It's actually a pretty good place to meet a buddy for a couple beers. But, after numerous visits over several years I can honestly say that Arcadia Tavern is consistently disappointing. The food has always been mediocre at best - maybe a little better than Buffalo Wild Wings or Zipps - the service is always slow & I've also always noticed the staff to be condescendingly rude like they're doing me a favor with their presence. The only reason I've eaten here as many times as I have is that it's close to home but every time I've eaten there I've left feeling disappointed.   This is food and atmosphere for U of A people by U of A people with valet parking...",

Instead of sharing a bunch of appetizers, we decided to order off the \"Light Entrees\" portion of the happy hour menu. There is nothing light about these!

    "text": "Hey Arcadia Tavern, You're so hip and cool that you need to park my car in a spot 20 feet from where I hand you the keys. WRONG.  For some reason there are a few places in Arcadia that force you to valet your car despite being an average place where the food, prices, service, income level of customers, and parking have absolutely no need for it.  This is one of them.  Some of you are probably like: THIS DUDES A CHEAPSKATE, HE JUST DOESN'T WANT TO TIP THEM BLAH BLAH.. WRONG AGAIN. I do fit into a subset of people that are ruining the lives of homeless people everywhere (or likely improving them): I don't carry cash.  So now you're going to make me look like a cheap ass because I can't tip the 18 year old in the dirty polo who spent a whole 5 seconds coasting my car from the point where I got out of it to the parking spot 5 meters ahead.  Yeah that's right fuckers, I'm using the metric systems today. Watch what happens.  Automatic 1-point deduction for that.  I can park my own car believe it or not.  Now, some places that involve themselves with this moronic practice can get that point back later in the day by pushing my boner across the 50% hardness threshold.  NOT ARCADIA TAVERN.  I strolled in around 11am, just tryna cure a hangover with a bloody Mary, and scope this place out a little bit.  I had places to be by Noon so I figured I could get in and out of here with more than enough time. TRIPLE WRONG.  First I'm seated, 15 minutes pass, I order, 15 more minutes pass.    (at this point Yaya better be in the back picking tomatoes and distilling mash for this shit, because I could have been out the door hours ago)  OH WAIT This waitress is over here with her back to me watching TV.  Apparently she doesn't work for tips.  Guess how long it took for the bill to come.  LIGHT YEARS.  Tricked you, light years is a distance. One divided by a light year = the distance the valet had to walk to get my car an hour after arriving at this place.  Not coming back, place is a dump.",

    "text": "I have been to Arcadia Tavern several times. Everytime I have been the food has been extremely good.  First time around I had the Tavern Grilled Cheese with tots. Sandwich was really nothing special, but it was grilled perfectly and the tots crunchy, crispy and not greasy. I will give that meal a C+.  Second time was for Happy Hour with some co-workers. My husband and I only had cocktails but several others ordered food. Service was very slow for drinks and food, she was nice just not on top of it. Food ordered was Spinach & Artichoke dip and Hummus & Pitas and a Tavern Burger. Food was well prepared and presentation was spot on and with a $5-$6 price tag you can't go wrong. As for the cocktails, I think $9-$12 for a martini or margarita during Happy Hour is a little overpriced.  Third time was for lunch @ about 11 on a Friday afternoon. We (4 co-workers and myself) decided to order the Salted Pretzel with Roasted Pepper Cheese...OMG. That warm soft pretzel was amazing. I literally could have eaten both of the pretzels that come with an order and died a happy woman. The cheese sauce was good but it kinda reminded me of chili cheese. For my entree I had the Phoenix Philly with Sweet Tots. The taste was wonderful, the perfect amount of spice. My complaint was the sandwich was dry and could have used a touch more shaved prime rib and a little more cheese would have made up for the dryness. The sweets tots could have been left to fry a touch more for they were not crisp enouch for my liking, but again the taste was great.  Co-workers had burgers, Hangover and Rocky Point. All said they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Waitress was nice and got our order correct. The bus boy was great, we never had a dirty dish and he is the one that actually brought our food, both the pretzel and sandwiches.  My only real complaint about Arcadia Tavern is the womens restroom. Why would you only have 1 stall? And why would you have in next to the kids area? All of those kids line up in front of the door to wait their turn to play the free video games and the door sticks, I kept thinking I was going to knock some kid out everytime I opened the door. It's Happy Hour, with beer and with beer comes...well you know. Which does bring me to another complaint. I know they have a small restaurant area separate from the bar, but come on it's still a bar. People are drinking and with drunk people comes an atmosphere I really don't want my kid in.  Prices for food are competitive and the quality is good, for 5 entrees, a appetizer and non-alcoholic beverages our total was $80.   Get the pretzel for Happy Hour its only $5..so, so worth it!",

    "text": "Amazing find!  They have a huge selection of beers on tap, that are not your typical Budweiser. Also, beers come in Schooners, which just make it more fun to drink.  The bar area can get a little cramped, but if you come to watch the game, you're in luck cause there are flat screens throughout the rest of the tavern's dining area and above the bar that can easily be seen from outside.  I recommend the spinach and artichoke dip, tater tots, steak salad (amazing) and margherita pizza. We have been here multiple times and I can't say anything bad about it!",

    "text": "What can I say about the Arcadia Tavern? well actually quite a bit since it is walking distance from my house. I was a little skeptical because since I have lived in the Arcadia area there have been several different establishments in the Arcadia Tavern building.   i must say when I first walked in I was shocked to see they had taken over the space next door and really opened the bar/restaurant up. It is a great place to watch a game because it's chock full of flat screens, has great beer, and bar menu. I must say that the best thing on the menu are the buffalo chicken sliders. They are a must have. So are the tater tots. Tater tots make me feel like a kid all over again....lol...I also really like the Thursday $3 Dos Equis special served in a goblet. So the good, food, drinks, atmosphere. The bad? The service is mediocre but the bar staff is cute which I guess makes up for mediocre service. Also a bit pricey, but not toooo out of line.   The Arcadia Tavern is a must visit restaurant/bar. You won't be disappointed.",

My cousin and I went here on the advice of another bar (guess not rivals down here) for us to find a Buffalo Sabres Hockey game on satellite.  Good move, the bar manager was nice and friendly and kind enough to get a feed for us to watch the hockey game.  Liked the beer, but glass was like fit for a kind -- it was huge goblet. I met the hostess/waitress and struck up a nice friendship, chatted a bit with her.   This a good place to visit on a stop in Phoenix..",

We walked in and decided to grab a table on the patio, where we sat unacknowledged for a good 10 minutes. Well actually that's not quite accurate -- we were given the \"stink eye\" by a server because apparently we committed the unforgivable sin of seating ourselves. The horror! (By the way there was no hostess nor a hostess area when we entered). When we finally received service, it was beyond slow and barely competent. We had bottled beer and when we asked for glasses, we got the \"sure, I'll be right back\" then sat & waited...and waited.... Then when my boyfriend approached the bartender for said glasses, he received an eye roll for his trouble. At that point we contacted the others in our party who were meeting us there that we were heading over to OHSO instead. This was my first time at Arcadia Tavern and my last.",

    "text": "There are three fabulous things about Arcadia:  1) A bar that actually looks good in the daytime. The flooring was beautiful and the fabric on the chairs complemented. It was very clean. 2) Every NFL game was being shown on Sunday, including the Packers/Lions. They were even all labeled and the waitress knew exactly where each one was being shown. 3) A hard to pick just one breakfast menu. I ended up choosing the bananas foster pancakes but bird in the hole needs to be tried.   These are enough that I will probably come back at least another time, just to try the other fantastic breakfast item.. maybe dinner (which looked equally pleasing). However, there are some annoyances to be dealt with:  1) The packers/lions game was being played on the patio, which was nice. However, the sound we were receiving was from another game and was annoying. 2) The service was a little slow. Our server would frequently come out and not check on us. I almost missed the breakfast cut off time because of this. However, she did offer to split our check which was well appreciated.  3) The mimosa was huge but not very mimosa-y.  One of my friends told me there is a section in the back that has video games and a play area for kids which seems like a nice added touch also.",

TATE TOTS:  I ate some tater tots off my friend plate, they were good.  2.  They serve beer in these really large cool goblets.... those looked fun.  I didn't have beer but the goblets were cool to look at.  3.  Easy to find location-- this helps when vision is impaired but of course, I wasn't driving, but I did see it from the street.  4.  The Patio:  nice patio, comfortable  5.  Server seemed nice, she did bring me many glasses of water that ended up watering the gravel outside but I insisted on refills.",

    "text": "Food:  Standard fare, nothing too inspiring, but then again, it's a Tavern.  I liked the Arcadia fries- a concept that seems to be too much for some people to handle:  A fried potato dish that eats like a nacho?  To me that's heaven.  Fried potato and Guacamole were meant to be together.  Burgers are swell... They play it safe, and for what they do, they do it well.  A tad pricey, but go during happy hour to shave a coule dollars if you're that concerned.  Drinks:  Drinks are reasonable, and for some reason, I just like drinking out of a schooner.  Well-lit, airy place, the bar setup with the TV's is a little funky- because the rail area is so narrow, you find yourself looking almost straight-up, and if you're at one of the ends, better hope your game is on one of the closest screens.  Not a big \"destination\", but all in all I liked it, and I live close by, so I'll be back.",

By far the best in town. It is a little spicy buy sweet at the same time. The Best! You have to try it. They have some good aps as well, especially the veggie/hummus plate for those who are looking out for the carbs.   It is basically a tavern that has pretty decent food, big bar and lots of tv's that will be great to watch football and basketball on. I would recommend it!",

From the hospitailty of the staff to the basic service I have not experienced a better place. Fun atmosphere for the entire family. If you have kids they have an area for you. I suggest you come on out to the Tavern and enjoy a night of great company and spirits! Food is great at a reasonable price! They have tv's everywhere for every game, and if it's ot on, just ask and you will see it! Hats off to the Arcadia Tavern crew for making any evening enjoyable!! Will definetley recomend this place to anyone in town or coming in town! Trust me a sure hit!!!",

It was also uncomfortably hot inside since they had half of the building open to accommodate the band which was playing way too loud. I guess 100+ at 8:00 pm means its time to open the doors and windows?   Giving two stars because the food was not terrible.  Oh, and the valet parking dudes are way too rough with the cars.

It's not the  most amazing bar in the world, it's not the most delicious food in the world, but it's a great, fun neighborhood bar (that's clean, open, airy, busy and non-pub'ish)...I read some reviews where people said the kids really bothered them.  I'm 27, don't have children, don't particularly like dealing with children (especially while I'm downing 15 ketel/sodas) but I can honestly say that I've never been bothered by kids at this place.  Yes, there's a corner of the restaurant that has a Wii.  Big deal.  The kids sit and play Wii and don't bother me...didn't really even register with me that this place is \"kid friendly\"  I usually sit at the bar or the bar area and drink their lovely fishbowl Dos Equis until I get hungry enough to order their wings or hummus platter.  I've had quite a few entrees too, including the caprese sandwich, chicken sandwich & spaghetti.  All were good.  Not great, sure, but most entrees are about $10...no big loss.    We usually start out here pre-drinking before we head to Scottsdale or some other overly-expensive bar.  Great place to go with co-workers or to watch a PAC-10/Big 10 (they have both sets of helmets at the bar)  game.",

If you are blue cheese dunker when it comes to wings, this place has AMAZING blue cheese dressing with ginormous cheese chunks in the dressing. Hello calories!  Also, the nachos are MASSIVE. I made the sorry mistake of ordering them just for myself as an entree and tried to eat half of it. Definitely an uphill battle.. no pun intended.. it's literally a hill of nachos.  We've found service to be a bit spotty. A couple times we've had to flag down a waitress for refills or another round of beers.  Parking can be a bit of a mess. Go buy a lottery ticket if you happen to find a parking spot during dinner hour here because that is something that very rarely happens.  Sports bar type of atmosphere.

I ordered a sandwhich and fries to go from this place, and it was just okay. Not that great of flavor and kind of greasy.   The second time I came, I pulled up to valet to which I encountered an awkward delay for a valet guy to come up, I didn't really know what to do, where he was or when he was coming.  In addition to that, when I came in, I ordered a harp beer. It was good, the ambiance was fine, it wasn't that busy. But when I asked for the check, the bartender nodded, and while I thought it was going to be provided right away, she was stalling doing different things, initiating conversations with fellow bar goers and even flirting with the guy next to me. It would be one thing if I was still working on my beer, but I had been finished by then. Then when she looked at me after flirting with the guy, she went from giddy to annoyed resting face instantly which I thought was pathetic.   After reviewing through multiple reviews, it appears to be a trend that this bartender repeats this type of behavior, the to go orders are not good and parking is a hassle which is always a relief to know that I am not the only one experiencing this pattern.   Given my experiences, I really do not care to come back.",

    "text": "So, I bought a Groupon for Arcadia Tavern. I vaguely remember going to Arcadia Tavern with friends a few years ago for beers and appetizers and had a pleasant time. So I thought I would go back and try out some more food.  The first time we tried going on a Saturday night. Several college games were playing, including ASU and UofA. My husband and I thought we would go watch the ASU game and try out the food at Arcadia Tavern. First the parking: My husband dropped me off to get a table while he tried to find parking and to avoid valet. Valet at a sports bar?? Really? While he was looking for parking, I attempted to get a table. I was told at the front that I could not get a table with just 2 of us on college game nights. We would have to share a table with other people. I was looking around and saw several empty tables. So then, I walked around the bar to look for 2 empty spots and had no luck. I noticed most of the TVs had the UofA game, some had other college games, and no TVs were playing ASU. Which is fine... I understand this is a UofA bar and hopefully I wouldn't get flack for wanting to change one of the TVs to ASU. But as I was walking back to the entrance a couple patrons started booing me very loudly, I assume because I was wearing an ASU shirt. A couple servers were there and just smiled. Classy....   So we left, drove 30 minutes to Santisi Brothers where there is no pretentious valet parking, plenty of TVs, cheap cocktails and beer, and the best calzones in Phoenix. I didn't even want to return to Arcadia Tavern. If my review ended now, I would give one star.  But we decided to return after football season. This time, they actually sat us at a table. We started with the pretzels and cheese sauce which were pretty good. My husband had the Reuben sandwich, which he enjoyed. I had the veggie burger. I was excited because it was well reviewed but I was disappointed. It was too big, so it was mushy and undercooked in the middle. I didn't care for the flavor and the texture. I did however, really enjoy the tater tots.  Service was okay. Our server was really nice but was not attentive at times. After we got our food, we had to wait another 5 minutes for silverware. We had to flag down another server for the silverware.   Overall, Arcadia Tavern redeemed itself from that first experience. I am willing to go back and try other menu items. But not during college games...",

Then she basically looked around and asked where we wanted to sit and quickly said no when we picked out a booth. Apparently the booths were reserved so if we did sit in them we had 45 mins. to eat and get out.   Aside from that the breakfast menu was simple and inexpensive. I ordered a breakfast sandwich that came with a side of country style potatoes and a bloody Mary. I wasn't too excited about the sandwich but that is only because I'm not a huge fan of breakfast food. (Unless I am hungover, then its on!)   I actually really like it here. The manager usually comes by and talks to us and I love their salads. It seems like we might have been there too early. I guess I will just stick to eating and drinking here in the evenings.",

Good luck getting a person on staff to look at you within the first hour you arrive.  If you want to just sit and watch the games, it's fine.  If you want to drink or eat while you watch football, go somewhere else.  Plenty of better options in the neighborhood.",

We sat in the outside patio and our server came by quickly.  She took our drink orders and came back with drinks pretty fast.  Then she took our food order.  While we were waiting sprinkles of rain, dust, and leaves came our way and into some of our drinks and appetizers.  We moved our party inside and Arcadia Tavern was helpful.    I ordered my prime dip with french fries.  The prime dip was pretty good and I am not sure how the fries tasted because I got tater tots.  It was a super busy night, so I did not want to say anything.  The tater tots were ok, I am not too much of a fan.",

That's it...you blow bubbles to \"inspire\" your fish and race away.    They have good drinks and most people are around the age of post grads and it has a good vibe to it.

I usually don't check my order before I leave, but I did this time. The turkey burger was all wrong. I brought this to the attention of the manager and he not only did he correct it, but he also purchased me a free drink and threw in a gift card for my next visit. Talk about great customer service. This is why my family visits Arcadia Tavern so often. Thank you so much!",

It doesn't come with a million layers of bread which is a huge turn off for me at many other restaurants. Too much bread makes it all taste so dry and hard to eat. This one comes with avocado which gives it a creamy taste.   Get the sweet potato tater tots! mmmmmm (actually all of their french fries are good).  The reason for the four stars... their service BLOWS!  I have never, once, had a good server. Get it together.",

We got there early enough to watch Louisville vs Clemson. Got a great seats. Ordered appetizers, few drinks and dinner. 4th quarter they changed all the TV's, but 1 small one, to the UofA game. That one small one was ASU.  Apparently the UofA Alum bought out the entire bar (TV's)! Not only did they not inform us, so signs posted, no warning this would happen, heck the waitress didn't even know what was going on until we complained. We moved to another table full of Louisville fans and watched the last 10 min on an iPhone!  Had we known, we would have had the opportunity to go elsewhere, right out the get go!  Pretty crappy that they roped us in and ruined our football night. Piss poor management.",

    "text": "This was an interesting dining experience for me. We went for the ASU Mizzu game (GO DEVILS!) From the moment that I walked in the door, I noticed that I was getting, once again, here's that term... \"eye fucked\" by one of the servers (I'll call her Allie to protect the guilty... not really, that is her name). I'm fine with that, and in my years on Earth, I've discovered that not all women actually want to have sex with me if they look at me. I have experienced, as well, that women, servers, strippers, like to use their sexuality to make a buck or two.   When we moved to her section (it was a comfy booth, perfect for watching the game), the overt flirting, hair flipping, and eyeballing continued. As we dined, she would address only me, and not my girlfriend. Odd I thought. Midway through the 3rd quarter, I had had enough of the antics. I wanted to see if she was genuinely interested in me as a person, in all of my cuteness, or was just being overtly sexual and flirty to get me to leave her more money.   When she approached the table and asked if we wanted dessert, I made some snarky suggestion that she should be on the menu. It went all downhill from there. She went from hair flipping flirty to watching the table from a far distance. We lost all interaction with her. I enjoy a server that flirts and hair flips if the server can stand her ground, is fun, and can play along. I AM NOT interested in a woman/server being overtly sexual and flirtatious and playing games as a ploy to generate revenue. It irked me that she was so overtly sexual and then acted like I was completely inappropriate by making a remark to her. Ridiculous. It also irked me that she refused to give us attentive service after that interaction.    Generally, I really like this place. Food is great. Service is great. Fun environment. Family and kid friendly. Can the food stand on 4 stars without service? Nah. Can the service stand on 2 stars without good food? No. So, it's a 3.",

When did a turkey sandwich become worth 15 bucks.  To substitute cheeses on my daughters meal from pepper jack to mozzarella was $2. Really? that should cost nothing. The thing that bugs me the most is the price of the drinks which most people don't ask the price on.  You expect a premium beer to be maybe 6 for a stein.  Nope 10 and you learn this at bill time.  Sorry I didn't ask. I am not a cheapskate but there is a tipping point where i feel gouged. This ain't Tavern On The Green and 3 adults and 2 kids should not cost $130. I hope Arcadia Tavern takes this to heart because feedback is valuable.  As far as i am concerned i will go to OHSO or Rehab Burger in Old Town.  Just as good and not nearly as spendy.",

Well ok, there is no such thing as a \"fall evening\" in Arizona cuz it's still in the 90s, my bike is broken and I'm not super crazy about the Vikings, but I will have a beer! This is the kind of place I could actually spend a couple of hours in to watch an exciting game over a few beers with my peeps. Super cool atmosphere. On the bar side.   On the other side...I can see how some people might be bothered by rambunctious children and pre-adolescents. Follow these simple directions: enter and turn right.   The food is decent. I had the \"Roasted Veggie\" Salad - there wasn't much that felt \"roasted veggie\" or fresh about it, but at least it's a lighter option for the meatless crowd. The jalapeno/cilantro hummus was excellent. The plain hummus was, well, plain. The pretzels tasted a little stadium-ish but the beer is a good solution for that. The waitstaff and bartenders are stellar. This will definitely be chalked up to \"cool neighborhood joint\" in a list-to-be.",

Asked for waters with our beers, never got them.  Got the bruschetta ( which was pretty solid), but no plates.  Asked for plates, never got them so had to find some on another table.  Asked for another beer, never got it.    Everyone was drunk.  Which is fine, we had a few beers too, but it was Sunday at 1pm......  So anyway, the menu looks promising so I'm sure we'll come back at some point.  Just not anytime soon.",

A group of guys, obviously regulars, were partying hard at lunchtime, and obviously didn't  care that they weren't the only ones in the place. Lunch?  A reuben unlike any other (white bread?) but a fine sandwich nonetheless and good onion rings. Then I became invisible.  After finishing, I got to watch the bartender work for twelve minutes, including teasing the guys at the bar, while I waited for my check.  Finally, I was able to wave her down and escape. Return?  No, but they've obviously got a good business going, so they won't care. I must add for some reason she bought my beer, thus, three stars instead of two.",

    "text": "Arcadia Tavern is one of my top five favorite places to wash sports in the Valley. With a bar on the right side and restaurant style seating on the left side, it's a solid sports bar for either a family or young professionals looking to have some cocktails and bar food.  Since I am kid-less, I normally hang out on the right side. If people complain about walking into empty bars in the Valley, then head over to Arcadia Tavern because on a game night, chances are you won't be able to find an empty seat there. But don't let that deter you because it's worth staying for a seat to open up.   I like Arcadia Tavern for several types of occasions: if I'm looking for a place to watch the game, to have some food and drinks before going out or to eat lunch on a weekend afternoon. The patio is great and when the weather's nice, it's a must visit. Arcadia Tavern is in a random location within Arcadia but it's perfect neighborhood joint with so many houses nearby. Parking can be a bit tough so you might want to park across the street and walk.   As for food, this is your classic neighborhood bar so it has all American food. The burger is great and I normally go for the BBQ chicken sandwich. If you're a fan of nachos, give those a try.   So if you're looking for a neighborhood bar with TVs and a fun atmosphere, you should check out Arcadia Tavern.",

    "text": "So this update is long overdue, since I've been here several more times in the last year and half since my initial review. I dropped my rating for a couple reasons.   Two things people rave about are the goblets and the food. Well the goblets are only good ice cold and it really sucks when you're served a beer in one that is room temp and then you see someone else getting one immediately after you, in an ice cold one. Is it because they're a regular and know the bartender by name and know their life story? I'm not sure. But wouldn't an icy goblet served to a non-regular be a good way to entice them to become a regular?   As for the food, it is pretty good for the most part. Above average for bar food. But I expect that here because it is more than just a bar. Families come here for dinner, which is why there's a separate dining room. The edamame is delicious. Sliders are good. Pizza is just average, but the thing that really threw me off were the chicken tenders. They had to have been the worst I've ever had. It wasn't even real chicken. It was merely pressed meat. You can get better ones at a fast food place.   However, I love that they have Abita Turbo Dog, among other beers. And that it's a place to cheer for the New Orleans Saints. Now if they had a good cup of seafood gumbo..........",

This is not what I am looking for when I roll to a bar at the end of the day to booze-kill my horrible work week.  It's clearly their aim, however, as every table contained at least two kids and they have wiis and toys set up in a back area of the restaurant for them.  Legos and blocks flying all over the place.  They serve the draught beer in these absurdly oversized heavy margarita glasses.  I had to hold my glass with both hands just like the toddlers all around me.  I ordered chicken strips which I am positive came frozen from Costco.  A friend ordered the bruschetta board, the presentation of which was pretty awful but clearly a blatant rip on Postino.  I tried their salami and pesto (sounds familiar) and the mascarpone and prosciutto, neither was very impressive.  The server was forgetful and rather dotty, doing things like taking two out of three drink orders and suddenly walking away.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.",

Service: Can be poor - be patient with them  Food: Fries are for sure frozen Margherita pizza is good (but not the best I have had) Really like the wings and salads  They have good beer choices and they serve large portions  Prices are decent for the food.  Kids: They have X-boxes and Wii games in a kids corner to keep them occupied, so if you don't like to have kids around while watching football you may want to go some where else.  Atmosphere: Comfy - big half circle booths and large picnic tables.  Four stars because we typically get poor service but we get to watch our game, eat decent food, and keep the kids occupied.",

They said it was a nice place, so I decided to go clear to the other side of Phoenix just to meet someone for lunch and try it out.  And I have to say...  My guest and I were pleasantly greeted, and taken care of really well. :-) 5 out of 5 stars.  The blonde waitress there named Alli is one of the best servers I've ever had wait on me in the last 15 years.  The food was good, the atmosphere was pleasant (went during lunch today/wednesday afternoon around 3pm), and the price was as expected...but the service was outstanding and I made sure the tip reflected it. Well deserved.  The waitress was prompt, friendly, courteous, professional, kind, and very welcoming. It was more like going to an enjoyable event by the end than a regular visit to a restaurant, and I really liked that feeling. It was very comfortable.  The first impression is always the strongest and most lasting. For some it is good, for others not depending on the day and people I'm sure...but from the cook to the hospitality, everything was stellar today.  Thanks to the staff at Arcadia and to Alli for making it such a nice day there. Will definitely be back with others, and highly recommend.",

This was a free option till recently. It's already on the higher end for lunch. The burgers are $12, and you usually have to valet. The additional $2 charge for tots is extreme. I know; I'm cheap, but if you add a soda and tip, you've got a $20 lunch.  Anyway, the increased prices, some spotty service I've had recently, and a couple of bad meals made me take this off the rotation.   If you do decide to go, I'd recommend the burgers or salads. I didn't like the bland $15 french dip. I also didn't care for the buffalo chicken wrap that was missing blue cheese. I mentioned the missing blue cheese to the waitress, but she insisted it was in there. I told her I couldn't see it or taste it, and I was sure it was not in my wrap. Once again she said it was in the wrap and then asked me if I wanted \"more\" blue cheese... Ugh, It seems like it would have been easier to just grab a side of blue cheese from the kitchen.

Our group of 6 was there for 3 hours for Sunday football and the entire time service was an issue. We had to ask the other server to find our waitress numerous times. 1 person in our group had to grab their own drink that was sitting at the well while the waitress was just sitting at the hostess station. Waitress also sat at a table and watched 1 person from our group arrive and she never came over to take their order until we asked her to. I can understand when a place is packed and someone's working hard but to be sitting and ignoring customers makes us never want to return. So unfortunate.",

The drinks are priced competitively for the area and the bartenders are pretty receptive/quick. The place is covered in TVs and can get a little loud during bigger games, for good or bad. They seem to have a very strict rule about hiring attractive female bartenders, I don't think I've ever seen an exception to this rule in quite some time.",

However, the last few times I've been there the patio area is ridiculously understaffed.  At the last event I waited 45 minutes to order a tap beer!!!  I really wish management did a better job keeping tabs on U of A watch party events.  (fix this and I'll give you 2 more stars!!)  Anyway, the bar food here is great.  There's a large selection of salads, soups, and appetizers.  Happy hour is a great deal full of food and drink options.    I love that this Arcadia Tavern offers complementary valet parking due to restricted space.  Remember to tip your valet!!!!!",

The best seating to me is at the bar where the shenanigans never run short with the regulars. Staff is incredibly friendly and sweet. I am a big fan of their gigantic Bloody Mary and draft beers. My fave items are the ahi tuna salad and sliders. If you're going to watch the games or pretend to, at least order the wings, naked with a side of all the sauces. You'll find right in :)  I am looking forward to returning after the remodel is complete and can't wait to enjoy football season at one of my fave local spots.",

    "text": "Really enjoyed this place on a Saturday night.  I ordered the burger with bacon and avacado (it had a fancy name I can't remember!) and it was absolutely delicious.  The bacon was cut thick and not overly crispy, while the chipotle mayo and bleu cheese \"cooled\" off and balanced the flavor of this burger.   A side salad is an option with burgers and sandwiches--albeit with a $2 up-charge.  Not bad, but as someone who prefers a healthier option to the standard fries, I like it when restaurants give you the salad option at no added cost.  The beer list is decent with local and seasonal brews on tap.  We ate out by the bar on the patio. Despite there being TVs with sporting events on, plus some road noise from Indian School Rd., it was an enjoyable evening and easy to hold a conversation. The patio has a very high hedgewall which helps to insulate it.  Arcadia Tavern also does Groupon and other promos from time to time, so definitely check into this beforehand if you're a stickler for a deal.   As most decent restaurants do along this corridor on Indian School, they have a valet parking service during peak hours. Personally I hate having valets touch my car under any circumstances.  Other people may appreciate this service.  So in summary--delicious American pub style food, nice patio, good atmosphere, reasonable price.  Highly recommend.",

I showed up to a very busy bar and was informed by one of the employees that they weren't selling ribs this evening but had my order of Sliders.  I began to question the employee that this could have been told to me while placing the phone order at which time an older gentleman who I believe to be the owner walked over and asked what was the problem.. the owner was obviously drunk and instead of apologizing and making this right only had one response and that was \" we are not selling ribs tonight end of story\"..   If you are placing a pickup order I recommend you verify with the employee that they have the food items you are ordering so that this doesn't happen to you when you pick up the order 45 minutes later hungry and at dinner time..  The owner can work on his customer service and probably stay off the sauce as it was only 6:00 at night and he was already drunk and rude. There are several other bars in that area that I would recommend to include JT's, OHSO or The Vig to avoid this mishap an experience with an ignorant owner.",

If you are an Arizona Wildcat fan, don't be fooled by this place claiming to be a UofA bar... They advertise their specials for the football game on their Facebook page, but don't have the proper cable service to air it (apparently they can't get Pac-12 network).  After taking over 30 minutes just get a beer (which was warm) we finally got our appetizer, which turned out to be undercooked chicken wings (very obviously so).  When bringing this up and requesting to speak to a manager about all of our problems, the response we got was \"He's behind the bar\".  Never was he sent to our table.  When we then brought up our awful experience to an another employee, the response we got was \"I don't even know what's going on in this place right now\" in obvious frustration.  We arrived just after 6pm and watched the back dining area completely fill up in anticipation of the football game.  When we left right before 7, it was completely empty because everyone had left due to the many problems (bad service, bad food, no game, etc.). I know why the others left because we were all talking with one another about how bad things were here.  This place used to awesome, but not anymore.  This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a restaurant/bar.",

    "text": "My husband was surprised that I wanted to go here for dinner because I don't typically eat at bars (although I do enjoy drinking at them).  But my interest was piqued by their self-reference as \"family friendly.\"  I don't associate a tavern as a family destination, but those with the most kids sometimes need to drink the most.    We played it safe though and left our rugrats with grandpa.  Arcadia Tavern was True to their word - in addition to a kids menu, kids eat free on Mondays. And, in the back, there is a whole area designated to kids...with a television, video game console, activity table and play kitchen.  There were a lot of young kids there, all were well behaved, and happily eating and/or smearing ketchup on their face. That makes this place 1% mall play area.  My water glass came adorned with a cucumber.  I love having cucumbers in my water. That makes this place 1% spa.  The menu provides everything you would expect from a tavern...wings, burgers, french fries, sliders... but there were also some non-expected items, like numerous fresh salads.  They even had a grilled vegetable salad - that makes this place 1% farmers market.  I ordered the steak salad, which came on a huge bed of spinach, big chunks of well-seasoned steak, and marinated mushrooms.  My husband took the more manly approach and ordered some burger, covered in bacon,  covered in cheese. They also had thin-crust pizzas, bruschetta, and sliced ahi tuna.  At the end of the day though, it's still 97% a bar...but its pretty good bar food.  If you check in on Yelp, you get a $5 off coupon. However, you cannot use this coupon in conjunction with a Groupon, or the Kids Eat Free Monday.  I don't care for that policy, but if you don't have a Groupon or kids, then it works.",

I came to the Arcadia Tavern the other night with a party of six. I was happy that we were able to be seated right away, but we were given a pretty odd table that had an uncomfortable bench for us to sit on. By the end of the meal my back was killing me from the awkwardness of the bench.    I was disappointed to see the selection of beer was pretty limited and expensive for what they had to offer. Fortunately there was a $4 drink special going on Saturday night for a vodka drink or a Dos Equis draft. The Vodka Soda drinks were pretty good, but not nearly as strong as most in town (If you are wondering, I think The Crescent Ballroom has the strongest in town).  To order I settled on the Veggie Burger. It was a very good black bean burger that came with a side of fries. I opted to upgrade my side for $2 to try the sweet potato totes. This turned out to be a good call since the fries and regular totes were not very good. The burger itself, although delicious, was cooked at too high of a temperature. There were certain parts of the burger that were charred that I was forced to pick off.",

    "text": "After the Ohio State Rose Bowl win on Friday, my husband, a friend, and I decided to check out Arcadia Tavern to watch the other Ohio team playing in a BCS bowl game. For a Friday evening, it wasn't too crowded - the bar area seemed a bit more full but the restaurant area to the immediate left of the entrance was about half full. Here are my thoughts on our experience:  1) Loved that beer was served in goblets.   2) While the parking is complimentary valet, I hate when I can literally see my car in the parking lot, yet I have to have the valet pull it out of the parking space across from where I am standing.  3) The tater tots were delicious and a great side with my chicken caprese sandwich.  4) The food was overpriced for bar/pub grub. There were some inventive items on the menu, but overall the menu was almost exactly what you'd find at TGI Friday's. Our bill came to $57 which included three sandwiches, an appetizer, 1 beer and 1 soda.  5) There are a lot of TVs throughout the space, so it's great for sports watching. However, did they have to have every single TV tuned to the Sugar Bowl? Couldn't we also have had some NBA games on?  6) Why do places in Phoenix insist on having only one single stall bathroom for men and one single stall bathroom for women?   7) There is a Wii area set up near the back, so I guess if you bring your children or are a child at heart yourself, there is entertainment for you!  8) I did appreciate one staff member stepping up and finding a pair of children's parents when the kids were acting up by running around the restaurant, fighting with each other, and sliding across the wood floor, and overall acting like two monkeys that just escaped the zoo. Unfortunately the parents were found sitting at the bar because apparently parenting their children was too much to ask while out at a public establishment.  Overall I found Arcadia Tavern to be a 3.5 star establishment (I'm sure it's actually not bad for Sunday NFL viewing because of the amount of TVs), but am rounding down to 3.",

    "text": "My first visit to the Arcadia Tavern--a four-star trip. (If everything lives up to the initial impression on subsequent visits, I'll raise the rating to five stars.)  Arrived at about 3:30 pm on a Friday, but tiny parking lot was already full. Not to worry, though, as free valet parking guys appeared to whisk cars across the street to the large parking lot of a funeral home.  Venue offers three distinct seating areas. To the left at entry is a restaurant area with large booths and tables. Lots of high quality large flat screen TVs, even a separate area for kids with TV content appropriate for youngsters. Middle portion of venue is a bar with both at-bar seating and high four-tops. (I chose that one.) To the right is a nice outdoor patio, screened by bushes from busy Indian School Rd and with ample tables and shade umbrellas. As the afternoon unfolded, people arrived so that by 5:30, bar and patio areas were full.  Menu offered lots of interesting choices; I had an \"Arcadia Club\" sandwich--featuring LOTS of turkey, tasty apple wood smoked bacon, avocado, and delicious chipotle mayo. Side of fries was crispy and nicely seasoned. Draft beers included a number of my favorites, and many additional cans/bottles, so no one should leave thirsty.  Star of the visit, though, was the outstanding service. Friendly server, came quickly, delivered food and drinks in timely way, and stopped by often to see if anything else was needed. Server was Lauren, who handled the bar area 6-8 tables superbly. Other areas appeared equally will-served. Appears to be a restaurant with knowledgeable management, as additional servers appeared as the place filled.  I will definitely return!",

    "text": "Its hard not to love Arcadia Tavern.  First of all, the spot has completely rewritten the history of this anchor space at the SEC of 48th Street and Indian School after many lackluster restaurants died miserable deaths prior.  Second, to have a local neighborhood sports bar that has the game day atmopsphere of a college hangout, but then serves the quality and variety of food that A-T does, makes its a great stop any time of the day or week.  Finally, its walking distance to and from my house, and if I ride the beach cruiser up, there may be a free beer involved. Not only is the beer ice cold, but its served in a frozen chalice the way beer deserves to be honorably presented.  Hot pretzel with spicy cheese, Prime Rib Dip, Tavern Burger, Tavern Wings, Tavern Tots....just a few of my personal favorites.  If your looking for a local Arcadia watering hole, that you can get a fantastic meal, look no further than the Tavern.",

My dinner experience took me into the kid corner where our booth was right next to all the action. That night, there was a lot of screaming and running and normal kid fun. We were a group of adults with a non-kid night, kinda... it was like people just got their booth, the kids got their table and then they let them go... the 1.5 hours we were there was non-stop action.   The food. The place has a good variety from sandwiches and salads that are good, to items like meatloaf and fish and chips. Overall the portions are good and the service it good. The food has always been a little too salty for my taste. Dunno what it is, but just wish it was less salty. Drinks are good and they usually have good specials.   Never had the bar experience there, but it looks comfortable enough. I used to come here when it was western pizza, so the same peeps make it a consistent neighborhood crowd. It is one of those, \"Oh yeah - lets go there\" places.",

    "text": "Over-priced, over-salted and thoroughly unimaginative. Package those adjectives up in a pretty little nutshell and you've got Arcadia Tavern. Arcadia Tavern is a family-friendly, bland and inoffensive, if not overpriced, alternative to Applebee's or TGI Friday's.   I was seriously enthused when a tavern opened up within a five minute walk of my house. I like drinking and I like walking. Combine the two and you get stumbling, which can also have its high points, ripped jeans notwithstanding. But Arcadia Tavern is no tavern. No self-respecting tavern can commit the cardinal sins of happy hour and retain their integrity.  Cardinal rule #1: Thou shalt not end happy hour before 7 pm.   Seriously. What is it with places trying to redefine Happy Hour as the hours between 3 and 6 pm? I understand that from a price point perspective the 3-4 or 4-5 pm hours are much cheaper than extending food and drink discounts to the 6-7 pm crowd. But I consider that the same as shining up a turd and calling it a custom made gift. Ooo, you offer three hours of happiness? Pity I can only make 15 minutes of it.   Bottom line is 5 pm's whistle blowing time, gridlock makes a girl crave a drink and 6-7 pm is the prime hour for getting that drink on. To end happy hour before 7pm pretty much guarantees happy hour barflies will not frequent the establishment.  Flipside: Three dollar Dos Equis, all day, every day. At least there's that.  Cardinal rule #2: Thou shalt offer more than frozen food and canned items as appetizers, and if offering cheap frozen crap, it shall be reflected in the price.   Fries, tater tots, onion rings, wings, mozzarella sticks, chicken strips, and the ubiquitous spinach and artichoke dip? Whoa. Don't strain yourself, TGI Friday's.   My main gripe is with the monster nachos. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills, but the chips, seasoned shredded chicken and nacho cheese were all wicked salty. We're talking mouth-puckering, tastebud-slaughtering salt laden nachos topped with canned pickled jalapenos (gross), black olives (more salt) and black beans (respect).  I'm also biased against the unnatural plastic consistency of nacho cheese. It makes everything soggy and is a tacky substitute for the real deal. Cheese should crisp up around the edges and pull apart in delectable strings, not ooze sadly over a mass of chips and overpower everything else on the plate. I will say that the guacamole and pico de gallo that topped the nachos were delicious, tasted homemade and were a saving grace, but they were also woefully underrepresented compared to the macnasty nacho sauce.   Flipside: The three mini sliders (albeit meager) and grilled veggies platter with hummus showed promise.   Cardinal rule #3: Thou shalt provide affordable drink and nosh.  So what's that nacho monstrosity going to run you? Twelve bucks. Don't blink. You read right. Twelve dollars for salty garbage. Mozzarella sticks? 7. Dozen wings? 9! Completely unrealistic. Shave a couple bucks off each appetizer and you're in the reasonable price zone, particularly considering the cheap tasting ingredients. Taking that first impression into account, I don't think I'm going to shell out 10-12 dollars for a hamburger (without fries) when I could go to Delux and have my socks blown off with flavor for cheaper or to the Chicago Hamburger Co. for pennies in comparison.   Flipside: There is no positive here. For the caliber of food offered, the prices are completely unrealistic. Even the desserts are overpriced. Six bucks for a root beer float? That's a big middle finger right there.  Arcadia Tavern, as a representative of the Happy Hour enforcement squad, I hereby declare you undeserving of your title. Four Peaks is a tavern. The Vine is a tavern. Icehouse is a tavern. Hell, even Carlsbad Tavern does it better and they have plastic bats hanging from the ceiling.   I regret that I shall never again spend a happy hour in your warm embrace. Although you may still win me over with $3 you-call-its on Thursday after 9 pm. Particularly when accompanied by a little goldfish racing.   I totally hate goldfish, too. At least share that in common.",

There is, as far as I know, ONE organized Saints group in the Phoenix area. And they watch at Arcadia Tavern. While I had been in with friends several times before knowing this, I'm a regular during football season now, and have been for quite some time. The management is fantastic. Truly customer satisfaction driven. They have gone above and beyond on several occasions for the viewing group as a whole, and for me personally. The service is hit and miss. I know we can be a large and unruly group sometimes - but many of the servers are clearly new and not fully trained on how to best deal with us.  Some servers (Erica, I'm talking to you!) are incredible - and should give seminars on how to get it done well and with a smile! The place itself is comfortable and well appointed, and I am impressed with how they have really incorporated locals and the area into the feel and theme. The menu is solid. Plenty of choices no matter what your dietary restrictions, hunger level or mood. And it's all well executed.  Great specials - and easy to feel welcome. Their slogan is \"All good in the hood\" - and Arcadia - you are \"What's good in the hood!\"",

    "text": "I preface by saying: we wanted to like this place. We can bike to it, it's family-friendly and did i mention that it's close? It is busy even before 6pm. Parking is only achieved through luck or valet. Kudos to word getting out about Arcadia Tavern. But...  REVIEW Uninspired bar food in a clean, open, friendly atmosphere. Lack of imagination is clear in the tired sports grill theme - aging fratboy paradise. Might as well be a chain. Then the execution might be tighter. The pizza was basically Freschetta ultra-thin crust, made to order. Almost looked like the pizza in the Nutrisystem commercials - undercooked and topped with processed items.  Fish n' Chips usually deserve their own paragraph. These get 2 paragraphs, but for the wrong reasons:  Fish n' chips batter should be bound to the fish at the molecular level. Attempting to peel the crust off should result in tearing away fish flesh, or revealing fish that is crispy around the edge with the bound batter unwilling to separate. Fish n' Chips don't bend! Cook hot, cook fast, cook through. You can easily achieve this at home with a Waring fryer. A decent batter and a properly used commercial fryer should be a slam-dunk.   Anatomy of an unacceptable fish n' chip: hunk of barely cooked through whitefish, surrounded by a loose layer of mushy batter than is not bound to the fish at all, with a fried-looking but barely crisp outer edge. I removed the end of the fish stick and shook it and the lump of fish fell out of the sad greasy tube. No discernible flavor unless dunked in the accompanying restaurant supply grade tartar slop.   Tots? A moment of inspiration? Sadly no. The key to a tot is that it's made up of little distinct chunks of potato. Like a tiny hash brown capsule. You should be able to break them open and pull apart the pieces. Fast food can even pull this off - the Taco John Potato Ole for example. These were more like greasy, fried mash potatoes. And salty. I'm not drunk enough for this.  I want to give it 3 stars for being clean, having decent service and having no less than 20 plasma displays. But 3 is A-okay. I think there might be something A-okay there, but we haven't found it yet. We will return to try the sliders just to see if there is a dependable fallback dish for those nights when we just don't feel like cooking and want somewhere close. In the meantime, if the owners (investors, more like) care to be more than just the next thing to FAILBOAT in that space, they need to get back to the food. Once the buzz fades, the food will not bring people back. Go to Four Peaks Tempe. Go to Matt's Big B. Go to George n' Dragon. Go to Lo Lo's for chrissake. Go see how simple food can still be good food, and not scream \"short-term, dabbling in the industry business model\".  Will update after another visit. Maybe.",

My girlfriend and I walked in and was told to have about a 20min wait, no problem that's standard. Our table was ready in about 10 which was great. We get seated look over the menu 5...10...15 mins pass by and we were not even greeted by a server. 2 other couples seated after us had drinks before we even met a waitress. My girlfriend asked one of the bus boys if we can see a server he replies with a very rude and monotone voice \"Working on it\". Another 10 mins pass by still no server. We promptly get up and leave. As we were leaving we pass by the same hostess that seated us and she says \"oh I guess they are leaving you can have that table\" to another couple just walking in. I promptly told the couple don't waste your time we never saw our waitress for 30 mins. I'm glad to see that I'm not the only yelper that thinks their \"wait\" staff is terrible. Wait being the key term in that phrase. This place would get zero stars if allowed",

    "text": "So Arcadia Tavern has a nice decor, good patio with misters and tvs (bar opens up to it), a friendly staff and the people we sat near at the bar were friendly and fun.    Watched a hockey game here last night and had a good time (hard not to with the company I was with). ;)  It was pretty packed (I had heard it gets busy during happy hour) and was able to stake claim to some bar seats.  We ordered off of the happy hour menu (shared a hamburger with tots and bruschetta).  So the burger was pretty good, tots were tots - yummy and crispy, and bruschetta was ok as well.  Let's face it - after spending any amount of time at Postino's, it's difficult to \"love\" any other bruschetta!  We had the pesto/salami (pesto was tasty), artichoke, and the brie and fig spread.  The fig spread was yummy and I think it was homemade.  We also received spinach and artichoke dip (staff had told us they were out of bruschetta and asked us to order something else, but the bruschetta came out anyways???) The dip came out later...we tried to eat it, but we were full and to be honest it was just your standard dip. Fortunately, they didn't charge us for it, because we barely touched it. We mainly ordered off of the happy hour menu - it was a good value.   Overall, they seemed to have a decent beer selection (they were out of the nut brown nimbus - boo!) and some tasty drinks.  I had the grapefruit martini - pretty yummy.  The beer is served in these huge goblets...I would probably go with steins or beer mugs, but hey - guess they are trying to be different.  Also, looks like they do trivia on Tuesday nights (fun!).    Arcadia Tavern all around seems like a cool little neighborhood place with a little hipster flare.  I thought it was an 'A-ok!' place to hang out at for the evening, but nothing about it struck me as being exceptional...but I'll definitely be back to try out some other items on the menu or for drinks and will update the review when I do.",

    "text": "Stopped by Arcadia Tavern tonight around 9:15 pm and it was packed... Granted, it was a perfect evening to be outside for an August night in Phoenix.  The entire patio was full, the bar area had not an empty seat, and from the looks of it, the restaurant was doing some decent biz as well.  Jack Young was the singer/guitar player rockin' the place with tunes from Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Jimmy Buffet, and more.    I'd already eaten dinner, but Jared shared a bite of his miso salmon (with rice and asparagus) and it was delicious.  I'm writing this update partially to let it be known that this is just one of the new menu options along with chicken parm, steak salad, edamame, roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, caprese, chopped, and cobb salads.  I guess the feedback made its way to management... I am pleased with the new variety of healthy choices.  Robert, the Chef, came out to say hello - or perhaps we caught him red handed having a drink at the bar... either way, it was nice to see him.   I'll be back on my own sometime soon to order my own miso salmon... and if not me, you'll likely find Jared drinkin' a Guinness at the bar.  Cheers!",

We called a day ahead of time to make a reservation for 11, we were given a table the barely fit 8 and then after 30 min they gave us 1 extra chair. Took 30 minutes to get anyone to acknowledge us and that was after we flagged someone down who wasn't even our server. When the beer came 20 min after that the order was wrong and never fixed. We tris to speak to a manager and she refused to come back from behind the bar to speak to us. When we tried to order more food we had to hunt down our \"actual\" server RACHEL who never introduced herself. We asked for the appropriate beer that was ordered to be brought and she said she already gave us one and she put the ticket in right so she didn't know what to do. We said we've been waiting over an hour one person never got his beer and 3 of our party never got waters. She then said everyone is waiting a while she can't do anything then asked us if we wanted separate checks, We said we want to order more beer and she rolled her eyes and walked away from us without even talking any order at all. She was very rude to us for no reason. We paid our tab and left. They were horribly understaffed which is a severe problem with the management but that is no excuse for a server to be rude. I will never come back here and management needs to get it together and figure out how to properly run a restaurant.",

I say this because they do Not honor happy hour specials for people sitting on the (non)bar side.. So what your telling \"us\" is~ Don't come here for dinner and a happy hour drink after the kids game! So different from the days when kids jerseys hung in the rafters, watching the kids laugh while we took a short break and caught up with other parents. The food is still good and the staff tries, but I feel punished for being a mom at the tavern!",

We got a table out on the patio on a great night and had a good view of the game from the TV outside.  Also, they had happy hour prices on drinks all night, so $3.50 for a pint of Four Peaks Hop Knot.  How would I dare to give this place under 4 stars.lol.  We ended up ordering some of the food too, buffalo chicken sliders and the buffalo chicken pizza.  Both hit the spot and were a great compliment to beer and UofA basketball!  The bar is cool, nice open garage doors, perfect on a good day or night.  Nice view of Camelback from the patio, lots of TVs on the patio, bar and inside the restaurant.  Also a cool play area with Xbox in the corner of the bar.  Kinda cool if you ask me.  My only complaint, there were small bathrooms.  Just one male and one female bathroom.  Also, I wish they could have turned up the volume of the game to the patio.  It was tough to hear the game, but I would bet there are some noise ordinances they have to follow seeing it's close houses.  Overall, a solid sports bar. I will come back for big games, this time I'll be more picky on where I sit so I can hear the game better!",

It was about 6 o'clock on a weekend night . They were about 25 % full. I took my daughter and her friend . They both ordered grilled chicken avocado sandwiches with french fries and I ordered an Arcadia Tavern burger. It took us about 40 minutes to get our food. We had to track down the waitress a couple times to find out when the food was coming. Once our food arrived. My daughter and her friend both said the chicken tasted burnt and like a freezer . My hamburger was uncooked and looked like it had been sitting for a while. I would say it's one of the worst $15 per plate experiences I've had. The three plates alone without drinks cost $45 so I asked to talk to the manager.  When I told the manager what was going on he was shocked and said that he nearly never gets complaints. Does he read social media ?? He promised that the chicken did not go from being frozen to cooked tonight. Great so instead of just saying sorry he gave excuses.  Since we had already cashed the Groupon he offered a $40 gift card. I would have preferred cash back . Not sure I want to try again. More than frustrated.",

    "text": "This place is AWESOME!!  I used to go WAY back when the property was a desolate pizza place.  I was really impressed with the decor, atmosphere, wine list, beer selection, food and most of all their acts to accommodate children!!!  What a brilliant idea!!  People with children do have money and do want to spend it at places that don't have a play-land!  We went on a Friday for Happy Hour (again I recommend) and even got to sample a new Iced Tea Vodka - Deep Eddie's (that I can't wait to have again).   The service was just attentive enough but not intrusive.  We may have been too preoccupied with conversation and kids too have a two-way conversation with our server all the time.  We made sure to take care of her though.  My Yelp friends know I look for a good wine menu and that influences my rating - they had a great selection for wine lovers and those new to wine.  They had a packed patio as they had some outdoor festivities going on which added A LOT of energy to the place!!  Super fun - take your friends, take your family, take your kids and have a great time as there seems to be something cool going on everyday!  Most places don't like to do too many specials as they think it may \"confuse\" the guests but doing it this way makes it exciting to go any day of the week!  I would suggest one thing... maybe more bathrooms?  Unless I am mistaken, there were only 1 set of bathrooms (like 1 toilet each men and women) on one side of the restaurant and 1 set on the other side.  I'm hoping I missed something but that won't stop me from going back and telling everyone how awesome this place is!!",

My guess is that we just got lucky when it comes to parking, since there is a valet option.  I'm not a big fan of parking hassles so the place needs to be awesome to overcome that.  Also - seriously, the restrooms can only handle one person at a time in a BAR that is that size??  That is something that is not good at all.   There is a good drink menu with a great amount of locally made beers.  I went with the buffalo chicken sandwich, which I thought was good.  It could have been saucier for my taste, but it came out ripping hot (temperature-wise) which I love.  The fries were not as hot but seasoned nicely.   My other half seemed to like her burger but she did not rave about it. All in all - for a place that is out of the way for us, it would really have to be great and this was not to that level.  Now if I lived walking distance away....maybe that would be a different story.  But to me, I expected more from a place that was on Check Please AZ.",

I understand when a bartender is busy with a full restaurant and bar that they can't make me the center of attention but when that bartender is busy with a personal conversation it becomes a problem. Had to ask for a menu, wasn't asked if I would like another beer or anything else, was simply given a tab....??? Also, it's nice to at least make eye contact when you're asking how the food was or when you're handing someone a tab they didn't ask for. Once again, usually not a big deal when a place is slammed but when I'm being treated like this while you're having a 20 minute conversation with a guy at the bar 4 feet from me and chopping cucumbers.... seriously. I've never been made to feel so unwelcome in an establishment; apparently ownership has a problem with making money. Basic things like checking on your customers and asking if they'd like another beer shouldn't be ignored just because your staff is pretty. I generally let stuff like this go and chalk it up as just catching someone on a bad day but this is now the second time I've received service like this from Arcadia Tavern.",

The atmosphere is cool- like I said, a ton of TVs and a good amount of tables inside and out but the staff wasn't memorable and neither was the food. I went during happy hour but wasn't given a happy hour menu and when I asked the bar staff, they looked at each other and asked \"wait ...what drinks/food is on happy hour?\" as if they didn't know themselves. Really? You don't know your own happy hour? That's strange. I probably won't be back but it would be a good place to watch a game",

    "text": "I was in the area and the place called to me . I liked its plant screened patio on the busy street with TVs. I had a need for a Margarita and a mid day buzz. I liked the name and location and was looking at rentals in the area so I thought I neighborhood tavern might be a good selling point on my rental selection.  I arrived during happy hour. Wouldn't have known it if I had not noticed a sizable number of professional clean cut people drinking, the bar staff certainly did not enlighten me to the fact that happy hour is from 3pm -6pm - this I learned by researching after the fact online. So no specials were told to me and none were given. I asked for a margarita on the rocks with salt without the Grand Mariner because I had no intentions on paying $9 for the Tavern's Rita at Happy Hour time. Well the girl fetched me my request in a quick and friendly manner. She checked back with me too. But since the drink came in a large ice loaded glass as all the drinks I could see were as well, something told me have one and check out the price. Lo and behold I got a cheaper version of the Tavern's Rita only to find I was still paying $9 Bucks for it at Happy Hour! I was so ticked by it I was tempted not to tip the hustler! I tipped her a buck and called it quits. I asked her if all their margaritas were $9, and she said yes. Something tells me that's a lie.   Anyway the food looks good but also a bit pricier than your average neighborhood tavern or grill. And I see from their website that they have food and wine specials throughout the week.  The place is nice and the crowd seemed nice. I like how the garage doors open up one side of the building on the E. Indian School side of the road. If I lived in the neighborhood I would probably walk or bike up there pretty regularly based on the menu selection and because its a nice place to probably hangout, and to take advantage of the food specials.   Still the drink prices astonish me for a neighborhood tavern! Oh and for the record: I have had a better margarita for less many times over than this, this was a 2 star Rita. But for location, atmosphere, menu selection, staffing and decor I'll grant them 3 stars.   Check out the drink and food prices on their website before heading in if you have a budget. Remember to ask about specials before ordering, because it's likely you won't be informed otherwise.",

My first experience was just okay, I don't want to be entirely negative so I'll admit the veggie burger that I ordered on my first visit was really good and made in house. My experience today however will not likely secure a third visit. My friends arrived before me so luckily I didn't have to wait. I did however feel sorry for those who did since there's not really any \"waiting area\", people were standing in the entrance door trying to catch glimpses of the game. My beer was served warm which is a sin in my opinion, my pizza was very salty which made it hard to eat which sucked because I was hungry. The absolute worst part of this experience was the smell/smokiness - I felt like I was in a small room next to a gigantic deep fryer. I'm not sure if it was the location of our table or what??? I wasn't the only one that noticed it. It was unappetizing to say the least & I couldn't wait to get out of there. Not returning anytime soon.",

The service is always impeccable, the staff truly makes you feel like one of the family and they remember your favorites. It is a family friendly place but they do a nice job of keeping the kids entertained in the game area which is separated from the bar area where I prefer to hang. Great place to watch sports and share time with your friends!! The management and the owners have no problem mingling with their guests and making us feel so welcome and at home. Thanks to all of the Tav peeps for a fantastic place!",

I went here with my boyfriend since we live closeby and first the server asks what cocktails he can get us. It was Wednesday at 6pm and we were not about to order alcohol and it seemed like he was disappointed because of it. My boyfriend asked if they had Ginger Ale and he replied \"we can mix half Sprite and half Coke\".. Umm, I'm pretty sure that is NOT Ginger Ale, nor does it taste at all like it..  The server felt it necessary to make recommendations off the menu, he recommended about 15 different things. Still nothing was too appealing and another server came by to borrow ketchup and also stated that he could make recommendations. He recommended about 12 things and only one of them was the same as the first server. They both raved about the ribs so I ordered them. The server told me I had to get them with beans and coleslaw because they worked best. I told him I didn't like coleslaw and wanted frech fries and he almost didn't let me order what I wanted! He repeatedly tried to get me to order the beans and coleslaw instead of fries and cottage cheese LIKE I WANTED.. It was extremely annoying. The ribs were OK, nothing spectacular. Basically this place is OK, its clean and friendly but the staff is in your face and think they know best, whatever happened to \"the customer is always right?\". Let me order what I want!!!",

The service was slow, I am pretty sure our waitress had WAY too many tables.  I got the bacon blue burger and it was good, although they overcooked, I asked for medium and it was well.  My husband liked his southwestern wrap, until he picked up the second half and discovered a hair on the plate.  Once our waitress returned she immediately took it away and asked him if he wanted anything else, but at that point he lost his appetite.  They did take the $ off the bill.  It took our waitress at least 10 minutes to bring the check once we asked for it, then we paid partly with cash and partly with a card.  We instructed that she take the cash off the bill and put the rest on the card, she returns, cash gone, and full amount on the bill.  Now we stand around another 10 minutes waiting for her to return.  Finally get it all taken care of and get out of there. Definitely not someplace I would recommend or return to.  Maybe it is better during the week when they aren't as busy?",

On the menu, it says served with fries, tots, coleslaw or fruit is 1.95 extra. I got charged for the slaw. K tried the sampler platter. 3 wings that were in a super salty wing sauce that wasnt very tasty, 3 mozzarella sticks that were overcooked and hard and chicken tenders that had more breading than chicken. It says it comes with sliders online but when you get there, there are no sliders on the sampler. We had to ask for refills even though the server and manager came by and saw they were empty. How this place is even still open is beyond me. Everything was horrible. She brought us tots and onion rings even though we never ordered them and the tots tasted like old grease. Yuck.

I requested no cilantro and some was in the salad. And the mixed greens advertised were 2 pieces of mixed greens and a lot of romaine lettuce spines not the dark green romaine leaves that may have made it a little better. The dressing sounded exotic, Chardonnay vinaigrette, it was way to sweet.   In summary I found my lunch overpriced and undervalued.

Wanted a bit more to choose from than the menu at JT's just up the street (and they are not open for lunch!).  I know this place has changed hands a few times over the years and each new owner has brought a new level of mediocrity to the menu, draft beer offerings and service.  This most recent visit was for lunch and I was already giving it a second chance from a prior bad experience (it's Arcadia, it's in my neighborhood, how bad can it be?).  Well, it can't be much worse.  The menu has been drastically cut from what has been offered in the past.  Ordered the Tavern Club sandwich which came out very sloppily put together, even with the toothpicks trying to hold both sandwich halves together (BTW: isn't a club sandwich on 3 pieces of toast cut into quarters?).  I love tots so I opted for that as the side and they were so disgusting as to be inedible; tasted like bad grease; returned all but the 2 I tasted and didn't even get a \"I'll tell the cook\" or an apology.  Guess I should've realized something was off when I walked in and there was only one other person (at the bar, for lunch, on a Thursday!)  There are more than plenty of other options for myself and my neighbors to enjoy in the area; with more opening every day.  Want to patronize local but this current version of Arcadia Tavern needs to disappear?  Oh yeah, valet parking in a nearly empty parking lot!  I'll bet they're not happy with the new ownership either.",

One of my friends got a Tavern burger which was the largest sandwich I've seen. they said it was good, despite the mess. I have posted a pic of my wings.

So we had to have it moved so I could get to our car, I'm in a wheelchair. We had high hopes for the restaurant but we won't be back.",

There's valet and pretty much all of the surrounding business lots have posted signs letting you know that they do not want you parking in their lots to head over to Arcadia Tavern.  The atmosphere is a bit of a sports bar feel. There were a few TV's in the room where we were sat. Our server was Lauren. She was nice, attentive and made sure our needs were handled.  D & I both had the Blue Burger ($12.00). We both ordered the burger medium rare and both came closer to medium. My burger came topped with avocado, tomato, caramelized onion, bleu cheese crumbles & lettuce. I opted to leave the mayo off. I don't remember how D ordered his. My burger was good but really nothing all that special. I think for lunch, the price is a bit high.  S ordered the Reuben ($12.00). Sliced pastrami on sourdough w/ provolone and of course 1K island dressing. I would say S liked his sandwich because he was the first one done.  Parking is a hassle. Sports Bar feel. Good service. Good Food. Clean Facility. Prices a bit high for lunch. 3.5 Stars.",

This place has changed owners/management and boy can you ever tell!!  They need to get the old chef back or a chef who knows how to cook.  This place used to have the best sliced, fried dill pickles south of the Rio Grande.  Now, it's nothing but a grease ball, YUCK!!  We ordered the Dorito pizza that was mushy with a corn something or another crust (I don't even want to know what it is made of) and the steak salad, which was so tuff and we ordered it medium rare, that your jaw hurt just trying to chew the thing up.  The beer selection did not include Stella Artois and the substitute was allegedly a Pilsner, yet, it was the most bitter Pilsner I have ever tasted.  Put Stella back on draft, all of us Pilsner drinkers will thank you!  We won't be back until improvements have been made.  Thank you for not charging us for the food!!!  We went to Chick Filet after!!",

The waitress was okay, but she definitely brought one of our buddies the wrong beer. Since they come opened by the bartender, he didn't bother asking for the correct beer.

We did get it taken care of but to have the server tell us it wasn't free and not even check is not good in my book. Usually the staff is phenomenal and try to make it the best experience for you. So... I get the mass confusion, which was literally 4 inches off the plate. It was biscuits covered in gravy, tater tots and eggs. It was amazing!!! I was only able to eat a quarter of it but took the rest home to snack on the next day or so. I felt a little embarrassed at first but the next time I went back, people were ordering it all around me. I wanted to order it for a second time but decided to get the blueberry pancakes.

I was thrilled when Arcadia Tavern opened. Its a great spot for happy hour and a True bar with real bar food - love that. They didn't try to get all swanky with the menu. Your basic fries, wings, nachos and even spagehtti and meatloaf options. Take a look at the photo of the nachos I posted - SO GOOD. My husband and I have shared this plate of nachos for dinner more than once (don't judge me). The beers coming in giant schooners, the prices are good and they have a guy who places great sing-a-long acoustic guitar on a regular basis. Overall, a thumbs up for a non-stuff, neighborhood bar and restaurant.   Oh, and did I mention goldfish racing on Thursdays?",

    "text": "Great Sports Bar.  In Phoenix/Tempe for work and checked out a couple bars to watch the Laker, OKC, Miami, NY, Clipper games.  Aracadia Tavern quickly became our go to bar while we're in town.    Decor/layout:  4 It's a simple layout that works.  Multiple TV's on the walls and bar.  Not alot of other decoration to distract you.  Good spacing between tables and chairs never had to weave in and out to get to a table or restroom.  Nobody standing infront of the tables blocking TVs.  Great setup for watching a game and there was always a TV available for us to watch the games we wanted.  Service:  3.5 I've had great service everytime I've been here.  Drinks always refilled without prompting.  The only knock i give them is for when we're watching a late game, once or twice our server seem disappeared and/or left without telling us.  We had to find someone else to give us our bill.    Quality/taste: 3.5 Grilled wings tavern style are a must.  Delicious and meaty.  Great way to start a meal and the game.  First time we got them we had to get another order.  Now we usually get an order each when we go.  Big Azz Nachos were tasty.  A lot of food and a decent ratio of elements.  It's typical barfood.  Can't go wrong with that.   Prime Dip was just ok.  I wasn't a big fan, but wasn't the worst and wasn't the best beef dip i've had.  the prime rib had little taste the Au jus was like colored water and the meat wasn't piled on.  Very underwhelming.    Chef Rob's slow cooked ribs were pretty tasty.  The meat was soft and juicy.  The sauce had a good flavor and had a little bite to it and not to sweet.    Sweet Potato tater tots.  You can't go wrong with sweet tater tots.    Price: 3 Ok priced food and drinks.  Haven't taken advantage of some of their daily specials (there's a wine and pizza day and other specials).  But they look good.  My company was paying for my meals so i wasn't paying too much attention to the prices.  It's definitely not the cheapest bar food you can get, but for the quality you get you're not breaking the bank.      Misc:  4 Parking can get crowded there.  You may have to valet it.  For those that don't like leaving their keys with people this could be a big negative.  Late night Trivia games are fun.  They were always willing to accomadate us for the games we wanted to watch.",

We came for a quick bite and a few drinks after work and were pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere was good, drinks were reasonably priced and the food decent.  I had a pretzel with cheese sauce as I was missing Philly.  It was ok...you can't really compare to the pretzels I grew up on from the street vendors.

First off, they got rid of the best egg rolls I've ever had, but that was probably over a year ago. Nevertheless, we still came back because we liked it ( even though the egg rolls brought us and all of our friends in). So we moved on to the chicken tenders... They are almost $9 and you only got 4, but they were so good we still ordered them. Today we ordered them and we're absolutely disgusted. We got approx 4 ounces of chicken covered in fried bread. It was 75% bread. Once again, they downgraded and still kept prices the same. To top it off, my coors light was $7. I don't even know how you justify that. My favorite place turned into my most  unfavorite place so quickly.  Never going back!",

    "text": "Came in here today around happy hour for a beer, wasn't sure if I'd get anything else , so paid cash for the Hop Knot IPA. I should have gotten the tall blond girl who took my fiver to give me a receipt for it, because for the first time in my memory, a bartender \"forgot\" they were paid cash for a beer. And it wasn't like I went to settle up hours later. It was like a half hour later, after I'd ordered the pita and hummus plate that I went to settle up the check with the gal who'd taken over from blondie, and the Hop Knot is on the ticket.  \"Oh, no, I paid for the beer already.\"  \"Really? Hmmm, she said to charge you for it.\"  \"Yeah, I gave her a fiver. that's all paid up.\"  Really? Really??? Even though she quickly changed the ticket...there was that little questioning of me (and as a valued FIRST TIME customer?). Unbelievable. I told the manager \"Either your barmaid has the WORST MEMORY EVER, or she's deliberately scamming, and I'd keep an eye on her.\" Luckily Hector the manager was very receptive and kind in his response, (offering to buy me a beer next time I came in), or I'd really have to cut loose on this place. In nearly 20 years of bar-hopping I've never heard of pocketing cash and telling the relief bartender to write it down. Not unless that person is an outright scam artist on the outs with the place. Get a receipt for cash payments!  Anyway, pita and hummus plate wasn't bad. Not wild about the regular hummus (very bland), but the jalapeno and cilantro hummus....now you're onto something. Along with the marinaded tomato and cuke salad. Yummy. Worth $8 overall, methinks.   Even though they're trying to do the upscale neighborhood sports bar/restaurant thing, they are way overpriced, even for Arcadia (I agree with Erica's review), and the ambiance is lacking that certain inviting...je ne c'est quoi.   In short, I was hoping to like this place a lot more than I did, though bartender Jamie is sweet , and management accommodating. Maybe I'll give 'er another shot someday. I'm giving it 3 for Jamie's smile, great hummus platter, and Hop Knot in the goblet.  I'm going to start coming into places with a \"Beware - I'm a big Yelper\" T-shirt. Maybe that will get people to offer even passable service, or respect? Who knows.",

The grilled vegetable salad was amazing. The drinks were fairly strong, yet not over powering.   Everything was great. The only thing I could not stand was the music. But, that didn't detract from the experience. I'm just not a fan of country music. I will return.   To add; the service was great. Our server, Sunny was very nice and attentive.",

They have an area for kids which is right next to the bathrooms and an ATM machine.  Strange to see a \"kids\" area at a tavern for one thing.  But it was packed with a lot of elementary aged boys and one or two younger girls.  Hoping parents were watching them but the boys were getting pretty rowdy.  The little girl was quietly sitting on a chair with her little toy computer.  Two girls were playing with one girl climbing all over the ATM machine.  You see a lot when you stand in line with two other females with one bathroom stall... The place is crowded so there is valet parking.  We parked across the street at the shopping center and walked over.  Live band on Fridays.",

    "text": "After a day of packing to move, some friends (regulars of Arcadia Tavern) suggested going there for a bite to eat.  They requested a certain table since the kids were with.    Our server was LESS than ready to take care of our group.  We immediately told her there would be 3 checks if possible since there were 3 families at the table.  She said it wasnt a problem.  Well, we could not have been more specific when placing our orders, in fact, after taking one families order, she had to leave the table to put in the order. (ok, one adult salad and one kids spagetti) then she came to our family and we placed our order, again, back to put it that one order.  Finally the third family order (one adult appetizer and a beer).  That was the extent of the order. A runner brought out our food and we noticed one of the kids from our family was missing their meal.  Of course, the runner doesn't know so we have to wait for the server who was MIA.  Long story short, our drinks sat empty for most of the meal.  She seemed too busy to bother.  When the check came, the \"no problem\" of splitting the checks became a huge problem.  The 3 families became 2 and the meals among the 3 were all separated wrong.  We asked the server to come back over so we could correct it and she didnt seem to understand what the problem was.  I personally, took a pen and went as far as to place stars by all of our families stuff, checks for another family and dots for the third family.  Of course, she brought back the checks still incorrect, so we again had to help her.  Finally, the checks came and we were missing an item, but she didnt seem to care, (maybe the free beer was a consolation gift).    We felt the food was good. The pricing was decent, however, the fact that the server could care less about us,  left a very bad taste in my mouth and therefor would prevent me from choosing to go there in the future.",

The service, however, is still very lacking if it is at all busy (like during Sunday football).   I am a server and I have worked in a busy sports bar before so I understand the challenges of serving in this style of restaurant, but the consistency of the poor service is cause for concern. Sit at the bar if you can find room and the service is much better. They also have a $5 off your bill offer with a yelp check in.",

The parking can be an issue at times because of the tiny lot, but the valet is quick and I don't mind throwing a kid a few bucks to park my hoopty.    The service is usually friendly and reliable, but what keeps me coming back is the food.  I was always really surprised with their American bar fare because it just tasted so damn good.  That was until I found out why.  I met the Chef one day and came to find out that he is a product of Houston's.  I'm sure most people don't know this but everything is made in house from scratch (and I mean everything).  Even the dressing are home made.  That turkey club you just ate came from a turkey breast that they roasted in back and portioned on the meat slicer - same with the roast beef.    I'm a foodie and I love to cook so I really appreciate a place that does it right.   The prices are reasonable for a neighborhood joint and the quality is outstanding.  The half-roasted chicken is a must have and the ribs are a no-brainer (Houston's anyone?).  Just about everything on the menu is worth a try.  Give it a go, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "The Mrs. and I were heading to Scottsdale and we (I) needed a place to watch the Spain vs. Paraguay match.  AZcentral mentioned this as a great place to watch the World Cup....and they were right!  We could have watched synchronized swimming here and we still would have had fun.  We got there just as they were opening and picked a prime spot at the bar.  Actually, we could have sat anywhere and had a prime spot.  Kudos to whoever feng shuied the TVs in!  This is the best set up I have even seen for a sports bar.  You feel like you are on top of any tv you want to watch.    There is even a place to dump your kids ( I mean a place for your kids to play)! They have cool Wii stations ready for a bunch of chicken finger- eating hooligans to enjoy.  Being that it was brunch, we ordered a spicy Bloody Maria & Bloody Mary( the mrs. doesn't do tequila) and started off with some chips & salsa with a side of guac.   The salsa was surprisingly good and so was the guac.  Both WAY above typical sports bar fare.   The bartender was super cool, super cute, and a super drink maker!  What more can you ask for?  The bar wasn't busy, but there were a handful of World Cup fans that lent a fun atmosphere.   Our bloodies came in these huge goblets and it took most of the half for us to finish them.  We scored with those suckers!  Half time gave us a chance to order.  We were not overly hungry due to the meal of a drink we had and of course all the chips.  Ended up splitting a Phoenix Philly.  Again, we were delighted with our order.  The sandwich was awesome!   Recommendation: Get the side of cottage cheese with diced jalepenos.  I could have eaten a quart of that!  Rounded out the second half with a couple of beers.  They have pretty much anything you might want either on tap or in bottle.  Our visit left us wishing we lived in Arcadia....within walking distance to this place.",

    "text": "Meh.  I was really excited to try this place out. I saw that they had ballpark pretzels so I was psyched! When we arrived there were no parking spots, so we had to go across the street to Safeway and walk over. Not that big of a deal.   We were seated right away. I liked that they had big booths and the picnic tables were fun.   Our waitress couldn't have cared less that we were there. We even told her it was our first time there and she didn't even welcome us or tell us anything about the place.  We ordered the ballpark pretzel to start. I wasn't impressed with it at all. Its more bread like, very fluffy, not like a ballpark pretzel in the slightest. The cheese dipping sauce that came with it was underwhelming. Total bum out.  Our meals came pretty quickly. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad, it was good. I liked the dressing and the fact that it was shaved chicken. I really liked the tortilla strips in it (though that's more like for a taco salad?) Overall it was a decent salad, they could use better quality lettuce in it, it seemed to be mostly iceberg.   My husband got the prime dip with a side of onion rings. He said the sandwich was just ok, not terrible but not memorable either. The onion rings were a joke. They had zero taste and honestly tasted like the onion rings that you buy in the freezer section of the grocery store. We each ate one and then he took the rings off his plate and set them off to the side. No one wanted to eat them. I actually asked the waitress if the onion rings were made FRESH, she said yes, I said really because they taste like they came out of the freezer, she said, welllll ummmmm ya I think they are frozen. NOT cool to lie to customers.   My mother in law got the fish and chips. The fish was actually pretty decent, I stole a bite. However, once again frozen run of the mil french fries and the coleslaw was not edible.   When the bill came I noticed they charged us $1 for the horrible onion rings. I told my husband and when the waitress came back he asked her why. As I had said previously, we had told her it was our first time, when she asked him what side he wanted he said he didn't know what they were so she listed them off for him and did not tell us that the onion rings were a \"premium\" side dish and were extra. Seriously it is only a $1 and we wouldn't have even made a deal out of it if they would have actually been edible. So we asked her if she could take the $1 off as they were terrible and we didnt eat them and we weren't even told they were extra. She sends the manager over, seriously. To take a $1 off. He told us he could take the $1 off or give us a free dessert. We went with the $1 off as we were all ready to get out of this place. He didnt even ask why.  So there you have it. Its a cool looking place, looks like they have a nice patio. The food is underwhelming. For 3 dinners, 2 beers and an app our bill was about $64.   Would I go back here on my own? No. Would I go back here if some one asked me to join them? No.",

Last time I was here our server was MIA for a significant period of time, and when he did come back he seemed as if he had been smoking something out back. However he did still get our order right, so that was impressive.   I have eaten here dozens of times, and if you want to eat something decent I suggest the arcadia club sandwich with tater tots, hummus and chicken, or a salad. They also have a pretty good cookie skillet with ice cream if you have a sweet tooth. Other than that the food is less than mediocre, so stay safe and order the above mentioned.   This is a fun place if you want to watch a game, have a drink, and eat some fried goodies, but for decent food I recommend going elsewhere.",

There was one golf video game wedged in the corner by the bar. That would have been ok but the food wasn't great either. There was a kid menu which was ok, kids aren't picky. My salad that was supposed to have grilled chicken came with what looked like chopped lunch meat. My partners burger was meh as well as fries. I wouldn't go back except to have a drink and watch a game without kids. I will say service was good.",

The brews are fresh and OSHO has a nice variety of beers. I have been here only a few times, but each was enjoyable.  Outdoor section adds another 60+ patrons and breathe in some open air.   FOOD- I would rate \"Above Par\".  Good flavor, wings & yummy sandwiches. For the Price, is a fair meal.  Good spot to connect with Fam and Friends.  Definitely be Back for more.",

    "text": "I used to rave about this place when people visited Phoenix because of the environment and sliders.  First, the sliders began going downhill.  I cut them some slack because they no doubt had new cooks.  However, my experience yesterday with their service has made me question on ever returning to arcadia tavern.  I would just like to say shame on you arcadia tavern ownership and management for making the asu/uofa football game experience the worst i have ever had.  Some may point to the rude servers for causing their experience to be bad, but I completely understand your servers lack of table management when you are way understaffed and your employees are not trained to handle high volume.  This points to leadership.  Especially when the manager on duty is not willing to talk with customers.  We actually received more help from a restaurant \"regular\" then we did from actual employees.  Just plain sad.   Their nachos are still delicious, which is why they at least get two stars.  But arcadia tavern you need to step up your game if you ever want this local, and my friends who were in attendance, to ever recommend your bar/restaurant again.",

They have them here but it's 22$, you would have to have about 5 mimosas to make the bottomless mimosas worth it. I just got one mimosa, but what intrigued me was the big Bloody Mary bar! There were a variety of things to put in your Bloody Mary. My favorites were the pickled asparagus and the tiny onions. When you order it, they give you a glass of vodka and ice, and you're supposed to get the Bloody Mary mix at the bar. I was a noob, honestly, but there is a method to making your Bloody Mary. They provide shakers, so I would pour your vodka in the shaker, and salt your rim of your glass, make your Bloody Mary, pour it into your glass and add the fixings, I had done it the opposite way, and it didn't work as well, haha.  For entree, I ordered the mass confusion? It was so good, but too big! I suggest sharing with another person. The tater tots were crispy and I loved the sausage gravy. I will be back. They also have a patio area for when the weather is nice.",

My first time trying Truffle Fries- they were BOMB! My friend that was with me has had them before and said they were awesome. She tried the new Western Burger and loved it- I had the cheeseburger sliders. Sliders were so good- fresh soft buns- the burger was fresh and had great flavor and the grilled onions made it even better. Side of crispy onion rings and a cold beer- what more could you want?! Tyler was our server and took great care of us! Great personality and quick to get us what we wanted. Highly recommend this place any day of the week!!",

Moscow mules tasted watered down and I'm not kidding, like pond water. We ordered a cheeseburger and the french dip, both dry.

The atmosphere is very relaxed for a sports bar. Parking can be a pain at times when there's a big game. In fact, a friend and i had to go somewhere else simply because there was no parking. There's a nice patio with great seating, but it is right next to a main road which can make a conversation a bit difficult. However, they do have a good amount of televisions outside.   Pricing on food is decent and drinks can be really affordable too since they have good specials. Service as well can be a bit better. I've had to go up and ask if there was someone available to assist with ordering. I suppose it depends on your definition of \"long wait\" is but i like to think of myself as a patient person.   What brings me back is the location, drink specials and patio.",

We didn't have time to wait for a whole new order, but I did let the sever know it was unacceptable. The manager came out to advise me how hard it was to make a well done hamburger that wasn't burnt.

We also found them offering service, in our case from a woman named Deanna that was far from ideal as items were forgotten or delivered to the wrong table while water refills were non-existent.  Loud and boisterous, particularly the large group of Steelers fans in the other half of the restaurant, I actually enjoyed the setting at Arcadia while the food, mostly, was competent with the pizza falling flat due to a flavorless crust and underwhelming cheese while the trio of bruschetta were simple but well prepared with good ingredients on crisp yet toothsome bread.  Moving on to better things, the pulled pork was actually a highlight; meltingly tender on buttery little rolls and spiced without being spicy.  Equally good, the pretzel was golden, buttery, and plenty to share (without the ridiculous upcharge for cheese like the average pretzel at Brat Haus) while the dessert cookie was exactly what you'd expect - still scalding hot in the skillet and crispy atop with a near-pudding consistency within, the flavors buttery and tinged with cinnamon plus a lot of semi-sweet chocolate chips - a great comfort food classic, though the ice cream was mere carton quality and did the dish no favors.    Better than BW3s, for sure, and actually pretty good by sports bar standards I'd consider going back, though I'd love to know when the nebulous breakfast/brunch ends since no one on the phone could tell me (I hear 12:00 from some, 2:00 from others, though we arrived at 11:50) and I'd skip the coffee - and pray for better service.",

Parking was a nightmare because the parking lot is tiny and they make you valet, but we went and parked at the Safeway parking lot and just walked over.  When we got closer, there was music blasting and the reason why was there was a band out on the patio. It. Was. LOUD.  When we got in, they said there was a15-25 minute wait, OR we could sit outside on the patio and have our eardrums blown out. We waited.  We got a table after 25-30 minutes and it took a bit for our server to come by, but we had enough time to figure out what we wanted to so by the time she did come by we were ready to go.   Our food was very good (burgers and tater tots), however we felt it was a bit pricy. We got a Groupon for $10 for $20, but when we got the bill plus what we paid for the groupon it was still $32 with tax and my fiance only got 1 beer, meaning it would have been $40-$50 normally for 2 burgers with sides and 1 beer.  They even had a kids play section with Wii games and toys which was nice to see (even though we don't have any kids).  Our experience was pretty good overall and we may come back in the future...maybe.",

The sandwich held together nicely and the regular tater tots were as good as those things can be. So, why am I deducting a star, well it's because of the owner. He seems to call everybody \"buddy\". It is fairly annoying to me to be called buddy by someone who is seating me and doesn't know me at all. I realize there is a number of ways to refer to someone and this a casual place, but buddy is not one of them. All you should do is say, \"how many for dinner?\" He even tried to clean the plates off the table by saying, \"you finished with that buddy\" and also \"sure I can turn the game on for you buddy. After awhile it was pretty comical. Maybe a drinking game can be invented with this guy - ya know, take a chug when he invokes the \"buddy\" line, but don't drive home cause you will get drunk with that game.   Oh yeah, cool board games also, but our waitress was sitting at the table in front of us and hanging out at that table in-between serving our food. A bit bizzarre in Arcadialand.",

    "text": "Had a Living Social coupon for Arcadia Tavern and anxious to try it out. The place was packed - of course it was a Friday after work so this was to be expected. After about 20 minutes, we were seated and the waitress came by and asked if we wanted our drinks refreshed (well, yes!!) Both the wine and the whiskey were generous pours [smile]. What we didn't realize was that Arcadia Tavern is basically a sports bar kicked up a notch or two. Not that that's bad - just was a surprise.  The food isn't your basic sports bar food either. That too, has been kicked up a couple of notches - no jalapeno poppers or potato skins on the menu!!! Yea! I asked the waitress what type of bread/roll the chicken caprese sandwich came on and was told it was an \"artisian\" roll. Guess my interpretation of that is different as it seemed like a plain white hamburger bun to me. In any event, the sandwich was good and the chicken was moist. The Phoenix Philly was very good - great flavor and just the right amount of heat. The waitress was pretty much MIA - brought our food - sped by once, and then again to drop off the bill.   The place was LOUD - crazy LOUD! Our table was right by the door and it was obvious that a number of the people coming in knew some of the other patrons - obviously a lot of regulars.   There is an outside seating area - in nice weather it might be nice, but we noticed there was a city bus stop right out front - not so sure I'd want to side outside with all the car fumes and city bus fumes, too.  Good food, decent prices, generous pours on the drinks, LOUD atmosphere (did I mention that already??), energetic vibe. I think we'll try it again - and when you check in on Yelp - you get a coupon for $5 off your bill!!!",

We ordered a beer and a sprite and 2 waters. We had to ask twice for our waters to be refilled, as well as the sprite, she never asked if i wanted another drink, and never ONCE checked on our meal. She never apologized for ringing the wrong order or for someone else running the correct food. Seemed completely disinterested. I dont know if she was mad that she had to work Valentine's day or if there is some other issue, but i have worked in the hospitality industry for 18 years as everything from a dish washer, to general manager and this was the absolute worst service that i have ever encountered. Im generally pretty easy to deal with and dont require much more from a server other than general attentiveness and at least faking that u want to be there. Didnt get either. Best advice n i can give is save your time and money and go across the street to OHSO.",

If I am asked to watch sports with a friend or my boyfriend, I'd prefer to do it in an atmosphere that is well-maintained, well-staffed with friendly and professional employees, has ample flat screens with a selection of games on, and includes a veggie burger (albeit not the best in town) on the menu.  2). This is both a family-friendly place and an establishment that is fun for a couple of hours if I'd rather just go out with my boyfriend or a friend for a drink or two. There aren't all that many places in the Arcadia area that share this quality.   Yay.  :-D",

    "text": "I hate to write bad reviews, but have to do it based on recent experiences with Arcadia Tavern.  We live within walking distance of the Tavern.  We visit on average 2-3x month, typically more during Arcadia Little League season, after games and practices, as we would typically go with our kids and several other families.  They had a great kids play area on the southwest corner of the restaurant.  The kids area was a driving force for many families with young kids looking for a family friendly restaurant in the Arcadia area.    To comply with ADA regulations ownership needed to add ADA compliant restrooms, which is completely understandable, and the only location available was the kids area - totally get this and respect ownerships position to make this change to be in compliance.  My issue with the restaurant is their extremely negative response to those long standing customers who voiced their opinion about the loss of the kids area.  The business website states \"Our focus remains on being a neighborhood family friendly establishment and we are working to better improve the overall experience and service for the community we serve.\"  In a recent Facebook thread, ownership stated that families with kids who cant sit quietly at a table should visit Dave & Busters or Chuck e Cheese, rather than visit the Tavern as it is a \"restaurant bar, not a play date.\"  Point taken and we will gladly take our business elsewhere.  Note that the kids area was a 10 foot x 10 foot area in the back corner of the restaurant.  As the majority of people who sat in this section were families it will be interesting to see the transition into who now sits there.      Bummer, as we really enjoyed going to Arcadia Tavern over the past several years.  With an average bill for our family alone of $60 to $70, multiplied by the 3-4 other families with us, equating to a total turn of $200 to $300 per visit, this equates to a decent amount of revenue over the course of a year (just for our group alone).  Several other families in the neighborhood have stated they will not be visiting the Tavern based on their response.  So sad to see.      Ownership states that a future west side patio extension will likely include an outside play area for kids.  That is good to hear, but unfortunately the majority of family customers will have likely moved on to a different establishment and likely wont give the Tavern a second chance.  Too bad.",

I didn't realize how close the street was to the patio (bushes blocked view) you an hear all the cars at the light and passing by. Not a big deal for us but it your someone who doesn't like that I'd sit inside. Our waiter was a trainee and he was very polite and working hard. He was being assisted by the bartender I believe. She was nice also and helpful. The food was good. My husband had the hangover burger and my son had the fish and chips. I had the fried chicken sandwich. All were good, however not great. If there restaurant had been any busier I'm not sure our food would have come out as good. The menu doesn't say it but the jalapeno cream cheese they add to the chicken sandwich is very very hot. I can tolerate spicy but this was very spicy even to me. The pricing was okay and about average. I didn't understand why they listed it with games and such for kids. There were none. Try it out if you want casual bar like food. This is not a place for fancy eaters!!!",

My husband and I wanted to take our pooch to lunch on a Sunday afternoon and Arcadia Tavern is walkable from our house + allows dogs on their patio. Yes, please! We need a break from OHSO every once in a while!   We hadn't eaten here in a few months and SO MANY THINGS have changed! They basically cut their menu in half or even a quarter and unfortunately removed all of the dishes that we LOVED! I'll miss the Caprese Salad with grilled artichokes so much! I honestly came here for that salad. But oh well, I can branch out so I ordered their Tavern Salad with chicken (tossed in buffalo sauce) and ranch. Well friends, the entire salad was drenched (and I mean DRENCHED) in buffalo sauce and they put ranch on the side. Like what chef does this??! I asked for the chicken only to be buffalo, not the entire salad, let alone dripping in it. I could barely eat it and for a $16 salad, this totally bummed me out. Also, I don't think the ranch is homemade anymore. WAHHHH! It was not good.  Now you're probably wondering why I didn't send the salad back? Well, we were starving when we got there and the service was SO SLOW (and we were one of 3 tables on the patio). My husband got his beer AFTER our food came and we ordered it way before. So by the time it came, I was pretty darn hangry and ate it anyway. We had also asked the hostess to turn off the heater and turn on the TV by us but that never happened.   All in all, it was just such a bummer experience and I can honestly say we won't be back. Prices are SO high, food quality went way down, and service was slow despite the restaurant being wide open. For two of us to eat lunch (2 entrees, 1 Coors Light, and 1 iced tea) our bill was $50. This totally makes me sad since we live blocks away and it is a convenient spot to bring our pup. Oh well!",

If I'm being honest, we were actually trying to go to O.H.S.O. down the street, but it was already almost 8p and there was a 40 minute wait there. I was about to pass out from hunger or eat my hand at that point (lol), so we decided to check out Arcadia Tavern instead.  Luckily, this turned out to be a really great choice! I'm not sure if it's always like this or if the Tavern normally has an earlier crowd, but when we came it was really empty, and we were seated right away. Our waiter was very friendly and efficient, so we were able to order fairly quickly, and I was able to not die from hunger.   I will say that their beer selection isn't the best, but they have a decently wide variety, and I know my fiance and I can sometimes be picky. I started with the San Tan Devil's Ale, which was good, and my fiance got the Moscow Mule. He said it was good and very strong, so at least we got our money's worth! He also later got a Stella, but that was a bit stale.  For dinner I got the Fish n' Chips, and it was so good! The portions were really big - four good sized pieces of well seasoned fish, though it could have been a little crispier, really tasty fries, and delicious coleslaw (it's hard to find good coleslaw, and I like when places put kale in their coleslaw lol). My fiance got the Hangover Burger, which he said was really good, just a little messy!   A lot of the other reviews said that Arcadia Tavern was overpriced, but we really didn't think so! It seemed very average, exactly what we would normally pay for two entrees and drinks :)",

This place was empty at that time and stayed empty for the first hour we were there. On a Friday during happy hour! Should have been a clue.  Our server was slow and it almost seemed as if we had two servers, or one that was helping the other because every time something went wrong, this backup server showed up to pop off about how she got a bad tip from a previous large table for not being able to split the bill and was trying to help. She was of no assistance at allllll.  I've served. I get it; big parties suck! I just feel like we didn't move at all and I would have aligned seat numbers like normal to be able to give separate checks. Either way, split bill was a mess, food was mediocre and service was blah. We were there for about three hours when we should have been there for max, two. Not somewhere I'd recommend.",

Bathrooms are extremely clean, but there is no service. Hostess brought is waters, but no server - ever. Busboy came by and cleaned off three other tables, not noting the fact we where still sitting there with no service. After 17 mins waitress finally stopped by the table next to us, made eye contact with us then promptly scurried away without saying a thing. Next time she walked near, we tried again to get her attention, and she walked away again. At least the hostess thanked us for coming in and sitting for 20 mins. I would understand if the place was busy, but about 60-70% of the tables were empty...",

    "text": "We used to frequent this place as it was a reliable alternative to your typical sports bar, with a thoughtful menu and fairly upscale atmosphere.  Because we have moved away from the neighborhood, we haven't been in awhile.  Nevertheless, while passing through the area today, we decided to visit the old stomping grounds and enjoy the always delicious roasted chicken and, my wife, the veggie burger. We were very disappointed to find a new and unimpressive menu offering typical (and mostly fried) \"bar food\".    The impression of Arcadia Tavern in my mind has always been one of separation from the norms of your average sports bar with stale beer, greasy fries and chicken wings, to one of crafted food, fresh ingredients, interesting beer selections and great service.   While our service was still fantastic and very friendly, I'm sorry to say that it still didn't keep us in the building as the menu so severely lacked anything to keep us enticed that we drank our beers and left.    I hope to return again in the future, but with so very many other options in the vicinity, Arcadia Tavern will seriously need to step up its game before we'll return. :(",

I sat at the bar to have a drink and an appetizer while I was waiting for my haircut.  I had 45 minutes, so I thought that was plenty of time... it wasn't.  There is one blonde \"hot\" bartendress who is obviously not hired for her skills.  It took me 10 minutes to get my menu and water and then another 15 of trying my hardest to get her attention to put in my order.  The food came quickly and it was delicious... but this girl spent half of the time talking to two guys at the end of the bar and the other half on her cell texting.  By the end I was standing with cash in my hand to try to get to my haircut on time.    They also short-change you.  My bill was $10.27 and I gave them a $20.  She gave me $9 back... I feel cheated because she kept my $.73 as a tip... she didn't deserve that at all.  PS.  This is not my first time, I've given this place many chances and fortunately there are some places close by finally where I can take my money and tip elsewhere!",

Only had one bad experience here where my waitress kept forgetting only my drink out of everyones at the table. Oh well she ended up comping me 3 beers. It was a win win situation I guess. Other than that. Great sports place.",

    "text": "I would have given this 3 stars up until the other night only because the food is good, atmosphere is good and you can bring your family there.  I noticed they raised the prices by a lot!  A burger is $12.  If you want their \"famous\" tater tots, it is now $2 more!!!  It is $15 for a Philly Cheesesteak!  Don't forget, if you want tater tots, that comes to $17!!!  ABSURD!  They raised the kids meals to $6.  If you go during Happy Hour, that only applies if you are sitting on the bar side, not the restaurant side.  And you are forced to valet park unless you want to walk a ways from the Safeway parking lot caddy corner.  My boyfriend dreads it when one particular bartender is working because she always appears to be annoyed when you ask for something.  Half the time the service is good but the other half the time, slow, forgetful and too busy.  One final observation, they are a Saints bar ... very uncomfortable on football days.",

I bit into the burger and instead of a dry lifeless burger i bit into a 30-70 to a 20-80 burger that just had its delicious flavor pouring out from the first bite till the last. and It isn't on some random bun its on a beautifully fresh bun(kaiser i believe)  the tots...amazing because....sweet potato tots...whats not to love about this?? oh the fact that they were crisp and not mushy...yes to LOVE! how about the fact that it wasnt a greasy glob..YES LOVE!!!!!   in short great pub to hang and watch any of the countless games with friends, great restaurant for the food.....together...the ultimate game night destination...

At best:  a bunch of disinterested young kids sitting around BSing or wandering around inanely doing their best not to pay attention to you.  At worst:  kind of snotty youngsters who seem genuinely put out/angry that you would dare to ask them for service.  The folks at the bar seem to have the best luck getting responses--maybe because the bartender can't \"escape\" and wander around like the rest of them?  When the manager is there, there is a \"slight\" improvement; when he is not, they'll let you walk in and wander around without offering to help.  They don't seem to understand that they are running a business--I honestly get the impression that they think they are being paid to \"hang out\" and anything that gets in their way of doing that (ie: customers) is best ignored/avoided.  Not going back!!!",

We went on a Friday night at 7 and was glad that there was an open table. We had the pita & hummus and split the rocky point burger, both were delicious. I gave them 2 stars because of the atmosphere. I understand it's a sports bar and can be loud, but one of the servers was in on her day off I'm assuming and brought your small child in..fine...but we could have done without the yelling and high pitched screaming/baby talk. They acted like no one else was there and several tables seemed annoyed with it. It definitely ruined our experience and am surprised management allowed it to go on as long as it did. At one point they were so loud, all of the tables looked over. I would think you would behave a little more maturely at your place of employment but guess I'm wrong. We had to listen to it the ENTIRE meal. Even thinking about it now is making me angry, real mature!",

I never have to wait, the staff is always having a good time, and they keep the beers coming! Parking is tight, but the complimentary valet makes up for it. There is a little area for children that is tucked away, always odd to see kids at a bar, but Arcadia does a good job at keeping them away from the bar area so families can come in for a bite to eat.  I would highly recommend this place as a great bar to watch games at, grab some great food (not the average bar fare) or to just hangout and enjoy a few adult beverages. Two thumbs up!",

The food is pretty amazing (you've gotta try the grilled wings), the beer selection is fantastic and they make a mean (and huge) margarita. The service is usually good, though can be hit or miss when they are really busy. I think the only things that could be better about this place are the parking situation* (valet fills up fast and the closest backup option is the Safeway parking lot across the intersection) and the bathroom situation (the restrooms are on the \"family\" side of the restaurant, opposite from the bar so it's a long walk). But we consider this our go-to Sunday bar and have also come for dinner and trivia during the week.   *If you live close, there is plenty of beach cruiser parking.",

The brunette hostess at the door was the best thing, she was friendly and greeted us and knew which group I was looking for--she gets 5 stars!   I was a little surprised at the pricing in the menu, but assumed that for that price, my meal should rock. I got the 48th St. Salad with the walnuts, cranberries, applies, blue cheese, etc. I get some variation of that salad lots of places, so I am a pretty good judge of it. It had something that was cinnamon in it, which kind of overwhelmed the taste and didn't quite belong. Someone next to me got something else and said theirs had cinnamon too. They didn't  like it either. I love cinnamon, but not on certain things. I did try the onion rings which were okay.   It looks like a cute place with jersey's hanging high on the ceiling--good atmosphere for a beer. Lots of neighbors were there. Work on the food a little more or lower the price, so I lower my expectations. A nice choice of draft beers too. No one at my table raved about their food.

    "text": "I would first like to say that the service is great. I sat at the bar on a Friday afternoon while waiting for my Scottsdale \"tour guide\" to get his hair cut next door. The bartender talked with me for a good thirty (maybe even forty-five) minutes. (She had other people to tend to, but always came back to finish our conversations.) I really appreciated the friendly service and the great chats. I feel like a jerk for not remembering her name because she was so nice to me.   That being said, I'll get on to the real portion of the review: the booze and the food.  I had two Dragon's Bites (a great recommendation from the bartender). Rum, cranberry juice, another booze, magic, and lychee juice. Delicious. Not worth the $9 price tag, but good drinks nonetheless. in Austin, I think it would have been more along the lines of $7 a drink. But, I'm not in Austin. I'm in the greater Phoenix area, so nine bucks it is. In all honestly, I'm a lush. I drink too many sweet drinks and my bar tab gets too high. I hear there is a decent happy hour here, so I will have to go back. I really want to try the rest of the mix drinks. They looked so good! Sadly, at 2 PM on a Friday afternoon, there is no happy hour.   They had a few beers on tap (Stella, some locals, and some bigger names) and they had a ton of bottled beers. I'm coming back for the Purple Haze.  Decent wine list. Nothing fantastic, but not limited. Lots and lots of Napa wines. (Yes, yes. I know. This is Arizona, which is right next to California... But I like Washington and Oregon wines)  The food was meh. In fact, I think I got sick from the food. But, it was my fault. I ordered the fish and chips. Pipping hot and served with malt vinegar, tartar sauce, and cocktail sauce on the side. (Yummy french fries! My weakness!) I think my fault was ordering fish in a place that does not have sand covering the ground outside and the restaurant's floor inside. This food sickness has happened to me before and I need to remember to order fish only when I can see the ocean from my seat.  Overall, an A-OK place and I will have to try the happy hour menu.",

And while it was good - it wasn't great. Any side other than fries is an additional $2. I had fruit salad which was basically two halves of a frozen orange and a grape.    Parking is pain. they offer valet. But, it's annoying to watch the valets park in the few available spots even though they have a parking agreement across the street. Leave the few available spots for self parking customers. Especially when the line to valet is out on Indian School. I can't get my child out of his car seat fast enough for that.",

Give me a day of the week and it's likely I will be able to list of 3 or more booze specials going on in any given area at any given time.  This is not because I'm cheap. This is because I'm a lush.  My bar tab is going to be high, no matter how much the drinks cost, so just get me as drunk as possible and you will be rewarded handsomely.  That said, I was super stoked to find out that after ditching our former trivia location, we were going to give Arcadia Tavern a try for their Tuesday Night Trivia.  Partially because trivia is super fun. And partially because, upon doing my due diligence, I learned that not only are Tuesday nights $20 Wine and Pizza Night, but they also offer 1/2 Price Any Bottle of Wine Mon-Thurs from 9 PM- Close!  Guess what day is in between Monday and Thursday? TUESDAY! It's like I hit the booze special lottery!   Upon sitting down we immediately got our wine and pizza on.  This special is not nearly as awesome as Postino's $20 Bruschetta and a Bottle deal, also on Tuesday nights. For one, only 2 bottles of wine are offered, whereas Postino gives you a choice of ANY FREAKING BOTTLE OFF THEIR MENU.  Secondly, it's limited to one per table. So if there's 4 of you and you're all a little hungry and a lot thirsty and would like to split 2 pizzas and a couple bottles of wine, you only get to use the special once. Kinda lame, but I guess I understand (though Postino does not limit you whatsoever, and that is why I love them).  So we start trivia, eat our pizza, drink our wine, have a couple beers and 9:00 rolls around . We grab our waitress and ask if we can begin partaking in the excellent half-price bottle special they have going on Mon-Thurs from 9:00 PM to close.  We were told that no, we could not.  We apparently already used our special for the day when we ordered the Pizza and Wine special. This perplexed us.  When you go to a restaurant for happy hour. And then, say, happy hour turns into happy 4 hours and you happen to still be at the restaurant by time their nightly specials kick in, do you not get to partake in both? And do you not call it a Happy Booze Sandwich?  Ok maybe you don't, considering I just made that term up, but I doubt anyone has ever been denied cheap booze on account of previously imbibing cheap booze at the same establishment.   We also wondered if we shot ourselves in the foot ordering the pizza and wine deal at 7:00 PM when we could have waited until 9 and had half price bottles ALL NIGHT LONG. We asked the waitress and apparently we did not, because in Arcadia Tavern world \"Half Price Bottles of Wine from 9PM to Close\" really means \"One Half Price Bottle of Wine per Table from 9PM to Close\".  WTF? How they expect to compete with any other special at that time with this lame ass promotion is beyond me. We have Vig down the street with $5 martinis, Postino with $20 Bruschetta and a Board. Hell, even Zipps will give you $3 premium pints from 8PM to close and this is AFTER lubing you up with $3 Zipparitas from 3-7.  Basically, I was fully planning on putting Arcadia Tavern in constant rotation on my weekly booze session calendar, but they clearly can't handle it. I've been here a couple time and the food and service has always been okay, so I guess I'll give them 3 stars. But I'm still going to the Vig on Tuesdays.",

TVs were like wallpaper but for a sports bar, I guess that's what you want. But LOUD - come expecting to watch a game, at least on a Sunday when we were there.

    "text": "Moved to the area recently as was looking for a local spot to frequent with tvs, drink specials and good food. I had driven by this place a few times and popped in one day. I ordered the hangover burger topped with a runny fried egg. Hit the spot! They also serve 18oz drafts $4 ($3.50 during HH). Can't beat that. And their food specials during HH are well discounted compared to their regular menu. The staff is fun and friendly. A place where you can get to know your bartender(s).   There is a seated section on the other side of the restaurant w/ booths and tvs along the walls. I've actually never sat down on that side and it can get full during big games. My only caveat is it just seems that many families come there to eat. More than few young children can be found roaming around. Maybe its just me but in the Northeast, you wouldn't find kids in a sports bar. Hence the 4 stars..I just stick to the bar and patio side.   All in all not a bad place to grab a bottomless beer and a burger during HH at good prices.   Bonus: They're a Red Sox bar!",

The waitresses were dressed in cliche outfits that the masses of dumb old men like. The food was mediocre. My SO had the corned beef and cabbage and thought it was amazing, a generous portion and seasoned just right. I had a buffalo chicken sandwich that was just average. It was dry and tasteless for the most part. The fries served on the side were cold. I was lucky to see my waitress to ask for extra pickles let alone any extra buffalo sauce for my sticky sandwich. More than once a busser and other servers tried to take our plates before we were even finished. We certainly didn't feel rushed. We were over charged for happy hour drinks but it took so long to get our waitresses attention we just wanted to pay and leave. The parking is horrendous and I feel slightly frustrated when you are pretty much required to use \"complimentary\" valet. Go across the street to OHSO.",

Picnic bench seating and an entertainment area for the kids. - Good food selection for a tavern - Friendly hosts, valets and wait staff - Excellent bus boy (server?) saw a little disappointment cross my face, asked me what it was and fixed it  Weak - very, very poor value for the money, we did have 1 dessert but I don't think I've ever spent $100 for lunch with my wife and 3 small children.  Maybe if my burger had come with more than 5 onion rings at an additional $2 fee, I would have felt there was more value. - there was a sign up in the restaurant saying there were specials all day and even included that day's date, but our waitress new nothing about it.  She said she'd ask about it, but never brought it up again and by the end of the meal we had to run out - no email address on website for me to send my comments in privately",

    "text": "Arcadia Tavern, I have been enjoying dinner at your place for quite some time.  Over a year I have been coming over to your place, not only for the great atmosphere of being a kid friendly sports bar, but also for those greasy burgers and delicious sweet potato tots.  Seriously, those things are so addictive my family and I count out how many each person gets so everyone has the same amount and there aren't any fights.  Then, as if you cant get any better, you start showing up on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flocaldines.com&s=44689ffbbadab9be38206aa335aa787759c7197a53ff8df410bddcc90d94af48\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">localdines.com</a> and <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgroupon.com&s=dddd6d4a067849d455557df3f740429e9a4df76571dab2a2356ac944fa74372c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">groupon.com</a>.  Holy cow, I can come to your place for 1/2 price?  AWSOME!!!  But then, you start becoming a crappy host.  The last few months you have screwed up my order nearly every time I go.  Seriously, I write down on a piece of paper what I want on my burger (make it very clear and in pen) and you still mess it up?  I write mushrooms and you don't add them, twice.  My delicious sweet potato tots come out burnt on time, cold another time and without seasoning.  Then you forget to add the cheese to my burger, and it comes out rare when I clearly marked medium/well.  Did I mention you hostesses lately have been awful?  Is the job requirement to be dumb and/or rude, or are you just not training them?  But, despite your faults I love you and I am hopeful you are just going thru a phase.  So yesterday 7/29/14 I come back with a group of friends in tow and very hungry.  Groupon in hand and excited to stuff myself with tots.  As I pull into the drive, I realize something is wrong.  VERY WRONG.  Was I there on a day you were closed?  No, I have been here on Tuesday nights before.  Why aren't the valet boys running out to my car to park it in your normally very crowded parking lot?  Then I notice it.... A closed for renovations sign.  WHAT!?!?!  But I have a groupon!  Why are you selling groupons (good until August 19th) when you are closed for renovations?  I was just there about a week ago, why didn't you put up signs that you were going to close temporarily?  Why doesn't your closed for renovations sign tell me when you are re-opening?  did you screw me over via groupon?     Arcadia Tavern, I like you a whole lot and I appreciate you are trying to change things, but I am feeling that you are being a really crappy friend.  Are we going to have to end our relationship?",

But we were actually ready to order... should've grabbed the opportunity but we thought we'd see her more often now that we officially had a waitress.  She drops off the waters and before the glass hits the table she's turned away and walking.  We don't see her for another 15 min.  We were debating whether we should just leave when she comes to see if we're ready to order with a halfhearted apology about being hung up somewhere out there.  Whatever.  We actually get our food shortly after that, the wait was way shorter than getting them the order in the first place.    We got the grilled wings for an extra dollar which we thought would be healthier, but turns out they both fry and grill them so now you get charred and extra dry wings.  Goody.  The burger was decent, except they had pockets of super seasoned meat throughout.  So disappointing!  The fries were actually decent but I won't be going back for fries.  Sorry.",

    "text": "We've been here twice and have consistently had terrible service. No stars for the awkward entrance (no hostess or hostess stand). The first time we came here was on a weekday night. Food was OK, service was very slow even though it was nearly empty, and my credit card was charged twice. I had to come back another time with my receipt to get it cleared with the manager.   The second time we went was on a Saturday night with some friends and while our waitress seemed to be trying her best, she was clearly handling too many tables at once. The beer was not cold when it finally arrived and it took us another 30 mins for the waitress to come around and ask if we wanted food. The food was okay but then it took nearly 30 mins between asking for our checks and getting our receipts/change. There were many busboys walking around, but it was near impossible to get a hold of our waitress.   Before we paid, she apologized that it was a crazy night because they were doing renovations soon and would be temporarily closed. I don't think it was necessarily her fault, but management should consider how many patrons they can handle with the staff they have. The food is decent and it's in a great location, but the service is really lacking. Until they figure it out, I'll be at OHSO across the street.  One star for the tator tots which are consistently decent.",

    "text": "Man....what a big, fat BUMMER!!! Dear New Owner....please get your act together and bring back the Arcadia Tavern we know and love.  Ordered my favorite, succulent chicken dish....what a disappointment.  Dry, flavorless....drippy mashed potatoes, thin/oily au jus.  NO!!! This dish was always so perfectly amazing and delicious.  What the heck?  And the cheeseburger-replacement-meal was equally as unappetizing.  Come one guys....are you nuking everything, and that is what is causing tough bun, dry meat and barely -edible chicken?  Get it together!!! And the waitstaff....oy vey! Lackadaisacal to say the least. Friendly-ish....but certainly not oozing customer service.  Best part of the night was the wine. Oh....and the two super nice, wonderful young valet guys who informed me that my front tires were pretty much ready to blow out at any moment. (Seriously thank you...off to the tire store in the a.m.). Too bad the folks inside the restaurant didn't show the same degree of interest in customer service.  Fingers crossed Arcadia Tavern is just going through some growing pains with new ownership....and next visit will be back to the yummy food and awesome service of the past. I'm giving you guys one more chance....hope you can rally.  If I were the owner...I'd be there nightly asking people how their food was (NOTE: plates with barely-touched food are a sign that something is wrong...) and engaging customers.  Lots of competition in that corner of the world....a couple of poor experiences and folks will just mozy on down the road to OHSO, The Vig, or numerous other options. Good luck!",

    "text": "My boyfriend, his father, and I visited this restaurant for the first time on Father's Day. Surprisingly, they were not packed and had open tables. They also offered free signature burgers to all the dads. Our waitress was kind in the beginning, although she didn't tell us about the drink specials, but after taking our order we never saw her again. This was especially odd considering I had ordered a margarita, and was likely to order another had I been prompted, but I guess that's her loss.   Another individual expedited the food, and she had a horrible attitude. We watched her drop an entire tray of food on a table, and she tried giving us food that wasn't our THREE different times. It seems important that someone with the sole job of expediting food learn to read the table numbers on the tickets. She also had long flowing hair that brushed the plates and really grossed me out. PUT YOUR HAIR UP!   Anyways, we had ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and it took 30 minutes to finally arrive at our table, and they were stone cold. We sent them back and didn't have a problem removing them from the bill, fortunately. The food was mediocre. Not too special of a burger for what they charge, and definitely nothing so appetizing to make me want to return.   I was primarily disappointed with the lack of attention we received and the wait time on our food, granted this place wasn't even packed. It was also a buzz kill to be approached by staff with such a poor attitude on day we were trying to celebrate with dad.   I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

    "text": "As a new arrival to Phoenix from Miami, I needed to quickly find somewhere to cheer the Heat on to inevitable victory, as much as Pop and the Spurs are appealing underdogs.  Arcadia was the second place the wife and I tried, Zipps being the first. It's a pleasant, casual, sports bar with a little less emphasis on the Sports than Zipps and a little more emphasis on restaurant than bar. We seemed like the only people there for the game, everyone else was there for food. There's no sound on during the game, which for an avid sports fan may be disappointing, but is probably nice for everyone else. There's a cool little area stocked with toys for kids, in case you're a kid or have them.  The food is obviously why people come. A long list of big, juicy, gourmet burgers will present you, the famished patron, with a gastronomical quandary. The solution is to order the Spinach and Artichoke Dip to allow another few minutes of salivated staring at the menu. The Spinach and Artichoke Dip is pretty good, as spinach and artichoke dips tend to be.  There is also a suckier quandary to be found here. The short list of light, tepid beers on draft is a little disappointing. I'm not going to complain too much, but there's plenty of room for improvement on the beer list. All in all Arcadia is a fun little restaurant for the casual sports fan.",

Service was a little on the slow side, but it was pretty busy, so I understand.  Primary downside for me are the patrons (not exactly Arcadia Tavern's fault, but kind of).  There's an overflow of obnoxious graphic tee types.  While I was there, we witnessed a fist fight outside and the table next to us was bro'd out, loud and crude; Scottsdale Tavern, a more appropriate name.  The second time we swung by to watch football, we discovered that it is apparently a U of A bar - fine if you're a U of A fan.  Worth going, as I'm sure the crowd fluctuates.

    "text": "I was a little nervous reading the reviews about kids in bars which is not okay and not like one Yelper wrote, \"innovative\" by the owners. Hire a babysitter if you want to go out to a bar. A non supervised play area in a bar is frightening concept to this teacher.  However, it was my BFF's birthday and this is where we were going so I bit the bullet.    I was pleasantly surprised. There were no kids there on a Saturday at 8pm. I was thrilled about how much fun we all had. One of the owners/investors hung out and joked around with us for a little while, and the service was great! The place is more like a \"U\" shaped restaurant then a bar, and looked to have a pretty patio although I never made it out there. We loved the band that was playing. ( \"The Real Thing.\" Boy, those gals can sing. Check em out)  We even made our own dance floor and danced the night away,   The food was yet another surprise. It was good for bar food. The pretzel was amazing! Soft and fluffy with some type of cheesy/hummus/artichoke/whatever sauce that 8 gals had a different opinion on what was in it but all agreed was Super Delish! We also had the Tater Tots, ( Crunchy and flavorful) Teriyaki Wings,( YUM) and a Hummus Duo dish. ( It was \"Okay\" for Ms. Picky on the Hummus here) The drinks were drinks, I mean how do you review alcohol? lol Just kidding, I had a \"Dragons Bite\" which is like a fruit type tasting drink. I tasted the \"Cesar Tangerine\" too. They also have a few ice tea options for the DDs and Teetotalers.  There were a few negatives deducting a star. The valet closed at 9pm. We did not get that at all. The bar died down at around 10:30 pm which is way too early even for AZ Standards forcing us to head next door to JT's for two hours. This is another factor that cements it in my mind they are more like a restaurant, not a bar. They forgot my Yelp check in credit on the final bill, they advertised a special on their website that they did not honor ( a business should always honor these things)  and the back bathroom by the Kiddieland had an issue with the door closing. This might make for an awkward scene for sure if a child or other drunk patron walked in on you.(\"Onsie\" stall and the Main door leading to the eating area does not close right. ArcadiaTavern, you need to fix that)   So, if you want a restaurant atmosphere with sports on the TV's, yummy food, and music, this place is great. If you want a bar atmosphere, maybe not so much. I myself really liked it for what it was. Thank you AT for the fun. You just need to lose the kids area please, Okay?",

I also recommend getting the pretzel bun it's pretty fantastic. It is a sports bar, so it can get loud and rowdy. If you don't want that, DO NOT go here. I also don't know if I would bring kids here, the last couple times I've been there a few of the patrons got a little too rowdy and obnoxious. Okay for me, probably not for kids. Maybe during the day?",

This is how it went: I walked in alone as my friend was a few steps behind me outside. Hostess says \"booth or table?\". No \"hi\" or \"welcome\" whatsoever. I said \"Booth. I have 2 but I'm just waiting for one other\" and pointed to him right outside the window. Hostess rolls her eyes, throws down the menus, and walks to the table closest to her door to molest and kiss her boyfriend (who is drinking). My friend walks in 3 second later. We wait for a good 30 seconds while she continues to make out with her boyfriend, then she grabs the menus and walks to us to the booth. Unfortunately our booth was in direct view of the table where her boyfriend was sitting so we were forced to watch the show throughout our whole meal.   Give that job to someone else who needs it.",

We have gone there three times, and the service varies depending on the server, but it is usually always pretty good. Tonight it was exceptional. Three people milled around our table helping out with drinks, dishes, etc.  It was just amazing how nice everyone was and how well we were taken care of.  The drinks are delicious.  We both had martinis and they don't have top shelf alcohol, but they were quite tasty and really well done.  The prices were pretty good, too...I think martinis are expensive normally, but these were big and quite nicely priced.    I love the food here. I had a Steak Salad, shared some wings and enjoyed some tasty chips and salsa.  My mom and son joined us and she loved her salad and my son devoured the tater tots. The burger, however, was grilled and he doesn't like the \"black stuff\", so I got to enjoy a bit there too...totally yummy!!  I know we'll be back. The band \"Sugahbeat\" is awesome and they play there on Fridays (most often) and we love hearing them and enjoying the warm, family friendly, atmosphere...where can you drink beer with friends and let your kids get up and walk around and play Wii?  At home and at Arcadia Tav! Love it!",

The service sucked. Broken glass cut my lip and had to beg to have her replace it. We were sitting in the patio area and the server cleard our table as we were standing there taking our half full drinks and never came back. This place was so much better run and friendlier.  Who ever is running the place now need to lower the prices or something.  People dont want to pay $9 a beer to have it taken or survived in broken glasses. Try to draw people to your newly reopened bar not have them necer want to come back. My group of friend will gladly go somewhere else.",

Our group is loud (VERY loud) and there are a few families who enjoy bringing their children.  We \"interviewed\" Tracy (Director of Operations) to see if this could be the place for us.  The past two places didn't work out.  Both places had poor customer service, one of them acted like we were a burden, even though our group spends quite a bit of money every Saturday.  We were very discouraged about finding a new \"home.\" But Tracy was very professional and even excited about the upcoming season with our group.  For the first time, we were working with a manager who realized that if our group is happy then they will keep coming in, keep spending money and everybody wins!  Is our group happy, you ask?  Heck yes!  Everybody loves it there!  The servers are always smiling and the food (& the selection) is fabulous!  Tracy remains enthusiastic and helpful in making our events successful.  The kids play together in their own little area that is still close enough for their parents to see.    We were definitely lucky that we went to see Tracy when we did.  The space was still available for us and it worked out perfectly.  Some of us stay after our group leaves and the servers are still smiling.  Amazing",

Ordered the Rocky Point burger with Sweet Potato Tots and I really enjoyed it. Portion size was very large: the burger was very big and they give you a lot of tater tots so you definitely get your money's worth. Also, ordered the Nachos and had to share it with my table: very good as well. Waitress was very nice and was very quick when splitting our checks.  Only reason why this place doesn't get a perfect rating is the poor parking situation. My group and I had to park at the Safeway across the street. I would definitely go here again in the future.",

    "text": "My friends have all said this place was great, and I was really excited to check it out. Well, it may be really cool, but we had an awful experience with one of the managers from the second we sat down. My boyfriend and I ordered a beer and we were quickly carded (we're 24, but look about 18) which was fine.  I never, EVER mind being carded. I was a server for a long time so I get it.   But the manager walked over and proceeded to interrogate my boyfriend like he was a 15-year old who just snuck into a rated R movie-- just because his ID was a little haggard.  He peaked smugly back and forth from my boyfriend to the ID making rude jokes and belittling remarks. Once he was done with the investigation, and after he had scanned the ID (why he didn't just scan it in the first place, I do not know), he hesitantly handed my boyfriend his card back like he just gave a toddle chocolate. SO MUCH ATTITUDE.  So I angrily asked him why he had to be so rude about it. \"I understand that we look very young but I don't know why you had to make him feel uncomfortable. I get carded often, but I've never had anyone be so rude. You were very belittling.\" And then he replies, \"Seriously? You think I was being rude? That's totally not True. I'm sorry you THINK I'm being rude.\"  And then he proceeded to argue with me on whether or not he was being a polite person. I was a server for four years on mill avenue, and I have never, ever treated anyone that way while carding them. And the thing is, if some one IS of age, you do not want to piss them off because, DUH, they're buying your product. They're giving you money. So why have attitude? The manager never actually apologized or offered to remedy the situation at all. He just judged us as teenage hoodrats instead of young working professionals that we are. So we left.   Go ahead and give this place a try, but make sure you look rich, dress well and have 15 forms of ID available. You don't want to be judged.  Oh and stay away from the short, stubby manager in glasses with a smug grin-- he'll make your skin crawl.",

My dinner visit was on a Friday night, so the place was packed and it took a while to get our food, but having been in the food and beverage business in a past life, I know how that goes.  I've tried 5 or 6 different menu items and they have all been tasty, cooked properly and presented attractively. The staff has always been attentive and friendly, and if I'm being honest, there's also some really attractive women working here! :)  The only thing that kinda sucks is the parking. There aren't many spaces and a good percentage of the spots are always reserved for the valet. Having said that, valet has always been free, except for the tip. If there's no parking, a few bucks to valet your car 12 feet from the front door ain't so bad.  Recommended!",

It has a wonderful set up to check out a game and enjoy a beer.  The service is excellent.  However, the food left a lot to be desired.  My girlfriend and I decided to check the place out since they had a Restaurant Week deal.  We called ahead just to make sure they weren't packed, and the girl on the phone said a table just opened up and she's save it for us.  Good start.  The parking lot is small and could be a cluster so Arcadia Tavern provides complimentary valet.  That also works for me.  A live band was a nice touch, but it also made the place a little too loud for 8:00.   The Restaurant Week deal was from a selection of an appetizer, two entrees and a dessert for $30.  We went with the spinach dip, the fish and chips and half roasted chicken, and the arcadia cookie.  The spinach dip was great, the chips that came with it were nothing special.  The fish and chips were less than stellar.  Neither the fish or fries were very flavorful.  The Chicken was really good, but not something I would really order from a tavern.  The cookie was okay, but way too under baked.  I know that a \"pizza cookie\" in a skillet is supposed to be under baked, but this could've definitely used another minute or two in the oven.  It was more like warm cookie dough with ice cream.  Arcadia Tavern does have a pretty good beer selection.  Drafts were served in Goblet filled all the way to rim.  I don't know why, but I always find that to be pretty cool to drink out of a goblet.  If you live in the area, and are looking for a place to eat and watch a game, this a place worth checking out.  There are many sandwich and burger options, plus wings and more traditional tavern food.  I think if I were to return, I will give those a try.",

The woman I spoke to recommended that we make reservations so that they would have a table for us.  She confirmed again what game we were interested in seeing so that she could indicate it next to our reservation.   When we arrived for our reservation I double checked with the hostess that the game would be playing.  She said she would let someone know where we were sitting so that they could put the correct channel on the tv near us.  We waited another 10 minutes without the correct channel coming on.  I asked an employee walking by if he could make sure that the tv was going to have the Mercury on.  After that request got us nowhere I asked the waitress.  She said she would tell the manager.  Still no Mercury and by this time the start time of the game had passed.  My friend went to the hostess stand and asked to speak to a manager.  He came out and she told him we were there to watch the Mercury and he said \"I just turned it on.\"  It had been turned on 2 tv's over to our left not even in our line of vision.  She pointed out where we were sitting and he changed it, finally.  We missed the tip off and the first 5 or 6 minutes of the game.  He came over to our table and said \"All you had to do is ask.\"  I told him I asked several people from the moment we walked in the door plus we had a reservation for this specific purpose made by his own employee taking the team name down for us.  He said \"Well it's on now\" and walked away.   I was shocked to see such terrible customer service.   I will never return.",

The portion sizes are generous for the price. Even the half-size nachos are  enough for two people to share. Try the prickly pear margarita. It's a tad sweet for a margarita, but it's a massive drink well worth the $6.50.  One thing to note, this place is very family friendly. There is a back section with lots of toys and a wii for kids to play with. The bar/patio area where happy hour is served feels like a different place entirely. My friends and I, all childless 20-something's, were surprised to stumble upon so many kids while we made our way to the bathroom, while I can only assume young families wouldn't be too pleased with the loud music at the bar. I imagine not many sports bars can cater to these two very different crowds, but Arcadia Tavern does it well.",

The prices are reasonable and the food is always great.   Personally, I come here for their happy hours (which end at 7) to watch sporting events at the bar. The bar area is a bit narrow in the summers when the drop down walls are down but a bit more spacious in the cooler months when the patio is not separated from the bar. The happy hour menu is very affordable and has several options for both food and beverages. The bartenders and servers are very personable and knowledgable. The service is always top notch.  The only downside is that the parking lot is tiny and I almost always have to walk from Alberstons across the street. However, they do provide valet service. In sum, if your in the area you cant go wrong with trying this place out.",

    "text": "I've been on a quest for a solid sports bar for a while now, and I have to say that the Tavern is my fav so far. Their menu is quite diverse for a sports bar. The Ahi Salad and the Miso Salmon are two gems on the menu, and I was shocked when I tried those dishes and they were phenominal (as far as bar food goes).  Also, their Bruchetta is delish. I know everyone always talks about the bruchetta at Postinos, but in my opinion Arcadia Tavern makes a heartier and tastier board. The spinach & artichoke bruchetta is so yummy, and during the week you can get a board of bruchetta and bottle of wine for only $20 - Now take that Postinos!   The bartenders, servers & manager all embody great customer service. This past weekend I wanted to watch some football (and sport my 49ers Montana throw-back Jersey of course), and the manager was totally accommodating when we specified that the Niners vs. Sea Chickens game was our must watch for the afternoon. He was so helpful and friendly, and seated us right next to some fellow Niners fans. Many times I'll go into sports bars and they just can't accomodiate my sports tv requests, but at the Tavern I've never had a problem!  I'd recommend the Tavern to anyone and everyone! It's a great gathering spot for friends, and they also have fun nightly specials... I mean who doesn't like a good round of Gold Fish Racing! (FYI - Gold Fish Racing is held every Thursday night, and if you haven't experienced this then you should. It's pretty silly & fun!)",

To start, their parking lot is full and they have complimentary valet...just let them park...why waste time.  Next, when you walk through the door, to the left is a little table with coffee, cream, and some delicious flavorings to boot.  They have all their TVs tagged with the game so you know exactly where to sit.  The day was beautiful as was their outside patio.  They had a good selection for breakfast with the essentials...bacon, eggs, sausage,pancakes, etc..  I had the biscuits and gravy..I found it to perfect.  I saw some of their lunch menu being served and it all looked great.  I ordered a bloody beer and a couple more as the game progressed.  The whole staff is very friendly and on top of things.  I was very pleased to have been introduced to this place and will be back in the near future..perhaps another Sunday game day.",

We asked the food runner to get the missing itmes and he disappeared never to bring them. When the waitress came by we informed her that the order was wrong, and she said to my friend that she heard him order what was on the plate, but said she would fix it. About 15 minutes later the missing items arrived after we had finished everything else. I asked to substitute tots and asparagus for the beans and rice, and was told it was ok, but when I got the bill I was charged for both. My soda was never refilled, and my friends wine was refilled once toward the end of the meal. As for the food, it was ok, but sure not worth the wait or hassle. We will not be returning. I suggest trying somewhere else where they seem to care about the customer.",

Party was perfect and dinner after was divine. We started with sweet potato tots. Yeah, you read that right. SWEET. POTATO. TOTS! They were tasty! I was really tired and can't remember if they're served with a dip-able, don't think they are. Gabi M and I shared the salmon which was tasty! They were kind enough to split it up in the back, placing both our pieces atop a jasmine rice. Could have used some more veg (the asparagus it was served with was minimal) but the dish had great flavor and apparently it's a pretty popular pescado in Arcadia. You know me, I'm not one to turn down dessert and make everyone else eat it after a take a bite, so our group shared the equivalent of Oregano's pazookie. But bigger, and less \"done.\" Mmmmm.   Know Before You Go: Great for kids! They have a little game area that keeps the little ones occupied. Smart idea for parents looking to get out, watch a game and eat good food!",

It was a great welcome to the neighborhood!  Also every time I have had \"buffalo\" anything it has been phenomenal.    Ask monty about the \"brojito\" which is a delicious take on the mojito and ask Kristina for her take on the gin and tonic sometimes called a \"sneakers o'toole\".  Enjoy!",

The slow service has gotten slower; the food quality has been deteriorating for over a year; prices have been going up ($16 for fish tacos?); and now if you choose a healthy alternative to their French fries, like coleslaw, fruit, or a side salad (no extra charge at 99% of restaurants), they whack you an extra $2.  This place, which started out as one of my favorites, is about as customer and health unfriendly as you will find in this area.",
