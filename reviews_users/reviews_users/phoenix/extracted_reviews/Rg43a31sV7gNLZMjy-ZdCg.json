I ordered the ground burger, medium rare, and my friend ordered the P&P Benedict. My burger came out medium but I'm used to that at this point. Besides that, it was absolutely delicious and my friend said her p&p benedict was heavenly. Of course we had to order mimosas and bloody sconnie. Both drinks came out fresh and delicious. All in all, this place is top notch. Definitely will plan another trip when I visit Phoenix again",

When you look at it and try to read it, you feel like its a completely different language.  There are no descriptions or pictures to even help you out.  Basically this is a place for people who like to eat every single part of a pig...including belly and bone marrow.  Just a little too different for us. We tried a few things but the only thing we ended up liking was just plain old macaroni and cheese and tater tots. If you like Guinness beer then you will want to try the Nitro Milk Stout...it was delicious. We can't see ourselves ever going here again.",

    "text": "We had a fantastic experience here last night! The day after St. Patrick's Day evidently made for a fairly slow Friday night. We were seated immediately, and taken care of well the entire time. My husband had the bone marrow, and I saw a smile on his face that let me know all of the stress of the day had disappeared. He said his duck was the best he's ever had. I'll take his word on that, I'm not a fan of duck. I have a sensitive stomach, and have to order carefully to avoid problems. I ordered the dump truck salad with no tomatoes and the dressing on the side. The vegetables were so fresh and full of flavor, that I never ended up even touching my dressing! It was so spectacular that I'm having difficulty gagging down this bagged salad from the grocery store as I write this review.  I also ordered the house made charcuterie, pickles and bread. The server was kind enough to make sure that I had bread without cheese or tomatoes to meet my needs. He even replaced the butter with a fabulous mustard that really enhanced the meats. My favorite of the evening was what I believe they called the hunter sausage. It made me break into my \"happy food dance!\" The spices were complex and not over powering. Some of the pickled items were a bit of a single note, and probably could benefit from some added dill, onions, or garlic in the brine. But the sweet pickles were the best I've had, and I'm usually not a fan.",

The decor is super cute - dim lighting with an inviting bar and pig signs/pictures/designs everywhere - loved it! But the food was even better. We ordered just a few small plates to share. The pork belly (umm, yum! perfectly cooked and delicious tender and flavorful), the pork shoulder tostatas (they come 2 to an order and are piled high with shredded pork) and the shrimp & grits.  We had that kind of service where you don't notice they are there, but your water cup is always full and the empty plates are always promptly removed.   Loved it! I will be coming back here as soon as I can!",

    "text": "Sunday 10/16 at around 6:00PM. My boyfriend is in his 50s and is an F&B manager at a country club with over 35 years of food and beverage service. I'm in my 40s; I am now in medicine but I was a wine somm with over 20 years of my own F&B. We know both front and back of the house well. We love to dine out and appreciate service as much as good food. This was a casual night out for us. At P&P we were greeted and allowed to choose a seat outside. Our server was Jake. I asked him \"how is business?\" He said, \"it's slow tonight - there's the Taco Fest and people that can afford to spend to money at restaurants are out of town\". My boyfriend and I just looked at each other (....did he really just say that?)... He took our drink order as well as appetizers. He asked if we wanted waters. Our cocktails and appetizers arrived before the water was finally delivered. The Brussel sprouts app came out much quicker than we expected and we thought they were great. However, the lettuce wraps - 3 for $12. Somewhat over-salted, no sauce. In fact, it was as if they were made with soy sauce and a packet of taco seasoning. We were still hungry but had no desire to stay any longer. Jake asked us twice before our appetizers were finished if we wanted anything else. To put us out of our misery, after the second time he asked, I let him know, \"we just stopped by for an quick appetizer and we will take the check.\" It took nearly 10 minutes for the check to arrive. Tito's on the rocks, a ginger beer, Brussel sprouts and lettuce wraps = $35. Gave him a credit card. When he returned for me to sign the check, he asked if we were finished with our food. We said yes, at which point he then reached through my arms (as I was signing the check) to retrieve every last plate and utensil on the table, and hurried away. A place that touts \"we dig the pig\" - and NO pork ribs? Something to consider. More important to consider is wait staff training. As I mentioned before, we both have a few years experience in the biz. We understand when and how things are done well and when things are not. We are not snobs; we do give a fair critique. Being insulted and hurried doesn't bode well. Customer service is of utmost importance. It wouldn't have mattered if the food was amazing - we will not return to P&P.",

I love pork and anything pickled so the name took me in immediately.  We always get the charcuterie: delectable bits of cured meat with pickles and bread. We've also ordered the grilled octopus, pork liver smear, pork shoulder tostadas, mussels, bone marrow, foie gras, duck breast salad, and other things that I can't remember the exact name of and are no longer on their ever-changing menu. Aside from the grilled octopus which was a tad too salty, we have loved everything we've ordered. But the food isn't the only great thing about Pig & Pickle, they also serve delicious cocktails, and if you get there during happy hour the prices are pretty nice.  Pig & Pickle is a place I frequently recommend, and will always come back to.",

I had their truffle fries and bone marrow and it was just fine. The fries were average, definitely better than fast food but not better than any other fancier joint in the area. The bone marrow was saltier than I would have liked. As in, way too salty by like 5-10 dashes of salt.  I think this restaurant definitely has a lot of potential and is a really cool hangout for young people in Scottsdale, but could be better considering its competition in the area.",

We sat near the bar, at a high table and ordered 5 things off the menu, mostly appetizers but one entree (the pot roast). We also had a salmon appetizer, a pickled appetizer plate, a cheese plate, charcuterie, and possibly one other item. I'm not doing them justice by listing them. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented, with interesting accoutrements accompanying them. And the ingredients were fresh--you can tell.  Our waiter was wonderful. After asking about the beer on the menu, I decided to try the \"surprise\" beer of the moment. They open several kegs a day of different, miscellaneous beers, in addition to their impressive microbrew offerings. Turned out it was a beer I'd been wanting to try but there was only a tiny amount left on tap. The waiter gave me the last half-glass on the house, which was really very nice of him.  With a $15 coupon, we couldn't go wrong. Even without a coupon next time, we still won't go wrong. I recommend this to people who want to try interesting meals with more than just the usual fusion, but real imagination.",

My dining companions enjoyed their omelets as well. Someone had an over easy egg that was over hard. But, no real complaints.   Unfortunately I have to dock some stars for the service. Our waiter brought me the wrong drink, not a huge deal. My friend asked if they had diet coke and the waiter said yes. She was brought a bottle of boylans diet cola. The waiter should have specified that it would be bottled and a different brand. Maybe he was hoping she orders refills to increase the bill?   I had to ask for every refill of coffee. Just keep it filled, man. It's brunch.   He dropped off the check. The four of us each put our card in and asked for it split. \"Oh. So I guess you want it split? Next time you should tell us you needed it before we drop off the check.\" So I said, you could also ask if we need it split. He said no, he can't assume that. Maybe it's someone's birthday. What? I've served before. It's not difficult. Its just a four top. You keep track of who had what and at the end of the meal you ask \"do we need this together or separate?\" Or, drop it off and just split it without complaining or lecturing your customers.   When he dropped off the check he gave an incredibly sarcastic \"Havvvveeee a greeaaat day ladies!!!\" We get it. We annoyed you. Learn to grin and bear it and be a professional about it.",

The Foie Gras was so salty that it was like eating salt packed sardines that weren't rinsed - sad because it was excellent last week. The tater tots were basically like round croquettes with no filling (they were supposed to be filled with ham and cheese), and we were told that they would be exploding with goodness... They were like deep fried mashed potatoes. The Dump Truck salad, and, as I mentioned before, the beat salad were my favorites. I will come back again for sure but will not anticipate great service.",

First let me say that I don't eat pork so I can't speak to their \"specialty\"; however, this place was chosen for a celebration which is why I attended. Anyway, I ordered the fish tacos because it was one of the two items (on the late night menu) that were non-pork/beef and was MORTIFIED! As soon as our waiter placed my plate in front of me my nose was insulted by the scent of (and I will keep this a G-rated as possible) the \"undercarriage\" of a street walker after a very looong day! I CANNOT make this up! I passed the plate around to the entire party so they could \"smell\" that I was not making it up. They took the plate back and I ordered the Udon noodles (very good BTW). However, when my check arrived they tried to charge me an automatic gratuity of 20% that included the cost of the fish tacos in the gratuity! Needless to say I will not be back.",

Your cocktails are excellent too. Everything you do is wonderfully simple but not at all boring. Oh, and your patio is nice.  Let's never break up.  Love,   Sarah",

    "text": "Closer to two and a half. I think this place has a great vibe and the concept is hilariously awesome. Just the execution of some of our dishes were so-so. Definitely think I could bump up the rating after another visit but this is where I currently stand.  Starting with the drink I ordered, the Maggie. Strawberry and lilikoi are some of my favorite flavors in sweets. But my table and I could agree that the dominating flavors were tequila and OJ. My friend ordered the hard root beer, and it's what you expect except slightly disappointing. Maybe we just suck at picking drinks, I don't know.  We started with the bone marrow since it was a popular mentioned item here. Two thick bones, with buttered toast, okra pickles, and \"peperonata\" that was basically red pepper pesto. The bone marrow was bomb, but I think buttering the toast makes it overkill on the fats. I think toasted bread alone would be great.  My main item was a build your own burger, medium, with duck egg and pork belly, plus tots instead of fries or salad. The tots are amazing, you get two giant stuffed whoppers of amazing potato goodness. Got hints of cheese or something else, it's not just fried mashed potatoes. Definitely worth it in my opinion, but you might get slightly less mass than ordering fries.  What was disappointing was the burger itself. The duck egg was clutch with a runny yolk, and you get a huge slab of pork belly. But the patty itself was underdone for both me and another mate. Mine was between medium rare and rare even though I ordered medium. My friend ordered medium rare but his was underdone as well. With the burger too soft, the runny yolk that's normally awesome become unpleasant to eat. Maybe it's an off day, but 0/2 isn't too hot.   I think this place is a bit pricey, but those tots and burger I did manage to enjoy were great. I'd love to come back and have my faith restored, but my dinner was on a shaky note.",

    "text": "I've been here twice now and this time the whole restaurant was redone and I REALLY love how they've redecorated! It's got a very cool, welcoming vibe and I will definitely return.  There are a couple of reasons I didn't 5-star this beauty. One: slow bartenders who don't greet you at all. You just sit there like an idiot until you're so dehydrated you ask for something to quench your thirst. NO BUENO. Socializing with everyone while a customer waiting for a drink is just bad form. Two: very, and I mean very, limited vegetarian menu. And while I get that 'pig' is in the name, not everyone participates in the eating of your cloven hoofed animal. So please expand that, it would be so awesome.  So, to get down to it. I sat at the bar and once I finally got my drink everything moved pretty smoothly. Good beer selection, by the way. Not original, but no Coors Light here so I consider it a good selection. I ordered some delicious fried Brussels sprouts with asiago & a farm fresh egg and let me tell you, that was probably the best I've ever eaten. I have no idea where my aversion to BR's came from. Probably because my mom didn't do them P&P style. DO NOT MISS THESE.   For dinner I had ratatouille with a blob of goat cheese in the middle. Not a great taste at all. I wouldn't have even ordered it had there been a bigger variety of veggie dishes to choose from and you can sure bet I won't order it again. It was odd. I don't even know who made this dish up, blech. At any rate it was P&P so they did make it better than any other place I've eaten it (the very few times I have) so there's that. Their menu changes often so hopefully they'll incorporate better selections.  All in all it's got a great vibe and for you meat eaters this place will seem like culinary heaven. It's a definite keeper for the ambiance alone!",

    "text": "I had decided that I was not giving in to the \"Pig-themed\" restaurants.  I mean \"Pig\", \"Pork\" and \"Swine\" restaurants are popping up everywhere!  But I noticed that, no matter how hard I tried to ignore P&P, it would pop-up on all of the foodie sites that I check around Phoenix.  So, for several months, I scoped this place out... checked out this restaurant online and with daily drive-bys in my daily commute.  I finally decided 2 months ago that I needed to check out P&P.  I was sold, food-whipped on my first visit and I've been every week since.  They source all their veggies locally.  They make as much as they can in house from the meats on the chacuterie tray to the pickled veggie/items that appear on every dish.  They even bake their own bread!  I fell in love y'all, with a Pig & Pickle.  This restaurant is in a nondescript strip of shops.  I could not tell you what stores exist adjacent to P&P.  It is off the well \"beaten Scottsdale Rd\" path, and yet, the food is exciting, relevant and has a depth of flavors that is unbelievable.  I'm a fan of P&P and once you give it a try, I think you will be too.  I have tried a few things on the menu, let me start with the crafted cocktails - pricey, but still yummy and worth every penny.  They carry premium spirits and they make just about everything that goes in those crafted drinks from scratch.  If you don't want to spend $12 per cocktail, they have a wonderful HH menu with $5 cocktails from 4-6pm. Satly Dog: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=aG_8tn9ZxqvTDDwRB-tfhA#wshXHwfqyLloLxHV7g86eQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-...</a>   The star of P&P is the food.  I have tried several things on the menu and I'm happy to say that not one thing was even remotely disappointing.  Everything that I've been served there was 4 Stars and above.  My favorite item thus far was on the new brunch menu.  P&P started serving brunch this past Sunday.  After church, I stopped in and ordered the Bloody Sconnie and the Bacon, Andouille Sausage and Aisago Cheese Fratta.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=f-ez6J4BhI4U2Gk_Brvr7Q&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  An extremely delicious dish that is really more like a crustless quiche.  This dish has a serious (and I mean SERIOUS) kick to it.  It is not for the people who can't handle spicy food.  This dish was excitingly delicious.    My 2nd favorite was the braised pork belly <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=od8GMSNVUu4fAT3H1IoqcA&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>   The braised pork belly sat atop a delicious mound of mashed turnip bottoms.  The pork belly provided the right amount of saltiness that was balanced just right by the sweetness of the apple butter.  The arugula top the creation was just the right amount of earthiness to pair with the turnip bottoms.  I love all the flavors.  But as I told my mom, it was almost like eating a southern meal that contained ALL these ingredients, but prepared somewhat differently!      During Happy Hour, they offer a chacuterie plate <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=n62C4gnnQkajkiORQ-tpaw&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a> that is HUGE for the $5 that they charge!  In this pic, the chacuterie included bacon butter to spread on my homemade pretezel bread.  YUMMY... YUM is all I can say!    To top it off, they have the nicest guys working behind the bar.  I mean... honestly, part of what makes my day when I go into a place like this are cute guys who can mix a drink and order up some food for me to eat.  Clayton and Scott are awesomely attentive and I just love sitting at their bar!    My to try list (because I trust everything on their menu): Shrimp and Grits Braised Duck Leg Croque Madame Salmon Tot - 6/30/2013 - 4star.  Pork Shoulder Tostadas  Each 3rd Monday of the Month, join them for Beer Dinner 6:30pm.  I'm hopeful they will have other events in the future.  I think their crafted cocktails would be a great thing to center an event around.  Oh gosh, they have free wi-fi too!  This is a gem in Scottsdale/Old Town.  Eat, Pig out and Enjoy!",

I had a table out on the patio and my server took my drink order (a soda) and forgot me for 25 min. They comped me the soda, but I was freezing my tushy off by then. I ordered the veggie supper, which was good but unfortunately, had some issues. The asparagus ends weren't cut off completely, so there were woody bits and the turnip was undercooked and extremely bitter.  I hope that P&P kicks it up a notch to maintain such a good standing. The place is great and the concept awesome, so hopefully this review will help!",

    "text": "I've never had a service as bad as this one. It's a shame because we've read all these great reviews and our whole party agreed that this was the worst experience we've ever had. (only giving 1 star because it won't allow me to post without one)   I'm a server, so I first hand understand and know how it is when dealing with parties of 5 or more people BUT the way we were treated and taken care of was not okay.   First off, our server Anthony was rude and paid no attention to any of us AND it wasn't even busy. A couple of people on our table didn't get water for 20 min because he was no where to be found. It took about 30 min before we could place an order. And his responses were short and rude. Everything was \" yeah it says it right there\" or \" um yeah\" or \" um no.\" I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure the sass isn't necessary when guests are asking a simple question. One of our friends asked for a side of ketchup two times and never even got it.  Second, our food was luke warm and my friends burger was under cooked.   When we asked for our bill we realized we all had gratuity already added to it and we asked our server about the gratuity, he gave us a sassy/rude response saying it's automatically on there. Which is fine, but again the attitude was not necessary.    Then Anthony came by faster then ever to pick up the checks that were signed. After he came to pick up the checks he was circling the table and noticed someone in our party writing a review. Anthony came up to our table and asked if there was any issues and then dropped a card with a managers name and number on it then continues to say that if we have problems to call the number. What was really upsetting was after giving us the card Anthony felt the need to come up and confront the guest he saw writing a review and said \"I'll be seeing if you have issues on Yelp tomorrow\" ( very rude and sassy AGAIN) AND he took the card with the managers number on it away from our table.   Him confronting someone in our party about a review is not only unprofessional and inappropriate but also none of his business.",

The mustard is SOO sweet and tangy it played on to the flavors of the meats and pickles so well.   My boyfriend got the pork burger, and tots (BBQ chicken stuffed) and omg! The tots were fantastic!

That's what I liked: no hesitation, just fix it. .and they did.   Waiter was on the ball and atmosphere was relaxed, not Scottsdale pretentious. .. nice place, I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "12/13/12  Nice space!  Let me rephrase that-- very cool-looking bar counter, but the rest of the room was too open, with low four-tops in the middle of the main room and high two- to four-tops next to bare walls and near the bar area.  It felt a little disconcerting...  Upon entering the restaurant, I immediately gravitated to the bar counter, where the choicest seats seemed to be.  The bartender there was friendly and eager to tell me all about the beers offered here.  After being able to sample one of the beers (sorry, none of the ones listed online sounded familiar), I decided to go with a glass of Malm Sonoma pinot noir ($10).  A pet peeve of mine is having to drink wine from a beer glass- not cool, but I got over it.  I started off with the Braised Pork Belly, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=IxQZJrjKInhC-mVb9TCd1g#IxQZJrjKInhC-mVb9TCd1g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-...</a> which came charred (grr!) and sitting on top of a delightful silky bed of (not cloyingly) sweet yam puree, and garnished with Brussels sprouts slaw and maple syrup.  I expected the pork belly to have a little more crunch after seeing all that char, but it was almost too tender.  It tasted quite lovely, but I preferred the pork belly that Roka Akor used to serve (I hear it's not on the menu, anymore?).  I really enjoyed the yam puree's contribution to the dish-- it was almost jammy.  Still, at $10, I'm going to skip it next time (and resolve to look for it on my next trip to Roka Akor!).  For my main, I had the Braised Duck Leg, $13, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=aUDb-8nR1pDZroVx1gHiHQ#aUDb-8nR1pDZroVx1gHiHQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-...</a> which was a work of art!  Gorgeous colors and a MYRIAD of textures and flavors, it is definitely a dish I would order again and again!  The duck was crispy and very delicious- one of the best pieces of duck I've ever had the pleasure of tasting!  I especially enjoyed the crispy mung bean cake upon which the leg was placed on.  (Being Asian, I am familiar with mung beans- red, yellow, and green, to name a few, so to see this ingredient used in a novel way in American cuisine was exciting!)  I so loved the big bursts of ginger flavor in the cake-- I wish to see this item on more menus- at least as a substitute for crispy polenta, or risotto.  The sweet soy had almost a balsamic twist to it.  I whole-heartedly recommend this dish!  To finish, I ordered the Apple Turnover, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=4bSitqEOaCaP4SvbuyJb6A#4bSitqEOaCaP4SvbuyJb6A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-...</a> with vanilla-bean ice cream, $6- a special of that day, which required I wait an extra twenty minutes to bake-- I do not mind waiting for freshly-baked pastries!  This delightfully-flaky turnover arrived atop a rivulet of beautiful caramel sauce, piping-hot tender spiced apple slices inside, a dollop of creme fraiche, and apple matchsticks on top.  All of this was garnished with toasted pine nuts... Exquisite, and yes, I ate it all!    Since I arrived during happy hour, I was able to get a $1 off each item.  I found the tab a bit pricey ($46, including an $8 tip), but I did have wonderful leftovers for lunch at work the next day-- everyone kept eyeing what I was eating and asked where I found it on the buffet spread!  As if!  :)  I'll absolutely be back! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=AFu1PBeqCLa2A1NVFXRwbA#AFu1PBeqCLa2A1NVFXRwbA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-...</a>",

I was surprised by how little customers were in there but I can see why since their location isn't the best. Every other restaurant was booked solid so we stumbled across this on Yelp and I'm glad we did.",

I've sat at the bar several times, and the same douchey bartender is there. Lackluster service, weak and expensive drinks. No shits given about you, the customer. The food is pretty good. I really like the mussels. Most food items have some form of pork (hence the name) so be aware. There's no sense of community or anything on the menu that makes me want to return.",

We started with the pork belly, which was amazing...very tender and flavorful. Then we had the broccoli and brown ale soup, which was topped with bacon...heaven! I finished with the drunken chicken, which was a little different than I expected, but still very good. My husband had the pork burger and turkey-bacon tater tots, both of which were very good. Next time we are in Scottsdale, I think we will make it a point to come back.",

    "text": "I'd been to the Pig and Pickle for dinner before about 2 months ago. It was good, but my friend and I were disappointed to learn that the duck fat fries were only available during the late night hours.  My husband and I came back tonight at midnight, and definitely weren't disappointed! We ordered the duck fat fries which came with this delicious vinegar aioli. For $5, the portion size for the duck fat fries was cheap! It was a huge serving!  We also shared the Apocalypse Sow Burger. I came on Yelp to see what was recommended and this burger was mentioned as a must. And it is! It's thick, with thick cut bacon that's cooked crisp, carmelized onions, served with a huge pickle on the side. The pickle had a bit of a bite to it, like jalapeno. My husband was joking that he was about to lick his plate clean bc the burger was so yummy. Either come really hungry or split the burger with someone you love.   I asked the server to recommend a fruity drink, and when he mentioned he could whip up a Harvey Wallbanger, I was game. I'd never had one before, but had heard of them. They were Sophia Petrillo's drink of choice on The Golden Girls-how could I refuse? My husband ordered coffee, and it didn't come out of a pot like other restaurants.   The server made the coffee in a French Press, and brought it out to the table. He told my husband to give it a few more minutes to finish brewing before pressing down on the grounds. It smelled enchanting. The coffee came out nice and smooth; some of the best coffee I've ever enjoyed.   We shared everything, and came out stuffed. This place is about 30 min away from our house, but we'll be back for sure. It was a chill atmosphere; there was music playing but it wasn't so obnoxiously loud you couldn't carry on a conversation. It wasn't busy, which was nice.",

They even have a Late Night Menu.  What did we have?    The pickle platter (\"Some Pickled Things\") is a must - many unusual (rarely pickled) items - red grapes anyone?! Delicious!   Also tried the \"Apocalypse Sow\" burger - ground pork burger, bacon, aged cheddar & grilled onions - absolutely great!  Final item we tried was the \"Tot of the Day\" - good - but not up to the standard set by the other two items listed above.  Oh and did I mention the extensive beer menu?  I honestly don't remember what we had, but that's the point - take the guidance offered by the bartender.  You like it hoppy? fruity? heavy/light? - answer honestly - and then drink whatever is put in front of you - you'll be glad you did!  Run, don't walk to the Pig & Pickle!",

We were greeted right away, and our waiter was totally on top of his game and very knowledgable. We really didn't wait for anything.  The food is very decent. I think it will only get better as they get more experienced. We ordered the cod bites, which are good but nothing special. I wanted to try the pork shoulder tostadas, but the boyfriend chose the appetizer dish. I did really like the fries and aioli that came with it, though  He got the pot roast sandwich which he enjoyed ( you must try the tater tot concoction side dish) and I got the duck leg. It was very good, but a bit dry.   The one complaint I have is that they allow smoking on their patio, directly in front of the door. We were seated fairly close to the door, and as soon as someone walked through, we got a huge whiff of it. I absolutely can't stand cigarette smoke, and don't think it has any place near a restaurant, but to each their own. I do think they should force smokers to use a different area of the patio, though.   We will most likely be back, but will ask to sit in a different area. Other than that it was a great experience.",

We started with a basic beer and glass of wine, but ended with a yummy cocktail and one of the better bloody mary's I've had. This place is just fun to sit and drink at -cute bar, fun vibe, great bartender. We should have gotten the tots - they change daily based on their menu apparently and the guy next to us got them and we were very jealous. I ended up getting the biscuits and gravy with pulled pork added and fiance had the eggs benny. Both were good, but I think I would prefer their dinner menu more than their brunch. My biscuits or gravy had that refrigerator taste but the pulled pork was good. Fiance said he would have preferred pork belly to the pulled pork on his benny. Needless to say, I am giving this place 5 stars because I have heard such great things and we had such a good time. I'm thinking the flavors were just a mistake that day and you can't base judgement off of your one time, especially when friends go all the time and have a great experience.",

And my favorite, the Duck with picked mustard seed sauce and a wonderful, nutty tasting millet risotto! Yum!!  Our service was great, knowledgeable and welcoming. The owner, who was expoing at the line right next to our table came over a few times and talked with us. We left happy and full and for 4 people and over 6 dishes and drinks only spent $150.

    "text": "After taking another couple to the Pig's brunch last Sunday, I have been thinking about returning to the place for a specific  menu item....prime rib. I'm usually an omnivore if the food is done well. I have not been shy about sharing the places that do all food justice. Tonight, Peg and I returned to the P&P because we knew that the aforementioned prime rib was on the menu. OMG!  If you are tired of things that some restaurants try to do to this product via rubs, coatings, or anything else that is NOT just your basic wonderful cut ofmeat, then you really need to check the version that Keenan, Josh and crew serve. It is, IMHO, the best in the Valley hands down!!. Deliciously rare-med rare, a twice-baked with broccoli and the wonderfulness of a good potato, and the bet-you-can-only-eat- half verision of what tasted like the oldtime Parker House dinner roll. Peg's scallops and corn combo were amazing, and we started with splitting a banh mi sandwich and a bowl of gazpacho...both on the great happy hour menu as well. Thank God we 86'd the wedge salad!  The banh mi was incredbile....and it will be split (with a dump truck salad, perhaps) for an entire  dinner next time. BTW..dipping the sandwich IN the gazpacho is a bit of heaven in and of itself. At any rate....this meal was memorable. Yet again, Chris, Kat, and the always efficient servers were filling water glasses and being attentive. The more we go to this place....the better it gets!

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I'm NEVER the type to complain or even take the time to log into Yelp to share my opinion unless it's an awesome review but this deserves to be known. My good friend decided he wanted to try Pig & Pickle as he had been referred to the restaurant by a fellow KCCO-er. He knew that taking me there may be a stretch as I am a self proclaimed \"5 year old eater\" but what the heck he thought. When we sat down we weren't greeted right away by our waiter but no biggie. When he did come over he asked if we had ever been there and when we said no he did a good job at explaining the culture of the restaurant and the food (cool!) Once he went to actually take our order things went down hill. I ordered first and I half jokingly asked if they had a kids menu because for me the menu was a little out there (sorry for the foodies out there (including my friend) I'm sure I'm an embarrassment ;)) I mean c'mon he didn't even crack a smile at that he just looked at me like I was an idiot and said no. I then proceeded to order the burger and when I asked for pickles (it is in the name after all) he said \"It will come with a pickle on the side but not on the burger\" I then ordered the fries as the side and he very condescendingly said \"already knew that!\" My friend proceeded to order all the wonderful things he saw on the menu and the waiter was much more responsive and welcoming to him. Once we received our appetizer, the waiter came back and proceeded to talk to my friend about the secret menu and even showed him a picture on his phone of a specialty burger so obviously this waiter takes his food seriously. Which by the way I respect totally but throughout the rest of the meal the waiter completely ignored me and only acknowledged my friend. It really made me feel like he was punishing me because I ordered the burger (which so did my friend!) but I'm just not the adventurous eater...sue me! Even my friend noticed and said I feel like I'm eating by myself because he is blantantly ignoring you. I felt so uncomfortable the entire time I was there which was disappointing because my friend was enjoying his meal but not the service. So word to the wise...if you don't like to be too adventurous with your meal choices I would not recommend this place but if you are...you'd really enjoy it since the owners are actually the cooks (pretty cool!) So there's my two cents...if you get the server by the name of Sean (which I only found out because it was on the bill the I paid) beware...he may hurt your view of this potentially awesome restaurant. I will end on a good note to say the rest of the staff was much more friendly but there's definitely a bad apple.",

    "text": "P & P is a foodie place. The speciality, as the name suggests, is meat, particularly pork. The pork shoulder tostadas with kimchi are to die for: fluffy, moist, perfectly seasoned. The pulled pork melts in your mouth and kimchi topping is the perfect accompaniment. There are two per serving, and with the side order of Dump Truck Salad--a generous serving of fresh greens with seeds of and vinaigrette dressing, you have a perfect small meal. Amazing deals during 4-6 happy hour and late night menu (10pm-2 am) on both food and drink (tostadas are always on the menu). Other favourites: pork belly tacos, vegetarian burgers, regular burgers (they bake they own buns, and those are brioche buns!!). There is an ample selection of boutique beers and drinks made with freshly squeezed juices and home-made spirits. Definitely order seared carrot cake dessert with chevre whip topping. Worth the trip from anywhere in Phoenix.",

    "text": "I have passed this place several times and always thought it wouldn't make it because of the kind of out of the way location. A chef buddy of mine had me meet him there for a drink and I can say now I wish I started coming earlier. The food is great and the beer selection is awesome. I'm a big fan of the gourmet tots that change daily. I've now tried things here that I never would have other places since the chef will occasionally surprise us. I love sitting at the bar and talking to the staff. A buddy recently ordered some sort of whisky tea drink that came with a french press I think and the bartender did a heck of a presentation and she was super friendly. It is safe to say I now know when other Chefs tell you to go somewhere it is worth listening. This is basically an unpretentious gastro pub that takes chances on the food and beer list and does it well. I crave those tots at least once a week and always wonder what hard to find new beer will be on tap. Great place.",

From the outside it seems upscale, on the inside it feels like a comfortable dive type bar. Seems as though they're trying to create an upscale menu for \"Scottsdale\", but falls short in atmosphere, location and food. The fish was a small portion and a bit over cooked, the burger had a burnt grill taste and no mayo in the building??? and the Fries were WAAAAY overdone. When  we asked about it they said they were supposed to be that way... double fried :/ Yuck, and completely Inedible. Few beers on tap, and the four peaks beers come in a CAN... and it was Gross! Possibly there are other items on the menu that would be better But We are unwilling to give them another try at those prices. My suggestion is don't waste your money, there are better options in Scottsdale for price, atmosphere and comfort ability",

    "text": "I arrived before my party, hungry. It was a Friday night, I was sat in a high top, near the bar. I ordered an app right away..a crispy rock shrimp($14). The remoulade was to die for, with diced kalamata. I ordered the ribeye with gratin potatoes for my entree ($27). My other 2 guests arrived, and ordered a burger, and 2 add ons of pork belly. Here's where it gets murky..one pork belly dish arrived, so we thought it was the two sides combined, then a few mins later, another small side appears, we send it back, because we thought we already had received ours, it turns out, when we get the check he rang us in for 2 pork belly appetizers (received only one app plate) I was trying to eat my ribeye, and explain to the server what had happened, (he seemed super busy, and impatient the whole experience, rushing my friends through their orders.) He took the app that we didn't order, or receive off, thankfully..but still charged us full price for the one we didn't order. The steak was great paired with the remoulade that I'm in love with, the gratin was cold in the middle. Sad. The service was rushed, and towards the end, the hostess approached us, and asked if we, meaning my friend and I would help her move our table, so the band could set up. She looked shocked when I simply replied \"no\". The place doubles as an art gallery, which is neat, but they were featuring about 4 different artists, with 4 different color schemes, and even varying styles. Pretty painful to the eye. All in all, it's an okay place set in a stip mall, decorated with the Sunday comics.",

The waiters were all really nice, and accommodating. We had a larger group, so that they pushed tables together right away. Everyone was impressed with their drink, but mine was the best by far! I highly recommend the cilantro margarita! It was the best margarita I've ever had, hands down! Another thing I had to try (but wasn't quite as impressed with) was the bone marrow. I knew I wanted to try it, but it wasn't easy to eat. I definitely don't regret trying it tho. The serving was huge! (Which I was glad for because it was $16) if everyone just had 1 or 2 bites, you could share this between 8! For us, 1 or 2 bites was good enough when you are eating what tastes like pure fat haha. But they kicker was at the end... you can get \"the ludge!\" They pour a shot of bourbon down the empty bone you just ate all the marrow out of! It was actually tasty and lots of fun! Great experience!",

In a place called \"Pig N Pickle\", you expect the pork belly to be the ace in the hole...in other words, the most delectable of all the dishes. Sorry, I had better pork belly before. I'll go back again of course, just not for the pork belly.",

    "text": "Pig and pickle... This place came highly recommended by friends so we decided to give it a try.   Service was ok. The waiter forgot to bring our side of shredded pork despite three reminders. Oh well...not the biggest issue. Drinks were ok. The \"special\" hoop-Dee drink at $13 didn't live up to the hype.   We got the pork tostadas with kimchi for appetizers which we really enjoyed. Only disappointment was the kimchi was not spicy. It was either white kimchi or they washed the kimchi of its red pepper. However, we were delighted with the amount of juicy succulent shredded pork on top of the tostadas. I probably could've eaten two servings of these for dinner.  My husband got the Apocalypse Sow burger. True to its name, it's a heart attack/cholesterol buster neatly packaged between two pieces of bread. But it was delicious. Who can say no to various pieces of pork piled on top of each other?  I had the burger with dump truck salad side. The burger was ok. Nothing fabulous. The dump truck salad was nothing phenomenal either. It was an interesting mixture of veggies to include chopped cauliflower. But in my honest opinion, the salad dressing lacked any flavor whatsoever. I was a bit underwhelmed.  But let's get to the pickle spear that comes with your burger. I was very disappointed for an establishment that has \"pickle\" in its name to put a pickle so sour and tart it makes your eyes water on its plates. It wasn't only me that has such a reaction to my bite into the pickle. The whole table of 6 agreed. So I can honestly vouch it wasn't just me... :(   sorry pig & pickle you under delivered on the pickle...",

    "text": "We found this place because our flights got in late on a weeknight and we didn't want fast food. We ended up being some of the only people in there but that did not effect the service at all. We ordered a variety of things: charcuterie, udon noodles, dump truck salad, Brussels sprouts and mac 'n cheese. I'm certain that the volume in there dropped significantly when we got our food because our talking was replaced by happy eating noises. Everything was wonderful! Ordering a ton of things and sharing was definitely the way to go -- it worked out that different things were different people's favorites, so no awkward point near the end of the meal deciding who got the last of what.  This was such a great beginning to our vacation, and we bookended the deal by eating here again before we went to the airport to travel back home.",

The food was pretty good and the cocktails were alright. The waiter didn't seem like he bothered. He was very short with us and took forever to take our drink order. The restaurant had little to no patrons. He didn't seem like he should be bothered. I will come again during the daytime when the menu is more expansive and the staff is more courteous.",

We sat and got served promptly. The drinks we both had were good. For the entrees we shared the mussels and the hanger steak. The mussels were ok; the broth was lacking something. The skirt steak we got was better though. We ordered it medium and it was pre-sliced for us, which made it easier for us to share.   In my opinion, this place was decent. The server was friendly, and they didn't have music very loud or anything so that was nice since my friend and I were catching up. If I'm looking for a place that I can get sat quickly within old town, I might come back here to try it.",

As we browsed the menu and bonded with the restaurant's mission of serving the best organic food, we were caught between different Sammies. Would the Peruvian mustard satiate us tonight or the steak? Alas, all of it would. Boasting its selection of specially brewed beer, the restaurant led us to try some of the carefully crafted IPAs. And if you don't finish with the strawberry compote pie, you're just not ready to accept all that heaven has to offer the earthlings. We, New Yorkers, are in love with this spot.

I ate it because I was worried I'd be there all night waiting for the correct food.  I'm glad I did because it was ones of the best steaks I've ever had.

    "text": "My Dad and I came in for lunch today. I have been wanting to retry this place since I moved back in the area.  Stood at the front for a couple of minutes wondering if we should wait or seat ourselves... Finally the female bartender came out from behind the bar and told us to pick a spot and she brought over menus.   We ordered the Cuban sandwich and Brussels to share... The bartender/server talked us into getting the tots as our.   Water glasses were empty the majority of the time. When food came out it was cold, the bread was burnt on our sandwich, and the Brussels were cold and extremely greasy. Our girl never came back to check in and so we semi ate our food be we were both extremely hungry. Overall the Brussels were not touched and both of us tore apart out sandwiches to eat what was edible. For too very hungry people we maybe ate 30% of our food. My Dad said all of the fries food tasted like old oil and joked that the kitchen must have been too busy cleaning and breaking down lunch service than cooking our food.  When she finally came back to clear out plates she asked how everything was... My Dad is very straightforward and he told her the Brussels were greasy and the sandwich wasn't very good... She said \"sorry about that\".  Bill came, tots were an up charge and were terrible... I'm definitely not cheap, but don't hard sell a side for $2 that was cold and barely eaten. No attempt to fix or rectify the comments made about the food. I definitely don't expect comps, but at least some acknowledgment of way below par food and customer feedback. We put cash in the book and she asked if we needed any change... Yes I need change back! So unprofessional and rude. There are much more professional ways to ask.  This was one of my worst experiences overall as of late between service and food. Many people has told me this place had gone downhill, but I wanted to give it another try. My Dad had a bad first and last impression and we both left hungry.",

We ended up very happy that it was.      I had the Biscuits and Gravy for Sunday brunch and my friend had the Chorizo Scramble type of dish.       Mine was wonderful, though they should cut the biscuits in half so it makes four then add gravy. It would be more enjoyable. Adding a couple of tomato slices would be good too.      My friend and I were apprehensive about his Chorizo dish. They make their own and when most places do, it isn't that good. This place is totally the opposite. The Chorizo was fresh, spicy hot and full of flavor. It was FANTASTIC. They should turn it into a dip and serve it as a app later in the day.      Simple put, this place rocks the Pig!

But compared to the braised duck, it wasn't spectacular. Nonetheless a very good cut of meat.  The most conflicting part of our dinner was the dessert: sear carrot cake. The cake was moist and delicious. The goat cheese glaze had the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. The carrot chips were perfectly crispy. The peppered caramel sauce, sweet and peppery.

(Insert the Monty Python Spam song here but use Pig instead of the spam word.) With a daily changing menu.  Long Story  They have many interesting starter plates we picked the pickles and the cheese plate so we could have variety . The pickle plate was colorful and impressive. Each vegetable or fruit I tried all tasted different and was interesting. I thought the cheese plate was very good since it was made of better cheeses  , it also was a good sharing size.   We had a Pork Porterhouse that was perfect and came with well seasoned beans and we also had a trout dish that differed from the on-line menu example but was delicious and prepared masterfully . Both dishes were light with the vegetables. The only real starch on the trout plate was the breading from the shrimp.  Decided to try a dessert since most have pig in them so we went for a less piggy option and tried the pretzel bread pudding topped with the BEST IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD peanut butter ice-cream. A yummy blackberry complimented this dessert making it taste like a yummy peanut butter and jelly sandwich. This dessert was nearly perfect my only criticism is that the bread pudding was chewy and hard but it was so tasty I ate it anyway.  Our server was very well trained and knew the menu well.  The ladies room was clean and nice but the stall was extremely small with the door opening in instead of out so even if you are tiny it's hard to get out.  Very solid very good.",

    "text": "I think I over-hyped this place in my mind. A restaurant called Pig and Pickle can only be absolutely mind blowing. All of my friends agreed so of course this is now fact. Unfortunately, my mind was not blown.   We came for the late night menu and Industry discount (15% off!). The atmosphere is open and spacious with subtle pig artwork scattered here and there. It's got a small bar with a great selection of craft beers and high end liquors. The cocktail menu is a bit pricey, but the drinks are well made and pretty damn boozey (the Mai Tai will knock you on your ass).   The service was ... eh. The guy was super nice so I feel bad speaking negatively about him, but facts is facts. The drinks took a noticeably long time to arrive, and I would definitely have ordered a second had the first one not take about ten minutes to make an appearance. Apparently, the bartender was \"spacing out\". I couldn't care less about a spacing out bartender, I just want my alcohol.  The food was good. Solidly good, but like I said, I am not reeling from the foodgasm of piggy goodness. We ordered a round of Tots with their special sauce. For $1 each, get them! The filling changes daily and they're creamy and crunchy and comfort food delicious. Think hush puppy mashed potato mega-tot.   I had a hard time picking my meal because honestly, the whole menu looks awesome. I ended up with a $9 Burger. You've got three choices for cheese- cheddar, swiss or havarti. I went with Havarti and a side salad. After thinking about it, I opted to add Bacon for $2.50. We had an entire conversation about how dumb it would be NOT to add bacon at a Pig place! Yeah well... the guy forgot to add the bacon. Annoying. I wasn't charged for it, but I also really would have liked to eat it. Meh.   After the industry discount and my unnecessarily large, and guilt driven tip, my meal alone cost a little over $20. That's kinda pricey for a late night meal. Especially with such underwhelming service. It's frustrating because I like the guy, and being in the same profession, I understand wanting to be buddy-buddy with a fellow server- but DUDE. Do Not mess up my meal or my drinks. Then and only then can we be friends.   I will come back for sure, but I'm not kicking babies and tossing the elderly out of my way to get there.",

Everything we ordered was outstanding. Make sure you are sharing the small plates because they are actually pretty hefty portions. Beer selection was decent, nothing out of this world. Some breweries were local and unknown to me. Others were not so special. They do a tasting flight with hefty 6 or 8oz pours in mason jar like glasses. My only qualm was that the interior space is massive and tables are far apart or high up in the air giving an awkward, vulnerable dining experience rather than cozy and intimate.",

Three occupied tables  in the whole place (what does that tell you?). Asked to split a $14 cuban sandwich, with two sides, NBD. Sandwich is delivered to the table on one plate. I ask the foodrunner/server if the chef will split it for us. Waiter sniffs, and says, \"That's what THAT is for!\" and nods at a steak knife on the table. Really? Saunters back and leaves our food in the open window until the cook can be found to cut it in half.  Unfortunately, it kind of went downhill from there. The Cuban had sweet pickles and not the expected dill. Had they been really good, it would have been NP. But this was a serious mound (as much as the meat) and we both had to pull them off. Over- dressed mustardy buns (and I love mustard too), a blandly dressed salad (too bad, the veggies were fresh), and the star of lunch - two potato \"tots\" - the whole experience averaged out to a really mediocre lunch. Even the dill pickle served on the plate was so vinegary tart I had to spit it out. And I love vinegar!   Between the snotty food runner (our main server was good) the disappointing mashup of my favorite foods, and pricey lunch menu, I won't be back. I'll get my pig and pickle fix elsewhere.",

I had the Cubano sandwich with fries and a sweet pickle and it was excellent. Since I had to go back to work, I stuck with a Coke, and they have the Mexican Cokes in the glass bottle. However, I noticed that they have an excellent selection of craft beers, including two of my favorites, Ninkasi and Dogfish Head, along with a large selection of wine and other cocktails. I also saw a couple be seated on the patio with their dog and the bartender took an actual water bowl out for the pup, which seems like a great idea. I am definitely a fan, and will no doubt be back again... hopefully when I'm not working so I can have a good beer with my meal!",

Tip: if you feel like lamb and you're all about the food instead of atmosphere, try the lamb chops Marsala from uncle Sal's Italian restaurant down the street...

Months ago, I was having one of the worst weeks at university, stresses piling on, 8 hours of homework each night. It was a nightmare. I was at my limit (you know that feeling, where you just want to tear your textbook in half and throw your computer off your balcony?) but then thought to myself, \"You know what would make me happier than anything right now? A delicious Pig & Pickle BLT.\" So I headed over, dreaming of one of the best BLTs I've ever had, and how it would soon make my stresses drift away. Flavorful pork belly, tasty pesto, and juicy tomatoes. It even made my 'not-impressed-by-BLTs' fiance a believer.  Lo and behold, when I sat down and opened my menu... it was no longer there. I asked our server, and he confirmed. And (here's the confession part) I totally went to the parking lot and cried. Seriously. SO! Overall lesson (aside from not to put all your hopes and dreams into food): Yes, their food is *that good.*  Also, Pig & Pickle, I'm moving nearby. So if you decide to bring back that BLT, I'd be forever grateful (and probably forever occupying your restaurant).",

Pig & pickle has a bit of an identity crisis though.  It's like casual pizzeria meets upscale gastro pub combined with anything pig related.  On the walls you'll find local art you can purchase and on the bar shelf you'll see are two plastic pigs humping.     The servers are very knowledgeable about food and are quite helpful, yet the bartenders goof around as if they are coffee baristas.  The drink menu's are awesome and the food choices are some of my favorite.  Unfortunately while the menu looks great, the food fails to deliver.  Love bone marrow - just not here.  It could have used some more time and the whatever bread crumb topping just didn't go.  In-house chorizo - nice touch - but I've had better at breakfast joints.  I really wanted to give this place 4 stars because it's the kind of place I like.  Underwhelming food made me want to give it 2 stars.  The charcuterie was great though - variety of meats and pickles - that deserves a star in itself.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Pig & Pickle for some time now. Luckily, since my co-workers know I'm a foodie, they gifted me $50 giftcard to try Pig & Pickle. I grabbed my husband and we hustled down for Happy Hour. Happy Hour runs from 4 - 6pm daily and they have plenty of appetizers for $5 and numerous drink choices. Since we wanted to make the most of our experience, we ordered three items off the Happy Hour menu.   First, we ordered pork tacos. I am not going to lie - these were the best thing we ate all night. If we had only ordered the tacos, we would have been in hog heaven - pun intended. The pork was flavorful and spicy with a tender slice of avocado on top. Only two came to an order, but they were perfectly delicious. After trying the other menu items, I wish we had just ordered more of the tacos.  Next, we ordered the pork tostadas. This was pork shoulder with ginger aioli, kimchi, and scallions. The pork, while extremely tender, was flavorless. The kimchi (pickled cabbage) was off putting - after one bite, I picked all the kimchi off. Even my husband, who normally likes kimchi, commented on how off it tasted. Needless to say, we were not impressed.  For our final appetizer, we ordered the chef's choice house made charcuterie. This came with some pickled vegetables, several meats, a spicy mustard, a bacon jam, and two types of bread. Let me just say, the house made bread was fantastic. It was soft and flavorful. My husband enjoyed the bacon jam and I liked the spicy mustard. The pickled vegetables were meh. (There were pickled pearl onions, pickled green beans, and to quote the waitress, \"pickled pickles\".) I don't remember the exact names of the types of meat except there were three of them - one being a pork sausage. Again, we weren't very impressed with the selection.  For dinner, my husband ordered the littleneck clams with chorizo and a side of pork belly. The clams were in a white wine sauce with herbs and tomatoes. I tried a slice of the chorizo and it was tasty, but overall my husband didn't really like the meal. Even the pork belly, which he loves, was just \"okay\".   I ordered the smoked pot roast sandwich. This came with Havarti, caramelized onions, and creamy horseradish on a hoagie roll. I had the option of French fries or a small salad and decided to go with the fries. The fries were both good and bad at the same time. They had a nice flavor to them, but they didn't seem cooked all the way through. You know how you bake a potato and sometimes the inside isn't cooked - it's in that half stage of being slightly tender but chewy? That's how all the fries were. Which is definitely not the norm for fries but it was so odd that I kept eating them, trying to see if it was all of them or just one. (It was all of them.) The sandwich also gave me mixed feelings. The roast itself was tender but flavorless. When combining all the sandwich flavors, it actually tasted good. (The onions really complimented the roast and the horseradish gave everything a spicy kick.) Overall, it was a decent sandwich but nothing to rave about.  In the end, we used our entire giftcard. My husband commented that he was glad we had a giftcard so we could try everything but that he wouldn't go back. I agreed and we probably won't be back. Mainly, the food was just \"okay\" (except  the tacos - if you do go, get the tacos) and the restaurant is about 30 minutes away from us. It's hard to justify driving 30 minutes for \"okay\" food. The service was nice. Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and prompt. She helped us decide on what to order when we had questions and gave us her opinion on dishes.  Overall, the restaurant is a neat idea - everything is house made and fresh but the execution/flavor was just lacking. If we are ever in the neighborhood, we might give it a second chance but who knows when that will be.",

First my favorite is there cilantro margarita  with sirracha- you think this would be weird because I did and my friend made me try it... I'm hooked.. I'm dream of these things they are so good!! The Brussels sprouts are just unreal- crispy with sprinkled cheese and a friend egg!  Not a fan of the green chili Mac and cheese- not a lot of flavor and wasn't hot at all.  Now I am admitting to have tried the pork- the tostadas and pork belly tacos are seriously unreal. They almost converted me over.",

I'd strongly suggest the bone marrow and once you've finished the marrow wash it down with the bone marrow bourbon shot (just as Scotty the bartender!).",

Upon arrival we were being up charged. We started will the brussel sprouts which were inedible as they were drenched in oil. They are deep fried and all we could taste was the oil. They were disgustingly greasy. Our waiter tried to up-sell us from the beginning of our meal. Immediately, he asked, \"would you like to try _____ or _____?\" Of course these were the two most expensive items on the menu. He also asked us if we would \"like to add bacon or pork\" onto two separate dishes. By the time we finished ordering, we were tired of being pestered to add to our dishes.   When our main dishes came out they both looked great. However both of our dishes had no taste what so ever. Maybe the greasy brussel sprouts had something to do with that.   The prices at pig and pickle also seem to be a little high for being in a run down strip center. I am very disappointed that this was our last dinner in Arizona. It",

I ordered the tater tots with my meal and dipped in the sauce that came with them was also an excellent experience. Wife had the Dump Truck salad and was impressed with that too. She also ordered a side of a bread plate and it came with 3 different spreads. All were delicious. They were smoked butter, bacon jam and apricot jam. Wife says \"all 3 spreads were fantastic\". She also liked the assortment of breads. One drawback is that it is a bit pricey. Just as an added note, the evening Menu is printed fresh every day at about 4PM (so I was told). The menu changes according to what he has fresh and available. Any Menus posted in here may not be the same when you get there. We got there at 3:30PM and got given the \"Happy Hour\" menu with drinks and a short list of \"appetizers\". So we ordered drinks, waited 30 minutes and got the freshly printed menus for that evening. then we pigged out !!!!",

Being only a stone throw from my sister's house and open until late, it was a perfect spot when we decided to do a late dessert before I left early the next morning back home.  At 10:30 pm, the run a \"late night menu\" which had limited yet with variety selection of entrees and desserts.  It also had some recommended drinks.   Being a non-drinker, I have to go by the drinkers' opinions which were that the drinks were good. Upon investigation of the drink menu, an obscure ingredient made these two Hawaii girls go, hmmm. Li hing mui. Upon further investigation we found out that the bartender was originally from Hawaii.  Cool point.   Dessert... ah, even on this late menu, was unique and interesting.  At this late hour, one would be forgiving if a place just offered a slice of pie with ice cream on the side. Not here.  The were individually prepared and it took time to get it.    I'll say this much, when an employee/our server knows all the owners and their history, points them all out at 10:30 on a weeknight, and gushes about their hard work, ability to collaborate and be original; you as business owners, are doing something right.     Overall it seems that this place is ambitious and willing to take the risk, exert the extra energy and push the bill to get people to see that they are not a joke when it comes to creating an original experience.  I can safely say this, on this Tuesday night, by the time we left at about midnight, the place was even more crowded then when we came.    I am definitely coming back again to try their regular menu.",

My drink was similar to a Mai Tai, a little bit fruitier, with a generous amount of rum. Very good for a hot night.  We ate the following: Charcuterie plate - a large mix of meats, lots of salami, and pickled goods, it event included pickled grapes, very interesting! Beer Cheese Soup - so rich and flavorful, the cheddar really popped and the chunks of crispy bacon really added to the dish, I think this is the best cheddar ale soup I've ever had Bone Marrow - I had never eaten this before, it was fantastic here, we spread it on pretzel bread with bacon jam Lobster roll - nice serving of lobster, with homemade chips on the side Mussels - this came with a wonderful wine sauce and chorizo Duck - fell right off the bone, served over a perfectly cooked risotto Seared Carrot Cake - worth coming here just for this, the most creative carrot cake I've ever had. It was a seared block of cake, topped with goat cheese frosting, candied fried carrots, and pistachios and raisins. A must try!  Our server was fantastic, she had a great personality and was really on point with recommendations. I will definitely return!",

The menu we saw through the Yelp pages were different from the menu we got.  When we arrived, we got the brunch menu.  It was still good but I wished we could have ordered from the dinner menu.  So when we're in Phoenix again, we will go there for dinner.    We got there around 11:30am and got seated in about 15 minutes so the wait wasn't too long.   We ordered the following:  Bacon & Cheddar Waffle with Bourbon Maple Syrup ($10): So good, lots of bacon bits.    Croque Madam ($13): it was huge!!!  Lots of ham, cheese and a thick piece of bread.  There was more meat than bread so that was a plus for me.    Side of pork belly ($4): it was OK, I don't know why I always order pork belly when I see it on the menu, I really don't like eating pieces of fat.    Side of bacon ($4): we got so much bacon where we thought that we got 3 sides of bacon!  Biscuits and Gravy ($12): my husband said that it was a little spicy and very filling.   Dylon, Dylon, Dylon, Dylon & Dylon ($8):  this was the disappointed drink I ordered.  It has Pineapple Thai Chili Vodka, passion orange juice, fresh sour, soda and a spicy candied pineapple.  It didn't have the candied pineapple and they told me that they ran out a while back.  I ordered this drink because of the candied pineapple.  I was so bummed.   I will definitely go back to try their dinner menu, after that I will do a total body cleanse with all the fat I would have consumed with just one meal.",

Drive from wherever you are to this restaurant while you're in the are.  Bacon flight?  Yes!  The ambience is casual.  The menu is spectacularly unique.  I've never had a breakfast like fried Brussels sprouts with an egg on top.  But it was one of the best breakfast meals I've ever had.  The fresh cut bacon on the side made this a meal to die for.  Go for breakfast, can't recommend it enough.",

    "text": "I have a ten month old lab that wreaks havoc whenever he's left at home alone, so I'm always on the lookout for dog friendly restaurants. Our waitress was awesome, and immediately brought my pup a bowl of water and a gigantic house made dog treat, which he gobbled down in about two seconds. Between that and the amazing happy hour, Pig and Pickle is one of our new favorite hangouts! Happy hour goes from 3 to 6 daily, and they have an awesome selection of draft beers, cocktails, and wine for only $5. I loved the #scottsdaleproblems, with prosecco, house limoncello, lime zest, and tiki bitters. Their mac and cheese with pepper jack and green chilies is absolutely amazing. You have the option of adding a hefty portion of house smoked pork belly for $4 - best decision ever. And speaking of great decisions, you should definitely get a few of their tot of the day. These things are MASSIVE, way bigger than golf balls; the tot du jour for our visit was bacon and feta - I could've eaten a dozen of those babies. I don't know what crazy magic goes into their aioli either, but it is so addictive! My friend KJ got the pickle plate, which was definitely interesting. I'm not a huge fan of pickles in general (I know, blasphemy) but this plate was something else entirely! They had pickled EVERYTHING, from regular bread and butter pickles and green beans to watermelon rind, cauliflower, egg, fennel and onions. The pickled grapes were surprisingly good. Pickle lover or not, you and your pup will definitely find something you'll enjoy at the P&P!",

My Shrimp and Grits was fabulous with the lightest grits and a touch of spicy sausage. My son's Ciopinno  was delicious. The vinegar pie sounded odd for desert  but was very good, served with strawberry compote and fresh whipped cream. The bad : very poor service.  In all fairness,  it was a very busy Friday night,  but, still, not acceptable. Our waiter spent a good amount of time socializing with the chefs at the open kitchen instead of tending to business. Go on an off night or off hours...by 8pm the place was not so crowded.",

The mimosa was wonderful, you could tell the orange juice was fresh squeezed. They had items on the menu I had actually never even heard of but after the waiter gave a little bit of an explanation, they were merely just fancy names. I got the biscuits, eggs and pork gravy. It had a really complex name but it was basically just sunny side-up eggs, southern style biscuits in gravy with pork pieces instead of ground sausage. I would definitely recommend, it was great spot for brunch!",

It was all great!   The cheese plate featured delicious bread, apricot preserves, dried cherries and delicious almonds along with two types of cheese: one soft and one semi-soft.   The chicharrones were still crackling for several minutes after being brought to the table. As fresh as they were they were not too hot to eat -- which is important because the snaps and pops made us want to dig in SO bad! They were crisp and had just the right amount of salt and paprika. It was a pretty big portion... with three of us enjoying them, there were still a few to take home!  The Cuban sandwich was GREAT! Each component: the ham, the pulled pork and the cheese were delicious on their own; and, together: they were out of this world! For my side, I chose the tots which are really more like mini potato croquets. Think: breaded and fried balls of creamy mashed potatoes! How could that NOT be good, right?",

    "text": "After hearing some buzz on this place we finally got the opportunity to try it this evening. I had seen the menu online and thought it looked enticing and also upscale, so I was surprised when we walked in and the atmosphere was very casual. There are lots of cute and clever pictures and details that give it charm and character, but the tables and seating arrangements aren't exactly comfortable or fine dining.   Our waiter was friendly and got us our drinks promptly, but seemed very busy and to have too much to handle for one guy. We got the cheese and jam app as well as the brussel sprouts and both were good, but not great. The cheese and jam app was $5 during happy hour which was reasonable, but I would not pay full price for it, and the brussel sprouts were $9 and definitely not $9 worth of deliciousness. We ordered burgers with fries, a side salad, and the halibut with corn fritters. The burgers were juicy, but the flavor was not very good (tasted like bad meatloaf); the fries however were excellent. I asked for aioli on the side and for being one of their special sauces it tasted exactly like a blob of mayonnaise. The halibut was well cooked and decent, and the corn fritters were ok. Clever menu, but it is very pricey for the lack of flavor that they serve.   Our waiter was MIA for long periods of time, and got some of our orders a bit off. He corrected it no problem and was very nice, but it took him far too long to get our check among other things. Poor guy just had too many tables and responsibilities to handle by himself. Pig and Pickle is a super cute and clever concept, but it is pretty expensive for mediocre food, casual ambience, and slow service.",

    "text": "It's always a bummer to see a spot you enjoyed in the past- slide downhill in such palpable fashion.   I used to come here for brunch and happy hour. When a friend I haven't seen in a long time suggested getting drinks- I said let's hit P&P.   Got there a bit after 4 and the place was empty except for one high top.  I found my friend and joined her. It took a looong time to have anyone check on our table, which is odd since it was dead. I tried to order a drink off the happy hour menu but they were missing an ingredient.  I was surprised there was no offer to substitute something else or offer an alternative. Instead I said I guess I needed more time. My friend suggested I just get that drink minus one ingredient, since it would likely taste good anyway. When the server came back I asked to do that, and she seemed totally flummoxed and said she didn't know if they could do that- but she would check with the bar. Five minutes later my drink shows up and miraculously the missing ingredient is now back in stock.   For food we ordered pork tacos and an order of Mac and cheese. Both items were $5 on happy hour; and the server asked if we wanted to add pork belly into the Mac and cheese. I assumed it would be an extra buck, or maybe a little more- but I had to laugh when the bill arrived and it was an extra $4 for some bubble gum-like pork belly. The add-on costs nearly the full price as the dish its supposed to enhance.   The tacos were TINY. If you've ever seen the YouTube videos of the hamsters eating tiny food- then you've seen  this food.  I understand it's a happy hour small plate situation- but it was still pretty weak.  The Mac and cheese was abysmal. It looked like Mac and cheese but had no discernible flavor of any kind. It was so odd. The dish desperately needed salt, as it was so so so bland. Sadly the table also needed salt but there was none, and our server was no where to be found.   Another odd thing that killed the ambiance, as there were two streams of music. The overhead music and then the kitchen was blasting death metal, at an oddly high volume. I love music and like to hear it everywhere- but when it is blasting into a dining area, that's just unprofessional  and basically sends and overall message of apathy- which makes sense when you take into account the poor service, tasteless food, and garbage drinks.   I don't know what the hell happened to this once great place- but if I were the owners I would be pretty nervous about my future. I wish this place all the best- but they gotta get this figured out.",

    "text": "We were in search of late night eats after flying into PHX at 9:30 since most non fast food places close around 10.  The name immediately caught my eye as pork and pickles are things I love to eat.  We arrived  around 11 pm.  There were a few patrons dining inside and at the bar as well as outside on the patio.  The late night menu was a good size as were looking for a light meal.  We ordered the tot of the day.  It's more of a potato croquette, but for $1, it's absolutely worth getting 1 per person.  The aioli had a nice spice and flavor to it.  We ordered the pickled things and our faves were the grapes and beets.  We dipped the pickled egg in the aioli.  I think that combo would make an awesome pickled deviled egg or pickled egg salad sandwich.  The liver and caramelized onion smear on toast was tasty, especially if you are a pate fan.  The smear had an interesting smoky taste.  At $4, it's a steal. My bf had the burger and fries.  He said the burger was good but nothing special.  I ordered the shrimp and grits.  The portion size was large.  It wasn't what I expected.  It was more like a shrimp, sausage, and tomato stew on top of grits.  It was too spicy for my taste, but the cheesy grits had me going back for more as I wanted every last bit of grits.  I would have been happy with mostly grits and a few sauteed shrimp.  Overall, the meal was excellent.  With tax and tip, the 2 of us were well fed for $40.",

    "text": "Holy foodgasm!  That's a direct quote from dinner here with my friends last week.  We went on a Friday, which I would NOT recommend; the was quite a long wait to get seated.  Service was good, but a little blatantly one sided.  Maybe the server could actually address then entire table, and not just the hot chick....not so subtle my friend, I'm just sayin.    The food here was good.  They didn't reinvent the wheel, or even try to. The menu is a random assortment of someone's favorite foods, each one seemingly executed well.  There is a note on the menu that substitutions will be politefully declined.  I was concerned about this, as with my food allergies, eating out can be tricky.  They were more than willing to serve me a custom grind burger sans bun, with extra lettuce for wrapping.  It came out deconstructed on the plate, with a bowl of fries.  I was disappointed at first that I wasn't offered any dipping options for my fries, but once I tasted them, I understood why.  These fries were excellent. They stood alone, and anything to dip them in would have been an injustice.  Then I tasted my burger. One of my friends also had a burger with the bun and 2 hilariously large tots, and the other had a vegetable casserole? (If I remember correctly). There was a collective silence at the table as we all had our first bite, and stared at each other in disbelief.  No one could believe how simplistically good the food was, and the fact that we all thought so, that's an almost impossible feat.  As a group. We rarely agree on anything food related.    I think the drinks were overhyped a bit.  I had a Moscow mule, which was ok, but not exceptional by any means.  The waiter helped my friend select a beer which she seemed to enjoy.  This place is more Scottsdale than I expected, but that wouldn't stop me from returning; I'd just pick a different night to avoid the wait.",

He gave great descriptions of the menu items and was very attentive. The food was good and to my surprise somewhat gourmet, considering the name of the place. Don't  be afraid all the food may be or contain pork; they have other options such as chicken, salmon or vegan plates. A place worth trying!",

    "text": "I have been to the Pig and Pickle a couple of times now. The first time I ordered the dump truck salad as I am not a meat eater but my friend was. The salad was fresh and large and the dressing was fresh as well. My friend had the Pot Roast sammie which he stated was very good. The service was very good  although it was restaurant week, we were able to get in and out in a timely manner.   I went again last night with my brother I decided to try the vegetarian burger which came with fries, it was very good and flavorful with some fresh veggies on top and good temperature the fries were hot and fresh as well. My only complaint would be the fries were extremely salty. I used the hot sauce to tone down the salt a bit. I am a type of person that will not send food back for any reason, and we were also in a hurry. My brother ordered the Pot Roast and he stated that this was very good. We did not order drinks but I have had their drinks in the past which is a good selection of wine and beer.   For the price you get good service and food, my only suggestion would be is to not add any salt to the fries and have salt and pepper on the tables along with serving the condiments with the food so the wait staff does not have to make several tips for condiments along with not having to wait to eat your food waiting for the condiments.   For vegetarians they have the nancy'...brie, avocado, tomato and shaved red onion on garlic rubbed bread ,the dump truck salad and  the vegetarian burger. Not too many choices but at least you can find something on the menu.",

The pickle plate had everything on it from actual pickles to onions, eggs, beets and mushrooms. Very yummy.   I had a \"dump truck\" salad - I guess they call it that because everything is dumped in it. Delicious. For the main course I ordered the pot roast sammy minus the bread, so they served it in a cast iron pan. It was just great, huge portions. My husband enjoyed the beer selection and a juicy cheeseburger. The service was excellent, the restaurant was clean and everyone was friendly. We will return!",

They have some menu items that are on the exotic side, such as the bone marrow, and for the less adventurous items as simple as burgers. I have ordered menu items on both ends of the spectrum and was equally impressed with them. The Steaks I have tried have been perfectly cooked and seasoned and even the greens they are served with are fancy and delicious. I ordered the burger on another occasion and would say that it was one of the better burgers I've had in the city. The fried egg on top of the burger really hit the spot. Pig & Pickle has been busy every time I've been there and has great ambiance, great service, and most importantly great food.",

The third time was with a larger group of 7. Food was ok generally, but my duck with huitlacoche was just mushrooms being passed off as huitlacoche. Service was decent. Last time will be last time. Made a reservation for a specific table. When we got there the table wasn't ready. No problem, but it irked me when the hostess pointed at the couple still in the table we had reserved and sighed. It was like she was passing the buck even though it wasn't necessary. We wait about 15 minutes and then the hostess gets us and proceeds to take us to a different table. I look over at the one I had reserved. It was empty and just needed to be cleaned off. I told her that that was the table we had been waiting for. She let us move, saying that she just wanted to get us seated. I can't imagine why she thought it would've been a problem to make us wait a couple more minutes to clean off the table we wanted. Then as she cleaned it she once again passed the unnecessary buck by blaming our delay on the person who took the reservation. It was weird. Ok. We're seated. We wait 10 min for water. Finally the waiter comes. By then we know the drinks and appetizers we want. We have to almost force the waiter to take them. He obviously wanted to only take the drink order. We wait a half hour before the drinks and appetizers arrive. No waiter visits during that time, and different people bring them. However, the waiter is continually visiting the tables of young women behind us and in front as well as doting on a larger group. He's busy but I can't figure out why we're ignored. By the time we're done, still no waiter. I had tried to convince my wife and brother to leave before the appetizers arrived. They weren't having it. After another 20 minutes after the appetizers were done, they just want to leave. Finally, almost an hour after we sat down, we get the second waiter visit. He just kinda irritatingly asks if we know what we want. No specials. No bread. Etc., even though he asked all the other tables he was doting on. I said, \"just the check.\" He got annoyed we weren't ordering. Brought the check. Left no tip. Adios forever. We went to the Citizens Public House instead, which has much better food for the same price.",

    "text": "It's one of my fav new places! I love comfort food. I know what you are thinkin, why would a vegetarian like me, love comfort food! Well it's the overall package, & it's not like my most fav food, but I like what they do with their okras, hush puppies ( even though it was meant for puppies :p), greens & beans, Mac & cheese, etc. ok enough with the general comfort food, lets talk about P & P.   We went there on a sunday Night, was busy for a sunday night, the place looks interesting inside, looks like a combination of a sports bar and a restaurant but isn't neither. Our waitress was  friendly but a lil' sarcastic maybe? I can't remember her name though ofc. Apparently she can't take it when the customers get indecisive (bcs of the lovely options in the menu) and are not ready to order the food even when she came back like 3 times in 7 mins.   Anyways to the food, my buddy was like woah they have a lot of veggie options for being a pig place. I was hello, remember it has a pickle in it too. :) Oh wait the drinks, aah i posted a pic of their drinks, have a couple of interesting drinks in there. another buddy of mine got a side car, it was meh! I was in mood for something hoppy, so just got myself a left hand IPA. Their beer selection is good as well.   I was contemplating between the vegan burger or the shepards pie. On the waitress's insistence I had to go with the pie. I liked the pie, even though it was bland as it could be. Don't think there was any seasoning in it, but was filling. Had potatoes, lentils, cheese, and stuff in it. I had to add like a bunch of chalula sauce in there to compensate. I am not going to get this again, but I wanna go back to eat the vegan burger, I read that it is bland as well in other reviews, but I will havta try it. oh i am not even gonna try and think what my friends got, ofc all of it had pigs in it, but they did look happy about the food; is what I can muster right now.   Something about this place makes me wanna go again n again. In line with that I wanna go to their HH, or should we say Reverse HH , 10PM onwards everyday. and their desserts will be eaten as well, i hear they are good. Please watch this space for an update then. Until then P & P.",

Don't go here expecting to get a bbq pork sandwich and a beer for less than $20. Go somewhere else!  That said, after staring at the menu somewhat undecidedly for quite a while, I landed on a sliced roast beef sandwich (the closest I could get to what I really wanted), the dump truck salad and their tot of the day, and thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The food, while somewhat intimidating, is really genuinely good here. Our server was back to check on us pretty frequently and was even nice enough to shut off the misters when we thought it was too nice outside to have them on. Their patio is dog friendly, which I love, and I also enjoyed that it was off the beaten path of Old Town. It's nearby, but definitely sets itself apart from the rest of the restaurants in the area. Definitely a place to try, especially if you're one with an advance palate!",

    "text": "This is my first \"updated\" review. I hate to say it, but P&P has been on a steady decline and my previous 5 stars must be amended. Sadly this decline has gimped both the service and the food. It started when I was with my best friend and we received, how should I put it... adversarial service from our waiter. I mispronounced the beer company \"deschuttes\"  and was callously mocked. Things went downhill from there. The level of arrogance and disrespect we received from him was way out of line but the food was spot on. Based on the waiter I put P&P on probation for a while.  I returned for some takeout and placed my order at the bar. I recognized one of tha managers and explained to him that my absence was caused by that atrocious waiter. The manager was happy to inform me that he was fired and that he had a bad feeling about hiring him. This time the takeout fell way flat. The pork tostada, which is one of their strongest apps was about 20% pork fat. It was nearly inedible and I had to pick out the pieces before digging in. The flavors were there, but this was a pretty obvious execution error.  The last straw was when I bought my parents in for dinner. Service was aloof, I had to get up and fill my own water due to an absence of attention. The Korean Beef lettuce wraps suffered a myriad of issues. Primairly the steak was served at room temp, combined with being undercooked and disgustingly fatty, this was a complete flop and a textural nightmare. The waiter spotted me filling my parents water glasses themselves and apologized for his lack of attention. I took the opportunity to call him out for poor ap, and he took it off my bill. After the water incident he paid us more attention and P&P crushed the main courses.  I wonder if P&P has had major staff shakeups, because my first handful of visits were flawless (see my original review). The talent in the kitchen and wait staff has had such a blatant fall from grace I can't see myself returining. Ever. A creative concept and menu brought down by poor service and execution. I'm sad but I'm sure I will find a new gastropub.",

Been coming here for a couple of years now, the food is all about the contrast, a unique culinary experience. Hence the Pig & Pickle. All the ingredients are top quality and uniquely sourced.   They try hard behind the bar, perhaps too much, time has not changed my opinion. The energy in the bar drops my review by 1/2 star as I always eat my meals in the bar area. Can't put my finger on what puts me off, all I know is I tend to leave directly after I eat.

But forget that noise, because once you are inside you forget where you are.   First and foremost- beverages as in cock motherfucking tails are top notch. Every drink they mix is done to perfection, I hate these other god damn restaurants where everything is too sweet or they put 18 different mixers in each drink. I want to taste my booze and Pig serves it up just right.  They use high quality alcohol paired with outstanding bitters and tinctures. They even have a few cocktails they age themselves.  Not only are the drinks awesome but beer and liquor selection is killer.   On to the food, obviously this place serves some bomb ass meats from pork belly to foie gras smear to carnitas tostadas. I have ordered several items and have never been let down unlike my sex partners. The Elvis dessert is downright tasty.   Lastly, the service is always exceptional, granted I only sit at the bar or do take out but they are always friendly and go out of their way to make sure you have a great experience.

We arrived as they opened for dinner. Immediately we were greeted warmly. The waiter was awesome, gave good advice and was very attentive without being overbearing. The kids fish and chips were awesome! I had the ratatouille which was awesome!  One of the best meals I've ever eaten. They bake their own bread which was some of the best! The price was a bit more than i was expecting, but in the end it was worth it. The food was excellent the staff was awesome!",

I ended up ordering the pork shoulder tostadas, per the recommendation of you fellow Yelpers, and was not disappointed. They were SO good. I'm not sure if I had eaten kimchi prior to these tostadas but I liked everything that was happening in my mouth.   I like that P&P offers industry discounts and good late night eats. I will definitely be back.",

We waited around to order, then finally had a server take an order right before Happy Hour ended to get it in before the deadline. Thoughtful, I suppose, but he wouldn't have had to rush had he stopped by the rest of the time we were waiting.  Went with lighter fare, but saw and sampled a few of other dishes around the table. Nothing was bad, but also nothing blew me away. Solid middle of the road across the board. All considered it is a place I wouldn't mind going back to if a friend picked it out, but doubt I'll be back on my own.",

We ordered the Ratatouille with pulled pork, Nancy sandwich, and shrimp and grits. Super good food and I love how you can see the kitchen cooking all of the food! However the desserts were the main star for us - blackberry vinegar pie and a glazed carrot cake did us in. We still can't stop talking about them (go out for dinner someone else, get dessert, \"but what about that vinegar pie and carrot cake\"...happens every time) :) Christina was a great server. Thank you P&P! Definitely want to come back here for late night!",

The desert, a deconstructed version of Elvis presleys Peanut butter and bananas, was good.   The only downside of the night was the pork belly, it was far too dry. In their defense after we informed the waitress they did provide another pork belly free. And while it was better, it still was not as good as some of their competitor offerings (aka melt in your mouth).  All in all it was a good meal. I would certainly order the Pork Buffalo shanks again, they were really good. And kudos to management for trying to make good on the pork belly, they didn't have to do that.",

I had ordered the clams and mussel entree and added a side of pork belly. Plating was 5/5, service was 4.5/5, cleanliness was 5/5, quality 5/5.  I have nothing to complain about, Nate our server was really nice and he gave us great reccomendations. He also gave us a free pie for my sisters 19th birthday. We also tried the lavender creme brulee which it wasn't too sweet so it was just right.    Not sure if it's a restaurant I would drive out of my way for but its a good place if I was in the area.",

    "text": "One of my most notable New Year's resolutions is to become a local at Pig & Pickle. Given the unassuming location at Hayden & Thomas, you wouldn't expect much from a restaurant in those parts. Yet it's a hop, skip and a jump from our house and it doesn't involve going into Old Town. I couldn't be more delighted with how much this place actually rocks as a humble yet trendy gastropub with fantastic eats and tasty booze. There is more resemblance to a neighborhood, pacific northwest eatery here than your typical Scottsdale overpriced, politely mediocre restaurant - which is precisely the appeal. As such, I will be returning on my cruiser for happy hour as often as I can.  As a pescatarian, I wouldn't have though there would be many options on the menu at a pork joint, but alas P&P delivers! With plenty of satisfying veg and seafood choices, I have yet to meet something here that isn't delicious. On a dreary winter night, the squash soup and tots were just the ticket to warming up my frozen bones. The brussel sprouts are also to die for and could convert any cruciferous hater out there with that runny yolk pouring all over the golden and crispy deliciousness. I can't wait to try the shrimp and grits next time. It seems there is quite a rotation to the menu as well, which always keeps things interesting.  The cocktail and beer menus are just as impressive and satisfying as the food. While the Amish Mule was just a tad sweet for my liking, it was a refreshing pick. The Vesper knocked me on my bum for a while, so needless to say it was damn good. The bartenders are super friendly and laid back - I'll be hard pressed to sit at an actual table any time in the future. Plus, if I am to obtain my goal of becoming a local, a seat at the bar is essential. Looking forward to my next visit!",

It is also a requirement to try one of their drink creations when we are in! The only reason I'm giving P&P 4 stars is that for some reason the service is often lacking. I have learned to drink my water slowly because most of the servers we have had will not refill it! Regardless, we always come back to try out their new delicious menu items.  Update: The husband and I have come back a few more times with friends. Food still innovative and delicious. Service has definitely stepped it up.

I've had many of their fish specials, and it's always a winner.  Happy hour wines on tap.  Yes, you read that right.  They have solid wine selections to compliment the savories - and you can read about the happy hour (and late-night) savories in the other reviews.    Pig & Pickle has a nice comfy vibe, eclectic clientele (from Scottsdale usuals to hipsters to service industry types).  Comfortable, homey fine dining.  Boy I hate the word \"gastropub.\"  It's really an edgy bistro trying to slum it a bit.  But in a good way.  Comfortable enough to hang but just industrial enough to rotate the 8-tops.    And--get this--I don't like dessert.  BUT:  The carrot cake is just heavenly.  Really.  Just say yes.  I get it every time.  Unless I'm saving room for yet another smoked salmon app or charcouterie plate.  MMMM.  *checks web for flight times to the Valley....",

Since, we've been here a few times, I already knew I was having the pork tostadas, even though I've been wanting to try the bone marrow, I just couldn't shy away from what I know is a hit. I also had the chowda with a side of pork belly, wow! Hit the spot. The hubby enjoyed his HUGE Cuban sandwich with the dump truck salad. The delicious mustard sauce with the sweet pickles really stood out with the meat and cheeses. Mm.   Now for dessert, we saw a lot of people ordering the s'mores pie, but we've talked to the man who makes the bread pudding creations and you got to try the new flavor he puts out each time. This was a cinnamon raisin with caramel sauce and homemade ice cream, and that bowl was empty quick.   Everything was on point except getting our check but I'm in the industry and our waiter was busy, and I'm not deducting for someone who is hustling to take care of his guest. Keep up the good work P&P, it looks like you will be around for the long haul, and that makes my belly happy.",

There was a deconstructed bicycle hanging on the wall. Loud posters and art covered most surfaces. Pig & Pickle socks were for sale from the host. Some spring training hopefuls lounged in a corner, watching TV while enjoying a beer. That is to say, a group of very fit, similar height men that came off as aspiring professional athletes (aren't we all this way when we watch sports?) hung out at the corner tables.   The food, though, didn't reach the same level. The Brussels sprouts, though covered in tender egg yolk, was missing, at the very least, enough salt. The vegetarian pie, artfully inside a cut of squash, made my stomach ache. I don't have food allergies, so I wonder what went wrong inside my stomach. It was enjoyable to scrape the squash off and eat it with the pie's ingredients. I don't think America is in any rush to replace pie crust with squash, but I enjoyed what Pig & Pickle did.   I had tried to come once before, but that day there had been a gas leak and Pig & Pickle closed for the night. I'd come back with friends. Though there weren't many vegetarian options on the menu, I'd still visit again.",

The staff wore shirts with the phrase \"Chicks dig the belly.\" Pretty funny! Friendly staff. TVs near to watch sports.    Then comes the food. :)  Starters: pork belly, chick pea pancake, Harissa, blue cheese n fig.  -This was a great combination put together. The pork belly was good but I've had ones that was more prepared to melt in the mouth.   Soup & Salad: golden beets, watercress, frisee, blue cheese crema, candied pecans, pomegranate, grape molasses with a side of pork belly. - Yummy in my tummy! This gives a balance of light but filling plate.   The Big Show: grilled hangar steak with fingerling potatoes, spinach, pickled beech mushrooms, chimichurri sauce  - Made medium well. Slight red. A little tough but probably don't wanna send it back just in case - ya know?   Sammies: smoked pot roast, caramelized onions, havarti, horseradish cream on white  hoagie bread with side of dump truck fries - Pot roast tasted like any other pot roast. Some pieces were moist. Others were dry. Caramelized onions are always a must. The fries were like any other fries too. Overall content. :)   Sweets: chocolate pecan pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream - This is new for me and a win. Delighted with \"new.\"   On the way out I just noticed a cute little piggy bank sitting on an entrance barrel. (Don't know how I missed that. Oh yeah- the gigantic P&P pig on the wall!!). Almost wanted to take it but of course I won't!   A place to enjoy pork belly!! ;)",

    "text": "3.5 stars for the food, round up to 4 for the service. For a restaurant called Pig and Pickle, you would expect their pickles and pork dishes to be amazing. However, we were slightly disappointed with some of the dishes we encountered.   For appetizers, we started out with the bone marrow, the Shishito peppers, watermelon blue crab salad, and pickles. The Shishito peppers were full of flavor and pretty good, I don't eat peppers often so it was a nice change. The sauce was a little on the salty side though. The watermelon blue crab salad was more interesting than good. A really unique mix of flavors, but it was okay. The bone marrow was our favorite of the appetizers, the marrow was very meaty and flavorful, but the salsa didn't exactly match with the marrow. Last but not least, the pickles. There were pickles green beans, egg, grapes, mushroom, okra, and pickles. The grapes were surprisingly really good pickled, it was a nice combination of sweet and sour. It was cool getting to try all of the different types!   For entrees, we shared the duck, pork shank, and the mussels. The pork was really basic. Buffalo sauce, blue cheese. It wasn't that good. Really disappointed in this dish. The mussels were fresh, but the chorizo was thinly cut and super chewy. It was not bad. However, it was the duck that saved the day. The duck was cooked a perfect medium rare and it was so tender and juicy! Paired with the pears and nuts, this dish was absolutely delightful!!   The total came out to be around $120 for four people as we also got a few drinks. Pretty cool how they age their own whiskey here; I would recommend ordering their drinks! They have two partners who opened this restaurant- one specialized in food and the other in bar tending which is super cool. The service was fantastic, and we had a good time!",

It's a good effort but falls flat on execution.  First off our food took 30 minutes to arrive, not good for a lunch menu and especially for not being fully booked.  2nd the food was disappointingly salty.  Way too overtly salty, I had to drink several glasses of water to finish my burger and couldn't finish my soup (they took the soup off the order which was good)  3rd - our waitress gave us the incorrect price for a chicken addition (said 4 when it was actually 6).   The place would have been good if the food was a lot less salty, and they had more than two people on staff to serve the food.    Like I said, poor execution.",

My husband says,  \"I'm going to go get some food\"  I told him that I wasn't hungry and to not get anything for me and I might just take a few bites of whatever he gets. Well, he knows me better than that, and brought home four boxes of food.   We got the tot of the day which was a very good start to the meal followed by 1 order of the tongue pastrami sandwich and one order of the pork burger. The burger is called apocalypse sow. Hehe.   I'm not really a fan of tongue so pastrami sandwich, while very good isn't something that I would order myself. The burger, however, was freaking fantastic! I have to say, I've never had a more balanced or better burger. It wasn't even beef! How can I dare say this? It was just that damn good. Soft bread, delicious caramelized onions, homemade bacon, that itself was to die for, and a deliciously seasoned patty. The best.  I would actually consider coming back to Scottsdale just eat this burger.",

We came in right before it got busy and we had no idea that happy hour was just beginning. Happy hour is from 4-6pm daily and I believe the restaurant is closed Mondays. We ordered a few $5 appetizers; pork belly tacos, a cheese platter, and a ham pulled pork baguette sandwich. The food was amazing! I almost drooled on myself eating one of those tacos. Eating here taught me how badly I had previously been neglecting my taste buds. We also tried two of their beers which were tasty but I don't recall which kind. Our server was friendly, quick, and helpful. The menu changes everyday I believe.  I love this and can't wait to return to try more dishes.",

The croque madame is one of the best I've had due to fine selection of ham and gruyere cheese melted perfectly. For meat lovers, the braised pork leg fell off the bone, a rather large bone. Last, if you love seafood, please, please try the mussels with Spanish style chorizo.  I can't gush more without drooling.  Keep up the good work guys!",

    "text": "So, Pig & Pickle is pretty good. Stopped in for dinner one night with friends. We got there between 7 and 8 on a Saturday night. We were able to get a table for 4 without a wait. The air in the restaurant was a bit stuffy and warm, but it was nicely decorated.  I asked for a diet Coke but was told they only have Coke Light, which is a lower calorie version of Coke. There's 111 calories in the bottle. The server told me they don't have diet Coke because they try to have more healthy menu items. Fair enough - aspartame isn't great, but some of the menu items are so decadent and heavy with butter, etc. that I found his comment about the diet Coke a little amusing.  I had the shrimp and grits. It was good, but I didn't think the seasoning was anything extraordinary. I also thought the portion was a bit small given the price. My husband had the Monte Cristo, which he thought was pretty good; it didn't wow him, and it was extremely heavy. My friends had the pot roast sandwich, which was good, and the duck, which they said was amazing. The accompanying salad for the sandwich had a dressing which was kind of oily and lacking flavor.  Service was good; our drinks were never empty and our waiter was able to make some good recommendations on the menu. I think some of the entrees were OK, and one was wow. The prices were a little high for some dishes, and reasonable for others. Overall, I think 3 stars is appropriate. I guess I just don't get the hype, but I wouldn't mind stopping in again. The fact that the menu rotates on a frequent basis is enough to make me come in for a different meal and give it another try, because I think the restaurant is promising.",

Secondly, each time I have been here the food has been delicious, and that's a huge understatement. The food is very unique and the flavored are amazing and mesh well. They have these items called Tots which are filled with something new daily, one time it was this pineapple mixed with something exquisite served with a dipping sauce (this time was nacho cheese dipping sauce.)  Side note, try the seared carrot cake with bacon on top, only if you want the best thing you have ever indulged on in your life. The food alone deserves five stars but I will not end there.   Lastly, the service is beyond five star. Every time, no exaggeration, every time I have been here the service is amazing. Unbelievably helpful staff, very accommodating and knowledgeable about their food. I brought my dog on the most recent visit (Great Dane/Lab mix) which is a large dog, and the staff was very welcoming of him. From feeding him homemade dog treats to moving heaters around to ensure our comfortability.  All in all one of my favorite places to visit in Scottsdale.  I just stumbled upon this amazing place one night and now I frequently cost because it's as close to perfect as perfect can get.",

    "text": "A fairly eclectic menu featuring items such as pork liver, braised pork shank, and pork belly, Pig and Pickle is a porcine charm.  If you like whiskey, Pig features a selection of over fifty (rough guess) types of spirits including unique ryes that'll produce a Manhattan cocktail reminiscent of a Wall Street watering hole.   The patio is noisy due to its open access to Thomas Road. On this night, everyone seated on the patio nearly jumped out of their chairs at the sound of skidding tires thinking an accident was in progress.  Shortly after, a loud boom from across the street, likely a car backfire, but nerve shattering nonetheless. Throughout dinner, the evening was littered with annoying roadway distractions, not fun.  My advice? Don't opt for the patio no matter how loud the climate inside.   Service was stellar, with the waiter offering helpful tips, advice on how things are prepared and how many servings to expect from various appys. Prompt, courteous, and seemingly well trained.   I had a pork shank accompanied by yams. The yams were a bit spicy but not too, just enough to add a spectacular flavor and wake up your taste buds. Unexpected and flavorful surprise for the non-yam enthusiast.   Pig and Pickle has done a good job with everything we experienced save for some type of barrier between the patio and the roadway to help with noise abatement.",

    "text": "Holy pork. I'm laying here on the couch writing this review on my phone because I'm too full to move.   We are staying at a nearby hotel and wanted something good but take-out friendly. Looking at their menu and yelp reviews, I was reminded of the Salty Sow in Austin, one of our favorite places.   I ordered a couple of tots, the Apocalypse Sow burger, beef tongue Reuben. and seared carrot cake.   Tots and Reuben were excellent but the burger and carrot cake really stole the show because they were a notably different and superior version of something I've eaten a thousand times.    The ground pork of the Apocalypse Sow had a soft texture with a lot of flavor, and the bacon and caramelized onions worked well together.  Each ingredient was well executed, and even the accompanying pickle was delicious.  This carrot cake was actually pretty dark and thick, like a brownie consistency and not just your run-of-the-mill carrot cake slapped on a flat top.  I was hesitant to order it because of the whipped goat cheese (I usually don't like it), but the friendly and knowledgeable bartender talked me into it and I'm very glad I got it.  My favorite part of carrot cake is a real cream cheese frosting, and this did not disappoint in terms of creaminess or flavor. The candied carrots added a nice crunch factor.  We're already considering stopping by on the way to the airport tomorrow, if I'm able to eat again by then.",

There was quite the age range of customers which must be a testament to the quality of food.  I also must be in the upper range since I did notice it was extremely loud.  Definitely not a place for a quiet, romantic dinner.  But a great place for a great cocktail and equally great meal.  I had to forgo the cocktail instead having a boring sparkling water with lime.  But I was pleased to see mussels on the menu which is one of my favorite lighter meals.  It was a decent sized portion for a modest price of $15.  Served in a rich and flavorful broth of white wine, tomatoes, and creme fraiche with plenty left for soaking into your bread (I ordered extra bread).  I did get a grain of sand in a couple of them, but overall it was a nice dish.  My husband had the bone-in pork chop cooked perfectly with the slightest hint of pink still there.  He also gave a thumbs up to the accompanying succotash.  As for the oven roasted bone marrow he ordered, I did not go there.  It was a significantly smaller portion than served at Searsucker, but was also priced quite a bit lower at $9.  He did like it, however.  I should also note, service was excellent!

After looking at their menu then thinking about the location of this place I was unsure what to expect.  You normally don't see this type fancy foodie cuisine in South Scottsdale and I was pleasantly surprised.  Almost everything I tried was very good.  The service was equally as good as our server was fast and friendly.  The prices, on the other hand, were a bit high I thought.  * Bread plate to start = very good.  The pretzel bread was awesome but so were the other few types of bread on there.  But WHY do they feel the need to charge $3 for it?  Having to pay for bread really pisses me off.  That is like paying to refill a soda. * Pork shoulder tostadas = very good * Iceberg wedge = very interesting and very good * Braised duck = tender, juicy, and very delicious. * Pretzel crusted red bird chicken = this was just ok.  It wasn't very flavorful and you really couldn't tell it was crusted with their homemade pretzel bread. * Stoney bah-loanie = very interesting but just ok - a bit too bitter for me * Moscow mule = pretty good but their homemade ginger beer made this one need to be sweeter  All-n-all this is a pretty decent place with great food.  The scene is a bit too foodie-hipsterish for me with all the farm-to-table bs, not having fountain drinks, charging for bread, etc.  However, I give this place a lot of credit for trying something new in an area that has seen nothing like it before.",

I was so irritated by their lack of service that I asked for a shot of tequilla and was welcomed with 'Last I checked this wasn't a 'Mexican' place so no, no we don't have tequila\" ... My response was 'well you have a Margharita on your menu so it shouldn't be THAT far fethched that I request tequila\" .. I didn't touch my SNOT of a dish and neither did the rest of my party due to the lack of quality and they never for a second thought to fix the issue. I personally have NEVER tipped based off of service and have always tipped 25% of the total bill due to my own beliefs and I am sad to admit that I absolutely refused to give more then the $50 my breakfast costed (that was never eaten) for that horrible service. The Mgr was arrogant and the one who made the \"Mexico\" comment. Im thoroughly saddened by this experience!",

I asked for a drink menu and a regular menu and he gave me the drink menu and he came back to the other end of the table a couple times leaving me still drink-less. After that he didn't ask about food and one of the guys in my party went up to him to tell him I was still looking to order. Everyone else received their food before I even ordered. I should have just given up right there, but I was starving. I ordered the apocalypse sow with salad. Not as good as I expected. I felt it was dry and lacking flavor. The aoli was just plopped in the middle. The meat was crumbling and I had to just eat it with a knife and fork. Should have just got the soup.",

    "text": "We came here around 10.30pm on a Sunday night after a 7 hour hike in the Grand Canyon.  We read good reviews about it and to be honest it was one of the few, if not the only pretty good reviewed place open at that time of the night. The plaza itself was empty and when we arrived the restaurant/bar only had a few people in it.  We liked the whole pig theme, it was well put together.  We were welcome promptly and advised we could sit wherever we wanted.  Unfortunately we just missed the regular menu cut off, as after 10pm they serve a much smaller late night menu, which we were a little disappointed about.  We ended up ordering the bone marrow, fries, lettuce wraps with kalbi beef, pork burger and sweet and chilli chicken wings.  Although we noticed only 1 person in the open kitchen, the food came out quickly.  The bone marrow was ok, normally I love it, but this was a little too oily for my liking.  The chicken wings were good, hubby finished them all. The burger patty was a little dry.  The lettuce wraps were pretty good.  The fries were good too.  It was pretty much just pub grub, nothing out of the ordinary although they make a mean Old Fashion! Overall we weren't particularly satisfied, it was ok, given we had such as a full on tiring day we thought everything would taste good but we were a little disappointed.   Unlikely we would go back but if we did we'd hope to try the food from the main menu.  The service was great, we can't complain about that.",

We were left hungry & had to get food on the way home. It's a good place for people on a diet. Lol. The drinks were not good either. Had a Cocktail that said it was with Ginger Tequila & Ginger Honey. There was nothing that tasted Ginger in there, other than the candied slice of ginger garnish. The drinks were in very small glasses. Not seen those glasses any other place. For $9.50, not worth it. Ordered the Marrow bone. There was no marrow. Just the bone. A huge bone, with nothing inside. What a waste of money that was. Had the pear salad, which was a very small plate, but it tasted good. My Husband had the Mussels in Thai Curry sauce. It was just a bowl full of Coconut milk. No flavor, just watery Coconut milk & the Mussels floating in it. My Husband had to order another meal, as he was still Hungry. I have never been to any restaurant in the US that we have not had food leftover. Here we had nothing leftover. We were in need of more food. And this is after we had a Breakfast & Easter lunch at home. And we are generally not big eaters. So you can imagine the size of the portions. Very Disappointed. Certainly won't be going here again. We live about 30 mins away, but still thought it will be worth the drive. Certainly not. I read the reviews on here & decided to try it out, but I am sorry I have to differ. It's nothing like what people have said on here. We spent almost $100 for 3 people & came home Hungry. Don't waste your time going here. There are better places around, cheaper & bigger portions.",

She said she obsesses over it and has been there several times for it.  I enjoyed the crisp pork belly and those insane fries.  I also shared the bread and cheese platter and it was very good - excellent bread!  The cocktails were fantastic!  I tried the Brussels but decided that I am not a fan of cheese with Brussels...theirs have Asiago on them.

We were a relatively large group to celebrate a work milestone and essentially were the only people at the restaurant starting at 7 pm. The service was s-l-o-w, ridiculously slow. I would have blamed that they were under-stuffed but again, there was literally no one else there apart from our group of no more than 14 people. Took a while to get our drinks - nothing special or fancy, just bottles of wine. About half an hour to get our food orders (after we repeatedly waved from our table trying to get somebody's attention). Another hour for our food to finally arrive to the table. Food was just okay (you would expect more after such a long wait, some kind of food masterpiece, at least in presentation!): the po'boy sandwich was on a regular baguette not the special baguette for po'boy; the flavors in the sandwich were lacking and there were only four (!!!) small shrimps, but the fries were actually good. They also announced that they ran out of burger buns as a couple of people from our group wanted a burger. The burger was served on burnt bread... I wanted to like it but not coming back.",

Luckily we came around 5:30 and took advantage of the Happy Hour deals. Literally every drink on the happy hour menu was excellent! My favorite was the Pain Killer. They also had killer deals on food on happy hour as well.   We had a large party so I was able to try a bunch of different dishes. The biggest standouts would be the Crispy Duck, Brussels, Steak, and the pickles!! Everything was cooked to perfection and flavor profiles were well balanced. They also can add bacon/pork belly to literally anything. Make sure to ask for pickles regardless of what you order!  Service was solid as well, it was my friend's birthday and our server solo sang him Happy Birthday like a champ.",

Initially only brought 2 glasses of water, had to ask for the 3rd.  However, on the positive we got 4 menus.  Seemed very upset that we wanted drinks too...  brought our food, well 1 plate.  Took 5 minutes to get the rest.  Just not sure why he works in this profession.  Crappy.  There will be no tip.  Not a penny",

    "text": "Dined here Friday night with my girlfriend, as it was her recommendation and one of her favorite places to dine in the valley. The place was packed as it was about 8:30 and there was a private party on the patio, but we managed to squeeze into the two seats at the end of the bar. We were greeted by the bartender whom my lady knew by name and given menus immediately and had our drink orders taken right away. Good local draft beers were a perfect compliment for the food we ordered, although it took a moment for the busy bartenders to get our food order. Understandable. We had the Brussels sprouts, the bone marrow, and the pork belly. They were all fresh and flavorful and flew out of the kitchen. We were a little underwhelmed by the bone marrow, which was served with pesto and roasted garlic puree and a couple crostini of toasted baguette. Really garlic heavy, but still rich and delicious. We took the strawberry vinegar pie to go, which makes this review 5 stars. It was so fantastic. Strawberry custard pie served with the sauces on the side for travel. Absolutely fantastic. Overall, it was a good meal and I would definitely go back and explore more of the menu and would recommend to anyone who asked.",

The server wrote down the wrong meal for my friend and then tried to tell us that's what she ordered which was unTrue. The staff, however, was apologetic and brought her actual order very fast, let us keep the meal we didn't order, and gave a discount so that was really nice. Our water was empty most of the time which was frustrating as I watched the server mingling with another table and then he just disappeared. We were ready to leave and after about 10 minutes of looking for the server I finally ask someone else for the check. Another 5 minutes and he shows up and asks if we're doing okay. I again ask for the check. It was good to try it, but I wouldn't go back.",

Your bartender gave me a half hearted \"sorry\" on the way out, so I'm good.  The first time we came here, we had a good experience. The second time, not so much. They switched to the late night menu early, so we had limited choices on food. Had the pork belly tostadas, which were previously good. Tonight, they were seriously gross and heavy on the mayo. Could only eat a few bites before feeling sick. Drinks were terrible too. Will not be returning.",

The dump truck salad was super simple - greens, sliced cauliflower, sliced carrots, baby tomatoes, radishes with a light, fresh dressing that added to the effect.  It was so fresh, it tasted like we were eating on a farm!  Perfect to split.   The Friday fish fry (available all week) - their version of fish and chips - was some of the best I've ever had.  The descriptions of panko breading and vinegar flavor on the fries drew us out of our usual no-fry ordering.  Wow, this did not disappoint - fish cooked to perfection, bursting with light, fried flavor and the fries were lovely, as well!  Hurry in because the menu changes frequently, and this dish is worth the trip.  Ooh, and the service was impeccable, as usual!",

    "text": "Last week I had a group of 10 people from work.  We were all out-of-towners-- And it became my duty to find a place where we could have food and drink.  Thanks to Yelp, I found Pig and Pickle!  At 4:30pm I called for a reservation, and at 6:15pm we showed up and were seated immediately.    The staff was very friendly.  We had a patient waiter, who had a second waiter with him whenever serving us.  They were so good.    We got our drink orders in, and I forgot what everyone got.   They have an extensive drink menu, whether it's cocktails, beer, wine or anything else alcoholic.   I opted for beer, a Saison Dupont farmhouse summer ale.    I had a hard time choosing because their beer menu is so diverse and interesting.    With all the amazing choices, you should NOT order the usual commercial beer, eg Bud, Miller, etc.   I now can't remember all the food, but we ordered a lot.  We started with a few orders of Shisito peppers that were cooked in a soy sauce mix of some sort.  Some of these peppers were hit or miss in spiciness.   I love spicy, but hit a really strong one, and for about 15 minutes my tongue was about to fall off.   We also started with three orders of the kalbi lettuce wraps.   The kalbi was medium rare and cut thick -- Which made it a little chewy.    To round out the appetizers, we also had two orders of the Brussels sprouts.    If you love Brussel sprouts, you must get these!   I was annoyed that I had share with the group!     Everyone ordered all kinds of entrees. As for me, I opted for the steak, medium rare.   I absolutely loved it.  Simple as that.     I'll be returning to Scottsdale in a few weeks, and you can be certain I'll be here again!",

I ordered the Cuban Pickle Crisis sandwich, which had chopped pork and ham, tasted really great. I also had the tatie tots, which were more like hush puppies than the tots we all grew up with.

Mainly because I really want them to succeed, since they are just around the corner from our house.  Here are the 3 main reasons they have lost my love.    1. The removed my favorite dish and the only vegetarian starter on the menu  2. Their website and twitter handle both say Happy Hour until 7PM, but they decided to change it to 6 and will not honor what they've advertised. 3. Their pickles are disgusting   We still received great service, and my vegetarian Chile/Mash was pretty tasty, but I hate going to a restaurant where I don't have choices or the opportunity to experience a complete meal (Starter, Main Course, and dessert). The server mentioned that their menu keeps changing and it's hard for her to keep up, let alone the website... this is going to cause them major problems if they don't get their act together.  I was disspointed and live a mile away, imagine how upset someone will be who traveled a great distance based on the information they had listed on their website! Again, I hope they do well, but I won't be rushing back any time soon....",

    "text": "When I first came to Pig & Pickle, I didn't know what to think of the menu. Now that I've been here a few times, I can definitely appreciate the approach that P&P takes to their food. I love the fact that it is always changing, and that it's fresh and different from most places in town.  From what I've had here, I definitely recommend the pork shoulder tostadas and charcuterie to start out. If you're feeling adventurous, get the \"pickled things\".  For entrees, the burger is always a safe choice but the mussels in white wine with chorizo really steals the show - my girlfriend has literally been quoted as saying, \"I can't believe I'm eating mussels on Thomas and Hayden and actually loving it.\" Last night I had the pretzel crusted chicken breast with ratatouille - lawdy lawd it was good.   What I will say is you absolutely CANNOT come here without ordering their \"tots\" on the side. These things are special, friggin' delicious, and always changing with their ingredients.  Lastly, they have an event space for groups in the back which is nice, they post local art on the walls that you can buy which is cool, and they have a good happy hour. You can have a lot of the appetizers for $5 (including the tostadas and charcuterie) as well as some wine and cocktails for five bucks. Boo-yah.  Yes, yes, and yes to Pig & Pickle.",

    "text": "I went to the Pig & Pickle for a dinner out with friends this past weekend.  We were a large group that was easily accommodated for by the staff.  There was plenty of seating in the restaurant, and a back area that made the large group setting more comfortable.    I shared several dishes with friends so I'll list them off with my opinion but as you can tell by my overall review I was very satisfied with my experience.  When my mid-western parents come to visit in a month I'm absolutely bringing them here for dinner.  The menu was fancy but the atmosphere was causal.   Important to know - the portion sizes are large, even on the starters.  I wasn't aware of this when I started ordering and as you can see from the list, I was very full after dinner even though I was sharing.  The same goes with the actual dinners and sandwiches, expect to take home leftovers if you aren't starving.  ...Smoked Salmon, tater tot, fennel, lemon crema - If you love smoked salmon, then this is the best thing to get.  It was light but savory.  The lemon crema really made it special.  I would absolutely get this again.    ...braised pork belly, yam puree, brussel sprouts slaw and blis maple - This is just fabulous if you want two slabs of pork fat.  I'm not complaining, because who doesn't love pork fat, but it was a bit heavy when paired with the other heavier dishes.  ...wood oven roasted bone marrow, crostini and onions - I think this was the smallest portion size of all the dishes but with the strongest flavor.  I've never had bone marrow before this dish so I can't say if it was good or not.  The presentation was great and I enjoyed the experience.  ...cool beets salad (name too long) - I love beets, and I loved this salad.  Without question I will order this again.  It was light and pleasant, a great start.  It isn't big enough for a solid meal, but great to split with someone and a small appetizer.  ...lamb dish that was a special from the chef - cooked very well, with a fishy taste.  Anchovies are part of the meal (in the sauce though, no actual visual fish) and they really over powered the dish.  I liked it but heavy, so when added with the bone marrow and the pork belly I was over run with heavy dishes.  ...Seared carrot cake - BEST CARROT CAKE EVER.  I don't typically like carrot cake.  I typically find it fine, good enough, nice with some cider and fall weather.  This though, was the best I've ever had.  The seared surface really make the texture fantastic.  It had a deep flavor and a nice light goat cheese frosting.  The serving size is large, share this with someone.  ...little elvis desert - I wasn't a huge fan of this one, I think the most disappointing thing I tried.  IT was a nice concept, the bacon was too disappointing though, realy should have been a thicker cut but looked more like a piece of bacon on a fast food burger.",

Last time we were there they were playing old school hip hop and rap, it was hilarious.  Our group usually goes on Sunday nights.  Some of our favorites are the tot of the day.  They do these huge tots usually filled with lots of cheese, meat, and accompanied by some kind of dipping sauce.  We got the duck fat fries, seared foie gras, and the wood oven roasted bone marrow with crostini and onions.  The fun thing is after you eat the marrow, the bartender will pour a shot down the bone!  My absolute favorite thing is the pork shoulder tostadas with ginger aioli, kimchi, and scallions.  It's the perfect Korean Mexican fusion, and the pork is so tender and juicy, and it's so messy to eat but so worth it.  Dessert!  We've gotten this deconstructed smore, this awesome meringue  thing, The Elvis, a deconstructed pb&j thing, and a friend got the carrot cake and they loved it so much.  I'm bad at remembering names, and the desserts change around a bit.  But they're all yummy.",

I ordered the smoked pot roast sandwich with havarti, caramelized onions and horseradish and my foodie-buddy ordered the pork burger with bacon, aged cheddar and grilled onions.  We would have discussed our food experience, but our mouths were full and it wouldn't be polite  :)   We shared a S'more for dessert which was described as chocolate mousse on a graham cracker crust with toasted marshmallows. We were just a tad disappointed that the mousse was hard as a rock, so when you tried to cut into it, it flew off the plate, making a bit of a mess.  As it sat, it softened some and was a much more pleasant treat, but had to ask for a doggy bag as it was VERY rich.  All in all, great food and good service. I would definitely return for another go.",

The \"vegetarian chili\" arrived in an enormous bowl (think mini crockpot) and consisted of a thick layer of cheddar cheese, mixture of mashed potatoes, scallions, and more cheese, with a light layer of pinto beans on the bottom. This combination was every bit as delicious as it sounds, but I was floored that anyone would attempt to pass this dish off as \"chili.\" Whatever the name of the dish, I was delighted with the 1/4 of it that I was able to finish!   We also ordered the Tots as an appetizer and they were absolutely delicious. Everyone in the group enjoyed their meals; there were nothing but positive remarks all around. As the name of the restaurant implies, this is the place to go if you're in the mood for comfort food. I think everyone we were there with would agree that this place counts as an indulgence.

I love when you can clearly see the respect the chef has for his ingredients. While the menu is very creative it is just simple food done really well.   During our visit we started with the chef's feature oysters and pork shoulder tostadas. I had always been anti-oyster but tried these and loved them! They were small and delicate with a meaty texture, and the citrus on top was a delicious compliment. The tostadas were a nice portion, tender pork with kimchi and a nice aioli. They were very tasty.   For our entrees I had the mussels with chorizo and the husband had the pork trio(Braised snout, pickled nose and cracklins.) The mussels were amazing, I loved the smokiness of the chorizo with the delicate broth,  a really superb dish. Mu husband really enjoyed his pig bits. Especially the flavor of the root vegetable puree.   It also worth noting they have great cocktails and a fantastic beer selection. On this visit we stuck with cocktails, a Moscow mule and Manhattan. Simple, unpretentious and great quality.   Pig and Pickle is an instant favorite and we will be making many visits.",

They have a fun obsession with sneaking pig into as many items as they can that fortunately doesn't carry over to the pickle side of things, which I'm thankful for.  I had their lovely pork belly appetizer and their amazing burger. Amazing because it was charred on the outside, in such a way that when it was first delivered, I was worried they had screwed the pooch on \"medium rare\". Except that as I cut into it, it broke into an example of the most radiant, beefy splendor, perfectly cooked, with no ketchup necessary. A perfect tomato, the right amount of lettuce, and some delicious cheese. This, my friends (and to paraphrase a scene in How I Met Your Mother) is a BURGER.  Their desserts were great as well, and everyone really loved their slightly different take on things and quirky menu options. We'll definitely be back.",

The name Pig & Pickle is so deceiving since if I heard the name without coming to the joint, I would expect a hole in the wall BBQ place.  But I see from the many reviews this place has already received, the word is out that this place is a foodie heaven and a cool place to hang out. I will be back again, this time before the 1am gong hour so that I can try out their menu along with more of their delicious, libacious cocktails!",

It is rare to meet such sincere people! The beany pie, and their tots are so good! I'd like to try their dessert soon, and their other vegetarian dishes. The food is reasonably priced, too! Obviously this is not a fast food joint, so it is going to be more expensive, because it is REAL food-(and fresh at that)! Your taste buds will definitely thank you for eating at Pig and Pickle!",

    "text": "Was excited to check this place out since it seemed rather unique for the area, but the run of the mill food could not save the poor service. This place definitely reminds me of a person who thinks that they are wayyyyy hotter than they really are.   Food was a 3, service and overall experience was a 1, so landed on a 2 rating. Would not recommend. Full review below -   Earlier in the week, my wife called to ask a question about our reservation. She was promptly told we didn't have one (we did) and was hung up on. Delightful. Should have been red flag #1.  When we walked in and the hostess seated our party (spoiler - the reservation we actually had), the atmosphere and I really enjoyed the modified wine bottles that were used as drinking glasses.  Drinks - Beer list was solid and definitely above average for the area. I settled on Dogfish's Festina Peche which seemed refreshing given the recent heat/humidity combo. Going rate for the beer was $7. When it came back from the bar, I noticed that I received it in a beer snifter glass which holds about 10oz. Looked around and noticed that other people in my party had the same pour. Now, I have no problem paying (and have more than I should) $7, $10, $12 for a 10oz pour of a higher alcohol by volume or rare seasonal beer. But $7 for a 10oz (really 8oz since mine was short poured and spilled on the table) fairly standard seasonal that has an ABV of 4.5%? The blatant money grab on the drinks is not a good look.  Food - As happy hour was ending, I decided to order the Chef's Charcuterie board. This was easily the best thing I had. Seemed like an assortment of pickled veggies and an egg with bread, jam and 3 kinds of meat. I can't tell you exactly what was on the board because the waiter just dropped it off in front of me with zero explanation and walked away. For the main course, there really wasn't anything innovative or unique on the menu, so I settled on the pot roast because I was craving it for some reason. Tots were easily the best thing on the plate. Pot roast was kinda bland, definitely needed salt. Aioli didn't really add much and didn't really make all that much sense from a flavor profile in my opinion.  A group of us (11) try a new place every month. This month happened to fall on a birthday. So, we brought some cupcakes as is the tradition. Waiter tells us that in order to serve them in the restaurant, we have to pay $4 a head. When we protest to the manager, he tells us it is a health code violation. So...it's a food safety risk unless we pay you $4 a head? Word of advice, the money grab is bad for business. 11 people who had been there for 2 hours now will not order another $7-12 drink ($77 is more than $44, shocking I know) and will leave with a bad feeling about your place. Not smart.  Overall, food is ok, service is bad, drink situation will make you feel like you need a shower. Spend your time and money somewhere else and thank me later. Perhaps over a normal sized beer?",

The croque madame with tater tots were amazing, although the tots were not a traditional deep fried potato tot, but more of a fried ball of mashed potatoes with hot dog somewhere in the mix. And, of course, being from California, we had to get TWO orders of foie gras (because it's illegal here), but so worth it. The bone marrow and lardo on toast were both very good, but what really stood out was the duck leg. My parents and I are hardcore foodies and it's hard to find duck that isn't dry and overcooked, but they did great!

When the BF and I got there, we realized it was happy hour and I could not resist 5$ plates. We asked the waitress what the best item on the happy hour menu was and she said the bahn mi.....I was skeptical because it had liver on it (eeeek), but decided to try it. It was actually fairly good! The pork was a little mushy and looked really gross, but the veggies added a good amount of flavor and crunch to the sandwich...I couldn't really taste the liver. After eating half this sandwich, there was no way I could get the burger....way too much food. So the BF and I decided to share a couple more happy hour items including the tacos and the beer cheese dip (much healthier and lighter, right? ha.) The taco was fairly disappointing because it had that same mushy pork on it with mushy refried beans and nothing crunchy to change the texture....just mush....not awesome. The beer cheese was ok, but again, had kind of a weird texture....it says it comes with things to dip in it which is 99% bread....not exactly what I expected. Overall, I just didn't think it was amazing, BUT I still want to give them another chance by trying a real meal here because I like that they use a lot of local ingredients and make a lot of their ingredients fresh (like bread and whatnot).",

The Hits: - Pork belly was really outstanding - cooked beautifully with a nice side of bok choy. - Brussel sprouts were also fantastic as an appetizer. - The duck we had was really well cooked and extremely flavorful.  The Misses: - The pork tostadas were INCREDIBLY salty. Couldn't taste anything but salted meat in there. - The marscapone risotto was pretty bad... very creamy, but woefully undercooked and almost flavorless. - The steaks were tough and really lacked flavor and seasoning. - The pork tenderloin was very, very pink in the middle and didn't have much flavor to it at all. - None of the desserts were particularly impressive - all seemed store-bought.  We probably wouldn't return on our next trip to Scottsdale.",

The duck fat fries are not to be missed either! They have an excellent alcohol selection. Talented bar staff too- they really know their trade. Friendly and fun wait staff. The live music is excellent, and it puts the finishing touch on the unique vibe. The ONLY way I think this place could get any better is perhaps expanding their menu a bit. But maybe that's just me. ;) Regardless, I consider it to be quite a treat every time I visit this place!!",

No bullshit, they are some of the best in the business.   Keenan and Josh run the kitchen. From the countless times I have dined here, I cannot find one complaint. It is a restaurant that makes it very difficult to try the same thing twice, as you want to try something different every time. My personal favorites have been the Apocalypse sow, smoked salmon app, and anything involving pork belly. They absolutely crush it. Fresh, local, and unique cuisine is offered on the daily.   Find out when they offer beer pairing dinners. They provide you with a chance to try some awesome food, paired with chronic brews. Seats run out quick, so jump on them when you can.   This is my favorite restaurant. Try it.",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Harry Chapin/Ugly Kid Joe - Cats In The Cradle) I arrived to this place just the other day I drove here in the usual way But there were plates to serve and bills to pay I came for happy hour and I ordered away And the server was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he spoke He'd say \"I'm gonna go grab your drinks man\" You know I'm gonna go grab drinks  And the pig & pickle in South Scottsdale Little Asian boy and the mood for some food Comfort style from the home that's rad! Restaurant Week, we'll get together then You know we'll have a good time then  Pig & Pickle offers comfort style food right in South Scottsdale.  A little off from the main strip of Oldtown, but that's all good.  I remember this place when it was the Detour Tavern which obviously didn't work out.  The layout is still the same.  Granite bar table on the South end with the patios outside.  Open kitchen on the Northwest side overviewing the dining room.  The place has a modern homey feel with some art decors I'm guessing from local artist.    I came here during Restaurant Week 2013.  I ordered the Bone Marrow, Ale Cheddar Bacon soup, and the Pork Porchetta, while my sister and her BF order Pork Shoulders, grilled Romaine Salad, and Braised Duck Leg.  Overall, it was a lot of food!  The Bone Marrow was yummy, gelatinous and goowy with pickled and caramelized onions over a crustini. Texture was perfect in my view, soft and goowy with the pungent onions and crusty bread.  My Cheddar Bacon soup, well it was cheddar bacon soup.  Didn't think much of it.  My sister's Pork Shoulder was served like mini sope tacos.  I thought it needed some heat.  My sister BF salad was oddly to say one of my favorites.  It had a nutty dried fruit taste with the crunch from the Romaine.  The egg was added the extra ooze of a texture and the Caesar cheese was mellowed by the sprinkled crushed croutons!  Finally, our main meal was okay at best.  Guess I'm not a big fan of Porchetta, but I thought it could have been roasted more on the outside to add some crispiness to what I would consider the bacon part.  The Fattiness of the pork was okay and the meat was nice and well cooked.  Not too dry, but I guess the fat help it stay moist.  I had to take some home since I was getting too full.  The horseradish mashed potatoes and the pickled cabbage atop I could have done without.  Then again maybe this comfort food is more made for an English man, not the Asian man haha!    In the end, the service is tops.  Very well done and they seem to be knowledgeable about their menu.  Drink fill ups were quick, which in my case is important since I can drink water like no other.  I really enjoyed my visit to the pig & pickle and I really want to continue to come and give this place a chance.  For now, I will have to say a 3 star. - Enjoy!",

We sat at the bar and Jen, our bartender, was amazing. She let me sample several of the happy hour draft beers before deciding on a pilsner while my husband chose a Mexican beer off of the canned beer list. We loved the variety of beer choices, you aren't going to find Bud Light here but you'll be happy with the alternatives!   We started with the beer cheese app served with a variety of fresh baked breads which was outstanding. The tot of the day was pancetta(?), cheese and jalapeno and my husband loved these. For my dinner I ordered the vegan burger with the dump truck salad and both were delicious. Vegan burgers are hard to do but P & P got this right! My husband had the pot roast sandwich with French fries which were fantastic & he raved about the sandwich.   We loved the atmosphere-open kitchen, lots of light shining in, pig figurines everywhere, if you get the chance, GO!",

    "text": "Pig and Pickle's website says it best!   \"...don't call us one dimensional....the idea behind the brand is all about balance. sweet needs sour...chocolate needs salt...we support local when possible, small farmers, happy animals, real sugar, real fat... we hand craft our cocktails, bake our bread daily, make our own aioli and grow our own herbs....\"  This is just the kind of place you want to venture to for great cocktails, great bites, or an indulgent dinner.  Happy hour here is a fantastic way to familiarize yourself with their toothsome menu.  Featured are $5 Pupus such as the incomparable  \"Dump Truck Salad with mixed lettuces (spring greens such as arugula and spinach), radish sprouts, fresh mint, baby shaved veggies like radish, cauliflower, cucumber, carrots, cherry tomato, sesame seeds, shaved fennel, chia, flax seed, and all doused with a wonderful cucumber and shallot vinaigrette, dusted with sea salt and cracked pepper.  Incredible!  You can also enjoy the likes of Creamy Broccoli and Brown Ale Soup, or a selection of the Chef's housemade charcuterie, all for $5 during HH which is 4-6p Daily.  The menu does change seasonally, so there are items such as the Crispy Chicken Tacos with Sriracha Aioli and slaw that may not always be on the menu.  With a name like \"Pig and Pickle, I was unsurprised to find the chicken tacos lackluster.  Chicken was breaded and consequently dry and flavorless.  It would have been a great taco if the meat was rotisserie or marinated.  The aioli was wonderful, just the right amount of kick balanced by the cool of the red cabbage.    However!  The Pork liver and Caramelized Onion Smear, with pickled fennel and an apple raisin mustardo was exquisite.  It had a wonderfully smoky flavor, and the Hawaiian sea salt gave it so much more character.  Highly recommended for pate lovers.  Personally, I thought this plate was great without the pickled fennel or the mustardo - just the amazing sea salt.  The Wood Oven Roasted Bone Marrow came last, served with Crostini  and caramelized onions.  It tasted like a decadent and savory sweetbread butter, and it is no wonder why it is a staple here at P&P.  Drinks! With names like Salty Dog and the Stoney Baloney, you are in for a unique treat.  The Stoney had a unique melange of Hophead vodka, fresh lime, grapefruit juice, hop grapefruit bitters, an IPA float, and candied lemon rind.  The Salty dog their own version of the \"Greyhound\" with Hawaiian sea salts.  Although I did not venture into sampling the Dinner menu, I spied several tasty looking dishes such as Pork Porchetta and Mussels in White Wine.  With great service and equally great dishes, I am definitely coming back here for more!",

The atmosphere was very casual and relaxed but it seemed like at the same time there was an attention to detail and the staff really cared about the food and took pride in their restaurant. Our waitress was very sweet. I ordered the beet salad but I wanted it without the bleu cheese crema and so she talked to the chef and had them make a different dressing for it so that it wouldn't be too boring and still have plenty of flavor. It ended up being a really delicious salad and the beets were fantastic! The hubby ordered a burger which he was equally pleased with. It looks like they have a good beer and wine selection at very reasonable prices so I am sure we will be back.",

Also had the pork sandwich with golf ball sized tater tots, filled with amazing flavors.  ( I am a loser and can't remember what  was actually in them, but they were amazing!) The food here is great . They don't have diet coke , but they carry regular coke products in a little glass bottle at $3 each. Bartender claims the owners do not  carry diet coke because it contains  fructose corn syrup.. Seriously! You FRY Brussels sprouts and smother them with BACON for crying out loud!!!  I (unfortunately)  NEED diet coke with savory food.  Sorta like wine and cheese for some. I tried an ice tea and it was so bland, tasted like water. So knowing I wasn't happy with my drink options, (diet coke or diet coke) the bartender (we sat at the bar) gave me room temperature tap water, containing a single ice cube which quickly melted.  Eww.   She could have at least dressed the water glass up with a pile of ice and a fruit wedge of some sort, after all, It was 111 de- freakin grees outside!!! She's amateur, it was obvious.  But the food was  delicious and so this place still gets five stars.  BUT, IF I ever decide to return,  I'd smuggle in my own diet cokes or else I couldn't eat here.  SAD! but it's the way it is.  Also, weird/small selection of beer my husband wasn't happy with, he asked for a chilled glass for his CAN of beer, and the \"bartender\" offered him a can cuzzy, cozy, whatever the hell you call it  instead. NOT OK!!! AND the pickles have a funky taste.  I better stop talking or I'll be changing my five star review. Oh! And they have weird hours.",

Only 1$) Give a beer board (you can buy a beer for a friend write their name on a board and when they come in its already paid for so they can enjoy)  Amazing staff (I have yet to have bad service) Phenomenal menu (thanks to amazing head chef)  great Bar!!! Clayton is an amazing owner and has an amazing sense of humor my boyfriend an him are always cracking jokes to each other!  Try \"the Nancy\" but add pork belly or bacon!  I'm also a huge fan of their \"cookie-ish desert! My goal is to try everything on the menu but if hard because there constantly changing the menu adding new items and mixing it up! Another highlight is their late night menu! Try the Udon Noodles soooo good!!   The braised duck leg is also a must try!   The only thing that I've had that I wouldn't be jumping at having again was the pork tostadas (not horrible just not my cup of tea)  I'm so happy that this spot is here!!

    "text": "I like the concept a lot.  However, the food is just not right, or \"balanced\" as they say they're striving for.  My friend got a burger.  It was plain, no seasoning on the meat.  The best part was the pickle which ironically was closer to a type of kimchi than the kimchi that was supposed to be on my dish but back to that later.  The \"tots\" that we paid an extra dollar for was nasty.  Weird potato based hushpuppy.  It wasn't very good, wish we just stuck with fries.    I got the pork shoulder tostadas.  It could be pretty good, but the pork was just salty.  Not a lot of other flavor, just salty.  The kimchi was an attempt at the cheap chinese restaurant variation using regular cabbage but the seasoning was all wrong.  Just because you put some shredded cabbage with salt and red pepper, it doesn't make it kimchi.  There's a LOT of other ingredients!  The dessert was definitely the best part of the dinner.  Seared carrot cake.  The best thing I've had in a while actually.    So all in all, I'll go for dessert.  And maybe beers.  Also, they take a long time to get food out so don't go if you're on a time crunch.  Fortunately I wasn't, but I can see how this can be an unexpected problem..",

    "text": "After hearing about the creative and delicious dishes at Pig & Pickle and learning about the Chefs' commitment to local produce, handcrafted cocktails, homegrown herbs, and fresh baked breads, I was excited to finally visit P&P to celebrate a friend's birthday.   Our server, Cat, was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She was encouraging of us trying new things without being \"pushy\" which was quite refreshing. We ordered a round of cocktails and everyone was quite pleased with the humorously named drinks: \"Red Headed Stepchild\" (which came with a Sour Patch Kid!), \"Salty Dog\" (vodka, black/white hawaiian sea salts, fresh grapefruit) and the \"Maggie\" (homemade triple-sec and Hawaiian Sun strawberry/passionfruit juice - delicious but not too sweet). I ordered the \"Bramble On\" (gin, blackberry, lime juice, soda) because it sounded creative and refreshing, but since I'm not a \"gin girl\" I didn't find it quite as tasty as the other drinks.   The favorite appetizers that the group tried were the Pork Belly Tostadas ($9 for two large tostadas) and the Fried Brussels Sprouts with Asiago and a Farm Fresh Egg ($7). The Butternut Squash Soup with toasted pepitas was so delicious that I was glad that I had a small bowl for myself that I didn't have to share!   A specialty item on the menu tonight was Trotter Stuffed with Fennel Sausage. \"Pied de Cochon,\" as this delicacy is known in France, is French for Pigs' Trotters or Pigs' Feet - yep, feet! Not surprisingly, this part is typically thrown away by butchers, but apparently this can be quite appetizing when it's prepared correctly (bones removed, cooked for hours, etc.). I don't love pork, so I passed on the opportunity to try this dish. The meat-lovers in the group tried the stuffed trotter and were disappointed that it wasn't quite as tender as expected, though they raved about the fennel sausage and the raspberry sauce that accompanied the dish. Our server noticed that most of the dish was left untouched and when she heard it wasn't quite as expected, she apologized and took it off our bill.   The main dishes were the the show stoppers of the night! The Golden Beet Salad ($9) was artfully presented and deliciously prepared with candied pecans, watercress, bleu cheese crema, and pomegranate seeds. The sandwiches or \"sammies\" come with your choice of fries, small \"dump truck\" salad, or tots for an extra $1. With all the other appetizers, two people split the \"Nancy\" (brie, avocado, tomato and shaved red onion on garlic rubbed bread) and were quite satisfied with the sammie and salad.   The birthday girl selected the \"Chocolate Mud Cake\" for dessert, which was beautifully presented with a candle and chocolate garnish on the side. The chocolate cake was moist, rich and delicious with a hint of sea salt that was nicely paired with a scoop of butter pecan ice cream.   After a fun birthday celebration that excited our taste buds, I'd love to come back to P&P to sample more of the menu and enjoy the happy hour pricing (4-6 pm daily).",

I've been a very frequent diner here over the past year and it just keeps getting better. Pig & Pickle is always looking to add new delicious eats to their incredible menu. I like to try as many things as possible on their menu but a few favorites I always go back to are their signature pork tostadas, fried brussels sprouts with asiago and a farm fresh egg (I recommend adding bacon), and for brunch, their p&p benedict.   Every time I go in I also always order a couple of their tots which contains different ingredients every day. My favorite dessert is their Strawberry Vinegar Pie which is not always on the menu so if it's there, you MUST order it. The name is deceiving but trust me and thank me later. All their other desserts are delish, you can never go wrong with the Elvis or the Mississippi Mud Pie.   I could go on and on but I don't want to give away all the secrets to this place I could call my second home. The bartenders have concocted a very fun palette pleaser of a cocktail menu in addition to all the great beers they feature from microbreweries. The staff have become great friends that I look forward to seeing every time I walk in.   If I could give this place 10 stars, I would.",

I know 330pm is t a normal mean time, but it tends to be for someone whose day is scheduled around client appointments.

We recommend sharing it with someone. My husband's favorite is the crispy skin trout, which comes with an incredible brown butter sauce and roast fingerling potatoes. The mussels were flavorful with a wonderfully spicy broth. You definitely need the grilled bread to stop up the sauce.   As for the appetizers... I can't say it enough... Pork shoulder tostadas.

We were sold but didn't actually make it to the restaurant until my husband's birthday in January.  We enjoyed every part of our meal. We had two tots of the day (Sriracha something?) - do not skip out on tots! We also had some sort of mini assortment of pickled items (so good, next time the larger assortment). The broccoli beer cheese soup was to die for (wished we hadn't shared). I had the veal that was a chefs feature that night and my hubby had the pork shank, both were executed perfectly.   My husband enjoyed their large assortment of craft beer and I loved the Funktional Drunk (one of their many craft cocktails).  The service and ambiance was on par with the rest of our experience and our chef friend from the beer fest sent the strawberry vinegar pie our way and it was the perfect finish to the meal.  We were so impressed we made Valentines reservations before leaving the restaurant.  Can't wait to try their brunch as well!",

    "text": "Checked out the P&P for restaurant week.  We arrived early and decided to test out the happy hour specials at the bar before having dinner.  There are lots of apps for about $5 to sample during happy hour.  I recommend the beer cheese.  It was really good.  The charcuterie board was pretty good as well though I didn't care for jam.  The HH drink specials were ok with drinks and beer in the $5 range.  Might as well stick with the liquor.    The main event came around and I couldn't do the 3 course restaurant week menu on the account of the appetizers at the bar.  I opted for the Apocalypse sow (pork burger with bacon).  I wasn't in love with it.  I'd recommend going for the regular burger with a big slice of pork belly added on.  It'd be a $1 cheaper and better.  The rest of the party ordered various things, including the restaurant week menu.  The marrow bones looked great, the crispy chicken received good reviews, and the $2.50 cans of Hamm's were certainly enjoyed.  For dessert, the Elvis was probably the one that went over the best.  All in all, the P&P has a great atmopshere, creative food, and good specials.  I'll definitely be back.",

When I visited it was for a friends birthday and so there was a fairly large group (8 people) and so you expect a slightly longer wait for food - which was fine.  The only disappointment was the quality of food as I'd be building it up in my head all day at work thinking about how amazing it was going to be, but it was just a bit average. Nothing was bad per say, but this is why it's a 3 star review not 4 stars.  Beer selection here is great though and the servers are fantastic - they'll talk you through which beers suit which dish or taste and advise you on what to try. I always like it when servers interact more personally and show a genuine passion for what they do!  A nice evening for a friends birthday and a good spot for a group. It just didn't set my world alight.",

The decor is so cute, there are many pigs and pickles hanging around the dining room and the kitchen is open to the dining area which I love. Since my first time I've been here more than I can count and each time I've had the best food and have been waited on by the most knowledgeable and friendly staff ever.   The food here changes with the seasons and they offer fresh and local dishes which is refreshing since I like to try new things. Honestly you could get anything on the menu and it will be the most delicious thing you've eaten.",

This could've been my whole meal it was that good.   My fiance had the shrimp tots, so tasty with the beef brisket. Amazeballs.  I had the hanger steak with a duck egg side......5 stars!!

They came back after taking our order to get my order again because they forgot.  I got the crab hash. They dropped something greenmixed with a fried egg on top. Before I dug into it, they took it away because they gave me someone else's plate. My plate came. It was also greenmixed with a fried egg on top so it made the mistake understandable but made me question in the variety of the food.  Anyways, I would not recommend the crab hash. It was surprisingly very creamy. It could be called \"cream of crab hash\". The flavors weren't there and of course, the texture was nonexistent. If I didn't know it was crab, I wouldn't know from tasting it. The only slight upside was the sprinkling of greens that gave it a crunch now and then.   Anyway, the food will seem a bit pretentious if you can't deliver on diverse offerings.   But nice people and unique restaurant hours.",

Flavor of the dish was a little overwhelmed by the amount of spicey sweet chili sauce, and would have been better with more veggies and fewer noodles, but I definitely enjoyed it. Food came quickly but table service was a bit chaotic, needing to flag down a server for a spoon & then again when it dropped on the floor; they appeared to be understaffed.

There were three of us in our group, and we were initially skeptical on how large the portions would be, and whether it would be enough for us. So we decided to order four items: buffalo pork shanks with bleu cheese crumbles, bulkogi lettuce wraps, house made charcuterie, pickles and bread, and cheese with some jam and toast. We were definitely impressed with not just the quantity of food, but the amazing quality of it as well. The lettuce wraps were by far my favorite, and they melt in your mouth and leave a taste of awesomeness behind, along with a craving for more. The buffalo pork shanks were my least favorite item, but overall, it was an amazing experience. We even had to box some stuff up for home, the meal was totally worth the money.

He was actually rolling his eyes when my mother asked about the salad on the menu. I was about to say something but chose to bite my tongue in the hopes that we would have some decent food on the way as we had been hungry for some time.  Long story short, I should have said something and walked out. Food was nothing special. They claim to make everything in house, which I believe, but to our dismay, it wasn't great. We got the charcuterie board, cheese burger, the \"Cuban Pickle Crisis\", an order of duck fries, and the shrimp po'boy.   The charcuterie board is 90% pickled vegetables and 10% meat. For ~$18, I should be getting a bit more than 2-3oz of meat (which was just OK). The more accurate name for this menu item would be \"pickled vegetable board with some samples of meat\".   The shrimp po'boy had literally five shrimp (size U25-30, aka small). Five, you guys. I paid like $16 for this sandwich with a side of way-overdressed salad to the point of sogginess.    Overall, solid 2/5. Duck fries were good, but it's hard to mess up something with three ingredients. I could see this place having merits for the bar scene, but not much else. The staff's sh*t attitude certainly didn't help either.",

    "text": "This was so NOT what we were expecting. We truly expected a quaint little pub bistro feel with some great food. Hmmmm.   First off, the music is quite loud and the tables in the dining area were so high up, they come up to almost level with our chins. The waiter came by to make his suggestions. They were definitely his! AND we just couldn't hear each other. The waiter suggested giving us the tomato salad as an appetizer. I understood him to say it would be an appetizer \"size\". Then I finally ordered a \"Nancy\" sandwich. I thought it was a burger given the price and the location on the menu.   I was WRONG  on both counts.    The salad came and seemed appetizer size. NOPE. It was a hefty $14.50 for a small bed of arugula and a few slices of heirloom and cherry tomatoes topped with cream fresh. Then the \"Nancy\" came. I guess I read the menu wrong as it was listed under MAIN plates. Instead, I got a Brie sandwich with two slivers of avocado, onion, tomato, and a small garden salad. My partner couldn't eat the Brie. She said it was tainted. I ate about half.   When the waiter came back, I politely told him I thought our Nancy was a burger. He said: Oh no! I just thought you two were the Vegetarian types. He smiled and left. What??? ....BUT IF that were True, what are we doing going to \"Pig & Pickle\"?!?!?!?  Also, I was just shocked at the $13.50 charge for a cheese sandwich and $14.50 for a small rather simple tomato salad. The waiter insisted it came with a fresh baked roll and freshly made pickles. BTW They could keep the pickles. They were on the sweet side with some odd mixture of spices. Neither of us liked them at all.   Just feel it was a pricey experience.",

It's locally owned and independent, the food is amazing, the staff is super friendly (shoutout Chip and Jake), and the atmosphere is excellent. I love coming here for late night after 10pm, which has its own menu and drink specials. You can get some super nice craft beers for $5! Late night is also the only time they have the duck fat fryer on -- try the duck fat fries (I love them extra crispy!).  I can not say enough good things about the food. I've never been disappointed. My favorite late night menu item is the pork shoulder tostadas. I also came here for brunch once and got the eggs bene that was quite good.

    "text": "I made a point of it to get to Pig & Pickle for a couple of reasons (besides their interesting looking menu).  For one, I was told this place was super popular for late night eats.  Secondly (and most importantly), this is supposedly a favorite spot for professional chefs when they want to dine out and unwind.  In fact owner and head chef Keenan Bosworth is a big favorite of the so-called \"Arizona Seven Chefs\" (a collective of AZ chefs that were recently picked to serve a meal at the famed James Beard House).  I love pork.  I like pickles.  I think I'm ready to do this, so vamonos!  You'll find this monument to swine on Thomas just west of Scottsdale Road on the north side of the street.  I'm not much of a late night owl, but I was intrigued enough that I arrived here for happy hour on a Tuesday.  Saddling up to the bar, I glanced around the room to see just how many paintings, statues, piggy banks and other pig themed memorabilia adorned the interior (I stopped counting at 15).  Even the air inside of this place smells like pork (not overpoweringly so, but enough that the theme sets in).  The interior seats probably 50-60 with what looks like another dozen or so seats on the back patio.   Swine rules much of the menu here, but amongst the pork items include much more complex dishes including bone marrow, shrimp and grits, liver pate, and fois gras.  Understanding that the late night menu was a big hit here, I did some homework in advance of my visit to try and pick late night menu items that would be available as dinner and happy hour options.  That way I could at least partly replicate their late night experience.  For starters, a little happy hour cocktail.  I choose the one they call \"#scottsdaleproblems\".  House made limoncello, bitters, lime zest, and prosecco.  Palette awoken, it was time for the food.  For my appetizer, I went with the Pork Shoulder Tostadas.  Pulled pork shoulder, kimchi, greens, and a ginger aioli.  GRAND. SLAM.  Let me first say the tostada shells were perfect, crunchy, and held up beautifully and kept my pork in place the whole time.  But that pork, aioli, and kimchi mix was absolutely out of this world.  You MUST try these if you're coming here for the first time.  For my main entree, I braced myself for Apocalypse Sow.  A ground pork (not beef) burger, topped with tons of bacon, white cheddar, aioli, and grilled onions.  I love pork, but even this was a beast for me.  Burger might've been a little too well done for my taste, but the bacon and aioli were excellent.  I should also mention I got the burger with a side of their Dump Truck Salad.  Mixed greens, various shaved veggies, cucumber, seeds, and a shallot vinaigrette.  A nice pleasant cleanser for my meat orgy.  For dessert, they were offering a peanut butter and caramel bread pudding, to which I politely said \"yes please\".  In addition to the PB and caramel, the bread pudding is topped with vanilla bean ice cream and powdered sugar.  Healthy portion (probably meant for two or more) and I liked the fact the bread pudding wasn't soggy.  The dessert didn't blow me away, but it was a pretty tasty ending to a fun dining adventure.  Total cost for the drink, food, tax, and tip came to about $50.  As I sit here writing this I'm still recovering from an epic case of the meat sweats (thanks to the combo of pork tostadas and a pork orgy of a burger), but glad I gave this place a try.  I will absolutely come back for the tostadas and if I do at some point need a late night fix in Scottsdale, Keenan's place will be one of the first places I look up.  With a laid back unpretentious vibe and slightly upscale mix of choices on their menu, I can completely understand why chefs and night owls would pick this place for a relaxed meal and beverage.  Pork fan or not, chances are you'll find at least one thing especially for you on the menu here.  Hell, I found four!",

Boy were we wrong, and pleasantly surprised. It's truly fabulous! The atmosphere is casual and easy going, but the food is sophisticated and delicious, and the price is seriously reasonable for the quality.  I had the pork shank and my husband had the skirt steak.  The flavors were savory and delicious, and beautifully combined with the sides on each entree. Mine was so large, I took 1/2 of it home. But I'm getting ahead of myself... you must try the fried brussel sprouts appetizer with a fried egg on top... amazing! And we had to have the bacon bourbon bread pudding for dessert... makes my mouth water thinking about it. My only complaint is that they don't have decaf coffee... I mean who doesn't serve decaf??

Started off with the street corn. Very simple, and tasty with the perfect amount of spice. Ordered the apocalypse sow. It was a bit overwhelming and messy but I found it to be very enjoyable when I broke it down and ate it with a fork and knife. I was glad I ordered the tots with the meal. They change daily but mine were panko crusted with a mashed potato and sausage filling. Delicious. The service was excellent and the owner was there greeting the guests which is always a good sign.

There were very few dining at that time, I'm told all the craze happens at night and for good reason, the place is hip and has a great atmosphere. That being said, people are missing out on their fantastic lunch menu. The bar selections are unique and there are a great many to choose from. We ordered the fried brussel sprouts and pork shoulder tostadas to start. They were both Delicious. We then went on to order the udon noodles and grilled hanger steak for our main dishes. Again, both were delicious! The steak was very juicy and full of flavor! The udon noodle dish was sweet, spicy, nutty and covered with a great assortment of fresh vegetables.  Great service, great food, great atmosphere!",

Remember that Whiskey, Green Spot. YOU WILL LOVE IT! before the Green Spot, I tried several other drinks which where all awesome, I can't remember their names because after four or five of them I have my first shot of Green Spot and that was all she wrote. I now am regularly purchasing all that I can get my hands on. Oh yeah the food. It was the best pickled EVERYTHING I have ever had. Even the odd pink pickled hard boiled eggs were good.

When I sat down I told myself no cocktails... Until the drink menu arrived. With a full list of hand crafted cocktails at your fingertips, how do you not go for it? Especially during happy hour? I couldn't and you shouldn't either. Mine was so refreshing I'm not even sorry.   I ordered the clams served in wine and essence of heaven. I loved every bite. It was a little spicy for my sensitive pallet but it was worth it. The bread, that they bake themselves, was incredible. Our waiter was very kind and patient, giving lots of great advice.

The vibe is eclectic and the menu is great. I've been here mid day, dinner time, and late at night. I've never had to wait too long to get greeted and seated. I also have common sense and understand that if it's a Friday night, they are going to busy so it might take a minute like any other place on the weekends.   Food and service; I've never had a problem. The waiter even took something off my bill because he realized I only took 1 bite from it. He asked if I liked it and my response was \"it's not my favorite, the rest is great\". On a friday, that is amazing service. Most waiters/waitresses I've had never pick up on that and never go above and beyond like that hence why this gets a 5 stars for detail oriented service. I didn't even expect him to notice. They have great craft beers and the waiters know what to recommend.   Reminder, this is a gastropub. If you are expecting something super fancy and stiff, this isn't it. Go somewhere else. This is a good place where you can kick back and get together with your friends and have a good time with better food. A gem that reminds me of many bars and gastropubs I've missed since I've moved from Washington.",

Let me start by first saying the staff was above average, very friendly, attentive and happy to recommend different menu items. We started with 2 small apps, the lamb sliders & tacos. The tacos were very flavorful and easily our favorite of the evening. The lamb sliders looked and smelled promising, but were rather dry. I would give these another shot, perhaps ask to have them medium rare (I wasn't given an option). We decided to split the BLT after reading the reviews, I really wish we hadn't. The pork belly wasn't crispy at all and rather bland. Very disappointing, we should've ordered the Apocalypse Sow. There are so many different restaurant options in Scottsdale, I have to say we left underwhelmed. Maybe it was just an off night.",

After that,  out server came around very rarely and didn't have much personality.    We like to try house cocktails,  and ordered two of their specialty drinks;  mine was decent (a pig and pickle take on an old fashioned) but my husband's was gross. He ordered one of their aged cocktails and it was so sweet he couldn't finish it. After that, we stuck to wine.   For dinner we ordered a pork burger and shrimp and grits. My husband's burger was really good,  but my dish was disappointing.  The menu didn't disclose that the shrimp and grits would be buried under a mess of sauce (some sort of tomato sauce I believe). The shrimp didn't seem to be seasoned at all, and were few and far between. The Andouille sausage overpowered the dish.",

    "text": "In a nutshell: night time disappointment and worst $50 I ever spent.  I don't even know how to begin with this review.  I came in with upbeat expectations.  I saw their late night menu and got really excited because of the bone marrow and duck fat fries.  I ordered both and also the burger with Bleu cheese.  My husband ordered the chicken fingers and my brother-in-law ordered the tacos and an extra order of fries.  The bone marrow and fries came out first.  We were instantly disappointed with the fries.  It had no duck flavor and while they were crispy, were super bland.    The bone marrow was okay but I had better when I went to this buffet in a Las Vegas hotel.  The garlic was so burnt it tasted bitter.  The highlight was some of the attached meat that had been super roasted.  It was crispy and tasty  but so little of it.  Then came the tacos.  They were cold and the tortilla stiff.  My brother-in-law returned the other order.  Cold shrimp on a stiff tortilla are a torture device, not edible food.    My burger came next.  My burger meat was lukewarm at best while my hamburger bun was cold, like out of the fridge cold.  And they gave me cheddar cheese.   I never thought that a burger can be ruined.  I usually order one because it is fool-proof and prevents me from leaving bad reviews.   My husband ate his chicken fingers and that is that.  Maybe what our experience was an outlier.  I don't know but I don't ever want to return to this place and neither do my husband and brother-in-law.",

When can we move on from the hipster don't give a shit vibe.  It's old, so move on.   Happy hour is decent.  $5 buck Mac n cheese which is so rich and delicious.  Worth the indulgence!!   Fried Brussels were perfectly crisp and salted, but the egg on top was a bit over cooked.    Not sure how fast I'll return.  As much as I loved the food I also would like service to be on par.",

    "text": "I never give five stars  This could easily be a grungy place, but they dress it up. I would of kind of preferred it to be a grungy bar with pool, darts, ping-pong and a digital jukebox, but keep the food quality what it is, but I can also hang with it being a traditional eatery with tables and a detached bar.   I like the food. The bulgogi (for lack of a better term) tastes good n tender. Tender pieces of meat, not overly seasoned, not overly garnished, on green leaves. It's a bit pricey for the quantity of meat, but I paid it because it looked good and seemed like it tasted good. And it did  I was served a longboard, which isn't the hefeweizen beer I requested, but it was the closest that they had. Hipster places like this are more likely to have hoppy IPAs, which I like to avoid  The guy with the tatts and the large gauge earring looked intimidating, but you can tell he knows his stuff. The black waitress was very nice and provided good service. There was a laid-back vibe to the place, which I enjoyed  Many of the prices quoted for the food on the Yelp pictures were lower than the actual cost by a few bucks. I noticed that but I guess if stuff is popular then the price increases and that's how they eventually make more money. As long as the guests are willing to pay, why not  Finally, I like the fact that their beer list changes weekly according to the menu   I would come back, and would recommend it to a friend",

    "text": "I was hungry and ready to eat like a pig after seeing the Wonderspaces exhibit at the mall and initially tried to get Kona Grill's happy hour to only find out all tables were taken. A short walk to Culinary Dropout to try their happy hour menu fared no better, as it would have been a 30 minute wait just for a table. This put us in a bit of a pickle, as we were 0/2 on restaurant picks. A search on Yelp reminded me that I've wanted to try out Pig & Pickle, despite just missing out on their happy hour. It was time to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear and go whole hog at this spot for fine swine!  Seating was plentiful here and we took a seat at one of the tables. I noticed right away that either the table was too high or the chairs too low (Or both?) because I felt like I was a kid sitting at an adult's table here. Odd table aside, the menu looked intriguing and I love how they ham it up by using names such as the apocalypse sow and Cuban pickle crisis. I figured when at a place with pig in the name, might as well get pork, amirite? We ended up sharing the roasted bone marrow appetizer and I had the BLT.  Timing seemed a bit off as we had ordered the bone marrow appetizer way before we ordered our entrees, yet the entrees came out first. When it did come out though it was worth the wait! The marrow came with an ample amount of little crostini, with celery leaves, green onion, pickled onions and pickled blueberries. I'm not a big fan of celery so I didn't have a lot of it with the bone marrow and crostini but I did like the marinade on the onions and especially the unique nature of the pickled blueberries. The marrow itself was a lovely and indulgent spread. I always think of marrow as \"meat butter\" when I order it lol.  The BLT turned out to be a bit of a pig in a poke for me. It consisted of pork Belly, butter Lettuce, and grape Tomatoes. This meal was an open faced sandwich which made it look like a pork boat! From looking at other photos I was expecting a regular closed type of sandwich. Perhaps making a note in the menu description would help other customers so they are also aware. Since it was such a big porky sandwich boat it was hard for me to eat without different elements going overboard off onto my plate. The individual ingredients were well prepared and high quality, but for me I would have preferred a more traditional type of sandwich. You get your choice of side, I went with the \"dump truck\" salad which had a delightful blend of ingredients (Despite the pig-pen sounding name) paired with a tasty vinaigrette.  The bathroom was alright, no pig sty here, although there were some conspicuous cutouts on the ceiling for some reason. Perhaps someone performed a Mission Impossible like heist and made a quick getaway here (Ethan Hunt was unavailable for questioning, perhaps he was too busy munching on an apocalypse sow).  Prices are on par with other restaurants in the Scottsdale area, so break into that piggy bank as needed. Our total for two sandwiches and sharing the appetizer was around $50.",

This place is by itself when talking the type of cuisine , the chefs are True craftsmen  at what they put out . My only concern this time was service seemed not too attentive , wasn't busy , it just seemed to miss a little on that . Great place , flavors of the shrimp and grits alone made me a dedicated fan",

I came here with a large group for an event meetup and they had a nice table reserved for us and the staff was friendly and nice.  The service was good.  The server did not have or offer much advice for vegans.  I basically was told I could get a salad, which is generally very routine and boring for vegans to have as the only option.  I specifically asked about the Korean noodle dish, but was told that was made with fish sauce, so it wouldn't work.   I ordered no food and decided to focus on drinks.  A little way down the table, another vegetarian DID get the Korean noodle dish without the fish sauce and with hot sauce instead, which looked pretty good, but I don't know if that would be vegan or not, and by then I was fully just having liquid dinner and had given up on food by then, so I didn't bother asking again.  The drinks were good and the rest of the group seemed to enjoy their dinners.",

Plus an early and late version of HH.  This is one of those blink and you would miss it and definitely not on the radar for most visitors unless a local pointed you in their direction. It definitely has a cozy, neighborhood feel once inside that belies the edge of the strip mall location.   I happened upon the P & P after a charity golf tournament in the area. Some of the players in our group couldn't say enough good things about the P and P. We decided to meet up after getting cleaned up later in the evening. As the night meandered on the place began to fill with servers, bar keeps and chefs and all manner of industry folks made their way over.   We had already managed to grab several of the somewhat limited seating at the bar to sample some of the tasty treats on special after 10.  The pork shoulder tostados were my favorite, make no mistake there is a reason the word Pig is in their title. They have more than a few dishes with divine swine involved.   We also tried the duck fat fries( only late night) and the Bulgogi lettuce wraps. I have to say yes again to the fries but no to the lettuce wraps. The beef was just too sinew laden, chewy and tough and way too salty.   All in all the small group of us found the staff and barkeep super friendly, attentive and just made for a better dining and drinking experience. The place isn't so loud you or crowded that you can't have a conversation even as it fills up. I am sure it can get shoulder to shoulder during it's busiest hours but we didn't have that experience.  A nice hidden but not so secret neighborhood gem.",

The meat in the taco was super flavorful and there was a pickled pepper in the mix somewhere that was really amazing. I had heard about their tater tots, so I ordered 3. The tots are not like the normal ones. They are large pieces that have different flavors. I got a pulled pork one. It was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Came with a great aioli sauce. The chefs actually comped me one more tot too! The service was great. My waitress was friendly. I will be coming back again to try more items in the menu!",

My fiance had an old fashioned and I tried a specialty cocktail with gin. Each only $5!! The lamb slider is to die for, although you only get one so we shared. The specialty taco on HH had andouille sausage, was super spicy-with pickled onions and pimento cheese- and delicious. Can't wait to go back. Anywhere with weekend happy hour and this level of deliciousness is my new fav.",

From the amazing owners (Clayton is one of the best guys to exist) to my favorite bartenders in Scottsdale (Skot and Tyler will become yours too just in one night) to the heavenly food (pork shanks) P&P should be your favorite too. One of the only restaurants to be open super late, Pig is home to a regular crowd of industry people which should say something when a bunch of servers and bartenders want to hang out there after a hellish shift. I promise if you go there once it will become one of your favorites over night.",

The food is always delicious and we love how they change things up from time to time. I would normally give this restaurant 5 stars. However, our last few visits have been for a night cap and dessert, ordered at the bar, and a specific bartender (whose name we do not know, but he has shoulder-length blonde hair), has been so condescending, sarcastic and almost rude to us the last two times we have been there, that I doubt we will ever be back. It's sad because this was one of our favorite and go-to places, but this one bartender has ruined it for us. The management at Pig & Pickle needs to recognize when one of their staff is treating customers with disrespect, especially customers who frequent regularly.",

My wonderful friends brought cupcakes to celebrate and when we brought them out they told us that we couldn't have them and that they would have to charge us $4 a cupcake to bring them in the back, add a scoop of ice cream and bring them back out to us. The problem wasn't so much that they wouldn't allow us to have them, the problem came when my husband tried to reason with the manager and he was a complete $@#. The manager literally said he had to charge us and serve them to us because it was a health code violation. Ummmmm, pretty sure you manhandling my cupcakes and adding ice cream to it has NOTHING to do with health code violations. That sad, pathetic excuse was all we needed to seal the deal.  Needless to say we said thanks but no thanks and ate them in the parking lot. Sad for them because we would have ordered a few more round of drinks and spent a lot more than $4 a cupcake! Our supper club will never come back and we would recommend to anyone celebrating a special day NOT to show up here. Ridiculous!",

The dining room is decorated with a giant wall of the silhouette of a pig and the rest of the room with local artwork, including a gangster Marilyn Monroe, I'm a fan. The drinks list included small batch boozes along with great beers by the bottle and tap.   On to the best part of the place, of course, the food.  We all ordered different things to share and get a full experience of their late night menu.  Different than their regular hours menu of course.  I got the pork tostadas with kim chee and the pickles plate.  Both were delicious and the kim chee actually had a little funk to it that I appreciate.  The pickles were great too and a  good assortment with grapes being the star along with green beans, fennel, beets, and onions.  My friends got the burger which was juicy and cooked perfectly on a flatbread that fell apart a little bit.  We also all tried the Tot of the day which was prosciutto and some sort of cheese that I forget, also tasty.  Possibly the best tot I've had.  We also tried the croque madam which was executed well with creamy mornay and perfect runny eggs but the star of the night was the braised pork leg which anyone there late night must have.  Perfectly tender with a crispy sear and delicious braised butter beans with tomatoes.   Pig and Pickle is worth every penny and I will sure be back for my late night after work cravings for local goodness.  Oh did I mention 2.50 tall boy PBRs and coozies lol.",

    "text": "I don't understand what everyone is raving about.  After watching Detour's Tavern die a quick death I had really high hopes for Pig and Pickle as it is close to my house.    Went there Saturday night and were underwhelmed.  When we walked in the hostess seemed confused and a waiter was trying to seat us.  There was no structure to how the place was running right from the start.  It is over priced too.  We ordered a 1 sandwich, 1 appetizer and 1 salad.  Add 1 draft beer and 1 Margarita...$60 after tip.  We left hungry because the portions were so small.  The food did taste decent, there just simply wasn't much there.  We got the pork belly appetizer and there were 3 small pieces...it was $10.  We got one of the Sammie's and it was 80% bread with a small amount of pork inside of it.  At one point, I was eating just bread.  The dump truck salad was simply a bowl of mixed green's with hardly any salad dressing...$11.  On top of being underwhelmed by the food, the service was poor at best.  We got our salad before our appetizer and sat around for stretches of 10-15 minutes with no food or drinks.  When we asked for the check, we sat for another 15 minutes waiting.  Keep in mind, this place is small and our server literally had 3 tables to worry about.  I went into the Detour's Tavern one time and thought, \"Wow, this place has so much potential but it won't last here based on this experience.\"  Same thought I had at Pig and Pickle.  It will be gone in 6 months.  It's a place you will walk in to try out and never return to because it is pricey and you don't get much.  There is no reason to go back there.  For $60 I can think of 10 other places I would rather eat that are way better.  I wish someone would just put in a nice sports bar or good pizza joint in this location.  Stop trying to make it something it isn't.  In North Scottsdale this place might survive with better service, but not in South Scottsdale.",

No worries, the bf was just glad to have a tv with the game on in front of him.  Checked out the drink menu at the bar for a few minutes... Nice beer selection and good drink prices!  They have craft cocktails, but I went for a beer since they had Konig Ludwig. =)  For dinner, I debated on the pork tostadas and the vegan burger with bacon... The bacon is a FREE add-on!!  The waitress suggested pork tostadas, so thats what I had.  Quite tasty!! There were 3 tostadas with piles of pork! They had a great ginger aioli and crunchy/spicy kimchee. 2 of them filled me up, but I went ahead and ate the 3rd one since the bf was too full from his tri-tip dinner.  Needless to say, neither one of us had room for dessert.  The service was good and friendly and overall it was a good dinner.  The only thing I didn't care for was the $3 charge for a soda water at the bar when I ordered a beer. Fizzy water for 3 bucks?!  My bf almost exclusively chooses soda water/club soda over flat water, and I have never been charged for it when it comes out of the tap.  Just sayin.",

This is a True Gastropub in the best sense of that world. \"Gastro\" meaning culinary delights await you, complex but familiar flavors, excellent pairings, innovative interpretations. \"Pub\" meaning the vibe is casual and welcoming while still being nice enough you can bring a date here. Both times we went there has been live music, which was fantastic. Not so loud you couldn't talk, but definitely added to the groovy atmosphere. Now to specifics on food. Order the small plates and order a lot of them. We haven't had a bad one yet. Particular favorites are the bone marrow (unctuous and decadent), pork shoulder tostadas (SO FLAVORFUL!), and fried brussel sprouts (add a second egg, totally worth it). Everything executed flawlessly, flavors spot on. If you're a fan of cider, I highly recommend ordering the Finnriver Habanero Cider. Lots of other creative drink options too. One of our favorite restaurants ever.",

    "text": "Let start with the fact that if I could I'd give 3.5 stars but since I cannot, I have to go with 3 as it defiantly wasn't a 4 star experience. Came here last night for a birthday dinner. We were in their private room which was actually quite large and very nice to be able to have everyone at one large table. We had one waiter, Anthony, who was on point- constantly filling up glasses, bringing extra things we needed right away, and giving great dessert recommendations. I knocked off 2 stars because I was completely underwhelmed with the food I ordered. We started with the beef marrow and crostini and it was very tasty; first time having it and won't be my last. However I ordered the 'apocalypse sow' burger and it was a bad combination of flavors. Essentially it was a pork, sausage flavored, patty with sambal aioli, wwaaaaayyy to sharp white cheddar, some lettuce, and three strips of bacon. All the flavors were competing with each other too much and created an overall unpleasant flavor. I wasn't the only one who felt this way either, 3 other guest ordered the same thing and didn't enjoy it. We got the seared carrot cake and bread pudding to share with everyone for dessert, the bread pudding was Anthony's recommendation. The carrot cake was seriously lacking in the carrot flavor department but the whipped goat cheese frosting on top was okay. Surprisingly, the bread pudding was probably the stand out as the best thing I tried there last night.  I will go back to try their happy hour or late night menus but I most likely won't be dinning off their dinner menu again. Overall- Service-5 Decor/Space-5 Price-4 Food-3",

Restaurant itself is nicely appointed and has a good feel. Service was friendly and attentive. Food wasn't quite what I was hoping for though. We had the bone marrow and pork shoulder tostadas to start. Bone marrow was nice - enjoyed the onion jam and pickled onions it came with - nice compliments. The tostadas didn't work for us though - the ginger aioli lacked much ginger and there was just way too much of it. The duck leg was excellent itself, but the bean cake it came with didn't do much for me, and the bean sprouts and cabbage slivers on top didn't do much for the plating or the dish over. The pot-roast sammie was good, but the fries were barely warm and no longer crispy - which was a bummer.  I'd probably give this another shot as I liked the concept, but probably not in a big hurry to go back. Pricing generally good, though if they shave a dollar or two off the apps that would help.",

The inner portion was a little bit spicy and the outer portion was like bacon--but better (how is that possible?). I also had the pork tacos with kimchi and they were great! Tender, shredded pork with kimchi on top. The kimchi wasn't at all overwhelming.  And for dessert--the nutella ice cream. This is a game changer for me! I don't usually order dessert because I always overdo it during dinner, but thankfully my date insisted. It was delicious and I found myself continuing to dream about that ice cream and figure out when I can have it again.

    "text": "Pig & Pickle is an upscale eatery in South Scottsdale - the type where you can see the kitchen and the chefs doing their thing while wearing crisp chef uniforms - the type of place where you can't have things the way you want. The dishes come how they are listed on the menu. No onions? Sorry, this isn't burger king - you can't have it your way. This is the sort of joint where the food is almost art and they don't want diners second guessing the expertise of the artists in the kitchen.  I find this sort of thing to be a bit pretentious, but at the same time I do appreciate going to places like this - as a treat. The menu is filled with really unique dishes and it's definitely aspiring above the neighborhood. It'll be interesting to see if they last in this spot. I sincerely hope they do. It can only bring up the game of the area.   My gf and I tried each other's dishes and we definitely had a wide sampling of desserts and entrees. We were about 50/50 on the dishes. We liked the sandwich and the bread and thought the desserts were fantastic, but felt a few of the dishes and items to be lacking. It was a mixed bag really, but as we were told - they are really new and still experimenting and finding their stride.  If they lower their self-importance level a bit and offer up a little more variety, they will make more friends. So far though, it looks like they don't need too much help. The server told us they have been really busy since they opened. Speaking of which - service was a bit slow and spotty, but he was super nice, professional and went out of his way for us.   I'm giving 3 stars because I liked it, but I see room for improvement. I will definitely be back, and I plan to bump this up to 4 if they iron out the kinks. They probably deserve a 4, but I feel like at these prices and presentation - things should be a little tighter... expectations are a bit higher.",

    "text": "I was SO excited to hear about this place opening up just a short drive/nice walk from my apartment, as there is nothing remotely this interesting menu-wise in this area. However, I found myself getting disappointed over and over throughout my experience here.   First, the bad stuff:  Bf and I walked in and it took at least five full minutes before anyone even acknowledged us...and there's not really a host stand or any signs indicating if one should seat themselves or to wait to be directed by a host to a table. We stood there looking hopeless and hungry, trying to catch the eye of anyone on the waitstaff who all ignored us before someone came from behind the bar and greeted us, seating us at a table near the bar area. The space is beautiful and huge-I never went here when it was Detours but was surprised it was so spacious as it doesn't seem like it would be from the outside.   The service was pretty much awful, the waitress taking FOREVER to put in any orders (she only had a few tables from what we could tell...and I've been a waitress before so I know how long these things should take!). The first drinks took a while to get to us, and she didn't take our order until wayyyy after our drinks were delivered, despite the numerous attempts at eye contact. We had to actually reach out and tap her when she was walking by to get her attention, not a good sign. After our apps, we had to wait another longgg while before entrees arrived.   When I wanted a second cocktail I waited...and waited...and waited some more. Then I decided to just go on up to the bar myself as I saw the waitress still hadn't put the order in, and told the bartender that I had ordered from the waitress but that I didn't think she had put it in yet, and he was not surprised-he said she did the same thing with my first drink! Well that explains why it took forever to get either round of drinks...the waitress wasn't putting them in the computer after I ordered them. And no, even though I had to wait forever and order it myself they didn't take it off the bill like most places would, most likely because no one noticed. I didn't want to make a scene and it wasn't that big of a deal, but most restaurants I frequent would NEVER let something like that happen. Just sayin'.   Now onto the good stuff:  The menu at this place has SO much creativity and potential! We ordered the pork shoulder tostadas for an app and this was an amazingly delicious dish...I just wish there was more of it. It was three teeny tiny corn tortilla shells topped with the pork shoulder mixture that had a seasoning so delicious, I was literally spooning the juice left over from the plate into my mouth. I had a long time to sit with this empty app dish before the waitress ever came by to take our entree order, so I got to enjoy the plate juice for quite a while.   The menu here reminds me of my favorite restaurant's menu, noca. Bacon and me get along well, and I was 100% ready to fall in love with this restaurant when I saw they had *FREE* bacon on their vegan burger! I love vegan food AND I love bacon, so this was a theoretical match made in heaven. Now, many vegan burgers have corn in them, so I asked if this was made with corn because my stomach+whole corn kernels=bad, and the waitress assured me that while it was made with corn, it was \"all mixed up in there, it's not very much and you don't even know it's in there\". I was surprised to see that there was TONS of corn in whole kernel form alllll up in that burger. Luckily I was able to pick it out, though that left very little \"burger\" left to eat, but just be warned if you have any corn issues that this burger is not for you.   However, if you love regular beef burgers, the burger here is fantastic! Bf ordered this and it was amazingly tasty-he got it with bacon and it was heavenly. Bacon costs $2.50 extra on non-vegan burgers, fyi. He ordered fries but the waitress brought him salad instead, though once he mentioned it she did have someone bring over fries and they were decent. The salad wasn't anything to write home about, I had one as my side dish as well.  I'd love to chalk the bad service up to this place being new, because the menu is just too enticing to ignore, especially since it's walking distance from my apartment! I am not giving up on this place just yet, fingers crossed that the service improves.",

    "text": "I met up with a good buddy of mine for a little catchup, a little ambience, and some yummy food.  We were excited to try this place for the first time so here's how it turned out:  Great parking was a pleasant surprise when we arrived at 6 on a Friday night.  I live in Central Phoenix so hardly ever encounter that treat.  Got there before my buddy and was warmly greeted before being seated.  The interior was lovely, warmly lit, and had a nicely-moderated noise level (another pleasant surprise).  The patio had gas heaters and some comfortably upholstered seating so we settled in to get caught up.  I'm on a bourbon kick right now so my server recommended a delicious cocktail.  It also had Rye in it and was pink.  Yummy!  My pal had something equally delish with gin and blackberry.  Equally delish!  This joint has some signatures, one of which is tater tots.  The selection on Friday had baked beans with a side of barbecue sauce.  Wow, they are just yummy!  We both ordered a sandwich based on our server's suggestion.  It was a kind of pork burger, covered with bacon, and it was good.  My only quibble is that it seemed overly salty to me and may benefit from toppings that balance the pork out a bit.  We both had the fries and our server brought us both ketchup and barbecue sauce for dipping.  A nice gentleman came out to ask about our experience and he seemed genuinely interested in our feedback.  So....the next visit will be focused on tots, pink drinks, and a new treat.  I'm looking forward to it!",

The entrees were a little disappointing. I tried the porchetta and the duck. The porchetta was way overcooked and dry and the gnocchi that accompanied it was burnt on one side and raw on the other. The orange sauce on the duck was too sweet for me and the duck itself was a little chewy. I would've loved a crispy skin on the bird as well.",

There is not a month that goes by where I am not in some other large US city having  a nice meal and I have to say that the Pig & Pickle competes toe to toe.  This will for sure be a Top 20 Phoenix-Metro Restaurant!  I am already planning on being back in a few days.  Awesome service, great personalities with the staff, cool atmosphere, great drinks and absolutely ridiculously yummy food.  It has the friendliness of the Mid-West, a feel of a Kansas City steak restaurant, an eclectic menu of a San Francisco hot spot, and the cozy atmosphere of a Cheers bar.  Do yourself a favor and just go!!",

Steak was ordered medium, came out with COLD center. Wouldn't even qualify for rare. Another party member ordered a sandwich, had extremely soggy bread. Yet another problem with the peanut and noodle dish--was essentially a soup-like mess.   Waited 10 minutes for check. Will never visit again.   Bottom line: EXTREMELY overpriced, subpar food, and snooty service.",

    "text": "It was with great excitement that I visited Pig & Pickle last Saturday. I went inside with wide eyes and the enthusiasm of a child on Christmas. Something so urban and hip in my little neighborhood of South Scottsdale! Yes, please and thanks in advance.  After dining, I am actually a little torn. There was stuff that was absolutely outstanding, and stuff that was just plain not good.  I'll start with the outstanding.  I personally don't really eat pork OR beef, but I figured when in Rome... I ordered the pot roast sammie, and seriously, I thought I was going to pass out from deliciousness. It tasted just like the amazing, tender pot roast that my mom used to make. It was topped with creamy cheese and caramelized onions. I'll be hard pressed to venture out and try anything new because this was just soooo good.  We also ordered desert after our meal, which if that is all I was reviewing this would be five stars without hesitation. The deserts were creative, delicious, not outrageously sized and are leaving me salivating just thinking about them.   The beer list was long, and the server was happy to offer recommendations. He was generally a friendly guy and explained the menu well when we had questions.  Now for the just plain not good....  Unfortunately, I have to mirror the sentiments of other reviewers and say that while very friendly, the service was poor. Wait times were long even though the place wasn't packed, and we sat with a table almost completely covered in empty dishes for most of our meal. We almost cleaned off our own table at one point just to have some room, but luckily our server eventually figured it out. I hate to say that because he was very nice, but they missed the mark on some basics of service.  The tots. I feel like I'm going to be mobbed for saying this, but to me- they weren't good at all. Maybe I was disappointed after assuming I'd get a traditional \"tot\", or maybe the tot of the day wasn't my fave, but I could only manage to eat half of one.  The tot was a \"Philly Cheesesteak\" and to me it was less tot and more fried mashed potato ball with peppers and steak. Not good, unfortunately. I will be totally open to trying them again in the hopes that the flavor of the day just didn't do it for me.  The cost wasn't outrageous but maybe a little high for the neighborhood. I didn't mind paying it, but some might balk at the prices.  Overall, I will be back, and am looking forward to it. I just know what I'll avoid this time. Hopefully they get their service in check and get their processes streamlined. I have faith in this place, and I hope it inspires other creative, indie eateries to spring up in South Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I was a first timer here for dinner and was less than thrilled with the service and flavor and texture of the food. We were generally left to our own devices, which is fine because this was a new restaurant and  they were busy and understaffed. The waiter attempted to make up for it by making small take, asking if I got the reference to the name of one of their 'hipsterfied' cocktails; but it was an awkwardly failed attempt. There was an audible and obvious miscommunication concerning our appetizers. We were seating next to order pick up, and our waiter called the chef 'such a fuckin bitch.' Working in a career where others determine your outcome can be frustrating, but really bruh? A fucking bitch in front of the customers and babies??? He apologized to the chef, who also declined his apology. The food was 'hipstered' up...cool name/description, lack of depth of flavor and odd textures. We orders the 'fried' Brussel sprouts and added bacon. The Brussels sprouts were clearly pan seared and the bacon was the only flavor. Our pork belly came out 40 min later, and the texture was odd. It was accompanied by collard greens that were very acidic and surprisingly delicious pomegranate seeds. The pomegranate seeds were the best thing we ate here. For my main course, I had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp were nice sized, but over cooked and chewy. The grits were hidden under some orange broth and they absorbed the liquid and became very wet. The andouille sausage was overlooked and hard. Atmosphere could be fun, but not worth returning to.",

It's good to see that the people who work there, eat there. Really good sign.   However, I hope that they don't eat there every day. The food is so rich! I'm going to make this a once a month stop. I'll get as big as a house if I try that.   The beer? INCREDIBLE. If they have the Yeti- drink it.   The food? Shut your whore mouth. It was SO good.

Of the five entrees ordered, nothing rocked my boat all that much, nothing wrong, but nothing right.   On the up side, the service was excellent. The waiter was really nice & didn't seem to be bothered by my family's tendency to be a little boisterous.   One thing that did annoy me... I was the designated driver, so I ordered a diet cola with dinner. Out came a diet cola in a cute bottle. It was good but not no refills good for a three dollar soda.

I had porkbelly with heirloom tomatoes as an appetizer over boston bibb,  and Mussel with Creme fraiche and chorizo for the main coarse.  My waiter was a little out to lunch, however, the guy who brought the water was very attentive and checked in on me.  I wish he got the entire tip.  The food.  The tomatoes and dressing were awesome, the pork belly on it's own was decent but the tomato brought out the flavor.  It was like a fancy blt without the bread.  I like the chorizo because it seemed like it was locally sourced.  Not like the fatty chorizo at the buttcher shop in Charlotte.  The muscles seemed a tad overdone.  Overall, the combination was about $40 and the 3.5 rating reflects it was good, priced about right for what I would expect.  But  I wasn't wowed, which I want for any price point-  i.e. a $10 cubano for for lunch I'm trying to objectively compare it to the same price point and rate the flavor accordingly.  So it was good.  I may try them again on my visit as the ribeye infused with truffles sounds pretty good, but I hope to be impressed on a second visit.",

After being dragged here on several occasions by a good friend, its quickly become a regular in my cache of frequented bars in the 'hood.   Not only because of my dearly beloved brussels sprouts with deliciously oozy egg on top, not only because of the constantly changing, seasonal menu that keeps it interesting, but most of all... the bartenders! Seriously the best. Prepare to have your tastes challenged-they love giving recommendations. They take so much pride in what they do, in *not* being your run of the mill bar. If you like whiskey like me, you'll love this place. And, with a certified sommelier on hand, you can guarantee you're in good hands. She's great.   I always appreciate when restaurants/bars go out of their way to source the best ingredients, and this place definitely lives up to that standard. All of the cocktails are fantastic and not cloyingly sweet. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the patio leaves a bit to be desired because the view isn't that great BUT they do give you a peanut butter dog biscuit if you bring Fido so go ahead.",

Grabbed a seat at the bar and immediately had a menu and two waters.  Bartender help my girl out with her mixed drink which was a ginger tequila.  Not a tequila guy but darn did that taste great.  Bartender definitely took his time making it and could tell he cared how everything was.  Now of course I went for the apocalypse \"sow\" which made this a 5 star review.  Very tender pork burger, homemade aioli and of course bacon and cheese.  Not much else but not much else was needed.  The spices and tenderness said it all.  Served with a side of homemade fries that were perfect.  Fiance had the shrimp and grits.  She loved it, Looked awesome, ample size but I was so focused on my burger I was full by the time I thought about a bite.    Will I be back? You bet....Will I be back this week?  You bet!",

I came here after happy hour at another restaurant with a friend.  He wanted to eat dinner and he loves pork (and pickles) so he chose this place.    Their cocktail list is pretty fabulous and has some funny names (The Dirty Sanchez was one of their cocktails.  Can you imagine someone ordering that?).    I ordered dessert, which was a Mississippi Mud Cake and The Maggie (a mixed drink).  The two did not complement one another, but the cake was FABULOUS.  I wonder who makes it for them?!  Is it made in house?  I must know these things.  My drink was also phenomenal, but not very strong.    I really liked the setup of the restaurant with the open kitchen.  I also liked the large piece of art of a skateboarder that was on the wall (but at $2K, it was not in my budget.  Plus, I don't have a wall to accommodate it.).    If I ate pork, I would definitely come back.",

Every meal is precisely the way they imagine it. I wonder how three magician like chefs get along but a mixologist, a bakery chef and a butcher walked into a bar (rimshot). Every thing has bacon in it beware. Veggie lovers say so because there will always be somthing for us to eat but don't be surprised if you get bacon infused jam.

Of course the food is great, why else would I be writing?   What strikes me is their commitment to their craft. They are brave in their offerings; dishes that aren't your standard fate, but mouthwatering nonetheless.  I appreciate restaurants that aren't afraid to push the envelope, all while sourcing responsibly and with quality in mind.  The food? I've eaten twice. You have to try the charcuterie plate. Insane. House made.  The Cuban pickle crisis looked picturesque when served and exploded in my mouth. Their salad was the best I've had and I don't even like salad or the idea of fruits and nuts in it. Go figure.  Try it. Blame me if you don't like Pig & Pickle.",

As soon as we entered it smelled heavenly of bacon, a lot of it.  The gentleman that sat us was very welcoming and friendly and continued to check on us throughout our meal which was nice.  We ordered some apple brandy mules and a couple of 'snacks'.  We tried the buffalo pork shanks and the Duck, Duck, Pig.  Both of these are very good sized plates.  While the pork was cooked very well and was nice and tender on the shanks, it came drowning in sauce which was a turnoff.  The DDP was nicely put together though and very tasty.  Drinks were great and service attentive, we would be back if we were in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "We have lived near Pig and Pickle for awhile and never went in thinking it was barbecue. Oh, how I regret not checking them out sooner.  This is, by far, the best restaurant meal I've had in years. Inventive, different, beautiful presentation and absolutely delicious food.  The chicharrones are amazing and the pork liver schmear was delicious. Crispy skinned trout - oh my goodness. Every bite was a mouth-watering delight.  Shrimp and grits had the perfect heat and loads of shrimp.  My husband loved his bacon burger with havarti and said it was perfectly cooked.  And desert was strawberry vinegar pie. Sounds weird, tastes wonderful.  This will be our new neighborhood favorite!   If you like inventive food with a twist you must try Pig and Pickle.",

The \"tator tots\" were lovely - they are actually fried mashed potatoes. Interesting concept but not sure I'd ever go back.",

It's probably my own fault for not looking at reviews closer, but the menu is different all day Sundays. We were looking for more of a lunch place, but they offered mostly breakfast items.   I decided to go with the hamburger and my only complaint was the bun. Not very tasty or anything special, seems like they just take it straight out of the store bought plastic. Maybe they only use this type on Sundays? The pictures didn't look like mine. hmmm.   Service: Our server was great, however there was a guy (supervisor?) walking around with a scowl the whole time. He had a pretty bitchy attitude, I could overhear him while eating.   Anyhoo, I will try again another time.",

Also the pickled okra on the side was the perfect after-bite for the marrow. I got the duck breast which was also delicious and my husband got the hanger steak which he also said was delicious. His steak could have used a touch more salt and my duck breast pears could have been a little more sweet if we were to be very detailed. The cheesecake was the perfect balance of vanilla and chocolate flavors with some kind of fruit compote. Everything was delicious and the customer service was exceptional. The place was also decorated with really cool pop art from a local artist.",

    "text": "Chef's Keenan Bosworth & Josh Riesner bring their unique style to a great location in South Scottsdale. Living in the area, and being a craft beer lover, I spent much time over at Papago & AZ Wine, and was treated to some of the culinary delights that these two create. I was extremely excited to hear that they were going to bring their wonderful food to a menu that I can afford. Show me a better late-night menu in town...   The place has a great decor, that took the existing layout and really incorporated the personalities of these guys. My first experience there was fantastic! Gulden Draak (98 rated on Ratebeer AND served in it's proper glassware) on tap, as well as another tasty European beer, Konig Ludwig. My first beer was free, as I was surprised to see my name on the top of the 'Give & Take' board by the bar. The concept is very cool, a good friend of mine, had previously purchased a beer for me to reclaim at any time. We had time to enjoy the brews, as the service was slow, but this was their first week, and Rome wasn't built in a day. Girlfriend and I shared a small 'Pickled Things' appetizer, while we waited for her favorite, risotto gnocchi with mushrooms, and my Wisconsin cheddar broccoli brown ale soup. Both were delicious, and made better by ordering a side of the homemade bread with smoked butter. We were both getting full, so weI decided to split the Nutella ice cream with brownie and toasted marshmellow. Now I don't typically order dessert, but this made me glad we did. Keep up the good work guys, planning on coming back very soon!",

Or maybe we've just had better.  My biggest complaint about both dishes is that it was surprisingly very lemon-y.  At first, I thought that since I had ordered fish, it must have been topped off with lemon juice because even my mashed potatoes tasted sour.  But my husband's entree was lemon-y too.  It was very bizarre.  Anyway, if we are going to pay around $20/person for fish and steak, I think we'll go somewhere else that uses less lemons in their dishes.",

We had been once before and it had been alright food but I wanted to give it another try since we live in the neighborhood and I had heard great reviews. We went for the late night service and called before I went to make sure they were still serving the waitress was hesitant to say yes even though there was over an hour of service left. I have worked in the food industry and if you're open your open you can't complain about your hours. When we got there the same lady helped us with our food. We ordered a couple drinks and asked what she recommended for food. She recommended the pork tostadas THEY WERE TERRIBLE. When she brought over the food it smelled rancid.... like she was serving us rotten meat. I ate one bite and couldn't take another. She never came back to our table to ask how her food was so I'm almost positive she did it on purpose because we didn't eat a single bite of it. I am not usually quick to judge but the behavior was unacceptable. We could never get her attention so we paid in cash and left. Terrible experience. We will never be back. So disappointed.",

With that said I'm writing this review because my wife and I went for a drink and bite to eat this past Saturday evening. P&P was celebrating their third birthday and it was fairly busy, but not to the point of out of control. Drinks were good like always and our server was friendly, like always. My concern was more about a comment he made and this is why I'm writing a review. My wife wanted a simple salad but it wasn't on the menu. Our server said he would ask the cooks to do something and then said they probably won't. He came back to the table and said they wouldn't do anything. He then called them princesses. Well listen princesses, the whole reason you are able to cook is because customers come in and spend their money. I hope you never forget that because as soon as you do the P&P will have issues like all the places there before it.... It's a slow slide and you won't notice right away... I will be back because I like the place but I say something now because I left with a bad taste in my mouth and I'd hate to see that become the norm.... I'm not sure why but the dessert menu was also limited to one type of cake that was not very good... One of the things I love most is going there late and having some home made ice cream... This may have been due to the event but I was surprised there were no other options... It wasn't even late. Got there around 9pm....",

The 3 of us started with drinks at the bar: great service, the drinks are reasonably priced (not cheap, but reasonably priced) and a great selection of beers. Then, after a short wait, off to a table for dinner. We planned to have appetizers and entrees but we never got past the \"starters\", they were so good and sooo filling.  Started with the \"tots\" (outrageously good, light, crunchy, great texture; like pillowy latkes, but better). Then the broccoli soup: very tasty, good texture and, of course, lots of pig on top. Then the charcuterie: meats were delicious and the pickles were even better, especially those amazing grapes. The highlight, though, was the pork belly. Had two orders, it was that good.   Eagerly looking forward to the next visit to try even more of that wonderful menu. THEY SURE CAN COOK!",

Lots of picked things on the board and delicious breads. Had a carrot soup there recently that was delicous. Very much like the liver smear on toast. It would be fun to have a table with my name on it if my work schedule allowed me more happy hours...the artwork is very fun and they sell it, also prints.

From the second he brought our table waters it was clear he didn't want to be serving me and the one other person I was with.  Once I ordered my entree he was immediately upset with my decision. He began arguing with me about what I should order instead, and started insulting me for not trying one of the entrees unique to the restaurant. Once he realized how rude he was acting he tried to make up for it by saying, \"I'm not trying to be a dick.\" I cant think of a more unprofessional phrase you can say to two people who you are supposed to be serving.  I am not easily offended, but he talked down to my table like we were idiots for having preferences outside of his own. The person I was with got the \"Apocalypse Sow\"  pork burger and it was not worth the $7, let alone the $15 they charge. The meal I ordered, which caused Sean such frustration, was the fish and chips. They weren't bad, but judging with my server's opinion of them Pig & Pickle should probably take them off the menu and stick to what he likes.  I will not be back, but my suggestion to anyone who decides to go would be if you have Sean as a server don't order something he doesn't like or you might anger him.",

They were large, fried mashed potato balls - you only get two with your meal (and a $1.50 additional charge) but they were well worth it. The only small complaint I have is regarding their alcohol. We ordered bloody Mary's and they left a bit to be desired, but were still on the pricey side. Next time, I'd probably just settle for a beer. Otherwise, great food, great atmosphere, and the host- who I think must have been the owner - was really friendly and helpful.",

Definitely NOT another \"anything\" this place is UNIQUE.  1. Public parking lot - No valet YAY huge plus! 2. Open floor plan, comfortable space between tables - full view of kitchen which is like watching a silent culinary opera, those guys are inspired (and quiet!) 3. Old Skool Cocktail menu - THANKS for the inspiration, I am terrible at ordering cocktails unless prompted by a creative menu listing.  I got something with Gin & Absinth in it and it complemented my meal perfectly!  French Press Coffee.  I'm a believer now, so fresh it made my tastebuds smile. Carrol Cake.  It's a deconstructed, fresh ingredient, dessert experience. Pork Tostado Starter.  and Finisher. and In-Betweener.  We could make a meal of this item. The pork is almost creamy and the kimchi is nicely handled! Tot O' The Day -  a creamy crusty ball of potato love.  He had a pork burger? with bacon? and cheese? what's not to love, something about the way his eyes rolled back in his head told me it was a culinary win! and finally..............Duck on cassoulet. Scrumptious.  Took the advice of my server to add the Foie Gras.  Oh My.  My Oh My. Yes.  Service was attentive, not pretentious, friendly, helpful - these people love their menu and We Do Too.  EAT LOCAL!  DRINK OLD SKOOL COCKTAILS!",

It has the laid back vibe of a BBQ joint, but with a dash of class. :)  It was my first time there and unfortunately I had already eaten dinner.    Although I had already eaten I was not too shy to pick off of a friends plate. He had some sort of pork shank with mashed potatoes and kale, the kale was amazeballs!!!  I tried a bite of the snapper and just before I say something, I don't really care for fish.  The snapper wasn't fishy and had a lot of great flavor.  For those who don't typically eat fish let me warn you....it still had a head....like, with eyes and lips. :-o (similar to that.)  The bartender just so happened to also be....one of the owners. :)  He was very knowledgeable when it came to wine, mixing drinks, whiskey, bourbon...truthfully, I think he just knows his alcohol.  He was really friendly and chatty, but not too chatty. ;)  He made my friends a few mixed drinks recommended by him, they loved them all.  I stuck with the wine because I know I enjoy that stuff every time.   Overall, it was a great experience it's too close to my house to not go back for a nice happy hour.  I recommend if you haven't been to at least try it out for some drinks and munchies.",

Considering they weren't that busy on the night we went, I was completely put off by the behavior.   The food, which we thought would be flavorful, was outright bland. Considering that the majority of the reviews for this place are great, this was thoroughly disappointing. The great smell from the meat in the kitchen did not match what I tasted in the apps nor the entrees.   I will not be coming back.",

I feel like so many restaurants are attempting to go for that, \"simple industrial,\" look these days and Pig & Pickle has really pulled it off well. They've created such a cool and trendy atmosphere with a menu that goes along with it.   There are so many unique foods to choose from on the menu and from my understanding, the menu changes frequently (which I love, personally). If it's available during the time you're there, I definitely recommend the udon noodles, bone marrow, foie gras, and roasted corn. Share amongst your table! The portions aren't big, but they're packed with flavor! (And definitely balanced, like the mission statement claims.)   Their drink menu is a total win too! I've never ordered anything I didn't like. For those that don't/can't drink alcohol, THEY HAVE COCA LIGHT. OMG LIKE WHAT?!?! and an array of really great soda pops. For those that choose an alcoholic beverage, their menu is endless and amazing! #scottsdaleproblems is my go to, but you really can't go wrong with any of the drinks they offer!   As far a price point, a little pricey, but definitely a stand out in the sea of Scottsdale restaurants! Go here!",

    "text": "Got take out here tonight for my roommate and I. I've eaten here before and everything was alright, not worth the hype or the price, but good enough for me to go again. As a bartender, I don't and have never left a review for any restaurant or bar ever, but this time was worthy of a first. The bartender when I called to place my order was definitely less than friendly to start. He quoted me 15/20 minutes which is the window in which I arrived. I did, surprisingly, get a quick smile upon realizing I was the take out customer. Other than that, he was totally cold, but whatever, I was in and out. I got home and we both realized first that the fries with our meal were mostly hard as a rock as if they had been sitting under the heat lamp for hours. Even if you could chew through a few, they tasted old. My roommate's brie sandwich was delicious. All I ordered was a regular burger which I was charged $12 for instead of $9. I also was charged 50 per meal for take out. Really guys? The bun of my burger was as rock hard as the fries and the entire meal was (no exaggeration) a task to eat. Not to mention, it really didn't taste that great. All around, I feel like I was overcharged and wasted my money on inedible food that's sitting in my trash can. I've heard the background of this place and used to respect it, but out of the 10/12 employees working with maybe 3 people at the bar and 5/6 tables, nobody could be attentive enough to put out some decent food or even kind? Pretentious restaurants are popping up everywhere and some people enjoy that, but mostly people just want good food and good service, none of which were apparent today. Bummer too, because I make a point to support local businesses.",

I know the fish isn't meant to be that strong a flavor but you're meant to taste something right? - White wine that came out tepid and once cheap wine gets warm it's undrinkable.   You get the idea.

You pull in to a random strip mall (standard for Scottsdale) and take a step into another world. And it's a tasty world for sure! The tostadas were my favorite. Piled high with shredded pork shoulder and married with fresh slaw and mint....these were, in a word....phenom!  For a nice Jewish girl, I'm actually a bit of an expert on pork shoulder and this was really great.  We also had pork belly...which tasted like a porky fois gras on top of seared pineapple.   The shrimp and grits were good, but not amazing. Im not going to lie, I'm from the south and I can be overly particular when it comes to these two items.   Our service was fab, the atmosphere was hip and dim and there was even a football game on. If they had been playing reggae music all night it would have been five star....oh wait...they WERE playing reggae all night. (And good stuff like Natural Mystic, not just Buffalo Soldier courtesy reggae!)  P and P...I will be back!",

The first time we came we sat outside and we ordered the tostadas to start which I honestly wasn't a big fan of. I think tostadas are my least favorite Mexican dish so maybe that's why but I think that there are better looking apps on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying. We also tried a tot (can't remember what kind it was that night) but that was the bomb and they're only a $1 which is a deal and just a fun thing to try. Then we split the trip tip steak which I didn't like. It was way too salty which is seriously weird coming from me because I LOVE salt. However, the blue cheese fondue that was on it was reallllly good. I personally wouldn't order that steak again. Our waiter recommended we get a slice of key lime pie and claimed it was the best he had ever had (my boyfriend wasn't convinced) so we tried a slice. It seriously was the best we'd ever had. Sooooooo SO good. I would order that again anytime. I also tried the Salty Dog drink (grapefruit juice and vodka and sea salts) and I wasn't impressed. The salt like was too hard to come off of the glass so you didn't really get any of it when you took a sip. The second time we came I got the mussels with chorizo and those were really good and I'd definitely order them again. The service is really good here and the staff is friendly so that's a huge plus. I am looking forward to trying different things on the menu as well as trying the brunch!",

To be fair, I visited twice before writing a review. 1st visit was great; waiter was super friendly, attentive and helpful. With 5 of us in our party, we had plenty to sample and all was delish (pot roast sandwich, rock shrimp salad, pork belly, mussels etc). Fast forward to last night and this is where it goes from 4.5 stars to 3. I think this place has a case of identity crises. They need to figure out who they are, what they do well, and stick with it. As opposed to my first visit, last night's was disappointing: a frazzled somewhat disinterested waitress (even though the place was practically empty) as well as complete inconsistency in the food had me come to the decision that I am done with P & P for awhile. Food was barely warm, flavors were uninteresting, and all the shredded \"meats\" tasted the same with a somewhat mushy texture. I made the mistake of ordering the seared tuna and noodle salad. The tuna was cooked as opposed to seared and the dressing was flavorless. My mother and I both ordered the diver scallops in creamed corn \"drizzled\" in some sort of chili oil. My scallops, as an appetizer, had a ratio of chili oil completely different than my mother's (her scallops were swimming in chili oil). Again--consistency is a problem. In addition, I have decided that I don't care for the ambience of this place. I find it cold, sparse and somewhat of an afterthought. I couldn't help but notice that the laminate surface of a few of the tables is already peeling or breaking off around the corners. Yes, I am picky, but after receiving  $135 bill for 4 at happy hour and one drink per person, I think I have the right to be. Bottom-line: meh. I can live without this place. There are too many great places in Scottsdale to eat to settle for meh.",

Most of the staff hang out by the front of the kitchen chatting which isn't neccesarily bad, but when you are there with family it was hard to hear our conversation over the boisterous wait staff. Our food was ok at best. I had the ratatouille, which had potential...but was so over salted it was like eating spoonfuls of salt from the mortons container.  My daughter had the shrimp with grits, sauce and grits were good, but the shrimp was way over cooked and rubbery. Other daughter had hanger steak which was absolutely fantastic. Staff didn't seem to care that food wasn't satisfactory. Never saw a manager after telling server about the problems. Left 80% of my food uneaten....it was that bad. Won't be going back.",

But I remember the food ..& this place is great! The server was great, in the midst of our convo...you could tell he enjoyed who he worked for,  & knew the food! We chatted a lot about the food. I can't recall what we exactly  ordereded..but. We had the bone marrow appetizer. It tasted  like bone marrow.  We had a pork roll swhich on the  house made bread roll. Everything about it was soooo good with the balanced slather of mustard &  house made pickles...& the pork juices.  Nomnomnom. I had the mussels..in a white wine broth with house made chorizo! Oh the best chorizo we both ever had! Delicious paired with the mussels & my crusty bread to dip in all the lovely juices of the them both swimming together in my bowl. To top it off..the desert. Oh so memorable... the toasted butter browned carrot cake with fried sweet yam shavings , carmalized pecans, with a black pepper berry drizzled over it & yes..  a whipped cream goat cheese! Oh what a way to end a fabulous meal. Hubby & I absolutely loved that dessert..the food, the service. We again wish this establishment was in our state & near our neighborhood so we could support it... awwww. Shame it is hundreds of miles away.",

Just don't ask for any substitutions, you won't get any even if the waiter says they can do it, that left a sour taste in my mouth.  Has potential to easily improve if they can get the kitchen to be able to read a ticket properly or for the waiter to be able to convey your request to the kitchen.  Good selection of beer, wine and booze.  If this place were located in old town Scottsdale it could potentially be the talk of the town however it is located in your typical neighborhood strip mall, which probably allows them to keep prices low and remain off of everyones radar..",

He is extremely knowledgeable about this menu and he truly likes his job and it shows. His suggestions were spot on. We tried the pickles \"things\" which had beets,eggs, kimchi, cauliflower,pickles and carrots. Their take on tater tots is awesome, too. It changes daily, too. Ours had pepperoni and mozzarella inside and served with a spicy aioli. I had the pork shoulder tostada and my only complaint would be the ginger aioli, plus ginger in the kimchi and my Moscow mule on top of it was a bit of ginger overload but that was my fault for not realizing how much ginger stuff I had actually ordered. My friend ordered the Croque Madame with a duck egg. It wasn't the best I've had but quite delicious nonetheless. The owner stopped by and said Hi which was so cool. I've been in this biz a long time and it's the little things like that that will make this place a success. Cheers P&P....see ya soon!",

My email response only said, \"talk to Cat.\" Called, and the person that answered the phone didn't know who Cat was.  Can we have have seating for 16? We got 12. The server came to our table once in a GREAT while.. I was very polite, and they were \"busy.\" I understand large groups and how it can be horrible sometimes, but this girl didn't even try.  I guess they just had a review in the newspaper so it brought a lot of people in. I have been a bartender. I have been a server. Why did you hire people that don't have personality, or the ability? On to the beer... They were out of Bud Light, Coors light, and two different bottles of wine that we tried to order. ( Side note, we do like good beer: they had an ok beer selection...but the stout I ordered was a horrible 3/4 pour.)We ordered the bone marrow as an appetizer...ehhh. My choice was the \"Nancy\" sandwich and it  was dry...even though it had avocado (which turned out to be guacamole), tomato, and two slices of brie (that were hamburger sized)...whats going on with your food cost on a pound of bri on my sandwich!? My husband had the mussels with chorizo,.. the mussels were just ok, and chorizo was like beef jerky. One friend said the roast beef sammie was ok, but really fatty.Another friend had a pork appetizer that  tasted like a salt lick for deer. We did have a friend that liked the burger and another that like some kind of ham and eggs dish.  No one had silverware. After we asked the server 3 times, SOME people had something to eat with. Three different people were overcharged in our group...which the server was very nice about correcting.  I wanted to like this place. We live in the neighborhood, and it has a charming name!  I couldn't say one nice thing about our experience here.",

I'd have to say that the Pig and Pickle really delivered, especially for this being their opening weekend. The food had a nice honesty to it, the price was affordable and the service was good. There wasn't much negative to say about the experience, other than quibbling over minor details and lack of bread with charcuterie. I look forward to return visits, and I'm eager to watch the restaurant and chefs earn some well-deserved buzz in the near future.",

The entire staff was so kind to my baby nephew who had a few crying bouts. The staff came out with a bowl of ice cream to help calm him down and even gave him a piece of bacon on the way out.

Ordered Shrimp & Grits w/Chorizzo--imagined a creamy plate of grits with shrimp and a dots of ground chorizo. Instead, was presented with a deep bowl of red-sauce drowning the grits (could barely see the grits) 5 large shrimp dotted the top with wafer thin slices of burned sausage. The sausage was so badly charred and bitter, I chewed, but couldn't swallow--left it buried in my napkin. The shrimp was okay, but not worth the price of the entree'.  I was dining alone; after delivering my bowl of drowning grits, the waiter never stopped by again to inquire on my satisfaction; no refills on my glass; had to flag him down for the bill. $24.00 later (for entree' and one glass of iced tea), I walked out thinking well, you don't have to go back. P.S. -- the fan in the restroom hasn't changed--it's still caked with dust and dirt.",

    "text": "Wife and I drove up from Tucson to visit a friend. Being we had time to kill and hungry we decided to try something new. Pig and Pickle came up and had great reviews so we decided to give it a shot.  Pulled into the strip mall it's located in and walked in. We were promptly greeted and seated by the hostess, she had a pleasant attitude but the clothes she wore reminded me of a Marilyn Manson video which didn't fit the ambiance of the restaurant.    Waters came to our table quick while we perused the lunch menu. Offerings seemed hifalutin, and a little on the high side for what you get. Read the menu thoroughly and the only thing that sounded good was the P & P Club, so my wife and I ordered one a piece and upgraded to the tots, the bartender/server highly recommended, so we took her advice.   Food came out in a decent amount of time. First glance the presentation was nice. So here goes nothing,  picked up a half of the sandwhich and took a bite, had a fishy taste but none the less ok at best. On to the tots, which I really looked forward to. Took a bite and I went from excited to extremely disappointed, they were extremely bland, tasted like breaded fried mashed potatoes. Ok next thing on the plate was the pickle, the place has pickle in their name so I thought it would be a no brainer and would be the best part of the meal and again was disappointed,  tasted like a under fermented pickle dunked in Apple cider vinegar,  not impressed at all.    We had to wait a bit for our check due to our server tending bar as well. All in all it has a nice interior and is capable of a lot.  But in the end we were highly disappointed at the food we received,  especially for the prices they are asking. If you should go I highly recommend you ask for an onion sandwich with their bread because out of the whole meal those were the 2 best ingredients in our meals. Needless to say we came, we saw, we left disappointed.",

    "text": "A friend of mine already knew about this place but forgot about it until he found it on Yelp. 3 of us made it near the end of their happy hour and I was in the mood to try something new. Personally, I'm a fan of wheat beers and decided to try the Konig Ludwig Weiss, I absolutely loved this beer and will return just for the beer as I don't know anywhere else in the area that carries it.  I ordered the pork tostadas as an appetizer. I wish the server told me how large the portions were because they were huge and I wasn't hungry from the dinner I had ordered. This appetizer was great and on the Happy Hour Menu. For dinner I got duck over some berries and mustard seeds. Normally I'm not a fan of mustard but I really enjoyed this aspect of the meal. The duck was eh-ok. The portion size of the duck wasn't that much considering it costs about $15 and it was a bit too well done for my liking.  The service was ok. Everyone was really nice but I felt as if the waitress was a bit new so I gave her some leeway. Overall, I enjoyed the place. If you don't come during happy hour your bill with 1 drink will probably be about $25 plus per person. I'll be back for the beer and appetizers.",

I ordered a Sriracha drink that was more sour than anything and a pork porchetta that I just could not swallow.  We did have some Brussels that were really tasty.  My sister had a sandwich that the juice so soaked her bread that her bread turned to liquid on the bottom.  I generally do not give low marks on unusual food but this was over-the-top awful.  The waitress appeared to be accommodating and then I overheard her mocking us to the cook when all my sister had asked for was some bread that was not total mush. The manager never checked on us or why we were unhappy and they did not even offer to make anything right.  I would never return to this restaurant again and as you can see from my previous reviews, I am not generally very critical.  If the restaurant service had been more interested in customer service, I may have been willing to go back and try some different items based on so many great reviews but will not be back.",

We received our soups first and the clam chowder was only luke warm but the flavoring was great. Then they brought out our appetizer brussel sprouts and WOW... It was the best brussel sprouts I've ever had. My duck was mediocre but the steak bavette my sister got was really good. This is a great place to dine in and good atmosphere. I will be returning soon!  *must try the Brussel sprouts*",

    "text": "Had our last dinner of the night before we left Arizona the next day. Boyfriend came across this cute place called \"Pig & Pickles\". We came on a Monday night of Memorial Day, assuming that everyone has work the next day, this place was pretty empty around 9pm.   We did not know they were part of the Arizona Restaurant week, so we were curious of what they had for it. After overlooking menu, it was $30 per person for 3 course, so we each decided to get it and share.  First Course: + roasted bone marrow+green garlic & spring onion compote  Two bone marrows were served under green garlic spring onions and a side of sliced bread. Delicious when you scoop some marrow onto the bread then add a bit of the green garlic spring onion and yum  +mushroom crostini+pistachio pesto Mushroom crostini in pistachio pesto was served on top of two sliced toast. Mushrooms well sauteed and the flavors were good.  Second Course:  + the dump truck' - mixed lettuces, shaved veggies, seeds, cucumber and shallot vinaigrette  Loved how the dressing was light and everything was fresh.  +wedge salad - bacon, egg, cucumber, tomato, radish and buttermilk bleu cheese Not a bleu cheese person, however, boyfriend enjoyed it. You can request to put the dressing on the side. Crunchy wedges!  Third Course: crispy skin chicken - bacony red potatoes, creamed leaks, arugula Chicken was flavorful and very crispy. You just need to take a small piece of the chicken and eat it with the potatoe, creamed leaks and arugula.  + pork porchetta - roasted pork belly, homemade sausage, creamed corn, heirloom tomato & arugula Heaven in your mouth! A thick slice of pork belly wrapped around homemade sausage and served with creamed corn? The combination was just perfection. This is a must get if you love pork belly.   Overall, we loved our meals and sure did get full off of it. The meals were big and we were informed that we can purchase one restaurant of the week and share among two people, so it'll save you some bucks.",

I ordered a Cuban-Esque sandwich but it has SO much horseradish or hot mustard that upon the first bite my tastebuds and sinuses were kaput. It was overwhelming.  I hate sending food back - makes me nervous so instead I just didn't eat. The server never noticed my entire sandwich sitting there untouched either.   We did order desserts. I had a bite of bread pudding and carrot cake. They were phenomenal.   I just can't rate higher with such a flop on my main dish. Maybe next time!",

Since I'm a vegetarian I have to put the disclaimer out that it isn't your most friendly spot for the non meat eater. However, they do have an absolutely amazing vegetarian polenta pie. I mean this dish is seriously wonderful. The polenta is creamy and the baked vegetables are perfect with raisins added for a surprising sweetness. The shrimp and grits are equally fantastic if you partake in seafood and the meat dishes all sounded creative.   Don't be taken aback by the unexpected location, pig and pickle is a must try. Next time I plan on trying a dessert. The four stars is mostly due to that not all dishes are created equal and you may be more satisfied with one than another. Our service was very good except that it took longer than I'd prefer after our meal to receive the check. I have to be nit picky for my five stars.",

We were informed by our waiter that the chef cooks what he wants, how he wants and does not customize orders. This was in response to asking if there were any other salad dressing options other than shallot vinaigrette.  In other words, no, there are no other options. The pork burger is also filled with ground onions. Being a True onion hater, this was disappointing.   We both ended up sharing the Brussel sprout starter and each had a burger. I enjoyed the Brussels sprouts but my husband found them too dry. The unusual addition of egg on top helped with the dryness.   Both of our burgers came out overcooked to well done. The outside is a very crunchy charbroil. There wasn't much flavor but the quality of the meat was high. The burger as well as the meat were both dry and disappointing. My husband did not enjoy his shallot vinaigrette dressed salad, finding it too bitter for his preference. I had the fries which are cooked in vinegar. This added a nice flavor to them.   Unfortunately the menu was too limited for us. We recognized the quality of the food but the flavors just weren't there. Service was adequate, nothing more.",

The best part of our experience was that they were open late, not a lot of good food joints open late in the South West!    I ordered the shrimp and grits but the grits came out cold, they made me a new one and threw in a free dessert.  The ground pork burger (can't remember the name of it) was outstanding, everything about it was super yum!  Definitely will return :)",

It's almost like you get a present when the menu changes.. i like presents :-)   The Mississippi mud pie chocolate,  oh my goodness its so chocolate, is really good these days too.... although, that carrot cake? mmmmmm....

I always also enjoy the music playing ever so faintly in the background,  Tribe Called Quest, some Heiro, some Wu, some Bob, Blackalicious, Diagble Planets, J5, sometimes there's live music....

    "text": "Update: If you want insight into how this place operates, look at the sardonic, unapologetic, and passive aggressive responses the owner gives to ratings he deems unfair (basically all the one or two star ratings). Why would you want to spend money at a place that doesn't care whether you enjoyed yourself?   Review:  My boyfriend and I live a few miles down the road and we are always looking for places to eat that are a bike ride away. The Pig & Pickle has been on our list of places to try for awhile, so we decided to drop in tonight. While my boyfriend was locking up our bikes, I grabbed a table. Water was put on the table right away and a server came right over to take my drink order. I told her I wanted to wait until my boyfriend sat down and to please come back in a minute or two. About a minute later, my boyfriend came in. It took another ten minutes for someone to finally remember to stop by and take our drink orders. Before we gave the server our drink orders, I asked him if I could swap the Swiss cheese on the Cuban sandwich for cheddar or provolone (I HATE Swiss cheese--I know some people love it, but in my opinion, the smell and taste completely detracts from whatever I'm trying to eat). I made sure to ask before we ordered anything because I saw (in very small print) that substitution requests would be ignored, which I found a little strange. The server looked really stressed when I made the request and said he would have to ask the kitchen. When I glanced over at the open kitchen, there were two guys doing nothing--one was even on his phone. Anyway, when the server came back, he told me they would be happy to take the cheese off, but I would not be permitted to have any other cheese on the sandwich. You'd think for a $14 sandwich, you could have whatever kind of cheese you want (with the exception of goat cheese, of course), especially since the substitution is an easy swap and they weren't busy. I guess they really meant it when they said all substitutions would be ignored. Consequently, my boyfriend and I were pretty annoyed. When a restaurant won't honor substitution requests of any kind, they better be world renowned or a Zagat rated five-stars. Otherwise, I'm just going to assume they are lazy or pretentious weirdos, who think they know better than the customer. Consequently, we left and went down the street to the Mexican restaurant, The Blind Pig. I ended up having a delicious, authentic Cuban sandwich, made according to my preferences, all for only $10! Extremely serendipitous!! Obviously, we won't be returning to the Pig & Pickle.",

I had the farmers scramble which was very large and delicious. It came with an everything bagel, creamy scrambled eggs, lots of large wild mushrooms, tomato, kale & cheese. I usually never like scrambled eggs but this were exceptional. I also had a side of bacon which also was large and so good, delicious perfectly cooked crispy but not over-cooked bacon; just like it should be.  My husband had the fried Brussel sprouts with a side of pork belly and he loved it. It was so large and filling he brought some home for later that day. I tried some of his pork belly and again it was perfectly cooked and delicious. They have a great selection of craft beers. I had a vanilla stout and my husband a tripel ale both very good. Before leaving we stopped in their new provisions shop which has an array of take home items from cheeses, steaks, homemade sausages and smoked meats. We took home a pork asiago sausage and an andouille sausage and both were so tasty and had the with the right amount of herbs and spices we wished we had purchased more than having one each, We will definitely return.",

There was a crowd of people and live music! Yay, live music. We sat down right away and the server wasn't that friendly, but didn't mind. I ordered the funktional drink and it was really strong. I guess it would be a really good drink if you are out with friends, talking the night away because this one drink can totally get you \"happy\".   We ordered the pork belly, the fried brussel sprouts, and the stuffed tater tots. All were very tasty.

The alcoholic drinks though, I would come back for especially if I want to forget my problems.",

We were promptly seated by the overdressed hostess and offered menus and water. Thomas greeted us shortly after to offer drinks.   For food we got a charcuterie plate and a side salad to start.  Since it was happy hour, the salad was upgraded to a Dump Truck Salad. For the charcuterie meats it had: chorizo, salami, pork belly terrine, smoked salmon and tazzo ham. For pickled veggies: okra, green beans, pickles, grapes, onions and eggs.  It also had house made: mustard, bacon jam, sourdough bread (not very sour) , apricot spread and butter. The plate was outstanding, with kudos to the pork belly terrine plus the pickles.   For entrees, we ordered 'The Nancy', a cheddar bacon burger, a bowl of Mussels and the Shrimp and Grits. Everyone raved about their meal. For me, the shrimp were good, plus it had lots of chorizo slices and the grits were killer. Cheesy, thick, buttery, good spice and a flavorful broth. I'd order it again in a heartbeat. All in all, along with Thomas's excellent service, a perfect meal.",

The triple threat of being open late, having delicious food/beer and having a live DJ playing that boom bap is a combo I dare you to find elsewhere in this area.  I highly recommend the gin and guice cocktail and the buffalo pork shanks. They have an extensive list of craft beer as well. The service is good and the entire place is clean, well lit and full of quirky pig themed art. The prices are reasonable and the environment is relaxed and unique. Next time I visit the area this place will be the first stop.",

    "text": "Sadly My wife and I had very high expectations for the Pig & Pickle.   Having just landed in town for a weekend getaway we came here straight from the airport (based on a lot of positive reviews here).   I wanted a beer and good food after a long travel day.   I asked our server Jake if all the beers were served by the pint.   He replied yes and I ordered the stout.   He came back a few minutes later and informed me they were out and asked if I'd like to order something else.   I reviewed the menu and settled on the blueberry sour.   Jake returned with the beer in a snifter (probably 10-12 Oz).   I reminded Jake that he had told me a few minutes earlier that all beer on tap was served by the pint, and his response was rude at best.   He told me that the sour wasn't, and didn't offer me another option.   I protested, and he offered a pint of the beer I ordered.   What happened next was almost unbelievable...  He took my glass and returned with same beer I just ordered just poured in a pint glass (not topped off)!   What a joke.   Either he intentionally messed with me by retuning with a partially filled glass, or a manager told him to serve it to me that way.   This one star review is based on principle.   This is not how you treat customers.   You either give me a pint, offer an alternate, or at best just tell me you made a mistake and apologize.   I wish the food situation was better but it was it was over all pretty disappointing.   We started with the Dump Truck salad.   Not recommended.   Bland at best, with a non-existent dressing.  We followed with the Buffalo pork Shanks, which were served at a tepid temp.   I thought the taste was pretty good but it was clearly not cooked to order.   Lastly we finished with the Fried chicken pot pie.   It was really good, and could have raised this from a bad to mediocre review.   But the beer thing left such a bad taste in my mouth I can't provide a better rating, and would never recommend this place to anybody.   Sad.",

We arrived for happy hour, but really wanted a real menu. HH food was lack luster:  Mac and cheese wasn't dreamy creamy excellence, it was dried up pasta with some cheese and toppings.  Salad was a little better than ok. I tried the marrow bones and while good, could have used something more on the plate to help cut the rich fattiness of the dish The beer could have been colder, but now I'm whining. Service was good, but I'm sorry, we won't be back.",

A few of my repetitive favorites include the golden beet salad topped with pork belly, bone marrow, charcuterie board, pork belly appetizer, pork belly entree, foie gras, the Brussels sprouts with a fried egg and pork belly....and, wait, did I say pork belly? The meats and pickled foods on the charcuterie board are made in-house, as well as the breads.   The menu changes seasonally, so I can't wait to see what will appear next!  They also have a nice selection of craft drinks and beer to choose from. I usually go for something local and/or of the IPA variety.   The staff is friendly and efficient. I thought the price for every meal eaten here was reasonable. As far as gastropubs go, Pig & Pickle is my #1.",

I thought it was funny and really has nothing to do with my rating.   Decent selection of beer on tap, I had a delicious IPA.  I ordered a burger with a fancy name & aioli mayo or some bullshit like that but it was basically a patty with bacon on top. It wasn't good at all, I only took a few bites but what I did eat sat in my stomach and made me feel gross all day.  The service never really got better but there was a speedy and fun glam guy working the patio that made me wish we would have moved out there once my buddy arrived.    I've wanted to give them another try but I associate the place with the gross feeling now and can't force myself to go back.",

    "text": "Me and Mr. T came here last night. We inadvertently made it in time for happy hour since our movie at Camelview was sold out. I was impressed they have happy hour on Saturdays, but the pricing was less so. A dollar off wine by the glass (5 to choose from), well drinks, sandwiches, and apps.  Nothing on their \"old school\" cocktail list called out to me (which is extremely unusual), so I got a greyhound. It was delicious with fresh-squeezed ruby red grapefruit. My husband went with their ultra smooth mai tai. I'm not sure if it was smooth because it was blended well or just light with the booze.  We got the $4 plate of pickles. I figured these had to be good given the name of the restaurant. There were several varieties on the plate including grapes (yum!), spicy dill, bread and butter, fennel, sunomono, and watermelon rind (the highlight of our entire meal).  The vegan burger had a nice flavor, but it fell apart with the first bite and continued to do so as I ate it. The burger chunks were good with the dump truck salad though. Perhaps P&P needs to bite the bullet and just do this as a vegetarian burger with eggs added so that it binds properly. My husband thought his beef sandwich was just ok. I tried not to steal too many fries off his plate. Those were delicious and definitely not frozen.  Overall, it was an all right experience. We wouldn't come back here on our own, but we wouldn't say no if someone suggested P&P either.",

I'm a big fan of charcuterie and this looked like a great spot.     We arrived and being it was pretty early the dining room was pretty empty at this point but we expected this.  The place has a cool feel to it.  Bar to the left with bar seating and a few high top tables and a larger dining room to the right  where you can see into the kitchen.  They have a pretty killer happy hour menu.  We got the dump truck salad and the char plate for 5 bucks a piece which is probably the best deal in town.  Not only was it a great deal the food tasted amazing.  That would normally be enough to eat but since we were here to eat we ate.  My Wife ordered the scallop dish and I ordered the braised pork belly with apple butter and the roasted bone marrow.  Everything was absolutely amazing.  The service was spot on and delightful making our experience here fantastic.  Thanks Pig & Pickle!",

Most of the other choices had ingredients I don't care for.  Went there for lunch. I had the Cuban sandwich my wife had the Croque madame. They were very good although the Ciabatta bread on the Cuban didn't hold up the the sandwich. It fell apart. They do give you a good sized portion. I think prices could be lowered and portion sizes reduced as neither one of us could finish our meal.  The service was not very good. Waited a long time for the waiter to come by, he only came by one time during our meal, we could have used refills on our drinks. We were finished and waited a long time for him to get our check. Another table had the same experience with the same waiter. Unfortunately, he was the only server working at this time. There were only 4 tables for him to cover.  We won't go back as there is just not enough on the menu I like.",

    "text": "Not a very big place, a dozen regular height tables and about a half dozen high tops. The menu has a blurb at the top which talks about balance.  Balance between sweet and sour, old and new, etc.  I suppose you could almost call this a mission statement because it was evident in each thing I ate.   Here's a nice touch - the hostess dropped off the menu and then came right back with a glass of water.  New one on me but a nice touch.  The waiter appeared a couple of minutes later to take a drink order and instead I asked him for his recommendations from the menu.  He described their duck breast entree in such a way that my mouth was already watering - sold!  While he was talking, I noticed the couple at the next table receive their slices of pie and asked about their dessert offerings.  They must have overheard the conversation because they both gave me a big thumbs-up when he described the process of making the pie the gentleman was eating.    The duck beast served somewhere between medium and medium rare.  I was sliced into about 6 pieces of an even thickness and served over a mixture which included wild rice, spinach, dried cherries, feta cheese, almonds and a mesquite syrup.  When I saw it on the menu it looked like it was a dish that might have too much going on to be enjoyable.  When it arrived in front of me I figured my inkling was confirmed.  I was dead wrong!  The varying tastes and textures absolutely worked together.  Just as mentioned at the top of the menu, this dish was all about balance.  The duck was crispy, salty and tender all at once.  The rice brought another layer of texture while the dried cherries added a certain tang and the mesquite syrup contributed smokiness.  The feta added creaminess and was balanced with the slivered almonds.  Wow!    I have never in my life heard of vinegared strawberry pie.  Apparently, this is an old technique which involves cooking the strawberries well ahead of pie baking and then mixing them into the pie.  There was more to the story which I just can't remember.  What I do remember is the pie.  This really was the most unusual strawberry pie I've ever been served but it was delicious!  The pie itself was filled with a gelatin-based mixture which included the vinegared strawberries in syrup form and a sugary top crust.  Over the top of the pie was a strawberry compote and they finished the dish with creme fraiche.  The first draft had an espresso syrup on the plate but the waiter very graciously removed it when I told him I disliked coffee flavors.  This pie reminded me of eating strawberry shortcake in terms of flavors but not texture.  The texture reminded me of eating pecan pie but without the pecans.  Balance...  Side note: I very much appreciate the recommendations for this place that I received after posting to the Phoenix Yelp talk board.  I probably would not have found this place on my own but I am really glad to have had the experience of dining here on this trip.",

The Pig & Pickle just opened, serving up a pork-heavy dinner menu paired with a variety of beers and handcrafted cocktails. While the interior gives off a sports bar vibe with an open kitchen, the menu features local ingredients in comfort food style dishes that give the place a warm, welcoming feel.  I had a really great vegan burger ($8), made with beans, grains and seeds. It was tasty and filling, and I really enjoyed the seasoned fries that came with it.  My friend got the creamy broccoli and and brown ale with cheddar soup ($7), which he said was great, as well as a pot roast sammie ($10), with carmelized onions, havarti and chile aioli. It looked like a hearty sandwich, and he said it really tasted fresh.  I'd go back to the Pig & Pickle to try their mac n' cheese -- and I'm also curious how their appetizer of pickles would stand out. The spot is also cool because it serves food until 1 a.m., which is great for Old Town Scottsdale nightclubbers who want a foodie fix.",

    "text": "took the family out to P&P for New Year's Eve lunch - 8 of us and every one was very happy with their meals - including a vegetarian and two gluten-intolerants. the Veg had the fried brussels sprouts and a beet salad and swooned - also a Maggie margarita that was excellent; Glutens had breakfast (raved about the pork belly & potatoes), and beet salad + order of bacon, and they must lose money on the bacon; easily 7-8 slices of excellent quality pig sides.  Sis had the 'Cuban Pickle Crisis' - a superb Cubano sandwich, and hubby had the P&P club - both raved about the quality and the size of the meals.  Niece had 'Apocalypse Sow', I had a bite and it is excellent.  I had a patty melt, I'm a sucker for home-made rye, and ordered it medium-rare, but got it well done.  It's hard to get a burger properly cooked medium-rare here in the Valley, but I expected better here; the quality of the Naiman Ranch beef was good, but,,,,,,,,,,,, come on guys. PS  - Our server, a grey-haired rail of a happy smiling man, was very good and not intrusive - it was easy to tell when we were all laughing out loud that he should wait a minute to ask how we're doing - we're doing just fine. All-in-all  it was a very good dining experience, and I will go back.",

One of my favorite drinks was Pimmin aint Easy, although I think it has since changed to another name with a slightly different recipe.  The things that always stick out whenever I tell people to go to Pig & Pickle are Tater Tots. You always have to try the tots. They change them everyday and I am always so pleasantly surprised by the amazing flavor that gets packed into those. The other item is only on the late night menu and that is the Duck Fat Fries. I was super hesitant to try them but I am very glad I did. My only warning that if you are tempted to get the pickled plate it is VERY INTENSE. Something that I recommend sharing with a large group. It is good, but lots of pickled items.   The food is worth trying, don't allow the description of the food frighten you. The chef's blend of flavors has not disappointed.",

He stopped by our table every 20 minutes just to refill the water and barely even talked to us. When it came to ordering food I asked if the lamb sliders were good and he said they were his favorite. The lamb sliders came out and 50% of it was the bread so I took off the top bun and it was still disgusting. The duck fat fries were alright the fries were very hard.

The reason I give this place a 3/5 is from my last experience. Our waitress was very friendly, but the overall service was very sloppy, so much so that I had to write this review.  1) The hostess seemed careless in refilling our waters, nearly knocking our glasses over several times. Though I'm not a prude when it comes to fashion, her gothic, Stevie Nicks look was odd given the decor of the restaurant. It also looked and felt like she had some attitude.  2) I didn't get to start my actual meal until five minutes after it was delivered. The reason was I had to waive down the waitress for basic items associated with a brunch.   -- I had to waive her down for ketchup (I had eggs and potatoes on my plate, and anther person had potatoes.) -- I then had to wave down the waitress for salt (There is neither salt nor pepper on the tables.) -- I needed butter but did not ask for it simply because I was tired of waiving her down. The toast could have REALLY used it; being in the army though, I've had worse.   3) Finally, just plain inattentiveness was an issue. There were long breaks in between her visits. (The place was slowly becoming busy, around 11am). The table ordered a second round of cocktails and they did not arrive. I could have used a coffee refill during the meal but that offered AFTER she delivered our check.",

Hanger steak was great and cooked to a perfect medium rare. Great drink selection and if ordering dessert make sure to get the seared carrot cake. Mississippi mud pie was good too but carrot cake was GREAT.",

Had the tapas which were average, broccoli cheese soup which was more like potato soup and mussles and clams with chorizo in creme fraiche. The portion was large but odd juxtaposition of flavors was only initially interesting and half the serving was left on the table. Add one draft and one bottle of beer and the tab was over $60.

Well, we scored!  I should mention that we are traveling with our 5 year old with a nut allergy. The staff was incredible and accommodating and so knowledgeable about the menu. We arrived for the end of happy hour and ordered the tostadas with pork and kimchi and the dump truck salad. Both excellent. The salad was very seasonal with cauliflower, radish and cucumber, my 5 year old loved each bite. My son's burger was hand made with homemade bread.  After our apps we had the mussels with chorizo and homemade bread. When I asked the waitress if it was good she begged us to order it. It did not disappoint. We also had the pickles on the side which was not just house made pickles but a pickled egg, beans, okra, mushrooms, beets and even grapes, all distinctly different from each other. My only complaint was that there was a lot of fennel in each dish we had, so by the end of the meal we had a bit of fennel fatigue.  Would make a big effort to come back here again when in town. The staff was so attentive and knew so much about the drinks and dishes. We didn't drink this evening but the specialty drinks were as well thought out as the dishes. It was a pleasure just reading the menus.",

Appreciate that the menu always has new things to try, and every item we've ever had is great- such good flavor and unique combinations in each menu item. Try the tasso, and the pork carnitas! It's nice that they have some vegetarian options, too- the entire menu is a good variety, something for every (adult) palate!

The food was pretty good, we had  the hangar steak, and believe or not, the cook actually knew what \"Medium Rare\" meant. They also have bottled Coke from Mexico. The good ends there. After a loooooong look at the menu and wait for the server, and choosing the fish and chips (it was friday, after all) the server asked, \"You came to pig and pickle for fish and chips?\"  WHAT?  It's on the menu, so I cannot have it? He was a bit overbearing on suggestions, suggesting the Duck or Pork.  There was also too much \"we serve locally sourced food, natural, blah blah blah. I'm all for supporting local farmers, and healthy ingredients, but we felt a little too \"schooled.\" When we both chose the steak, We sort of were made to feel as if we made a stupid choice. The steak was very good, the meat had good flavor, but the portion of the sides was a bit small. You are gonna need a starter or a salad to get enough food. The dessert menu was carrot cake, chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. Too much of that. we went to Dairy Queen for Ice Cream after that. The odd menu changes every night too.  The prices were OK, but mixed drinks were $7-$10 and just plain weird.",

The sausage is cooked within the fondue and not something you dip into it. The Sow burger was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. Too much mayo based aoili. The second time we sat at the bar. They have some decent coctails, but a little over priced for what you get. After 2 cocktails for $20 I expect a buzz that didn't happen. Very weak pour. The bone marrow and pork belly were both excellent. The pork belly with pumpkin puree and pecans was amazing when you get a bite with all three at once. We would go back and sit in the bar area because of the food, but this isn't my first choice for drinks and the owners need to really re-evaluate their staff. They are all very off-putting.",

However, now that we have that out of the way, let's discuss what's really important here.. the food. The food is AMAZING. We began our meal with the pork belly appetizer. WOW.  Pork belly cooked to perfection, resting on top of mashed parsnips with an beautiful apple butter, with sliced apple, almonds, and frise. UNREAL. Was sad when the plate was licked clean, and there was no more. Moved next to the entrees. I had the duck leg, on the yam and faro risotto with blueberries gastric, while my fiance had the pot roast sandwich with havarti, onions, and an add on of more pork belly, and the mac and cheese tator tots. Let's start with mine..the duck. Absolute perfection on every level. The duck did not die in vain, I'll tell you that. Each bite better than the next, until my plate was empty, and my stomach was full. The pot roast sandwich was so enormous, and delicious, my fiance struggled to finish it... and lost the battle.. I've never ever seen this before. EVER. Incredibly sophisticated, yet completely approachable dishes, for no where near what you'd expect to pay for quality like this. Our hats off to the chefs.  These men know their meats, and what to pair with that perfectly cooked meat, to make your dinner an incredible experience. BRAVO Pig & Pickle. We will be back. at $65 for an appetizer, two entrees, and quite a few drinks, this was money very well spent. Oh, and I'd be remiss not to mention, our waiter was absolutely terrific. He was very knowledgeable about the menu, and super helpful helping us choose between the many options that had us stuck on which way to go.   Don't hesitate. Go. Enjoy.

Ordered the croquet sammie and a glass of vino. Asked for house wine and was informed that a pinot noir was the only option....so noir it was. I texted a friend and informed her I was at P n P and feel free to come over and have a drink/nibble. My friend arrived and was literally not acknowledged for 10 minutes. Scott was no where in site. There was a man who we later found out was one of the owners behind the bar...not friendly...not attentitive ...certainly not a reason to visit. Earlier when he asked how was my food I stated the food was good but the temp was lukewarm and I would prefer hotter.Clearly he was NOT interested in my feedback and opinions as he scurried off and remained aloof and unavailable. Scott returns and we share  our disappointment with him...he is gracious and apologetic.....we press on, When presenting our check the owner bartender informs us that he has given us the industry discount( awesome) until my friend realizes that she has been charged 12$ for whatshe hoped to be a cheap glass of house wine....much to our shegrin the noir was not . All in all here it is....nice location...nice ambiance, food was flavorful, Scott was a consumate pro, the prices food wise were reasonable...they need a more affordable wine selection for  the working class. I am sad ...I had high hopes. I was  not at all impressed with the surly arrogance of the \"owner bartender\" .He alone,was a deterrent to wanting to return regardless of the food and or drinks.

    "text": "Usually Yelp reviewers are pretty right on, but not in this case.  I give the one star for the nice waiter.  The food was awful and over priced.  The cod bites appetizer had 4 small (half dollar size) pieces of fish with about 20 soggy french fries.  The pork pot roast sammy had a nice burnt roll, that actually cut the roof of my mouth.  Very little meat in the sandwich and half of it was un-chewable fat.  The flavor of the inside onion, cheese and butter was good.  I ordered the tots for an additional $1.00 and you only get two small potato creations.  These were decent but not great.  I was surprised that the waiter did not mention anything when he took my plate with a pile of chewed up fat on it.  I think he sees the writing on the wall and didn't really give a hoot.  I would suggest he starts looking for a new job.  This place has been open for three weeks and I am positive that most of these reviews have been made by friends or family members.  I have lived in Scottsdale for over 40 years and have seen many places come and go.  This place will go.",

They put us in the back room which was awesome because we were all dressed up for a Rock n' Roll theme and we were quite the noisy bunch. Service was pretty good considering our large group, I was pleasantly surprised! And the food.... the pork shoulder was really good!!   My second time at P&P I shared a couple of items, the apocalypse sow and a burger the waiter created himself. Everything was delicious, but really heavy... you need to come very hungry! The waiter was interesting and all over the place. He was helpful in choosing drinks and food, but he wasn't your typical waiter.   Bottom Line: Come hungry, expect to leave stuffed with deliciousness, and don't be too frightened by the weird waiter!",

I have wanted to try this place since they opened since it's a mile from my house, boy am I glad I did and sorry I waited so long!   Since it was so nice out my girlfriend and I decided to sit on the patio. Our server came over and loved his dry sense of humor! We got a few recommendations on the cocktails which every ingredient is made FRESH!!! I had the Pineapple Express and she had the Tropical Itch. They were both awesome!  Our server told us about the Tots and they are made fresh and different daily! We each tried one (they are huge like meatballs). OMG AMAZING!!!!  She was going to get the Fish Fry and I was going to get the Littleneck Clams but he reccommeded we eat something they are known for since it was our first time. I agreed. I was looking at the Duck Breast and he said it was great so I decided on that and my girlfriend got another pork dish that was stuffed (can't remember the name). OMG my duck was outstanding! One of the best dishes I can say I've had in quite a long time! I'm still craving it!!!!!  This is a great spot for late night eats/drinks or dinner. The service was great as well as the food. I would suggest this place to anyone and can't wait to go back soon!!!",

The cocktails are some of the best around, with a great list and they are very well made; so I do recommend going for cocktails and a snack.  The service is hit or miss - we had an outstanding waitress our first trip but a sloth disguised in hipster guy's clothing our second.  Don't eat the pickles unless you also enjoy eating powdered alum, and be aware they like putting those pickles in a lot of their dishes. The \"tots\" are really hush puppies, and I don't like hush puppies...but I do love tots, so that was a disappointment.  The dump truck salad had greens, carrots, tomatoes and dressing and that was all.  That's fewer ingredients than a Costco salad, and certainly not worthy of the name \"dump truck\".  All the sandwiches and the quinoa salad I tried tasted flat, probably not seasoned correctly, though it was all cooked and plated perfectly.  Sorry, but I can't adequately describe the bad tasting food other than \"flat\".  I didn't finish anything but the broccoli soup which was not flat at all - that soup was very, very good.  But soup and cocktails aren't enough to draw me in again or recommend Pig & Pickle for anything more than drinks.",

    "text": "When it initially opened I gave it three stars.  It's been 4 or 5 stars since that time with a changing menu and great service.  Recently we had a group of eight dine there.  About half the people got sick.  It must have been one of the starter plates.  We had the salmon (one of our favorites), charcuterie and cheese plates. Nothing tasted off.   I'll still go there because the food, drinks and service are great, but I'm wondering who else got sick?",

    "text": "Ok I wanted to give this place more stars based on just looking at the menu, but either I may have ordered a couple of things that just didn't suit my fancy or it wasn't quite what I expected. Will be back to try again. Ordered the charcuterie plate which I thought would be meat, cheese, and bread, but no cheese was present.  I felt that this took away from the plate. There were two meats  that were good- but the rest unimpressive and due to strange textures of the meat, made me feel slightly ill. The pretzel bread and other breads were however delicious. Ordered the goat cheese with sour plums- lacked some flavor and once again the texture was unusual. Not bad, just not my favorite.  The pork burger was great- holy meat! Fries were delicious.  Restaurant was way too loud for my taste, until it got a little later in the evening. Servers were very attentive.",

    "text": "Food: Very good. We had the duck and the fish fry. Both were excellent. We were sorta disappointed that we didn't get any of the house made bread. I guess we should have asked? Could be our faults so whatever.  Drinks: Eh...I've had better old fashioneds. Maybe I am just comparing it too much to Boston gastropubs which tend to have fantastic drinks. This is not to say it was bad, it was good...but I wasn't obsessed with it the way I am at some other places. On the other hand my dining companion's drink was good and I would be satisfied with it at virtually any location.  Service: The hosts were super friendly. Our server was nice, but very pushy and not super subtle in his attempts to upsell us. Why would you ask if I want fois gras or pork belly with my fish? Who puts foie gras on fish? We were also interrupted in the middle of our entree when we were halfway through it to so that he could start trying to sell us on dessert. Can we just have a conversation? I understand that restaurants need to upsell given that I was a server at one point, but good restaurants find ways to do it at the right time and in subtle ways. This was our only meal in the Phoenix area so I have no idea whether that was the norm (I am guessing it is not). I guess the point is, I am sure the service could easily be improved upon by giving people a little more space and not making recommendations that make no sense in terms of taste combinations for the purpose of having me spend more money.  Overall though, I would come back if I lived in the area. You may be asking how I came up with four stars here given the amount of criticism...my answer would be that the food quality to price ratio is great. The same entrees in most northeastern cities would be at least 5 or so dollars more.",

Everything sounded so great and unique, but my mussels with chorizo just tasted burnt...I'm not even sure how you would burn something like that, but I digress. I can't even remember what my friend ordered, but again, it was something that appealed to our foodie sense on paper, but was nothing too special in actuality. Too bad...",

The table had the pork belly appetizer with the heirloom tomatoes and bib lettuce, as well as the foie gras. I had never had foie gras paired with strawberries, but it was an amazing compliment. But truly the best part of the meal was the service. We let them know in advance that we were bringing in a couple to celebrate a special occasion, and they went out of their way to make that couple feel special. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Awesome service.  The pork belly is so delicious, its ridiculous.  They make these tots with different ingredients everyday.  Ive had some with corned beef and cabbage, some with hot dogs and smoked gouda, and some other ones with like bleu cheese and bacon.  Best tater tots I have ever had.  They have an eclectic little stoner menu for late nights that is priced pretty well.  I suggest you smoke a j and head out here at like 11.  There is a patio outside and you can eat and smoke out there.  This place rocks.  Its definitely a cool kid spot.",

I loved that the kitchen was somewhat open. The staff members were all great, but again the food we were not impressed with. I ordered the brie sandwich- it was not warmed up and there was a LOT of brie. Now I like brie, don't get me wrong, but it was way too much. I thought it would be warmed up at least. I will say that the salad I had was fresh, so this was a plus! My husband got sandwich which he felt was ok. He also got a side of the \"tots\" which we both were not impressed by. Cool idea to use mashed potatoes but it was very paste like and just not good.",
