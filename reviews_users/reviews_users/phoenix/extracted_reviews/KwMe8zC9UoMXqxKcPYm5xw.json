Everything from the moment you walk in the door feels so cozy and attended to.  I am no sports fan, however I am a football sized hunk of red meat fan. I highly recommend Shula's Steak House to anyone looking for an unforgettable experience dining in Chandler.  This is probably the finest steak house this side of Downtown PHX.",

    "text": "Don't get me wrong, it's a fine steak and generally good food w/ solid service... BUT at the price point (100+ a head), you can do much better (think Mastro's - or if you need to be in a casino, Cholla steakhouse is a better option).  Reservations: + - OpenTable - super easy, table ready for us on arrival  Service: -  - Host was a goofy kid.  Very nice, but awkward and stumbling trying to sell the football story (hosts have to carry the football to the table and tell you about the 72 Dolphins) - Servers (lead + 1-2 supporting) were all nice and basically competent.  Seems like amateur hour for such a high-end steakhouse.  Watched as each passed my empty scotch several times w/ no one even offering another.  Too bad.  At 14/glass, that's 3 bucks a shot in their pocket they forgo...  still, nice, but again amateurish... no concept of cadence (drinks fast, bread slow, 1st course fast, steaks slow, long pause for desert menu, etc.) that you'd get at say Mastro's or even Morton's - Runner who brought 1st course put my caesar down and as expected as if I wanted cracked pepper... when I said yes, she disappeared around the corner to retrieve the pepper mill ??? - No serious complaints, but definitely not up to standards of competing entries at this price point.  Drinks: + - MacCallan 12 served w/ acqua panna cube - GOOD.  easy, but at least they do it right - Wife's foo-foo drink - YUMMY.  Not exactly sure what it was (some kinda fruity gin drink dressed w/ fresh fruit/berries), but it was really good.  Dinner: + / - - Bread was fresh and surprisingly good (to the point where it's worth mentioning) - Caesar salad - YUMMY, real, maybe just a bit overdressed - French Onion soop - MEH.  Turine and chess piping hot, but yet soup inside lukewarm (?) - soup obviously premade and cold - then put into the turine and covered w/ cheese w/ expectation that the baking would make it adequately hot... - NY Strip - GOOD cut, WELL-SEASONED, OVERDONE.  Wife ordered Medium, but was pretty close to Med-Well (fortunately, she actually likes med-well, but felt silly ordering such on a 45 dollar steak).  Despite the overcook, it was still tender and tasty - Bone-in Filet (special) - GREAT cut.  WELL cooked.  OVERSEASONED.  POOR Bearnaise.  My filet was a perfect med-rare and ridiculously tender, but unfortunately was a bit overseasoned (salty).  It was served w/ Bearnaise on the side, but it came room-temp and tasted like mayonnaise and parsley (bummer, I love the taste of tarragon and was happily surprised at first to see on the plate).  Still, the great quality of the steak itself made it quite good overall - Mashed Potato - YUMMY.  Simple mashed w/ garlic+nutmeg (one of my favorite flavor combos) - Sauteed Mushrooms - SO-SO.  Decent as a steak topper, but not much flavor (odd given the types of mushrooms used) - Creamed Spinach - SOLID.  Heavy as one would expect with nice flavor.  Desert: N/A - Didn't bother as we were ready to move on at this point and the menu really didn't have anything that looked especially great  Dining Room: - - Loud, but not in a good high-end steakhouse way (like Gibson's in Chicago)...  - Cheesy, amateurish attempt at high-end environment - silly signed football placed on table listing the cuts (same as on menu), but autograph is on the underside of the ball, so you're not even sure who signed it. - Not dark, not bright.  Bottom Line:  Very high quality ingredients w/ competent preparation.  Generally solid, but not close to high-end service.   Should I find myself staying at Wild Horse Pass again (quite a nice hotel/casino for PHX), I'll be picking Ling & Louie's for dinner instead...  Just not worth the money overall.",

Felt like we were treated differently than all the tables around us that we consuming alcohol.  Beverages sat empty and our main waiter only visited our table again after I gestured to get him to the table.  The secondary wait staff constantly reached over in front of us to pick up plates and serve coffee.  Two of three Filets were over cooked.  Sides of Lobster Mac n Cheese and asparagus were great.  Ordered molten lava cake for desert.  Then we waited 20 minutes after our desert for our bill.  I actually called the main number to the restaurant to get the manager to our table because no waiters were in sight for such a long time.   We spent almost 3 hours at the table while other larger groups around us arrived and departed. When we complained to the manager the only thing we heard was how the wait staff said there was no delay.  Our bill was comped for 2 coffees and the desert.  I have been to some much nicer steak restaurants in the area and the service and food have not failed after numerous visits.",

    "text": "Shula's is located on the second floor of the Wild Horse Pass Hotel and Casino. There is a bit of walking to get to the restaurant and the ventilation in the casino needs some work. However, once inside the restaurant, any smell from the casino seems to disappear.  I made a reservation using OpenTable a week before as I assumed the restaurant might have a lot of guests since my work and another large group were attending conferences in the area and staying in the hotel. No matter the combination of time and party size, there was only one spot available. When I entered the restaurant, there were many open tables available.   The service here is a hit and miss. The receptionist seemed like a snob, not saying a word when I told them my name and reservation time. They just grabbed menus and gave me a look to follow. Maybe this person was too good for my group and I? We were also introduced to two rather enthusiastic waitresses which I didn't mind at all, but were absent quite a bit during our meal.  I didn't get a tour of the restaurant like some of the fellow reviewers had, but I was perfectly without it. I felt that the football and the menu of the steaks on it is a nice touch (luckily it was not placed on top of our plate) and the cart showing how each cut of steak looks is neat. I opted for the cowboy steak (medium rare) while my coworkers order the filet mignon (medium).   My cowboy steak was cooked perfectly while also having a little crust. I honestly felt that it was delicious. My coworkers filet mignon appeared to be good and they enjoyed it. We also ordered the lobster mashed potatoes and crab mac and cheese. The lobster mashed potatoes were decent while the crab mac and cheese were not special. Both seemed to have a subpar amount of seafood.  Prices are comparable to any steakhouse. I might come back when I attend another conference in the area and too lazy to drive to the restaurants off Ray Road.",

    "text": "Shula's tries to combine upscale steakhouse with football to disastrous (though frequently hilarious) results.  They take you on a \"tour\" before seating you, showing you a replica Lombardi trophy and telling you all about the '72 Dolphins undefeated season. I found it especially hysterical the hostess took extra care to point out this trophy is a replica. You mean the real Lombardi trophy isn't kept at a steakhouse inside a shitty Indian casino in Chandler, AZ???? Shocking. Equally entertaining was how the hostess kept droning on about the '72 Dolphins long after we made it clear we didn't care. Um lady? It's just me and 2 female coworkers. We're all hungry and none of us give a shit about the '72 Dolphins. Apparently we were also supposed to be impressed by the black-and-white pictures of the '72 Dolphins on the walls. Oooh, black-and-white pictures, how artsy. Someone took a couple photography classes at community college.  After concluding that fascinating \"tour\" we were finally taken to our table. We were all exchanging \"that was weird\" looks when the waitress handed us our drink menus and explained the steak menu was painted on the football she was carrying. I know what you're thinking, and the answer is yes, it was a regulation sized football and yes, it was hand painted. She made sure to mention this last fact twice. I mean, what kind of upscale steakhouse would it be if its steak menu was painted on a football by a... MACHINE??? Pish posh.  Anyway, that's when things went from amusing to \"I will never set foot in this restaurant again.\" The hostess puts the football on a tee and sets it down RIGHT ON MY COWORKER'S PLATE. Gross. I wish I had taken a picture cuz the look on her face was PRICELESS. The waitress seemed shocked and somewhat offended she asked for another plate. The nerve!!!  And this, my friends, was the straw that broke the proverbial '72 Dolphins back. I can handle being bored to death by an over-enthusiastic hostess. I can handle my menus hand painted on footballs. But if you have the nerve to charge $50-60 for a steak as this supposedly \"upscale\" steakhouse does, I will not tolerate a dirty football on my plate nor being treated like asking for a clean plate is an outrageous request.  We left without even drinking our waters",

I'm not impressed with the table side showing of the various cuts. Who goes to a steakhouse and doesn't know what a strip, ribeye or filet looks like? Between eight of us we covered the three cuts mentioned above. Not a bad piece meet among them. Sides were generous, definitely enough for 2. We had the twice baked and it was as good as any I've had. If you like cheese (I do) you like it. One disappointment was the wine list didn't have more than about 10 each of reds and whites. Not cheap, but priced at or slightly lower than Ruth's Chris or, our favorite, Arrowhead Grill in Glendale. Pricing seems fair for food almost, but not quite up to these other two places.",

We split the crab Mac and cheese for our side which could have feed 3 people. There were big pieces of crab in it. Yum!! For dessert we shared the dulce de leche cheesecake and it was outstanding.

    "text": "The hubby and I went back on Halloween since we had a bad experience for my bday and they were trying to redeem themselves. The host and hostess that were on were super friendly and smiled liked hosts should.  The restaurant was clean, as it should be.  Jeannie, Jeff, and Tyler (the one that has been there longer) were the people taking care of us.  Jeannie was really nice, seemed timid and unsure, I even had to tell her how to do one of the comps at the end.  We started with french onion soup (always a great choice), and blackened scallops with mango salsa ( tasted great, but was $14 for 2, salsa was okay, not a fan of mangoes).  Jeff took our order because they had gotten other tables, (just because there are 3 people helping each team does not mean they can handle 6 tables and still be effective). He got the chicken, meh; he liked it, but then again he will eat just about everything.  I got the quarterly special because it comes with the pecan tart.  I asked for my steak to be mid rare and it came out medium, I let them know and said I didn't want it remade because I didn't want to wait that long for my meal to come back, the steak had really dry overcooked onions and mushrooms topping it, (told Bob but he made it seem like I was crazy since they are cooked to order, STILL HAPPENS!)  I did get the lobster add on, Jeff tried to push me into the bigger one which was $15 more but I had already stated which one I wanted, don't be pushy. It was good.  For the sides we got steamed asparagus, scallop potatoes, and truffle fries, (the truffle fries tasted like regular fries with parsley, tasted no truffle oil, and saw a couple specks of parm but couldn't taste it).  For dessert we had the chocolate bourbon pecan tart with vanilla bean ice cream.  We had the same thing on my bday and it was AMAZING!, however, this time it wasn't the same, I was informed that it came from the same company but that doesn't mean squat to me, the only way you are going to know that it didn't change at all is if it was made in house...speaking of, why is a restaurant of this \"quality\" not making their own desserts?  If I had know that the tart was going to taste like that then I would have gotten something else all together.  Tyler was great! always filled our glasses, actually both of them ended up helping us and they did better than the servers.  Jeff asked if we wanted the rest of our stuff boxed up, and then decided that he needed to help other tables instead and pushed it off on the new Tyler, and while he ran to get the to go ramekins I stole the boxes and did it myself since I was ready to go and could do it quickly.  Took 20 minutes to get our bill and have Jeannie take the comps off and give it back, I didn't have to wait for change (luckily) because I made sure to have enough cash.  Bob was out doing his table touches and every time he came to our table he gave an awkward feeling, it was not natural at all, seemed very uncomfortable which I thought was weird since talking to him on the phone was great and he was funny, but not in person.    I think it is going to be a while before we go back, every time it seems to be something and for a restaurant that charges that much, it should never be anything that is less than outstanding",

Our reservation was for 615pm, we arrived at about 610pm, we were greeted very politely and the host congratulated us on our anniversary and escorted us to our seat.  The dining room was very clean and inviting.  Our waiter introduced himself immediately and took our drink orders.  Drinks came out quickly along with some amazing hot fresh bread.  The waiter discussed specials and left us the look at the menu.  He returned shortly and asked if we had any questions, we ordered at that time.  We started with the seafood trio which was absolutely incredible, up on finishing the trio, our salads came, wife had the wedge salad and I chose the caesar.  Salads were delicious!  Next came the main course, wife had a bone in filet, yes, a bone in filet!  I had the medley of filet medallions, crab cake, and scallops with a corn salsa!  Food was incredible and service was over the top.  Our bill was around $180 before tip.  Worth every penny and this experience set the bar and was the best overall dining experience I've ever had!!  Highly reccomend!  We will be back!!!  Great job Shulas and thank you for a memorable evening!",

This past Friday we had a group of 7 at the WHP location.  We had two servers, which makes you think that you will get great service, however, that was not the case.  Not only was the service horrific, but we were charged a mandatory 20% gratuity - for a party of 7 receiving horrible service.  No thanks",

    "text": "The service and staff were very nice. The problem that I had was with the food. In a nutshell, the 22 oz bone-in ribeye that I ordered medium came out between medium well to well done. It was also extremely salty and overpriced. Usually a steak with this thickness is easier to undercook than to overcook. I'm uncertain if they were in a rush to close for the evening hence why my selection arrived this way.  It's an establishment that tries to look hoity toity with the push cart menu but the quality doesn't seem to compare. Just my personal opinion, I would spend my money elsewhere even with the casino comps.",

    "text": "Unbelievable disappointment. Sat at the bar for dinner. The younger one was glued to two gentlemen at the end discussing recent gambling activities. They were obvious regulars which seemed to make anyone else at the bar inconsequential and yes I mean it to be that strong. The other bartender, a little older, was much more aware of the dynamics of customer service but due to the other one not contributing at all, he had to spread himself thin. We didn't have a good feeling about service so we just ordered one rib eye steak and creamed spinach and kept it simple. Then it really went downhill, both the steak and the GREY creamed spinach tasted like the cook dumped a salt shaker on them. It was beyond belief salty. The salt on the steak was obviously put on late as it was just sitting on it, not dissolved, just poured on it. The spinach was grey, like pencil lead grey and, yes, salty! It was so much it was bizarre. This was our first time there, we didn't know the cook, owe him money or have somehow pissed him off! So, we wait, to talk to one of the bartenders, wait, wait, wait...... Then when the older one, still making up service for the younger one not moving from his post with the 2 guys at the end, finally came by, we told him the issues, paid and left. The food was so bad, and we had to wait for so long, by that time it felt like we were stuck in a bad meal time warp with no escape. We just wanted out.  One more fact which made this so bizarre - there were only 4 tables of customers in the restaurant area. This was not a busy time so that can't be a contributing reason.",

I buy and make Prime steaks at my house that are 100x better and cost $8/lb from Costco.  Filet was decent, but nothing special Cowboy Ribeye was bad. Way too lean and tough. No flavor.  The sides, Creamed Spinach and Roasted Corn were both fantastic, though overpriced for the quantity. Quality & Flavors were excellent.  Service was excellent.  I go to a lot of top-end places: Flemings, Mortons, Ditka's, etc... Shulas was the least impressive. I found The Keg to be better by a mile - even without considering the price.",

We started with dirty martinis with blue cheese olives and they were the best we had ever had then we shared a bottle of The Prisoner and it was delicious as always. For food, we started with the oysters on the half shell which were super fresh and really delicious especially with the atomic horseradish. I had the 8oz filet and the surf and turf. My boyfriend had the Kansas City Strip; Both were cooked to perfection. We also split the Crab Mac and Cheese, Grilled Asparagus, and Truffle Fries. The Crab Mac and Cheese was my favorite thing I ate all night. It was garlicky, creamy, cheesy, and full of lump crab meat. The Truffle fries were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. We ended with the 7 layer chocolate cake which was entirely too decadent to finish. In addition to the amazing meal, the service was spot on. We had a fantastic night at Shula's and highly recommend it to anyone.",

I can go forever about how much I love this place. So let's me tell you what I get.  I place the order of my crab mac and cheese, my girlfriend and I usually split that. With the order of the bacon wrapped BBQ shrimp. So delicious. The order only comes with 4, but they are jumbo size. Then we place an order of the 12 oz filet mignon for her and the 24 oz porterhouse for me. My friend always gets the ribeye but I prefer the porterhouse. They are both really delicious. Shulas also has a big selection of wine and spirits. There's something for everyone.  Between us two we always end up paying about $180 or a little more. Like I said, it's pricey but once you try it you'll never regret it. It's a once in a while thing for me but I'm always looking forward to the next time! Super friendly staff and excellent service. See you guys soon!",

When I ask told them that my steak was over cooked they argued with me that it was cooked right.  They were not apologetic.  Instead they were acting like they were doing me a favor by not charging me for my steak that I didn't eat.  I highly recommend that you do not try this place.

    "text": "Disappointing would be the best word to describe my experience. It was a typical busy end of the month Saturday night for us and we made reservations for 8:30 pm(since we worked late that day).The restaurant is located UPSTAIRS in the Wild Horse Hotel/Casino and it is much easier to park with HOTEL SIDE Valet then to try and navigate the garage or parking lot.. From there you will avoid the excessively smoky casino main floor as well. We arrived a couple of minutes early and checked in at the Shula's desk. There is absolutely no waiting area for guests,with the exception of two livingroom chairs....,so... it is whoever can plop their fat ass in there the fastest. Unfortunately I never was that great at musical chairs..haha..  You are forced to stand and wait or go back outside to the smoke. We were seated 12 minutes late..no big deal,..then left alone for 6 minutes at a very cold 2 seater table ( under the vent) with no water or bread. Once we were initially served ( they were cordial) we were given menus and some iced water and wine options. 7 minutes later the comp bread and butter came out and it was crunchy and delicious. We ordered the NY Strip 16 oz,,medium,lobster bisque soup, blackened scallop appetizer and wedge salad with vinegarette and asparagus. It was a birthday treat ,so they later comped us a nice chocolate cake slice with strawberry decor...which was very tasty initially but super sweet...could not finish it. The salad was crisp and delicious and the dressing was just right with the blue cheeze bacon toppings. The Lobster bisque tasted like a lukewarm bowl of canned soup, bland,milky and for $12 bucks a major flop...we sent it back and asked to delete from the order. The 16 oz boneless strip steak came next and it was thick and cooked properly but very salty and overly quick- seasoned.  I have had much better cuts at the K*g for a better value....it did not settle very well with my stomach either.  But that being said,it was grilled correctly, just not marinated the right way....too chewy. The asparagus was steamed to perfection and it was by far the best prepared part of the meal. Kudoos for perfect asparagus...so you got that going for you...which is nice. if you LOVE noisy restaurants, this is the place for you...the decible level inside the place was louder than the bar area with the reggae jazz band.....a little bit annoying for fine dining. The scallops were limp and burnt ( they claim they were not and when I sent them back the waitress brought me back one with the black scraped off of the scallop. I thought that was piss poor service from a steak house. They did not remove them from the ticket,so 14 dollars was wasted. I didn't gripe since they comped the chocolate cake.....just know I won't be back here. Too slow, too noisy and food............well you can get a better meal at Bla** Ang** or The Ke* for way less strain on your wallet. Maybe they have so much business from the casino it doesn't matter....but if I was a Shula, i would have the manager running two-a days to get in shape and studying the playbook. CT*",

The decor rings classic steakhouse. It has dark woods, an elegant ambiance, and waiters in traditional tuxedos. There is a lot of football memorabilia to honor Don Shula (hence the name). The wait staff is very good for an upscale restaurant. They knew the menu well and were very friendly.  The bread is great, warm yet crusty, and served with butter. I had the seared ahi appetizer, which was excellent. It was perfectly rare with sesame seasoning.  I had the 12 ounce filet, cooked medium rare with a nice char on the outside. It had a great degree of marbling, as you would expect from prime beef. Overall, a very solid filet.  For sides, I had creamed spinach and potatoes. Both were great and clearly every element was homemade.  Dessert was a dark chocolate layer cake. It was moist and decadent, definitely a must for chocolate lovers like myself.",

The wait staff knew it and made several comments about it, and I informed the manager, who said she would talk to them about it. If she did, which I doubt, there was no action taken. An offer to reseat us to a different table after we are 3/4 of the way through our meal is useless. Besides there was no location in the restaurant that you couldnt hear their yelling.   They should have been given an option to be quiet or leave. But your staff is clearly more interested in making money. You wont be getting any more of ours. And we live here, so we would have been more frequent customers, as opposed to these people, who were clearly visitors.   Very very disappointed in your organization Don Shula. I was a fan of those 1972 Dolphins. I dont believe your commitment to be the best  Follow up. I submitted an email through their online web contact form. I got back an email that started with   Hello [your-name],  Thank you for contacting Us!  One of our Team Shula members will respond shortly.  No contact in over a week Nice way to treat your customers",

We started with soup and salad. The burrata salad was fantastic. I even asked for extra pickled onions because they were so good. My husband had the French onion soup that was very good. We then shared a fried lobster tail that was a special for the night recommended by our waiter. He was right and it was amazing and very memorable. Next we went for the porterhouse that we shared. On top of all the wine, I was stuffed and didn't have much room left for the steak. I still managed to have some and it was great. They also gave us a birthday desert for my hubs that was delicious and very much appreciated. We will definitely be back for special occasions and recommend the restaurant very highly.",

    "text": "Shula's Steak House!   Let's do lunch......Nope, not a good idea.  Having dined numerous times at Shula's in the evening, was excited to learn that they were now open for lunch.  BIG MISTAKE.  We arrive about 1 pm and are promptly seated.  Our \"waitress\" brought water and took our drink order, which was promptly delivered.  Looking over the menu, the Market seafood caught my wife's eye and she inquired about what was available.  Today they had Salmon and Chilean Sea Bass.  As Sea Bass is her favorite, that's what she ordered, pan seared with beurre blanc sauce.  I ordered the steak sandwich with garlic wedge fries. We also ordered a Caesar Salad to share which our \"waitress\" delivered promptly.  Then we became invisible.  The adjacent table received their salads from their server, along with Shula's fresh out of the oven bread, which never made an appearance, probably because we were invisible.  Drink glasses were refilled at her other two tables, while ours sat empty.  Although the other guests were seated within 10 feet of ourselves, not one time in the 4 trips she made did our \"waitress\" ever look in our direction.  Probably because we were still in visible.  Only after she came to remove the salad plates was I able to beg for a refill of our beverages.   After another 20 minutes she arrives with our lunch.  One problem, sorta like our invisibility, the Chilean Sea Bass could not be found.  Some how it had magically turned into Salmon.  Not my wife's favorite nor what she ordered.  \"Waitress\" wanted to know if wife wanted to keep the asparagus and potatoes  while she returned the Salmon to the kitchen.  No thank you.  As our \"waitress\" hurried off to the kitchen for some more magic, wife decided she didn't want to wait another 1/2 hour to eat, while watching me eat my sandwich.  We ended up sharing my sandwich.   \"Waitress\" offered us a piece of chocolate cake as compensation, but declined due to the fact my wife is diabetic.   Manager comped the salad. Steak sandwich and two drinks cost me $25. plus a $5 tip.  Not a happy experience all around.  I guess we'll stay invisible at Shula's for a while, at least during the lunch hour.",

The lobster bisque looked great along with the steaks. The twice baked potato was huge and very good.  Extensive wine and cocktail list. Service was A+.  We didn't need a reservation for 730 on a Wednesday night but seems like you might on s weekend.  Lots of Shula artifacts around the place. But if you aren't into football, it's no big deal.  The casino underneath does allow smoking so you can smell the smoke as you enter the restaurant so beware. But it's not a problem inside.  It's not that fancy although it looks as so. I had on flip flops and didn't feel underdressed. Would easily come back  Go hungry!",

The people that we were meeting during our stay had made reservations for our first night in AZ so my body thought it was 10:30 pm before we were seated. I generally don't eat at steak houses as the good ones are very expressive and the moderately priced one sometimes provide less than quality steak.  The service throughout the meal was good...not great. Food kept coming out of the kitchen at a decent pace and the drinks were refilled quite well. I must say that the Kansas City strip steak that I order was cooked and seasoned very well and 3 other steaks ordered at out table were prepared well; however, one of the filets order at the table was just mutilated (too late to send back). My wife and I shared a side dish of spinach and au gratin potatoes. The spinach had way too undercooked garlic on it and the potatoes were an initial \"no show\". When the au gratin potatoes showed up, they were tasty but runny.  All in all, the wine was good. The majority of our protein was cooked appropriately. The side dishes could use a little work. The food itself is probably a 4, but for the price, the noise and the kitchen errors, the experience was a 3.",

I have to say that regardless of the high quality service, Shula still doesn't have much of the potentials to win me.   I like how they do a short presentation before serving and taking orders, and the whole dining experience makes me feel like an upper class diner. However, the lobster tails don't have that much flavors, as well as the steak - even though it was nicely cooked.  This is somewhat an upscale restaurant, I will revisit, but not on the regular time frame.",

All of their meat is extremely high-quality and you get the meal that you pay for. I can't speak enough for how fantastic the staff is! All of them were super friendly and charming. They made the evening not only fun but magical. I really like how the sides were big enough to share so each person didn't have to order their own side. Because it was her anniversary they even gave us a free dessert of a multiple layer chocolate cake that was just incredible! We also had a few the cocktails (I had a Mojito, and my husband had the whiskey sour) which were super yummy very well with the meal. I have to say my husband's whiskey sour was one the best I've ever sipped. Don't let the fact that the steakhouse is in a casino fool you. It is one of the nicest places you can get a stick of the valley and worth the trip just outside of town to go and have a lovely evening even if you do not plan to gamble. Thank you Shula for a wonderful evening!!!!!",

We were greeted by a pleasant staff and seated in a side booth which was great for a sense of privacy but proved likely to be a problem. The food is very good but a bit pricey in my opinion. We ordered crab cakes which were good but not comparable to those from visits to Baltimore. The sea scallops were prepared well. It's a steak house and I suggest stick to steaks. I would have given more stars but for the very poor service. We were in a side booth  and felt forgotten. Never once did anyone check back with us. When we finished we waited  over 10 minutes for anyone to notice we were done. The waitstaff were abrupt and seemed rushed. I will say this  is quite different from past experiences here where the attentiveness of the staff was a big part of our decision to return. A small issue was that when our server initially meet us he offered a complimentary  free piece of \"birthday\" cake but we only received one. Not a big issue but a reflection of the lack of interest or attention to US by service staff.",

A month later they are still raving about the scallops.  They'd do the trio again but get double scallops instead of the crab cakes that were not exciting.  Since the fish special was sea bass and suppose to be good (it was), I got that and shared with a friend that had the trio so I got to try the fabulous scallops.  Of course, after reading the review about the sandy scallops I'm am kinda fearful of our next experience there.  My other friend got the ribeye which is one of her favorites there (she's a regular).  I wanted one of the chocolate desserts that you need to order during dinner, but my friend said they had outstanding creme brulee which is my favorite.  Big mistake, they don't have regular vanilla.  They offer a trio with two having liqueur flavors and won't let you have 3 vanilla.  So no dessert for me....or so I thought.  Because it was my birthday they brought me a piece of awesome chocolate cake.  So big and rich I took most of it home.   Service was good, we seemed to have 3 people taking care of us.  Even though we've gotten away from $100 meals...I can see us returning.",

It's fine dining service, very professional, mixed with a fantasy football man-cave. Steak menu written on a football in the middle of the table and wall to wall football photos.   The service was excellent. I wasn't impressed with the food at all. Tasteless. From beginning to end. The only thing that stood out is the fried squid. Good appetizer that I can get at TGI Fridays. Steak was cooked right, it just wasn't all that good. Desert was terrible. For nearly $300.00 it isn't worth it. I realize if you're stuck in the hotel, you don't really have that many choice but there is a mall just down the street surrounded by better restaurants. The cab fair is worth it to find a better place to dine.",

I was attending a vendor dinner, got the invite and couldn't turn down an offer for a ridiculously priced dinner and ...I love football so you can see the connection.    The football memorabilia was plentiful.  They even put an autographed football/menu on your table for a short time.    Our server, totally scripted in reading off all about the steaks, thanks for the meat lesson by the way, was very nice and totally handled our party of seven.    I ended up getting the crab cakes.  They were worth every penny.  Probably better than any seafood place back home.  I had a side salad and we ordered the crab and cheese macaroni, asparagus, and potatoes as sides.    I also indulged in the cherry noir martini, I even had two!  Very good.    Overall, very good dining experience.  I just don't see myself paying for this type of meal on my own.",

We were seated promptly and greeted by our waiter shortly after.  Our waiter noted that there would be 3 servers tending to us.  I would have been have with one.  We were ignored.  Our water and iced tea went unfilled as did our bread.  The prices at Shula's warrant attention to their guests.  We received very little.  Our steaks were very good and cooked as we ordered the.  The bread and salads were good.  I found the mashed potatoes to be bland and forgettable.  The corn and asparagus were good.  Though I know the prices are a bit less than City Hall, I would rather pay the difference for the attention to detail and better food.",

At the end of the day, it is a \"steakhouse\" in a casino and just not that great and prices just to high.  You can pay the same for Flemings or Ruth Chris and get much tastier food.",

The server did warn me that it would take about 30 minutes, because they do not butterfly cut the steak. This is fine because j appreciate that they want to do it right. My steak was juicy, buttery and SO TENDER. So great considering all other steakhouses just char a steak til it's bone dry. Love this place.",

Prime rib was bland and mostly chewy gristly slop, the included yorkshire pudding was tough like old shoe leather. The crab mac & cheese was extremely fishy tasting and smelling, none of us ate more than a bite of it... and the potato gratin was an oily mess. Everything was heavily crusted with bread crumbs. How can any decent restaurant screw up potatoes??  First and last time I'll ever try a Don Shula's. You can get a meal that's 10x as good at almost 1/2 the price at Flemings, or go to Donovan's and get a fantastic meal at the same price point, with much better ambiance and service.  My expectations were obviously way to high for a steak joint in a casino.",

As far as the food was concerned the experience was started when we were served our bread basket filled with the most delicious sour dough bread we have ever tasted!! My wife ordered pan seared scallops with an add on of crab legs!  And I ordered the 12 oz bone in filet. Both entrees were cooked exactly to order. Very flavorful and prepared with just the right amount of seasonings. For our side dishes we ordered the crab Mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes. Both side were absolutely delicious and clearly enough to be shared by two. If you go to Shulas you've got to order the crab Mac and cheese!!!!  Sooooo good!! Dessert wa also awesome. Trio crime brulee was delicious. We will be back very soon!!!",

Initially we weren't told about a hat rule but I was was wearing a cabbie hat and told to take it off after we were seated. To spend that kind of money and be told what to wear is beyond me, not to mention not being told when initially reserved the seating the first time.  Me and wife left after talking to the manager and he mentioned there are certain circumstances that are considered, that a hat like mine he would accept.  Regardless I think it's bullish!t coming in and willing to pay that kind of money to eat or drink to be told to remove your hat. I wasn't dressed outlandish and I get restaurants can refuse services based on certain circumstances but this was surprising especially because it was in a Casino setting.  Definitely won't be back even if I'm not wearing a hat.",

    "text": "2.5* rounded up for service & food only.   We have dined at Shula's on numerous occasions, always enjoying the atmosphere, food, and service. Scott chose it for his 50th Birthday dinner last night, and we were both looking forward to this very special occasion.   The Hostess Brianna was lovely and welcoming, the \"Happy Birthday\" sign at the table was a nice touch. Shula's is dimly lit, with the usual clubby motif present in many steakhouses. Brian was our server: he is charming, knowledgeable, professional, and was a pleasure all evening; his team kept water and iced tea glasses full, cleared dishes quickly, used the crumb catcher, offered fresh cracked pepper, and brandy for lobster bisque; the truly lovely serving assistant (I forget her name, because of an ongoing disturbance I was distracted) was delightful, she even offered to remove my lobster tails from the shell.   Since we have been here more than a half dozen times, we knew what we wanted: I had the Very Dirty Belvedere Martini up with blue cheese stuffed olives, it was only my second cocktail since July, and it was perfect! A nibble of the bread and quality butter almost made me eat more, but I refrained. We both started with lobster bisque: mine with brandy added tableside, Scott's without: I enjoyed it quite a bit while Scott found it too salty; the serving assistant noticed, and wrapped it up for me to-go. This is when another party nearby became rambunctious, and where the evening turned...  An adjacent table with a large party was quite loud, at first it wasn't terrible, but in short order one inebriated woman yelling, making strange noises (bird calls? drunk ass hoots, I dunno) and was dropping Fbombs, the rest of the party was loud, but not vulgar. Scott is a very calm person and was beginning to get upset: he asked if I'd like to move, which I declined because I was sure the party would be asked to leave, moved, or at least STFU. Our server assistant and Brian tried to ensure we enjoyed our meal - our shared wedge salad was classically perfectly executed, my twin lobster tails, Scott's filet mignon, and both the grilled asparagus and mushroom sides were all delicious - but, accompanied by the cacophony of the whole party nearby, it was not enjoyable. Scott was visibly upset during the remainder of the meal, most of which we took to-go. Shortly before the decadent and very kind gesture of complimentary seven layer chocolate cake - with a  candle - and light, tasty cheesecake arrived, the loudest \"neighbor\" started arm wrestling whilst cursing and generally being a nuisance. I've never experienced this in a fine dining setting, and I lived in Las Vegas for 12 years!   We settled our check, thanked Brian, and as we left, we spoke to the Manager. We had seen her on the floor, and she had visited our neighbors when Drunky Drunkerson was loudly bellowing for more booze. As we were talking to her, one of our \"neighbors\" loomed in a menacing manner next to Scott. At this point, I'd have gladly cleaned his clock for ruining Scott's birthday. I just wanted to leave, the Manager was kind, but her answer was basically: she was overserved before arrival elsewhere. We did see the woman with a beer, but that really wasn't the point. I feel this could and should have been handled much, much better by management. My birthday is next week, and I won't even bother to use my Shula's free entree coupon. It will be a long while before we return. This was $225 and an evening better spent elsewhere. The only thing that saved this from 2* is Brian and his team's service, and the always enjoyable food.",

    "text": "2.5 Stars  My wife took me there for my birthday back in June. Food was good but we had a few other issues (forgot items on order, abandoned service, etc.) from which they sent us a gracious $100 gift card. this is the only reason we returned. I won't get into those details.   As far as our experience going back on Nov 13th to use the previous mentioned gift card....mediocre at absolute best! I ordered the 22oz cowboy ribeye with a twice baked potato and my wife decided on the ahi tuna and crab mac n cheese for dinner.   The steak: My \"prime cut, aged ribeye\" was more like a frys choice ribeye, which I can cook better than the one I had here. When you age a steak it breaks down muscle tissue enhancing the tenderness and natural beef flavor. That was NOT the case with this steak. I cut my wife a piece to try because I wanted her opinion and I exaggerate you not she discarded the steak into her napkin. Granted I cut her another piece and she said \"it's ok but you can do better with a store bought steak.\" The steak was flavorless (even though I ordered blackened with heavy seasoning - I learned from the last trip) and I won't go as far as saying tough, but it sure wasn't prime aged tender by any means.  The twice-baked potato: I think it may have been thrice-baked. It was drier than a popcorn fart. Good thing I had a cold beer to wash it down. Nothing else to say about that.  The seared ahi: Cold, flavorful, cooked perfect and delicious. Plain and simple. I'm not sure how you could mess this one up though.  The crab mac n cheese:If I was able to swim in this bowl of amazing creation I would have. Big lumps of crab meat, creamy cheese, amazing noodles = heaven in a bowl.  Conclusion: Bottom line is I came here for a prime-cut, aged, tender, juicy steak. I got a less than mediocre, mostly flavorless, not tender, choice quality cut of ribeye beef. This steak alone was $48 in itself. I can do much better for much cheaper at T*xas Ro*dhouse. I damn near ordered the 48oz porterhouse too. I was a hungry man. Sure glad I didn't waste my time on that. The wifes meal was the star. My meal, well, you can see how I felt about spending that kind of money on it. I gave it a 2nd try and can say it was my last. Too many other great options in the Phoenix area to waste anymore time at this one.  You fumbled Shulas. I recovered and I'm taking it straight to another house.",

It's a gem. Weve been here a few times; the food and service are always top notch. We'll be back for sure.",

We were there to celebrate my birthday - if you sign up for their emails, they give you a free birthday entree which is a great deal as this place is a bit pricey. Of course my certificate was received one day too late, but we will just have to return :) The French onion soup lived up to the hype! My husband ordered a 12 oz filet which was phenomenal, could have cut it with a fork it was so tender. I ordered the peppercorn chicken, and thankfully they serve the sauce on the side because it was not my favorite. This chicken and the potatoes au gratin were sadly bland, not \"bad\" but lacked depth of flavor. The chicken is split with the bones in it, and had a nice crusty skin, so I was surprised when it didn't have a lot of flavor going on. The truffle fries were sooo good, really glad we ordered them and would do it again. The bread is also very tasty and they serve a huge portion. I couldn't make it through my meal so I skipped desert, next time!  Some reviews have mentioned parking being rough, but I didn't think it was bad, free parking garage close by. The worst part is walking through clouds of smoke on the Casino floor to get to the rear of the building and up the escalator to Shula's. They can't help that, but it is annoying to walk through that on the way to a fancy meal.",

The desserts were also excellent. The reason for the low rating was due to main entrees not accompanied by enough sides. You have to order individual sides like cream spinach, asparagus or any starch. By end of day, you end up having to order 3 or 4 items for one meal.  Service was great but you have to walk through the casino up the escalator to get there.",

    "text": "Went here for a client dinner and it was fabulous!   I'm always a little skeptical when dining someplace where someone has their name on a restaurant outside of Vegas, but I was so pleasantly surprised!  The waitstaff was a little slow for having two servers wait on each table. Surprisingly slow. I sat with my oyster plate in front of me long after I was finished. Same thing with my salad plate (both were obviously finished). I actually had to call the waitress over because it was beginning to get ridiculous. It still took a few more minutes to get it out from under me though.  The bread they serve is a warm sourdough (or some variation thereof) and was so soft and delicious. The butter on it made me feel like it was all I needed to be completely happy as a meal.   I ordered the Blue Point oysters and they were of course delicious. They didn't offer any horseradish which I thought was strange, but I didn't need it anyway. My customer ordered the seared ahi tuna and I didn't like it nearly as much. It tasted a little dry, but he seemed to enjoy it.   I also ordered the house salad and it was probably the best I've ever had. It had artichoke, tomatoes and cucumbers and tasted so fresh that I could have sworn they picked it out of the garden for me. I loved this.   For dinner I ordered salmon and asked for it grilled. It came out perfectly cooked and flaky with a beautiful pink color. It was very good. As a side I ordered grilled asparagus which was a great accompaniment.   My customer ordered the chilean sea bass. It was actually much better than I thought it would be, I just had a little bite, but I would definitely try it if I go back.   For dessert we decided to share the very chocolatey  souffle. When it came out it had fallen and was undercooked so they brought us this huge slice of chocolate cake. The first bite I knew it was frozen. I asked and they confirmed that while it was made at the corporate office it was still frozen. This is my biggest pet peeve. Fine restaurants should NEVER serve frozen cake, it's disgusting. I'm surprised more people don't complain because it was just so...fake. We ignored it.   One last thing, while we were there the comedian playing next door, Ron White, wanted to dine here. The waiter came over (our other one) and said that he would be sitting next to us and to please not disturb him. I thought it was pretty tasteless to think I'd interrupt my not-so-cheap meal in order to gawk at and fawn over some cut-rate comedian playing a casino. Not classy at all.   The food here is incredible, I highly recommend it, just don't expect phenomenal service to go with that.",

The service is where they lost a couple of stars. Our server was very knowledgeable and professional, but seemed irritated that we showed up at 10:20pm (they closed at 11) despite having called ahead to make sure this wouldn't be an issue.  The first patron to order in our group ordered the porterhouse, medium with a baked potato and a lobster tail. The second patron said, \"I'll have that exact same thing, except medium rare on that steak.\" I was third in the group, and asked for the same as well, except with a rare steak. The first two orders were delivered with a baked potato, and mine was absent. The waiter claimed that he didn't hear me ask for a baked potato until I reminded him that both of us ordered the same as the first patron. He remembered, and apologized, but informed me that they didn't have any more potatoes. Oh well. They looked good, anyways. ;-)",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me here recently before seeing a show at the casino, it was our first time dining at Shula's. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and would go again if we were staying at Wild Horse.   Details... The bread was hot and good. We started with the Ceasar salad, but as another reviewer experienced, even though we told our waitress we were going to split it, they brought out the salad and an extra plate. We agreed that they should have split the salad for us; it wasn't that big of a deal, but for a nice restaurant I was surprised. The Ceasar was just OK, the croutons were soggy but it wasn't drowning in dressing so that was good.     I ordered the 8oz filet ($38), my bf had the surf-and-turf ($75), and we split the lobster mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach. After reading earlier reviews I was nervous about how our steaks would come out after seeing so many had problems with over or under done steaks. I tried to order my steak \"medium rare plus, so between medium rare and medium\" the waitress said they couldn't do that...what?! So I just went with medium and kept my fingers crossed it would be ok. Lucky for me, the steak came out perfect BUT if I was a person that liked my steak a True medium it would have been very under done. My boyfriend also ordered his steak medium and it came out the same, we agreed it definitely was not a medium steak. But that was just fine with us, they were perfectly done and very tender, not one bad bite. Steaks came with bernaise sauce which was a nice surprise, I hardly used it though because the steaks were so tasty (although a bit salty) on their own.  My bfs lobster tail was cooked perfect and there was some seasoning on it already, so you didn't even need to dip it in butter.   We both did not care for the lobster mashed potatoes, I would have preferred plain mashed potatoes. There was big chunks of lobster, which was nice, but there was a funky gravy on top that I didn't like. The creamed spinach was very good. Not too creamy and swimming in cheese or cream, just enough, so you could still taste the spinach.    I would go again if we were staying at the Wild Horse hotel, but not go out of our way to dine at Shula's. For an expensive meal like that I would hope for great not just very good.",

Nothing was particularly bad, but I would say everything we ordered tasted like something you would eat at Chilli's or Applebees. Even the specialty cocktails were a big disappointment and very overpriced. As far as service goes, the hostess and our server were very friendly and accommodating but I have never experienced such slow service at a restaurant at this price point. We had to remind our server about missing items and wait about 20 minutes for him to bring the check. I did like the decor and thought that the football theme was fun but the way the tables are positioned makes the restaurant feel crowded even though it was not very full the night we went. The tables are also way too small to accommodate the way they serve the side dishes (family style). To sum up, even though I really wanted to like this place, it was not a good experience at all. Please save your money.  We went for my husband's birthday dinner because it is close to where we live but I wish we would have just driven to Scottsdale and gone to Fogo de Chao.",

    "text": "I wish \"underwhelmed\" was the best I could say about this place but a more honest impression would be supreme disappointment.  We were seated and ordered a $170 bottle of wine - it took 20 minutes for the server to come back and we didn't even get water in the meantime. I actually had to get up and find someone to pour us water. It apprently helps to be friends with or share pictures of your kids with the server to get assistance. I almost had a pitcher of ice in my lap while the table next to us had their water poured with a napkin as a splash guard.  The tomato/fresh mozzarella salad was sad...I would imagine better in a high school cafeteria. The tomatoes were white, not ripe and the balsamic dressing average. The 2 bright spots:  1)  the BBQ shrimp, though under cooked a bit, the fresh basil was a great burst of flavor combo with the BBQ sauce, 2) the grilled asparagus with balsamic reduction (sauce is not mentioned). The sides are not the portions you would anticipate - True servings for 2-3, a couple of bites for 4, and I really mean bites not heaping spoonfulls. The crab mac & cheese was decent for flavor but left both crab and cheese to be desired. The plates weren't hot, my medium-rare filet was barely warm and chewy with so-so flavor and cooked unevenly. My brother's porterhouse came rare not med-rare and was sent back. After 10 minutes we had to ask where it was (something about we all have pagers and they will let us know - but apparently there was a pager failure). It wasn't even worth trying desert the disappointment was too much to bear....I was embarassed to bring to my family here and pay so much for so little. For a place that boasts they \"eat, breathe and sleep\"  meat I would suggest that they go back to bed and you spend your money at any Mastro's, Capital Grill,  or even The Keg.",

Five of us girls went on a Saturday night and spent over 2.5 hours at dinner, with drinks food and dessert.  It was one of the best meals I have ever had and the service was top notch.",

    "text": "Although the food was quite good, I must say that never in all of my vast dining experiences have I had such a ridiculous encounter. The general manager, Bob, attempted to seat the three of us at a table that was crowded with other diners, while the other end of the restaurant was empty. One of our party members is hard of hearing, so we requested to sit in a quieter spot. Bob almost broke down in tears and pleaded, \"Can we just stick with the plan?\" So we were seated at his original choice. The reservation was for 3 - I have the email comfirmation from Open Table, and he whined that the place setting was only for two and \"how come we had three people?\" Shocked - we sat down to view our menus. Now here comes the really amazing part. There were only 2 menus for the three of us. I called him over and asked if I could have another menu. His words exactly - \"When there are three people at a table and one is part of a couple, we only give two menus.\" Then he proceeded to stare at me. I told him that I was NOT going to share a menu, and he ran off to retrieve one for me. Had we not been going to see the BB King concert at the venue next door, we would have left immediately. Never have I heard of such a thing. This man is clearly not suited to deal with the public or have anything occur \"outside the plan\". Completely bizarre and we will not go back.",

    "text": "I gave this four stars only because we've been twice prior and have absolutely loved it. If I was grading on this visit alone I would have awarded three stars. We went to Shula's for my birthday dinner, which included a free entree.  The dinner was amazing with one exception...MY ENTREE.  The service was fast and efficient, bread and wine were wonderful and the beefsteak tomato and gorgonzola salad was easily split by the two of us. The two tomato slices were huge and dominated the salad, so if you like that much tomato this is the salad for you. My wife thought it was spectacular; it was a little much for me. My wife ordered the special, which was a crusted Chilean Sea Bass and was absolutely perfectly prepared, while I ordered the 16 oz. New York Strip. At a quality restaurant my wife will normally order a seafood dish, I'll order a steak and we'll work the whole splitzy thing. When my steak was delivered they ask you to cut into the middle to determine if it is properly prepared. I always order my steak medium rare, so I cut into it and it was still raw in the middle. While they were putting the steak back on the grill my wife and I split the seabass and were amazed at how thick the cut of seafood was and how perfectly moist and flavorful it was served. I feared it might be undercooked in the middle due to its size, but the fear was unfounded. The steak was returned about half way through the seabass and I while it was now a perfect medium rare I could not believe how tough and bland it was. My wife commented when she saw me adding salt and pepper to the steak as I don't think I've ever had to add anything at a fine steakhouse. I told her to taste hers and she immediately had me pass the salt and pepper to her. Very disappointing. For a side we ordered the crab mac/cheese which is always a winner and tonight was no different. We rotate the side on our visits between the crab mac/cheese and lobster mashed potatoes and both are phenomenal. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the layered chocolate cake we had comped for my birthday as it was huge and we just took it to go. All in all we had an enjoyable dinner experience, but the weakest part of the meal should not be one of their signature steaks. From a meat standpoint I'll stick to either the filet or prime rib, both of which are top notch.",

Holy Jesus and Hallelujah this place is so insanely good my mouth is filling up with saliva as I write this. Not only are the servers attentive and obviously educated on the details and specifics of the menu, but not one has ever written down the order and messed it up at all, even a little.  By that I mean they remember the order without ever writing it down.  They get it right every time.  So basically I have four words for you FILET AND CRAB MAC.  Trust me as if I were your brain surgeon--you're going to want to get that crab mac and cheese.  And the portions are gigantic, easy split among even 3 people.  Yum and yum, check and mate.",

We waited for about 10 minutes to be seated even tho we had a reservation.  Service was slow.  Appetizers were pretty good so the food is getting a 2 star rating, but the entrees were terrible.  The chicken and steak were both overcooked, the twice baked potato was cooked probably 4 times and must have been sitting out since lunch because it was horrible.  The Brussels sprouts were decent.    During the meal, my wife looks down at her pants and sees that there is GUM stuck to both sides of her legs.  We pull up the table cloth and there is a huge spread of gum under the bottom of the table and the table cloth.  GROSS.  We let the server know, he said \"oh sorry\" and took off.  When he asked us for boxes because we barely ate our food, we told him how disappointing it was so we would not be taking it home.  He had no comment.  We ordered a dessert because we assumed they couldn't mess up, which was True, the chocolate cake was great.  But instead of comping us for the cake b/c our anniversary or the horrible experience we'd just had, he later delivered a piece of cold apple pie and said \"happy anniversary\" and charged us for the full meal.  On the way out we let an assistant manager know, she had no desire to make any of this right.  What a bummer of an experience!  $150 for a meal I wouldn't have paid $20 for.  Very disappointed.",

The biggest wow were the drinks at the bar before and that is not what we should be saying.  I do like the history and steak training they gave us, but I would have skipped it if we could have more impressive food Instead. Sorry Shula's, too many places to linger on your average food. If you do still insist on going then at least go for the ribeye. It by far was the best of the meals. Filets were not!",

It is located in the Wild House Pass casino, so although it is more of a fine dining restaurant, you can get a away with casual clothes.   My husband and I opted for the surf and turf (crab for me, lobster for him). Best crab- fresh and sweet. The best part is that the slice the crab legs for you, so you just have to pull the meat out!!!   Sides are al a cart, but big portions.  The wait staff was amazing and attentive.

We had to flag her down to reorder drinks and practically beg for water. All in all very disappointing.

We have ordered prime rib many many times and I have never in my life not been able to cut a prime rib with a steak knife. It was ordered medium rare but we  couldn't cut it nor could we couldn't chew it. Besides the fact that the Yorkshire pudding was burnt to a crisp on the side of this I still can't get over the prime rib. I don't know how the cook served this. Marko was  wonderful about returning it and we ordered something else but I do have to admit this kind of spoiled the dinner. I've never returned anything this is actually my first time.

When the steak is served they cut into the steak to check the temperature.  The Steak was blue rare, not even close to medium rare.  The mashed potatoes were dry and not very good.  This place is over priced and survives on the name alone.  I will never go back.",

    "text": "On on November 17, 2011 went to Shula's steak house and below are the reasons why I was disappointed with the food and the service\"  1. We ordered a bottle of wine to the table and when the waitress poured the wine, she spilled it on our plates where we were eating bread and butter.  She then poured the 2nd glass and never even acknowledges there was a spill nor bothered to clean it up from the plate. 2. Our dinner took longer than expected - we waited about 45-55 minutes to get 2 steaks with sides as requested.  In most cases, steaks will not take an hour to cook or at least the waitress should give us heads up that it will take about an hour to get our food to the table.  I was very disappointed that our food took over an hour to come to the table. 3. The 12oz steak which was served to me was prepared well done as I asked for it to be medium - as you know there is a big difference between the 2 temperatures of the cooking the steaks.  I ate one bite and couldn't eat the rest.  Since our food took about an hour to come to the table, I didn't want to get another steak because it would have taken another hour or so for another steak.  4. Over the course of the night - I was very fed up with the food and most importantly fed up with the waitress as she lacked to be honest with her customers and no sense of professionalism if you make a mistake apologize!  It's not a big deal clean it up and listen to your customers.  This was a special dinner as this was my anniversary and I was very unhappy and displeased with the entire environment.  My girlfriend kept saying don't worry it's nothing and it's ok.  But honestly when you spend that much money on dinner you expect at a minimum to receive a decent food with a decent service.  But at the price I paid I expected top notch which I did not receive at all.    Waste of money! I don't recommend it and will never go there again.",

I had the prime rib and it was very good, the mashed potatoes were excellent. The bill was not too pricey, I think for the 4 of us with drinks was only $200 or something, we might even have had an appetizer too. I enjoyed it but have only went that one time, I am due for another trip there I think. I do think The Keg at Tempe Marketplace is a better steakhouse though.",

    "text": "My parents treated the 6 of us to dinner @ Shula's Steakhouse last night.  We arrived @ 6:30 so the place was pretty slow, but picked up around 7:30 when all the tables were full.  The web site states reservations are required, and the dress is business casual.    The place is covered in football memoribilia, but does have a classy look with the dark wood and white linen table cloths.    Our server was helpful and funny and gave us some great suggestions from wine to dessert.  We started with shared salads, one couple shared the caesar salad and another the wedge.  The blue cheese was amazing!  We also shared 2 orders of the BBQ bacon wrapped shrimp as an appetizer.  They were stuffed with basil and so yummy!  For dinner, we enjoyed 2 bottles of Markham Merlot, 4 guests dined on Steak Mary Anne (2 5 oz. filets smothered in a peppercorn sauce) the rest of us simply ordered 8 oz. filets.  Each steak was prepared as ordered.  We also split sides of crab mac and cheese - with real crab meat - grilled asparagus, sauteed mushrooms and a couple baked potatos.  The sides work family style and were plenty for the 6 of us to get a taste of each.  For dessert we had both the chocolate lava cake which was rich and decadent, and the chocolate souffle which was much lighter and not as sweet.  We \"rolled\" out of there for $650.00 including tip.   The restaurant offers a 48 oz steak that, if finished, inducts you into Shula's 48oz Club.  The sticker price for just the steak is $85. Now that's a challenge for Man vs Food!  This is a really nice place to celebrate something special, or have a nice night out with your spouse.",

Plus a salad & a desert! And all for only $80.. The fillet was cooked perfectly, the asparagus had balsamic on it as well.. There was NOTHING wrong with the service or the meal.

My wife had the mixed grill that consisted of filet medallions, crab cake and scallops. All were excellent. I had the 16oz New York strip...cooked to perfection and had a great taste. We shared a baked potato and grilled mushrooms. The service was outstanding, the atmosphere was excellent. My only complaint was the waiter took away the football the hostess gave me on the way in. Apparently, the menu was printed on the football, that has since been replaced with real menu, but still carry on the tradition.",

    "text": "For my husband's birthday, I wanted to treat him with something special in the way of dinner, so we made reservations at Shula's. I had mentioned in passing at the time I made the reservations that it was my husband's birthday.  When we arrived, we were escorted to a little alcove with a nameplate that said \"Happy Birthday\" on it. Very neat. Our waitress was awesome! We never had to ask for refills which is a huge thing with me.  For the food, mostly it was wonderful with one small exception (which is why this isn't a five-star review).  We started with the BBQ Shrimp (with stuffed basil) as an appetizer. It was delicious! Highly recommend this appetizer.  Next up, we shared a Caesar salad. We told the waitress we were going to share the salad so we were a little surprised when it was brought out to us on one plate with a spare plate to shovel half of it on to... why couldn't they have done this for us to spare us the mess on the table? Anyway, Caesar salad was tasty - not the best (see The Grapevine in Scottsdale), but very good.   For our entrees, I got the 8oz filet and the birthday boy got the cowboy steak - we both requested Medium which was described as a warm pink. My filet came out as a medium-well - no pink. Husband's steak came out a bit more on the red side than warm pink. Odd since we both requested Medium and they came out so different. Husband's steak was FABULOUS - deliciously seasoned and melt in your mouth bliss!! Mine, if it had been medium, I imagine it would have also been fabulous, but as it was, it was good. I decided not to send it back because I didn't want to have to eat it after Husband was already done with his dinner.  We also shared the crab mac-and-cheese side which was VERY good. I highly recommend this side dish. My only nitpick on it is that it was a little oversalted, but this might not bother others - I just happen to not like salt very much.  For dessert, they treated us to the 7-layer chocolate cake. Warning... this cake is unbelievably rich so prepare yourself if you order it. It came with a strawberry sitting in strawberry sauce. The only thing that could have made this better would have been if the strawberry sauce had been drizzled over the cake.   Overall, a wonderfully romantic dinner with my Husband on his birthday. Excellent service. The food was VERY good with the exception of the uneven cooking of the steaks.",

My bf got the crab cake, but I didn't try it.  The steaks are tender and cooked well.  The creamed spinach is delish, but a little skimpy on the serving size.  The lobster mashed potatoes are just okay -- mashed potatoes doused in lobster bisque and topped off with some small chunks of lobster.  The lobster mashed potatoes at City Hall are waaaaaay better, but they also cost $30 versus $12, so I guess you get what you pay for.  The drinks are strong -- especially the dragonberry mojito, which is more like a martini.  It's really good and really strong!  Lastly, I thought the servers were all very attentive and wonderfully pleasant!",

Neither was delivered.  730pm reservations and seated promptly. It was a long time to get drinks, long time to place the order, and even longer to get the food. From order to arrival it was roughly an hour.  We had one waiter and it seemed that he had no help for 12 people. Average ticket for dinner was in excess of $150 with of course the mandatory tip.  Ahi was very good, Ribeye was below average but cooked well. Cut had grizzle and seasoning was weak. Crab Mac & cheese was good.  Sat with empty drinks several times and the long wait for food seemed to be a management issue.",

Food was very good, steak was cooked to perfection (I ordered medium rare).  Price for the steak was a reasonable $40 based on other steakhouses in the area.  The reason I give 3 stars is that the service wasn't great.  This could be because they're new and have a few wrinkles to iron out.  I plan to go back in a couple of months to see if the service has improved.  I still prefer Durants and Donovans, however, if you're in the area or finding yourself hungry for a hunk of beef while losing money in the slot machines, spend your money upstairs at Shula's instead!",

My wife and I love steak and we have tried many of the fine steak houses around the country (Ruth Chris in several cities, John Howie in Bellevue, WA, Fletcher's in Glendale, AZ, Pappas in Houston, Chop House in Dallas, etc.).   Besides excellent steak and sides, the one thing ALL of these restaurants have in common is fantastic service and service is always something you can count on at these high end steak places.  At least that was the case until now.  Our experience at Shula's in Chandler AZ at the Wild Horse Pass Hotel & Casino was the worst service I have EVER gotten at a high end eatery.  In fact, Applebee's and Shari's provide better service than we got at Shula's.  The wait staff was inattentive at best and downright rude at worst.  The service was slow starting from the beginning, it took almost ten minutes to get our water, the review of specials was poorly handled, the ordering took forever and the overall experience was very negative.  We were never asked if we wanted an appetizer, there was a manager walking around throughout our over two hour ordeal but we were never once asked how we were doing.  The only saving grace was that the food was excellent but you would at least EXPECT that for a $50 steak.  I will NEVER go back to this or any other Shula's and will spread the word as to my very bad experience.  Very, very sad!!",

No plac or no acknowledgment.. we kept telling them but it was like nobody cared!!!

    "text": "It's been many years since I first dined at Shula's Steak House.  In particular, my first experience with this chain was at their Miami Lakes locations. We had just finished the acquisition and transition of several dozen heavy equipment dealerships all over Georgia and Florida.  To celebrate the transition of the Miami Flagship location, our team opted to dine here.  I was quite impressed with them before, and I am still impressed with them to date.   The decor of this place can be characterized as subdued elegance. Its dark woods are formal and imposing. Some would say that it is quite classy and old-world.  The colors are those that a CEO of a large corporation often chooses for his office.  Upon arrival, we were greeted by two of the most sincere and friendliest hostesses I've met in a long time. They were genuinely glad to welcome us as we arrived.  Shula's is tucked away on the second floor of the Wild Horse Pass Hotel & Casino, just to the right of the escalators. The are across the second floor lobby from Chrome.  It's not exactly easy to find, but there are sufficient enough hotel staff to guide you to this establishment.  Upon being seated, our hostess offered to procure for us our refreshments. We opted for just plain water for starters, and we were provided with two Italian mineral waters.   The wait staff were quite formal, poised, and elegant. Our waiter, although new, was well versed with the menu, and offered us several suggestions for this particular evening's meal.  We were famished, and wanted to get right to the point. My beloved wife ordered the 16 oz prime rib. I ordered the Filet Mignon Trio. We did opt to try their French Onion soup as an introduction.  The French Onion soup was as good as I've ever had. The cheese was properly heated and enveloped the top of the soup bowl without appearing to be burnt. The underlying broth and onions were quite savory. Sometimes, the broth can be too salty or overwhelming, as the mixture of both the cheese and onions battle for flavor supremacy. This one had a great balance to it.  My wife's prime rib was cooked to perfection. It was tender and scrumptious both inside and out, and the texture was delicate. Each bite, regardless of whether it was in the anterior or interior of the meat, was absolutely delectable.   My Filet Mignon Trio was quite excitingly prepared. I'm not a fan of the Blue Cheese crust version of the three, but the mixture was quite enlivening and original. My favorite of the trio was the Oscar Style. the layering of the crab cakes with the bearnaise sauce on top of the meat was just outstanding.   I would've given this a 5 star rating, but I do have two criticisms regarding our meal and the location of this restaurant:  My side asparagus, which I am very particular about, was seared to the point that it was burnt. I'm sure that it is what they intended, but the execution was not quite up to par. They overdid it on this one, and left a gritty burnt taste in my mouth that was hard to get rid of.  The next is the location. Don't get me wrong, the Wild Horse Pass seems like a top notch Hotel / Casino. So, locating Shula's within its halls is a great addition and hallmark. However, for those of us that have an aversion to the overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke upon entering, the smell detracted from our appetite. This was exacerbated by the fact that my wife's breathing issues began to manifest themselves after only a few minutes of entering the premises. It took us a 30 minutes of sitting in the front balcony for her to recover from the dreaded smoke cloud that permeated the lobby and the gambling area which we had to traverse to get to the restaurant.  Such a renowned restaurant shouldn't have to have its guests be subjected to this. You may say, what did we expect? This was a casino as well!  We have have a home and partially live in Las Vegas. We've been to the Wynn, MGM, Bellagio, Ceasar's Palace, and other hotels countless times to dine there. Somehow they have managed to eviscerate much of this prevailing and overwhelming smoke years ago, knowing that this has a negative impact on some guests.  Perhaps one day, the Wild Horse Pass can solve this as well, so as to not negatively impact such a wonderful dining establishment as Shula's.",

Came here with my company, so we had a private dining room for about 18 people.  Service was impeccable.  I had scallops.  Serving portions are large; there were 5 large scallops with family style sides of mashed potatoes, roasted brussel sprouts, asparagus.  For dessert, I chose the 7-layer chocolate cake.  Very good; not too sweet.  I would come back again as some of the other dinner selections which other colleagues had were the 22-ounce rib eye, filet mignon-all which looked ver, very good!",

We started with the calamari fries which were actually very good.  Then I had a wedge salad, which actually hit the spot.  For the main course, I got the 12 oz. filet.  Unfortunately, this was a little lacking in flavor.  There was hardly any salt, and the sauce that came with the steak was fairly bland.  For our sides we got the potatoes au gratin and the brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts was very undercooked, but the potatoes were excellent - warm with the right amount of cheese.     As it was a special occasion (we called this in advance), they brought us over a celebratory piece of cake.  This was very nice, but it would have been a little more upscale to get a piece of chocolate lava cake or cheesecake.  Or at least have a glass of champagne and let us pick our dessert.     We laughed about our experience in jest later, but I don't think we'll be spending another $180 here in the future.",

Service was very slow. 15 minutes to get our drinks. Salad, which was one of the highlights of the evening, arrived soon after we ordered but the it was probably 45 minutes for the steak to arrive. We ordered a filet which was dry and cooked a little too long. Tender but would have been flavorless had we not ordered sauce to go with it. The gratin potatoes were undercooked, would have been good had the potatoes been done.   Why didn't we send it back?  No one came to ask about the meal for at least 10 minutes. Our free dessert for our special day was ice cream with a little fresh fruit on it. Not very creative. Our wait staff came by very little to see if we needed anything. Not the type of service I expect for a high end steakhouse.",

The reason is the service.   The place was not even especially crowded yet we could not get basics like a refill on our tea/water.   Had to flag someone down to get our take home box/bag and the attitude from the female waitress was apathy at best.   Definitely got the feeling she would have liked to have been anywhere but there waiting on us.  But she is not the only one.  The section we sat in last visit the male waiter was the same way with same attitude.    Maybe indicative of general culture of management at that facility.   The steak was good and food ok.   But lots of places have good steaks and better side dishes.   Would not recommend.",

I ordered it medium. I was hungry so I ate it, but I tried to eat slow enough that I could show the waiter. However waiter didn't come check and see how our food was and by the time they did the whole table had finished their food, including me. They did give a free dessert when I told them about it, so that's something.... but I still spent $50 on a bad steak and for that price I expect perfection, this was far from it. All and all the place isn't bad, but it's also not good enough to justify the price point. I've had better for less and others that charge as much are consistently good instead of hit or miss.",

The food was good but we ended up throwing out the half steak and half lobster. That was the only thing that bothered me and why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.

I tried my wife's filet and it was just as bad. They tell you at the table the their meat is a higher grade than prime.  I don't believe it since my ribeye was also tough with no marbling.  The wedge salad was boring with a watery ranch dressing.  The green beans for just average.  Another very big disappointment was that they charged $32.00 for a wagu hamburger.  Yes you read that correctly - $32.00!!!! The 6 oz. filets were $38.00 and the 14 oz. ribeye was $43.00  Salads and sides were extra.  I could have gotten a far better meal at Texas Roadhouse for 1/3 the cost.  I will never be back.",

    "text": "This is my first check in at Shula's however ur been here a half dozen times.  In previous trips here things were stellar with zero complaints. This last trip was to celebrate my parent's birthdays.  They wanted somewhere they have never been and after talking up how great Shula's was, I was able to convince my brother's family as well as my parents to try one of the best Steak houses in the valley in my opinion.    Our service that evening was fantastic, our waiter was good and was attentive.  The party of 10 ordered water and two glasses of red wine and 4 apps.  About 15-20 mins pass and 3 of the apps come out and still no wine.  We inquire about the missing app and it's brought out, it was \"accidentally\" left off the tray   Same time the two glasses of wine finally show up.   All is well and the entrees ordered.    All of the orders consisted of ribeyes and filets and 4-5 sides. After some time, seemed to be near 30-40 mins out dinners came out and at first glance everything looked good.  Again we were missing a plate, this time a missing side that again missed being placed on the tray.    With the exception of one of the steaks, all of them were over cooked.  We all ordered out steaks either medium or medium rare.   My family decided that we would not send all of the meals back because we were going to wait another 30-40 mins and be late for our show that evening.   As we wrapped up dinner, service again was good, front of house staff was also good.   We left full but disappointed at the quality of the food for the evening.    I myself was majorly disappointed because I boasted to my family about how great Shula's is and that evening it was a huge let down.  Not being mean but the quality of how the steaks were cooked was barely better than A steak I would have at Texas Roadhouse.   At $50+ dollars a plate my family and I expected much better.  The bill totaled over $500 for the dinner, sure didn't feel like it was a 500 dollar dinner.    I'm sorry to say that my parents and brother 's family will most likely never return to Shula's. As for me and my family, I'm on the fence as well. Not sure what happened since m last visit, but i'm Leary of returning if the quality of the food is slipping.   3 stars for the service and front of house staff.  Kitchen needs some attention.    Severely disappointed.....",

    "text": "We went to Shula's for the first time to celebrate my sons 23rd birthday. It was the worst experience ever.  My husband wore a collared shirt, khaki dress pants and a dress beret. My son and I were dressed nicely as well. After the hostess seated us, she explained to my husband that they had a dress code policy that did not allow hats. While I was disturbed that this wasn't explained before we were seated, I stayed very calm and explained that we weren't aware of that but that removing his hat now would leave his hair a mess and be embarrassing. The hostess seemed to accept that explanation and left. The waitress arrived and we ordered drinks. 5 minutes later the restaurant manager arrives and repeats the policy. At this point I'm shocked that they're willing to make a scene in the dining room over a dress beret. Frankly we were better dressed than the hostess or the manager. We were not wearing tattered clothes or a sports hat with any kind of insignia on it. The dining room was not busy and I assure you those that were there did not take notice of us until the manager decided to humiliate us. Although the manager kept saying she wanted us to stay she kept repeating the policy even though I repeated what our dilemma was. After a few minutes of this we decided to leave. We will never eat at a Shulas steakhouse again.",

    "text": "Shula's does some things amazingly well, and somethings ... well ... confusing.  We had a 7:15 reservation.  We walked in the door, and there were 4 hosts there (or 3 and a manager).  Though we were here for our 10th anniversary - which I noted on our electronic reservation - we were not asked if we were celebrating anything (as I overheard someone else being asked) and it was not acknowledged in any way.    We were walked back with the host explaining the concept ('72 dolphins, here's a fake trophy, etc).  He was carrying this football and put it on the table.  More about that in a moment.    We were seated near the 'boardroom' where there was a big anniversary party going on.  I wasn't pleased with that, but it turned out somewhat OK - more on that later.  Our 3 person waitstaff was quite excellent.  I started with a Cherry Noir martini which was frekin unreal.  Best martini I've ever had.  My wife had a virgin Mojito since she's preggers.  She had lobster bisque and I started with the French Onion Soup.  Both were excellent.    The meat presentation was well rehearsed.  The talk about \"less than 1% of meat qualifies as a Shula's cut\" created a lot of expectation and anticipation on my part.  My wife chose the crab cakes and I got a Kansas City Strip.  We chose the potato gratin for our side.    The meat took a long time to come out, which was fine, as my wife and I were debating names for our so-far unnamed and unsexed (yes, we're going to find out) unborn child.    Potato Gratin was quite excellent.  Full of parm flavor.  Wife enjoyed her crab cakes - which were so large she was only able to eat one.  My steak was good ... but at $45 ... was not mind blowing.  Maybe there was too much work up to it.  Maybe I should have gotten the filet like my wife expected me too.  Who knows.  Here's what I didn't like.  Some of this falls on the restaurant, some of it falls on the people going there.  Look, I get that it's owned by Don Shula.  I know he was a coach.  But if I want to get food at a sports bar, I go to a sports bar.  This place is a monument to the man and his football, and it needs to decide if it is a high class high end steakhouse competing with Monti's, Flemings and Ruth's, or if it is a place about football.  Get rid of the 'football menu.'  It is awkward for both you and your staff.  Great, it has Don Shula's autograph on it.  Which was faded and couldn't even be read anymore.  I do not expect kitch when spending $200 on a meal.  I expect food.  GREAT food.    If you're going to come here for dinner, DON'T WEAR SHORTS.  What the hell is wrong with you.  If you bring your kid, DON'T LET THEM WEAR SANDALS.  What the hell is wrong with your parenting skills?  and DON'T LET THEM TALK ON THE DAMN PHONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DINING ROOM.  Have some damn consideration to the people around you who are spending a large chunk of money on their dining experience.    Can the restaurant do anything about this?  Sure - in your confirmation, mention your dress code.  No, I don't expect people to wear coats - this is Arizona after all.  Even resort shorts or nice jeans might be OK, but this is a special occasion place.  Have some frekin class.    The food and service are 4 -  4.5 stars, but the overall experience left me confused  and slightly annoyed.",

    "text": "Shula's Steak House in the Wild Horse pass Casino is the first of it's kind in AZ.  There are 36 others throughout the country mainly in the east.  We went on on Thursday night early enough to get in without reservations although I would suggest them otherwise.  They seemed to fill up as the night went on.  The food was good, I would have to complain that the filet I ordered med-rare, probably came out of a warming oven and was medium-well.  Good quality beef, but not hot enough for my liking.  In fact nothing on my plate was hot.  The service was impeccable and the decor is nice.   Your typical dark wood and leather.  I could do without the menu imprinted on the football placed on our table with the tee.  Both looked unsanitary to me and I had no desire to touch them or have them set on the table.   Dessert was yummy and the bread was fabulous.    If you go make sure to ask about the \"Birthday Special\" which is $80/couple and only goes through March.",

First, you're guided to your table and are stopped to look at a Superbowl Trophy along with some other awards as well as the large black and white photos of football players, most of whom are from years 20 to 30 years before most people were born who are coming through the door.  Then they seat you at a table and stick a football for you to look at that has the steak menu.  And they point out how this football is hand-painted.  GET THAT NASTY THING OFF OF MY TABLE!  Perhaps as this restaurant is in a casino, management believes that the people walking through the door don't get out very often and are either splurging or just hit the jackpot.  But their opening is juvenile, boring and inane.  The service is oppressively overwhelming. Too many people interrupting too often.  They had tremendous problems one evening getting our check correct.  The sad part here, the REALLY sad part is the food is very good to excellent.  Their salads are top notch.  The crab patties are sensational and the filet mignon is cooked perfectly and absolutely sumptuous. It's comparably priced to Morton's or Ruth's Chris.  Just knock off the cheap theatrics!",

My husband had two lobster tails and I ordered the prime rib which was cooked perfectly to my request.  We shared a jumbo baked potato and grilled asparagus which was so tasty.

    "text": "Came here for a random date night and had an 'A-Ok' experience. Walking through the casino through a cloud of smoke (seriously, I'm not sure this place has any ventilation) wasn't appreciated but I can't really hold it against Shula's. Just not something I'd recommend other's bring a date to if they're trying to impress.   We had reservations for 6:30 and encountered some traffic on our way there so we called to let them know we'd be a few minutes late. I had a very weird conversation with someone and when I said we'd be a few minutes late, she said, okay, we'll see you at 7:30. I corrected her and said no, it would be closer to 6:45. Luckily the traffic let up a bit and we walked in at 6:40. There were three people at the hostess stand and were all working on checking in a party of 5 that took several minutes. Not a single one smiled at us as we stood there and waited, which is always a big no-no in my book, especially when you know the dinner check is going to be well over $100. We were finally acknowledged, checked in and showed to our table. I was appreciative that I didn't have to hear the football stories either.  *Date Note - Unless your date is a sports fan or you're looking for an unromantic evening, you might skip this place (I saw a few other parties that we're subjected to the stories and photo descriptions as they were making their way to the table). Maybe it floats some peoples boats, but definitely not mine.  We had the team of three different servers helping us through our dinner. While they were all pretty good, only one smiled throughout our dinner. We ordered a bottle of their moscato wine given the reasonable price of $32 for the bottle, the crabcake and wedge salad as our starters, the 12oz filet to share (medium to med-rare), the scalloped potatoes and the roasted corn for sides. Service moved fairly quickly for the steakhouse but I think it helped that we ordered everything at once. The bread we were served was pretty good. The crabcake and chutney sauce was good too. I'd never had a crabcrake and the fiance said it was probably one of the top five he's tasted. The wedge salad was standard, nothing spectacular...the same for the steak. It was cooked to a solid medium with no blood on the plate. The meat had good flavor but there was no other seasoning on it. It was accompanied by a bernause sauce that was okay, a bit heavy. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I had ordered another sauce for $2. Each side was okay, nothing spectacular in my opinion. I might go for the mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach if there is a next time. Since we shared the steak we opted for the $16 lava cake at our servers recommendation saying it was the best on the menu. If that was the best, I'd hate to try the other deserts. The presentation wasn't great. The flourless chocolate lava cake was on a plate by itself and then in two small cups were a scoop of ice cream and of their whipped cream. I though Chili's lava cake was better than this one. Its not something I order very often and I would definitely skip it the next time.  Overall, this was just an okay experience. Not somewhere I would ever take anyone to make an impression. I'd only maybe visit there if I somehow decided I could take the smoke and go gamble a bit and was in the mood for steak.",

My family and I have tried this restaurant multiple times hoping our opinion would be changed each time simply because the quality of the food is excellent. However the service has never improved. For this being a highly regarded restaurant they do not train the staff for customer service. One trip I went and the waiter almost took my head of with the player of food. The was no apology given except me ducking to avoid being hit. Later that either we had the waiter barge into table to take plates or refill drinks and never once said pardon my reach which caused everyone at the table to feel a massive invasion of privacy while eating. The second time we went we were advised there computer program was down and they would not honor our complimentary discount. They only offered us 40% of comp that we were supposed to receive. No where on the comp does it say we are subject to computer server error. On top of that when we asked to speak to a manager to dispute this, we were forced to wait 40 minutes when we were the only patrons left in the restaurant. There is no reason we should have had to wait this long when the restaurant was not busy. At this point I would never return to this restaurant solely based on the fact of the ABSOLUTE HORRENDOUS SERVICE WE RECEIVED.  I do not recommend eating here!",

We started with calamari fries. They were the best calamari I've had. Perfectly seasoned with great dipping sauces.  They were just seasoned enough without being overly salty. Our appetizer came out lightening fast. We ordered filet mignon and crab cake for the entrees along with sides of crab mac & cheese and twice baked potato. Let me start by saying that the mac & cheese was outstanding. That was definitely my favorite part of the meal. It was garlic-y, cheesy and delicious with plenty of crab chunks. The crab cakes also had a lot of crab in it unlike other places that have a lot of breading. The massive twice baked potato was good and flavorful. The filet mignon was great. Overall a splendid experience. We went a bit after they opened on a Saturday so we did not have a problem with waiting for our food to come. We'll definitely be back!",

My wife & I dined on a Saturday night where the restuarant was not even half full when we sat down. I will not name the server(Jennifer), ok maybe I will. She was friendly and a bit aloof. Everything was timed well until we finished out salads. It took our entrees an hour to come out after our salad dishes were cleared away. When I questioned her 45 min in she said that her assistant had the kitchen beeper and tried to blame the lenth of time on her...really! No apology, no dessert is on us, just finger pointing at her underling. When I am spending $247 before tip on dinner, this is clearly unacceptable. Normally at nicer restaurants I tend to tip at around 25%, not today...15% and she did not deserve that. I may be back to Shula's, I may not...the management needs to spend more time at getting service up to speed. They deserved 2.5 stars, but I gave them the benefit of doubt.",

If start by saying that if you are planning to have an experience rather than a quick bite to eat Shulas exceeds.  I was not sure what to expect when we walked in.  My husband and I had never been before.  The hostess greeted us as well as a \"Maitre D\" and the bartender.  We were quickly seated and given a lovely presentation of the Shulas sporting memorabilia.  (My husband was quite surprised by this!) at the table we were serviced by what appeared to be an entire team of individuals who were all very courteous and knowledgable of the menu and offerings etc.  By the way, the presentation of the \"menu\" on the cart was quick and insightful as I had no idea what efforts are placed into procuring beef of that quality!   To our delight, our entire 4 course meal came as if it was timed perfectly. The appetizers, soup, main course, and desert were exceptionally good! I had the Lobster Bisque and the filet with a twice baked potato. Let me tell you, portions are not small and we were advised of this beforehand...just couldn't resist and had some to take home.  The Carrot Cake was delightful and even larger than I had hoped, but still...that travelled home easily too.    All in all, this place gets my highest regards for fine dining without being stuffy.  It's an upscale atmosphere with a casual feel. Highly recommending reservations but give it a chance.  I think you'll be impressed too!",

    "text": "Oh look!  It's me eating at another steakhouse in a casino!  Shocking (insert sarcasm here).  :-)    Went to Shula's with another couple to engage in some steak eating and cocktails, followed by some blackjack.  Casino host was kind enough to leave us a comp for the entire meal.  For appetizers we had the calamari fries and the tenderloin tips.  Tenderloin tips are amazing!!  We all ordered steaks (3 of us had the 8 oz filet, 1 had the rib eye).  My steak was not cooked properly but I was so hungry I didn't wan to send it back and wait while everyone else was eating!  I ordered it medium rare plus and it was more medium plus.  Not pink in the center really at all.  The side dishes were delicious (baked potato, crab mac and cheese, fries and au gratin potatoes - can you say carb overload?  HA HA!).  We did not get dessert because we were too full.  The service overall was pretty good.  So why the 3 star rating?  I feel like the food is mediocre for the price.  Prices are expensive for what you get.  If you are going to the casino and can get a comp for this place, then I'd say go for it.  Otherwise, choose another steak house with comparable food and lower prices.",

Brian and Lana were our servers and we couldn't have had better service.  They were appropriately attentive and provided us with information and options throughout the meal.  We both had the mixed grill which was amazing if you can't decide between filet and seafood.  We also ordered a twice baked potato as a side.  Did I mention the bread?  We could have  made a meal on that alone!  We have eaten here several times and have always had memorable food and service.  We couldn't have selected a better place to celebrate our 10th anniversary!",

    "text": "Ate at Shulas last night and it was disappointing right away.  There were 4 of us and the server addressed the men and not the women... not a good start.  We had 2 kc steaks, 1 filet and 1 shula cut porterhouse $45.  All the steaks were good except for my porterhorse and I do mean horse.  I don't know if I've ever had a piece of meet so tough.  The problem is the chef or manager never came over to look at and or to discuss the problem.  The server acknowledged how tough it was apologized and offered a free piece of cake.  If I wanted cake I would have ordered cake.  Anyway... they bring us our bill and it was $464.  They overcharged us $130.00.  They added another filet, another baked potato, an asparagus and they thought they would charge me for 2 porterhouse steaks since I didn't like the one I was served.  After about 30 minutes of trying to figure out our bill and the manager still not showing up, I demanded they remove the porterhouse which they finally did.  Very disappointing night for an expensive restaurant.  We won't be back.  Aside from our disappointing dinner the ambience is not very good.  We've been to Ditkas which is a sports themed steakhouse and it was great.  Shulas not so much.  Bypass this spot as you won't miss much.  Go to Flemings or Mastros instead.",

    "text": "The steaks at Shula's are delicious. I had the filet with a blue cheese crust, and for the thickness, it was done perfectly medium-rare.   The cut and flavor were excellent, and I liked that they have you cut in and verify that it's done to your liking.  The sides were standard steakhouse fare, and were just fine. The dessert was the same.  The reason for 3 stars is the service. Speed is not a virtue at Shula's, and, while you don't want to be rushed, taking 3 hours for dinner leaves long gaps where you start losing your appetite and getting tired.   This is compounded by the fact that the waiters disappear for long periods, and you're left with no drink. I spent the majority of the dinner with an empty glass.",

I like Ruth Chris steak better but the shrimp scampi and side dishes were superior in flavor, texture and presentation. The atmosphere was livlier and not stuffy like a Ruth Chris.

We were here for Mother's day and I was given a beautiful red rose. I would choose this over Ruth Chris.",

There were four of us in our party 2 had French onion soup super tasty, some of us had salad, Delish!  We had steaks they were good. The au gratin potatoes were great and so was the crab Mac n cheese.  The deserts were also great. I did not rate this place 5 stars because, the steaks were good and yes, I would totally go back but the steak was not above and beyond. I've had similar quality, and I have had better. You should try this place it was a great experience! The service was awesome! I was slightly put off by the bar tender, I arrived before my party and I ordered a Shulas 52 martini. I do not love gin but it's ok so, I asked if he would make it with vodka? He was like it will change the whole drink - I would recommend it how it is. So I just ordered it! It was good, not spectacular. I guess I was just annoyed he did not want to do what I preferred. Minus that snaphfu a solid four stars! Alfredo did a great job as our server I give him 5 stars.",

Ordered another beer, the server dumped it into my glass without even picking it up, let alone tipping it. One big glass of foam. Salads came, we had to ask for bread. My oysters were unbelievably gritty. The side of spinach was so over seasoned with garlic that it was inedible.

Went there last night and I ordered the Christmas special, 3 other people were at the table ordered off the menu, it took forever between the appetizer and the main course for the meal to arrive.  When we received the food it was over cooked, cold dry for 3 out of 4 people.  This tells me that they forgot or something happened to the forth entree to cause them to fire it again.  So the other three meals sat and died but they served it anyway.  The calamari was the best ever, but everything was inedible after that.  The waiter forgot my salad, never asked us if we wanted an appetizer, I had to stop him and order it myself.  He never offered more drinks or asked us how the meal was, then blamed it on being too busy.  I sent my dried out cold steak back and didn't have anything else.  I doubt I will give them another chance, as they failed at every level.  Three of us complained of cold food, they took off only 2 meals, the whole thing should have been comped as they ruined our Christmas dinner.  Update:  The fact that the management did not even respond to a 1 star review speak volumes about their commitment to service and food quality!",

Afraid of most restaurant wine prices? The prices here are some of the most reasonable I've seen. I'd definitely return just for the wine list.   We got a small tour of the photos, with the replica trophy pointed out. A little strange, but not the super-weird experience some others mentioned.   I started off with the French onion soup. Stellar. For an entree, I had their lamb porterhouse. Five stars. Our server got out his nifty little penlight and had us check the temperature before he left the table. Two thumbs up there. It was perfectly medium rare. That they have a lamb steak makes me incredibly happy, and the wine-mint glaze that accompanies said lamb is divine.   The sides didn't wow me. Three stars. The crab mac was definitely tasty, but I guess I was expecting big chunks of crab, which I never found. Plenty of crab flavor; I just had different expectations, I suppose. The grilled asparagus was also good, but nothing I couldn't make at home. The green beans were probably my fave. The citrus glaze and julienned peppers were an awesome combination. They were a little sweet for Dad, but I was pleased.   I was too stuffed for dessert, so I can't chime in there.   Possibly the most impressive part of our night was the service. I came in with my dad, who was visiting from 3000 miles away. Neither of us had ever been to a Shula's. When the floor manager, Jon, heard that it was a treat for us, he made sure we were more than taken care of. Or perhaps their service really is that amazing. Either way, five stars plus.   Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Mostly. I'll be back.",

I am allergic to seafood so we did not order an appetizer but asked if we could have bread with our drinks. He refused to bring it and said it comes later. My husband had to ask for a refill on coffee and the food was average at best. My steak was overdone but no one checked on us to see how it was. Shula's was my pick this year for our anniversary.

    "text": "After hearing great things about the steaks for several years we chose to go to Shula's on a Monday night. Thought was Monday would be a slower night there and we wouldn't be rushed.  Started out great, got right in without a reservation! Seated us in a nice corner booth.  Server went over the menu and showed the steak samples. We selected the $59 special which seemed to be a deal. Appetizer ordered was the calamari - real good and enough for 4 people. Then there was a long wait with nothing going on. My water was getting refilled seemed like every time someone walked by, but my wife's tea was empty the entire meal. Finally refilled when she set it on the edge of the table. (This was about the time we had finished the meal. )Then a large party showed up (which the waitress had mentioned) and it seemed like the attention to serve us dropped from a 7 to about a 2 on the 10 scale.   Still waiting!!   And then.... Our meal shows up!!   WHAT ABOUT THE SALADS?   We asked the waitress? Oh, you didn't get your salads she responded! No waitress we didn't get the salads. At which time she asked - do you want me to bring them now? NO! To late! She really didn't respond like a upper end establishment waitress should respond. Ran off like she was going to talk to management , manager did show up and acted like he wasn't aware of the SALAD issue. He reviewed the special flyer for the special and said he would make an adjustment on the bill.   Yes- there was an adjustment BUT we will never return to this place. Service really did suck! And the big party bill was more important then our little order of 2 specials. I also feel since we never order alcohol drinks we get slighted on good service as the waiters start to tally this isn't going to be a big bill since the alcohol is absent from the total bill!  DONE! Not going back!",

Food here was good and we all enjoyed a nice meal with a few bottles of Joel Gott 815!",

We didn't get bread until after the oysters and we didn't get the horseradish we requested twice. My girlfriends soda was not supposed to be diet. And, although other tables around us got the meat presentation, we did not?? I was looking forward to a nice steak and it was disappointing. Dry, little flavor and warm at best. I was mocked for ordering the steak fries as a side and it turned out to be the best thing on the table..sadly it took ten minutes and multiple requests to get some ketchup.  Unless you're over 50, a fervent Nascar fan or want to play the $25 high roller tables, I would steer clear of Wild Horse Pass. Somehow it managed to bring the level of this steakhouse way down.",

    "text": "I absolutely agree with the composite 3.5 star rating and most of the recent reviews of good, not great, food and Mike P's comment about rating Shula's on overall value...because it's over-priced compared to other high-end steak houses.  This was our first visit to a Shula's Steak House and our expectation was that it would be comparable to Ruth Chris or Morton's but probably short of our favorite, Steak 44 at 44th & Camelback.   Specifically, my wife loved her lobster bisque, ribeye and creme brulee trio.  She would rate Shula's with 5 stars.  I, on the other hand, thought my wedge salad was good and my ribeye was OK but a bit on the chewy side...not as tender and flavorful as hers, apparently.  All in all, 3.5 is fair but honestly I'd go 4 stars if the prices were more reasonable.  Shula's markets itself as a 5 star steak house but falls a bit short in my estimation.  In it's defense, the decor and the service are every bit 5 star.   But be warned this restaurant is inside a casino and the blast of nicotine, as you enter the casino to reach the restaurant, is disgusting if you're not or have ever been a smoker.",

    "text": "Shula's was an almost five star place. With the exception of the scallops, everyone really loved the food. All the sides were excellent. We had six people, four steaks, crab cakes and scallops. The ambience was warm and romantic. The service was four star. Just short of excellent.   The less than five stars is for little things. The meal was over 600$. To be expected. BUT.... when you're spending that kind of money on a meal it's really the details that make the difference. Details like... I asked if they could take our coats. we were in a long awkward booth with no room between us at all. The waiter said \"we don't have anywhere to put them\".  Huh? We're in one of the highest end restaurants in the area and you're just going to say \"no\" to taking coats? Find somewhere.    We had my 85 year old disabled father in law with us. The table had a big step up and was terribly awkward for him. I'd asked prior to being seated if they could better accommodate and was told \"that's all we have\". Huh? Figure it out. He's elderly and disabled and we're about to pay a huge bill in your place. I saw tables they could have put  together that would have been accommodating.   Last but not least. While the scallops tasted delicious (I ate one before almost breaking teeth on the sand) they were to sandy to eat. The waiter said \"I'm sorry\" and that's it. No offer of a desert, no taking it off the menu. No manager came by to say \"hey can we do something different\". Just... \"we cooked an inedible meal, oh well\".   I'd give it 3 stars for lack of accommodation in a super pricey place, but the majority of the meals were to good for that.",

Had a party of 7 we split the check with cash and two cards. The waiter pocked the cash and charged one card for the right amount and the other for the remainder. We had to solicit the manager, director, to sort things out and never saw the waiter again. So, after we thought that it was resolved the two people who had cards and only signed for a specific amount,  where charged THE ENTIRE bill plus the bills we signed. Which only means they ran cards twice. Fraud! So we paid $1355.65 for a dinner that was only $560.65! Thank God we caught it and were able to dispute. All I am saying is be aware! These people are CROOKS! Completely unethical business practices!",

    "text": "I reserved a large group for my husbands birthday.  Phil Perry reached out to confirm the details and provide options for our group. There was a mis-communication about having a cake prepared or bringing one in (which they do not allow) -but Phil was diligent in providing the details to have the cake made onsite, even though it was the day before the event.  We had several modifications to the number in our party, up to and including the day of the event. Phil was so attentive, provided his cell number so I could text with updates, and was very quick to respond that he had everything handled. Phil had offered the option of reserving a private dining area for our group, which we chose not to do, as we were not sure of the number or the budget of our guests. We agreed to dine in the main dining room. When we arrived, Phil had taken it upon himself to provide the private room, anyways, at no extra charge! Amazing!  I cannot recommend Shula's and Phil enough, in planning your next event!   The food is a bit pricey, depending on your choice. Several of our guests got a dinner special for $60.00, which included filet mignon, a side vegetable, and dessert. Very reasonable. Others decided to order from the regular menu, also. Though we had several \"frugal\" friends in our party, not ONE of them complained about the price vs quality of their meal at Shula's. Well worth the money.   Our wait staff was professional, but seemed cold. The primary server did not seem interested in our party at all, but seemed like he didn't really want to be there. By all means professional, just not much personality. He did his job, and did it well, no complaints, per se.   The cake was prepared exactly as requested and was decorated beautifully. Though it was the only thing I felt perhaps wasn't worth the $50.00 price tag..as far as quality. The convenience, late notice, and customization made it well worth it!  Thank you, Phil, and Shula's!!  We will be back!",

That started this  experience. Cold shellfish platter was brought to the table was still frozen with ice. Had absolutely no flavor. The calamari saved this disaster it was great. The buratta salad was spot on. The steaks came from prison and took two bites gave up. Took the steak to go for the dogs. Now comes the worst of it. THE SIDES holy crap were these bad! The corn was as dry as the desert we live in must of been sitting in a well for weeks, the potato gratin was swimming in i don't what not even brown on top, asparagus was not cooked served with a canned Hollandaise. To end our meal the chocolate souffle cake on top served with a liquid what on the bottom. I would take this off the menu because this place has no idea how to bake it. The best part of this was a complaint from me to management. What they gave me was a hundred dollar gift certificate to come back. What? Now why would I want to come back? Do yourself a favor and dine at the Capital Grille unbelievably the best steak house ever at any location.",

We had the scallops appetizer, the lamb porterhouse, the 24oz porterhouse, and the catch of the day with was Norwegian salmon and Chili-lain Bass. The scallops (2) were a little overcooked and too salty, but the porterhouses were cooked perfectly and were nice and tender, so was the fish. The portions were small and tasty, but the flavors were basic and nothing too creative. For dessert we had the creme brulee trio and the souffle, and they brought us the chocolate cake because the souffle fell the first time. The dessert again were ok, but the chocolate cake was dense and bitter. It's a good place to go once in a while, especially if you have food credit from the casino.",

    "text": "First off, I have to say, I was born and bred in Miami, FL.  So, the Shula's concept brings back some wonderful childhood memories of attending the Miami Dolphins games with my family.  I've also been to the original Shula's in Miami Lakes when they first opened, and a number of times after that.  So, the football theme doesn't bother me at all, like some others that have left reviews.  This was actually the 3rd time we've been to this Shula's, and the first 2 times were as wonderful as this time was.  We were staying at the Wild Horse Pass Hotel for the night after catching a show.  We weren't sure what we'd be in the mood for after the show, so we decided to play it by ear.  After having a fantastic time at the show, we realized it could only be made that much better by having dinner at Shula's.  We didn't  have a reservation, and this being a Friday night, we weren't sure if there might be a wait.  It was about 10pm and the restaurant was crowded when we arrived.  We told the hostess we didn't have a reservation, but she said we could be seated momentarily, and we were.  The hostess was very friendly, as was our 3-person waitstaff.  Our drink orders were taken immediately, then we were given the steak presentation.  I pretty much already knew what I was gonna have, but my husband was still on the fence.  The service was slow and steady, just as it should be when having a big meal.  We never felt rushed at all.  The bread was delicious, hot and soft.  Hubby had a caesar salad and I had the lobster bisque.  They were both outstanding!  For our main courses, he had the bone-in ribeye and I had the 8oz. filet, with sides of grilled onions (I love them on my steak) and the hashbrowns.  We both finished everything on our plates.  My filet was cooked to perfection and it melted in my mouth.  We were too full for dessert.    Overall, it was a delectably delicious meal, and I can't wait for another special occasion to head out to Chandler and visit Shula's again.",
