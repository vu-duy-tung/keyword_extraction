The girls looked cold and awkward.  Terrible initial impression.   The food was fairly average.  I've had better wedge salads, but decent attempt.  The filet was properly cooked and the twice cooked potato tasted like it should.  The restaurant was a touch dark and loud for my taste, but overall a decent ambiance.",

    "text": "We had a $50 giftcard for this restaurant so decided to check it out one evening.  We were seated immediately and first impression of the restaurant was that it was  cozy and comfortable.  A server came to a table pretty quickly and took our cocktail order.  Pricing on the drinks was rather high for the size of the drink that you get.  After looking at the menu I thought even the prices for the food was a little much for what you get.  Most of the plates do not even include a salad... It's pretty much a meat, a vegetable side for about $25-30.    After we placed our order the server took off to submit the order to the cooks and within 2 minutes she returned to inform me that they were \"out of\" the item I had selected.  I always hate that, just when you think you're gonna try something really good, they tell you that they don't have it.  I then selected my 2nd choice item but wasn't as thrilled with getting that as I was with my first choice.  The side was supposed to be asparagus.  When my plate came I had green beans on my plate.  I asked the server, \"I thought this dish came with asparagus?\"  She said, \"Oh yeah, they were out of asparagus so they substituted green beans.  Sorry but green beans are not an acceptable substitute for asparagus and went terrible with what I had ordered.  Chicken was way over cooked and terrible, not worth the $26 price.   Other things I noticed: They must have had the heat cranked up to go along with the 2 fireplaces that were burning inside. It was way too hot in there and it was cold outside.   The server informed us that if she goes missing it's because she's trying not to hover and that if we need anything we can ask another server if she's not around?!  I've never heard a server tell me that....  Most likely will never go back. It's just one of those places that you go, \"yeah seen it, ate there, won't be back.\"  Nothing impressed me and the food was terrible.",

    "text": "I took my wife out for our anniversary dinner here.  This was the first time for both of us.  The restaurant is very clean and you get a nice homey feel inside.  They have a nice sized patio if you care to eat outside.  We came in around 8:45 on a Friday night and we were seated promptly.  I started out with a Pacifico beer and my wife had a Belini from the bar.  We started out with an order of crab cakes and Mushrooms Neptune.  The Crab Cakes were very good and were filling.  You get 2 to an order and a side of their house tartar sauce that was a great accompaniment.  The Mushrooms Neptune is a mixture of cream cheese & crab stuffed inside mushrooms and baked.  These were really good as well.  You get 6 to an order.  A dinner roll came with it and I'm not sure why?  It was a plain ol' dinner roll, no butter or anything.  It really had no purpose of being there really.  For dinner I ordered the N.Y. Strip with a twice baked potato and added a lobster tail to the meal.  The steak was prepared perfectly (I ordered medium) and seasoned the way a steak should be.  The lobster tail was succulent with the drawn butter and the twice baked potato did not disappoint either.  My wife had the 10 oz. prime rib dinner (medium) with a twice baked potato and onion strings and that was out of the park as well.  The service was first class and at the end of our meal, the manager came over with 2 complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate our anniversary and I thought that was a nice touch too.  The Keg won me over and I would have no reservations going back.  The prices are a little higher than other chain steakhouses but you'll find out quickly why and it's not a bad thing.  When my father-in-law or parents come out to visit, I will definitely treat them to a wonderful dining experience.",

Their crabcakes are amazing and they're made with real crab, not the imitation crab that most places use. Their steak (Strongly recommend the New York or Baseball Top) was perfect and required absolutely no sauce to make it taste good, because it was already fantastic. Their garlic mashed potatoes were awesome and not lumpy. The wait staff was friendly, attentive, and my glass was never less than half full.  The price was a bit much, but totally worth it.   I'd strongly recommend giving this place a shot if you like steak. You won't be disappointed.",

The restaurant was a little dark and had a hard time reading the mini menu so i had to hold it by the candlelight to read it.  The bartender was prompt in greeting us and took our drink orders right away and gave us full menus in case we wanted a full meal.    I had the seafood stuffed mushrooms and crabcakes.  The food came out in no time at all and was piping hot and the waitress made sure we knew that.  The mushrooms came with a dinner roll and served in an escargot dish.  They were smothered in cheese and very tasty, the bread came in handy to each with the cheese.  The crabcakes were on the small side, thought they would be bigger for the price.  They were also nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, served with a nice caper mayo with a hint of spicy.  The squirt of lemon added the right touch.    Nice restaurant, a bit pricey but a good place for a romantic dinner.  The decor needs some work since the paintings/wall art had pictures of women's legs and people talking intimately.  Not sure what theme they were going for.",

Not sure I would eat here again as I don't think it was much better than any other chain steakhouse.  Our server was very attentive and I have no complaints there.  Where they struggled was in cooking the steaks (Not good considering it is a steakhouse).  My daughter ha the Fillet Medium and it came out Medium Well.  She thought it tasted great, so she ate it anyways, but towards the end it was dried out.  I had the 14oz Prime Rib medium rare which was closer to rare.  It was bland and tasteless. I had to load it up on horseradish (very hot) and dip it in the sauce to make it feel like I was eating something. I was planning on getting the Bone In Rib Eye but was told the Prime Rib was their specialty.  We both had the garlic mash potatoes which were fantastic.  We shared a Miner Pie which was awesome.  If the resturant was cheaper I might give it a pass, but it was not great value for the money.  They are a Steakhouse, and unfortunatley that was the one thing they did not do well.",

Both my husband and I ordered the rib steak cooked the same way. His came out about a half inch thicker than mine and perfect med rare. Mine on the other hand looked more like a pork chop. Thin and gray throughout.  Both steaks were covered in so much pepper they were hard to eat. Especially mine! We took them home and gave to dogs. Unfortunately they ate a very expensive cut of meat and not us. If it wasn't for this huge mistake everything else was definitely top quality!",

I can't see anything! It is so dark inside it's really tough to see the person across from you. At least in the lounge area. I was here around 5:30pm, and it was still very light outside, and extremely dark inside. The service in the lounge area was ok - a little slow.   Dinner service - was better than the lounge. However, I sat at a table with 7 other people and they brought 4 pieces of bread. We had to ask for more, which  seemed to frazzle the waiter a little. Serving the food was a little jumbled - one of these \"raise your hand if you ordered the Caesar salad\" type of things.   Overall, the Caesar salad was good, my sirloin steak was good - a little over-done for medium, but still good. I was pleasantly surprised.With a name like \"The Keg\" I really thought this was going to be a divey-beer joint - which it definitely is not.",

I've had steaks at Capital Grille, Fleming's and others... I was not impressed last night. We shared a NY strip with lobster tail. We had a baked potato, French fries and vegetables. The steak was dry and seemed small for the 12 oz version (6 oz at best). The lobster tail again small and unimpressive. The baked potato seemed reheated from the prior day. The fries served in a bowl were greasy as you made your way to the bottom of the bowl. The only thing I enjoyed of my dinner...the 3 dollar serving of vegetables and the free bread. Yet, I paid $69 including tip. Expensive Lesson learned.",

I don't want to have to shout at my dinner partner. I've been to better steak houses where its also loud - however the food was so divine, you don't care. When it comes to the Keg - I care. Tone it down please!",

However, the tuna I ordered was way overcooked and tasted like it had been frozen for two decades prior to cooking.  I'm bumping the rating up to 3 stars because the service was great and we had an enjoyable evening at the bar.",

    "text": "This place was not good. Only redeeming thing was the waitress. We went here for Restaurant Week and ordered the Prime Rib Oscar. Prime Rib had a very odd texture and it was hard to cut with the steak knife - and just way too much gelatinous fat. Also, not sure how bearnaise sauce and red wine au jus go together, but they don't. The combo made me feel like my palate was coated in a thin layer of vomit. Scallops and shrimp were overcooked. The earlier Wedge had very thick chunks of bleu cheese that tasted imitation at best. Twice half baked potato was decent. Desserts were uninspiring. Very obvious when someone defrosts a frozen dessert that comes in a package and tries to hide it with cherry topping. Just bad. Flemings is 10x better than this place.  Also, they have an orange slice martini that is reminiscent of a sidecar cocktail, but I would have preferred a sidecar. This cocktail was too sweet. It was like drinking a sugary, boozy glass of orange juice whilst watching your kids unwrap Christmas presents. Had that kind of feel.",

Although we went early and it wasn't busy the food took quite awhile and the chicken took longer than everything else. Both the waiter and the manager came over and apologized and it was genuine. They then brought us two desserts to make up for it which we weren't even expecting. Between the really good food and the exceptional service I know we will be back!

All jokes aside though I had an awesome experience at the Keg.  Service was exceptional from start to finish, I'm so mad I don't remember the waiter's name but he was awesome, totally attentive and made sure everything was just the way we wanted.  Since we had never been before he explained the menu to us and gave us his recommendations.  I ordered the Prime Rib Classic with garlic mashed potatos and my date got the New York Strip with the twice baked potato.  The Prime Rib was sooooo good!  It was cooked perfectly, very tender and had a great flavor!  I'm so glad I took the waiter's advice and went with that.  The garlic mashed potatos great too.  My date's steak was had a really nice flavor as well but I didn't try his potato.  For dessert we shared the Creme Brulee which was also spectacular.  The crust had a wonderful texture and flavor and the custard was the perfect compliment to it.

The steaks are also good.  I will definitely be enjoying a free sirloin on my bday.  So join the bday club here.  The chocolate martini's are amazing as well (so says my gf).  They're clear and you can't even taste the liquor, just chocolate.  It's not on their list of martini's but order it and you will have a great chocolate fix as well as get drunk.",

I ordered the bacon wrapped filet and lobster tail and he the chicken and scallops. Everything was cooked well, and the steak was seasoned perfectly. Way better than Montis steakhouse. lol. The twice baked potatoes and veggies were awesome too. The wine list is extensive, and they gave him a free billy miner pie for his bday dessert, which was delicious. We left quite happy, and we tend to be picky eaters. We will definitely go back. Prices aren't bad at all for steak My only complaint was that we got our food only a couple minutes after out appetizer arrived, not giving us any time to eat it, and the table became over crowded. The waitress did apologize but oh well.",

It was pretty awesome and cooked perfectly medium-rare. The prime ribs are decent....but pales in comparison to House of Prime Rib in SF.  I recommend getting the baked potato as a side dish and ask for the triple cheese butter. In fact, ask for extra triple cheese butter. It's that good.",

I've also had the filet mignon here a few times when we actually did dinner instead. Cocktails, appetizers, get lit and all on some 3 letter Fortune 200 company's expense account so what's not to like?

The food www amazing as well but the warmth and feeling at home feeling that Matt gave us can't be matched it was a perfect evening out and much appreciated great job! Definitely ask for Matt when making a reservation you won't be disappointed",

The food quality is great and service is great its just the little touches that make the difference. I have been going to the Keg for over 5yrs and never once had a bad experience. A few times they have over cooked or under cooked my steak or filet however they always took it back and fixed it, one time they even comped the meal for us since we had a few issues. Some of my favorite dishes are the Santa Fe Chicken Dip, the New York or the Filet both topped with their Bleu Cheese crust (its more of a bleu cheese and roasted garlic crust) and then whenever they have their Dungeness crab specials those are always good.",

    "text": "if you're looking for a really nice restaurant for a date night with amazing quality food, this is the place to go. It's a tad pricey, but more than worth it.  The lighting was dim, and we had reserved the spot next to the fireplace which made the whole setting more cozy. I can't give enough positive compliments about our server Matt and the manager Chris. Both were extremely helpful and provided really great info about the plates I had been contemplating.  We started off with the calamari which was great. Had a nice kick of heat with the jalapenos and it was paired with two dipping sauces. As for the main course, I got the filet with crumbly bleu cheese on top, grilled shrimped creole seasoned, a double baked potato with veggies and they had a ramekin of hot boiling butter and bearnaise sauce. One word, HEAVEN. My date had the prime rib with horseradish and au jus sauce, garlic whipped potatoes with veggies. Neither of us had a left-overs. The dishes were amazing.  The manager came over on multiple occasions to ensure we were enjoying our meal and greet us. I also noticed guests leaving and giving him hugs. It was great to see he had such a strong relationship with his clientele.  When it came to dessert, the manager, Chris suggested we try the key lime pie made from scratch in house with raspberry coulis and boy were there no regrets other than I was 100% stuffed. haha.  My beverage of choice that evening were the extra dirty martinis with fresh bleu cheese stuffed olives and my date had the crown and cokes. I appreciate that they put the liquor on ice and brought a small decanter of coke for him to pour at his discretion.   Again, if you're looking to have a nice dinner out or just want to treat your significant other or business partners to a nice dinner, The Keg in Chandler is a wonderful spot.   The manager appreciated all the feedback we had to give on our visit so be sure to give Chris some love while you're there as well!  We will definitely be back, sooner than later.",

The ribs and chicken have the strangest sauce, that was slathered all over the \"roasted chicken\" roasted, yes, but the addition of the mustard based sauce was a disappointment. Ribs were average. My husband asked for the prime rib sliders sans any sauce , he hates horseradish and for our second time, it came with horseradish on the buns. My son had a NY steak, he ordered it medium rare and it was  definitely a medium cook. Wine good, service great, food..... not so much. Happy hour apps and drinks are your best bet.",

Rundown of my experience:  We get to the table, our server greets us with a \"happy anniversary\" card signed by the entire staff. I think, woah! How cool!  We get our food (filets for both). They're perfect, I'm happy and full. We wait for the bill.  But wait, then another server comes from the kitchen and surprises us with a GIANT piece of what might be the most delicious cake ever, on the house, to further celebrate our anniversary. Blown away! I thought the card was a nice enough gesture.   And then, the bill comes.  A final surprise - our meal is discounted, again, in honor of our anniversary. (For those wondering; the prices are beyond reasonable for the quality and size of the meal, even without the discount).   I've never in my life been to an establishment that pulls out so many stops to make their guests experience memorable like this. I am SO blown away by their hospitality I can't even describe it.   We'll definitely be back! I highly recommend this restaurant for any special occasion - they make you feel A list!",

Instead, received (2) prime rib dinners that were at least 50% fat and gristle - not visually pleasing and not the taste of a quality prime rib.  Served with an au jus that was anything but complimenting and with horseradish that was way too hot. Comments to the waiter were met with a brush-off.  Again, not only the food served was way below scale, but so was the service attitude. Given the waiter was polite, but lacked the skill set to see what was wrong.

I've even called ahead and all they say is well we can't accommodate you until you've arrived and then they run around like a chicken with their head cut off for 10 minutes pushing together 2 tables. Pretty good prices overall though.",

When setting up nearby tables, the busboy sent the utensils crashing across the tabletops. Twice in a row, there were families who could not control their children: screaming, doing somersaults in the aisles, etc. And then to order the recommended fish that turned out to be too dry to swallow...I am really disappointed! Where is the management presence?",

Having that said, the steak is the only thing I didn't finish... I couldn't bring myself to say anything because it was free, but it was overcooked, sort of dry-chewy with too much charred goodness on the outside that overwhelmed the flavor. The veggies, shrimps, scallops, pilaf, salad, and everything else we had was delicious, but the keg is a steakhouse so......  At any rate it was a free meal so I can't really complain but the promotion did not serve its purpose because I wasn't impressed enough to get a good impression overall.   I just changed it from 2 star to three star because I just remembered the hostess was pretty damn F-I-N-E, even my girlfriend thought so.  =)",

He checked in often, presented himself very well and was attentive to our needs.  We had a bottle of Ridge that was delicious.  The brie appetizer was very good.  Now onto the steak:  Each of us ordered a bacon wrapped filet medium rare.  Unfortunately, the steak came wrapped in bacon fat and was cooked closer to rare vs medium rare.  At times I'll order my steak rare or rare + so this wasn't a problem for me, but the bacon grizzle was unappetizing.  We had the creme brulee for dessert and it was average.  The Keg does a good job, but if the could pay a little more attention to detail with respect to the food.  I think they try and turn out the food too fast and it just doesn't compare to other steak houses.  Definitely a AAA club.  If you want a real steak go to Flemings or Ruth Chris for a Big League experience.",

There was no fabulous tastes from the prime rib dinners that me or my daughter who has a bit of a culinary background (homeade cooking that is).  The reason for an actual 3-stars, is that it is a beautiful restaurant, very comfortable dining, services are wonderful, but the food just did not satisfy paying just over $100.00.  Sorry, I have had much more flavorful prime rib at Black Angus.  Save your money folks, maybe we will have to venture over to Flemings, Ruth Chris or another steakhouse for a delicious and flavorful prime rib dinner.",

    "text": "As a disclaimer, I am a vegetarian who eats seafood once in a while, but went with three people who love steaks to the Keg. We came here since a friend got a card for a free birthday steak/lobster dinner (sign up when you get the chance!) and the opportunity for free shrimp cocktail when you state it is your first time there. As a recent transplant from Boston, the chain was decently set up (although the booths were in front of a warped glass wall to the kitchen? kind of strange) and the wine list was decent. And you can cork the wine bottle to bring home-always a good option. The appetizers were good-we got the Tuna dish with sushi quality tuna and this mushroom/olive spread. The other one was warm goat cheese with almonds and a kind of tomato bruschetta like spread that tasted great with the mushroom spread. The bread plate was warm and fresh but not too exceptional. I wasn't interested in the swordfish special and the only other options were the shrimp and salmon-and I didn't order shrimp since I thought we were supposed to get free shrimp cocktail (which we never did). I ordered just a plain garden salad for 4.95 and a plain baked potato with butter and chives on the side. The other patrons ordered steaks and barely finished them or the twice baked potato. It was fine enough, but not worth busting a pants button to eat it-never a good sign. The waiter didn't offer to refill or get another beer for the people not drinking wine nor did we get mints! The service was polite but inexperienced, the ambiance was horrible with the music they were playing (some kind of 50s music with Blues Brothers soundtrack and techno? I'd take smooth jazz over that ANY DAY), the seats comfortable enough but I don't like being next to a giant Folgers coffee can through distorted glass.  Oh well, if you want a steakhouse chain, there might be a better one around?",

We were greeted at the door but the girl seemed awkward, irritated and had a bit of an attitude. We simply asked if there were any seatings near the fireplaces and she said no and then waited for us to figure out where we'd sit. We weren't inform on where we CAN sit and given that she's a hostess, shouldn't she be helping out a little? hmm  She wasn't helpful so we sat at the bar area. We had a lady grab our drink orders and then never came back to take our food orders. I mean we sat there for half an hour and we didn't get all our drinks or food ordered. We moved to the lounge area and got a new server and he was very informative, prompt, and on point. I believe his name was Bill! Awesome guy and gives great service. He definitely knows customer service. We were pleased with his attentiveness and how helpful he was.   When we got our food, we were excited considering it took about an hour and a half till everything was situated. Everybody did not enjoy their food because it was either overcooked, incredibly dry, or flavorless. I lucked out and fortunately had ordered a dish that was excellent. Their twice baked potato is delicious and the baked brie is even better!   I also want to note this was on New years day and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. There were all but 5 other groups there when we were during dinner time. We were hoping for a nice new years dinner but it was the opposite as far as my groups experience.",

Also, if anything goes awry, don't expect them to act as anything other than the chain they are. They have strict policies and no interest in going the extra mile for the customer, even if the fault is theirs.",

    "text": "We had relatives in town here in chandler for the weekend from NY and wanted to take them to a nice dinner on Friday night. I made reservations in advance for 7pm. We were all very excited about this dinner and looked forward to it. We planned on dropping about $500 for the 4 of us and going all out for this special occasion.  We show up to the restaurant at 6:55pm The hostess handed me a disk shaped buzzer and said our table would be ready momentarily. No problem . We sat in the breeze way on the benches. We waited a full hour until our table was ready ! They apologized and we were cool about it although it was very annoying because I made reservations and this was a special night for us.   The rest of our evening goes as follows.  1.)We sit down and a waiter doesn't come by to greet us for another 20 full minutes !  2.) We all four order cocktails and he stops back after 10 min to apologize that the bar is backed up and sorry for the wait. After 15 minutes 1st drinks arive.  3.) we start with two orders of tiger shrimp cocktail for the table . Those came out fast in 5-7 minutes. Only problem is our waiter only put in one order and forgot the other. We mentioned it and the second order of tiger shrimp came out after 10 min.   4.) by now we're all ready for another drink. We wait about 15 min for our waiter and eventually I get up and flag him down. He comes over and says \" what can I getcha\" we order our 2nd round of cocktails.   5.) waiter shows up 20 min later to apologize about the drink wait and asks if we're ready to order. We all want our second drink but decide to order. Two got the Filet and two got the  bone in New York that was featured. We all added the lobster tail and I added lobster and king crab legs.  6.) about 30 min later our food shows up about the same time as our second cocktail . All of our lobsters were cold and he forgot  my King Crab legs !The kitchen manager came out to apologize and comped my steak and took it away because it was incorrect .   We had a ride scheduled  to pick us up that evening because we planned on drinking a lot and eating great food for what was supposed to be a special evening but it turned out to be a disaster. I really wish we would have picked a different spot because we only see or family from NY every so often .",

Steak knife had trouble cutting through it though due to a poor choice of knives.  Had the key lime pie, good pie with a nice crust.

When I asked for it to be cooked more, the staff graciously did as I asked but when the steak came back it was burnt. Now, call me silly, but I think a place that says it's a steakhouse should be able to get medium rare right.",

I filled up on everything else so only had a very small amount of the steak and took the leftovers home. I was looking forward to eating the rest of the steak at home, but it couldn't happen.The description of the steak is that it's \"the most flavorful steak\".  I couldn't really tell because first of all it was difficult to cut and even harder to eat due to all the fat and gristle present. I was able to \"eat\" 2-3 pieces; the rest had to be thrown out because I couldn't even chew it. When a restaurant charges $32 for a steak meal, you'd think the steak would be edible. Not there; not that night.",

It has always been good steakhouse, I've never had any complaints.   Boy, have the times changed.  My fiancee had the prime rib and I had the peppercorn NY Strip. Her prime rib was not only lacking in flavor,  but extremely dry for a cut that was ordered med. rare. My NY was completely covered in burned peppercorns and the steak was very fatty. This was EASILY the worst steak that I have ever eaten.  I expected more from the Keg. We really used to enjoy dining there,  but after this experience, we won't be going back.  I would give this place a 1 star review,  but the only saving grace was the staff.  The server and food runner were very pleasant and knowledgeable.  However, whatever is going on in the kitchen nowadays really needs to be looked at.  The steaks just aren't the same and,  maybe the cooks were in or in training.  Either way,  I would recommend really focusing on QA before each entree goes out.",

The patio with the fireplace its also really nice, good for winter. But, for the rest I'm not impressed. Service was SUPER slow. I waited a long time in between salad/entree/dessert. But, I still tipped my waiter well, probably not his fault. Steak quality was good but not amazing. I got the filet mignon wrapped in bacon topped with lobster topped with asiago cheese. For a filet mignon price that compares to Flemings, it needs to match their quality. They're also rated in the same category. Fries kinda' dry, not bad but not great. Salad was good. Larger portions for sure. The browne Sunday was good but again... something you would get at BJs or Chilli's nothing special.  Again, I went to Flemings a couple of nights ago so I am comparing it to a higher up competitor but I spent the same amount of money for one person. So either lower your prices or up your quality guys.",

If you order the baked brie, nachos , or ahi tuna tacos you can't go wrong. Also, the prime rib sliders ( not on happy hour anymore) are amazing and very filling for 3 sliders!    Good selection of beers and all of their different cocktails I have tried have all tasted great. I love that anytime I order a cocktail and from different bartenders, that they always taste that they were all made exactly the same way, which I think is hard to find at bars.

This week, we decided to celebrate Valentines Day a couple of nights early, and as always had a great dining experience.  My wife enjoyed prime rib sliders, while I feasted on a perfectly prepared 12 ounce top sirloin.    On a par with the excellent food was the service provided by Rashad, our server.  Really nice guy.

While this one doesn't quite have the chill, upscale atmosphere of others, the attentive courteous staff went a long way to make up the difference. Sat in the bar area. Bartender Paul was friendly and passionate about food and drink. Made me a kickass negroni. Followed by a killer Napa Sangiovese blend.     Started off with the escargot stuffed mushrooms. Quite tasty. The kitchen tried to pawn off some kind of cafeteria roll on me. I called it out immediately. Paul was shocked and quickly brought fresh sourdough. Apparently they ran out of proper rolls and went to the grocery store for a substitute.   7 oz filet med rare. Fries. Veg. Pretty standard. I found the steak slightly undercooked, but didn't complain. This was definitely not a prime cut. Found it a bit chewy with tough strands of fat. Definitely doesn't compare to Alberta beef. And somewhat inferior to other US Keg restaurants in the US.    Overall a good dining experience. This location offers ample space, lots of bar area seating, outdoor patio with misters, and friendly atmosphere.",

After an oft delayed flight back to PHX, I was famished; in an unusual twist of the usual: \"I dunno, what do you want?\" rhetoric, we both said, \"The Keg!\" when a trip to Lush at Chandler Mall was mentioned.   We have been to The Keg several times for well executed steak/lobster dinners, enjoyed the food, service, and ambiance plenty, but it was never in my top \"must go\" picks. It is on the spendy side, but fun for special occasions or groups. We had an amazing dinner here with one of our HS buddies and his wife last year.   We enjoy Happy Hours (HH) which offer tasty food, especially small plates to share: here we enjoyed each of the dishes we had, my favorite was the baked Brie ($6) and Scott loved the baked garlic shrimp ($4) HH is 4-7PM M-S with reverse from 10PM-closing, and all day Sunday. There are beer and wine specials, and a daily cocktail @ $5. The bar is dark and swanky with a fire place and couch, and lots of hi two and four tops.   We are fans, and will return!",

    "text": "Our second visit to The Keg was on New Year's Eve.  Our first was sometime during the summer for happy hour.  It was one of those days that was seriously 113 degrees or so and I remember when I walked in to the bar I couldn't see anything.  It was so dark.  Normally I like that, but I had a hard time finding my husband.  I was thrilled when I put my hand on the right man.  My next thought was how much I liked the seating in the bar.  You can sit at the bar, they have high tops, they have cozy little seats along one wall, they have long tables for groups, and they have comfortable leather chairs along the front windows and by the fireplace.  Love the bar area.    That visit we sat at the bar and had mojitos and shared an app and the bone-in ribeye.  Had an excellent time all around.  New Year's Eve is my husband's birthday as well, and this year he wanted to come back to The Keg for dinner.  This time we sat at one of the high tops and Kennedy took great care of us.  We ordered the calamari app and 2 of the bourbon maple martinis to start.  The calamari ($11) is great.  Nice and lightly fried and they have a few fried red bell peppers and jalapenos throughout for added flavor.  Enjoyed that a lot.  The drinks are very nice and made with Woodford Reserve, I just didn't think they were a great value at 10 bucks apiece.  More like $7 or $8.  He ordered the bone-in ribeye ($36 - 20 oz) again along with the twice-baked potato.  I'm convinced that is a perfect meal.  5-star all around.  Steak was a perfect med rare and the potato was just delicious with its rich buttery, bacony flavor.  I ordered the chicken and ribs ($28) with a side of vegetables instead of the fries and slaw.  There was nothing exciting or interesting about this meal.  Very generic flavors and the ribs were not very tender.  I wish I would have gotten something else.  Next time I'll probably go back to getting a steak.  With my meal I had the Angry Orchard ginger apple cider and that was delicious.  Mr. M ordered a glass of old vine zin to have with his steak.  That was very nice as well.  Total after tax, before tip was $121.08.  We will definitely go back to The Keg, but as we get to know the menu I'm learning what to avoid.  Great place overall.",

They never refilled our drink orders, didn't clean up our spill, and whenever we asked for something they would act like they already were getting it. They were rude. Also, my steak itself was okay,  but the bacon wrapped around it was not even cooked at all. I heard this steak was yummy, yet it wasn't. Also, we were in the restaurant for 3 hours and they never really apologized for the bad service, just made excuses! It was an overall terrible experience. I only liked the bread. Even the soda had too much syrup in it. Disappointed. Don't go.",

This one one such visit and we went pretty early on a Sunday evening and it wasn't very full. There were probably only a few other people near us so it was mostly quiet, which I definitely appreciated. Only real pet peeve with this place is that is is so dark! I understand wanting to keep the atmosphere a certain way but if I can barely see the person sitting across from me it isn't working for me. Anyways, the food. My boyfriend and I each ordered a wedge salad, I had the Prime Rib and King Crab legs combo, and he got a NY Classic. The salad was crisp and nicely chilled, but the only issue was that when they had rinsed the lettuce they hadn't drained it very well and there was a lot of water in the inner layers for both of them. My boyfriend's steak was cooked to perfection and he definitely enjoyed it along with the super creamy mashed potatoes that came with it. My Prime rib was so tender it basically melted in my mouth. The crab legs were really great except for the last one which had a strange after taste. Mostly it was all good and I had Prime Rib left over, but they didn't pack up my dipping sauce in my doogy bag.",

It has always been my absolute favorite bread of any restaurant. It used to be this heavy, dense loaf of rounded bread brought in a covered basket.  Now it is a ciabatta, a squarish non dense, very huge holes and airy and light.  It is not covered and the taste is not nearly as good. Acceptable yes, but if you have ever her the previous bread you'll notice the difference. The waiter said it was changed about 6 months ago. I didn't ask about the filet. It was larger and tougher. Husband had prime rib, and his meat was a larger than normal piece as well. Not that bigger is bad, but for sure not as tender. The twice baked potato was good as usual. Overall kind of a letdown of sorts.",

Inside: Typical, classy dark-wood and stone steakhouse/wine bar decor, very nice.  Staff:  Hostess: was cheery and kind  Waitress: was experienced and efficient, our glasses never emptied our food was served in appropriate succession and we were not rushed from our booth.  Manager: very gracious, came by our table to welcome us on our first visit and offered us a  complimentary sample of their Santa Fe Chicken dip (see pics)  It was really really good, the chips were fabulous too, I think half of them were fried flour tortilla chips, I would definitely order this in its full size.  We started with a caesar salad to share and it was split in the kitchen and served to us on ice cold plates (see pics) Fresh, crisp and just the right amount of dressing it was very refreshing and perfect to share.  I ordered the Halibut and Chips(see pics) Extremely  succulent fish in a light crisp beer batter, it was so delicious it didn't even need to be dipped in tartar sauce,the fries were well seasoned with a tender crunch, perfect.  The Mr. ordered the Keg Clubhouse sandwich (see pics) Giant sandwich,He Loved it, although even his big appetite could only accommodate half.   I was really feeling good by now, everything was just delicious, I cant believe I'd never dined here before.  To top it off I ordered the Cheesecake for dessert and asked for the cherry sauce on the side Mr. doesn't like it. (see pics) WOW! So creamy and light ,the cherry sauce was a winning touch,absolutely the perfect way to end a wonderful Lunch experience.  This is now my new favorite restaurant in the mall area, and just for the record they were well on to 5 stars even if we hadn't gotten the \"first timers freebie\"  I cant wait to go back and try their dinner menu!!",

Didn't think anything of it until the manager came over and said, since it was my husbands birthday and they didn't have his first choice, his meal was on the house. Wow.. did not see that coming nor did we expect it. It was, however, very much appreciated. My husband also suffers from Celiac disease. So gluten is a big no no (they have a great GF menu btw.) After we finished our meal Bernardo comes over to us and lets us know they usually provide a dessert for customers who come in for their birthday. Let's us know what his GF choices were.

The waitress was more then helpful on explaining what temperature equals what type of cooking. When I got my steak it was cooked to perfection.

The booths and tables are big so you feel very comfortable. The bread they give you is soft and tastes great while you wait. I got a hamburger and I was very impressed how good it was. They have good fries as well. The price isn't that much higher than other places that aren't as upscale.",

    "text": "The ambiance was promising when we all arrived.  It was suggested that the prime rib would be the best option so I ordered the 7 oz, medium (using their menu-rankings and descriptions as a guide), plus the usual sides.  What I got was essentially steak tartar, with a millimeter-thick quick sear on the outside.  On first bite I wasn't sure what I was eating, so I had a second.  Then it became apparent that the middle of the steak was not only rare, it was completely raw .. basically refrigerator-cold to the tongue.  So, steak sashimi not being what I wanted I waited for the server to return.  This didn't happen so I got up and went searching through the restaurant, to no avail.  I finally just stood in the middle of a busy intersection until one passed by, and explained the situation.  He could not find our server either so agreed to take it back for 'reheating'.  A few minutes later someone higher up came and apologized and said another would would be right up.  The rest of our party continued to dine while I sat there with no dining whatsoever, no refills on water/drink etc.  About 20 minutes later my food arrived (45 mins after ordering), and everyone else was most way through theirs.    With wine glass completely empty, no service for refills forthcoming, I proceeded into steak #2 with just a glass of water.  Steak #2 was marginally better, but in lieu of medium it was just well done on the outer ring and again, all-rare tartar in the middle.  I gave up after a few bites, just surrendered the meal altogether and just went to a taco take-out on the way back to the hotel.  I didn't do an exhaustive review of the check but it did not look like anything was comped, though the restaurant put in a $25 gift card for a future visit.  This I regarded as a final insult, as I have no desire to return to this place and in lieu of making up for the bad meal and poor service, the only apparent apology is an invitation to come back and do it all over again.  I hope others have a better experience.",

They had crayons and paper for the kids. The kids had their own fancy leather bound kids menu like the grown ups. They immediately brought out water with straws and lids and then juice. They also brought out a kids starter plate with crackers, veggies and fruit (while adults figured out what to eat). They offered to bring out the kids orders early. And while we were waiting to pay they brought very small bowls of ice cream. Going out to eat with young children  always causes some anxiety (especially a nice place where people aren't necessarily expecting kids), but The Keg really went above and beyond to make my kids feel welcome and genuinely part of the dining experience.",

We were asked several times by different staff if we were celebrating anything which was nice, but they really should communicate that to one another. Our service provider was very well versed in the menu and really friendly. The food came out so fast and was cooked perfectly. We shared the calamari appetizer and they allowed us to share the salad that came with my husband's prime rib (all of it was delicious). I ordered the steak with scallops; both melted in your mouth. The margaritas were yummy too! They were having happy hour while we were there but unfortunately it does not apply to the dining room. At the end of our meal we were both too full for dessert so the manager brought us a complimentary glass of champagne for a toast! Overall, it was a wonderful place to dine with a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious quality food.",

I had only been to the Keg once before (a very long time ago) so I was very excited to try again and take my boyfriend, who had never been. We did go on a weeknight (coupon stipulation for weekends) but liked the fact that it wasn't as hectic and busy as on a weekend night. Since it was my birthday dinner, my boyfriend I got all dressed up and went out for a nice dinner.  We were seated immediately at a spacious booth next to a large fireplace. The ambience reminded me of an upscale lodge. Our server was very attentive and charismatic. He made our experience fun but not overwhelming us with unnecessary visits to our table. We were given a loaf of wonderful bread to start. Our server made awesome dinner selections, including my boyfriend's filet oscar entree. I went with the 10 oz filet mignon and a side of steamed veggies. We ordered our steaks cooked medium and medium rare. Both were cooked very well. Everything we ate was top notch!  The best part comes with dessert! The GM came over to our table and not only wished me a Happy Birthday with his adorable baby boy in his arms but gave us a free Miner Pie. OMG it was incredible!! I think the idea of giving us that kind of service was better than the actual pie for dessert.  For the food and service we received, the prices were on point. The Keg is not a cheap place but is very delicious and service was great. I will definitely return and my boyfriend even said he would return for his birthday dinner in the summertime :)",

    "text": "Headliner: Just your run of the mill steak place.  Don't bother with anything else.  The Keg is your typical steakhouse in Chandler.  There is a nice outdoors patio area and happy hour from 4pm to 7pm. There is a three course prix fixe menu for $39.95 as well as the regular menu.  The specialty is obvious on reading the menu - they put a BIG emphasis on how they prepare their steaks.  We were sat in the main dining room, and immediately served water - in wine glasses, which was kind of weird.  The bread course was a good white individual loaf - freshly baked and well executed, but really nothing special.  My dining partner, Dan, had a ceasar salad.  It was exactly what you would expect from a ceasar salad - uninspired.  The croutons at Firebirds (just round the corner) are a step above what was served here.  I had a spinach salad, with mandarin oranges, dried cranberries, pecans, red onions and the option of goat cheese or blue cheese (which was my option).  There could have been a little more dressing, and the dressing itself was a weak dressing.  THe salad was a little dry, but the components went together and were tasty.

There could have ben a little more dressing, and the dressing itself was a weak dressing. It was a little dry, but all the components were good.  I decided on a medium rare top sirloin with sweet potato fries.  The fries were nice and crispy, and there was a grilled tomato on the side with some cheese melted on top.  There was also some sort of garlic mayo type dipping sauce for the fries.  The steak was perfectly cooked.  The highlight to me was the garlic dipping sauce.  I kept going back for the fries just as an excuse to keep on dipping.  Overall, a decent place.",

I was not that hungry so I ordered an appetizer and a side for my meal, my hubby ordered the 10oz prime rib. He left with an attitude, didn't check back with us until we were on our last bites, never filled my water and when it came to dessert he asked us if we had any room left. When we said no he didn't even say that a birthday dessert was included. I urged my husband not to leave a full tip. Bill was $41.50 minus promo of $24.00 plus tax came to $18.92. He left a $8.08 tip. I hope all servers are not like Adrian, if you go ask not to sit in his section. I know someday we will return, but not to see Adrian. Very disappointed.",

    "text": "I just had one of the best dining experiences I've had in a LONG time. We went to the Keg with their birthday club coupon (see instructions below) and had a great meal for a steal of a price. I feel like I got away with something to good to be True, so much so, that I want to go back to make a deposit in my karma bank.   First of all, Keg has a great happy hour that I always seem to forget about until I go there for dinner. This time, we remembered right as we were walking in and decided to sit in the bar for dinner (good decision #2, #1 was going there in the first place).   Briana was our server and she was great! Very friendly, the perfect balance of attentive but not overly so. Never seemed like we were annoying her with our \"one more minute\" or \"on the side\" requests. Nor, did she seemed bothered by the fact that we had the email birthday coupon for a free prime rib dinner ($23 value). The best part is you don't even have to get the prime rib, you can get anything you want want and they credit your check for the $23.   Happy hour is M-F 4-7 with a few $5 appetizers, half price wines by the glass, draft beers, and $3.75 Orange Crush Martinis (one of the best martinis ever!). The only thing is that HH is only in the bar or the patio. So, if you'll take a moment to connect the dots with me, I can have dinner in the dining area and pay full price for glass of wine, or I can eat dinner in the bar and get the wine for half price. Um, I think the answer is obvious.   Dinner was great. We both ordered from the seasonal crab menu. I got the mushroom and crab crusted sirloin and the birthday boy got the sirloin topped with crab and roasted red pepper sauce. Both came with a potato side (baked for me, mashed for him). Everything was cooked perfectly to our request and so delish!   Toward the end of my meal, I reached what I like to call the \"point of no return.\" This is where there is not enough to take home, but just enough to push me over the edge of way too full if I eat it all. While I was just about to go in for it and stuff myself, Briana showed up to check on us. She easily made the decision for me and said \"Take it home!\" Maybe three to four bites of my sirloin left and she not only didn't make me feel like an idiot for wanting to save it, but she encouraged it. I heart her! Added half of the baked potato, a piece of the delicious soft bread, and the thick tomato slice garnish from the boys plate.  Plenty for lunch tomorrow!  Oh, and one more thing I love about the Keg; Keg size glasses of wine. A nine ounce pour at a great price. Perfect for two people to each get one when they want a little more than one glass, but not quite enough to finish a whole bottle! And with the 1/2 price wines by the glass during happy hour, it's AMAZING!!   OK, here is what I think you need to do.  1 - go to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkegsteakhouse.com&s=66794555b32aab85f1827396a077cd37c818a2a459d8f978a0dffb2a62a7776b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">kegsteakhouse.com</a> and sign up for their newsletter (birthday club).  2 - check your email at the beginning of the month of your birthday.  3 - go to the Keg (with the coupon, if you can wait that long, or when ever you just want a good meal)  4 - sit in the bar, M-F, from 4-7, for happy hour drinks and appetizers.  5 - if you're still hungry, order dinner and eat in the bar area, getting the best of both worlds!  6 - don't forget about the draft beers for $3, the Keg size wine pours, and the ultimate Orange Crush Martini!!!  7 - rinse and repeat, I mean go back again and again . . .   I'm going to!",

Usually we dine here for our birthdays but we recently came to celebrate a late anniversary and again, everything from the food to the service was great. I ordered the steak and lobster and my husband ordered the prime rib. My lobster was perfect but the steak was a bit tough, my husband had no complaints about his meal. I was really torn between the pistachio crusted salmon and the steak and lobster but honestly, The Keg has some of the best lobster tails I've ever eaten. Next time I'll definitely try the salmon though. The steak and lobster has literally been my go-to meal every time I've come here. With the steak entrees, it comes with your choice of side as well as green beans and red peppers. My husband always gets fries and I always get mashed potatoes. The au jus that comes with the prime rib is delicious, I make sure to steal some from my husband to put on my steak. I do think they're a little overpriced but it's nothing too crazy. The servers are always attentive and friendly and the manager makes sure to come around and see how you're doing which is always a plus. I'd definitely recommend The Keg to anyone looking to go out for a nice meal in an intimate setting.",

    "text": "I love the Keg. We visit the Gilbert location monthly. We ordered our usual sirloin oscars. There was a special or a sriracha steak with deep fried shrimp which my husband said was good. We love everything we get here. Wedge salad, lobster bisque, baked Brie, happy hour nachos. The twice baked potato is life! My only complaint is the service and perhaps the communication. The server told us the special had twice baked potato but came out with fingerling potatoes. Not a big deal, Husband just traded me. And the service. This recent trip the service was off. We don't usually wait much but this time, the server was just super busy.",

The food and service has been spot on each of the times we have gone, it's amazing.  I've dined at this particular location a few times with groups between 2-6. Their staff is always friendly and efficient with getting additional bread, drink refills, etc.  My favorite dinner items are the Keg Cesar salad to start, the Pistachio Crusted Salmon entree, and the Creme Brulee for dessert. The Keg Cesar salad always seems to be fresh & crunchy. I love the Salmon dish because the fish has a delicious crust! It is served with creamy mashed potatoes & Brussels sprouts with bacon and is topped with maple butter. I seriously drool every time I start thinking about it! No meal is complete without dessert & what better than a creamy Creme Brulee, right? The one here is perfectly decadent!  The others I've dined with have gotten the steak options & seemed to have really enjoyed them. Their main courses and sides are tasty & really filling. While not the cheap, I think The Keg is a pretty good deal!",

It can be tough to get that kind of consistency in steaks without spending $$$ at a premium steak house.   The only reason I didn't select 5 stars is the environment is a little old school. It's attractive and accommodating and also not loud which is good for being able to talk through the meal. Just lacking some updating you'd see in newer steak houses.   Still this is my go-to steakhouse in Chandler, AZ!",

I will agree with fellow yelpers that the steak was a bit tough to cut (could be a combination of the grain and dull knives) but the taste is outstanding. Food is warm and cooked to perfection. Ambiance is semi-formal but it's common to see people in shorts and tee shirts. Lighting is dim but warm. Management is proactive and accommodating. The bread is good, appetizers are good (calamari is awesome), and surf and turf is excellent.",

I like a good burger and a beer (as long as it is dark), so I thought it would be a fun way to catch-up with my out-of-town friends.  The Keg turned out to be a great Steakhouse. Way better than a sports bar. The food was fantastic. (Oh, do try the twice baked potato! A winner!) Great steaks, good salads, and veggies . . . we had asparagus and it was done perfectly! We each had the prime rib and it was melt in your mouth perfect.   And to top it all off, our service was superb. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and there when we needed her and not when we didn't.    The Keg is definitely worth a visit or two: when you have out-of-town visitors, when you need to celebrate a life event, when you are hungry for a good steak, when you need to relax over a drink and a meal  . . . . actually there are dozens of reasons to head to The Keg!",

I ordered the mondo sized prime rib with Alaskan crab legs and it was amazing! My girlfriend's steak was done to perfection as well. We had a great time and will most defiantly be back.",

    "text": "Another grand slam for steak lovers. Nestled away closer to the Chandler fashion center is the Keg. If you're a fine dinner who enjoys wine, you'll really love the extensive wine list. Your server will act almost like a sommelier. Once you've made your selection they'll almost do everything but drink it for you, heck I think they might even know what tree, fruits, or even the row the vines were grown in. It's just a really neat way to present the wine which I find interesting.  The food was wonderful along with the bread. I had a sirloin cooked to perfection and yes, of course more potatoes. The Ceaser salad rocks one of the best I've had thus far in the valley. Service is never pushy and you'll have plenty of time to enjoy your meal whether with friends, family, or if your say in the romantic mood to treat your lady friend, trust me fellas go to the Keg.

We waited in the nice bar while we waited for our table. The orange martini they have is just heaven. After a few of those down the hatch i tried a \"keg\" size glass of wine and was great as well.   This is def a steak joint, so about 90% is all about steaks but there are some salads, fish and crab options. (they are also having a lobster special right now). Lover had the prime rib and crab combo and loved it( they are apparently really known for their prime rib) i went with the crab off course and did not disappoint.   The staff was very nice and very patient and i noticed that just about everyone that works here is good looking also. just a pretty place filled with pretty people and good food!",

Regardless, I didn't think the price of their meals were too expensive for steaks and lobsters.  The Pecan Goat Cheese Sirloin was awesome!    Service is always good here.  They generally have several very attractive hostesses seating you and then your wait staff is always well dressed and attentive.  They do well with large groups!  The ambience is rustic with a steakhouse look and feel.  Not old fashion by any means, but like a maze while walking around. - Enjoy!",

Went and ordered such dinner what they forgot to tell you was that the turkey was some sort of processed mystery meat turkey roll which when sliced was both white and dark meat. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen and tasted like rubber mostly.  Can not believe they could not just roast some real turkeys and serve. That along with frozen mashed potatoes and some weird stuffing resulted in the worst Thanksgiving dinner I have ever had. In the future they should just stick with steaks and stay out of the Thanksgiving business.   Thanks Keg for making this holiday one to forget. Please close on Christmas.",

There was also a long gap between ordering and getting our food. The staff were very friendly and polite so I definitely wouldn't fault them on that, it was just very slow. The wine was very good. The steak was perfectly cooked for us (rare) and it was incredible. The best steak I've ever had. It was so succulent, tender and tasty. I love pepper sauce on steak but hardly had any on this as it seemed a shame to hide the taste of the actual steak.   This would have been 5 stars without a doubt if the service was quicker.",

When we told the waiter of course he was willing to return it but I didn't want to wait another 30 min for the correct entree to arrive. So we accepted it.  We shouldn't have.  Instead of chicken and ribs just a small chicken was served with potatoes that had a ton of bacon.  The chicken was overcooked and never in our dreams would we have ordered anything with bacon.  The place was not busy and we expected the order would be correct but it sadly wasn't.  Why wouldn't the waiter at least have offered a choice of baked potato, or sweet potato, or twice baked potato?  The salad was good and my ahi was good but the chicken plate that should have been chicken and ribs was a sad sight.  White chicken, with a big blob of white potatoes on a big white plate.  Not attractive nor did it taste good.  Not so sure we want to risk that again.",

You are open until 11pm.  The dining room was closed so we ate in the bar. ok.  Two folks at the bar and one other table of 6.    The waitress was pleasant but the service was off.  The sign at the front said to seat yourself in the bar area.  When the server approached the table, she did not have menus for us.  Asked for our drink order.  We all three wanted iced tea.  She told us that iced tea was out for the night.  What? Really?  My husband ordered a Coke....Pepsi ok...uh, no.  I will have water.  It tasted like tap water with a weird flavor...likely not R.O.  Ick.    My husband had the baseball cut steak (cooked medium rare) w/wedge salad and twice baked potato.  His steak was under done but he ate it and didn't mention it to the server.    My son had a burger (medium rare) with french fries.  It also came with a little red cole slaw.  He was happy with all of his food.  I ordered a small filet (medium rare) w/wedge salad.  My steak and my husbands steak both came with green beans and roast red pepper which were very good.  My steak was very good and cooked as ordered.  However, they wrapped it with bacon which was extremely under cooked.  Also, when the two wedge salads come out, my husbands was on a plate and mine was in a weird small bowl which made it hard to eat.  If this sounds like I am being picky, I am.  A person pays a little more to eat at the Keg.  We felt like, yea we are open, kind of.",

I'm glad to say things are just how I remembered.   Came here on a Tuesday evening, which happened to be game 1 of the World Series (BOS best LA 8-4), just in case you were wondering.   I got cozy at the bar, was promptly acknowledged by the bartender (Matt). Super cool dude. Wasn't going to drink but mainly ordered food. Glanced over the menu and settled on the 6oz top sirloin and Alaskan king crab with asparagus.   I received some FRESH sourdough bread and butter to starts things off. You can never go wrong with the fluffiness of fresh bread. Shortly after my meal came out, it was presented well; I was just hoping that it tasted as good as it looked.... and from the star rating you can probably tell that it held up nicely.   Nice plump cut off beef, all tender and juicy (medium rare of course) and chunks of king crab. I wasn't disappointed AT ALL! I pretty much cleared the plate down to the last tiny piece. It was good!!!   There are many things on their menu that I'm sure would be tasty and given the chance I would try all of them lol. Matt was dope as well, great conversationalist... especially as he was explaining some things about the company and how they take care of their people. I can dig that. If you're in the area, I would say definitely check them out.",

I brought my cousins here to celebrate their birthdays and since it was my first time also it would be great to try out the restaurant because I love a great steak.   The host was great he explained to menu well and made sure we had enough time to view the menu and even welcomed us to the state.   We started with crab cakes for the table myself the carrot which is to die for, I'm sorry this cake puts the cheese cake factory and claim jumpers carrot cake to shame.   We all ordered steaks, my steak was so tough I was choking while chewing, my cousins steak was not medium rare enough and the third steak was okay. The two of us you might as well say left whole steaks to be thrown away. The third steak since this was her first time trying steak she didn't know what to expect as far as tenderness.   118 dollars for a meal at this place I'm sorry not worth it. I've had better steaks prepared at claim numbers and much bigger in size.   I don't even know if I'll return for the carrot cake which was almost as good as mine.",

When we entered, they asked if we were celebrating, and we informed them of both events.  The service was impeccable and he actually asked me if I knew of the free birthday meal (that's unheard of!), which was the reason we were there.   The steak was perfectly cooked. At some of these chain steak restaurants, the steak is artificially tenderized. None of that here. Top notch, flavorful, perfectly cooked medium rare steak with tasty sides and perfect service.   We wish we lived nearby, because this would become our go-to celebration location.   I got my meal for free because of the birthday coupon. But, since we were also celebrating our anniversary, they offered us champagne. We don't drink, so they gave us a free dessert.  I have never experienced such amazing service where they are going above and beyond to make a celebration extra special.",

The cheesecake is absolutely my favorite. I definitely have a good selection of wine although there aren't many they are very high-quality wines that they do serve.  Lobster is always perfect.   They also have a rotating special/chefs plate situation that changes every day and is super exciting to try something new that isn't on the menu.   I just don't think I like how busy it gets sometimes. And for as much as I'm paying I'm hoping to have the steak taste a little bit better and done exactly how I ordered it.   Sometimes I have found that it's a little more cooked than I knew wanted it to be. Are usually like it on the rare side, cooked less... But it seems like I always tend to get myself a little more on the medium two all the way don but it seems like I always tend to get my steak a little more on the medium side. It's just kind of disappointing sometimes.  Overall experience is fantastic I go back every couple months because I love it so much here!",

The bartender is a pro, very clear about what they offer and handled the crowd by himself . We had the Nachos , total surprise how big the plate was, thoughtful layering of cheese , good ingredients, oh and large side salsa, sour cream, guacamole.  I had the amazing burger, my wife had Caesar and added Grilled chicken (not on menu so ask) So glad we ordered the super(likely unhealthy) but, delicious creamed spinach . The music isn't as hip as it used to be, does nobody integrate Cocteau twins anymore but still very current. Good job Keg. Come try them again if you haven't been in awhile.",

Our server was a young guy. I got the feeling he was new, he seemed uncomfortable but was friendly.  We ordered a margarita and a Cosmo. Waiter asked if the Cosmo was on the rocks, clearly he knows nothing about cocktails.  Husband ordered sirloin seafood. I had filet mignon.  Server brought me the wrong food. Claims he misunderstood. Food was corrected quickly. but I do feel him  listening to what I ordered was his main purpose as the server.  Our food was good, I especially like there twice baked potato, however the Caesar salad lacked dressing. For the prices at this restaurant, make sure your trainers are doing a good job training the servers before they let them work independently. I do feel the server will not make it and is not right for the job.",

Dinner started off on the wrong foot when we called for a reservation and were told 8:15 was the soonest available, started looking for options and found a book on line option on their website,well we were able to book at 7:30? Seems odd butt we went for it and showed up early ready for dinner,hostess tells me well it will be late as we're busy? What's the sense of a reservation if it mans we get to you when we feel like it? At least that's the way the snooty hostess made me feel. Ok so we sat in the bar waiting for our table and decided if there that busy we would just stay there, I asked the waitress if the full menu was available and she assured me yes we were good to go. We orders our meals and proceed to wait and wait until finally our food showed up, we this is where it really went south!  My wife's steak was well to sum it up to tough to cut or eat to say. The least, we finally flagged down our waitress after a long delay and explained the problem, she agreed and offered to replace the steak on the Fly, her words not mine, my wife switched to prime rib as it is already one just needs to be sliced and plated well thirty minutes  later no prime rib, no waitress or anything else, after a long wait and attempts to catch someone with no success we decided to call it a night and move on. At this point the manager came over and apologized for the way dinner went and offered to take off her meal, well this is ok since she didn't eat it? Long story short this is out second consecutive issue with ''this restaurant and all be our last, in the past we always had great service and excellent food s we spent all special ovations there, unfortunately we will NEVER go back due to the poor service and disappointing food on consecutive occasions.",

It might be bread, bernaise sauce or butter. I have to be sure to check before I leave and get home because once I'm home and digging in I don't want to go back out especially now because of being hugely pregnant.

    "text": "My wife and I stopped in on a Friday night. The parking lot was packed but they also share the lot with a Chili's. We were told the wait would be about 10 minutes which it was. Like an earlier review, the female servers were in skimpy tight black dresses, something like you would see in a chain breastaurant; tacky.  We sat at the bar for our wait and was acknowledged by the bartender right away and were served our drinks quickly. Some of the wall \"art\" reminded me of posters I used to have as a teen in the 80s. Time to enter this century, folks.  After sitting, our server Matt was professional as professional can be. Because this was our first visit, he explained to us how the different cuts of meat were prepared and would taste. Upon seating we were given a fresh roll of bread; it had a grainy taste but maybe that was the intent and that was the only roll we ever saw. The fried calamari was good as were the dipping sauces. I had the New York strip and garlic mashed potatoes. The plate also came with a few roasted green beans and red and yellow pepper slices. The garlic mashed potatoes were a little thin meaning kind of soupy but tasted well enough. Surprising for a steak place, my serrated knife was dull. I switched out my knife with my wife's, whose wasn't much sharper. I struggled cutting through the sinews of my steak.  All in all it was good service, the food tasted good enough, but with the dated wall decor and breastaurant style uniforms, the $75 tab for the two of us seems, well, overpriced.",

It's sad to say, but my steamed asparagus was the best part of the meal. I had a Caesar salad, prime rib, and steamed asparagus. My boyfriend had the bacon wrapped chicken. The seasoning was not consistent across the different foods on the plate, too salty or too bland. I was saddened with how much we paid for such a disappointing meal, but you live and learn. I'll very likely never go back.",

If you sign up on their website, they will send you a certificate for $25.00 off one of the best dinners you will ever have. So we got the full works, starters, dinners, a bottle of wine and dessert. French onion soup to start. Fantastic, we have been here a few times before and knew this was a winner. Next I had the steak and Crab legs, and T the Filet mingon and lobster. Also wonderful. The bread was even good at this place. After a wonderful dinner,we thought we would have dessert. Major dissapointment! I got the chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream. It was a cheap Ice Cream, almost like an Ice milk, and the Brownie had no flavor. T got the Key lime pie.  She said it tasted like she made it herself from a keebler pie crust.  She gave me a taste and it was awfully sweet,Both came with canned whipped cream. It was a wonderful dinner just spoiled by the dessert. Next time eat everything just not the dessert portion of it. Just skip it. Our experiance was good other wise. Our server was a little pre occupied with the table next to us. She knew them( one of them worked there or used to). So she was busy talking to them. luckily we were not in a hurry.  Still a good place, been here a few times and will come back for sure.",

I'm sure there are plenty I just run in to them every once in a rare while.  The Keg is one of them.  Two stories:  The first time I went here my friend and I just wanted a good steak so we searched out yelp and found The Keg was close.  Right off the bat I noticed the atmosphere was pretty nice, nothing over the top, but enjoyable.  I also noticed that the wait staff knew their shit.  Our waitress explained all the specials and recommended her favorites without hesitation.  The real highlight was before our food came when the manager came over and asked us if it was our first time.  He then brought us a shrimp cocktail on the house to kick off our meal.    The second visit was for a friend's birthday.  We ordered a round of chocolate cake shots and the manager showed up to mix them himself and bought us our first round.  He also gave us each recipes to take home with us.   The food on both occasions was great, I haven't had a good cut of meat like it since I left the midwest.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive, and I will definitely be going back.",

I didn't ask to speak with Carlos, the Chandler manager, until after my husband and I were done eating so I could see how the experience was before they knew the complainer was in. I have to say it was a completely opposite experience than the last time! We were cheerfully greeted and seated as soon as we entered. Our server Maria was great! She acknowledged us right after we sat down and told us about the menu and took our drink orders. She answered all of our questions and made sure my water was always topped off. The food was excellent. Perfectly cooked and tasted so good. My husband and I were both very pleased that they took it above and beyond to make sure their customers are happy.

Let me back up for a moment and say that they have a really good wine selection...I was impressed.  I can't remember what I had, but I remember being impressed!  I had their wedge salad and my husband had the Caesar...both excellent.  My husband had the sirloin Oscar for dinner and they had a salmon Oscar that night that I had....can I say how RICH that dish was!?  The topping is seafood and Bearnaise sauce.  Sooo good.

We were one of the youngest tables there. The crowd were more in their mid 50s to 60s. The atmosphere is not there.   We were seated in the corner and the spotlight above us was out. So we were relying on the 2 tea candles to see our menu and food. The light that was stuck by the corner didn't help either. The Mr took out his blackberry for light to see the menu.  For it to be called \"The Keg\" we were really disappointed in the beer selection. We were expecting more variety of beers, and they didn't even have Heifenweiser. The Mr ordered a Blue Moon.  Between the 5 of us, 2 ordered the sirloin,  top sirloin, prime ribs and chicken. When our food arrived, it was lukewarm. The Mr and I had the same order. I ordered my steak medium well but it was well done. Everything was very flavorful, but when it started getting cold the food became really salty. The bread that comes in the beginning, isn't all that great. It's just regular bread.  Our service was mediocore. He wasn't very attentive to our needs, such as refilling our water, beer, or pepsi. It was a busy night, but he hardly ever checked up on us. By the time he returned with a pitcher of water asking if we wanted a refill, we were getting ready to leave.",

    "text": "Amazing!  From the moment I walked into the door I was greeted by the Hostess with a very warm smile and immediately you felt that you were in a great place. Our waiter was genuine and was happy to answer any questions that we had about the menu. He was very knowledgeable of the wine selection helping me to pick a wine to my exact liking. Never have I been so impressed with the service provided to me. Towards the end of our dinner I asked to speak the manager to offer all our compliments that we had for the the service we received. The manager received our compliments genuinely and we could tell that he was thankful for hearing everything we had to say.  The food was great. I could not have asked for more. The quality and taste of everything we had made me think that we were paying way too less. Overall, I can say that i will be returning to the Keg as often I possibly can and would recommend this establishment to anyone!",

    "text": "First off, best service I have ever had at a restaurant. I know it's not the MOST expensive steakhouse in the Phoenix area but  I've been to two locations (Chandler and Scottsdale) in the Phoenix metro area a number of times each and have NEVER had a rude server. They are always polite, prompt and accurate with the order. The atmosphere is very nice as well. Very clean restaurant (even the restrooms) and relaxing, romantic lighting and sound level. For the west coast, great Lobster in my opinion. Not dry and they serve the butter over a small flame to keep it warm. The steak is the best or second best I've ever had. Not dry either and very tender. Melts in your mouth! Take it or leave it, a great steakhouse experience for the money. To give you an idea, it will cost apx $100 or more for two people but well worth it if you consider other competitors are about $60 for two people and the food well below the standards this place carries. A must try for anybody that enjoys a nice atmosphere and a good steak and Lobster.....",

    "text": "This is my second time visiting The Keg. Once in Tempe and once in Chandler...this was the most recent visit.   I was fairly disappointed with the Chandler location vs the Tempe location. I had the same meal at both locations a year apart with the use of the Restaurant week menu. I had the lettuce wedge, prime rib Oscar, and the miners pie for dessert (all for $44). The lettuce wedge was yummy. Bacon, ranch, and lettuce. Next came the prime rib Oscar... Which also had asparagus, scallops, and shrimp. I had some stomach issues afterwards, probably from the hollandaise sauce.   Was able to take the dessert they offered home with the deal. It was delicious and the highlight of the otherwise disappointing meal. Oreo crumb bottom, mocha ice cream, and almonds.   This visit to the Chandler location was disappointing, if I was to visit the Keg again (for their dessert) I'd definitely go to the Tempe location.",

    "text": "The Keg to me is the middle ground when it comes to steaks. They are less expensive than Durant's/Fleming's but more expensive than Outback/Texas Roadhouse. Likewise their steaks are less tasty than Durant's/Fleming's but more expensive than Outback/Texas Roadhouse.  With that said, each of the aforementioned places has their positives and negatives. Durants is really pricey but they very well may have the best steak in town to go along with their interesting atmosphere. You can cowboy it up at Texas Roadhouse where throwing peanut shells on the floor is allowed/encouraged. Fleming's is that classy place where you have a whole slew of wines to chose from to have with your supper.  So to take it all in and get the happy medium I think that is The Keg. The steaks are really good there. I would put them on par with Fleming's but obviously not as expensive. Neither myself or the girlfriend has had a complaint about the steak there. The price isn't too hateful there either. And the atmosphere can be as good or better than Fleming's depending where you are. The only thing Fleming's is going to have over the Keg in service is that at the Keg you will have one server that handles everything. Versus Fleming's where you very well may have three servers - one for drinks, one for orders, and one for food (you may not, but I've had special people come and only pour wine, etc). Fleming's isn't quite at the Delmonico's level (Vegas) as far as service.  Really, for the money I think the Keg is the best. Food is great as is service. If you sign up with them then you get deals on occasion (like your birthday, free meal).",

    "text": "Grandma C's Birthday dinner. Her Bday is on Christmas eve. She loves The Keg so we knew long ago we were taking her here for her Bday. Since I made reservations awhile ago, we were sat upon arriving by the hostess who made polite conversation as we walked to our table.  Our server was Kody. He did a great job. He was pleasant, didn't bother us and was around when appropriate. Another great thing about The Keg is that the staff/servers are there to help. We asked a few different servers for things and instead of passing the inquiry off to Kody, they handled it themselves. Awesome way to train your staff. Honestly, the service was flawless. (That's a rarity in this business)  I ordered Baked Brie ($11) & Calamari ($11) to start. The baked Brie is exactly what it sounds like. A small wheel of Brie baked served with a basil pesto and red pepper jelly and sliced crostini. The only negative here is that the app does not come with enough crostini. Not an issue though because we asked Kody for more and he brought us out enough additional slices to finish the Brie. The Calamari is nicely fried and served with both a spicy sweet ginger garlic sauce and a Greek feta sauce. The Calamari was also perfect but we all found the fried Jalapeno slices as unnecessary.  C ordered the Kids 6oz Sirloin ($15). Cooked a perfect Medium, he devoured it without a hitch. His order came with fries and an ice cream sundae which were also a hit with C.  K ordered the 14oz Prime Rib ($35). She said the meat was perfect as were the sides she ordered.  The Bday girl Grandma C had the 10oz Prime Rib ($31). As with K's, the cut was cooked perfectly and Grandma C said her sides were also perfect.  I ordered the 12oz New York ($36). A perfect Medium Rare but my cut was a bit tough and had a lot more fat that I feel should have been trimmed before cooking. My sides were also deelish.  Since it was a birthday celebration, we all ordered dessert. C's entree came with a small Sundae but it was perfect for a 10 year old. Grandma C & K both ordered the Creme Brulee. They did a great job with this. The caramelized sugar crust was perfect as was the custard. I ordered the Billy Miner Pie. Seriously, death by scrumptiousness. Mocha ice cream on a chocolate crust with hot fudge, caramel and almonds. Mud pie nirvana.   Exemplary service. Great Food. Fair prices for this level of service / food. 5 Star.",

Kind of cheesy but it is the little added touches like that that make places like this stand out above the rest.   We ordered the bacon wrapped scallops as an app as we do every time we come here because they are awesome and we are never disappointed; and again this was the case.  Jen and I both ordered prime rib. Key factor when ordering prime rib, always ask why they started cooking it.  Any place that serves prime rib for lunch doesn't slow coom it to perfection and you are most likely getting good yesterday's left overs. The Keg starts early in the morning and the prime was delicious.  Served at the exact mid rare specifications we ordered it at. The au jus was great.  After the meal the manager brought us a free dessert, not a scoop of ice cream with whipped cream, a real dessert off their menu, and wished me a Happy Birthday thanking us for choosing The Keg to spend my birthday at.  Additionally, our server was very good.  Attentive the right amount and possessed what I like to call \"silent service\".  Not every visit to our table was an interruption. He was great.   I have to say I have not checked in nor written a review every time we have dined here and want to stress that I have yet to have anything less than a great experience here in every category each and every time we have came here.  I love this place.",

Evidently the restaurant manager was at the front hostess section.  He was engaged in a conversation with my mother about seating and reservations when another customer that had previously been seated approached him.  He interrupted his conversation and gave his full attention totally to the other guest.  He left my mother standing there in the middle of the conversation and walked off to assist the other guest.  Rude, rude, rude.  Obviously, she was ready to walk out.  She had definitely been insulted.  We did get seated and the person who seated us apologized for the manager.  That's when we discovered it was the manager.  The food was awesome and the service good but a black cloud continued to hang over the evening.",

Every other experience here before had been a 4 star or better, but that was years ago.  Also know that the restaurant had people, but was not busy at all on the bar side.  The restaurant side was reservation only for lunch and had people, but not busy as well.  I unfortunately forgot our server's name, but she was a 20 something female.  She was quick to great us with waters.  When we were not ordering alcohol that is when things took a turn.  She took a bit to bring the iced teas out & did not bring sweetener.  My father had to ask several times before we received it.  When she finally took our order that was the death blow.  We ordered three wedge salads & I had the sirloin added to mine. We have a big, early Thanksgiving dinner and did not want to get stuffed.  After that we could not get her to come by for anything.  We had to ask other servers for drink refills (I hate doing that).  After about 45 minute wait for our salads (mind you the place was not busy), we received my mom's wedge, mine with the sirloin, but my dad's was missing.  She forgot to ring his up.  So the food runner got his within 5 minutes, amazing how quickly they can get them out when stuff is messed up.  Going back to the food drop, we all still had empty drinks & no silverware.  When they brought our silverware out, they never brought out a steak knife; I had to ask for that as well.    Finally the taste of the food. The lettuce was super wet, so much so that the dressing wouldn't stick.  My steak was almost room temp and the steak knife had a hard time cutting through it.    My dad got a little snarky and made a comment about how bad things were to one of the other servers trying to help out. Alexa, the manager, finally stopped by.  She asked us how everything was going, mom & dad started going off.  I stopped them and spoke calmly to her.  She ended up apologizing for things not being great and comped our meal (for three it probably was $40).  She did a 4-1/2 star job.  The server was so bad & the food was not good, that I could not justify over a 2 star rating.   Will I be back?  I will give them another shot when I am in town since the other experiences have been 4 star or better.",

    "text": "Kudos to the keg! I decided to give the place one more try and it has changed considerably over the past year, no doubt due to a new manager. The service was fast and our waiter Jay was very attentive. The food was cooked properly and exactly the way we ordered it. Jay told me that the new manager had fired a number of incompetent waiters over the past year, which accounts for the improvement in service. I give the place four stars because the prices are still too high for the quality of the food. Overall a good experience!",

We ordered wine and another waiter came by to talk wine as well, so we had plenty of positive feedback and support.  He even recommended another wine they said was popular and went to get a sample for us to taste.  I ordered the New York medium rare, it came out medium.  However I usually have to figure out how a place cooks when you travel as much as I do, as some regions have slightly different standards due to the expectations of the local clientele.  Next time I would order it rare, and they gave me a pile of asparagus, so there was no lacking of veggies.  Atmosphere was good, and we were able to hold a conversation without having to speak loudly to be heard.  We were seated immediately upon arrival, and we did have a reservation.  I booked through opentable.",

Good wine by the glass selection.  I enjoyed the Caesar dressing!  Great flavor.  The croutons were not bad but added nothing but crunch.  They could have had some S&P but even better if they carried the garlic.  The bread was ok but not remarkable. Just a very pleasant dining experience.",

    "text": "If you come to this location, Brandon is a fantastic server! Personable, quick, knows his menu.  The Arizona Restaurant Week prix fixe menu is a deal!   My husband had the Baked Garlic Shrimp, the 20oz Rib Steak, Twice Baked Potato side, and Carrot Cake - which isn't on the prix fixe menu but since they were out of creme brulee they opened up the dessert choices.  I had the Baked Garlic Shrimp, Prime Rib Oscar, Baked Potato, and Brownie Sundae - also not a prix fixe dessert.  The garlic shrimp is good, but we both agreed it would have been better without the cheese. The shrimp is in individual containers; the bowl makes me think of an egg poaching dish. The sweet roll to sop up the garlic and melted butter left in the cups is tasty and a smart addition.   My prime rib was fantastic, perfectly cooked with a hearty au jus. I would NOT get it oscar style again though. The scallop, shrimp, and aspagus were perfectly cooked in a delicious hollandaise. The only issue was it didn't 'go' with the prime rib flavor to me. Both were good separate, but should stay that way. The potato was a standard baked potato, small, and more places really need to learn to be like Black Angus and salt the outside for fluffier potatoes.   My husband's Rib Steak was juicy and perfectly cooked. It had great flavor. The Twice Baked Potato was fantastic. Large, and oh so delicious! I don't usually like Twice Baked potatoes, but I will definitely get that in the future.   Dessert, oh dessert. We were both pretty full by this time, but it was included. I was sad not to b able to try the creme brulee, but what I got was good! I don't usually like vanilla ice cream, but Haagen daz!  The brownies were tasty, and oh so decadent. I would definitely get that again. My husband said the carrot cake was moist, sweet and delicious. I don't like carrot cake but can't say anything bad about my bite.   Overall I'm glad we gave the Keg a second chance, especially this location. Our experience at the Tempe Marketplace location was not nearly as good.  This is definitely going in our date night rotation! Thanks Brandon, and everyone else at the Keg :)",

Sat at the bar, mind you this is a bar...and I was there for drinks and appetizers. I was a little disappointed. The bar was seriously dark and you had to use the light on your cell phone to help light up the menu's or use the candle that was propping up the menu to give you some back light to read the menu. This may have been romantic had I been seated in the dining area and on date. But I was thirsty and wanted and drink to top off my wonderful day Saturday out and about in Scottsdale.  The place had TV's to occupy the view. Otherwise on the walls were a bunch of art work of ladies legs or a couple embracing. Not sure what the theme of this art work was supposed to represent. I know that this is a Steakhouse and Bar but the pictures on the wall for some reason didn't quite fit image for me.   Drinks prices and appetizer prices were a bit on the high end. Although they did taste good.   The bar area also had a lounge like area with a couch and cozy setting.   This place would be worth a try again sometime.",

    "text": "I think the quality has decreased in the last three years. My fiance and I ate dinner here the other night and we felt like for the price, we did not experience an outstanding meal.   For example the butter that they bring with the bread is not real butter. It's that with stuff that seems to have some type of canola oil added to it. The texture of the bread was nice but it's not sourdough and really didn't have much flavor.   I asked for with a salad with dressing on the side it came on the top. They fixed it but again attention to detail when I'm spending $28 for meal is important.   They made my fiance old-fashioned incorrectly.   They were able to fix it but it still didn't taste right. I think they added simple syrup. It  had a strange sweet flavor to it.   My fiance did enjoy his meal they cooked a steak the way he wanted it and they left off the butter on his vegetables because he has a dairy allergy so that was good.   My steak however was well done and I did not ask for it well done. The flavoring and seasoning was good though.   Again for the amount of money we paid for that meal it definitely was not worth it. In my opinion the keg is just another one of those chain restaurants that charges a lot of money pretending to be a fancy restaurant and it's just average. There are many other options out there for a nice steak dinner where attention to detail is important.",

Our entrees were cooked exactly the way we wanted, and the meat was very tender and flavorful. Our server was very pleasant and helpful. I don't recall his name, but we told him he reminded us of Larry Fitzgerald, and he said, \"I get that a lot!\" He was very kind and attentive.  From where I sat, I could see part of the food preparation area and was impressed with how careful and clean everything appeared, and how professional the staff seemed. The management gave us a HUGE free slice of carrot cake to take home, and I must say, it was the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. It was easily enough for four people. This place is not cheap, but for this one, very special, occasion, it was perfect. Thanks to all of you for making our anniversary very memorable!",

When she made reservations she let them know it was her anniversary - when they arrived - there was a Happy Anniversary card on the table - signed by the wait staff!  It was so sweet!  Our server was on his A game for most of the service.  Very attentive for the most part - till the food came, then he kind of forgot about us.    5 of 6 people at the table ordered Prime Rib - everyone enjoyed a well cooked and succulent slab of meat!  We all got the combo that came with salad and a side.  Great meal at a great price!    The 6th person, odd man out, decided to get the 1/2 rack of ribs - he was disappointed.  The size of the 1/2 rack was more like a 1/4 rack of ribs - the bones after the meat was taken off looked like chicken wing bones... so sad.  We did get to express the concern to the manager - she was very apologetic and offered to fix the issue in several ways - bringing out another 1/2 rack or some prime rib... or even comp the meal.  Great work on her part.    My advice - stick with the steak!  Prime rib is great and so is their baseball steak - had it before!  They also usually give you a piece of cake or dessert if it is a special occasion.",

As far as what they are \"known for\" STEAK. Thumbs down! I ordered a bone in rib steak and waited over 30 min. Suzi let me know towards the end that there was a party that put in a large order and that's why it took so long. Thanks for the heads up, but the kitchen is well prepared enough to handle Wednesday night dinner traffic. My steak finally came and it was over cooked (medium well to we'll done) and I ordered medium. The veggies were soggie and bland and the mushrooms had zero flavor. I know mistakes happen, but the chefs/cooks in the back have to take more pride in what they are doing when serving food at mid-upper tier pricing. Again, my experience with the front line staff was awesome, Suzi definitely did her job, and did it well. However, the back of the house needs some work.",

Bonus, when they brought the meat back they also refilled the baked potato and green beans. Manager checked in on us, excellent management skills.  I dont get to come out to a place of this bracket often, but even with the hiccup I will come back again without a second thought. Our waiter Matthew was amazing, thorough, provided options and helped us enormously. Matthew checked back often.

I ended up having a peppercorn new york steak, which coincidentally my friend got too.  We both thought it was outstanding.  Everyone in our party enjoyed their dinner, although there was a mix-up and 3 of the dinners had to be re-done.  I'll chalk that up to a rare, honest mistake which they more than made up for.  My wife enjoyed the mini-brownie dessert.  I thought the bar was very nice and cozy.  The restaurant was very nice but not too formal, which I don't care for at all.  All-in-all a great dining experience.",

    "text": "Perfect place to sit outside, have a couple cocktails and have a great steak.  Sirloin for me. Service is top notch, prices reasonable and again the atmosphere is second to none for outdoor dining. Will always return when in Chandler.  Update: Been back two times since my intial review and I dropped it one star. The first of the last two visits they transposed the order for my wife and I for our steak, when the manager came out to speak with us and rectify this....he did the exact same thing! By the time our steaks arrived after sending them back twice, we were no longer hungry after finishing the baked potato and salad and we were running out of patience. They went good for it and reduced our bill which was nice. This last time my wife's steak came out very rare and as timing would have it,  it was the manager who checked on us just as she was first cutting into it. He took it back and again my wife worked on the baked potato and had no room left for the steak. The waitress also failed to bring out a wedge salad for one of the other guests in our party. She returned with our meals so getting a salad at that point seemed a waste. It also took some time before our drinks arrived as well.  The management again took my wifes steak off the bill and offered our two other guests a dessert for the salad mistake.  My steak was more rare than medium but I ate it anyway and it just wasn't that good, sad to say, as we really love the location and the outdoor seating. 40 minute travel from the house which we may not make again for quite a while.",

    "text": "Never, ever disappointed here. We've come back several times and I haven't written a review- WHY?!   Server was the best, pointed out the (new) appetizer he recommends the Lobster Gratine, (Oven-baked lobster meat with garlic, herbs and melted Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses).  Very yummy, but not much in quantity, delicious meat though. I suggest getting the Calamari appetizer if you're looking for a little more to eat as an appetizer (one of our favs)!  I had the Lobster Crusted Sirloin (to absoloutely DIE for, super tender, moist, flavorful, didn't even raise my hand to get the A1). I barely have to in this place.   Kris had the half lobster and steak. I've never seen any resteraunt cut a lobster in half the way that they do. No, not horizontally where the tail is separate from the head. Straight down sagittal. (Medical students, you know what I'm talkn' about!) Definitely a different cut, but he claims it's deliciousness and he dunks more pieces of it in the ramekin of hot, melted butter.  The manager also walked by and asked how we were doing, \"Great!\" we managed to say with our mouths full of food! Even baby didn't cry when he saw him.  Beautiful restaurant, great staff and unbelievable food.",

    "text": "I was surprisingly disappointed last night as my husband and I ate at The Keg for our 36th wedding anniversary.  We have eaten at The Keg before and loved it, which is why we chose to return.  We were seated at a  wonderful corner table with round seating just for the two of us.  The waitress and all other staff were efficient, courteous and friendly, yet professional.  Our issue was with the food, and specifically with our entrees.  First off, The Keg had a weird menu that night, and I think it's temporary, where the only choices were crab and steak.  I chose the Dungeness Crab ($31) and my husband had New York Steak embellished with crab and other seafood ($33).  My crab was a lot of work to crack open and all, which for some reason I just didn't remember I'd be doing that when I ordered it.  So I was up to the task, but the crab meat inside was just very mediocre and a bit discolored....measly, not plump and luscious.  The garlic potatoes accompanying my crab were dry, and I had to keep taking drinks of water between each bite.   My husband's steak was the worst.  It was tough to chew (even though it was medium rare) and seemed to be fettered with some kind of gristly meshing.  We purchase our beef from a frozen foods delivery truck to eat at home.  Our beef is at least 50 times better than what we ate at The Keg.  The Keg was aware it was our anniversary, as was our waitress, yet nothing special was done as it normally is when we go out to celebrate something special.  Usually restaurants (like Flemings, Va Bene, and Lon's) will bring a special little dessert or chocolates for us to share to commemorate the occasion.  I don't think we'll be returning to The Keg for quite awhile now.  There are so many other wonderful restaurants out there.",

Came with an appetizer of  buttered shrimp and a dessert (I ordered creme brulee but they didn't have it so I picked carrot cake).   The buttered shrimp appetizer was pretty good. The filet mignon was the best. I always get it medium rare and it always hits the spot. The shrimp and scallops were a bonus.  They didn't have the dessert I wanted but the Carrot cake (a la mode) was a big slice (like 1/4 of a regular carrot cake). I'm sure I would've gotten diabetes if I ate all of it but I took a few bites and finished the ice cream.  The price was pretty good, all of that was $39. In my opinion this is a little bit better than Mortons.",

    "text": "My husband and I have enjoyed the Keg on many occasions.  We always sit at the bar because we really enjoy the interaction of a bartender.  However, last night, we went on a date to celebrate...and something went wrong right from the beginning.  While the bartender said hello, she left us sitting there with no drink menu and no offer to get us something to drink for about five minutes.  The well was NOT slammed and there were a total of three bartenders, a bar back, and a manager behind the bar during that entire time.  I'm not usually that picky, but I felt very dismissed from the very beginning.  The bartender came back and asked if we would like something to drink and introduced herself as Katie.  She took our order and brought my husband's beer while I waited another few minutes for my glass of wine.  When she came back, she asked if we wanted appetizers.  I asked for a full menu and she went off for another five minutes, making drinks, talking with another server, and in search of menus.    Now, I know that I have higher expectations of many places (especially restaurants that charge an average of $26 a plate) and while I understand we were there at eight pm on a Saturday night, I felt really unappreciated and unwelcome.  Our food arrived in a timely manner and it was good - not great.  I took her recommendation on the steak and was disappointed - the steak had a fat marble running through it (one thing they point out not having on the front page of their menu) and they took away hubby's lobster butter before he was finished eating.  He used the bread butter for his lobster!  I mean, come on.  For an $80 meal?  Katie really redeemed herself at the end of the night.  I mentioned that I didn't care for her particular recommendation.  She offered to replace it but I really don't like to send food back unless it is awful.  She bought our two drinks to make up for it, which earned her a 30% tip.    I am usually so happy at the Keg...but this one merited a review of distaste.",

My medium rare was perfectly red throughout.  We have been to several Steakhouses over the years (Mastro's, Marco Polo Supper Club, Ruth Chris, etc) and honestly our food tonight was on par with restaurants 4 times the price.  We liked it all, the beer, the martini's, the meat, the delicious 3 cheese butter on the baked potato, the salad  and the creme bulee for dessert.  The only thing that was slightly lacking was the vegetable medley with the meal.   I'm glad we chose this over Benihana next door.   The wait staff was great and even told us about their free $23 birthday meal if you sign up for the birthday club online.  Sweet.  We will do this next year (today is my wifes birthday).

Very good value in just oz per dollar; however they also age the beef and offer 2 infrequent choices for how you would like it cooked: blue rare on one end of the spectrum and Chicago style as an oddball.  Chicago means the outside will be charred and the inside will be whatever temp you want it.  I went for Chicago rare, and it was so amazing I didn't use the onion straws or sauteed mushrooms that come with it.  I also only had a tiny bite of my twice baked which was very good, but I couldn't spare the room since its a 20 oz cut.  The tempura snap peas and asparagus were light crisp and wonderful.  The bartender was great and did well with a basil gimlet that was sweeter than I usually allow, but the agave and elderberry went really well with the citrus. Also, this place looks to require headshots from all staff when applying, but in addition to all being very attractive they all had their hustle on and were keepin the place moving.  Update: 2nd showing?  Still a mighty good steak, but much worse service.  The bartender was very concerned about closing and not so much serving me.  Guess they should've went farther than her headshot...",
