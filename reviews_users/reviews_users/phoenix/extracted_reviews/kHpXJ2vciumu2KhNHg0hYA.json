The service was OK too, but it wasn't busy at all.  There are like 50 TV's in here, so I imagine if you like a bud light and a bar to sit around and watch whatever sports there is going on, then it is the place for you. Just don't order the food.",

My biggest complaint with this restaurant was the service. When we arrived, we told the hostess that there 3 of us. She didn't even acknowledge that we had spoken and instead just walked inside expecting us to follow her in. She could have said \"okay follow me right inside.\" How simple would that have been? It just rubbed me the wrong way. Then, we ordered drinks and even though the restaurant wasn't busy, it took a long time to get our drinks. The rest of our experience was just average and I think this place has good potential if the service was better.",

We got there about 1135am, were seated quickly and it was already starting to fill up.  I love that they don't mind seperate checks because there was 4 of us. I got the Jalapeno Chili Burger with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were delicious! Not hot but warm. The burger had no sauce whatsoever on it, we had to ask for mustard and mayo. I had one skinny chili inside my burger, boo! I barely even tasted the chili. There was WAY to much bun for this burger...and I wasn't the only one who thought so. I just ate my burger with one side of a bun, my coworker was just peeling off chunks of bread from her's.  Another coworker got this tuna crossiant sandwhich...next time I'll try that. She didn't like the swiss cheese that was on it but said it was very delicious. As we left the place was packed! Well inside, they had a few patio tables, but who wants to sit outside - its hot AND windy that day.",

First we got a bomb parking spot right out the front door and it wasn't too crowded so we got a nice table and served quickly. They have happyhour until 7pm, which I love! Most place stop at 6, which sucks since most people cant make it anywhere without driving light speed before 6pm after work. So 7pm cut off for HH is a great find! Pass it on!  We ordered the boneless wings to start with half medium sauce and half of their special TD sauce, I recommend both! TD sauce is similar to Zipps Golden sauce if you know what that is like, but better. Then I got the chicken tacos, very good. Enjoyed them greatly! Exactly what I was looking for, hit the spot! Jon got some kinda spicy pasta, which when it hit the table looked amazing, however big prob, they put mushrooms in it, this isn't listed on the menu and Jon is allergic. They took care of it quickly though, remade his selection sans mushrooms and we found out it was as good as it looked.   Very nice staff, clean inside, fast service, lots of TVs.... and great happyhour specials!",

We came here during a Suns game one night, with the intention of watching the game, and since it was a big game I remember the service being slower than at other times but I didn't really care because we intended to be there a while anyway.

Service from Olivia was excellent; she kept our beverages filled and otherwise checked back often without being intrusive. Food arrived much faster than anticipated, likely because it was not a full house . . . Jared Dudley's chicken sandwich with a side salad was very tasty . . . Decided to splurge and get dessert, and the brownie sundae is highly recommended! The vanilla ice cream underneath the brownie, chocolate sauce and whipped cream is both excellent tasting and amply supplied. . . . Another great feature is that a discount card is available for the asking, which gets you 15% off your total food & beverage. Overall, a great experience!",

The atmosphere is lively enough with every sporting event showing on the multiple tvs. Service was good, and fast and efficient for the lunch crowd.  The menu consists of the usual burgers and sandwiches. My chicken sandwich was dry and uninspired. The one thing that stood out was the chunky bleu cheese dressing.

The prices were pretty high... my guess is they spike them up during the game? It's possible... Either way I wasn't really too hungry but was craving something sweet. Having saw the GCU Triple Double and being a 'lope myself I decided to try it. I also ordered a Long Island Iced Tea which was a Thursday special for $4. The dessert was $6.50. In about 2 minutes my drink was brought out to me, and about 15-20 minutes my dessert... My guess is it took a while as it is a half baked cookie and had to be baked. On top of the cookie was a few scoops of ice cream, some whipped cream, and lots of chocolate sauce (I asked for extra chocolate because.... well chocolate. Overall the dessert was great. It was a little crunch on the sides, and moist and chewy in the middle... so half baked and it was huge. I may be back again if I happen to be in the area.",

My daughter took one drink of milk and said \"mommy, I don't like this milk\" me thinking it may just be something she wasn't used to, I took a big drink. The milk was BAD! There was no doubt it was well beyond its expiration date. It was everything I could do not to get sick.  We told our server and she apologized. Then said they poured it from the bar. Like where they serve it from should change my perspective. Like because it was from the bar I should not be bothered by the fact they are ok with serving rotten milk.   The manager brought out our food and never addressed the rotten milk.  It leads me to wonder, if they don't check milk expiration dates and freshness what else do they overlook?",

    "text": "My husband ate here just after buying me a very unmistakable anniversary gift at Comicon - a black & red cloth parasol in a black drawstring bag. It didn't look like anything special when it was inside the bag but once open, it had a unique red/black pattern. He accidentally left it there, so I went back the next day and asked the ladies at the front hostess stand if they had seen it. Both of the ladies there remembered exactly what it was and one of them said they had hid it under the hostess stand for safe keeping, but it was not there. She thought maybe someone had moved it to the office so she went to check. It wasn't there either. She took my number and said someone would call me later and let me know if anyone found it. The manager called me back and told me nobody else had seen it. We went back the next day to see if anyone had found it, but still the same story.   So it was in their possession at some point and moved to a location that only the staff would have been aware of. But the manager came over and told me that \"anyone could have just seen it and taken it from under the hostess stand...\" which I find absurdly hard to believe. With as many eyes as are on the door, what are the chances of a random passerby digging around under the hostess stand without someone seeing them and saying something?   But instead of actually doing something - anything - as a gesture of good faith, they just put on a smile and say how sorry they are. Basically all I got was, sorry-not-sorry that someone on our staff probably walked away with your anniversary gift but we literally don't care. I intentionally waited to see how long it would take or if anyone would even bother to follow up with me, but apparently my personal property of extraordinary sentimental value was not worth a follow up call. My friends and I used to use this place as a hub during Comicon every year. Never again.",

I hear the beers are full tilt, but the cocktail crowd needs to stay clear of this place.",

My elderly friend fell outside the restaurant (due to the extremely high curbs) and we had about 5 staff helping out and ran to her aid.  Each helping in getting ice, towel, bandages, peroxide and assisting her in getting up.  We were very impressed with their attentiveness to her injures and never left her till she was able to get up!!    Now for the dining experience:  BLT was perfect and Customer service was superb!    Back to the staff; I can't say enough about how helpful they all were.  Kudos to the General Manager, he bandaged her up and was AWESOME!!!",

    "text": "WOOF. Terrible service. Mediocre food. One of the worst experiences I've had a restaurant in a while. And I feel validated since many other reviews are similar to mine.  Came here on a Thursday night for a college basketball game. The place was busy, as there were multiple March Madness and NBA games on, but not packed. After we were seated, we didn't see our waitress for 20 minutes and when she finally did come she asked \"if we were ok.\" Although we had gotten there in time for happy hour, we now had 5 minutes to decide before happy hour was over. This was made especially difficult because they don't have a printed happy hour menu! We asked the waitress what the specials were and she listed out each item and price (not an overarching \"$2 off apps, $3 drafts\", etc). Not sure how we (or she, for that matter) were supposed to remember the specials to order from memory.   Welp, that would be one of three total times we saw her over the course of two and half hours. At the end of our meal, it was impossible to get our check as she was nowhere to be found and the other wait staff didn't come near our table for us to ask about a check.  Food was mediocre. I got wings which I thought were pretty hard to screw up at a sports bar. But the medium wing sauce was flavorless and the chicken itself was overcooked. For $11 wings? Pass.  With so many great bars and restaurants downtown, you bet I won't be back here ever again.",

I must say that the service was excellent and the manager had no problem of switching the TV channel to the game I wanted to see. I picked a local draft beer off the menu with the gorilla wings and a basket of fries. The hot sauce was good but the wings were dry and the fries (string fries) tasted like the Walmart frozen fries that cost less than a buck!

Only downside was that I asked for a glass of water twice, but never ended up receiving it. Plus, they added 20% gratuity (vs the usually 18% that is associated with large groups). Good bang for your buck (for happy hour at least)!",

The wings were okay, but the chef really needs to work on his/her knife skills. I ordered the chicken sandwich with sprouts and avocado. It came without any other condiments. This was a problem since it was the driest piece of chicken I had EVER attempted to eat. Luckily the waitress hadn't cleared the wing plate and I was able to use the ranch to get 1/2 of my sandwich down. I would have returned it but our waitress had disappeared after my husband didn't order a second beer. Speaking of my husband, he ordered a burger that also came without condiments. He waited patiently for 15 minutes for our waitress to reappear, finally asking some other server for mayo. She also refilled our drinks. When our waitress returned with the bill and to clear the dishes no apology was made for her lack of service nor were any questions asked about the food remaining on my plate.  I would have given it one star, but they have really cold beer and great thin fries.  So, remember if like something besides catsup on your sandwiches you'd better ask, and stay away from the chicken.",

But the number one thing this bar is good for is...you guessed it! Watching the game!  Since the bar is pretty little, it does get packed, but service is usually pretty good.  There are enough TV's that you can see the action from wherever you are sitting, and you just might spot an NBA player or two while you're there.  I met Thunder Dan here myself once and might I add, he has amazingly soft hands for a man .",

Personally, I never cared for the \"owner\" when he was with the Suns, and this establishment has done nothing to change that opinion.  The food is bland at best, but for the prices it should have a little flavor.  I'm not sure what criteria the staff uses when deciding who to grace with their presence, but the female servers sure weren't responding to me (a woman) even when I held out a $20.00 - my 6'3\" friend had much better luck, he was the one that had to order my drink.    I'm disappointed, this is such an easy place to hit on a light rail pub crawl or before or after a game or concert, but I just don't think I can bring myself to go back willingly.",

    "text": "I've never been to Majerle's before a game, so this is purely a review based on numerous weekday lunch experiences. First I totally agree with previous reviews that complain about the location of the TVs. They are in such awkward spots and are only tuned to like two different things, which is semi-annoying. However I can't complain too much when one of them is tuned to Sportscenter which is all I really need as I eat my lunch. My major complaint about Majerle's is that it is a very awkward space. There is a hostess stand out front on the sidewalk but no one is ever there, so you have to walk in and then BAM you are like on top of the bar. So you're in the way while waiting for a hostess which I hate.  Other than that main complaint, I'm not going to hate too much on the food. It's a freaking sports bar. They serve sports bar food. I am not expecting five star cuisine...I just fried goodness that will clog up my ateries and beer on tap. If they have a salad or two so I can feel better about myself, great. For the most part everything I have tried has been good, including the potato skins, grilled chicken caesar wrap, fried chicken salad, kids grilled cheese meal (hey I wasn't hungry that day!) and the house salad. The french fries are really good especially dipped in ranch. The only thing I didn't really like that I have tried has been the chicken tenders. Something about them was just a bit off to me.  Prices are decent considering the proximity to US Airways Arena and Chase Field.  Overall a good lunch spot to grab a beer and get my sports fix, but not somewhere that warrants a special trip. I'll have to check it out before a game sometime to get the full effect.",

And if you're not a huge sports fan there's a good chance the person sitting next to you is someone well known in some sports league or another (you know, NBA, MLB, something like that).  I came here with a friend from out of town one night. Some college basketball game was on tv. As we enjoyed our beers and caught up on life, my friend laughed and said, \"This place seems to be popular with aging frat boys.\" I asked him what made him say that, and he pointed to some guy sitting across the bar from us. It was Dan Majerle.",

    "text": "One of the more iconic sports bars in Phoenix is Majerles. Named for and run by Dan Majerles of the Phoenix Suns, this bar sits just one block away from the arena and tends to host some of the rowdier crowds during the Suns games. Majerles is consistently ranked one of the top sports bars in the country by Sports Illustrated. This accolade is well deserved.  Majerles is small but laid out well with the bar in the center with smaller high-tops encircling it with booths along the outer wall. This system works well for the different types of crowds that come into Majerles. There is also outdoor seating and usually a scantily-clad hostess standing with them.  Nothing special about the menu but everything is good. The Chicago burger, with its blue cheese, is a personal favorite. The bar features the usual selection of domestics and imports as well as specialty liquor.  This is not really a kid-friendly environment but there is nothing to suggest they shouldn't attend. Because the bar is more intertwined with the restaurant and the waitresses are usually minimally dressed, Cooper's Town might make a better impression on the younger ones. The food is better there too.",

    "text": "Located within walking distance of Bank One Ballpark (MLB's Diamondbacks) and US Airways Center (NBA's Phoenix Suns) Majerle's (owned by three-time NBA all-star and local icon Dan Majerle) is a great place to go before and after a game.   Weekend afternoons--game day or not--are relatively quiet, which means quick service and an attentive wait staff.  And while the food is typical of most sports grills (burgers, sandwiches, and fried appetizers, for example), it's a great place to unwind or to escape the Phoenix heat.  There are the requisite large televisions tuned to the day's sporting events and plenty of memorabilia lining the walls.  Despite these sports bar staples, the place is actually quite cozy and quaint.  But while Majerle's is good in the afternoons, it absolutely rocks after Suns or D-Backs games.  The place is typically packed and it's not uncommon to find local or visiting athletes sipping beers on the narrow sidewalk patio.  The bartenders are personable and charming and it's not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well).  The spontaneity of patrons singing duets with the bartender or serenading their dates to late-'80s pop ballads makes for a great party-like atmosphere.",

The Jared Dudley, and the Joe Klein Burger. I suggest ask if they can butterfly the chicken breast on the Jared Dudley because it can be sort of thick without, and I usually ask for an extra side of blue cheese ( I like it with the fries too) adding a little more to burger. The blue cheese is really good, and the buns they use are like the Hawaiian dinner rolls everyone eats at Thanksgiving.... The meat is really good too. my favorite burger now.

If you've seen any of my other Yelp reviews, you would know that I love old buildings; and I like businesses that reuse old buildings. This one was built in the late 1800s and is one of the oldest still standing in Phoenix. Majerle's has been in the building since 1992, and that is impressive. Let's be honest, downtown Phoenix kinda really sucked in the early 90s. That they have managed to stay open for almost 20 years gets bonus points in my book.   I had the BBQ chicken wrap, some mild wings, and a beer. (Well, I split it with someone, I am watching my figure.) I liked it. I liked it more than I thought I would since it's a sports bar. And it wasn't any more expensive than any other sports bar. I really liked the exposed brick walls that echoed stories from bygone years and sighed in relief that the wrecking ball never came. Thank you to Majerle's for having vision and bringing value to downtown Phoenix.",

    "text": "It's usually a ghost town at the downtown Phoenix bars, but when a game and/or concert is happening, suddenly the bars are bustling. Such was the case last night at Majerle's, former Phoenix Suns player Dan Marjerle's sports bar. With the Beyonce concert across the street at the arena AND a D-backs game at the ball park, Phoenix was a hoppin'.  My friend and I stopped into Majerle's, which I've been to a few times before, for dinner and drinks before going to see Beyonce. I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize it's hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar I've ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL  named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if you're in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin' Friday special.  My only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show.  But I'm still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area.  HOT TIP: A second Majerle's will be opening in Chandler in the fall.",

Somewhat limited seating. We had a large group so ended up sitting outside, mind you this was summer time so very warm. There were misters on the outside patio seating area but the misters faced the sidewalk so didn't do a good job of cooling the patio area. Ordered a draft beer for $6 and a salad for $13. Yes, a salad from a sports bar. It was ok, nothing special. I would recommend this place more for the great bar ambiance.",

Granted, we were definitely seeking out chicken fingers and potato skins, but they were crispy and delicious. Thanks for the Phoenix hospitality, Majerles!",

I ordered a grilled cheese and it came with avocado and tomatoes in it. Gross! I asked the server if I could try something else and she offered to have it remade without the extra ingredients. I did not want to make a fuss because she already had her hands full with a bar full of Athletic Directors from the AD national conference so I agreed. She had it remade and it was still gross. I was very disappointed because this place was raked as a top 10 sports bar in the area. I didnt end up eating my food but somehow still had it on my receipt. I will never come back and do not recommend this place for food at all!",

I called them to check to see if they have a happy hour before going and the person I talked too said it went until 7 pm and included a whole list of things $6 apps and $3 beers. When we got there we asked if we had to sit at bar for happy hour and they said no. We sit down and ask what the happy hour is again and the waitress says we have $5 long islands...I was waiting for her to give us the rest and we got nothing from her...I asked any beers? No not right now...okay. Get our beers at regular price and then when it's time to order I ask what food is on your happy hour...nothing right now. Wth!? The staff needs to be better prepared and knowledgeable of menu and specials. We specifically went here for a happy hour and their wasn't even one! I wish we went to Zipps.  The only reason I am giving this review 2 stars is because the Mama Majerles Burger was good.",

    "text": "I went there tonight before the Suns vs. Rockets. We sat outside to watch the street crowd which was nice. The waitress took 8 mins to come and take out to even take our water order. So when she came I asked her if they had Happy Hour she said they don't have happy hour on game day. Boooooo for that.  So I ordered the Rojo chicken sandwich with mozz. Cheese with a side salad. My husband ordered a All American cheese burger with fries.  So the food came out promptly but the chicken was some thin piece of processed meat with this huge piece mozzarella cheese on it dry toasted bread with two slices of tomatoes and some dry lettuce.  My husbands burger came out dry as hell. He had to ask for mustard and mayo on the side. Terrible the waitress didn't let us know it was a dry dull burger with nothing but meat and bread. With shoestring fries the few that there were.  I then had to ask for ranch and pickles for the fakechicken sandwich.   The service was the worst I've seen in a long time. First of all the place was packed with basketball fans trying to make the start of the game. So I had to ask the hostess to take my watered down long island back and bring a bud light. Then I had to call the hostess to take the money so that we could pay and leave. She hardly checked on us outside and she knew we were sort of rushing to walk two blocks to see the beginning of the game. I only tipped $5 that was courtesy of my husband because I would have left like $2. Sorry,I'm usually a descent tipper but she was pretty awful.  I would never go back the food quality was poor and the service was even worse. Go to Hooters for a fantastic buffalo chicken sandwich.",

It seemed that the family area was completely separated from the bar area, which I liked.  They have plenty of seating but It can get very busy there on a game night. Also, parking can be a problem if you are just there for dinner and drinks. I didn't think of that and ended up paying $10 for parking.  I ordered the Long Island Iced Tea, it was very potent and tasted great, just the way it the LIIT should taste. My husband got the wings, which I didn't try but he seemed impressed. I got the fish tacos, and they were very good. The cilantro sauce that came with it was  a little thick and tasted more like ranch, but the salsa was ok.  All in all, I had a great time there and the bartenders were all very friendly and attentive.",

Eventually she took on the duty, but never introduced herself or asked us if we had ever dined there before. Khris and I looked at each other and just shrugged our shoulders and made nothing of it.  Later our waitress arrived and took our drink orders, but a pattern emerged as she also failed to tell us her name or greet is in a kind manner. When she came back we ordered our food and both chose the Sweet Cajun Burger which was amazing! The patty was spicy, the sauce was sweet, and Khris enjoy the bread the most. Though thin, the fries were very tasty and were plentiful as well.  We give the food the highest compliment, but the service was subpar. Given that it's a well known restaurant and a highlight in the downtown area, we expected a bit more.",

Our service is good and the myriad TVs to watch sports on can't be beat.   Our last meal at Majerle's was on a lazy Sunday afternoon and the service was very good. Our waitress took care of us and our food was reliable as usual.   Majerle's is a great place to hang out and watch sports or to grab a quick bite. There are other grills with better food, but Majerle's makes up for it with atmosphere.",

This place had all three, not to mention a COMPETENT staff who actually believe the customer is right.  Go figure.    I stop in across from the conference which had wrapped up earlier.  I ask about drink specials.  The bartender apologized, since she had forgotten what it was, but within a minute she told me it was strawberry vodka lemonade.  Well, that sounds fantastic.  So I had that and a strawberry fields salad, which was this glorious field of greens with strawberries, feta and walnuts, with a strawberry vinaigrette.  Oh, hell yes.  This is what mama needed.  They also understand that hey, we're like five feet away from the local sports arenas, and we're named after a local sports god, let's get some good shit up!  And lo and behold the Rangers playoff game was on.  Well all righty.  No one was moving me at that point.  I also got to try their cheese fries.  It's real cheese, but the fries were just ok.  They were the super skinny fries but the flavoring was good.    After the shitty time I had with food in this region, this place was awesome and I would just go back SPECIFICALLY for the salad, that's how good it was.",

Love the homage to TC as I'm from Michigan.   Second night we had the shrimp again ( TC style mixed with BBQ bc last night was a little spicy for me-bartender recommendation) and it was fantastic. We also ordered the prime sliders and chicken tenders. The tenders were soooooo good. Hate to use the word tender again, but that's what they were.    Service was also great.  We sat at the bar. I would absolutely recommend to anyone!",

Found a seat at the bar. The barkeeper served my favorite IPA draft beer, tenderloin sliders, and gorilla wings. Tasted delicious. Constant attentive service with a smile checking if I needed anything. All done while the bar was busy with typical Sunday Night Football crowd.  I couldn't find anything wrong with my experience, thus 5 stars. Don't let the smallish venue size (for sports bar) give you doubts.",

    "text": "I have been to Majerle's Sports Bar Grill once before, at the Desert Ridge location. Besides, the pleasing drinks and food, the customer service drew me in the most. This following weekend, I decided to try the Majerle's in Flagstaff, Arizona with a good friend.     During my day visit, I was automatically greeted by numerous employees besides the hosts. This initially told me I would most likely receive great service during the rest of my visit. My waitress w1as, as well, the bartender. She was very consisted regardless of how busy she was. When ever she may have been caught up tending to others, other waiter and/or bartenders were happy to assist and made sure there were zero need for anything.   I started off with an appetizer, Madison's skins (potato skins topped with ingredients) with chicken, replaced the bacon; which was just tasty as I expected. How can I forget to mention that we received the appetizer approx. 10 minutes after ordering, beyond how crowded it became.       While my friend and I enjoyed our starter we decided to enjoy some Tequila Tonics; and our bartender made the beverages just as we like it (chilled with lime and salt around the rim).  Shortly, after we received our entrees. I ordered ,The Lumberjack Chicken sandwich, without tomato. I must admit, I was afraid the grill chicken would turn out dry; but it was the opposite. My friend ordered, The Slam Duck Shrimp, buffalo sauce as a choice of flavor. Both entrees were fresh and warm, and they were both filling. We were obviously satisfied; and had no choice, but to enjoy the rest of our visit at this sports grill.  My experience at Sports Grill leaves me with no complaints; because overall the service was to be expected. I definitely recognized the consistent customer service, regardless, of the restaurant's location! Majerle's Sports Grill may just be one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona.",

Started with chicken nachos which was really good with the fake nacho cheese and real cheese! Lots of toppings.  We all went with burgers and I got Mama Majerle's burger (grilled mushrooms and onions with cheese) and added bacon. The burgers are huge, huge beef patty.

The shrimp tempura crust was perfect but shrimp inside was very much over cooked and flavorless. Sauce for dipping didn't help the shrimp. Hubby ordered the chicken sandwich w/ mild sauce. The sandwich was nicely made but sauce was over powering. We also got salad and fries. Both were delicious. We ordered a Blue Hawaiian and a Raspberry Lemon Drop. Both were good. Overall, we would probably come back for drinks and fries or maybe try another dish. **They gave military discount which is always kind **",

I ordered the ragin Cajun, seasoning on the chicken was good, the Cajun mayo didn't do anything to help the sandwich and the Texas sweet roll bun is to big .. after two bites of mostly bread I had to eat open face sandwich style .. shoestring fries were really good ..   Boyfriend ordered the diablo rojo, he thought the bun was to big also and after the chicken was gone he had several bites of bun left on his plate..

This is a very good choice if you're looking for a cool sports bar atmosphere before/during/or after a Suns/Dbacks game while in downtown.  The ambiance is great being dimmly lit, having exposed bricks, newer newer flat screens tv's and surround sound that really makes you feel apart of the game.    I'm only commenting this place as a bar and not on its food.  I don't think this would be in my top twenty of choices to eat at with so many other great dining choices nearby.  Only come here for the scene and the drinks, you really can't go wrong with that at Majerle's!",

Drinks are cheap.  Here's the downfall. Food didn't look appetizing. Generic food that looks as if it came from a frozen box and was heated in a microwave. Wouldn't be surprised. I would stay away from there drink specials. It may be cheap but thats because there's no alcohol! My friend ordered a blue hurricane for $4 but asked for a shot for it since there was no hint of alcohol whatsoever. With the shot it came out to $12. So much for drink specials. They ordered another drink special in hopes it would be better. Fail. Sad to say but they returned it. Stick with beer. You can't go wrong with the flavor and amount of alcohol in it",

    "text": "So I know Abu J. has given me the advice to stop going out with losers, and I have yet to take him up on his advice, but after my latest outing I think I will have to.  I was hanging out at home when I got the call to hang out with this guy for a low key night.  I had to remind him it was Monday Night Football and the NLDS game of Phillies v. Rockies.  So he suggests we hit up Majerle's, which I'm down for because it means more sport watching and less talking.  So I find my way down here, and say screw it to paying for parking.  After the whole $20 to park at Westgate, I'm down to take my chances at getting a parking ticket.  It's ridiculous how much the city makes off of parking, parking tickets, and the ever illustrious DUIs.  Anyways, I go into Majerle's, completely ignored by the hostess out front.  Glad to know she's getting paid $8.50 to not talk to anyone and act pretty...  Settle down at the bar and order a Blue Moon, because it's a Monday, it's football, it's baseball, and I'm preparing for another laborious date.  Halfway through my beer my date arrives.  Which wouldn't be cool, but I need to get good and drunk so I deal.  He automatically decides we need to get wings.  Thanks for deciding...because I have no thoughts of my own.  Apparently him being a gentleman meant he would talk shit on the wings I wanted, then reluctantly give in to getting the boneless buffalo wings.  Which are $5 along with four other appetizers during their 4-8 pm happy hour.  Good deal there!  The wings come out within 15 minutes or so and they look...odd.  It looks like someone sliced tofu and lightly fried them, then dipped them in excessive amounts of sauce.  Definitely not the most appetizing item to look at.  I wished they looked better, because then I wouldn't have the hippie making fun of me the whole time.  They tasted okay, but the look alone was too much of a turn off to enjoy.  The bartender disappeared after we ordered the wings, so we spent some time waiting for her to discover us again so we could order our entree.  Oh how I wished she had taken our order earlier.  I had to listen to the douche hippie talk smack on the Angels and how people die all the time so Adenhart's death didn't matter.  Yeah...that deserved a total smack in the face.  Or complete beat down.  Don't ever hate of my Angels or commit blasphemy against Adenhart.  I will not stand for that, especially if I've had a few drinks in me.  Anyways, so I eventually order the veggie wrap with chicken and he gets the chicken parmesan.  Not too much time passes, so I could enjoy the flat screens and watch the Dolphins show Mark Sanchez how to play a real football game.  The wrap comes, and it's huge!  I enjoyed the fruit salad of pineapple and grapes.  And the actually spinach tortilla and veggies were good, but the chicken just dragged the wrap down.  It was so bland and tasteless.  I wish I would have just gone pure veggie.  I had a couple rounds of beer after that, just to pass the time until the Dolphins could be declared the official winners.  Conversation came and went with the people at the bar, far more interesting than the person I was with.  The beers came and went, and soon it was time to peace out.  When I saw the tab, I was glad I didn't have to pay.  $60+ to \"enjoy\" conversation with a tool and overpriced food and drinks.  Sometimes it's good to be a girl...",

To give Majerle's some credit, they did actually honor their agreement to participate in the pub crawl, offering a drink special, but it turns out that the disgustingly sweet $3 Stoli strawberry lemonades were available to everyone. There were also no food samples. Why did we buy pub crawl wristbands again?   We attempted to make up for the slowly-worsening pub crawl experience by ordering vodka shots. There was some miscommunication between the bartenders because when the girl we ordered them from disappeared and another bartender approached us to ask if we needed help, we somehow ended up with two rounds of shots. Naturally, we didn't want to pay for both, a statement that got us quite a bit of attitude from the bartenders. The mistake wasn't entirely their fault (we could have been clearer, I supposed), but I could have done without the 'tude, especially since you can just pour vodka back into a bottle. No harm, no foul, right?  Anyway, I wouldn't refuse to come back to Majerle's before or after a game, but I definitely wouldn't choose over 15-20 other places in a 5-mile radius that have great food, cheaper drinks, and friendlier service.",

    "text": "I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.  Yes, Majerle's is worse.    Okay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.  The set up is terrible.  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.    Moreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.    The bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.  I wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1,000 sports bars in the US.",

It is a frequent stop for Suns employees...when we decide we can afford it or are celebrating someone's birthday. Thanks to Mr. Majerle we get a 10% discount that you can't complain about and if you ask the employees nicely, get a frequent meal club card thingy so you can at least get a free meal every once in awhile.  I admit the food is pretty bland, but it gets the job done when it comes to having only an hour-ish lunch break. I always end up getting the Amundson Chicken Sandwich or the Chicken Ceasar Wrap...mostly so I can eat those crunchy delicious fries (similar to Yard House fries if you've had those).   The service is hit or miss...but that's ok. It's what you have to expect and just deal with it.   It's always fun for us huge Suns fans to stop in there before or after the games to see some players and coaches, watch some ESPN, and have a great time.",

Walked in with a big group after the Suns game, and it was packed.  Even so, the hostesses went out of their way to find a bunch of open tables and pushed them together for us.  Service wasn't nearly as quick as I'd like, but I try to be realistic.  When you're in a crowded sports bar right after a local sporting event, it's gonna take a few minutes to get your drinks, and I'm cool with that.  After people had a couple of drinks and loosened up, the karaoke lineup was classic!!  It started off with a tiny girl singing Gin and Juice by Snoop Dogg.  Then came the Beastie Boys and Salt N Pepa.  And that was enough, I was hooked!  In the business of full disclosure, I don't think it's advertised as Hip Hop Karaoke, I think it's just referred to as karaoke.  That's just what it's become known as between me and my friends because that's all we've ever heard/sang there.  Which is awesome if you've never experienced it.  Dan Majerle and a few of the Suns rolled there after the game too which was kind of cool, added another fun dynamic to the drunken sing a long.  Didn't have a bite of food so I can't comment on that.  But I did have a hell of a time and next time I can stay out late on a Tuesday (not nearly as often as I'd like) I will definitely be back!!",

They're the smaller cut variety like those served at Steak and Shake.  On the side I was given a small cup of ranch.  Even that was good.  Not cheap watery stuff like I've been served at other places.  One pitfall to my visit was service.  It was slow despite an abundance of waitress' and not many customers.  It was Sunday morning prior to kickoff and the place was just beginning to fill up.  To make matters worse a different waitress assisted every step of the way: one took my order, one brought the food, another went for my refills.  My friend had to ask two different girls for our check.  Had I not been occupied with a game I would have been annoyed at the service quality and wait.    Majerle's should also take a look at their satellite boxes.  Two or three of their screens were frozen.  Not a good thing to have happen when folks come in to watch games.  One tv was frozen the entire duration of our stay.  Other places I've been to are always on top of malfunctions.  If you can't get one game to come in then change it to another.

    "text": "I always have a good time at Majerle's. The food is consistently good and service hasn't failed me yet. Most recently i've tried the Rojo Diablo sandwich (chicken breast fried & dipped in wing sauce of choice) with medium buffalo sauce... Yum! Nice and spicy but not torturous. Their crispy fries were good dipped in the extra sauce i got on the side too!  =)   My friends had some of the other sandwiches and the Asian Chicken salad. I got to try the salad and i may get that next time i'm there. The Asian dressing (sesame ginger) is really tasty! If you happen to be there on a day when they have Tortilla Soup, i'd recommend giving it a try too. Drinking here can get pricey; i usually only drink here during happy hour when things are cheap.  They have a bunch of tv's and offer specials during MNF too.",

I ordered the Sir Charles Chicken Sandwich, named after the Suns' legend...The food was good, just like anything you can get from a sit down restaurant and the service was great.  The waitress Leslie took good care of our group.  She knew we were visiting from California, so had some great recommendations for us.  I would come here again and I suggest you do.  Thunder Dan has a great spot; no wonder this place has been in business since 1992!!!!",

After 5 solid minutes of being passed by, I finally got my own menu. The server who FINALLY came over couldn't have been more rude and obviously didn't want to be there. The food was good, which is why it's getting any stars. The experience itself was awful! Every person working there should be fired! Even the couple sitting next to us came over on their way out to ask how our server was! They wrote her \"comment\" on their bill. Lol . If your desperate for food while downtown then go for it, but otherwise, stay away.",

The food was just alright. We got the gorilla wings with garlic and chili sauce and they were very good. They had a crispy skin and the sauce was mild but tasty. I had the sir charles chicken sandwich and it was really dry. There was too much bread and not much sauce on it. It was a very generic chicken sandwich and I would not order it again. I guess if you are looking for a sports bar, this is alright, but maybe stick to the apps.",

I will be so happy when Downtown Phoenix starts thriving to the point that restaurants decide to open their doors on Sundays (most don't). However, until that hopeful day comes, I will rely on Marjele's to feed me since they are one of the few restaurants who stay open on Sundays. Mareje's provides solid food. Food that you will know what you're getting yourself into before you get there. They also have several TVs and always provide quick and friendly service.",

It's not on the menu, but if you ask, they will make it for you. They also have daily drink specials. Last time I went, it was $4 long islands. What a deal!   The best appetizer is the buffalo shrimp. The shrimp are butterflied, slightly breaded and fried. The crunch on the shrimp is amazing. And then they are coated with just the right amount of buffalo sauce. The only downside is that you only get about 6 to an order. The loaded potato skins are very good also.",

The wait time was less then 10 minutes and the wait staff were friendly.   I ordered chicken tenders which were served with some fries. The crust was crunchy and well seasoned with a tasty and juicy interior. Fries were my favorite. They are thinly sliced and spice rub was on spot.   Overall, I recommend this place if you are a sports person and are looking for a place to watch some sports while you drink and dine!",

We just wanted two cocktails with water. We had just walked several blocks to get there and were thirsty.The cocktails were dropped off in a rush, but the water never came. The server never came back to our table on her own. We had to flag her down which was really challenging because she was ignoring us at level expert. We flagged down a man who seemed to be helping run food and asked for the waters. He confirmed they were short handed, and said he would get the water \"Yeah, yeah, I got you\", but he wasn't able to produce them either. We attempted to get the water from a bartender, but somehow could get their attention either. My daughter finally called to the man again and let him know we were still waiting on the water, and he seemed surprised. He had the server bring us the two waters finally.  We had finished the cocktails by then and she asked if we wanted another. We said no, just the check. Paid and left.  The server did apologize, but it was more of a last attempt at a tip sort of thing.",

First off, called to inquire about a happy hour, asked what the times were for Friday, and then made a reservation for Friday.  Arrived, expecting happy hour, then was told that there's no happy hour when there's a basketball game (this makes sense) but the part that was my issue is the employee who told me about the happy hour should've taken it upon themselves to say \"there's no happy hour this Friday because of the game\". This is a fault in customer service from my POV, withholding valuable information.  I literally came here with my coworkers FOR the happy hour, that's frustrating. The hostesses were very nice & smiley. Our server was sweet and pleasant, no doubt about that.  But wow, was she slow. Maybe she was overwhelmed? Maybe we were placed in an inconvenient location away from her section? Not sure. The kitchen was slow too. So was the bartender. Ordered drinks that took 15 minutes (they weren't even on a wait, definitely not as busy as I thought they would be). Appetizers took 30 minutes. And did not see our server AT ALL in between those times.  She had forgotten a water for one of us (okay, no big deal) but took over 8 minutes to bring it. Ended up asking someone else because one person is eating without a drink. Asked for ketchup (couldn't eat without it) waiting over 5 minutes for that as our food sat in front of us getting cold, ended up getting  OUT OF OUR SEATS and getting it ourselves. It was overall a really slow and irritating meal.",

They were huge and she said they were delish (her empty plate agreed).    The waitress said they prepared a crispy, lightly battered butterflied shrimp the same way as the wings... yes please! And, yes it was great! I'm going back tomorrow for two servings and a cold beer.. cant wait!   A neighboring table ordered the rueben and it was huge! He said it was good. Another ordered the cuban and it was pretty enormous and the patron said it was \"awesome\". My friend and I ordered the mediterranean salad with steak. Not a good choice. There were overly-cooked diced bits of steak on a bed of 'meh' lettuce. Something you'd get from an airport. It was drenched in some version of greek dressing that overpowered the salad.   Four stars because the food was ok, so a 3.5(?), but the menu options and waitstaff earned them a solid four.",

Here was an opportunity to finally eat at the downtown location near the Hyatt regency. We came around 8 pm and then service was slow  I had to ask twice for drinks and appetizers by going outside and chasing down a staff member. The food was average at best, French dip, pulled pork sandwich, and shrimp tacos were ordered. The only highlight of the evening was heading out the door and being stopped by a homeless war vet who asked me to purchase a framed pic of his poem for fifteen dollars. He impressed me with his intellect and demeanor that I gave him a twenty and my leftovers. I did thank him for his service before leaving. I would go back if needed but it would not be my first choice on 2nd avenue in Phoenix.",

The restaurant is big and there are huge screens to watch different sports events. The vibe is nice and the atmosphere similar to places like TG Fridays or BJs. I think Majerle's Sports Grill is a good place to go with a group of friends but always keeping in mind that is a casual, very casual restaurant. Both my drinks and food were a little disappointing; the cocktails were served with little pour, they were so weak that I felt I was drinking lemonade. Then I ordered the Majerle's wings which were cold so I had to ask the waited to place them in a box to take home. I left a little disappointed and that's a bummer because Majerle was one of my childhood idols due to his golden years in Phoenix. Unluckily, the restaurant did not remind me of Majerle's great years in Phoenix, it reminded me of Majerle's performance in 2001 when he was about to retire.",

I think it was the cheese they used (a kind of cheddar) but I wished I had just got regular fries after they came, the cheese crisp was over cooked and cold, my mom did not like the sandwich part of her french dip (just too boring and she even added mushrooms and onions), and the prices were well kind of over priced (I didn't think my burger was worth 9 bucks)   It was good, but I think I would only go back to drink alcohol.",

We ended up sharing a few things for our meal. 1) Pretzel Bites w/cheese  This wasn't to bad, we've had better. Pretzel was very soft, and the cheese sauce was excellent. And they give you a large portion.  2) Southwest Egg rolls Very good, sauce is on the spicy side but that's how I like it. Egg rolls was dead on.   3) Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl Again, an excellent dish! Big portion, enough for three people. Chicken and vegi's were great.

As we looked for spot to eat, we stumbled upon the Majerle's Sports Grill. It was Saturday night; the Diamondbacks had a home game nearby and the place was packed.  Luckily, we were seated relatively quickly, and the waiter soon took our drink order. As I mention, this restaurant at the time was full, very load and generally \"rocking\". After we got over the noise issue (to us), we enjoyed ourselves.  The food was pretty good and the wine selection was certainly adequate (for a sports bar). We order salads - mine was the Big Wills House (mix greens, onion, cucumber, tomato, cheddar cheese and croutons .... ranch), my lady had a straight czar. We shared the Fingers Frank Chicken Strips and French Fries.  All in all, this was a positive experience, including the food and service. Certainly convenient to the theater.",

The menu items are all names of former Suns players, but I am not sure there is really any personal connection to the dish.  I had Southwest Eggrolls and a Cajun Chicken Sandwich.  Both were really good and had excellent flavor.  The service was very good and there was plenty of seating.  It was also easy to watch the games because there were tv's literally everywhere.  The menu is a traditional sports bar type variety and I can't say I have ever had a bad meal here after several trips!",

The downtown Phoenix location is so inconsistent with their food and service.  My co-workers and I stopped in last week for lunch and unfortunately there was a convention taken place directly across the street from Majerle's.  That means Majerle's was operating on a very limited menu. 3 out of the 4 of us opted for Chicken Caesar salads.  The one co-worker that suggested Majerle's and suggested it ordered the Chef's salad.  This wasn't on the limited menu but it's on the regular menu.  It's huge, super big!  I want to say the wait for just 4 salads during lunch wasn't bad but it was.  I want to say the service isn't THAT bad but ... it's slow and neglectful ... always ... convention or not!",

Our waitress was fun and energetic and joked around with us a bit, wish I could remember her name so she could get a pat on the back or something.  The location is walking distance from the Phoenix Symphony Hall so we took advantage of that while our cars were conveniently parked in the garage nearby.  The prices are competitive for downtown, the portions are large and have great taste.   The atmosphere outside was quiet enough to converse. There were TV's I believe the sound was down, but we could keep up on some sports while hanging out with friends.  I recommend Majerle's if you're downtown, hungry and enjoy someone's company.",

Having to serve that many people (especially a bunch of sports guys!) could not have been easy, but they were pros, and certainly made it look easy.  The food was good, space was perfect, and service very accommodating.  Anything that wasn't to my liking was handled immediately. Our party was the talk of the convention the next day--for good reasons!  We'd definitely choose Majerle's again.  Thanks Dan! :)",

After all the bad stuff, I will say that I haven't had bad food there yet. Everything I've ordered has always been tasty and very fair priced which is pretty rare for downtown Phoenix. The drinks prices  are fair with plenty of options.   I did speak with a manager recently and he listened to my complaints and assured me to give this place another shot.

I feel like this is one of the few things you really cannot mess up when dining out anywhere, but the plate I had at Majerles was supremely subpar - there weren't many pieces of shrimp on the salad.  It was mostly a big plate of green with a few shrimps and they weren't well-seasoned either.  A few pieces of shrimp were really bland and then some were over-seasoned with whatever spice they threw on there.  The side of avocados was not a pleasant sight, they actually gave it to me on a small plate and the slices were half-browned by the time the plate arrived on the table.  Sure, I occasionally eat partially-browned avocados at home in my own kitchen, but I wouldn't serve it up to someone if I owned my own restaurant!    The service was attentive, but not overbearing.  Our server was really nice.  I'd be much more interested exploring the other dining options that are available in the area instead of returning to Majerles next time I'm in Phoenix.",

I mean \"GREAT\". I have enjoyed everything on the menu I have tasted so far. There is something on the menu for everyone and any type of dietary need. My favorites are the Boneless Wings, Chicken Strips (real white meat), and the Taco Salad. I am surprised the French Fries have not put McDonalds out of business. They are addicting. To top it off the they have top notch service. I have never had a problem, compliant or been disappointed. You can tell the employees love the place that they work out and enjoy to serve the patrons.  My office has had several private parties at this location. They have two areas where you can throw parties. My favorite is the Cotton Room. It is a private room that is very hip, urban, all white with glass mirrors surrounding the room. Kinda like a mini retro dance space. It has plush leather white seating, big screen tv's and a private bar. The resturant does catering and take-out.",

Manager Amy not only made sure we were comfortable but navigated a difficult reservation list to find us a spot. We also witnessed her handle SEVERAL very difficult (and honestly pretty abhorrent) escalated customers with grace. Food was excellent, daliahs Bloody Mary is out of this world, and the menu is versatile enough for even the pickiest 12th man. Thanks for making our SB49 experience that much better, y'all.",

    "text": "Hello Yelp Family,  I would like to share the experience I had at Majerle's Downtown Phoenix. My girlfriend and I attended their MLK event held on Saturday, January 14, 2012. My first issue with this establishment was the parking or lack thereof. Now I am new here to Phoenix from California and I am familiar with dining downtown. However, most establishments will validate your parking if they do not provide parking and your only option is to use the parking garage. I paid $12 to park in the parking garbage situated adjacent to Merle's and was advised upon arrival that they do not validate parking. I was also advised that the entrance for the MLK celebration was a block down on Washington??? That was a little weird for me especially during a MLK celebration....what are we in the 50's where blacks enter from the back???? That did not sit well with me. Another  issues I had with this place was the DJ. He came over and introduced himself as the DJ from Chicago. He was by far the worst DJ I have ever heard. The music was from one extreme to the other. There was skipping and long pauses between songs. I think Connor Cruise (Tom Cruise's son) would have done a better job. Lastly, the drinks were watered down. It was the first time I had a long island ice tea, that actually taste like ice tea with no alcohol. I will give Majerle's 2 stars. One because the food looked appetizing, although I didn't eat anything and one star because it was the first time since I've lived in Phoenix, that I encounter other black professionals over 30. I am still looking for a place where upscale professional black people over 30 mingle.",

Now what place on earth serves up cookie-encrusted grease-soaked cod with sugar-laced french fries???  Yuck. - The tartar sauce to go with that?  Nope.  Just all mayo. - Hot wings, surprisingly, we're okay. - Philly cheesesteak sandwich - ick. - Cole slaw, more like sugar slaw.  Place blows.

The (assumed) manager tonight was looking for any reason not to honour the program, even after being advised what the program is and how it is redeemed.

I swear there's nothing like their fries! I'd also recommend the taco salad, which is not as good as when they had the taco shells but is still pretty bomb.  Its prime location serves as a great place for a pregame drink or dinner, or same afterward. The bar is also pretty legit and is nice for watching an away game or home game you don't have tix to.   If you are coming with a large group, reserve the Cotton Club in advance for a more private experience.   When there's not a major event/game in downtown, you can often find parking at the meters right around the viscinity. Otherwise, park in one of the garages nearby.",

Lots of nostalgia on the walls and Suns regalia. As far as the food: it's pretty damn good. They have all the usual selections for beer, they may be able to improve in that category. But if you have Kiltlifter, you're doing pretty well in my book.   If you are debating about going here or TK I would absolutely positively go to this joint! Go Suns!",

Booths are big and comfortable for group seating.  The staff is always pleasant and helpful with whatever you need.",

    "text": "Great sports bar!  Beer on tap selection is meh.. but I've learned to not expect much from sports bars.  The wing secret sauce is a MUST-HAVE. It's the perfect amount of spicy and sweet.  Here's what we ordered and how it was:  Rojo Diablo - it's fried chicken breast dipped in the special wing sauce and mozzarella is added. The flavors were all there! The bread is mildly sweet which was a nice touch. The chicken was a bit a dry but I ordered wing sauce on the side which helped.  Sweet potato fries - If you like sweet potato fries, these will do the job. Nothing to crazy, just your average sweet potato fries.  Gorilla Wings in Mild - think Native Newyorker Wings. This is the quality. It does the job and is much better than the Hooters down the street  Gorilla Wings in Secret Sauce - DO IT.  Fries - If you're not a shoestring fries fan, then don't get them! They are just your basic shoestring fries.  Fish Tacos - I didn't try them but was told they did a great job.  Potato Skins - Good!  Cheese Fries - They're basically fries with cheese melted on top.  Sooo yeah. They're good though! At least it's not processed cheese.   It's bar food. So expect bar food quality. It's a great place to watch the game. Some of the loudest most active fans come to this location so be forewarned.  The customer service was great! They messed up our order twice but we got a free beer and free order of fries so, no complaints here. Plus they were super busy so no hard feelings.",

Our drinks were great and our server was busy but kept  everyone happy.

We were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant, it lengthened our service time considerably.  Our daughter ordered the salad special. It had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing. Her husband got the Rojo Diablo sandwich. He said it was 'stringy' and didn't finish it. My wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a 'lettuce bun'. She got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce. I got the All-Star burger. It was good but overcooked by two levels.   The fries and sweet potato fries were good, as was the selection of drinks. All told, for three sandwiches, a salad and six beers it totaled $85. Too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location.   Thunder Dan better get back to his restaurant and read the reviews. I may not be back.",

I grew up watching \"Thunder Dan\" play, and I think this is a really good place to watch a game. Naturally, the staff are young women with fast drink-mixing skills and exposed midriffs.  Food? Meh. There's nothing wrong with it, but there's nothing out of the ordinary, and nothing executed particularly well. My burger was an average burger. My chicken sandwich was an average chicken sandwich. If you HAVE to eat like right now, it will do. But considering where you are, you've got soooo many cooler options to dine.  When you're done, the light rail is a stone's throw away. Sometimes I need a solid sports bar to drink a domestic and yell at a screen with the guys. Downtown doesn't offer too many options for that, so Majerle's will continue to get my business.",

Ordered a strawberry lemonade, which was splendid and refreshing. I also got the Gorilla Wings (bone-in wings), I'd been having a hankering for wings. Being gluten free, you can imagine my surprise when they brought them out, in all their breaded glory. OY! Nary a mention of the breading on the menu, who breads their chicken wings?! [The boneless wings specifically state they are breaded] The server politely asked me what else I'd like, while everyone around me was enjoying their food, and not wanting to make us late for the concert, I ordered some french fries. They brought them to me very quickly. They did not charge me for the wings and the manager did apologize to me.  Having said that, the other people I was with all ordered something that came with french fries, including one friend who ordered a burger. The server that brought the food (not our regular server) did not bring mustard or ketchup so we had to ask. A few minutes later, still no condiments but our regular server did stop by and we had to again ask for the condiments. What server doesn't automatically bring those condiments to a table full of people who will no doubt need them?! Seriously it's just common sense. I was not particularly enthused about my visit and, although a huge fan of Thunder Dan's, I will likely not stop in again anytime soon.",

Thank goodness there was an enormous TV hanging over my head so I could hold the menu up to its flickering blue light.  And don't go if you want to actually hear what your meal-mates are saying.  We were in an out of the way spot, and still had trouble hearing what was being said at the other end of the table.  At some point I think we just stopped trying to converse and started shouting and making hand gestures at each other.  A knowledge of sign language would have come in handy here.  I love Ruben sandwiches.  I try them almost every place I go to that serves them.  The one I got at Majerle's was not good.  Not good at all.  I've had hundreds of Rubens, and this one had some very weird, off-tasting spice in it that should not EVER be in a Ruben.  I still can't put my finger on what it was, but I've never tasted it in a Ruben sandwich before and hope I never do again.  The soda I ordered tasted like all carbonation and not much syrup.  Reminded me of Alka-Seltzer.  I would have given it one star, but the sweet potato fries were pretty good.",

The bar service is slow as molasses, and they have the audacity to take a $60 hold on your credit card every time you sit anywhere near the door, even when I go in dressed in a nice suit and tie. The wings are my favorite in Phoenix, and are delicious, but everything else on the menu seems to be just adequete. One thing I can count on is them always being open until at least midnight and having decent food. You can also count on being harassed by bike taxi guys and hobos out front, and getting crappy bar service. Just walk in, order the wings to go, and have a nice meal in the park or at your home.",

    "text": "I took my two children here after going to the museum on a Saturday afternoon.  I ordered a fruit plate to start with and then we were going to share a hamburger.  She asked how I'd like it cooked and I said \"medium\".    When my fruit plate was dropped off by another person, no silverware or napkins were left.  We started eating the fruit with our fingers.  The waitress walked by and saw us.  I assumed she was going to get silverware.  But then I didn't see her again until she brought the hamburger.  There were so many things wrong at this time.  First, the fact that I had to ask for silverware and napkins in a restaurant is absurd.  Especially seeing that I have 2 children under the age of 4.  I obviuosly need napkins!  But the hamburger was WELL done and absolutely tasteless.  There was nothing on it.  I had to ask for mustard.  When I ordered the hamburger I told her it was for us 3 to split.  She just brought over the hamburger on one plate with no extras.  I had to cut the hamburger into pieces and tear one of our drink napkins to put the burgers on for my kids. At this point I was so annoyed and tired and wanted to leave.  I asked for the check when she finally walked by a few minutes later (she never came by to ask how anything was).  I didn't even want to bother complaining and waiting to get more food.  After a long day, I just wanted to leave.  But I would never come back again.",

    "text": "I'm not really fond of writing sub par reviews. I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my \"I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends\" template.    Majerle's is one of those experiences.  I know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.  When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.      If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check.    Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine.  Not so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests. Downright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.  If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again. Probably Not.",
