    "text": "I've be hearing about this place for a while now, from who else.. my mother. She eats hear every once in awhile with her friends and raves about. Today was my turn. I was her guest and it was great.   A very unassuming, cozy place. To start with, we entered from the back which was kind of the kitchen. I mean, there were people preparing food and making pies, so.. I guess that's ok because I liked seeing where my food was going to be made. It was immaculate, by the way.  The service was excellent. The Hostess and servers were nice and polite, and anywhere that has it's first dollar taped to the wall along side softball team pictures and giant trophies gets big points with me.  My mom had the meatloaf, which she always has, and I had the same. It came with choice of sides. I had irish potatoes,steamed veggies and a salad for starters. Meatloaf was awesome, but go ahead and ask for a to-go container right off the bat.. you won't finish it.  I must say, I was quite satisfied with the meal. To top it off, they played \"happy birthday\" over the PA and brought out a huge wedge of cheese cake, which I haven't eaten yet. They also took my picture and printed it out on photo paper before we left.  All and all, a good birthday meal at a friendly place.  Thanks.",

    "text": "Vaguely remembered this place from Yelp when we were looking for a lunch spot after a visit to the Acxupuncturist up the street. We pulled into the lot and by the looks of the outside, there was a bit hesitancy to go in. So, thank you to my friend's smartphone for allowing us to read the yelp reviews and allow us to take a chance on this place. I am happy to say our first visit was a good one.   Everyone has said already, it is homey and maybe a bit dated in its decor. However, I don't care for ambiance and classy settings, I care about decent food and friendly service.  MMR has both. I had the Hot Turkey lunch special for Thursdays and I have to say  it was huge for a lunch plate and the price was so reasonable. Maybe I am old school, but when you bring me hot bread and butter right after I order, you have already won me over. Then the Turkey Plate came and it was really good, moist and flavorful. The potatoes are not mashed, they are smashed-there are actually potato chunks in there. I was not thrilled with the stuffing because IMO it had too much sage (to the point of overpowering) in it and that was distracting me from what otherwise would have been a very good stuffing. There was also  MORE  BREAD given to me with my meal in the form of a roll. That was good because I needed it to dip in the copious amounts of gravy on the plate.   Mia was our server and she was really great. Very attentive, helpful and actually seemed to enjoy serving us. Rare these days. This staff has it together.    We were stuffed and decided to opt-out on dessert and take an APPLE  pie to-go. The pie was still warm when she brought us the box and it traveled well for 3 hours all the way to Marana. My friends boyfriend is  the pie lover and he had two slices after dinner that night and I can say we all loved it. I ate a slice for breakfast the next day. Excellent, excellent  pie.   Our two lunches, two beverages and a pie to go was $35, considering the pie was about 1/3 of that, not bad at all.   We go to the acupuncturist this Tuesday and I plan on getting more yumminess from MMR.",

    "text": "$20 FOR A LOAF OF BREAD!!! I was a regular customer for 15 years, mostly for bread and their pies, especially at Thanksgiving. But after a horrible experience there this past week, I will never go back. On Wednesday, I went to My Mother's to buy a loaf of whole wheat bread. The loaf costs $2.16 with tax. I gave the server a $20 bill (I had just come from the ATM) and 26 cents. We got to chatting about the bread, recipes, pie, etc., and I was not really paying attention when she gave me change--one dime, 10 cents, instead of the $18.10 I should have received. I did not notice this until the next morning when I was paying bills and only had 20s in my wallet. I dumped out my purse, searched the car and the plastic bag that my bread had come in. Nothing. I called the restaurant and talked to the person who had helped me the previous day. She told me I could come in and she would give me the money, later adding it would come out of her own wallet. I asked to speak to the manager to find out if the receipts for the previous day showed an overage. He said they did not and that I must have misplaced the change and that the server told him that she handed me three 5s and three 1s. Uh, NEVER happened. She had told me when I first talked to her that she had thought as I left that she should have counted out the money for me as they are required, but she did not, because there had been another incident where a customer said he or she did not get back the correct change. Again, she never counted out the money because she NEVER gave it to me. I festered overnight and called backed the next day, again asking for the manager. The person who answered asked what the problem was and I explained, again, plus I told her that I had not told the manager that the server had offered me the money virtually from the get-go when I first called the previous day. I told her I was very upset and could ill afford to be out $18. The person I was speaking with said the manager was not in, but took my number and said he would get back to me. I never heard from him. They won't hear from me again, either. But they also have lost my business for good and that of everyone I know. And, I am sure this is not the last time that change will mysteriously disappear. I am scrupulously honest, even to the point of telling checkers at the grocery store if they undercharge me for an item, even if it is off by a few cents. I have no motive to make this up. Crappy customer service, to say the least.",

    "text": "If you are someone that cooks at home, you might be less impressed with MMR, but even so, there are a few things on their menu that are standouts.  The turkey meal is really quite good and I like that you can choose the sides that are to your liking.  The chicken and dumpling soup is thick and creamy (and even a little addictive).  The first time that I saw it as one of the daily offerings, I asked what the server thought it was sort of funny when she told me that people will call about the daily selections and come in when this one is offered... now I am one of those people. During strawberry season, you cannot leave without having a slice of the strawberry pie. It is piled with fresh berries and covered in a mountain of freshly whipped cream.  Portions are large, so if you want pie consider taking a slice (1/4 of a pie) home with you.  The crust isn't the most tender, but the flavor is good and they generally have at least six flavors to choose from. Fruit fillings are made from scratch, so you are best off choosing something that is in season.  Hint: if you are going to buy two slices, it is actually just as cheap to get a whole pie.  I really do like this place for some of the more exceptional choices, the fact that they have a relatively extensive menu, and that they deliver.  Upping their rating to 4 stars.  :)",

    "text": "A nice homestyle cooking restaurant tucked away in a strip mall.  Step in and step back to 1960's/1970's with great food and great service the way it used to be.  My husband found it on Yelp, trying to find a place for prime rib.  Little did he know we would find so much more.  After reading about the raves of their turkey, apparently everyone else had discovered it, too, and they had run out.  I got the meatloaf instead and was impressed.  (And so was the prime rib hubby had been jonesing for. ) You can tell a good cook by their meatloaf.  The salad bar had fresh veggies and something I hadn't seen for awhile, green olives!  The bread was delicious, but I was saving room for the pie.  PIES!  It is not just a slice of pie, but 1/4 of the pie.  Our table tried the blueberry, apple and chocolate peanut butter.  I wish we had more people so I could sample more!  Not only do they have good cooks at this place, but bakers, too!   My sister who lives in Phoenix and had never heard or been to this place, went back two days later - and got the apple pie again.  Funny, she didn't share any of her apple pie the first time, so you know this has to be probably the best apple pie she's had.  Proof that you should check Yelp when visiting new cities and even where you live.  You'll discover good eating, good service and a good time.",

    "text": "Chicken Fried Steak.  With brown gravy.  :drools:  I don't think there's ever a bad time to eat chicken fried steak. Or chicken fried chicken (redundant much?), for that matter.  While I normally steer clear of salad bars (an odd combination of resisting my rabbit tendencies and a major phobia of how ineffectively people bathe themselves before going into public eateries) , the salad bar at My Mother's has always been clean ad well stocked. And maybe because I feel like I'm back in the Midwest that I let go of those things that hold be back from splurging at salad bars? Perhaps. I don't eat sweets so I won't comment on the pies.  But let's move on to what's really important--the chicken fried steak.  I don't know how they make it so good, but I could eat this meal on a regular basis and never get tired of it. Crispy on the outside; moist on the inside. Just how mama used to make it...if she ever did make it. I love love love the new potatoes. The service has always been good-to-great (trying hard to remember the server's name who does it so good, and pulling blanks). And the ambiance is, well, I guess other-worldly might fit. It's not the location you'd go to and think, \"I'd love to have my commitment ceremony here. Honey, don't you think this motif would come across *darling* on film?\" But, that's not always a bad thing.  Perhaps what really draws me to this place is, as much as I hate to admit it, some times I miss home. Coming here is like being back in Fulton County and being with my family or friends at one of the local restaurants [not that we had a surplus of such]. It's everything that My Mother's is that takes me back to Ohio and reminds me of all the good things that I left.  Oh, great. I just turned a review into a pilot for Lifetime.",

On Thursday it's chicken fried steak with choice of white or brown gravy.  I had the white and it came with the taste of bacon drippings in it....just like my mother used to make!  It was excellent..simply excellent.  Am planning on going back today (Thurs) to see if it's excellent twice.  I don't like Turkey which seems to be Mother's claim to fame.  Wife liked it so much that the second time she had the turkey again.  I've also tried the roast beef which I don't normally care for but this was excellent.  It came on a open  bread bun.  The beef was excellent.  A couple of men in a neighboring table were raving about the pot pie.  Will try that next time. I gave it four stars but considering that it's American down home cuisine, and that that kind of restaurant is very hard to find it probably deserves five stars. If you try it, you'll like it.

This will definitely become our \"go to\" restaurant when we are looking for comfort food and amazing pie.",

Something that whole family can just chill and relax.  Okay but theres more!! Not only the food are tasty, they are also HUGE! Their sandwich can feed 2 persom their pies (ONE slice) can feed 3 person, no joke.

Turkey was good, nice that it was actual turkey breast, not sliced cold cut turkey. But the \"roasted vegetables\", sorry, those were stewed vegetables taken out of a pot roast & put into the delivery container with the oil from the stew. Very unsavory. On the whole, paying nearly $40 for this meal was a gross injustice. I saw many glowing reviews on Yelp & was looking forward to this meal. I wish I just had cereal.",

I had the cod fish but I learned I could switch out the fries for a veggie, I had the greens which were the highlight of my meal. Those green beans were so good I could actually see myself getting two sides  of green beans to go often. I hope they'll sell them to me.

    "text": "Can't believe I haven't reviewed them yet. I've been going here off and on since childhood. My Mother's tastes like homecooking.   I highly recommend the chicken fried steak and chicken fried chicken. They are my favorites. The prime rib is decent for the price. The mashed potatoes with bacon flavored gravy is always tasty. They have a small but enjoyable salad bar. And the last time I dined here, I noticed a trip to the salad bar is included with the entree. Before, I think there was a nominal fee.   The worst thing I can say about the food is the hot vegetables taste like they're prepared from a frozen bag. I usually always go with corn on the cob. And it's good but you can tell it's not fresh. I ordered a delivery pizza once. It has a home cook taste to it. Specifically the crust tastes like it was made from a bisquick mix or something. It's not bad, but I like the blue plate special type food better than their pizza. They also have a good selection of pies. The menu prices are pretty cheap too. Don't expect anything fancy, but overall it's a good family type restaurant.",

    "text": "Any time of year, if I'm craving a home cooked turkey dinner with mashed potatoes and stuffing and cranberry sauce, I know I need to look no further than My Mother's Restaurant. The turkey has always been tender and moist, the mashed potatoes real and the gravy tasty. A fresh whole wheat loaf of bread to mop up the gravy and I am done for. It's always filling and satisfying. Their prime rib and every other meal I've ever eaten there were just as good. Simple, tasty filling home style food is their niche! Their pies are very good and it's not some little 1/8th or 1/6th sliver, it's a quarter of a pie!. Either still be hungry, plan on sharing with a friend (or do what I do and get it to go, then you've got a late night snack. Fancy expensive decor and furnishings, nope. The food keeps me coming back!",

I'm recovering from the latest contagious disease circulating through my office and needed comfort food that could be delivered!  Of course I thought of My Mother's because they have always been there for me.  And they have pie, which is always yummy.  I ordered the TPP (turkey pot pie ) AND a piece of pumpkin pie \"for tomorrow's breakfast\".    The TPP was nothing short of transcendental---and I don't say that lightly.  The pastry topping was perfect, the turkey and veggies were perfectly cooked, and the gravy was perfectly spiced as well.  The side of mashed potatoes and gravy that accompanied the TPP were also perfect.  I have always loved this place but the TPP literally bumped it up to my very short list of 5-star favorites!!!  P.S.  The pie didn't last until the morning either.",

    "text": "I used to see this place all the time across the street from my bus stop when I would take the bus north to work.  When I switched jobs, a co-worker made mention of this place.  Years later, after finding myself in a \"What do I want for lunch, Yelp?\" moment, I decided now was the time to check this place out.  And it was totally worth the wait.  I got take-out at this place, since I was taking it to my boyfriend for his lunch break.  I ordered ahead, and was met with a super friendly staff once I got there.  The place looks a lot like Americana Grandma's kitchen--wooden walls, floral patters, silk flowers.  The place has no windows so it was kind of dim, and all of the reviews and awards in the front were circa 1990's.  The TV in the bar area was an old CRT set which, while I was there, was being replaced with a bigger CRT set.  \"Oh, is that the new TV?  ...Well, new to US, anyway,\" one of the girls said.  I laughed.  There also seemed to be nice, harmonic teamwork among the staff which made the wait feel a little more pleasant.  The portion sizes were amazing for the price.  I ordered a the freshly carved turkey and meatloaf lunches, and they're pretty much the dinner sizes just sans an extra side.  You will eat good and probably have left overs with just that alone.  I had ordered two slices of pie and drinks the (ounce) size of Polar Pops as well, and the cashier told me ordering a certain amount had earned one of the pies for free.  Now, I've had better in other places, but I have a feeling the food is purposely bland and not overwhelming for the customers that seem to go there (older population).  But if you want a good meal that has all the feeling of going to your mom's house, this is the place.  Much better than \"home-cooked styled\" places like Boston Market, and for a price that won't drive you into debt.",

The other good thing is the price. $8+ per sandwich with sides. The waitress couldn't have been more attentive. I asked for something special with my soup and it was delivered just right. Drinks were filled and she asked if everything was as ordered. What more could you ask for. Will be back with my wife for lunch in the future.",

Growing up with very little, My Mother's was a special treat for my dad and me. Back then, this was the fancy place to eat. Some of my fondest childhood memories were in this little hole-in-the-wall. We had a tradition of ordering the large prime rib - something I still do to this day.   I've been to just about every steakhouse in town, and My Mother's prime rib is still the best - hands down. Their complimentary bread rolls are practically addictive, and the salad bar is loaded with fresh veggies and homemade dressings. Everything on their menu is perfect and reminiscent of what \"Grandma's Cooking\" was like as a child. And... don't even get me started on their homemade pies that put Marie Calendar's to shame.  The atmosphere is very Country and comfortable. It's not modern and fancy, but that's part of what makes this place so special. If you haven't tried My Mothers, you don't know what you're missing.",

It was basically just a 3 inch thick crust topped with your run of the mill bought in canned sauce, cheese and somewhat decent pepperoni. Over all the pizza was not a big hit. We also got a coconut cream pie as well, i hoped it would redem the meal... no luck. Where to start, the crust was very salty, the dough had also been very overworked, making it hard as rock and very dry. The coconut filling was bland and almost doughy. I would have preferred a frozen pizza and pie from safeway, and i wouldnt have had to pay $33 for it. Not worth it at all. I hate criticizing restaurants, because i like to hope that someone is putting their heart and soul into their products, but sometimes you have to hear the bad to be aware of what you need to do to be better.",

Been around for year and is certainly a gem!",

They are super friendly and comes by frequently to keep your table clear.  The complimentary wheat bread comes in a little loaf.  It's simple but so good. Comes hot with butter.  Their menu looks confusing at first and even repetitive but it's mostly just split into lunch and dinner portions.    I like the ribs, bbq chicken, and lasagna here.  Their portions are generous and truly,  you are getting way more for your buck here than anywhere else similar (cough chains cough) Most things on the dinner menu are under $11.00.  The only thing is they really could fix up the inside a bit,  but I understand if they can't or won't.  The booths sag and some of the paintings are off putting. Also I wished the sides that come with the plates had more oomph. Most times they are pretty bland tasting.  Also,  they seem small, especially in contrast to the generous main course. Maybe that's just my selective experiences.  Come for a home style cooked meal.",

Could be consTrued as too much food, but I don't want to ruin that for everyone else. I like the old look and feel. My favorite kind of look. I've dined in and carried out. I've had pie, fabulous.  Here's the but. 1 particular delivery driver needs to leave his attitude problems at home. The drivers line up at the to go window waiting for their delivery food. Which is no big deal given there is not a lot of space in lobby to begin with. So I came in and stood behind what I thought was just a grumpy customer who couldn't handle waiting a few minutes. Turns out, he was a driver. Which means he is an employee, which means he represents the restuarant. Which means his even short time at the window can affect someone's viewpoint of the store. Please train or retrain this guy, that some customers notice behavior like that and remember it even if it's for less than a minute of exposure. He's a sour note on an otherwise wonderful place to eat.   I'm still going back, cause everyone else more than makes up for it.",

However, the pizza was good, not greasy, thin crust, and really delicious, And for the price, you really can't beat it.. $17 (w/o tip), so there really isnt a fast food pizza joint that could do this. But if you slightly feel hungry, order, it may take awhile. It is worth it! On a funny note, if you pay with card, they do a carbon copy of your card... so its old school, like your mama was running the joint. I'll give them a couple of more tries!

Nine times out of ten I'll get the open faced turkey sandwich, which is made with REAL home cooked turkey, not processed meat, with real mashed potato's and cranberry sauce. Excellent! Friends also recommend the steak sandwich, which you have to ask for. It's not on the menu, but they are more than happy to make it for you. If you want to impress your friends, park in back and take them in through the service entry doors, and on into the restaurant. It's kind of like Durant's, without the atmosphere.",

    "text": "Visited for the first time and saw half of Glendale's police force there.  Can't be a bad sign, right?  Got the Turkey pot pie with a trip to the salad bar, plus a serving of bread. Salad bar is small, but the details shine through in the homemade blue cheese dressing and marinated beets.  Nice. Bread was nice and hot. Pot pie was quite sizable and the filling was heavenly.  Everything was simplicity done well.  Very homey.  Took the banana cream pie home because I couldn't stuff it after everything.  This is where some disappointment set in. The \"slice\" of pie looked huge! Perhaps my expectations were built up by the reviews so when I dug in and found it somewhat lacking the \"cream\" custard filling I just could not get over my disappointment. My favorite part of the pie was barely there, because it was just piles of bananas with a light dressing of whipped cream on a nice crust.  Hmm, personal preference perhaps, but I want my cream filling!  All in all, not a date place but a decent stop for some solid home-eats.  Would I return?  Only if I were in the area and I was really craving some big portions of homeyness. Oh, the waitresses were so sweet.  They deliver service like how it's done since our grand-mamas :) Thank you ladies! Now the only thing you have to do is put the cream back in \"banana cream pie\" and desert would be heavenly!",

My son changes around, but usually ends up with the chicken fried steak which he loves.  So what if the decor isn't fancy? I'm going there to eat not pass some interior design test on the place.  They have made it homey and serve absolutely delicious food.  If some of you didn't like it because it wasn't fancy enough for you - don't let the door hit you on the way out and no one will miss you either!",

I had the meatloaf it tasted ok but honestly the texture was yuck. Roasted turkey was edible a big serving. Chocolate cream pie was pudding but not creamy kinda thick and sticky crust was not awesome. Too bad I wanted it to be so much.",

The banana was delicious and the apple was the best of the bunch! Their crust tasted so good and was perfectly browned. Also, the price is right here.... We got a whole (large) pie for less than 12$.

I get the mashed potatoes and green beans. Then, surprise, under the juicy tender fresh turkey lurks stuffing. Comes w a side of cranberry sauce. I always take half home (they are not stingy), and eat a great comfort lunch the next day. I love this place when I'm tired of all the trendy stuff. It's really comforting and yummy food, but you have to choose wisely because it's a huge menu. Mashed are better than baked potatoes, love the side salad bar...you choose. Buttery green beans just like mom's (canned...but who cares) are better than the corn on the cob, which can be over cooked...chicken fried steak better than spaghetti.....you get it. Really friendly service by normal relaxed people...no pretense. Odd strip mall, but who cares. Keep going My Mother's!",

Prices are not bad either.  Parking does suck but they have parking in the back.  I don't even try to park up front anymore.  They have a back door to the restaurant if you park out back as well.

I know for a fact they make everything from fresh ingredients and make their gravy like Mom or Grandma did. I'd like someone to bring me some canned gravy that has the flavor and consistency that it does here! Now that I'm done ranting, you  must try the turkey dinner! It is the bomb! Make sure you get the cranberry sauce with it. Meatloaf, prime rib, lasagne, are some of my families favs. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is the fact that they need to bring in a nicer table wine .

And I never had any of the alleged gastrointestinal repercussions that I anticipated.  The roast turkey is better than my mom ever made, not that it means much because my mom never cooked.  But it's still good.  The salad bar is pretty awesome too.  It's small, but they manage to fit almost every thing I could possibly want into a four foot long space.  And, they have real homeade bleu cheese dressing that tastes like bleu cheese throughout.  Not like the crappy version that tastes like ranch with bleu cheese lumps in it.  I had the pizza once and was incredibly underwhelmed.  Maybe it's better when you get it at the restaurant and not as take-out, but I'll never try it again.  It reminded me of a frozen pizza.  Today, because we're on a mission to find awesome wings, ordered some wings as our appetizer.  Our entrees came out before our appetizer.  But when we told the waiter they immediately put them in to cook to our specifications.  Then they didn't charge us for it.  Nice!  Bad service?  No, just an honest mistake that they immediately corrected.  The wings however were not that good.  They were cooked crispy like we like it and the sauce had the right ingredients, but the ratio of butter:vinegar:heat was off.  Too much butter!  I felt like I was eating wings in cream sauce it was so buttery.  It coated my mouth with an oily gunk for far too long.  Maybe I wouldn't have noticed if it actually came as an appetizer.  I still love My Mother's, particularly for the stuff that my mother should have made: turkey, chicken, meat loaf, turkey pot pie, etc.  But I would stay away from the wings and pizza.",

    "text": "#4 in an on-going series of restaurants I've never set foot in.  Sporting one of the most conversation-muddling names in recent history, My Mother's Restaurant serves up home cookin' just like your mom hypothetically used to make. No matter how you look at it, My Mother's is \"A Good Place To Be\"  Their specialty is homemade meals. All dinners come with mashed potatoes and gravy, corn and a dinner roll. Your choice of entrees includes meat loaf, prime rib, roast beef, spare ribs and many more. My Mother's also offers pastas, sandwiches (the open-faced turkey sandwich is quite tasty), roasted chicken, salads and pizza.   My Mother's has some of the best homemade pie I've yet to encounter in Phoenix. The Coconut Cream and Chocolate Cream pies are outstanding with a melt in your mouth crust. Slices of pie run around $4, but when you can get an entire pie for just over double the price of a single slice, you'll be face-deep in an entire pie in no time.   My Mother's, of course, delivers and also offers catering services. They don't deliver between the hours of 2pm and 5pm, however, so bear that in mind the next time you crave a slice of sin.",

I really like how the restaurant is glowing with a home made feel with great food.  My mothers food is the best and 2nd best is My mother's in Phoenix.  This location is not so easy to find but once you visit it you will always know how to get back to mothers house.    The Bread offered before your meal is a nice touch and it is delicious.  Aside from the mind blowing Lasagna the turkey pot pie is great as well.  You are sure not to leave from the restaurant hungry.    Happy eating! I'll see you at My Mother's",

Between my girlfriend and I we ordered the pot roast and father's cut prime rib. The pot roast had a flavor that was unusual, and not in a good way. The prime rib was a nice cut but dry and flavorless. The salad bar is mediocre with basic items that were at least fresh. The steak and vegetable soup also had a strange not good taste I was thoroughly disappointed. The only reason I give this place 2 stars rather than 1 is for the complimentary fresh baked wheat bread. It was pretty good with butter. They also sell the bread by the loaf.",

    "text": "I went to My Mother's for dinner with a large group of family members (16), including 6 kids ranging in age from newborn to 8 years old. While the decor was generically bad \"down-home\" from the 80's, the staff was very nice and seated us in a side room with plenty of space for all of us.  The meal started with homemade bread which was warm and soft. This gave me hope that the meal wouldn't be in keeping with the general feel of the place. Alas, my hope was not long lived and I soon felt like an Obama supporter watching McCain win the election.  After ordering, I made my way to the salad bar. This seemed quaint, considering that salad bars aren't really popular anymore, unless you're at Souper Salad or Sweet Tomatoes. The salad bar was not entirely scary, but wasn't anything worth going back to. I'm fairly certain everything came out of a can, bag, bottle or box. The freshest thing may have been the red onion, which obviously had been poorly sliced by hand.  Moving on to the main course, I had Mother's Meat Loaf dinner. My meat loaf came with rice pilaf and green beans. Once again, food from cans and boxes made an appearance, as my beans were canned and my rice must have come from a box mix. The meatloaf was actually made from non-canned meat, but wasn't all that exciting. It had been cooked with ketchup slathered on top, yet was served with gravy on the side (probably originally made from a powder mix). I ate most of my dinner because I was hungry, not because of the quality.  Hoping for a come-from-behind win in a big electoral state, I ordered pie for dessert. They tout their homemade pies, but seem to think that \"homemade\" means making pie from canned ingredients. My cherry pie was not spectacular, as the preprocessed cherry filling was encased in crust which attempted to be light, flaky and buttery, but only managed to be dry and chewy.  My Mother's was saved from a one-star rating by two things...the graciousness and patience of the staff, and the low prices. For two dinners and a huge slice of pie split between my wife and I, our total bill including tax and tip was $35.  My advice is to keep your hope in homestyle cooking and stay out of My Mother's Restaurant.",

Since I won't be headed to Saugatuck, MI this summer, I won't be able to get my annual open faced roast beef at the Kalico Kitchen. So I decided to give Mother's version a try. Not too shabby. Dinners come with a lot of bread and butter, and some come with a trip to the salad bar. Hubby really liked their cole slaw.  Then, we fought over pie. I wanted coconut cream, but Hubby sat there dejectedly until I relented on the chocolate peanut butter. Damn manipulator. The filling was mighty tasty, but  I did not care for the stabilized whipped cream on top. It didn't taste as fresh as it should have. The pie slices are massive, so our sweet gamer-boy waiter brought it to us already cut in half.   We might be back, maybe some night when neither of us wants to cook and we're tired of the usual suspects.",

    "text": "If I were rating just the pie, they would get five stars and then some.  The facility is in a not-so-spectacular part of town, and it shows both inside the restaurant and out.  The staff is friendly, although I noticed a couple of them are short a few teeth...  I have a thing with teeth.  I don't suppose it really affects most peoples' dining experience.  However, if you, like I, have a thing about teeth, be prepared.  Of the food I have eaten there, thus far, it's been of good quality.  They have a modest salad bar, complete with all kinds of tasty goodies, packed into an even more modest space; it takes up both sides of a passage to get to half the south seating area, so if you linger you might get a chance to get up close and personal with some of your fellow diners.  I haven't actually set foot in the kitchen, but I get the distinct impression that they make their own bread.  They serve small loaves of it as an appetizer with your meal.  The dough is also used to make their pizza, which my son orders every time we go there.  Oh, and the pies.  If everything that is good and right could be made into a pie, it would be these pies.  We actually started going there because My Mother's was kind enough to donate some pies to a breast cancer event my wife was taking part in, and she enjoyed the pies so much we had to eat at the restaurant to thank them and to get more pie.  That's when I got my first taste of the pie.  I can not recommend the banana cream pie highly enough.  To summarize, the place is a bit run down, nice people, decent food (although, don't go if you're watching what you eat), good bread and pies that are almost as good as sex was, back when I was younger and could do it right...",

Get the turkey dinner: thick slices of turkey, with mashed potatoes, delicious green beans, and cornbread stuffing.

So off to \"Mother's\" I went. I already knew I wanted it to go, so I did not stay for the full service or the ambiance of the place. My friend that came with me ordered the Apple Pie, and I wanted the Pumpkin pie but I'm a self proclaimed pumpkin pie snob,so I was leery of ordering it. After all,I was there ordering pie to go, I didn't want to get home and be disappointed so I ordered the coconut cream pie. Then I said to hell with it and also ordered the pumpkin pie...I figured my coconut pie will be my fall back when I throw the pumpkin pie in the trash and yell at myself for ever ordering two slices of pies. I asked \"Trudy\" the young lady helping us to put whip cream all over the pumpkin pie... For me, that's the only way to eat it, and man she didn't hold back, it was the perfect amount. As I got home I could wait for my taste test,even though I already had made my mind up it tasted horrible before I even tried it. So the moment of truth was in front of me as I'm starring at this slice of pie, which by the way is a quarter of the pie. The slices are huge!! I grabbed my fork and dug in. I first looked at the consistency of the filling, it looked really good, not over cooked and was actually made with real ingredients. The crust was thick,buttery and flaky completely home made. As I opened my mouth and placed this bite of pie onto my pallet I knew this was not the ordinary restaurant type of pie.. this was actually a homemade pie that someones mom,dad,aunt,grandma,sister etc actually made. The spices were just perfect for me, and it actually reminded me of my mom's pumpkin pie. I ate the entire slice, then yelled at myself when I realized I have a huge slice of coconut pie starring at me!! This is the only place I have ever found that has legit pumpkin pie...Costco's pumpkin pie is crap,Village Inn pie is crap, Coco's pies are crap compared to this. Now it could be a fluke and I might have gotten the head chefs pie I don't know, but I will be back to see trudy again and have her slop on a huge heaping of whipped cream on my pumpkin pie. And a side note, my friend like her apple pie a lot. I did have a taste and it was very flavorful with big apple slices.  Now,I'm off to try this coconut pie. I gave it 5stars on pie rating only... not for anything else.",

    "text": "I decided to give this place a try after I got an email from Yelp on local restaurants serving comfort foods.  Location & Aesthetics -- located just off West Indian School Road on N 19th. Avenue which is somewhat behind the Burger King on West Indian School Road. There was good signage from the road (N 19th. Avenue) as you turn from West Indian School Road and not difficult to miss at all.  Parking lot is shared with other businesses and sadly parking was abysmal and limited as the parking lot was very small (-1).  On a busy evening/night I envision that finding a suitable parking spot near to the restaurant might pose an issue. Outside, front, and front lobby of the restaurant was clean including the restaurant itself.  Tables, table areas, and booths were clean. The only unclean area, and I mean really unclean, was the bathroom (-1).  Service -- as we entered, we were immediately greeted, seated, and provided with menus.  Immediately after, our waitress appeared to take drink orders.  As that was happening, we were provided with a complimentary basket of warm, sliced, hot bread with a generous serving of butter.  The complimentary bread was delicious and melted in your mouth and the butter was soft and creamy! After telling our waitress we needed some time for decisions on the drinks, it took her a while to return.  This was not only evident during the time it took to take our drink orders but also waiting on her to take our entree orders as well (-1). Someone in our party ordered a glass of milk and asked that it be warmed - it was barely tepid!  Another in our party ordered a cup of tea and even that too was barely tepid (normally I'd deduct a point here but sadly I don't have that many to deduct)!  Menu -- very simple (a 4-pager), straightforward and comprehensible that really didn't really require any questions from any one of us in our party except maybe for what was the soup of the day.  Food -- sadly this is where the restaurant really falls on as the food was very vapid!   I ordered the chicken fried steak with green beans and corn on the cob which came with the soup of the day - chicken noodle. To start, at least the chicken noodle soup was warm enough, it wasn't very salty, and tasty with enough noodles and chicken though there were some small chicken bones in the soup.   The corn on the cob wasn't a full earn of corn and looked rather depressing with the kernels not looking full or bursting yellow. The green beans tasted as if they were from a can and was too heavily glazed with oil on them.  Neither did they taste fresh nor crunchy! Lastly the chicken fried steak wasn't thick and was more crust/batter than steak in my opinion with minimal seasoning on the batter (-1).  Personally I will not return for the food but may return (possibly for takeout) for one of their delectable looking pies which I happened to gander while one of the waitresses was passing around on her way to a table. Sadly I cannot recommend!",

    "text": "Simple, home cooked American fair. Served in huge portions, in a nondescript strip mall behind a gas station.   Just north of bustling 19th Ave and Indian School, this family style restaurant has been dishing up delicious meals like chicken fry, pot roast, and steak since 1977.   Parking can be a bit difficult, especially if they're busy, but there is a large shopping area next door with a huge parking lot if you don't mind a walk. Each time I have come in I've been seated quickly, though there is clearly a large waiting area when you first walk in, including an old Pac man table top game.   Each meal comes with a choice of soup or salad from their salad bar, and one or two sides (mashed potatoes, French fries, mixed veggies, and the like) and each entree is large enough to sate two people's appetite. I've yet to try an appetizer (soup or salad comes immediately after ordering) and I haven't tried any of their deserts though the slices of pie are at least as large as the portion of meat you get with dinner.   Quality is good, food is simple but delicious, full bar with cheap beers, and a homie atmosphere. Can be a bit loud and definitely gets busy during the weekday lunch rush but more than worth it for food just like mom used to make (not mine but thankfully someone's haha).",

As you walk in to \"Mothers\"  you can't help but notice the glass cases of delicious looking pies immediately upon entering the restaurant.  The pies alone will  make you want to sit down and stay for a while.  This was my first visit to \"Mothers\" but it won't be my last.  The restaurant is clean, comfortable and has many tasty options to choose from. On this visit I ordered the open-faced turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy; what could be more delicious and satisfying?    The food is good and the portion size will not leave anyone hungry.  If there is still room after your entree, \"Mother's\" delicious pies await.  I recommend the peanut butter and chocolate cream pie.  So if you're ever in the mood for some good old fashioned comfort food  and find yourself in the area of  \"Mother's\" stop by you won't be disappointed.",

Parking was sparse, had to park in the next door parking lot in this very shady neighborhood. The place is very dated and shabby. I think there was actually construction going on (loud banging) as we dined that evening. Our waitress never returned to the table to ask if anyone needed refills on their drinks, my boyfriend had to get up and actually go to the machine to fill his own.  Now on to the food, there was something wrong with everyone's food in my party. I ordered the roasted chicken which was extremely dry, I sent that back and to no avail another dried up portion came back to me, my boyfriend ordered the pot roast which was also dry and cold, my daughter and her friend ordered the chicken tenders and french fries which was drenched in grease. When the manager was contacted a few days later all he said was \"something should have been said that night.\" Well I never!!! (And with the quality of their food I never will again)",

The gentleman that I spoke to on the phone while giving my order was very helpful and nice. He actually included a little sample of the mixed veggies for me to try to see if I liked them along with my meal. A+ customer service! The delivery guy was also super nice too.  The Food Lowdown:  I ordered the Pot roast lunch because I was craving something beef-y. The pot roast was tasty but fairly dry. The mashed potatoes were similar in that they were very tasty but without gravy (I don't like gravy) they were also pretty dry.  The mixed veggie sampling however was amazing! Perfectly blanched and covered in melted butter. I actually spooned the butter out and put it on my potatoes (YUMMY). I will definitely order these in the future.  In fact I'd order from My Mother's again. While things were on the dry side they were tasty and knowing that I can prepare in the future (a side of mixed veggies anyone?).   I'm looking forward to trying the turkey dinner soon.   (Delivery was reasonable, 9$ minimum and a 2.75$ delivery fee.)",

    "text": "Working evenings at Central and McDowell with no designated lunch break, our food choices are Blue Fin (if we get there before 6:30). CVS if we get there before 8, or having My Mother's, Siu Wok or pizza delivered.  No wonder I usually bring my own food from home!  I've ordered or tasted most everything on the menu (thanks, sharing co-workers!) - and it's all incredibly decent.  I can't say I've tried anything terrible - but it's very middle of the road, perfectly OK food.  A couple mentions for the plus side - the advertised big slice of pie is HUGE - a quarter of a pie, actually!  I don't do dairy, but have heard great reviews of the chocolate cream pie.  (I was told the banana creme was pretty much lacking banana flavor - but the creme was homemade and amazing, so still worth it.)  The other big plus - I ordered a BLT which came with obscene amounts of bacon.  I was expecting about half the bacon that ended up being there.  That alone is worth a star!  On the minus side - bread choices are white and weat hamburger buns and white sub rolls.  I wanted my BLT on sourdough.  Had to settle for a white bun.  Not ideal, but not a deal breaker if you know about it going in. A couple weeks ago, I ordered the peach pie, available seasonally.  They did not have any.  HELLO?  Mid to late May in Phoenix?  It is PRIMO peach season if you're looking for the freshest you can get.  Which is really two minuses - the lack of pie I wanted AND showing they don't care about sourcing locally.  I'll continue patronizing My Mother's.  Like I wrote above - haven't gotten anything BAD.  But it will likely be for delivery when Chinese and pizza just aren't calling to my tastebuds.  I don't see a reason I'd go out of my way to dine in the restaurant - especially with so many great CenPho choices, I won't go out of my way for mediocrity.",

Big portions and great service! Theresa was our server and you can just tell she loves her job! She sings, whistles and dances her way over to your table and she will even crack a joke to make you laugh. Superb!  For dinner we had the Prime rib with mashed potatoes and green beans, the meat loaf with mashed potatoes and green beans, the house bread, and a trip to the salad bar complimentary with dinner. ALL YUMMY!  The salad bar has a nice variety, I like peas on my salad and fresh peas they had indeed. The bread was warm and soft and yummy. The entrees were hot and perfect the way they came, not over salted or under spiced. My boyfriends prime rib was perfectly rare just the way he likes it.  For dessert we had pie, what a great way to top off a tasty dinner! As for our check, $44. We were very surprised and pleased at the cost. We will definitely be back again!!",

The rib was juicy and tender but a little on the bland side and I was glad the straight horse radish came with it to help season it. Portion size was good, mashed potatoes were real but served with turkey or chicken gravy, I couldn't tell. As for the green beans, they were typical canned and heated variety reminiscent of the old days of Furrs cafeteria. The salad bar was clean and nicely stocked, try the blue cheese dressing, and dinner was served with a warm sweet tear apart dinner roll. Did the meal impress me? Kinda. I would eat here again when looking for a meal to remind me of how my mother used to cook, no pun intended. Good value and good service.",

The restaurant 's ambiance is out of the past, but it was clean and the service was good. I ordered a turkey pot pie with one trip to the salad bar. my partner ordered the half roasted chicken dinner. Bread came to the table first. God..it was fresh and tasty..really home made. The food arrived promptly . Their was enough food to feed four people. The Turkey pot pie was huge . I actually had large chunks of white meat turkey, potatoes, carrots, a few peas (thank god) It was hot. The crust was good .Only criticism would be that it was a bit dry and the crust could have been more flaky like a pie crust. The chicken was perfect...dressing was like thanksgiving. veggies all good. added coconut cream pie ..one piece...it was ok..a bit dense and the crust was not flaky. All this with tea was 27 bucks. A good meal at a fair price. the pot pie made DUCE and ESSENCE pot pies look and taste like crap. hats off to this place. If you are hungry and with limited funds....this is a great <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fplace.by&s=12b9ba53c1d2652af2a09901d7299c738dfe25e6f959e09043b0c94aaa25394c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">place.by</a> the way...the salad bar was clean and the lettuce was fresh and not limmpy...good things to put on the salad. impressive for the price. will go back.",

    "text": "How did I forget to write a review for this place when I first joined yelp? Oh wait I know why, I did not want everyone packing this place resulting in no more delicious food for me LOL. I know I was being selfish but hey even food detectives have their little secrets. I was first introduced to this place back in 2004 by a guy I used to hang out with.   He promised me that nothing but good things would be found in this small and darkly lit place ( kind of got this feeling that I was in the restaurant scene from the godfather and  that I was not going to come out alive LOL). What this place lacks in updated decorations it definitely makes up with it's food.  First off if you have spent most of your life eating those hard as a rock rolls that everyone makes during the holidays you were being done wrong. This place offers bread that is soft, warm, and has a slight sweetness that leaves you wanting more. It is like when you are a kid and you imagine what eating a cloud would be like seriously no joke. It is just plain goodness. As others have stated they do have a one trip to the salad bar rule which they will enforce so make sure to follow it.  This is to make sure that you save room for all the mouth watering food you are about to be served, and served, and served. No that was not a typo or me spacing out and coping the same thing over and over again. This place takes the mother name to heart. Mother is a sweet old women who believes in making sure you eat well and a lot lol. No one leaves this place hungry I can guarantee you that!   Huge portions of ribs, chicken, and even Fred Flintstone dino steaks fill the menu and your stomach until you feel like you are going to bust. Topped off with a glass of sweet tea and you have one of the best meals in the valley. OK so it is out of the way for some and yes it does look like a place that may have been really popular in the 1950-70's but that just means they spend more time making the food taste so good. After all do you go to a restaurant to look at their selection of chairs or to eat LOL.  If nothing else you have to try the pie this place cranks out. If you always wanted to have a grandma who made you cookies but had the one who always bought ones from the store this is your chance to see what you have been missing. I recommend the banana cream pie ( oh wait, on second thought try the other ones banana is my fav). Their pies are creamy, and will make you almost think about packing up and moving closer to this place if you do not already live near by. The point is try this place and make sure you do as the old saying goes \"do not judge a book by it's cover or you may miss out on some really good food.  Case closed",

Staff are friendly, and have, on more than one occasion, accommodated my request to be seated in the back dining room so my hearing-impaired mother, could enjoy a little more quiet atmosphere.

The chicken fried steak is huge and so tender you don't need a knife to cut it. I always get mine with mashed potatoes. I get the excellent brown gravy on the potatoes and country gravy on thr steak. Everything they do is homemade. The country gravy has bacon in it and the brown gravy tastes like their tender, juicy roast beef. You can also get a Midwestern classic called an open face roast beef or turkey sandwich. It's just meat, mashed potatoes, gravy and bread they make themselves. It's the ultimate comfort food.  The waitstaff has all been there for years and they know all the regulars. Our family favorite waitress is Teresa. She's fast, friendly and remembers what we drink and what we order.  Every dinner, the table gets a loaf of fresh baked sliced bread. I recommend asking for honey butter with it. If you get the salad bar, try the blue cheese dressing. It's not the watered down bottled stuff, it's the good stuff with actual cheese chunks in it.  The decor is half old school family Italian restaurant, half 70's diner. There's a grape arbor with fake plastic grapes in the main dining room and a vintage Pac-Man game in the lobby. For me, it's like a second home. I'm just comfortable whenever I go there.",

    "text": "My co-worker and I have this thing about \"what are we doing for lunch today\". It's a pinky and the brain banter-type of conversation we have daily. It's quite comical. So today, he opened his Urban Spoon app, shook his phone and out popped My Mother's Restaurant. Being the adventurous types that we are, we said, \"what the hell\", let's do it. He had a hankering for comfort food anyway. So off we went. I must say, first impression was: boy this place is old and country-like. The decor just takes you into the country instantly. From the time you sit down, you should have a pretty good idea of what to expect.  Then come the menus. We chose and there comes a basket of fresh, warm, wheat loaf bread.. the best I've tasted in forever. We had the lunch specials. I tried the chicken fried steak and my partner had the turkey with stuffing. It was oooohhhh sooooo yuuummmm.  I don't normally order desert, but I HAD to take a slice of apple pie back to the office so I could consume it with much joy once it cooled down (I do not like warm pie). The pie was DELISH! Well worth the 4.99 for the 1lb slice.  My partner actually got upset that we had not been to My Mother's before today. We are definitely making another trip soon.  The food came out quick, but we still ended up going just over an hour, so plan ahead if you're on a time crunch for lunch.",

It's the dressing that we can't stomach, just way too much celery.  Overpowers everything!  The reason I give them a two star review, is because no matter how hard we try to explain our order in simple terms, repeat, confirm, they almost always get it wrong. At least 40% of the time we end up with dressing when we clearly say we want no dressing. Apparently there are mysterious rules and methods for ordering extra gravy that we cannot fathom. Sometimes we get charged for it, sometimes we get charged double for it, mystery pricing is always an effect on whatever we order to go.  We even quit going for a while in hopes that it would get better. After a hiatus we ordered again tonight, and lo and behold, dressing on both of the turkey plates. Their food is good, but it's not worth the aggravation.   It's a shame too, because we really do want to frequent the place.",

I was craving some chocolate cream pie and this place popped up in my search with some positive reviews so we decided to check it out, and I couldn't have been more pleased. It was the absolute perfect chocolate cream pie and I honestly don't think there's a lot out there who can compete. The crust was flaky and buttery and perfectly complimented the chocolate cream filling. Might I add that the sliced are a generous QUARTER of the entire pie. So there's that too.  So we definitely found our new spot for pie and playing cards. This place has such a 'homey' feel and you can tell it's been around for a long time - in a good way!",

And if that's what fresh apple pie tastes like, then I'd rather chew on expired canned apple pie filling. On the phone the man said yes our pizza dough is fresh, not frozen, bologna!

Okay, by now you're probably thinking, \"Well the diameter of the pie must be small.\"  Oh snap!  You hit me with the geometry.  I don't know the diameter of their pies, okay, because by the time I think about the measurements of the slice (just to gauge how much I've actually eaten) it's already in my stomach.

I declined the offer to go to salad bar for an extra $1.75. They brought out their amazing warm homemade sliced bread and I had a couple slices because yum. Then my cheesey amazingness arrived along with some marinara sauce. I had a few of the deliciously breaded cheese sticks before my meal arrived. The teriyaki chicken did not have sauce but the chicken was very moist and deliciously made with teriyaki flavor and the mashed potatoes were heavenly. Nice moist homemade goodness. After that I needed a box for the mozzarella sticks and I got a piece of chocolate peanut butter pie to go... which was amazing! $9 just about for the chicken lunch and $5 for the giant slice of pie. The minus one star is for the high prices... I think $6 or $7 max would be more appropriate for the lunch combos. But food is 6 stars at least.",

    "text": "The first time we had My Mother's Restaurant was months ago. My husband and I were feeling homesick, and being from Illinois we got excited when we saw that My Mother's Restaurant had deep dish \"Chicago Style.\" It was such a lie and a huge let down. The pizza was not deep dish,  it was not \"Chicago Style,\" rather it was thick crust. It was so thick that we could not taste the topping, just the crust.  --------------------- Last night we decided to give this place another try since our favorite pizza restaurant was closed. After being on hold for almost 10 minutes right off the get go (which was no big deal since they were busy), my husband finally got to talk to someone. He had to repeat the pizza topping order twice, and the buffalo wings four times. They told us 35-45 mins since they were busy.   When the delivery finally came, we were starving and I was really looking forward to their wings (I had been craving buffalo wings for weeks now).  The pizza was okay, the topping were correct but the dough was a little on the dry side. Now for the wings I had been craving, that came with a side of ranch and celery. They sent us the wrong one. They sent BBQ, and not the buffalo that we wanted, even after my husband repeated himself four times.   I've heard that their other food is great but after last night's dinner being such a failure, we will never be ordering from this restaurant again. We've been disappointed with them twice now.   We like to support local restaurants, we won't be supporting this one.",
