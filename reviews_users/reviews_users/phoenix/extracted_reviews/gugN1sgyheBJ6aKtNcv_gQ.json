For entrees, we had the bacon pancakes and the 50/50 burger, 50% beef / 50% bacon with a side of fries. For dessert, we enjoyed bacon donut holes, pretty much the best baked treat I've ever had! Service was excellent (Thanks, Lana!) and we enjoyed our meal greatly! Also, there is a Half-Price Books right next door, highly recommended!!",

It was good, not great.  My bacon was not cooked evenly (some pieces were barely done, and one piece was burnt).  It was good and I could distinguish the flavors.  The Strawberry Cheesecake pancakes were awesome though.  Service was great, friendly and courteous.  I would come back, but give specific directions on how to cook my bacon.",

    "text": "I've been here a handful of times and each time my experience has been average.  I primarily continue to come here because it's only a few blocks from my house and it's an easy place to meet clients for meetings. However, having said all of that, I highly doubt I'll be back after my experience this morning.  I arrived this morning to read the paper and relax.  I always order the huevos rancheros because it's always been good to me.  I've had clients who have ordered other items on the menu and have been very disappointed (I have had two friends order a dish that came with a biscuit--each time, the biscuits had the consistency of a rock).  Anyway, for whatever reason, I decided to live dangerously and order something else.  I ordered the egg white omelet with home fries and whole wheat toast.  It arrived and was nothing unique or off-the-charts.  But hey, it tasted good.  After I was done polishing that off, I still had a hankering (yeah, that's right--a hankering) for something else.  Considering how full I was, I needed something small.  I remembered seeing blueberry pancakes on the menu, so I asked my server how many came with a side order.  He told me a stack of two or four. I asked him if they were gigantic and he said no, they were typical pancakes.  I put in an order for two.  When they arrived they looked good, but like everything else here, were nothing special.  Imagine my surprise when I cut into the short stack and realized only one of them had blueberries in it.  Oh well, what the hell; I ate them both.  After many attempts to get a coffee refill (I was seated on the patio--if you like refills, don't sit there) I gave up and looked at the check.  (Side note: The servers here immediately give you the check after your food arrives.  Their reasoning is that they don't want you to have to wait for the check.  I don't buy it.  I feel rushed when they do this. In fact, they tell you \"No rush\" when they put it on the table, so clearly I'm not the only one that has wondered about this.)  The check was pretty straightforward, except for the charge related to my two blueberry pancakes (sans blueberries).  For some reason, my server accidentally charged me for the blueberry pancake meal, or so I thought, since he charged me $6.99 for the dish.  I asked about it, and guess what?  It was not a mistake.  This place has the audacity to charge $7 for TWO PANCAKES!!!  What the heck is in them that they cost $3.50 a piece?  Before I wrote this review, I called IHOP  (yes, IHOP--they're across the street from Oink, so they're competition and the food quality is comparable) and asked them how much their double blueberry pancake side costs.  A stack of two costs $3.79 and a stack of four costs $6.99.  Can you explain that to me?  Same size, same ingredients, same zip code, hell, the same street, but Oink charges DOUBLE!  Anyway, considering the outrageous prices, the average service (servers are nice, but not very quick with the refills, or anything else, except the check), and the average/slightly above average food, I feel like I can do better.  IHOP, here I come!",

I got a waffle which was actually very good. The wait staff was non existent. I waited 10 minutes for a water refill. When we gave our name we told them 2 and a high chair. The manager seated us and told us there were no high chairs- as we passed a table with 2, I told him we'd have to go elsewhere and magically there were plenty of highchairs. We ordered a bacon flight. I will say it was all good and cooked the right way- not some crunchy dog treat like some restaurants. I highly recommend the jalapeno bacon! With hickory and pecan wood tied for second. My husband was sure to have his card out when the wait staff appeared, we didn't know how long it would be if she had to make another trip.",

The front area used to have a good display of deserts and bacon-infused food, but that's gone. I tried their donut made with bacon last time and that was yummy, that's why I returned but it's not a highlight anymore. I ordered the eggs benedict and it was blah...very dry. Hope to find another restaurant that really capitalize on the PIG...bacon especially. That's what the name OINK is, duh!!!",

My favorite so far is the Oink Breakfast Burger and the Sweet Potato Fries. The service is usually slow. It's a very busy place and I'm an understanding person so it doesn't really bother me much but for someone in a rush it's probably not going to be a good choice for you. Good luck getting a refill on your water. My husband ordered the steak and eggs last time and he asked for his steak to be cooked medium well. When he got it the steak was more like medium rare...super pink and undercooked. So he was upset about that. The manager did offer to bring him a new dish, so that was nice.  Main reason we keep coming back is that we live so close. It's a decent breakfast, definitely better than Denny's.",

Not the best set up if you're there by yourself because everybody's staring at you and makes for awkward dining experience.  Some of the wait staff are very rude, and yet some are very friendly. I saw they automatically gave every other table in the place free glasses of water. I didn't get any free glasses of water. I wish some of the rude wait staff would quit or get fired, because they give the place a bad rep. They do have a good manager who is helpful with customer requests.   Good mix of customers. Not too many old people, not too many kids, not too many business people there, just a good mix of customers. I didn't feel uncomfortable or out of place there. Will probably be back.",

She talked to the server while he was trying to seat us about what he was doing and also our server while she was trying to take an order about the tv. Super unprofessional. On top of that some people came in after us and sat at a empty dirty table outside. Instead of seating actual people on their list the manager or owner women came out and gave them menus knowing they had sat themselves. I won't be back for this reason. I am a paying customer who knows how to actually wait until my name is called and they allow others just to seat themselves. Also the women ridiculing the server and hostess in front of us was really uncomfortable.",

    "text": "The PV Mall area is in desperate need of a good breakfast joint. You can get Matt's if you go downtown and there are now multiple Over Easy's around the east valley. Unfortunately, this place isn't it. I'm wondering if the 5 star reviews have this place mixed up with another place. Let me first say I think they are trying but if you are bold enough to have a \"Bacon Lovers Entrance\" then you better deliver. Everyone was friendly and we seated promptly. My boy had the kids pigs in a blanket and I had the two egg breakfast.   Before I jump ahead I should back up a bit. Coffee... I love good coffee and for $2.29 I expect some tasty premium coffee. No such luck. Burnt and rather acidic this is the kind of swill you get at Denny's. Am I being too picky if I don't like to have the little Shamrock farms containers on the table?  Fresh cream please. You are competing to be the go to breakfast place for the neighborhood.   Back to the food. My 2 eggs, over medium, were serviceable and prepared as expected.  The hash browns were super salty and even the egg yolk couldn't make them tasty. Not good at all. I had the applewood smoked bacon. I got 2 flimsy pieces that probably were cooked 4 or 5 hours ago and were burnt around the edges. They were also appeared to be about 1/2 the size of a normal piece of bacon. This is a bacon place and you serve this?  My Kirkland Signature precooked bacon at home placed in the oven for 10 minutes is way better. Seriously how can you serve this?  English muffin was OK. Everything probably sat for 5-7 minutes before it got to me. Not cold but not just off the griddle either. My son's \"Pigs in a Blanket\" we're worse. The pancakes were crumbly like a biscuit. They had a strange consistency that really was like a sweet biscuit. The Pigs inside of the blanket were of the Brown N Serve variety or whatever the food supply company sells as a equivalent. Really not good.   How do you call yourself The Oink Cafe and serve these pork abominations?  I know their trying to give you a quality experience but with the pork products they're serving I don't think they are going to be around.",

    "text": "Of course, every parent thinks their child is the cutest, smartest, best behaved and many other superlatives.  When we find a restaurant that shares our opinion of our just-turned 2 year old son, well, all the better.  If I could give them 10 stars for service, I definitely would.  We arrived at 10AM to meet our friends for Sunday brunch.  The restaurant was crowded and I was expecting a long wait for a table for 6 adults and the aforementioned toddler.  However, our wait was less than 5 minutes.  Our friends had been there before and ordered 2 flights of bacon for the table to share.  Most of the 8 varieties were good, some were OK and some were outstanding (it's bacon after all, even when it's meh, it's still pretty good).  My favorites were the jalapeno and the pecan wood.  My least favorite was the apple cider, I felt the cider just didn't add anything to the flavor experience.  I ordered the Paradise Valley omelette with fruit and an english muffin.  I thought it was a very nice extra that you got so many choices for sides with the omelettes.  The PV option comes with bacon, mushrooms, spinach and cheese.  The omelette was one of the best I have had in years.  There were two reasons for this.  First, the mushrooms and spinach, both vegetables with high water content, had been properly cooked so they didn't drown the eggs.  Secondly, the ingredients were very evenly dispersed so with each bite, I got the full combination of all the add-ins.  Here's where Oink Cafe went above and beyond, IMHO.  We had visits from a manager and a lady who I assumed was the owner.  The male manager interacted with our son, acknowledging his birthday (our friends had brought him presents) and talking with him and the adults at the table.  The waitress also interacted with our son, refilling his water when he asked for more and treating him like a welcome guest, not some nuisance.  Finally, a lady who I assumed was the manager also stopped by.  She paid special attention to our son, even asking if she could bring him some more fruit when she realized he had eaten all of my side of fruit.  So glad our friends suggested OINK and already looking forward to another visit.  I'll definitely have to take the manager's suggestion of swapping out the regular bacon for the jalapeno bacon on a sandwich.",

There were countless numbers of tables open during our wait time. When asked when we'd be called the lady said they'd already seated us, someone took our table! They immediately sat us. Our server was fabulous and food was good but wait time for the food was a little ridiculous. The poor servers are inundated with not only serving their tables but making their own drinks... this takes away from their tables and makes the wait that much longer. The organization seems to lack. Someone needs to help with hostess, check in's and calling people to their seats, they need to hire a drink maker. Hopefully we can give it a try again but not looking good.",

I told my server upfront that I'd be hanging out for a bit and to keep the coffee coming. She did! With a name that includes \"oink,\" you should already know that this place is centered around bacon. I however, did not partake of the bacon -- not my cup of tea. Yeah, yeah, yeah....I'm THAT girl who walks in and orders a veggie omelet with more veggies on the side. They accomodated me just fine and didn't give me any weird looks for not ordering bacon.  The gals at the table next to me ordered a bacon donut for dessert. So this is an option if your bacon appetizer and bacon entree aren't enough.  Five stahs!",

    "text": "ONE star for cold breakfast food that has the potential to be much better.   The two of us took the open seats at the bar counter because the wait time for other tables was a usual 20 minutes (no, not long but we were on a schedule today so we needed to get in and out fairly quickly). As other reviewers recently posted, I'm not sure why there was much of a wait at all since there were 6 others tables open to seat customers. Strange.   We waited over 30 minutes for our food to come out only to be significantly disappointed by what we bit into. Neither of our Benedicts were even lukewarm and the bacon that is \"raved\" about was certainly nothing special. If you are going to feature a specialty item such as a bacon tasting board it better be something memorable! This was anything but that- very lightly flavored and pretty thin. We both said to each other that our food would have been great if it were hot. It's a shame- these foodies won't be back and certainly won't recommend Oink.   Ours weren't the only gripes- we overheard the staff quietly noting how many complaints there were today. I just don't get it. Breakfast is the easiest meal to cook. Management needs to get this place together!!!  Also was quite turned off by one of the back-of-the-house fellas that frequented the front bar area with a cigarette hanging behind the ear- SOO unappealing. What if that fell in someone's food!?!!  Noting that although we had an unfortunate experience, we appreciated that management took our concerns seriously. Thank you for that.",

We tried the Bacon Flight, which was fun and tasty and definitely solidified that I will be returning for jalapeno bacon in their mac and cheese.   They had some of the best biscuits and gravy that I've had in Phoenix!   The food was good, the atmosphere was fun, the staff was really friendly.   In fact, the only \"complaint\" I have is that the service was *too* friendly. We could barely take a bite without someone coming by to ask us how our experience was. It was nice to feel cared about, but could have been toned down a bit. That being said, I've always wanted to check this place out and it did not disappoint!",

    "text": "Overall review?: go try EGGstasy.  So everything is homeade & pancakes were fluffy, the flight of bacon has 8 strips that don't have a lot of difference, you can taste the jalapeno and peppered bacon flavors but the sugar and honey cured weren't too different. The pecanwood and applewood were truly the only real flavored bacons that were different.    We ordered the florentine Benedict with honey cured bacon and strawberry pancakes, they were fluffy but not extraordinary. There was a bit of shortage on the sauce too.  Then they forgot the bacon on the Benedict so it tasted very plain until they brought the bacon which still just made it just... ok.  In summary, you could probably make a similar breakfast at home. If you want a special Benedict, do any of them from EGGstasy if you plan to wait 30-40 minutes on any day & the same goes to pancakes.  You could go to butter fields for better pancakes too.  There's just not any \"you must stop here\" for bacon or breakfast per the wow factor that is out there.  Not sure what they made for the guy from cnn...  The server was great but seating took quite awhile... I think that's more due to people camping out. They were busy in the beginning but there was plenty of people to ask how things were afterwards- and while we told them they said \"next time we'll bring you more sauce\".  I guess that's ok... Still nothing I'll be back for sadly.",

But the server, Tami,  informed me they were too busy, since it's a weekend, to make me any. Disappointing. We left another restaurant with a long wait to come here. The other restaurant offers way more GF options. Anyway I ordered the two egg breakfast with hash browns and GF toast. My friend had biscuits and gravy. The order came out within minutes so it's clear they were not made to order. Not on a busy Saturday. I will say that the eggs were good but my hash browns were cold. The server did ask is how everything tastes but it was moments after our food came and we hadn't had time to try anything yet! I think the service is hit or miss. The food is decent. I'll probably come back but honestly a few things could be tweaked.",

    "text": "\"Bippity Boppity Bacon\". I wonder how Jim Gaffigan would feel about this cute 'lil joint?  When you walk in through the main entrance, you will notice the lovely patio and a walk up window (love it) where you can place a take-out order. Creative, but if you are going to wait for your order, I would recommend snagging one of the four seats at the inside counter where you can enjoy a coffee or espresso drink and salivate at the delicious-looking pastrie, some of which, are bacon flavored.  The walls are painted bright yellow, green, and orange, with fun wall art of various pigs. In addition to the four counter seats, there is plenty of seating between the green booths and tables, but if you have a party of five or larger, your only option is to push together the tables and sit in the uncomfortable looking wood chairs. Luckily, I was just there with my madre so we got to enjoy a comfy booth.  We were greeted and seated immediately by friendly staff and a few seconds later our waitress greeted us and took our drink orders. I ordered a latte that wasn't anything special (no latte art either), but hey, they don't advertise about their espresso, so no biggie. I opted for their half of sandwhich and soup or salad deal. I chose their BLT with applewood smoke bacon and a side salad, just so I don't clog up all my arteries. My mom went for the full BLT sandwhich with sweet potato fries. There area few bacon options to choose from like: applewood smoke, honey cured, sugar cured, peppered, and jalapeno bacon, but our server suggested to stay with the classic applewood smoked, so we listened. The sandwich was pretty tasty and they don't skimp on the yummy bacon, the side salad was boring and basic, but the sweet potato fries were delicious, good choice mom!  All in all, good service, decent food, reasonable prices. I would come back and try their bacon pancakes, which is what the server said they are known for, but I'm not in any rush. FYI: This place closes at 2pm everyday and isn't open at all on Tuesdays.",

Love to see that!    The menu is decent.  I'm not a huge breakfast person but there were quite a few items on the menu I was interested in.  The funny thing is my hubby and I ended up not ordering any bacon and didn't realize this until after we finished eating!  So we definitely will be going back to try the bacon they are known for....jalapeno bacon anyone!",

    "text": "The idea is great and what inevitably will get you to try Oink Cafe.  The hostess staff and most employees seem to have better things to do than be at work.  I ordered the BLT.  It is listed as one of their specialties. The waitstaff asked what type of bacon I wanted as they offer eight flavors.  I stated Applewood, but changed my mind and said, bring whatever you recommend.  The BLT came out in three layers of blah wheat bread.  I'm pretty sure it was a 99 cent loaf of bread and the bacon had no flavor at all.  The manager came around and asked how our lunch was, I told him it was okay.  He said just ok and I told him my thoughts; the meal was rather bland.  He said, hopefully, they can impress better my next visit.  They won't have that opportunity.  Where we can order bacon everything from specialty store, don't eat here if you want some Jimmy Dean packaged bacon.",

    "text": "This is another 3.5 rounded up to a 4. It gets the extra star because it's ranked rather low on Yelp right now. I'd avoided it before this for that reason, but one day decided to just take the plunge and check it out. After all, it specializes in bacon! Couldn't be that horrible, right?   It really is pretty decent. I went there on a Monday afternoon. The place was quiet- there were patrons, but I got seated right away. The wait staff were prompt, and my waitress was fabulous. Sweet and friendly and there with everything I needed. Very cute decor, they have that neat wood-looking tile all over, and the walls are BRIGHT chartreuse. I kid you not. Wear shades.   The menu itself is pretty simplistic. Don't expect anything revolutionary. It's got all the staples, benedicts, omelettes, chicken fried steak. I wound up going with their Denver omelette, subbing out the eggs for egg whites. They do allow you to get a pancake instead of toast. It's just one pancake, but I'm watching that waistline anyway. It was good. The Denver omelette had green peppers, spinach and bacon. Lots of bacon, they were super generous, which is awesome. The pancake was huge and fluffy- one was more than enough. They also have a drinks/cocktails menu, so I was able to indulge in a mimosa. Really nice, definitely appreciated that. They've even got a bacon bloody mary. I was tempted but stuck to my mimosa instead.  The last food item that I have to mention is their maple glazed bacon donut. Yes, you heard me right. Incredible. I brought it home for my husband and he inhaled it in foodgasmic delight. It's a deep fried cake donut with a maple glaze and tons of bacon. Tons. He gave me a bite- really quite good. So definitely get that!   All in all, a nice restaurant. I promised my husband I'd bring him back over when we can. It's not far from us, so we should be able to be by more often than some other brunch places I've reviewed.   Don't be put off by the low reviews. The service was good, the food was good, it really does deserve you stopping by at least once!",

My food was tepid and the Food Service Hash Browns were not crisped very well. Service was ok, bacon was tasty but cold.

    "text": "Ventured here this Sunday morning not realizing it was the opening weekend; was told they had just opened on Tuesday.  That being said, they definitely have a few kinks to work out.    They prevented customers from using the door on Cactus as an entrance (understandable to help with the traffic flow) but there was no signage indicating where the other entrance door was located.  Not a biggie, but a little strange.  After finding the sole entrance door, entered to find people standing around and no customer greeter. No seating for those waiting to be seated.  Someone eventually walked around and wrote our name on a wait list.    The place is \"cozy\" with several tables and booths closely located.  The decor was simple but nice.  Loved the glass garage door which I'm sure they'll open during appropriate weather.  Also noticed they had outdoor patio seating as well.  Only waited 10-15 minutes for seating, which was pretty good considering how busy they were.  Here's where things start to fail...   I ordered the signature \"Oink Omelet\" and the other 2 in my party ordered the pancake combo. Not sure what was happening in the kitchen but they will definitely need to work on expediting.  The waitress was nice but not very attentive.  For example, we asked for straws several times to no avail.  A young lady from the culinary school providing samples of their baked items was kind enough to finally retrieve some straws.  The waitress, understandably, looked a bit overwhelmed.  From my seat, I would see into the kitchen and see that things were somewhat amiss.  After our orders were taken, we had to wait at least 45 minutes for the food to arrive. The \"Oink Omelet\" consisted of 5 (yes, 5) eggs, sausage, ham and cheese... hehehe.. definitely an \"oinker\" and came with hash browns (or home fries) and toast (or english muffin).  I have to admit that was a very tasty omelet.  However, the pancake combos were not very impressive and almost reminded me of IHOP or Denny's.  However, I was told the pancakes were somewhat tasty but could have been better and the applewood bacon was good.  After all is said and done, I would still give this place another try again after they have been open for a while and get the kinks out...",

The other day we stopped in for lunch which I can only say was that is was just  \"ok\". My son ordered a waffle off the kids menu and they made him the adult size. I knew he couldn't eat it all but he was thrilled when it arrived. I ordered the turkey sandwich and found myself looking to make sure the turkey actually made it on to the sandwich. Had they just put on a little more I would have enjoyed it but there were sections of the sandwich that were meatless and there wasn't enough to spread out to cover the entire piece of bread. The fries were decent and the server was friendly and quick to refill our drinks when needed.  Maybe it was just an off day. Since our previous experiences have been good we will certainly give it another try.",

The signs walking up are descriptive and making me salivate for the bacon before I even walk in the door.  Looking at the menu I see there are several different bacon options and even a \"flight\" of bacon!!! Now most of us over 21 know a flight as a beer sampler with 4 or 5 different beers. But a Bacon flight... genius.   So after a mad cackling fit over the bacon flight I decide at 9am I must try the 50/50 burger. 50% ground beef and 50% ground bacon. Med is the lowest they will cook it due to the pork. Ok no problem. It comes out and I'm immediately drooling. Take a bite and I'm in heaven.  I ate half and was full. Took the other half for my 21 year old to have with his lunch. While I was sad the beautiful bacon aroma had left the car, I am happy to say I am still stuffed hours later.    I can't wait to return and try something else new.",

If you want to enjoy your amazing meal at Oink, specifically ask to avoid her section because she absolutely didn't deserve the 20% tip I left her out of courtesy because she basically made us feel like our table was a burden to her.

The sour dough toast was good too and not hard as a brick! The bacon was rubbery and limp, didn't even eat it.  Also ordered the \"flight of bacon\" which is one slice of each of the 8 flavors of bacon that they offer. Cost is $10.99 which was a waste of money.  Only 1 piece was thoroughly cooked (the jalapeno), the others were rubbery and undercooked.  Was very disappointed.  I mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to get another one, declined.  She said we should of asked for crispy bacon, that this is the way the bacon is always cooked.....hmmmmm.  Cost of entire meal was kinda high $50+ for 3 people (also we ordered the $10.99 \"flight of bacon\"), maybe go back for a special occasion.  Will go back, just won't have any bacon.",

It's worth checking out, maybe a more bacon centric dish will rock your world.  I would have been happier with a smaller more flavorful breakfast for the price. ~personal preference~",

I get weekends are busy. I've been in Scottsdale / Paradise Valley long enough to understand weekend wait times.  Here's the deal today.  Waited twenty minutes so far for a table with a lot of other people. As I stand here, there are NINE unoccupied, unbussed tables including FOUR that needed bussing when we arrived here twenty minutes ago.  Many others in town I won't name handle a far greater Sat/Sun load without issue.  I really want to like Oink but the front end mismanagement is terrible.  I've watched five parties walk away while we've been waiting. I'll go somewhere else from now on.",

The service here was sub par, it was really busy and a little longer wait is fine. Our waitress never returned to fill our drinks, never checked to see if we needed anything and had to be flagged down in order to get our check. Like I said they were busy and I'll gladly make exceptions for that but being completely ignored is unacceptable to me.   The food was only ok as well. We ordered a flight of bacon, which is supposed to be the backbone of the menu. All of the samples were good but none of them were great. In most cases I wouldn't be able to distinguish it from store bought bacon, with the peppered bacon as the exception.   Both of our breakfast items were ok, a little on the bland side. Nothing worth complaining about or sending back but also nothing that would make me come running back. Overall it reminded me of a small town greasy spoon diner that was trying desperately to be a trendy uptown bistro.",

It was the first time since leaving Ohio that we had great service. In fact our server was so good she was probably one of the best ones I've ever had. I didn't catch her name unfortunately but she was a really tall brunette.   She was so friendly right from the get go and you could tell she knows what she's doing. It was almost like she was reading my mind with the coffee I wanted, even offered to give me a cup to go. My boyfriend and I were so stressed from the road and being in a new place that we weren't that high-spirited when we came in and she made my day.  And the food was delicious! I got the oink omelette and he got the Arizona omelette and pancakes and we loved our food. The fruit was really good too. My omelette was even good reheated. I only got through 1/4 of it so I had plenty of leftovers to eat later on. The sauce on the Arizona omelette was so good that I snagged some from my boyfriend's plate to use on mine. I will definitely be back there and hopefully get that same server because she was phenomenal",

Oh, and may I have a menu please?\" IMO I shouldn't have to ask for that. She should have brought it over when she realized I was new to the table. Whatever. I wasn't really, REALLY hungry yet anyway.   I looked over the menu and by the time she delivered my water I had already decided on the eggs plate with jalapeno bacon. The food was pretty bland. I doused it in pepper and chollula and a bit of salt. Also, if your gimmick is bacon, you had better be damn good at it! The jalapeno bacon was definitely nothing to write home about and a friend who had ordered the bacon flight was only moderately impressed. Definitely not worth the cost in this case. Oh well. What are ya gonna do? Oh I know. Not order that again. The French toast looked yummy and if I lived on this side of town I might bring my sonny man back for breakfast.

Despite the simplicity of our orders we still had to wait 40-50 minutes for food. That's pretty much where the disappointment begins:  - several tables that were seated after us, got their food before us.  - they forgot to bring my place setting a couple of times - Ordered has browns extra crispy.  They weren't crispy, they were just cold when they arrived =( -they forgot my english muffin -the Jalepeno bacon I was super excited about, tasted like.. regular unflavored bacon.. and it was soggy =/.   For a place named Oink, at the very least you'd expect the bacon to be good right? wrong =/.  I wouldn't come here for food again, but maybe alcohol haha.

The woman at the front desk of my hotel said hands down Oink was the place to go if I wanted a good local spot. She was so right! A place with 8 types of bacon on the menu had to be at least okay, right?! The service was good, everyone was very sweet and attentive.  I got the pork confit omelet and it was good. The pork was super tender and really well seasoned. It's a ton of food, omelet toast and a side of your choice. I got the ranchero sauce on the side and I'm glad I did because it was spicy so I don't know I would have wanted it on top of all my omelet. As a sweet treat I got the maple bacon donut, woah baby! It was served nice and warm was cakey and had some nice cinnamon spicing to it, it was a little dry but I was there closer to lunch and I hadn't had a donut in a couple years so I didn't mind.  Overall good breakfast spot!",

The bacon doughnuts & flavored bacons stand out and are delicious.  However, one of their signature dishes, the pork confit, was very dry & bland. Other than that, I have not had a bad meal & have eating breakfast there for about a year.  If you go on a Saturday or Sunday morning, be prepared to wait 45-60 minutes for a table.",

    "text": "The wife and I decided to visit this locale this morning because it is only about a 5 minute or less walk from our Apartment. I have read every review on here pertaining to this establishment and most of it remains True despite the fact it has been almost 2 weeks since it has been open. We arrived at about 11:00am and we were seated fairly quickly. The server came pretty quickly and got us some water and I had the coffee which is just average.   It took us about 5 to 7 minutes to decide what to order and the server took our order at about 11:15am. I ordered the Pancake Combo with one egg scrambled....and turkey sausage. My wife had the Chorizo and eggs which came with home fries. So after about 30 minutes waiting for our food to arrive.....the owner or manager....which was an elderly lady... came out to each table an apologized for the long wait and offered us some oink cookies. She explained that when they were planning the business structure that she was told there would be several customers in the area that would come to this type of establishment. However there have been hundreds of people showing up and they were not prepared for that.  She also expressed there have been some issues with the cooking staff....arguing back and forth about who should be preparing what....and how it should be prepared....there are some huge communication issues that need to be worked out. Finally at about 12:05pm we finally received our food....so that means it took about an hour from the time we first ordered. Now since we live so close to this establishment I didn't mind the wait.....however had I come say 20 minutes away....I wouldn't want to wait an hour to have breakfast.   The Food was OUTSTANDING.....DELICIOUS.....AWESOME.....so there were no problems in this area at all. Now if this establishment can just get better organized....because we had to ask for silverware.....napkins....straws....and butter for my pancakes.....and get the communication issues squared away in the kitchen....this will be a guaranteed 5 star establishment. So by all means if your in the east valley and are looking for a place to have a GREAT TASTING....MADE TO ORDER breakfast....give the Oink Cafe a try. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!  NOTE: Just another FYI the elderly lady came back after we finished our breakfast and offered us a wonder piece of sour creme pecan coffee cake....so she was really trying to make customers feel comfortable and apologize for our wait. You have to appreciate that kind of service and her honesty about the situation....I truly believe this place will have great success once they fix some of there issues!!!!",

    "text": "Here is my pigtail.   When I can, I will stop in a new restaurant, meet and greet the owners and look over the menu to see something traditional and something new. What catches my eye here is the bacon. You know bacon will never let you down.  I learn from the owner that he hires the chef, over several qualifications but will have to cook one meal to get the job. So I decide to order the job winning meal.   I was really not all that interested in testing chef's speed, artistry and creativity, nope I want a winter savory meal representing his interpretation of the classic Eggs Benedict $9, and a side of jalapeno bacon $3.   Everybody enjoys a surprise ingredient and the jalapeno heat in the bacon was a winner. The flavor of the Hollandaise sauce was rich and buttery with that ever so slight lemon tang. The perfect poached egg too.  Lunch the next day I had a club sandwich. A excellent sandwich born from the remnants of many delicious things. Three slices of thin white toast, choice of bacon and I chose honey bacon since I already enjoyed jalapeno bacon the previous day. Lettuce, tomato, honey cured ham, turkey and a little mayo and spices. There are three choices of fries, regular, thick and sweet. This meal is very large. $8. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gugN1sgyheBJ6aKtNcv_gQ?selected=UAcma3FjSfkUnnRZkvLGyA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gugN...</a>  One last note, the meats are oven cooked in this kitchen, roast beef next up. The staff and the owners are kind and thoughtful. There are plenty of pros to dining here and I have yet to see a con.",

It's in a location where 'The Eggery' was in Paradise Valley for a long, long time and they were very busy and successful.  Several places have come and gone since then... and for some reason, I'm really routing for Oink, but they have a lot of work to do.   The parking is not exactly the best.   I would HIGHLY recommend you park in the EAST parking lot rather than the SOUTH.   If you enter from the south entrance, you have to walk all the way to the back (er, um, front?) of the restaurant to only walk back where you came from to be seated.  A little awkward, but I didn't learn my lesson from the first time I was there.     There is a cute little patio area that I hope they utilize someday... love sitting outside!    The restaurant atmosphere is a little sparse, but since it's just starting out, I hope they add more to the decor- because I love nice ambiance.   Right now it's bland and boring.     The food is great!  My co-workers enjoyed piled high sandwiches and build your own omlettes which they really liked.  I've tried their bacon cheeseburger, which was so good the first time, that I ordered it again.  Yes, I'm boring.   I also ejoyed their sweet potato fries.  If you're going to try this place... be sure to go with a huge dose of patience.  These girls are REALLY trying to get it right.  They are very pleasant, but I just don't think they've gotten their groove yet on service.      Ladies, work smarter, not harder.  For instance, grab silverware when you grab the menus, so you're not back and forth and running over yourself.    Maybe even have a service station closer to the back (er, um, front?) of the restaurant.  It's a long jaunt back and forth.   Anyways, I wish you the best of luck.  It has a great food with great potential!",

    "text": "Staying at my sister's place while visiting the Valley for Thanksgiving, and of course she didn't have any food, certainly no breakfast grub.  Google Maps tells me that one of the nearest breakfast joints is Oink Cafe, and based on the name alone, I felt we should try it out.  Since it was a nice morning, my lady and I walked the relatively short distance to give it a shot.    It was a lot bigger than I expected, I guess I was picturing some little hole-in-the-wall with grease everywhere and some grumpy old lady slinging bacon everywhere in an effort to appease the hungry masses crammed into the place.  No, it was spacious and clean.  The menu was typical, except for the flight of bacon.  I love beer, and routinely get flights of beer when they are available, but I am not a huge fan of bacon and don't feel the need to try all 10 (or whatever) varieties of bacon this place has.  I'm sure plenty of people do, but I felt it was a silly novelty.    I ordered the chorizo and eggs, my lady had a ranchero omelet.  She ordered it without onions, it came out with hella onions, but the server was very friendly and attentive and took it back and it was quickly replaced with the correct version without the evil onions.  My fiancee also had a Bloody Mary (with bacon) and raved about it.  I don't dig on Bloody Mary's so I was unimpressed, but she said it was one of the best she's had in a long time.  My food was delicious, especially the side of jalapeno bacon I ordered.  Yeah, I know, I said I don't love bacon, but I figured I had to try one of the flavors.  Good God, the jalapeno bacon was incredible.  It was just the right amount of spice to liven up an otherwise drab piece of fatty meat.  It almost made wish that I had ordered the flight, just to see if the other flavors were as delicious.  Almost.    The service was friendly, quick, and attentive.  The atmosphere was a little bit stale because it lacked intimacy, but there is plenty of hand-colored pig art adorning the walls to occupy your time.  Overall, it was a very pleasant breakfast experience, much better than finishing off the stale box of cereal at my sister's place.",

I got a half flight of bacon (4 pieces - applewood, honey, sugar and apple cider). The only one that tasted any different from its brothers was the apple cider. I'm not sure if I actually liked it or just likes the fact it didn't taste the same.  I got the bacon benedict. It looked good, and the hash towns weren't bad (if very plain). The bacon was very hard, and the sauce was way too thick. It was also honestly kind of tasteless. My mother and daughter both had French toast and enjoyed it, however.  Just for fun we ordered a bacon donut on our way out. Granted I didn't eat it until a few hours after we'd left (kids, whatcha gonna do?), but I didn't find it very good either.

It's always a minimum 20 minute wait to get seated and then when you're seated, it takes another 10 to get your drink and then another 10 for your order.   Personally they need to add wait staff. They are working far too many tables per waiter/waitress. If they added 2 to a shift, they could churn people in and out of here. Bus boys wouldn't hurt either.

It was very tender but the sauce was pretty limiting.   Bf had omelette. It was the five egg omelette which was huge but it looked pretty sparse to me in toppings. We also has a bacon donut which is really crunchy but wasn't warmed or anything so that kind of fell flat. Way too sweet. Skip the syrup with it but it might be too dry otherwise.",

    "text": "Our breakfasts at The Oink Cafe (Paradise Valley) were delicious and accompanied by super tasty bacon and sausage sides. I wanted to sample a variety of their bacons, so I ordered a basic breakfast of two eggs with hash browns, then added a half-flight (4 pieces) of bacon, and 2 sausage links.  I was in Heaven! My wife ordered the Oink French Toast Combo with a sweet crumb crust topped with whipped cream and strawberry sauce, berries and sugar, plus an egg with bacon. She savored every bite!  They also serve espresso drinks, premium beer, and cocktails - especially Bloody Marys. Everything is fresh and service is very good.  Definitely recommended.",

    "text": "We have been wanting to come here for quite some time now! So with us being able to squeeze in a Sunday brunch, we were finally able to come here. The wait was long and I believe we were quoted 20 minutes but I believe it was closer to 30 minutes. Once seated we were taken very good care of by our waitress. And, with that said that is my biggest complaint! If you have read any of my reviews in the past then you know I don't like to waste calories on bad food. Lucky for me this was a winning meal all around. Unbutton your top button on your pants and enjoy the ride. Eat like a pig if you want! You only live once! With that in mind, we went full fledge into the menu! We ordered the 10 piece bacon flight that featured 10 different bacon slices. Ok, we shared it! My absolute favorites were the Jalapeno, apple cider and the pecan wood slices. Hubby was a fan of the hickory. Pass the bacon, please! I also ordered the raspberry latte which was quite tasty. On to the main course: Hubby ordered the Oink Omelet with potatoes and toast. The omelet was a great size and quite enjoyable, although I wasn't given a bite I can attest to his enjoyment of it. I ordered the biscuits and gravy because that is something I would never make at home. It was without a doubt the best I've ever had and a great size portion. I loved the freshness of the biscuits! No salt or pepper needed.The potatoes were wonderful as well. Neither of us was able to complete our meal! That usually doesn't happen at breakfast. The bill was over $45 so it was a definite splurge in every sense of the word, but for the portion size and quality of the food, I feel it was worth it. The biggest thing they could improve on is wait time and opening up the patio area to diners who might not mind sitting outside in our AZ heat.",

I ordered the Flight of bacon and Chicken California omelette with English muffin, hash brown potatoes and coffee. Our waitress was friendly and service was very fast. The omelette was very good. The Flight of bacon was 8 strips of all their flavors of bacon. I thought 5 out of the 8 strips of bacon tasted the same. The jalapeno, pepper and pecanwood bacon were distinguishable and tasty. The rest were just bacon flavored to me. It was all good, will have to come back again to sample more of the menu.       Came back a second time for lunch. This time it was about 1:15, they close at 2. The place was half full. I ordered the 50/50 burger with cheese and sweet potato fries. It took little longer for our food this time. The burger and fries were very good.The burger was flavorful and the sweet potato fries were salted just right and crispy. Decent service",

It sounds like my experience was different from some of the other reviewers, but Oink Cafe did not disappoint! I got the breakfast sandwich on a biscuit with cheese and hash browns for $6.49 and a side of mac n cheese for $3.99. My husband got the breakfast nachos, which was one of the specials of the day. The portions were huge! I ate half my sandwich, all of the mac n cheese, and maybe 1/3 of the hash browns and took the rest to go. I don't even think my husband ate half of his nachos, and he can eat. We got our food in less than ten minutes. I felt that my biscuit could've been more buttery and flaky, but everything else was great. The eggs were nice and fluffy, the bacon was awesome, and the hash browns were perfectly seasoned. Full disclosure: I had originally ordered the mac n cheese for my daughter but she was too busy drawing on the table so I ended up eating all of it. It was so good! The cheese was creamy and the pasta was al dente to withstand the weight of the cheese. I didn't have any of the breakfast nachos but for the rest of the day, my husband kept talking about how yummy the carnitas that was sprinkled over it was. He was also pleasantly surprised to find that the chips rested on a bed of hash browns.   I found Oink Cafe to be extremely reasonably priced and delicious. I'm so glad I got to check it out!",

Especially the elderly woman who was presumably supervising was rude,  and although Sundays are understandably busy, I don't think she should let her frustrations translate through to her guests.  We were quoted us the wrong wait time of 25 min after 39min when we asked were advised of would be another 35 min in a very abrasive manner.  We left and we won't find out if the food was worth the wait because of the rudeness of the host staff.  When spending $ service is almost as important as the food",

    "text": "Kitschy name, cute concept, a little indie place in an area consumed by monolithic chains -- Oink really had all the potential in the world.   The space is simple, open, and clean, although very sparse --  what some may interpret as modern simply reeked of half-assedness to me. \"Hey, let's throw some pink paint on one wall and call it a day!\" The bathrooms had fancy schmancy modern sinks and fixtures, although the weekly cleaning form on the back of the door was, disconcertingly, completely blank.  The service was super average, better than I expected considering I had heard it was atrocious. My breakfast-loving SO and I did our usual, each of us getting our own separate egg things followed by a shared short stack of blueberry pancakes. My omelet was nice, steaming hot and full of nice fresh veggies. The home fries on the side, though, were cold. The English muffin was barely toasted, also cold, and so slathered in butter it was slippery. My SO inhaled most of his Hollandaise-slathered Benedict, but let's face it, he'd slurp down a dog turd if it was drenched in Hollandaise. The pancakes were completely and utterly unremarkable, as was the OJ (watery and bitter) and coffee.   The sucker punch was the bill: with tip, over $40 for two for breakfast. If I wanted to shell out $40 for breakfast, I would stay in my own hood and go to Taylor's where I know the food will be spectacular and the service top-notch. Alternatively, I could go to IHOP across the street, where I know the food will be reliably above average for half the price.  Sorry, Oink, your prices make you little piggies. You've gotta step up your game, because no one wants to pay Paradise Valley prices for a Glendale experience.",

It took 50 min for the food to come out and when it did everything was cold. The sparse sausage gravy  was lumpy and bland, and the biscuits were dry.   On the chorizo and eggs, my dining companion said they were 'okay' mind you that the waitress had said that the reason for the wait on the food was because they were making \"fresh Chorizo'' we wondered if they meant they were mid slaughter being as it took so long to arrive. But then it was just OKAY? yeah, not good enough.   When the food came out the waitress dropped the side of turkey sausage, which ended up being a blessing because, though it took 10 more minutes to get a new order, at least it was hot.

Our waitress, Tammy, was extremely quick and friendly. And other waitstaff would buzz by with the coffee carafe for refills.  My husband's pancakes were undercooked in the center and had to be refired. I had the eggs Benedict. The sauce is extremely thick and a bit salty and the eggs were over poached and looked like hard little balls smothered in sauce. My applewood smocked bacon I ordered on the side was so hard it was difficult to eat.  But it's really the little details, like the not completely full chai tea and the discovery of dirty silverware rolled up in my napkin that leaves me with an ugh feeling.  Don't get me wrong, I was immediately brought new silverware, but the lack of attention to catch that before rolling it up in a napkin makes me wonder what else gets over looked.  I'll give it another try before completely washing my hands over it, but it is going to have to work a little harder to change my mind completely.",

The only irksome quality was our server, who seemed very nervous, checked on us at weird times, and said \"you're welcome\" too often (I didn't know that was possible, but it was).   I enjoyed the jalapeno (!) bacon and the oink french toast. The cinnamon rolls were also tasty, but my group was disappointed by the eggs benedict.

Even with dozens of people waiting, they have no sense of urgency about getting people seated.  On our LAST (read: FINAL) visit, we asked to be seated outside. The hostess started to seat us at a table with splats of bird poop on the table. I told her no thank you, I did not wish to be seated at a table with bird doo on it. No apology. Just, \"So you want to go inside then?\"  We did. I asked to speak with the manager. He was just full of excuses.  \"They get busy\" is what we were told. BY THE MANAGER!  ???????? That's disgusting. I understand the birds are not trained. I understand it is outside. But to actually be willing to SEAT someone at a TABLE covered in bird poop makes me wonder what the kitchen is like.  Does the kitchen staff get too busy to wash their hands? Too busy to clean the pans?  Too busy to remember not to put the cooked bacon where the raw bacon has been? No thank you.",

    "text": "OMG- I LOVE Oink. And I hate breakfast restaurants. So I guess that says a lot.   Tried it out on a whim one day and now I crave it- they have the BEST french toast. My husband rotates between pigs in a blanket and bacon pancakes. I initially was skeptical, especially after reading reviews. But, it's right across the street from an IHOP so I figured that they probably had something unique going on if they have been able to keep their lights on.   Once we decided to go in there and give Oink a try, I knew that we'd make a good choice. The pastry case with the bacon-maple donuts caught my attention, and It kept getting better- we received excellent service and ate excellent food. I'm really not sure why there aren't more 5 star reviews. One of these days, I'm going to have to be bad and get one of those donuts. Their pastry case seriously looks amazing, if you're trying to become a diabetic at breakfast.   We travel with a 1-year-old, so eating out is hard. Oink is the perfect place for us to go grab breakfast because it's noisy (read, always full), so I don't worry about my loud and messy baby, and it's fast (we have never been there more than 45 minutes from beginning to end.) It's always busy when we're there, but not too busy- longest wait I've had has been 5 minutes. We've gone there a handful of times since the first, and have never had the bad service people talk about, but maybe that's because we go early, closer to 8 (and we miss the after church crowd.) If you go in the winter months, be sure to sit on the patio- not much to look at (in the Target parking lot) but much more quiet.",

Latte was yummy!  They showed me a menu and it all escalated so quickly ... suddenly I found myself in front of eggs, home fries, and two strips of the monthly special, Pecanwood Glazed Bacon.  I would put a baby in that bacon. I'd make an honest woman out of that bacon. You get the idea.   Order your home fries extra hot as tiny potatoes don't insulate themselves very well.

When I go to a place for breakfast one of the key factors to a good experience is if the wait staff can keep my coffee cup filled. Yeah for Autumn, our server. She did this for our whole table. I honestly could not decide on what to get so I told her to \"Surprise me\". Sometimes not a good idea, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was served the breakfast burger. Big hunk of meat and cheese with pepper bacon on a wheat bun. I was impressed at it's size however they forgot the egg on the burger and brought it on a separate plate a minute later. One of our party tried the \"flight\" of bacon and stated it was pretty good. I tried a piece of the Applewood and I liked it better than the pepper.   So my overall impression of Oink Cafe was good but not over the top. Forgetting an ingredient on a menu item is a no-no in any restaurant but I am glad they brought it. I would have never known. The coffee was good and the servers excellent. A little on the pricey side for breakfast for my taste. Over $80 for 5 of us. I'd like to go back and try lunch. Maybe I will do that soon.",

We waited for almost ten minutes to be seated while the hostess was wrapping silverware instead of seating customers. When we were finally seated, they took our drink order and we waited for at least 10 minutes before we were allowed to order. We asked someone who walked by if she would take our order and she said \"Your waitress will be over soon.\" So we waited...and waited...  At last, we were able to place our order. We ordered a chicken wrap, a pulled pork sandwich, chicken fried steak, and the California Mac and cheese. With the chicken fried steak, I order Mac and cheese on the side. Which I was assured would be the best Mac and cheese I'd ever eaten...needless to say, it wasn't (but I'll get to that later). Thus began the long process of waiting for our food.   We waited for (no exaggeration) 45 minutes for our food to come. During that 45 minutes our water and tea was only refilled once--when we told the waitress we were ready to walk out. After she assured us it would be 5 more minutes for food, we decided to give it a chance--we were invested at this point.  Then our food came... Firstly, the wrap had onion (which was not something we were told it came with) and the chicken was very cold. Second, the chicken fried steak came with a biscuit--according to the menu--but we had to ask for it to get it. Thirdly, the Mac and cheese I promised I'd tell you about: it was dry, cold, and tasted like it'd been under a heating lamp while the rest of the food was being made.  Let's just say, we will not return!",

    "text": "Their French Toast is Awesome , their bloody marry is Awesome, the California omelette is Great the homefries are actually a bit crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside which is in my opinion perfect. BUT ..... their ham steak is more like a ham strip and the staff could be more informed of the menu and what the ingredients are in each plate and maybe pay more attention when taking the order in the first place. Most of the girls are attentive to other table besides their own which was good in our case or we would've sat with half our meal eaten and empty glasses.  All in all I would love to come back if we happen to be in the are again, but without pork chops on the menu and the ham steak being so thin we may decide on another place for lunch. Thanks to the floor manager for being so attentive when her server wasn't.  I am giving 5 stars because one server and a long wait time shouldn't shame a business that has such an AWESOME COOK , and Staff that does care.",

    "text": "It's all about the bacon at The Oink Cafe. You have to try the bacon flight on your first visit, a serving of eight distinctively flavored slices of bacon. It's really the only way to know which bacon you like best. You can then select your favorite with any future breakfast entree. The flight is also fun to share with friends. The only downside is that it essentially adds the cost of another breakfast to your tab.   Oink is very kid friendly, with a \"Little Piggies\" menu for them to color while you wait. The restaurant actually has a notebook full of completed \"Piggie\" masterpieces for you to browse through if you like. Or to which your little master can make an addition to it. There's also a small outdoor patio which is dog friendly.   The rest of the menu, outside of bacon, is solid enough. They have a diverse, yet pretty typical, assortment of breakfast offerings. Also burgers and sandwiches for lunch. The star, however, what makes Oink unique, is the bacon.  I understand this is one of just two locations, with the other being in Tucson.",

For a place that markets itself as a premier bacon spot, the bacon is average-at-best. While the bacon flavors offered were good, it was very thin and overcooked to a crisp. I'm okay with crispy bacon but not when you take a bite and it crumbles into small pieces. The hash browns I received were not only cold, they were over cooked with black burn char all over them. Our waitress was super nice but was covering a large section and we had to flag her down in order to get her to come to our table. Great idea, poor execution and we won't be back.",

I got the biscuit breakfast sandwich with hash browns and the half flight of bacon with applewood smoked, apple cider, sugar, honey, and hickory. Given that this is a bacon place, you expect it to be a bit of a greasy spoon, but this was way over the top. The hashbrowns were dripping in grease and were a little flat. My biscuit was tasteless unless you count baking powder as a flavour, Pillsbury from a can would be a better option. The bacon was good but inconsistent in how it was cooked - some pieces were overdone and some were under and fatty. I liked all the different flavours but honey and applewood smoked were my favourites. I liked the pig serving plate and that we were given a guide to which pieces were which flavour. The coffee was good, which was a nice surprise, and service was very fast and friendly. Overall, a fun place to try but I couldn't make it my go-to without a bit of improvement from the kitchen.",

When it's busy, forget it... break out the dice, because it's hit and miss when it comes to quality. Neat niche though.",

    "text": "This place is a decent breakfast joint, but the only thing that really makes it stand out are the bacon flights, as the rest of the menu covers the basics you can find just about anywhere else. With that said the apple cider bacon is soooooo so good!  My visit was a combination of decent food and spotty service which amounted to quite the average meal. My dad and I came in for lunch during the week and waited a few minutes to be seated, which is no big deal. However once we were seated we waited, and waited, and waited until my dad finally got a servers attention and asked if we could place our order. I think there was some confusion around who was supposed to take our table, but the waitress helped us. She was nice but definitely a little busy with all of her tables. We asked for two waters, and only got one, then asked for the second and still had to flag someone else down to finally get it. After our food arrived it took awhile to get our bill too. Again, it just seemed like maybe a lack of clear coordination among the entire floor as our waitress was nice herself.   For the food, I got the California omelette with a side of fruit and toast and my dad got a bacon flight and eggs. The omelette was a good size and filling, but there wasn't really anything that stood out about my meal. The bacon flight was of course cool and my dad enjoyed the selection but that was about the only highlight of the meal.   Again, you can get a filling breakfast and try out some different kinds of bacon, but unfortunately overall nothing about this place is really calling me back.",

I love that they had so much variety with the bacon. Doing 1/2 a flight, I tasted 4 different kinds of bacon with my favorite being the jalapeno bacon. The waiters/waitresses had great attitudes and helped me pick the items off the menu.   The food was amazing as well. The eggs benedict had the perfect poached egg on top with a side of hash browns/potatoes. The waffle was very fluffy and a good amount of sweet. The strawberries on top were very fresh as well. 10/10 would come back",

Because of this, we had to be seated outside, which I usually am not a fan of this time of year, but the area was nicely shaded and it was around 10:30am when we stopped by. $12 for a below par burger that left me disappointed is why I'm not likely to stop by again. It was edible, but a little dry and the bun they served it on was on the dry side too. The menu claimed that they were 1/2 pound but I highly doubt that; it was closer to 1/3 lb. I was hoping the french fries would save the day, but again they were lacking in flavor (and salt). Sorry to say, I had more fun feeding them to Ilean (the bird with one leg that hangs around the patio). My sister ordered the pulled pork sandwich and halfway through she tossed out the bottom bun as it was soaked in oil. We hadn't checked any reviews before stopping by because she had chosen; she said their breakfast menu is better, but based on today, I might just pass...",

M ordered the yogurt parfait, A ordered the breakfast sandwich, D ordered the french toast sandwich and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries and coleslaw.  While the others entrees were fine, mine was a major disappointment.  The pulled pork was clearly reheated to the point that it was charred AND extra dry.  In addition, the sweet potato fries were way overcooked.  It's a sad commentary when the coleslaw was the best thing on my plate.  This disappointment cost me $11.95 plus tax and tip.  If you are going to have your restaurant specialize in pork, you would think the pulled pork would be superlative.  I could not finish the plate.  While our server was first class, good service just doesn't overcome lousy, overcooked food.  It's unlikely we would return despite the fact our daughter lives within walking distance of the restaurant.",

    "text": "The Boy and I decided to try The Oink after another breakfast place was closed for the holiday and had a Meh experience.  The food was very good.  I enjoyed my Two Egg Plus combo, it was a large amount of food if you find yourself hungry.  I chose scrambled eggs and they were fluffy and buttery.  I chose a biscuit option instead of toast and it was HUGE.  If you are a biscuit and gravy fan, I would suggest going ala cart from the sides menu (one biscuit vs two) as one biscuit split in half would fill and entire plate.    The boy had Huevos Rancheros and was very happy.  He especially liked the ranchero sauce, I had a taste and likened it more to a mole, super dark yet sweet with a hint of heat.  I also tried their classic bloody mary which had more heat than spice.    Where our experience was lacking was the service.  Our server did not check on us once after we got our food and we had to flag her down to get to go box after she dropped the check and left while I was asking for a box.  My two egg plus combo came with choice of bacon but my server didn't ask what kind I wanted and I forgot it was an option. Seems like this would be front and center for a server since the 8 kinds of bacon are listed all over the menu and walls.  We also weren't given straws for our drinks (including the bloody mary) while all other tables had them in all their drinks. Our drinks were never refilled and one attempt was made to refill my coffee five minutes after I got it.   The hostess and busser staff needs some training.  During our 20 min wait at any given time, there were 4 or 5 tables empty waiting to be seated or waiting to be cleared.  There was a wait-list of 8 parties waiting to be seated during that time with open tables so revenue was being missed with that many open tables.  I also saw hostesses walk by tables full of dirty dishes and not touch a single dish.   I do want to give props to the patrons.  A gentleman was going to eat breakfast alone and was waiting for a table when a table of two asked if he wanted to join them instead of waiting and dining alone.  Awesome.",

Hungry and tired we decided to stop my Oink.... they bragged about having 8 different types of bacon.   So let's see....  As we walked in  there was a cute waitress who made  sure to tell us there is a 20 mins wait....  not bad on a brunch Sunday!   We finally got seated and I grabbed the menu.  Let's see... I need a cup of coffee first....  now let's order.    I decided to get the classic home fries, eggs and their famous peppered bacon. Of course I ordered the butter milk biscuit.  The price was great.... that plate was $7.99. Perfect price if you have a large family.   I turned to see the waitress heading towards me with a tray full of goodness. As she placed the plate in front of me. I was completely DISAPPOINTED the bacon was so thin and  wilted.  I imagined thick slices of pepper dipped bacon....   SORRY.... I received the saddest looking bacon in all of bacon land. Let's not start on the home fries which were hard and burnt.   I moved all of my food around to make it look like I ate something.  I was so hungry I just had to eat it.  As tears were welling up in my eyes.  I began to eat the worse breakfast I have had in about a year.  Look advertising bacon should mean I'm in bacon heaven not BACON HELL....   I wouldn't return for there breakfast maybe their sandwiches are better but I don't think I would try that either.

We were told to seat ourselves and so once we did, it took some time to be greeted  by our server.   I ordered a hot hazelnut latte and hubby ordered an iced vanilla latte. The server dropped off two hot lattes and so I told him one was iced. The hazelnut latte was okay but the vanilla latte was pretty good. We decided to share the Paradise Valley omelet (spinach, mushrooms, bacon and cheddar cheese). The omelet came with hash browns and wheat toast. Then, we ordered 1/2 bacon flight: apple cider, applewood smoked, jalapeno and hickory.   Between the both of us, the omelet entree portion was generous and we couldn't even finish. The omelet was really good- big slices of mushrooms and lots of cheese! I think the whole bacon flight thing is a little overrated. The jalapeno bacon and applewood smoked was good, but $4.99 for four slices and they weren't even crunchy?! Maybe they should add the bacon to an entree or something instead and then you choose which ones you want.   Our server was pretty slow in getting us our check and checking us out, but our bill was inexpensive and we really enjoyed our meal and lattes.",

I think there's an ihop across the street that could do a much better job than these folks",

Our party of  6 was seated almost immediately. We had two young kids so it was great that we were.  Our server was helpful despite the rush and our food arrived   quickly.   Now the menu lived up to its namesake. Bacon was omnipresent! Bacon scones, bacon pancakes, a bacon sampler to name a few. The bacon items were great yet outside of them the rest of the food was rather ordinary, typical breakfast fare.  It was good yet nothing different if it wasn't bacon centered.  All in all good time and would come back to enjoy the bacon goodies. Maybe the rest of the menu will catch up with its star.",

For twenty minutes I repeatedly tried to flag down our waitress. To sum it up I finally got my donut when I asked for it as she brought the check.  So my bacon on the meal was barely cooked and the toast was burnt, no butter on the toast at all. I won't be returning to this place. If you have a chance,  pass.

    "text": "Based on the name and outside advertisements, you'd assume that this was some sort of pork style specialty house. Once inside you'd assume that it would smell like pork. You'd assume there would be pictures of swine everywhere. And you'd assume that not only will the menu be pork heavy, but that also the server would promote and encourage pork. So imagine my surprise when none of these things were True.  It wasn't a big deal though that it seems they were trying real hard to be a classy restaurant. But its an oink cafe. That means pig coffee to me. I want Bacon and an espresso. It should smell like Bacon and coffee. Or Bacon or coffee. It was more of a chemical smell.   The layout was odd too. There were apparently two entrances. What I thought was the front which is located street side might have been the back because when you walk in, its a weird long hallway type room filled with tables. (BTW it was packed) The other side had what looked like a main counter with a menu but we never got that far because this was a be seated by server place.  Decorations were odd too. There were SOME artsy pictures of swine. But mostly random pictures of art. I love art but it didn't fit.   Our server must have been a rookie. Not very attentive. She kind of just threw the crayons in front of my daughter. She didn't explain the menu at all. It took her forever to bring our drinks. And I even tried to break the ice by asking the standard \"what would you get?\" question. Her response, \"I'm not really sure. I think everything's good.\"  Ok when I hear that I get annoyed. Humuor me at least. Also know you product and services. And if your going to promote a \"classy\" resturant, then don't wear short shorts. Nothing made sense. On to the menu:  Basically the menu is basic items like sanwhiches and salads that have one or two Bacon strips. Ok. Well I got the salad. And to my surprise it was pretty good.  It was a fresh spinach salad with an assortment of seeds and fruit and Bacon bits. Also they had a custom dressing called Bacon dressing. Now it tasted nothing like Bacon. It was more of a sweet vinagerette of sort. It was good. The salad though was amazing. it wasn't over filled with everything. It was mostly spinach. And again very fresh.   Salad was good enough to give a three star. Also it wasn't a bad experience, just dissapointing. And the only reason I factor in the poor server is because the owner himself was walking around greeting people and when he got to us, he wasn't really engaged or genuine. So perhaps a lack of customer service training could be the reason for our poor service.   If your in the area and you want a salad for lunch, I'd recommend them.",

As a goof, I showed our server my bacon armband tattoo and she immediately brought the owner over to see it. She took a picture of it and our group, then ordered a flight of bacon for us, on the house. I especially like the jalapeno bacon. But, let's face it.

You can get your coffee or other drink while you wait but I highly recommend getting a maple bacon covered donut or donut bite. Makes any amount of waiting seem worth it!!

I have not had anything here that I have not liked, I do want to try more items but always crave the French toast when I walk in, the sweet potato fries are also great - sometimes I get a side with my French Toast.  They are only open for breakfast and lunch which is a downside for me as I would have no problem going more than once in a day.  The hostess on the weekend, a young girl is pretty slow but the food is beyond worth it.  I have recommended this place to everyone I know.",

    "text": "I seriously love this place.  The only thing that stinks is the french dip is off the menu.  But today I ordered a bbq sandwich.  BBQ sandwiches are tricky, you seriously have to get every bit right, juicy but not so much that my bread is like mush, pork with a strong enough flavor I can taste it through the sauce, and bread I can chew!  Well, they nailed it.  They also put the cole slaw on the side for me since I'm weirded out by cole slaw on a sandwich.  Oh, and I have mentioned the sweet potato fries....oh ya! They don't salt them so you will have to do so but that's ok because I can go either way with these tasty morsels :)  Did I say that I got all this while walking in 10 minutes before they closed and they were so sweet to me and didn't complain, at least while I was in earshot....thanks guys!",

    "text": "My Fiancee and I love trying new local places for breakfast/brunch every weekend, it's become some what of a ritual for us and something I look forward to during the week. We love supporting local businesses so we were excited to give Oink a shot.  When we arrived at Oink, the Hostess seemed to be a bit flustered and didn't initially greet us and check us in... This was not a bad sign to me, just a new business still trying to work out the qinks.  Once we were seated, the menu looked great. I decided to go for my breakfast favorite, Eggs Benedict (listed as a 'specialty item' on their menu). My Fiancee ordered the French toast and we also ordered a side of bisquits & gravy and sausage. What a DISPAPPOINTMENT! You would think with a name like 'Oink' you would be getting the best breakfast meats one could imagine, this was not the case. The ham on my Eggs Benedict was as thin as a piece of pepporoni (no joke!), our side of breakfast links looked like they were microwaved and tasted like it too. The Eggs Benedict was by far the most disgusting dish I think I have ever ordered, when it first came out, the eggs were clearly over done- more like hard boiled then poached.  However, what made the dish disgusting was the 'hollandaise sauce', it was not hollandaise sauce. It was the color of milk and had the constinancy of half and half and there was so much on my plate that it became Eggs Benedict cereal, literally. The english muffins were soaking in this thin liquid that gave off the smell of yogurt, eww. Even though it looked appalling, I decided to try it. Just to give you an idea, I had to plug my nose in order to chew and swallow it! It was AWFUL. My Fiancee's french toast was good and so was the coffee but thats it. The bisquits and gravy weren't anything special and I was only happy we ordered it because of how completely inedible the Eggs Benedict were. Long story short, if Oink plans on succeeding, they need Gordon Ramsey to come in and help them out. Sorry Oink, I really did want to love you :(  I will NOT be visiting again.",

Service was terrible, we had to ask for coffee several times, the coffee had no taste. One person ordered a waffle and when it was served it was so cold the butter wouldn't even melt, we had to send it back. The food took a long time to be served. The waitress was polite but looked unkept about her appearance.  I don't think a person waiting on you should be wearing a sweatshirt.  What happened to looking good at your job no matter what it is.  It would be nice having a person serving your food to look presentable. All five of us decided we will not be returning to this restaurant.",

The people aren't mean to the customers but it's insane how chaotic it is at such a small establishment.  The old lady is weird and creepy.   There is a strange hostess table in the center of the restaurant that none of the signs tell you to go to.   I see a bunch of staff talking to each other and arguing. They all look so confused its sad.   I wish the restaurant impossible guy would come here and tell these people how to run a restaurant.   Again the food was tasty but the basic functionality customers expect restaurants to have is not there.   I hope they get help because it would be nice to see this place survive.",

Apparenlty, it was an hour past the point I noticed.  They let us hang out, even gave us a free brownie and chocolate chip cookie which was to live for!.  The owners are very nice.  I ordered half a club sandwich and tortilla soup with sweet potato fries.  The sandwich much bigger than my bite could handle but delish! My boyfriend had a huge breakfast burrito.  The portions are massive!!!! The only thing is that we were expecting more pork options..at least pork chop or pulled pork items on the menu. But, it is definitely a place we will go back to.",

Honestly, I think the problem was it was late in the day, nearly closing time, and it appeared that everything had been under warmers for a while. I'm not going to completely condemn the place until I go back early in the morning and see if I can get a fresh meal. I think the place has potential but my first outing was not so great.  My son had a burger (I don't remember which one) and he was pretty happy with that.  Oh, and as several have mentioned already, service was slow as molasses.

They serve alcohol, which is nice for someone that wants a Bloody with their breakfast.   Food was hot and well done. The hash browns were crispy on the outside. After asking for \"crispy\" bacon, it was nice to actually receive crispy bacon. Too many places haven't figured out how to do that yet. Our Iced Teas were refilled without having to ask.   Even though places like Chompies have a lot to choose from and the food is good, I really enjoy smaller neighborhood or Mom and Pop places like Oink.

The service was decent, it was moderately busy, but the waitresses seemed overworked and not very enthusiastic.  But the bacon is what I had a problem with most!!  The signs all around the business talk about bacon and how they have 8 different flavors to try.  So, I ordered a full flight of bacon, one piece of all 8 flavors.  To say it was impressive would be a lie.  Most of the flavors tasted very similar, while a couple of them had no taste at all.  I did like the flavors of the Jalapeno and Apple Cider bacon, but the rest were rather \"run of the mill\".  The biggest turn-off was the size of the bacon, it was so small and not worth the value!  For an 8-piece plate, it costs $8.99!  That's over $1 a slice and they were so small!  I was expecting some thick cuts of bacon, something that would be a mouthful and give you a full sense of their quality food, but it was rather the opposite.  I don't think I will be going back there again.  For the same price, I could have ordered an entire meal, instead what I got was a medium-sized snack.",

Unfortunately, that is the only thing I can rave about. We ordered the bacon flight. At a placed called Oink, you would think the bacon would be exceptional; not so. It was over-cooked and thin :-(. My omelette was nothing special. It wasn't terrible, just something you can get at any breakfast chain. With a name like Oink, I thought I was going to have an exceptional breakfast experience. It was just mediocre at best and the service was not good at all. Definitely not worth going if you have to go out of your way to get there.",

I really don't need to hear about your personal and work problems as I eat.  Serving 101 tells you not to complain and gossip anywhere near ear shot of the guest.  It would be really easy for me to give this place 4 stars if it was more consistent. Undercooked eggs one time, perfect eggs the next etc",

    "text": "The concept is promising, the execution is disappointing. The interior lacks character. The placard on the table looked like someone just dashed it off on their inkjet printer and I can't recall for sure at this moment, but I'm pretty sure there were misspellings. It's as if they didn't have the funds to decorate or add all the little touches that identify the restaurant in the diner's mind. Overall it could use a graphic designer to do the menus and table cards. A visit with an imaginative friend to some store like Z Gallerie or Marshalls Home Store where you can get ready-made framed posters,  canvas prints and such could remedy the bland walls. This is a nice area, between Phoenix, Scottsdale and Paradise Valley. People expect a restaurant to have an identity. Your food has to be crazy good for people to want to return to a place which has all the character of a school cafeteria.  OK so who cares about my aesthetic sense; what about the food, right? Well I've only been there once (a 2nd trip planned shortly). My bacon flight was disappointing; a couple of the slices were overcooked and had the consistency of beef jerky. My dining partner's eggs benedict were well-done. That's bad. I talked to another friend who went here and they said the same thing happened to their eggs benedict. The service was OK. I'll give it another try but I doubt this is a place I'll want to make a regular stop. I think I gave it one star too many because  I just wanted so bad for it to be good.  UPDATE:  went here recently for a 2nd time. Better experience but I'm not changing the 3-star rating. The burgers were very good. The website menu and the physical menu show a discrepancy in the size of the Oink burger patty. The site says 1/3 lb (while all others are 1/2 lb), the menu says 1/2 lb. Pretty sure the actual burger was 1/2 lb. Waitress was a little slow refreshing the teas but she did do it and they were both very good. I hate it when I get stale icky iced tea at a restaurant. It is very inexpensive to keep fresh tea around. It's just water and a tea bag.  Unsolicited advice to the owner:  1) the concept needs better execution so that your restaurant's concept is 'sticky' in the mind of the diner. They remember it and go back.  a) the menus do not really sell the concept and are printed on plain old office paper on an inkjet printer. Hire or finagle a graphic designer to design new menus that better reflect the theme of the restaurant. If you don't want to go for professional-looking laminated menus, at least go to Kelly Paper and get a ream of heavy card stock to print them on so they don't look so cheap.  b) the walls need help.  2) The table card also needs a graphic designer's touch. What's more, I would not have assumed that a breakfast place - yes I know they serve lunch too but in my mind and most people's, it's a breakfast place - would serve booze yet that is what is on the card, the adult drinks. They have beer and wine and hard drinks too. Some people would like a Bloody Mary with breakfast, I bet they'd order one if you let them know it's available.  3) Speaking of Bloody Marys, did you know that there is bacon-flavored vodka? Why are you not pushing Oink Bloody Mary's or something like that? Missing the boat here.  4) If I were designing your menus, I would have on every page in big bold type: \"SAUSAGE SIZE IT! ADD BACON OR SAUSAGE TO ANY ITEM FOR $1/SLICE\" or something like that.  5) My friend raved about the bacon maple frosted donut. I did not see it anywhere on the menu. I had to ask the waitress and she said, \"oh it's there under 'donuts' on the back page'. All it said was , 'donuts' or whatever. THIS THING WAS ON THE COVER OF NEW TIMES!!! Why aren't you pimping the sht out of it? You might even have some other awesome donuts but you're not trying very hard to sell it to me.",

Our server Heather was nice, she was very patient as we had a mix up with the coupon and she helped us.  We liked the idea of flavored bacon, we tried the jalapeno and it was very tasty, however, they didn't pass the crispy bacon test... we always make sure to say 'very crispy'...  I ordered 'huevos rancheros' and didn't like them much... they had some sort of red enchilada sauce, which it would have been OK, but it was kind of sweet and I didn't like it.  Hubby ordered an omelette with chorizo an it was ok, it had the red sauce too.  Beans and potatoes were very good, I ended up making my own breakfast burrito at home with them : )  Oh, if you access through the Cactus entrance, make sure to go to the other door as the hostess is there... they do have a sign by the door but  I missed it...",

    "text": "BACON! I thought the \"bacon flight\" was the greatest dish ever.  Eight pieces of perfectly cooked bacon, one each of: applewood smoked, sugar cured, honey cured, peppered, cherrywood, apple cider, hickory and jalapeno.  The bacon comes on a plate of lettuce, which as a bonus turns into a mini-salad with bacon flavored dressing, after you eat the bacon (at least it does, if you are a pig like me and my sister, no pun intended).  They also have a half-flight (four pieces of bacon, in flavors of your choice), but the full flight is so much better, IMO, especially the first time eating there.  EGGS! Besides the bacon flights, I'm also still in amazement over my scrambled egg. I really don't like eggs that much, so for me to LOVE a scrambled egg is just odd, and to crave a scrambled egg the way I crave a pumpkin frappe or a filet mignon is beyond bizarre.  However, that's how good the egg was.  I cannot stop thinking about it.  Yes - one silly little egg!!!  I suppose that my lack of egg expertise should be taken into consideration, as it is not my usual area of foodie-ness.  However, I may be a convert now after my encounter with the world's most perfect scrambled egg at Oink.  My mom ordered the yogurt parfait with granola and fruit.  I did not try it, but it was full of really big fruit, that was fresh, not runny, and the most amazing granola I have ever seen.  When I see giant, whole almonds crowning a tower of fluffy yogurt - I get a little happy.  Too many places give you watery yogurt, with powdery granola and mushy fruit.  But my mom ate the whole thing, so I am assuming it tasted as good as it looked.  SERVICE - so mostly good points and a possible negative point.  Our waitress was awesome - she even let me know that the bacon flavored coffee is more of a novelty, which most people try but don't usually ask for refills.  That was nice, since I wasn't in the mood for a novelty.  I ordered an almond latte instead (which was really good), and am going to try the bacon flavored coffee next time.  She also double checked that I said almond and not hazelnut, which I appreciated.  A lot of times people forget and just hope it turns out okay, rather than checking.    The only reason I mention a possible negative point, is because it is more of a relaxed environment, so if you are in a hurry or one of those moody people that expects a certain type of \"dining experience\" - make sure you sit at the counter I'm guessing.  It's definitely not a matter of \"bad\" service or \"slow\" service, or \"inattentive\" staff.....it is just a relaxed, happy, good mood sort of place.  Maybe I've been living in Boston for too long, if I am even making a note of this?  I cannot wait to go back this week, and try more of the menu.  Definitely a five star place.",

    "text": "One of my favorite breakfast spots in Phoenix!  Bacon and sausage are just below filet mignon on my list of favorites.  Oink has several different sausage varieties, a few different types of bacon and everything else is delicious too!  I have had the pigs in a blanket, omelets, French toast... they were all excellent.  This is one of the spots we take guests when they visit.  You wont leave hungry and it's got some character which really sets it apart from your average corporate chain restaurant!",

The food is amazing and I can't even talk about the bacon without my mouth watering! Anne the manager is so nice and always takes care of the customers! We had stepped away from the restaurant to go to the book store while we waited to get sat and when we came back they had already called our name. So when I asked them, they said they would seat us at the next avaliable table. I didn't expect them to do this for us but no more than that minutes later we were being sat! My boyfriend ordered the Oink omelet and I had the egg breakfast. It was so good! Can't rave more about this place and the staff! Such a great atmosphere!",

Homemade pancake batter daily and it does taste like mammas kitchen. The bacon comes in flavors, I choose the honey and to be honest tasted like regular bacon- but the bacon was delish regardless. Nothing fancy, in fact the place is simple but offers a wide variety of choices. Must try- sit in a shopping area that has a target and Dollar tree so I was able to walk my food off!",

Breakfast was good; I stole a piece of the pepper bacon and I'm so glad I did!!  Yummy!!  The chimi was pretty good...it was very heavy and VERY big!  I definitely had plenty to take home.  I also saw the Bloody Mary flight pass by and made it a must-try for my next visit.  Also, loved the uniqueness of the handwritten specials on the wall and the kids-colored pigs on the other wall!!

The pork inside was very good (slow cooked in bacon grease - c'mon man!) and the chorizo sauce on top added a lot of flavor. My wife had the Oink French toast and also could only eat half. The raspberry and blueberry sauce was a perfect topping.   One minor thing:  We ordered half a 'flight' (lol) and picked the applewood, pepper and sugar bacon. The bacon was very good but...Both my wife and I could barely tell a difference between the flavors. Thought there would be a noticeable difference especially when you have sugar and pepper.   Service was friendly, fast and consistent. Ambience was casual and clean.   Would definitely come back!",

Before that our server [Taylor] made an inappropriate comment that made me want to get up and leave right away [being mean to people and making \"funny\" comments that hurt people's feelings is not my idea of FUNNY]; but since it was Saturday AM and we were seated front and center I didn't want to make a scene- which I now [honestly] regret. The food we ordered was brought out by another server. I took a bite and the sweet potato fries were cold. I checked the rest of the fries and they were cold too. Taylor popped up and was informed that the food was cold and that we dont have the time to wait for fresh ones. I didn't expect her to comp the meal but she could have comped the cold fries. Taylor was the worst server I ever had. Part of me wanted to run off without paying for this horrible meal. I am never coming here again. I've been to The Oink before and even if some things were not perfect the servers were always sweet and tried to make up for it. A lady approached as I was placing money on the table and asked if I needed a box for the rest of the food- being on the verge of tears and quite frankly wanting to give Miss Taylor a piece of my mind I was short and said \"we are leaving thank you\". I hope Taylor reads this. How you treat people matters. Don't be a snooty snob. #45centTip #shouldHaveLeft0 #theNOink #prettyButMean #rudePeopleStink #getSomeMannersGirl #done",

If I hadn't notice the sign that said it closes at 2 pm, I wouldn't have known that this place could be cleared out in an hour!! Anyways, decided to see how long the wait would be and was seated immediately.   The waitress came over shortly after being seated and took our order. The wait between ordering and our food coming out was close to 20 minutes! I guess not too bad, but we noticed that people that came in after us were getting their orders much sooner then us. Maybe it was because of my order. Anyways, food finally came out and was much larger in size then I had expected. Babe didn't enjoy her food, even though it was just a turkey sandwich. She said it was very plain and had no flavor to it. I on the other hand ordered the Ranchero Chimichanga which was delicious. It was VERY filling tho and felt like I overate when I was done. I didn't even get around to eating my side of fries (came with the order).   This place is very popular and tables were always filling up as soon as someone left. Good thing the tables were cleaned immediately and floors swept as soon as someone left. Our waitress seemed to have half the tables, so she didn't come around to us but one time. Was very friendly though.   May try this place out again if in the area and hungry.",

Bloody Mary was decent and you can have it with bacon as well. Didn't really like pork Benedict as much but it was executed well, just not my thing I suppose. When it comes to service it was pretty awful: on top of crazy long line we didn't get our water for solid 15 minutes. Our server forgot silverware and disappeared, to bring us our check took her forever also. None of that she was remotesorry about either and acted super indifferent. Place wasn't even that packed.

I mean, like lets be real, a little breakfast sandwich for more than $10 is not what I was looking to spend given the quality/amount.   I do believe that a return to this location will not be necessary because I can't consciously spend that amount of money on a few morsels of food. It's just not an economically sound place to spend your money.   I really wanted to like this place, but their prices aren't equal to their product. Had they blown me away in quality or quantity, I would be ranting and raving about my excellent experience. It just didn't happen and I don't think they deserve another chance after luring me in.

My husband enjoyed the spicier ones but I can't eat those.  The applewood was great though!  My breakfast was average - nothing special.  Service was average.  Overall, an ok experience.  I might come here again but wouldn't go out of my way for it.  I will say they had some pastries in a case by the front door... I didn't have the appetite left to try them but man did they look delicious!  Maybe next time!",

Regardless of the time, they were quick to welcome us and get us seated. For it being almost closing time, they were still quite busy.  My husband and I both ordered the oink signature bloody mary. The flavor was very good and it came with olives and bacon. I decided on breakfast and went pretty simple with the eggs, hash browns, and jalapeno bacon. The bacon...oh the bacon...was absolutely delicious. The rest of the breakfast was good but the big standout here was the jalapeno bacon.  My husband got the chicken avocado sandwich and said it was amazing. It came with coleslaw which he also said was very good.   We will absolutely come back for the Bloody Mary, mimosa, and bacon flight!",

The service is usually really good, sometimes a little slow if they're really busy. But that's to be expected anywhere you go. After some recent disappointments with other breakfast places, finally a restaurant where everything is just right. Keep it up, I'll be back for more.",

The waitress never removed our plates after the meal and we didn't receive our salads prior to the meal.  If you go here you have to be prepared to let your expectations of good service go. We heard about this joint from the food network prior to going and it didn't meet our exceptions on both food quality and service.  Sometimes I can overlook some food quality issues if the service is good but this place has neither.",

    "text": "WARNING: My family and I never got to try the food.  I have never written a negative review and I am sad that a new place has to be my first.  So my husband has been waiting for this place to open for a month.  He booked opening weekend on the calendar and invited the whole family.  The four of us (toddler and teen as well) arrived about 10am.  There was no one to greet us and looked like they had a number (maybe 6) of families waiting.  After a few minutes a (teen?) girl came over and kind of took our name.  No information, no wait time, no menus (which we took to look over ourselves).  Noticed tables sitting empty but not cleared.  Another couple waiting next to us for 10 minutes ended up finally having their server come over and hand them their bill.  Interesting...  We waited for over a hour.  In that time no one saw a bus boy.  The two tables were never cleared of their slowly rotting food in that entire time (though the \"greeter\" girl came over to the same table twice, clearing 1-2 cups each time...).  A few groups were slowly seated as we waited, but we also noticed the outside tables were empty but no one was being asked to sit outside.  About 30 mins in, the greeter girl came over to see if anyone wanted to sit outside (should have been done from the start.).  As she looked for people, she rolled her eyes when she couldn't find the name from her list.  When we were finally seated (by the same greeter...), the table soaking wet.  She grabbed some paper towels and handed them to my son, who dried the table himself.  No silverware was on the table so a few minutes later, one of the owners/managers put some down.  He half-heartedly (and inappropriately if I may add) said \"Guess you waited awhile?\".  I said it looked like their were some logistics issues and he immediately shot back that \"No, we are very busy\".  Um, if you cannot handle your shop being busy, than yes - you have logistics issues.  My husband asked if there were any busboys and he said there were three and they were all working.  Wrong attitude all around - this is not how to endear your customer base.  After he walked off, my son noticed the silverware had dried egg on several pieces and that the 5-6 tables nearest to us had NO food on them - all the families were waiting without menus.  That was the last straw.  As the waitress came over for the first time to ask for our drink requests, I explained it was not needed as we were leaving.  It sounds like the food here could be excellent.  But they need someone with major restaurant management experience to get these things ironed out immediately.  Additionally, management needs to realize that their attitudes can make or break their business.  I love supporting local shops and I wish them the best.  However, I will wait for more yelp feedback to determine if we will ever return.  P.S.  In going over my review with my husband and son, he said he has a few friends that went over the weekend with their families as well.  One said they waited over 1.5 hrs only to get the wrong items delivered to their table, with no explanation of what happened or apology.  Very disappointing...",

They did not appear that busy and there were 3 servers on but everyone got crappy service as far as I could see. Maybe they have another dining room I don't know about that they all went to. When I complained about the jalapenos (she should have asked why I only ate half) she took it off the bill. The manager never came out, no one said anything when I got up to get more coffee.

Others have mentioned the noisey atmosphere, but I appreciate it since I have a little one that can be a bit on the noisey side herself and here she blends in.  I highly recommend stopping in on a week day for lunch if you are looking for it to be much quieter.  The manager is great. He is always working the room and stopping at tables to chat. The food is always great! If you are lucky enough to stop in when they have beer cheese soup it is a must to get. I have never had such delicious soup. A must try!",

It seems to be a locally owned small business and we find the best food and service in this type of establishment. To borrow from William S. Burroughs writing about the Rio Grande Valley; \"\"In the Valley, restaurants are not operated by people who are cookers and purveyors of food. They are opened by somebody who decides that \"people always eat\" so a restaurant is a \"good deal\".\"\"  The owners may have restaurant experience, but it's not apparent. The staff is young, and doesn't  seem to know how sit-down breakfast works. They probably grew up eating from the McDonalds drive-up window. We got coffee and placed our order, and never saw the waitress again until she was ready to give us the bill. Our coffee was gone long before the food came, someone in a black uniform (one of the owners?)  brought the food to us, but didn't see our coffee cups were empty. The waitress never came over to ask us if everything was OK. She did ask if we wanted the check when she saw our plates were empty. At that point she asked if we wanted more coffee. A quick fix would be to take the owners and waitstaff across the street to I-HOP for breakfast so they could see what they should be doing.",

I ordered a burger and sweet potato fries. Reasonable time passed and out came by burger no Denver omelet. They said it would be right out. My wife at some of my burger and I ate some too. The server came by said any minute now. Finally her Omelet arrived. My wife ask the server where are the bell peppers and onions on the potatoes? The server says, they are in the potatoes. My wife ask her to show her and the server picked through them and agreed, no bell peppers or onions. So, back to the kitchen. Why would one need to fight to get whats right? Meantime a man who i think was a floor MGR was cruising around not really doing anything. He finally came to our table after our bill arrived and ask how things were. My said below average and he said thank and come back again. NOT! My wife and agreed the next time any restaurant comes out of the kitchen with half the order, we are leaving. Its in-excusable.",

We tried 4 different kinds and they were all amazing. I had the eggs Benedict, and for the first time since I moved to Phoenix 15 years ago, actually got a properly poached egg. And the hollandaise tasted like it was made from scratch rather than some powder in a package. My husband ordered an omelet which he devoured, and seemed to thoroughly enjoy, I opted not to taste it since it was more spicy than I was in the mood for. We decided to top off our brunch with a maple bacon glazed doughnut which was still warm and made onsite, it was absolutely melt in your mouth delicious!  I will admit our over all meal was a little pricey, but I would eat there again in a heartbeat! Where else can you get  jalapeno bacon for breakfast?",

I bet it won't be there in 12 months - just like everything else that has tried the same location in the past 20 years. Went there for breakfast last Sunday 3/25/12. It was half full. Ordered a vegetable omelet and a pancake. How hard is that? After 30 minutes I asked where the food was. Without checking, the waitress told me it would still be a few minutes as there 'were a lot of tickets in the kitchen'. In a half full restaurant after 30 minutes of waiting? One omelet? It gets worse .. much worse.  The chef came out to apologize. Told me that their system somehow was not entering the tickets of our waitress but that he would personally make it immediately. He didn't check my order with me.. remember it was lost. Amazing how two tables behind us got food from the same waitress. Their tickets did not get 'lost'. I know garbage when I hear it. He should just have been honest.,  Then the omelet came out  10 minutes later sans pancake (40 mins now).  I ate the slice of toast which was not toast but warm bread .. I hate that. The omelet looked peculiar and seemed burned.  Then I took a bite of the omelet and out popped a pink piece of ham. I was livid. It is completely against my religion and they had served me ham. I think they took the first omelet off the grill. He had no idea what my order was and did not ask. I screamed at the manager but I don't think he got it. I should have made a lot bigger scene but my wife stopped me. Take my advice .. stay away. Everybody complains about the service for a good reason.  Oink stands for a pig of a restaurant.  Let's hope Yelp lets this review stand.",

We walked in on a Friday morning, around 10 am, and 90's rap was blaring through the empty restaurant. I mean LOUD. So, a little strange, but no big deal, we decided to sit outside. We looked at the menu and decided. I ordered the PV omelet and my husband chose the Belgian waffles. The food came out quickly and everything was really good. As we sat outside, we noticed broken glass at our feet. When the server came over to check on us, we told her about the glass, and she told us that it had been there since the previous morning. This made me a bit nervous--I worked at a corporate restaurant for many years and broken glass was like a 5 alarm fire. Also, I am very pregnant, so the glass at my sandaled feet made my husband nervous. After we told the server about the glass, she sent a kitchen guy out with a broom, but he swept the other side of the patio, no where near the glass. She said he would clean up the glass once we left, but then quickly sat the table next to us, also surrounded by glass. This in not a huge deal, but oversights such as this at a new restaurant make me a bit nervous about what else might be overlooked.  The food and service was good, and we may return.",

For me, Oink is great alternative to IHOP (meh) and Chompie's (good, but overwhelming). It's a locally-owned neighborhood spot for a good breakfast in an intimate setting. We've never had an issue with the food or the service. When we were there last month the owner was walking to each table, talking to customers, and just making sure they/we were ok. This morning we went with friends and the GM was doing the same thing. He stopped at our table, made a genuine effort to talk to us and our kids (making a big to-do about hanging their pig pictures on the wall), and made sure we were well taken care of. Stuff like this goes a long way with me, and is a big reason why I will keep coming back. I always order the Pig in a Blanket which never disappoints. Love this place! There have been so many restaurants come and go in this space over the years. . . .I hope this one stays for a while.",

    "text": "My husband and I have eaten at Oink Cafe twice. First time was the week they opened, early on a Thursday morning. Food was good, service was fine, but there was only one other customer besides us. Today we went there at 7:30 on Saturday, the place was almost empty when we got there but quickly filled up. First off, they were out of their homemade turkey sausage, that I wanted to try. I changed my order to Huevos Rancheros, and was really disappointed. The eggs were fine, but the beans were greasy, I could see a layer of lard floating on top of them. At $8.99 I thought it was really over priced. My husband had the pancake combo with bacon, he thought the bacon was over cooked, and the pancakes were almost raw, they were gummy and severly undercooked. As for service, our coffee was never refilled, once our food was dropped off we were completely ignored until the check was left. Customers around us were complaining, the woman behind us had to order her tea 3 times before it arrived, the man behind us complained that his order was wrong, many customers seemed unhappy with the wait and the service. I was really disappointed, I realize that they have only been open a couple of weeks, so we might return in a few months, if they survive that long. It's really too bad, I like small, locally owned restaurants, but the experience today was so bad that I'm not in any hurry to return. They got 2 stars, because our first visit was fine.",

Bacon is obviously king at Oink and the jalapeno bacon is great. Once we went and they had a mango habanero bacon that was some of the best bacon I've ever eaten. If you're in the area and in the mood for some amazing pancakes, delicious french toast, or a phenomenal waffle, I highly recommend you stop by.",

    "text": "Nice place to get some Breakfast or Lunch in the PV Mall area. Inside is somewhat simple with the basic PIG theme (Oink). They have both booths and tables that you can request. Gets really busy and you will probably have to wait a bit. So get there a little early and get your name on the list. We went shopping next door and got back right when they called our name. Perfect timing.  The menu has a large selection of most of your favorite breakfast dishes as well as a lunch menu with burgers and sandwiches. They also serve soup, an array of salads, oatmeal, yogurt with granola, mac and cheese, chicken, fish and chips, and even chicken fried steak.  Today my Yelp friend and I did the breakfast dance. I ordered the The OINK Omelette which has 5 eggs and is stuffed with a bunch of the meat group covered with cheddar cheese. Had to try a side of the Half Flight of Bacon which is 4 out of the 8 choices of flavored Bacon strips and a side of what they call ranchero sauce for my omelette.  Our server Cheyenne was both friendly and most accommodating even though the restaurant was totally packed. She made sure that we had everything we needed and then some.  The food was tasty yet somewhat average and the bacon was a little pricey. Would have liked a thicker cut of the Bacon as well as it being cooked a little slower to prevent shrinkage. After all it is served on a butcher block. Thick BABY! The Omelette was tasty and quite filling. What they call ranchero sauce is really more of a New Mexico style enchilada sauce. Ranchero sauce is usually more of a fresh sauce cooked with tomatoes, onion, peppers, garlic and herbs. I bet their version would taste great on one of their burrito options. Hmm?  Definitely worth a visit when you are shopping and getting ready to drop. Open every day from 7 am to 2pm. Enjoy!",

Not to mention the five different ways that bacon is prepared (applewood smoked, honey cured, sugar cured, peppered, jalapeno).  I found my experience very pleasant as I parked, sat down with no waiting late on a Saturday morning, and was greeting almost right away.  Don't get me wrong...there were still a lot of people in the restaurant, and it appeared that everyone was enjoying themselves.  The service was outstanding as my waitress was very pleasant and helpful and continued to stop by to check on my father and me.    The food itself was very good.  Both my father and I ordered traditional breakfasts (to keep it simple for our first time at the Oink Cafe).  He ordered applewood smoked bacon, extra crispy while I ordered honey cured bacon.  Both orders were delicious!  The rest of the breakfast resembled any other breakfast restaurant though the dishes were still good.  As an entire package (the food, service, wait, atmosphere), it was definitely worth the trip.  Plus, there are some coupons online for 15% off your bill, $1 off any gourmet drink, or a free maple bacon donut (at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.8coupons.com%2Fdiscounts%2Fthe-oink-cafe-phoenix-85032&s=6ce1880fdec47462800f690216afbb32e055a89ec2c168039c911e0198222fca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">8coupons.com/discounts/t...</a>).   Oh, and if you're not a fan of bacon, there are plenty of non-bacon breakfast and lunch dishes, too!",

    "text": "We had wanted to try the Oink Cafe for a long time. Unfortunately, we tried it today.  We went late, our fault, and there was a wait. Only about 20 min and they were accurate in their estimate of the wait. The decor is, I don't know, off. There are large images of pigs on the wall in some places and big expanses of empty wall in others. Oh, and the colors are a little much for a breakfast restaurant.  Initially the service was good, but that deteriorated too.  The worst part was the food. I ordered a build your own omelette and my partner had Ham Steak and eggs with a tortilla. He's on a low carb regimen right now. He enjoyed his, but the presentation was lackluster at best. Two eggs (ordered over medium and cooked over easy) the ham steak and a tortilla all on a white plate. No garnish, just white eggs, a slightly pink piece of ham and a beige totilla on a white plate. Not very appetizing at all! I felt sorry for him.  I ordered an egg white omlette with spinach, tomatoes and cheddar. I would have preferred Feta, but they don't have it on the menu. Mine came with home fries and an English Muffin. Oh, and the omellette I received was regular eggs not egg whites. Yes, I could have said something, but I was starving at that point and just wanted to eat. The weirdest part of the omlette was the cheese on the outside. Who the heck puts cheese on the outside of an omlette?  For $25 bucks for two I would have expected more food and better quality.  After brunch we made a quick stop at Target, but then we had to run home as the meal made me ill.   Sorry Oink, we won't be back.",

Great variety on the menu and always great service. However depending on who is working the patio it tends to get forgotten and sometimes there has been confusion on who is actually waiting on us. Management is on top of it and has always noticed before we waited too long but I have had to point out to them one time when they seated two ladies on the patio on a rather hot day and 10 minutes went by before they were even offered water. But they made up for it with very quick playing. The flight of bacon is my favorite!",

Our server was busy, but she made it a point to touch our table and acknowledge us and let us know she'd be with us in just a minute. Appreciated the acknowledgement.   We split the Arizona Omelette with fruit and hash browns and 1/3 flight of bacon. And OJ.   Recommend Sour Cream with Arizona Omelette. Just needs it.   1/2 Flight of bacon we chose 2 sides of the Pecan, the chef special, a jalapeno bacon and apple wood.  Applewood was the favorite.   Hash browns we're good, not exceptional.  Fruit was a little mushy, so not much was eaten but it's all good.   Food took a little longer, but to be expected because of a busy morning.   Will definitely be back when in the area.",

They get a full 5 stars for the next part:  This place has a great kids menu and coloring pages for the kids. They didn't freak out when my one year old needed to get down and wander around for a bit, but when they decided they preferred him in his seat, they offered him a bowl of blueberries as bribery. A million thanks for people who know how to handle little kids in a restaurant for the parents insane enough to try to bring them out every so often.",

I tried it with salsa and it was better but still not really what I had hoped for. The pork was super dry and the ratio of pork and egg/potato was 80/20. I didn't really want a pork burrito, I wanted an egg burrito.   Macchiato: DELICIOUS!!!!!!!! I loved every second of it! Will get one every time, should I go back!   Bacon Donut: I read reviews online that said to heat it up, so I did warm it up for 30 seconds, and I'm glad I did! So warm, sweet, salty and delicious. This donut made up for the meal not being good.   I'd go back for a donut and coffee, to-go, if I was in the area. I probably would not stop in for a meal.",

    "text": "A day out with the kiddos is fun. Beforehand, L pointed out that she loves Oink Cafe, and that the home fries and bacon are amazing. Well then! Don't threaten me with a good time! Bring on the bacon!  At the south end of a strip mall, this place has an awkward entrance to the north, where I almost ate pavement when there was a step up that wasn't marked, and I was too busy ogling bacon paraphernalia in the windows. There was a good line, but we learned that one was a party of 5, and the other two parties of 2. So, a 10 minute wait...not bad. The gal at the reception was learning, and it was a bit jumbled. There was an older gal barking at her in front of the patrons, which was also a little awkward for everyone around.   There was so much porkaphernalia to see! Toys and bakery items, chalkboard menus with specials and pictures everywhere. There was a bar, but I noticed only coffee items. The sandwich boards came from the likes of Four Peaks and San Tan, so I'm guessing they serve beer as well?  L ordered a half flight of bacon and some home fries. The bacon she chose was sugar-cured. J chose some eggs and toast. He wasn't feeling well, but I saw him steal a half-piece of bacon. I opted for the bacon and egg sandwich, sugar-cured bacon, on a homemade biscuit. We also shared a maple bacon donut. I ordered an iced chai as well.  The home fries were so small, that the frying made them hard. The bacon wasn't anything to write home about. The chai was watery and not at all flavorful. The menu had a blatant lack of pork. Ok, so you have some bacon. No pork belly? No sausage specialties? No pork sandwiches or steaks? Hmm. Ok. Also, walking past the kitchen, I didn't notice a full kitchen. So, how are these things being made? Are you just spraying flavor on pieces of bacon?   Staff was inattentive, and the bill exorbitant for what we ordered. The wait exceeded the stars on this one. I wouldn't return.",

The only things is have the complain about are the occasional raw bacon. Now this place is known for the various types of bacon which is why the chef should be well aware of the implications of not completely frying a piece or placing raw bacon on a burger to cook. The ice tea tastes old also. Aside for these issues it was a good experience.",

I ordered the biscuits & gravy which was delicious & more than enough. I also added 2 eggs. The hash browns are simple, but good. My husband ordered the pork confit benedict. The hollandaise sauce is one of my favorite that I've encountered-great tang to it. The eggs were a little bit too raw, but not bad for us (but we like over easy/medium eggs). The coffee was strong, but good & our waitress was extremely helpful",

We didn't watch television, but it does have a few flat panel TVs that would be nice during football season on a weekend.  The space was child friendly - nice menu although they didn't offer crayons to kids, which they said they were in the process of incorporating.    Menu was huge and offered lots of traditional breakfast combinations. I had the waffle with eggs and sausage. I ordered the pigs in a blanket for my children. It is prepared with sausage that was fantastic. The perfect amount of spice and wrapped in pancakes that were also really good. My waffle was wonderful.  Really light and fluffy but with the perfect amount of crunch on the outside.  My friend ordered the French Toast, which was coated in captain crunch cereal (this sounds odd, but it was incredibly good and the bacon served with it balanced out the sweetness) and served with her choice of bacon. She ordered the applewood smoked bacon. It was excellent. They have five different types of bacon, including one infused with jalapeno, which I will try next time.   The service was a bit slow, but understandable given it was the first week of opening.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone for a nice neighborhood breakfast spot!",

Had breakfast at the Oink Cafe got lousy service,  greasy link sausages and hash browns,  and mmisoma made with cheap Cupcake champagne. I had ordered patties sausages and got links. My wife ordered mmisoma so I asked for one too. Lucky the server forgot mines. My wife had barely drunk hers and offered me to taste it. The mmisoma was bitter due to the champagne. The server brought us our bill, first time returning after bringing our breakfast. I told her about the sausage, hash browns, mmisoma, etc. She spoke with her manager and took 10% off the bill. That was a joke! It was coded military/senior. I'll over 60 and look every bit. I was already entitled to a 10% discount. Just go to Butterfield Restaurant for a superb breakfast and fantastic service.",

We had to ask twice for the bacon donut  holes (Yum!) which he finally brought but seemed a little confused as to what exactly they were.  He did have the manager remove our two Bloody Mary's.

    "text": "First off, the food was excellent. However, the service almost made me leave before I even ordered. Granted, I went in on a Sunday morning and it was busy. When I approached the hostess stand I asked how I could order takeout. Before the hostess answered we were interrupted by a man who was possibly the owner or manager. He sent her to take care of something and walked away also leaving me standing there by myself. So I next approached the register where a cashier appeared to be either cashing out an order or entering an order. The only greeting I received after standing there was when the server held up her finger as a gesture to tell me to wait but she said nothing. After I patiently waited for about two minutes I moved over to the counter and waited until the owner/mgr took my order. After giving my order I left for a few minutes to shop while my order cooked. When I returned it was difficult to find someone to help me pick up my order. There was a very nice, but busy lady helping at the counter. I overheard her say she was a school teacher helping the family out and she was kind and helpful. I had the biscuits and gravy which were great, my daughters ate up all of their bacon pancakes, and my husband enjoyed an omelette.   My family has lived in Phoenix for about 4 years and we have seen 3 restaurants open and close in that location since then. We are really hoping that the Oink Cafe is able to make something out of the location. I will probably return when things get settled because the food was good but if the service and apathy toward customers is a similar experience I won't likely give it a 2nd try.",

    "text": "First time here....we live within 5 minutes but have waited to visit to allow them some time to work out the initial kinks of a new restaurant based on previous Yelp reviews.  We got there around 10:00'ish on a Sunday morning.  We were seated right away and got our drinks right away.  Restaurant did not seem overly busy to me. We had some questions about the menu, got them answered and placed our order.  We ordered the Paradise Valley Omelette and the Steak and Eggs.  It took 27 minutes for them to deliver our first entree'. The omelette was hot off the press, steaming and had some really nice hot, stringy cheese.  The Steak and Eggs was a completely different story.  The steak was cold, overcooked and tough.  Enough said so I sent it back. My next entree' (Eggs Benedict) came out in 5 minutes and it looked great.  However, the English Muffin was barely toasted, the ham was super thin, and the Hollandaise was tasty but it basically formed a pool on the plate.  There were some positives.  We ordered a side of the Jalepeno Bacon and it was really good.  I had the side of Biscuits and Gravy on the Steak and Eggs entree and the biscuits were good.  You could tell they were homemade.  Also, the homemade sausage gravy was great.  Our waitress was really great and really seemed to know the menu well.  She did comp the Eggs Benedict entree after we talked about how weak the Steak and Eggs came out from the kitchen.  The food runner needed some help in a big way....I just kept seeing him flash in and out of the kitchen and running through the dining room.   The bakery items looked really good so I might go back to try them sometime in the future.   Overall, I'd say about 2.5 stars but I've definitely had better breakfasts at other restaurants in the area.  I'm not completely convinced that I'd go back unless I knew it was going to be a better overall experience.",

Then we tried again a week or so later and were seated- no warning about the length of time to be served and it was over an hour before we and several tables around us were served. They offered us a free pastry but did not comp anything off of the bill. That was disappointing. Food was ok. Hopefully they will get it together because I would love to make this place a regular stop. I can see them really making something of the theme buy selling bacon themed items like bacon popcorn, bacon band aides, bacon scarves, bacon wallets, bacon lamps, etc...a little bacon shop within the place.",

I gave it four stars for the food and effort! Plus where do they get these stemless mimosa glasses!",

My guy and I stopped for breakfast Saturday morning, it took awhile to be seated but once we were the service wasn't bad for as busy as they were.  We both got eggs, hash browns, bacon and toast. I ordered my Applewood smoked bacon extra crispy, he ordered the jalapeno bacon not crispy.  This is where the stars began to fall.  It took forever for our food to arrive.  Several people who came in after us had their meals and were finished by the time ours arrived.  The hashbrowns were hot, the eggs warm and unfortunately his bacon was extra crispy and mine wasn't even close to crispy.    I don't mind the food mixup so much as the waiting.  We will give them another try and I will update then.",

We missed bacon covered pastry and the bacon flight which is 8 pieces of bacon, one of each kind sold.   The only problem was that my plate apparently waited for the omelette as toast and hash browns were barely warm. All the food tasted good.",

But I work hard for the little money I make. At a restaurant in fact so I know what's at stake. It's not with pride that I make this 2 star review. It's in hope that the truth will motivate you.  But for real, I've come in here like 6 times over the course of 8 weeks. The food is mediocre, edible greasy spoon stuff but that doesn't match the scenery. Though the staff is nice enough, I had the (mis)pleasure of sitting at the \"bar\" which apparently is where the staff goes to do their b****ing and I was thoroughly disappointed, particularly by the older one with silver hair - she doesn't seem like she has one sympathetic molecule in her body. All face value nothing genuine there at all. Anyway, I can handle all that I work at a bar and restaurant I know how it goes. But the final straw was waiting a longer than it took to cook and eat my food for me to receive my check. Quite actually, 21 minutes. And it wasn't even my server who noticed.",

First of all for what you get it's expensive. $8-$9. They all tasted the same except for the peppered bacon somewhat stood out.   I ordered the Arizona omelette because I love chorizo. You literally couldn't even taste or see the chorizo. It seemed like one big blended omelette. Kind of weird. Plus it's SMOTHERED in \"ranchero\" sauce. It's this dark red thick spicy sauce. I would ask for it on the side if you're going to order it.   My boyfriend got the breakfast burger. He didn't seem too thrilled.   To be honest, I know it's the \"oink cafe\" but it was almost pork overload. And I don't really enjoy staring at pictures of cute cartoon pigs all over the walls while I eat bacon.

Hadn't been here before so when I walked in I stood at what I learned is their to-go counter for a good solid 90 seconds before anyone acknowledged me. There were six people behind the counter, & not one gave me eye contact or a simple hello. SIX. Not a good first impression. Once I was told to go ahead & take a seat a young lady dropped off a menu & silverware rollup. She said nothing, did not offer water or tell me my server would be right with me. I realize this is a very casual place but still, when guests are tipping for service it should be welcoming & attentive at the very least.  Food is pretty much what I expected. BLT was great--nice & big, delicious bacon (good thing since this is what they're supposed to be known for!). I added avocado which was fresh and tasty. Fruit salad was the generic pineapple, underripe honeydew, grape combo... but even at The Phoenician the fruit is this way!  Overall, good food, but after tax I wouldn't come & spend $11+ on a BLT (and that's without the avocado). Decent atmosphere, despite the bright yellow & green walls and very harsh fluorescent lighting. Very cute patio.",

A touch overpriced for breakfast food, making them a bit less competitive for the surrounding area.

Omelettes are delicious and coffee good as well. Enjoy! Long live Bacon!!",

First time was was shopping at Target and my wife wanted to stop in and get an iced coffee. Got denied as the espresso machine was already off and cleaned for next days use. Manager gave use a coupon for two free specialty drinks so that was very thoughtful. While checking out the place I noticed a special on the wall and it was a sonoran hot dog. For 6 bucks I got the bacon wrapped dog, side of fries, and roasted jalapeno, Serrano, and onion. Great presentation and excellent taste. This was a 3-4 star visit although not getting what we came in for the sonoran hot dog saved the day.  2nd trip. Went in for breakfast wielding our 2 free specialty drink coupons. Waitress took our drink order (two iced americano's) and they came out hot. No biggie lets order food. Waitress' customer service skills were that of a high school kid at his first job. Lady was very blunt and did not act like she cared. Food came out to order but the frozen hash browns were over cooked and couldn't get a water refill.   Had the maple glazed bacon donut and it was basically a sugar cake glazed in maple with bad n bits on top. nothing special.  3 stars and will try this place again eventually.",

The hostess passed us over because she can't confirm what she heard.  In the meantime people just walked up and sat at the bar. Great....so we did the same. The problem is understaffing and mis-staffing. The bar guy is responsible for so much that he's super busy but others are standing around laughing, not rushing and most importantly not helping out. The food was decent but nothing special. The bacon of course is outstanding but the little things are missed.",

    "text": "First let me say this.  They have only been open a few days, and I will give them another try AFTER they get all their kinks worked out.  My fiance and I went Saturday morning around 10am for breakfast.  First there was no one at the door or a sign that said please wait to be seated or seat your self, so we walked up and found a server and asked.  They just said find an open table, which we did.  After 10 minutes we flagged down a server to get a drink order and then menus.  Drinks took forever.  First they ran out of coffee and then coffee mugs.  We sat and watched many people sit down, wait, and then just walk out because no one even acknowledged them.    We got our ordered placed and then heard from other tables around us that they had been waiting over an hour for their food.  Luckily we weren't in a hurry.  I had the cafe fresh toast and my fiance had some eggs and bacon with a side of biscuits and gravy.  Their food was VERY good.  I Loved mine!  The biscuits and gravy were the best we have had in Phoenix (I'm not too sure if that is saying all that much though).  The food took about 30 minutes.  We constantly had to ask for coffee refills.  I think the servers were doing their best.    Either they were not prepared for a busy morning or they really had no clue what they were doing in the back of the house or front for that matter.  I hope they can pull it together because the food was very good.  Like I said I will go back for another try and re-rate they in a month or two.  I would recommend it to others as long as they know going in that it might be a Cluster.",

Our waitress was working her butt off and gave us free muffins (which were delish) while we waited. We ended up getting two free meals for our troubles. The second visit was much better and the food came at a reasonable time. I think they're just working out the kinks since they're new.   Pros: The food is really good and they're pastries looked awesome. My kids loved the mini coloring books and were given a free cookie. The bacon was delicious. Friendly atmosphere and the staff is trying.   Cons: long wait and slow kitchen but I think they're trying and improving.   Hope this place succeeds! The food is worth it.",

I went twice and left after being told there was a 45 minute wait for a table. On the third time, we had a 20 minute wait. But once we were seated, our waitress was so busy and overloaded that it took 15 minutes to get our WATER. As a former waitress, I know I'm not being unreasonable in saying that THAT is UNREASONABLE. And then we ordered 2 different side orders of bacon (jalapeno and honey-cured), thinking that a place that supposedly specializes in bacon would have mind-blowing bacon. No. It was normal bacon. Our lives were not changed. It's a cute place but I would not recommend it to anyone unless I knew they had NO other plans for the day, because they would have to spend most of their morning sitting and waiting for average bacon.",

    "text": "Well... with a name like Oink, I expected a cute place full of piggies, bacon infused items, and smokehouse smells.  With fun outdoor windows with cute quotes like... \"warning: bacon smell is imminent\" I hoped for another breakfast joint to add to our local list of favorites like Chez Vous.  Unfortunately, the food did not stand out by any measure.  We sat outside at a wonderful table smelling some scrumptious things from inside.  After looking thoroughly over the menu, we decided we had to try plates with bacon and sausage, signatures off their name, right?  We ordered the Oink Burger - a HUGE sausage patty with hashbrowns and a fried egg on top of a bun - and 2 eggs with hashbrowns, toast, and the applewood bacon.  Now if you're like me, you're envisioning thick, smoked bacon and flavorful sausage.  After waiting for the food to arrive, we held our opinions until after tasting the food.  The bacon had a nice flavor, but was very thin and overcooked.  The Oink burger had the makings of a winner, but the almost 2\" sausage patty had no flavor and so bland I cut it in half to make a thinner patty.  I think the best thing on the plate was the hashbrowns.    Our waitress was very nice even though she had so many tables to serve she was not able to provide refills on our drinks - something we can easily overlook.  I REALLY wanted to love this place... Sadly we didn't find enough amazing differentiators or flavors to drive us back.  I suggest the owners go visit some smokehouses in the south - like Loveless Cafe in Nashville - and bring us some new award worthy dishes!",

There'd usually be a 1/2 pound of meat covered with the freshest condiments you might ask for.  Having come from a dairy ranch where they got the freshest beef you could ask for,  any beef they bought had to be up to their standards.  I ate well when we had hamburgers.  My mushroom with swiss burger was the first I have had in a long  time that brought back those child hood memories.  The Burger itself is really to big for two hands to hold and I have large hands.  So the bottom bun got soggy.  The beef was fresh enough for it to get that way as you bite into the beef and tastes good in the process!  My friend had a burger with bacon on it.  They have eight kinds of bacon to choose from.  She had sugar cured and it was thick cut and yummy.  I am going to go out on a limb and say I think the Oink has the best burgers in Phoenix!",

He ordered the one with the shredded meat on it.... can't even recall what it was....but it not anything even worth remembering. Let me say, the concept of Oinks seems good as does the decor and such, but come on, there should be more bacon choices in the menu (options with bacon in them) and when a dish states there is bacon in it, it should be awesome, chunky, full of flavor bacon - nothing like we experienced.

My boyfriend on the other hand gets the healthy choice omelet and oatmeal. I will admit sometimes we have a stellar experience and sometimes its questionable. The little tables in the middle are really awkward with people walking by on both sides you almost feel in the way -we always wait for a table or booth. Overall one of our favorite spots.",

We waited way too long for our bill to be returned to us once we gave her our CC. There was nothing spectacular about the food. I asked for hollandaise sauce for my omelet and paid $2.49 for about 2 tablespoons. I could get more flavor for less at Denny's. I expect better service for the prices.",

I was here a few days ago and the server was excellent (never let my coffee run out!), my French toast was good, but the bacon was SO disappointing! It had zero flavor and looked like they had taken one piece and sliced it in half. They were 2 flimsy, skinny slices that looked like they came from a fast food place. I couldn't believe it. After the disappointment of this last visit I probably won't be back anytime soon.",

Despite that we were greeted and  seated as soon as we walked in.  The waitress was very friendly without bring overbearing.  The Bacon Bloody Mary was one of the best I have ever had.  Our food came out quickly.  It was very full of flavor.  The flight of bacon was excellent.  The Ranchero Sauce was made by someone who really knew what they were doing.  The taste was exciting and full of flavor.  The servings were plentiful without leaving me feeling like I ate too much.  The owner stopped at our table despite the large crowd that was on hand to say hello and check on us. An excellent place which will be on my short list to visit again.",

Coffee is simply standard old brewed restaurant coffee, but they do have specialty espresso based drinks, that I did not try. I will definitely be back.",

As far as the food goes, the Paradise Valley omelet was phenomenal and I could taste the freshness -- I also substituted the applewood smoked bacon for the jalapeno bacon (they have 8 different flavors of bacon). We also tried the bacon maple donut -- this is an absolute MUST TRY!!!! Oink Cafe exceeded our expectations and I will definitely be returning again.",

They came out warm and crunchy, heaven on a plate. Not something you want to eat on a regular basis, but what a treat! With my cup of mocha coffee, I really could have stopped there but didn't...I wanted to try their bacon. They offer a ridiculous 8 varieties... even a flight lol!  I ordered the 2 eggs home fries and bacon. It was served with a delicious biscuit and the home fries came out exactly as I ordered them -- very well done and delicious. My sister loved her meal as well and even wants to return a second time while she's here. Who am I to deny her of that?",

There was 2 servers, one was in training (I'm assuming) and this wasn't explained either. The server never got my drink refill and also managed to screw up my order.

    "text": "I suggest you order the Bacon Flight, a sampling of eight varieties of bacon, to accompany whatever else you are ordering. You'll then be on your way to refining your bacon palette. The flight will add about nine bucks to the cost of your meal, but it's a delightful item to share if you are socializing with friends or family. Every visitor to The Oink Cafe needs to order the flight at least once.  Servers at Oink are very friendly and helpful. They do a nice job of making recommendations and keeping your coffee cup filled. The cafe itself finds a middle ground, with solid food served at reasonable prices. Not a cheap diner nor a too trendy premium dining spot. The menu is not that innovative, except for a willingness to throw bacon into anything, which is fun. Ordering the eight bacon flight is essential to appreciating the bacon varieties. If nothing else, you'll then know which bacon to request on your next visit. If you don't have this basis for comparison, you'll just think the bacon with your meal is well, bacon. You won't be able to appreciate what differentiates Oink from other breakfast spots.  The restaurant is housed in an odd long and narrow space, but there's a deceptive amount of seating. There can still be a wait, however, at peak times. There is also a small dog friendly patio for outside dining. Oink is kid friendly, with a \"little piggies\" menu and a pig to color while waiting to be served. If you appreciate art, you'll enjoy the large number of the pig masterpieces from previous diners on display.",

Twice I've taken my 81 yr old mother who does not get around well to this place.  It's less than a mile from our house.  The first time there was a 20 min wait.  No biggie, there was a chair for her sit.  There were 5 groups ahead of us and a number of groups that came after.  We'd been waiting 10 min or so when a couple came in after everyone else and waited less than 5 mins.  The lady manager took them to a table that seats 4 that had just opened up.  You could tell this couple were regulars and a favorite of hers.  Two of the groups ahead of us were a group of 4 and a group of 5.  Those of us that were standing there couldn't believe it.  Everyone was annoyed, but didn't say anything - my mistake there.  Finally got seated.  It's a few weeks later and thought I would take mother and try one more time.  Get there and it's a 5 min wait.  No one waiting in front and and a few  people walking in behind us.  The young gal asks if we would like to sit at the counter and we say no, we would like a table.  Not one minute goes by, a young mother and her child come, and again all of us are passed over and they seat them at a table  that has just opened up and proceed to take us to a booth.  We very specifically had said table.  My mother has trouble in booths.  They coud have very well taken the mother and child to the booth.  I see that the lady manger knows the mother and is taking care of them.  WHAT THE???  My mother and I look at each other and decide this place isn't worth our money.  The hostess that seated us asks if everthing is okay and this time my mother says something.  The best the gal does is a hollow apology and not an offer of anything.  We're not the type of people to expect anything, but not even an offer after this stupidity?!  To be that rude and disrespectful twice, to not only us, but to the people who are also waiting is inexcusable.  It's a shame since all of the servers we have had are very good and I would give them 4 stars.  I'm done with this place.  Butterfields and U.S. Egg are MUCH better choices and worth driving to.",

Seemed as if she was expecting her tip regardless of the service she provided.  If I wanted the \"fast food type service,\" I wouldn't have gone to a sit down. We will definitely not be going back.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to expectations. With a name like Oink you'd think they would get really creative but other than offering several eight types of bacon and maple glazed bacon donuts, they don't really seem to do all that much with it.   We ordered the bacon flight to sample all of the different types and then our individual meals. I had the 50/50 burger which is described as 1/2 ground bacon and 1/2 ground beef. It was good, but the bacon flavor wasn't nearly as tasty as I expected. My wife had two eggs and bacon which also came with hashbrowns. She noted that the hashbrowns were boring and the eggs and bacon weren't any better than other breakfast places. My kids ate pancakes and pigs in a blanket off of the kid's menu which didn't seem to include any specialty bacon offerings.  As stated, for a place that claims to specialize in pork products, there really didn't seem to be many. For a start, how about pork belly, bacon-flavored hot chocolate, or even just the ability to order a plate of a specific type of bacon. Yes, the bacon flight is nice but the presentation was lacking, basically just 8 strips on a plate. I'm sure a creative chef could come up with even more ideas.Right now Oink has a good name but they definitely need to work on the execution.",

Right away the window opened and my friendly waitress greeted me. The menus are kind of like place mats outside. Very straight forward with yummy options. I was impressed to see that they has a flight of bacon as a menu option. 8 different bacons as a meal choice?! I ultimately chose the pork confit Benedict. It was delicious. The shredded pork was so tender. It melted in my mouth as I chewed. I enjoyed the hollandaise sauce as well, thick and creamy. I had a side option of fruit, hash browns or home fries. I got the hash browns. No complaint there! Really good breakfast place. I can't decide if I want pigs in a blanket or an omelet for next time!",

I decided to come back the next day and see if yesterday was a fluke. Since we generally liked our original visit over a year ago but at the time we found things somewhat uneven.  Well the good news to report is that since my first visit with fellow Yelp'ers and Pepper Head Mark, things have improved. Service can be a bit slow during busy periods, they have definitely improved. The sad sausage I had eighteen months ago has been retired. It's been replaced by a very flavorful one (see photos).  Today we ordered the French Toast and the Oink's French Toast. The latter is just over the top sweet and a bit too much for this gourmand. While the regular French Toast would be enjoyed by every Gourmet as being just right. Look that up in your Roget's. LOL  Expect to pay $15 each if you don't order a 4 piece (1/2 flight) or 8 piece (full flight) of their absolutely delicious thick flavored bacon. If you do, and I would recommend that you do, then expect to pay accordingly, around $22-$25.  But ohhh, but it's sooo worth it!  Enjoy!",

The infamous bacon flight is impressive, though expensive. It IS very high quality bacon--much better than what I usually get at the grocery store. The taste differences are quite noticeable.   I had the strawberry chicken salad. It was the full size, and it wasn't huge.Okay, I knew this was a place known for breakfast food and bacon, and yeah, the salad was just okay. The chicken didn't have a lot of flavor and had obviously just been pulled from the fridge. It wasn't bad by any means.  My husband had four pancakes. He's a guy with a big appetite, and he was defeated by these pancakes. They took up a whole platter. The sample I had was light, fluffy, and everything a pancake should be.   Oink Cafe definitely knows their breakfast stuff. It's pretty far from us, but I'd be okay with visiting again if we were in the area.",

Fast forward to present day and since we were at Target, we thought we would give this place another try and see if it has improved.  So glad we did!!  I LOVE eggs benedict and it's so hard to find a place that serves it just right - where the poached egg is perfectly done so that the yolk explodes into yumminess when you poke into it.  This place has it down to a science.  I have had their eggs benedict every time we have been back (4 times since) and I have yet to be disappointed.  The service is also great!  I do have to say the bacon itself still has much to be desired.  I'm not a huge fan because their bacon is really thin...but the eggs benny?  YUMMM.",

For me, I could frame the experience around the home fries. I was looking forward to nice griddle finished home fries. You know the ones - soft potato with a crispy brown/black edge from the griddle top, with flavorful seasoning? Yeah, that's not what they do here. Instead you take cubed potatoes and throw them in the deep fryer, creating little square marbles that lack the texture and flavor of True home fries. Essentially, they are phoning in the effort on this part of the menu.  Service was friendly but ended on a sour note. I was her only customer yet it took five minutes to run my credit cards. Let's call it a minute to run the dirty dishes back to the dishroom, and then four minutes of chatting with a customer at the counter about cell phone plans.   With all of the great breakfast places nearby, including Joybus Diner and Perk, there's simply no reason to go back.",

We did like the coffee, so glad more breakfast places have have raised the coffee standard.   Give this place a try.",

How can you not love BACON! It's the best thing on the planet! So I was pretty stoked to be headed to Oink.  I do have to say they make a mean up cup of coffee, I drink my coffee black unless its whack then I doc it up, but Oink's was perfectly great straight up black!   I ordered the bacon stuffed pancake with a side of bacon, I had been picturing thick slices of apple wood smoked bacon ( I don't know why it was apple wood smoked in my head, but it just was) and I couldn't wait to get my teeth into it! What I got was a slice on the thin side, it was cooked the way like, not too crispy, not too soft, just wasn't what I was expecting. But the bacon stuffed pancakes OOOMMMMGGGG!!! Every bite was loaded with bacon, it was SWEET BLISS!! Maple syrup drenched pancakes loaded with salty pieces of bacon; it was heaven, pure heaven! All pancakes should be that way! haha  I also ordered a dozen bacon donut holes for my son, who is a bacon lovin fool too.  I enjoyed my breakfast and look forward to coming back for some more of them bacon stuffed pancakes!",

Every time I go to Matt's I get friendly service and PERFECT breakfast...and they are the only place in the Valley that get's the 5 stars for breakfast (at least in my book).   That being said, we have been to Oink Cafe a few times and are impressed.   This is a bacon place. They have about 8 different kinds of bacon, and all are really yummy.   The Omelettes are pretty damned good, I have to say. The Country Potatoe's are really good, as well. The egg and meat (think bacon) dishes are very good.   So, if you can't make it to Matt's, come here. They're on to something, and it's very, very good.",

More so than a normal patio where you would see the occasional fly. They really seem to be in abundance here. Also sometimes the food doesn't come out as hot as it should.

I tried the pork confit benedict. It was pretty delish. The pork was falling apart and had delicious flavor, the eggs were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was good too. Definite winning dish. The BF got the bacon pancakes again this time, and he said they were also much better. The batter tasted more homemade versus batter from the box. The prices are still a touch high, in my opinion, but I would definitely go back here because the food was very good. Nice job Oink!",

The wait on the weekend can get long so get there early. They only take reservations for 6 or more.  They have a cute patio that allows dogs, but I normally end up sitting inside at a booth. The service is very friendly and they remember us every time we come in. They have an awesome Oink Bloody Mary, that includes a strip of your choice of bacon (they have 7 kinds). The mimosas are nice and refreshing too. I normally order the Pancake Combo, now i do not traditionally like pancakes or sweets at all, but they do them right here. I always have them add fresh blueberries, YUM! It comes with that perfectly cooked egg and the meat of your choice. I really like the sugar cured or jalapeno bacon. The Bacon is not very thick and could be a little more impressive since that is the whole theme of the restaurant, but its still good.  I have also ordered the Pigs in a Blanket. The portion is huge! It is three full sized pancakes (with blueberries for me) stuffed with a sausage link, served with your choice of potato.  I really like the people and food here... check it out.",

I had read some reviews including on Yelp ranging from very good all the way to I'll never eat here as long as I live.  I just had to try it myself:  Appearance: 8/10 There are 2 ways to get in the place.  However, you can only get it one way to be seated.  The place was crowded including people who were eating outside.  The place looked very clean I thought  Friendliness 9/10 The crew was very nice and friendly.  Even heard a couple waiters (including mine) joke around with each other saying how one is more awesome than the other! :)  Wait time 5/10 My wait time was roughly around 20-25 minutes and this was at lunchtime on a weekend.  I have seen quite a few tables empty when I came in so I was confused as to why there had been a line  in the first place.  When you wait outside, they have benches you can sit on.  However, this may be a problem when it gets hot, especially in the phoenix summer.  In the inside,  there is just 1 single chair so more than likely you would be standing on your feet until you are seated.    Prices  5/10  I won't lie,  they are quite expensive.  I came in myself,  got a pop,  and a French Toast Combo (4 French toast, 2 sausages and 1 egg).  The bill came up to almost 13 bucks just for 1 person.  I don't think anything on the menu was anything less than 7 bucks.    Food 7/10 The food itself wasn't bad.  I actually got it within 5-10 minutes after ordering so it was warm when I got it.  It wasn't good but it wasn't bad either.  It didn't seem like much when you get it and I didn't feel totally full when I had left.     OVERALL 34/50  68% D+ Can't say I was impressed when I have read the reviews before coming here.  However, its not the worse place in the world either.  Maybe it was the name of the place that made me curious to try it for myself.  I would only go if you are already in the area (getting a haircut, going to Target/Dollar Tree, etc.) and just feel like trying it.   Then again, you got IHOP right across the street.  Remember they only serve breakfast and lunch so they close by 2 or 3 in the afternoon.",

The menu is simple and the staff did not mind me asking them a bunch of questions at are first and second visit. I ate your basic meal the first day Veggie Omelet and tried something new the second time,  (Eggs Benedict with home maid pulled pork, OMG it's my new favorite )  And guess what? they do one hell of a lunch, got a burger and took some home. yes that good and big, Wish they did dinner, I'd never eat at home again. The staff is great,  Ask for Rachelle and you'll love place even more ( so knowledgeable )  The manager comes around to see how your doing, that means a lot to me.  One suggestion: To The Oink Cafe, a loyalty type coupon/card or coupons for your next visit would be nice guys. Marketing 101, repeat customers will keep coming if you show them that they are valued.  I wish them good luck, and you'll probably see me there too",

    "text": "I went here today to try out the new local breakfast joint and just get something to go. I stood at the to go window for about 15 minutes before having to flag someone down to finally help me. I ordered the Maple bacon donut which they only had one left and it was kinda crumbled so the manager said I could have it for free which i thought was great and super nice of him but the waitress still charged me which, i wasn't going to haggle over it. So in regards to the service the manager was super nice and fantastic. The waitress left a lot to be desired but i won't hold that against the restaurant.   sooo, back to the food. the bacon maple donut is a cake donut with crunchy bacon sprinkled on top all glazed over. I thought it was good but not great. The donut seemed a little over cooked so u didn't get that soft middle but the taste was nice. a nice salty almost toffee like crunch from the bacon with a little bit of sweetness from the maple glaze. I could of used a little bit more sweetness at the tail end though.   I also ordered their bacon flight which comes with 8 different types of bacon including applewood, hone cured, jalapeno, peppered, sugar cured, hickory, apple cider, and pecanwood. The bacon left  a lot to be desired with only the peppered and jalapeno sticking out. Otherwise i wouldn't of been able to tell the others apart. I cleared my pallet after each piece to taste the different notes but they just weren't there. The bacon wasn't bad, don't get me wrong but it tasted like the bacon u would get at waffle house.   Overall I think a 3 out of 5 is pretty accurate. I like what there trying to do and I liked the manager but the execution is not there yet. We don't have many good local restaurants on this side of town so I really hope they can find a winning formula.",

So I totally pigged out. I figures, what the heck. New place? Let's go knee deep.   I had The Oink Omelette. I used to be a fat kid, so I felt my old self pop out.   Five eggs, with bacon, sausage, ham and cheddar cheese. With hash browns. How I didn't keel over with a heart attack, I don't know. In my defense! I didn't eat the whole thing!   But I did eat a lot. The servers here were so friendly! There was an older woman in particular who I noticed calling people by their names. She was very attentive with refilling coffee and water.   Next time, I think I'll try their jalapeno bacon.",

    "text": "With the slogan of \"breakfast, lunch, and bacon\", I would expect the restaurant to have multiple interesting and fun dishes with a focus on quality bacon. If this is what you are looking for, do not visit oink.   The service was ok, family run it seemed. A little disorganized, but it hasn't been open long so I'm sure that this will get better.  The food is standard breakfast and lunch. Most items do not include bacon as an ingredient and there are only 1-2 fun bacon dishes (such as bacon pancakes).  I ordered the French toast combo with honey cured bacon and hash browns. The French toast was ok, pretty typical. The hash browns were not fully cooked and the bacon was not very impressive and tasted like the cheap stuff you pick up at your local grocery store.  I strongly recommend that the owner check out some good bacon focused meat companies such as Broadbent, who has an amazing dry-cured bacon. If you like good bacon, join the zingerman's bacon club which will introduce you into several tasty varieties from across the country.  Oink should rethink its menu and name and try to bring the two in line with each other.   Good luck oink, the idea is great but execution needs a little work.",

Extremely long wait for food. 1 hour to be exact. 3 men came in and sat down beside us and it was obvious one of them had the hots for the waitress. They both flirted back and forth the entire time.  Amazingly they got their food in 10 minutes. After  I saw that I spoke up and asked \"what's is going on here\"? she said she they must know someone in the kitchen, haha. Needless to say that's all we needed to hear. Ba bye Oink, we won't be seeing you again.",

I met a client there one morning for breakfast and although the service was okay, the food was wonderful. I decided to go back the next day for breakfast again and try the French Toast this time. I went to the hostess stand and waited to be seated. I stood there and stood there. I even had a waitress that was standing by the bar doing nothing look right at me and look away. Finally, another waitress running food told her to seat me and she came over and did. I had the French Toast. It was terrific! I wish they had let the bread soak a little longer, but for the most part it was delicious!   I took my husband there the next Saturday and just more service problems. The waitress again was rough. My husband's omelet  was wonderful but the home fries were cold. You could tell they sat getting cold until the omelet was done. My French Toast was good, but really dry. Again they didn't let it soak long enough.   The concept is great and the food is terrific, but there is still some operational issue that need to be worked out. Better training of the waitresses or better waitresses. The kitchen seemed to struggle during the busy weekend compared as to when I was there during the weekday. I will go back as the food is really good and I hope that they mature!",

    "text": "A couple months back, a friend told us about this place. He raved about how delicious the bacon is. Being such obsessed fans of bacon we had to try it. The 30 minute drive there ended up being worth it.   We've been there twice now. Everything we've had there is really delicious. The big bacon omelette, the eggs benedict, the pancakes and even the bacon donut is to die for! You would think that with food quality this amazing, the service would be up to high standards, but I was let down.  The first time we went there, we had an excellent waitress. She was very sociable and definitely made our first visit there, one to remember. Our food came out in a blink of an eye and we just left there feeling this place couldn't go wrong. Today, it was entirely different. It took our waitress about 10-15 minutes to just grab our drink order. When we finally ordered, our drinks had ran and let me tell you, all we had was water. How hard is water to refill? Not that difficult. Our waitress paid more attention to a more larger group. Right before our food arrived, I ordered a mimosa. Let's just say that mimosa never arrived. She also ended up forgetting parts of my meal.   Even with this service, I would still go back. The food is too good to pass up forever I just hope that the service gets better. I know that people tend to forget, but when you're a waitress, it really isn't the best quality to have.",
