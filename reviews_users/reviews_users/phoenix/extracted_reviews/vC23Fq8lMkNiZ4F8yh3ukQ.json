And I thought it was so awesome that it was still open for those of us who despise going home right after seeing a movie.  The place is so chic, great ambiance, food and service.  It was kinda dead given it was a week day night, but still happening in a quiet sort of way. We ordered various sorts of mouth flavoring bites. Everything was MWAH! Pick something, anything.  You really can't go wrong! It's a good thing I was accompanied by sushi savvy people.",

After a show at the US Airways Center, walk down the road and have some quality sushi with some quality staff, jamming to quality old school pop music.  This place has plenty of attitude but also food to prove that they deserve to have more attitude.  Ask for Lisa when you are here.  She is great.  I promise to take piix next time, but, what you need to know is that thee hot saki is really good for being a house serving. They also keep you hydrated and wanting more and more fish.  Their seaweed salad is very good.  I had the volcano roll which was not very hot but you can ask for more heat.  The overall menu is satisfying.   I will be back.  A little earlier next time.",

When getting the Dragon Roll forget the flame effect the portion size was very lack luster. It had a slice of eel on top and only crab inside, I was disappointed in the texture and flavor choice. The worst Dragon Roll in all of Arizona or the US. I had another roll once again another roll with crab with horrible flavor and texture they need to remove these rolls from their menu or their imitation crab altogether. My wife got hand rolls, so small and cheap not worth the sticker price. Worst sushi place in Phoenix and worst food joint ever in my 15 years passing through Phoenix. Don't go.",

Our patient and friendly server readily answered all our questions and was very flexible about adding or removing items from our order, as we couldn't decide what to get. Landed on: poke salad, seaweed salad, a couple fried rolls, shishito peppers, chicken curry, and some cold rolls. As I mentioned, half the order was delicious like the peppers, poke salad, and cold rolls, and the other half was not 100% (dry curry, for example). Though this resto is not perfect, it hits the sushi spot when the craving strikes",

    "text": "Even if you're turned off by trendy sushi bars, Moira is worth a try. The menu is quite large and diverse, with some choices that are generally hit or miss.   The Geisha roll looked promising (lotus root? yum!), but I was so overwhelmed by the cream cheese I couldn't taste what looked to be a promising experience.  The Sakura roll really hit the spot. I have a weakness for unagi, and it did well with the snow crab and maguro. Also, the eel sauce had a nice kick to it, and is now my favorite. Some argue these rolls cost just a tad too much, but once you remember the quality of ingredients going in to every bite, I'd say it's just right.  But this sushi alone is far from mindblowing. If the review ended here, it would be a 3.5 rounded down to a solid 3 stars. Moira goes the extra mile by providing an exotic selection of cocktails and beers. There are a dozen or so lagers and stouts from the far east. I ordered the Singha Thai lager, and my comrades had some pretty interesting stouts from Japan. Most sushi bars will only carry Kirin Ichiban, Sapporo, and maybe Tsingtao, so the diversity is welcome. Also, the cocktails are worth a try. The list seemed to have run of the mill drinks, with a few exotic looking options. I can only compare it to Kabuki's drink menu, only with what I assume to be higher quality.  I'll be back for the happy hour, or to be more specific, the REVERSE Happy Hour featured here on Friday nights. It looks very promising, and I hope this place keeps living up to my four star endorsement.",

It was also my second time getting the fried noodle basket with shrimp - vastly different experience than the first time. It was not good - the shrimp tasted like dirt as if it wasn't washed.  Great sushi though. However, given the experience with waiter I will not repeat",

While I was delightfully surprised with the food (I can hardly believe I enjoyed sushi), our server was overbearing, literally standing over us while we ate, continuing conversation well past the acceptable level of small talk expected and even went to get his phone to unsolicitedly show us pictures he had taken since we had mentioned a mutual interest of photography in passing. While the conversation was \"good\", I did not come out to talk with the waiter while we ate and doing so made my girlfriend extremely uncomfortable. I'm a nice person and have a hard time with confrontation in situations like this, so maybe it's partially my own fault for entertaining the conversation and not saying something in the moment, but I still feel no one should be made to feel like they have to ask for privacy when they are paying customers out on the town with their significant other. This really should be common sense for wait staff and I wonder why management would allow their employees to attend to one table for over an hour while they ate without saying something about it. Something seems fishy, and it's not the sushi.",

I do like the atmosphere of the place.  It's dark, relaxing, and tucked far enough away off the beaten path that there's hardly any foot traffic going by outside.  If I go mid-week which is usually the case, I can find a corner table, open my laptop, and catch up on my email as I linger over dinner for an hour+.  Since they are not too busy when I go I don't feel bad about hogging a table.  The mussels are very good but there are only four to a serving for (I think) $8 (online menu does not show prices).  If you really like mussels go up the street to The District Restaurant in the Sheraton where you can get a seemingly endless bucket of mussels for $12.  I mean seriously, we're not talking lobster here.  These are mussels--the cockroaches of shellfish that cut up your feet at low-tide.  $8 for four of them is too much.  The roils are good, the sashimi is good, the waiters and waitresses are all very nice.  I will keep coming back but from now on I do my mussels elsewhere.",

We initially said table, but she was going to have to set it up before she sat us so we said bar. She then proceeded to have a conversation with her coworker. After a few minutes of standing there and watching this conversation continue another waitress stepped in to seat us. Unfortunately, the waitress having the conversation continued to be our waitress for the rest of the night. The food was good. The gentleman next to us also received a very small pour of wine and after 2 requests still did not receive ice water. He informed us he had been here a couple of times and the service was not good. It took awhile to receive my drink when there was only 1 other table seated aside from the gentleman next to us. It took awhile to have someone explain how to order food. The lady who actually seated us was amazing and every now and then checked in on us even though we clearly weren't her table. It took even longer for the check. Overall, if you don't mind the service it's a decent place to go for sushi.",

The menu is a tad short and a bit confusing at first, and having to request a sushi order paper so I can write my choices down is something I'm not use to. I may be back for some sake down the road but I'm aware of my expectations and those are so-so.

I totally know why this place was on the top 10 downtown dining review from Howard Steffel. On my last visit to Moira I had the Hamachi Cheek which was phenomenal. The head chef made me a cucumber roll that had everyone at my table wanting to to try it and they couldn't say enough about how flavorful the roll was. I also had the rainbow roll and the caterpillar roll which was a big success with my seven year old niece who is new to the sushi world also, I would like to add that both rolls were great. Moira also offers great bottled beverages my niece loved the japanese soda and I'm a big fan of the bottled teas they offer.  sexy, and fresh....Im completely loving Moira's decor its totally modern. and I can't help but address some complaning yelpers  If you want quality.... well, then you have to pay for quality:-) Unless, you go to happy hour then you get the deals. Moira's rolls are made with the freshest ingredients you can often run into the main chef picking up items from the locally grown markets in phoenix before and during his lunch hour to make sure he has the best product for his customers.   Also, the Harry Bertoia's Wire Chairs you guys talk so much of...I happen to love the art but  the word is they are redesigning a new pad for the bottom of the seat.  So all of you people that are rocking the caucausian long board and don't have enough cushion for the pushin are in luck. I just hope it doesn't ruin the look of moira's cool chairs.   With all that said I love moira and the great sushi chefs they always have me leaving with a smile:-)",

As we enter we were promptly greeted by our hostess and shown our seats but keep in mind, the place was about a quarter of the way full on a Saturday.    The ambiance of this the place is very cool and dark, kinda like The Roosevelt, with bar standing out with the bluish neon lights that were displaying the sharp angles and the reflective metals that weren't noticeable at first.  Our waitress was engaging and always at our attention.  She informed us that this spot is the neighborhood's little secret and mostly filled with locals.  She looked like a cut out from comic con and I know that could be a little stereotypical but I believe that it probably added to Moira's identity.  I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink so our waitress recommended the Hitachino Nest White Ale which was a great choice.  We order the Udon noodle soup and Vegas sushi.  The Udon noodle soup was good with Low Mein noodles and beefy broth but I believe that this bowl is reserved for vegetarians.  Now the Vegas sushi rolls, were just utterly amazing!  Served with sides of Wasabi and some shavings that have a citrusy taste and with that combination my tongue has been resurrected.  I couldn't believe that my tongue could experience such a degree of exhilaration.   I highly recommend Moira.  This place is adorable and the food is great with a decent price range compare with its local hotspot neighbors.  I can't believe that I was always passing by Moira without knowing what a jewel I had in my own neighborhood.  Moira will definitely be put in my weekly rotation of hangouts that I go to, see you there...  Note, this was my first time eating sushi and for me this is the standard.",

    "text": "My fiancee and I found this place on-line when we were looking fot sushi in the Central Phoenix area. Neither of us had heard of it but we decided to give it a go. We got there around 8:30 and the place was kindof empty so we were a little nervous. We walked in and were seated at a table by the window. We were seated with dinner menus but not a sushi menu. Ther server said they only give those out at the sushi bar. I thought that was a little wierd but the server was nice and the decor was hip and modern (it was metrosexual according to my fiancee) so we went with it.   We ordered lots and lots of sushi - ika salad, hamachi sashimi ($9), spicy tuna roll ($7), shrimp tempura roll ($7), and the sunshine roll ($11) (spicy salmon with lemon on top). We could not complain about anything! It was all very very good. It tasted fresh, yummy, and hit the spot. The total bill was $47.00 which sounded about right considering how much food we ordered!   We liked the decor, the service, and the food. I noticed they had a lunch menu so I will be taking my co-workers back with me next time!",

I must admit that I seldom venture outside of my norm due to distance, but this was well worth the drive. Everyone from our party really enjoyed themselves along with the Sake Bombers and the food.   Our waitress was prompt and very friendly. The setting was fantastic I really liked the layout. Moira is definitely a place I will return to. Thanks for making that night a great one Linda & Q!  For some reason I didn't snap any pictures of the food, but the next time I promise I will.",

One of our favorites was The Caterpillar which is not only cute but tasty. This place is not high end so don't feel you have to go black tie because to be honest the other guests were in shorts and flip flops. The bar is nice and long so there are many seats available if you prefer to sit there. The decor is just right for the location; it's not over the top but has a nice flair. The lighting to me was perfect as well as the restrooms being very clean. The sushi is priced just right for what you pay for. The only downside we found was the drinks are overpriced for this place, like we said there \"this is not Weho we are not paying $10 for a drop of vodka!\" Other than that I would recommend for other's to check it out, it's not the best, but it's good for what you receive.",

Moira is on the ground floor of a condo development in downtown Phoenix, easily walkable from other restaurants such as Pasta Bar and Roosevelt, and that itself is saying a lot.  A modern sushi place located in a condo building in downtown Phoenix speaks a great deal to the development of downtown, and I give kudos and an extra star to the owners of Moira for opening where they did.  That all said, Moira is an excellent on the sushi point too.  I had a Philly roll that had just the right combination of salmon and cream cheese (not too much cream cheese), a caterpillar roll with a great balance of color and flavor (and decorated, cutely, as a caterpillar) and a couple of nigiri with a very flavorful yellowtail and mackerel with an interesting sauce that complimented the fish.    I am hoping that this will soon transform from a place that you go to because you are downtown to a place people will go downtown for.  And it may - because it is quite good.  Well worth seeking out.",

    "text": "\"Meh, I've experienced better\" fits this place to a T.  On the bright side, it was cheap.  Happy hour specials are inexpensive, and you can do dinner and drinks for four for $60 or so.  The decor is warm, inviting and open, and it's exactly what downtown needed--a hip sushi place.  The staff's been really friendly on my two visits there.  That being said, the fish is decent and the rolls are mediocre-to-terrible.  I've gone twice needing a sushi fix and left not feeling satisfied.  And I've tried about half the rolls on the menu--from the uncomplicated California to the Vegas and Spider to a Volcano and some other stuff.  Most rolls were warm instead of the crisp cool I'm used to, and the flavors weren't distinctive.  I expect something in every sushi roll to give that roll a \"pop\" and it just doesn't happen at Moira--you feel like you're eating a warm Cuisinart mush-roll.  All four people at my table reached the same conclusion independently, and it wasn't groupthink, I swear.  I know this is a harsh review, but I'd like the see the place succeed.  For that to happen, they're going to have to either take more care with their ingredients and presentation or hire someone who REALLY knows their stuff.  I think I'll wait a few months for them to get it together before going back--rather not drive out of downtown for sushi but going to have to if I want my sushi itch properly scratched.",

I haven't had this roll before, and it was a perfect blend of fish and veggies all in one roll.  My gf's drink and roll were just okay, hence the 4 stars.  I was a bit surprised to see that the restaurant was only half full on a Saturday night (although there was a storm, so maybe people stayed home)...all in all a good experience.

At least I wasn't starving, I was just lacking good sushi when I walked out. And the service there is almost as bland as the food is.

I'm a bartender in the same district as this place at a highly-rated bar & restaurant, so I do know a few things about the service industry.   The hostess and two other servers didn't acknowledge myself and the individual with whom I arrived despite the three of them standing directly next to the host stand chatting.   The woman I assume was the hostess then returned to said stand, where she proceeded to shuffle papers around, stare at their dry-erase layout, and answer the phone. The other servers continued their conversation unbothered.   Not even a, \"hello, someone will be right with you.\"   After approximately three to five minutes another woman approached and sat us at the bar.   Fast forward another ten minutes and we had not been greeted or received waters, so we left.   There were no less than 6 - 8 open tables, and we saw many servers just standing around peering over their sections from around corners, or chatting with each other.   Everyone warned me against eating here due to the lack of service in particular, but I like to make up my own mind.   In this case, the warnings were not exaggerated.   The number of open tables at 8pm during a first Friday should have been a giant red flag but, alas, I prefer to give places the benefit of the doubt.   Stay away unless you have plenty of time to kill and zero service expectations.",

The sushi is affordable and the sake is delicious. They give you smaller cups for the beer, so you can actually enjoy multiple sake bombs with one order. If you go make sure to order the Dragon roll. It's not on the happy hour menu, but it's delicious. And the dragon breathes fire!  ;)",

There hasn't been a time where I come to Moira and had good service at all. Takes 10+ minutes to get just waters on the table every time. Food doesn't take long once we order, but last night we canceled the chicken wings we ordered for miso soup, then the waiter brings out some gyoza I didn't order and then continues to argue with me that I did order it. Told him to bring out the menu so I can show him what I ordered...never did. Ended up not even getting my volcano roll.   He came by to see how we were doing and didn't even pick up several empty plates on our table and the restaurant wasn't even busy it was 10pm at night during their happy hour.   When we got a 10 dollar check and it was wrong but we thought they discounted it because the service was so bad. We brought it up and nope! Brought out our real check with all the things we didn't even get on our table.   The manager didn't even come to us and apologize at all she just said \"is that them\" and gave us the updated check.   Don't think we will be coming back. Good luck.",

I would totally go here all the time for a tasty post-show/movie/date meal for the cost of Filiberto's if it weren't for the douchey vibe this place has.  Dark, with loud, bad music and stupid glowy lights.  It's not a good place if you want to actually have a conversation or see the people you're with.  I felt kind of embarassed to be there.

Today's  experience  put a stamp on it. We got to the restaurant  at 8:55 to order from the happy hour menu and throughout our meal the waiter addressed us and said well unfortunately  since you came at 8:55pm we can't honor the 9:30 happy hour. ... FIRST OFF THE HAPPY HOUR IS AT 9!!!!! they obviously need to review THEIR  OWN MENU and also their website!!!!!! long story short I was so surprised  because we have been going here for years! When we got the bill IT WAS ALL WRONG. I grabbed the happy hour menu to check the prices and everything was off $2-$3. So when I told our server he apologized, took our check and came back and said.. \"you guys were 5 minutes short of happy hour \"..... I could NOT BELIEVE IT.  What ever happened to customer service,  or should I say LOYAL customer service?.. I will NEVER  go back. THEY JUST LOST  LONG TERM CUSTOMERS .",

I was worried the tiny place wouldn't be able to accommodate a group of ten, but with no reservations, they were able to seat us almost immediately.   The ambiance was nice, somewhat more modern than what I like, but it was warm and cozy, and I thought it would be a great place to come back to when the nights are cooler and they have their doors open.  The food and service, though, was fantastic! I wasn't sure exactly what to get, but our group decided to order a bunch of stuff and share it.  Thinking back we should have ordered more because it was so good and I wanted more, but everything was delicious.  We didn't order anything too crazy -- mostly we order different types of rolls -- but each one was superb!   And, although I didn't participate in the sake bomb drinking, my other co-workers did and they said the drinks were great. Oh, and we were having so much fun, we decided to bet a co-worker to eat a huge dollop of Wasabi.  He was a sushi newbie, and really had no idea about the potency of the condiment.  I kept telling him not to do it, but after only $25 being put in the pot and our kind waiter bringing him a drink, he downed it all.  He was hurting for awhile, but hey, he got $25 from it.  All in all, Moira is a neat little gem of a sushi place downtown, and I'll definitely be coming back again for some yummy dishes and sake!",

    "text": "So my best friend wanted to take me here and I was kind of skeptic about it.. she thinks RA sushi is good and if you think RA is good, well I just feel bad for you...and your life (but not my best friends, love youuu). Anyways, upon entering Moira, I liked the decor, specifically the Buddha statue that is on the bar counter (right? Can't really remember haha). It took a bit of time for us to get our server, but in general, the service was a bit on the slow side. Except, our server was very friendly and knowledgeable that it made up for it.   Now for the sushi, we decided not to get any appetizers just in case we didn't have enough room left. I feel like when it comes to sushi, you buy too many sushi rolls and after you ate an appetizer it's kind of like .. ahhhhhh dammit! I AM SO FULL ALREADY..must eat....   So we got the summer roll, tiger roll, and the the fuji roll. I would have to say, I wasn't impressed, but I definitely wouldn't say that this sushi is 'horrible' like some people are saying. For the summer roll, it was pretty good I must say, but the avocado wasn't too fresh..and the rolls were pretty small. But I would have it again if I came here...maybe..haha.  The tiger roll was my favorite one, it had coconut shrimp on top of the roll, it was huge though, I had a tough time eating it but definitely yummy. Only issue with that was the fact that the sauce was VERY overpowering, there was way too much of it on there..and I mean, the sauce was good..but not that good. Lastly, the fuji roll, definitely the least favorite of the three, not too much flavor, but not bad either, nor do I really have anything to say about it.   Oh but there is one thing I DEFINITELY recommend, I am a huge whiskey drinker only..but I decided to venture off and try the \"Jaded\". Oh my goodness, I seriously felt like I was drinking a raspberry type smoothie drink, but it wasn't a smoothie, it was just an awesome alcoholic puree that I would drink all the time..and sadly, I got a buzz off it, or more so it just made me really tired (only on 3 hours of sleep, alcohol is a slap in the face). Anyways, try it!  All in all, this is a place to try, but ... don't except to be WOW'd . I would consider this over Kona Grill or RA sushi any day of my life. I just think the rolls are a little over priced for what they offer and in some cases, the flavor is either missing or just way too much. But still,  I would come again.",

Everything about this place was good.  Good ambience - felt young, hip, and fun.  Good drinks - I had sake bombers, but a couple of friends tried their cocktails and said they were good.  Good service - our waiter was awesome and worked really well with us.  And all agreed, good food.  I am a vegetarian, so I had the rainforest rolls.  They were so good, I had to get another order.  Someone made the comment that they're not cheap, but there are a lot of them, and that's right on track.  A couple of people got their dishes this well.  Everyone was happy, everything was great.

After some welcome air-conditioning and ice water, I ordered up some seaweed salad, hamachi, and just for kicks, the quail eggs. All were delicious, refreshing, served with a smile, and for reasonable prices.  It's so nice to know that a great lunch can be had so close to work.

    "text": "This was an interesting experience. The sushi was very good especially for Phoenix where \"fresh\" fish is extremely hard to come by. The atmosphere and decor is great but I went there for lunch on a weekday and the time it took to get the food left something to be desired to get back to work on time. In addition it is July in Phoenix but they had the door propped open when its well over 100, huh?  The edamame was good but could use more salt throughout rather than just a sprinkle on top and of course it is hard to mess up edamame.  The tempura vegetables were battered well and the sauce had just the right hint of spice which was amazing. However, the vegetables that were used were ehhh and they were cooked in clumps together so you couldn't pick the veggies you really like without getting a mouth full of veggies you can do without. Now for the sushi. The spicy tuna roll was oh so good!  Just based on the sushi alone, I will go to Moira again and I recommend it to those looking for well done seemingly fresh sushi  but not when I have a time constraint like lunch on a weekday.",

The calamari ended up soggy; their spider roll was bland. A friend had the surf and turf roll, which tasted like someone wrapped bland steak around a bland ball of rice.   My server was also forgetful; I ordered a drink, which he didn't remember until the check arrived. He was friendly and talked to us a lot, but still.. he failed at his main job, which was to provide table service.   And lastly, I couldn't enjoy even being at the restaurant (even though i did appreciate the decor and general cool vibe) because the chairs HURT SO MUCH. I wore a skirt, and about 25 minutes into the meal, the back of my legs looked like I had a crossword puzzle imprinted. I felt like I was sitting on a wire spatula. Everyone else in my group also complained about how uncomfortable they were during dinner.   So I'm sorry, Moira, I really like your vibe and your location, and I love the building you're in, but I'm just not that into you.  At all.",

When walking into this place, you forget that you're in Phoenix.. I felt like I was in Los Angeles and one of their trendy spots.  We are there right as they open and are quickly seated.  The waiter takes our drink orders and since it's happy hour, we decide on some food and drinks.    I dont recall the name of the dish, but the waiter sells us on their special and damn was it good.  It was spicy, something.. that's all I remember.  This is what ya get for writing a review so late.   Being a new sushi lover of only six months, I try to taste all that I can and there wasnt a thing we tried that wasnt good.  Just a great place.    I did notice that everyone who came in were women and blonde.. was there a convention in town?  I look forward to my next venture at this restaurant.",

    "text": "First off you must consume enough sake and beer to warrant a visit to the restroom. That way you can pass through the sexy, cold, metal chains dangling in the hallway door. Reminded me of the beads I had in my bedroom in 5th grade. Yep. Beads. Don't judge. It was the 70s you know!? And the restrooms themselves were fabulous as well. But this isn't a site on reviewing johns so let's get to the good stuff.   Immediate greeting. Quick seating. And minutes later...lots of EATING! The gyoza was orgasmic. Thin, crunchy with shrimp and veggies! The mussel appetizer was good, not great, but creamy and hot. Reminds me of Taylor Lautner...muscles, creamy...well you get the picture. We dove into the sushi; tuna, yellowtail, freshwater eel...you know, the standards. All delicious...yellowtail being the best.   The rolls, though I don't remember any names were all very good. One in particular was made with soy paper? Is that right? Soy paper? It was a nice break from the seaweed. Soy paper?   We spent about $50 a person...worth every penny. The vibe inside on a Monday night was pretty happening I must say. Sexy lighting and great tables along the window. Our server, complete with a big poofy mohawk was fantastic! Wasn't crazy about the chairs. What? Did they recycle some shopping carts?  Moira! I want moira you!",

    "text": "Wow... I haven't been to this place in a year.  There's a reason.  When Moira first opened, I waited a few weeks then went down there to check it out.  The sushi wasn't bad.  It was actually okay.   The reason I think it was even okay was because, like many others... I WANT to like it.  I've lived downtown for 15+ years and we're starving for an outstanding sushi spot... okay... even a \"decent\" sushi spot.  It didn't happen with Moira.  The first few times I went there... the food wasn't too shabby... but then... OOPS... not so good.  I've now gone there a couple of times and received FOUL sushi.  I'm not joking.  The icing on the cake was the last time my bf and I went there and the tuna sashimi was served to us in a VERY LARGE portion.  We were both excited... at first.  Then quickly realized that the fish was definitely past its expiration.  UGH... the smell was SO BAD.  When we alerted the server of this they told us that they'd see if they could take it off the bill.  Uh... we were NOT about to pay for this foul smelling tuna.  I mean who in their right mind would eat this?  In the end, they agreed to not have us pay for that dish.  What I thought was pretty screwed up was that they served this to us thinking that we were idiots and some stinky tuna would just fly under the radar.  NOPE!  Btw, the above experience isn't the only one.  I had a previously bad experience on NYE 2 years ago... and should have not gone back... but I chalked it up as one bad incident and thought I'd be open minded, since I really wanted to like it.  The only thing I could say positively about the place was that the sake menu was pretty good.  But to be honest with you... great sake is only a few steps away at Sens... along with some really tasty eats.  I truly want to have a great sushi place downtown here... why can't we get it?  I'm willing to pay a good price for exceptional food.  When will that exceptional sushi spot come to downtown PHOENIX?!",

THEN...  Oh yes,  then he makes threatening remarks to my fiance for asking \"what kind of restaurant closes their kitchen an hour before closing time?\" and justifies them by saying he works in a law firm during the day and can get away with it.  Unbelievable. I've lived down the street for 6 years and had never gone to your restaurant due to the reviews I'd heard from friends about the additude of your staff. I wouldn't have gone at all if not for my fiance wanting to so bad. I guess that makes two more on the list of people who won't ever be coming back.",

The sushi roll we tired was small for the moolah $15 & not great. Good mind you but not great. We'll be back for the DJ, happy hour specials, good service & ambiance.

I do have some pretty big gripes about the place though. It is hotter than hell every time I have eaten there, regardless of the season. It also doesn't matter what part of the room you are in.  The customer service is lacking. The waiter we had was very inattentive despite the fact there was only one other table in the place.  Lastly - $2 for 8oz of Coke? Never again.

Uncomfortable chairs, even with the pads, my back was killing me.  The waitress said the fresh wasabi was free, until the check came. Overpriced.    For a place in this price range, I expect way less cons.   Why I gave 2 stars: the waitress decided that we didn't tip her enough, so she doubled it. What happened was we had a $100 meal, and split the check. My friend put the tip ($25 = 25%) on his card. Later that month we were looking at our credit card bills, and we were both charged $75 dollars. Thats a $50 tip on a $100 meal. My calls to the management remain unreturned after a month.

One huge positive here is that they do a Saturday reverse happy hour after 9pm so I brought a group of 6 in for drinks and snacks. The service itself was pretty good and our server was SUPER-SWEET AND COOL and but the food was disappointing. I ordered the volcano roll which had a mushy texture and a rather unpleasant flavor overall. I tasted the spicy tuna and did not care for it. My plum wine was nice and I enjoyed the fried chicken wings on the happy hour menu, but it was INCREDIBLY loud. They had a DJ spinning which was a nice touch but it was so damn loud (uncomfortably so) that I could barely hear my dining companions or the server.   I MIGHT be apt to try it again because it is a really lovely little joint and the happy hour prices are fantastic.  In the meantime, however, 2 stars.",

I looked at their hours and was very surprised to see how late they are open, I've noticed many restaurants around here close around 10 or 11 so it is a great option to have late at night.",

I tried a version of a kentucky smash and it was so sweet it was undrinkable. Our waitress replaced it with another drink, a coconut lemon grass one and that one was unfortunately just as sweet.

The only gripe that I have was the Japanese fried rice, I ordered it with shrimp and wasn't particularly fond of tails being left on. Any who, the two sushi rolls I ordered were excellent and spicy--the way I like it--and the Lux cocktail was delicious with the right amount of oomph.

We had a cool appetizer where you cooked your own beef on a hot stone, but the amount of food you get for the price you pay isn't ideal.  Still, it's a prime area of town at a classy joint, so you're probably paying some for ambiance.    Decent food for a somewhat expensive price.",

Our waiter was nice and comped our bottle of wine for the mishap. It's sad to see a place that once had great service and promptness go so down hill. The place has a great  happy hour, location, and atmosphere, but I feel as if the owner is absent and is letting the restaurant  go. I don't think I will be going back.",

First of all, the sodas that we were charged $3.50 for were flat. When we asked if there were other sodas available since our Cokes were flat, we were told that they all came from the same machine and that they were waiting on a shipment of CO2. It would have been nice when we ordered sodas for him to have told us they were flat if they knew their machine was out of CO2. Everything just seemed a bit dirty and rundown. When the food came, there was a bug in the soy sauce when we poured it out of the jar. It is a shame, because it used to be a great place. I don't know if they are just struggling and cutting corners or what. But our VERY underwhelming lunch and sodas cost us almost $60, which was insane! Hopefully they can fix their issues!",

I was a tad skeptical of the better reviews of Moira, but decided to give it a try, especially since it's in one of my favorite mixed use buildings in downtown Phoenix.  And  I'm glad I did.  From the decor, to the service and most importantly, the quality of the food Moira is a great addition to the downtown scene.  Hana may be a bit more 'traditional' in its approach to sushi, but it holds nothing on Moira in terms of freshness, quality or creativity.   While it isn't the best sushi that I've ever had (need to travel to Vancouver for that) it is the best I've had in Phoenix.   Fresh products prepared with attention and creativity.  The tempura is great, light batted and cooked to let the vegetables stand out, and reflects what is being done in Vancouver, Tokyo, NYC, Hong Kong and other sushi mecca's. Also they have a nice beer selection, including a few from Japanese micro-brewery Hitachino Nest, which makes for a refreshing change from the (Budweser equivalent) Sapparo and Asahi that most Japanese restaurants serve.   A bit of advice for those contemplating ordering sashimi or nigri -- always ask the sushi chef (and not the wait staff) what they recommend that evening -- sushi restaurants are at the mercy of their suppliers in terms of the quality of the daily deliveries,  and the toro that tasted divine last week, may not make the 'cut' this week.",

It's cool, high energy, and widely diverse.  The food is fresh and  contemporary and the service blew me away.  We ate a variety of sashimi and about 5 different kinds of rolls.  Don't leave here without having the Rising Sun and the Fuji rolls (ask for extra sauce and sprinkles on the latter).   Great quality seafood and uber fresh veggies, beautifully executed.  (I would like to have seen a little more proficiency with the slicing of the tako, but it's kind of  a beast to master and this is such a small thing...)  Moira also has the real deal fresh wasabi for only $2, SO worth it for a huge pile of fresh, green goodness.    Moira has a great list of specialty cocktails and a knock-out sake list with excellent prices.    All of the servers I saw seemed amazing, but we had the pleasure of being served by Mattie, who was just the best, honestly.  I was very happy to see a big crowd on a Thursday night, and they have kick-ass happy hour deals through the week and reverse happy hour on the weekend.  Ask about the specials too, they sounded awesome although we didn't try them.  I honestly don't have a bad thing to say about Moira Sushi.  I fear we'll go broke now that we found Moira, but it will be a great way to go!",

I am a fan of all things cucumber.  Dark, intimate atmosphere, great for small or large groups.",

I will let you all be surprised but please be sure to include this hidden gem in your line up when visiting downtown or if you live downtown like I do then why haven't you been here already - just like I've been asking myself for nearly a year.  Good eats await you!!!! I loved it all, especially the eel.",

Maybe we were taking our time a little too much for her liking?  The food was just okay. We ordered sashimi - hamachi yellowtail, saba mackarel, maguro tuna. The tuna and yellowtail tasted okay but nothing spectacular. The mackarel was awful! It honestly tasted like I'd cracked open a jar of herring! I'm pretty sure this isn't the flavor it's supposed to have or at least I hope not. I've had mackerel before and it didn't taste anything like what I experienced at Moira. It also seemed as though they were rationing the wasabi portions - we asked for more wasabi twice! We also had the seaweed salad and tuna poke which was pretty good.   I guess I had high hopes for this place and it didn't  exactly deliver. I think I'll stick to Sakana or Hiro.",

I really loved the veggie roll, which came with mini lotus roots, that I loved of course. Also, the lychee infused vodka drink was amazing and strong. Lovely. Angie C. and I also enjoyed the fried tofu, which had zucchini and other surprises actually inside the blocks of tofu. We will be back, it's a great location downtown, and the area is usually nice and quite.  Places like this are essential if Phoenix wants to be taken seriously, and I think Phoenix does.",

Even the hostess was surprised when we told her we read the Yelp reviews before our visit.    What a fun place!  We went about 6pm on weekday and there was plenty of happy hour left for us.  And great prices too.  We had a Volcano & Vegas rolls which we really liked.  Then we tried the edamame shui mai.  If you go, please try these as you won't be disappointed.  The dipping sauce was sesame / mango.  We also had the Orange Blossom, Sun Kiss and 22oz Asahi bomber.  No way can you beat the happy hour prices for this sushi.  We enjoyed our table.  The metal chairs reminded me of the long forgotten Miracle Mile Deli.  Great energy in this place.  Can't wait to visit to try more of the menu.",

Chairs looked like recycled shopping carts. Weren't really that comfortable. But coming from a man with no ass, take that tidbit with a grain of salt.   The drink menu was pleasant with plenty of handcrafted cocktails, including one whole page of drinks made with cucumber. They also sport delicious Asian beers and an array of China Mist Bottled Iced Tea.   The food was pretty good. My date and I shared a selection of one of their house signature rolls, a \"Sakura\" which is unagi, snow crab, maguro, avocado rolled in soy paper. Also had the daily special which was a delicious roll of crab, cucumber, avocado, topped with seared beef and a spiced mayo. We threw in some Yellowtail Nigiri and a spider roll to round it out.  The food was delicious and approachable It was visually appealing as well.   Service was pleasant and quick to clear the small plates out of the way that sometimes clutter a table.   I'd recommend this place to all in the downtown area. A pleasant surprise.",

    "text": "At 8pm on a Friday night, Moira was shockingly quiet, only 4-5 tables filled in the restaurant. it suited us perfectly though. We sat at the sushi bar and were immediately attended to by a waiter and one of the chefs. Definite props on the service, they were attentive and helpful.   I was pretty excited to hear they had kona kampachi, so we started with two pieces of the kona, tuna sashimi and a shrimp tempura roll. The roll was fine, the tuna looked great, but it had that slightly chewy fat line in it (I really hate that... so disappointing) but the kona kampachi nigiri was so good we immediately ordered a sashimi plate of it. Really outstanding and generously sized pieces of it too. We followed that up with unagi nigiri which was fantastic.  Overall, I thought the sushi was very good - other than the tuna everything was spot-on how it's supposed to be.  I really didn't think the prices were unreasonable (you want some sushi that isn't worth the prices, go to Pure in old town... oy vey), and the portions looked perfect to me. I really really hope that the tuna is better next time I go, though :(   Since a few people mentioned the chairs, I'll give you my opinion on them...  Since we were at the sushi bar, we were on barstools. Once I was up on the chair I was very comfortable... it was just the getting up onto it, and off of it, IN A SKIRT, after a sake bomber, that was difficult :) You'll see what I mean if you go!  Note: I was disappointed that my usual Kirin was not available, but just had an Asahi instead... they had many asian beers I wasn't familiar with, maybe next time I'll be adventurous and try one of them....",

    "text": "First time at Moira last night.  I normally don't go for sushi, but it was my boyfriend's birthday and he was in the mood for sushi.  I think that the decor of the place is decent.  The LED lights under the bar are a little weird, but unless you look directly at them not really that noticeable.  The chairs are uncomfortable.  No matter how you shift, one of the bars of the metal grate that forms the chairs digs in to your flesh.    The service was ok.  The server was very nice, but everything took FOREVER even though it was fairly empty.  They also forgot to bring my food with everyone else's (actually, forgot to make it) - cut to me eating my food after everyone was done.  I will say that they tried to make sure we enjoyed the experience - we didn't really like the shochu infusion (sugar cane) they brought, so they swapped it out for us and brought a cocktail, the Tokyo Glow, which was actually pretty delicious.    The food is what saved the restaurant from a lower rating for me.  I don't really like sushi, so I can't comment on the sushi.  But the plate that I ordered from hot kitchen, the pho crunch, was absolutely delicious.  I would go back just to eat it again.  I may re-review the restaurant in the future, as the service issues were not attitude issues, just mistakes that could have been the result of an off night.",

This place is a great stop if you live in the downtown area, since you don't have to worry about parking.  The rolls werent as jam packed with sushi as I am used to.. but still had decent flavor.  I ordered the sunshine roll which includes: spicy salmon, cucumber, topped w/ fresh salmon & lemon slices. I just wish the slices of salmon were thicker.  honestly, Pure in scottsdale/phoenix area is better. Sorry Dave.  EXCEPT! The more sake bombs you take, the better your experience is!

Happy hour is Monday  through Thursday 5pm till close I believe which is really good I believe they just changed it! Happy hour menu is awesome, you have many options to choose from!

If you have kids, DON'T bring them here!  Definitely not a great place to take your kids to.  We came here right when they opened, didn't know what the setup was, and my toddler got her drink in a glass hard liquor-type cup.  The waitress was totally cool about it and we lucked out in that the kiddo was in a good mood that day and of course we came during broad daylight and not the evening happy hour crowd!  Great decor.  Very shiek.  The teenager that came with me loved it and loved the lighting.  Overall, we had a great experience.",

They were basically, four rolls, filled with seaweed and avocado in a salmon cannoli. Who knew!?  -Jade roll: Was outstanding! I wanted to order another tray of it!  -We also had the fresh tuna and the ahi tuna sashimi that were served with fresh wasabi. To die for!!  My concerns: although it was our first time, the server failed to explain the menu when we first walked in. He was rather friendly, but I was displeased with his lack of  professionalism and the service was slow; although, there was no one there but us and another couple on a Friday night.   We would go back again, but we would make sure that our cocktails weren't watered down and didn't take that long to prep the next time.",

We were seated at the low spot of the sushi bar my last visit, and the counter sat right at chest level. It was nearly impossible to comfortably eat that way. We moved to another area of the sushi bar at regular height- it was much better, but the chairs are heavy and made of metal- it was very hard scooting in and out- also the curve a little on the edges like a bowl- I was wearing a dress and it was challenging getting out of my seat and still staying lady-like.   The look of the place is cool, but those chairs are not functional- nor is that short spot at the bar- terrible idea.  Eat at a table and you will be ok.",

The staff insisted we are welcome and proceeded to wait on us.   We ordered quickly, and ate equally as fast but the guys working there continued to clean up around us (which is fine) and dim the lights. I felt like this was a signal to get out which - I get, but it wasn't even 11 (closing time) RUDE!  The music was blaring and at first it was okay (Drum and Bass) but then it kept going with high pitched Skrillex style EDM and was killing the vibe. I guess I should have asked them to change it, but come on man . . .",

None the less we ordered, I stuck with a GF bowl, because yes they have a little leaf symbol thingie next to the entree to let you know what's vegetarian, GF and something else I can't think of right now. I also ordered a spicy tuna hand roll.  Picked up our order and could hardly wait to get into it. Oh my sweet baby Jesus, it was all so delicious!! Let me rewind....when I arrived to pay for our orders the girl upfront ensured me that my order was GF and if it was for dietary needs. While odd I'm used to those questions and happily answered YES!  This is definitely one of the lunch places I always go back to and have even tried the GF sushi burritos, oh my goodness they're all so delicious    Happy I found Moira",

    "text": "My friend and I found this sushi restaurant while being stood-up by Meet-up friends at Cobra Arcade (review of that to follow). We walked across the street from Cobra and decided to eat at Moira Sushi. The place is plotted on the skinny side of a building and has small to moderate seating available. You could not take large parties here, but it was perfect for the two of us wanting to sit at the counter. The only downside to Moira is the service. They are extremely helpful and courteous, but took us about 10 minutes to get a menu... another 5 to get water.  The food is what holds the rating up!! We gave our sushi slip to the chefs and immediately, food starting coming out. I think it might be better to ask what order we would like the food out. We received the appetizers AFTER our food. I like that balance where the appetizers come, and you have enough time to eat prior to the main course. Needless to say, everything pretty much came to us at once and our area was CROWDED. Again, service is not that great, and empty plates just sat there. They were still there when we left.  The over-abundance of plates were an issue since my friend and I wanted to sample pretty much everything. Having to stack up our own plates is not a good experience.  The food: The food is extraordinary. Spicy tuna was rolled nicely with the rice not being too overbearing. The Spicy Lobster was not our jam today, but it was worth a shot, not the chef's fault. The Hamichi Toro... OMG, simply fantastic. The Blue Fin Tuna was so great, we had to order another so we wouldn't fight over the last piece. The calamari looked and tasted amazing and the Spicy Garlic edamame went really quickly. Overall, this place is dynamite. With a more attentive waitstaff, this place would be the rage. We were there at 7:00 and stayed there till 8:30-ish, and MAYBE there were two other couples in the restaurant. I would imagine that with a attentive wait staff, this place should be crawling!!! I made the trek from Ahwatukee and will continue doing so because of the food, and I implore everyone to try Moira for their sensational sushi... just don't expect service to be quick.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner last night with a few other people since it was decently close to Symphony Hall, and my experience was overall pretty average (3-3.5/5). I shared the Crackling Calamari and Sensei Roll with my sister. The Crackling Calamari tasted good, but it was spicier than expected, and a good portion of the plate was filled with veggies; there were also two minor things that miffed me: 1) because of the name, I had expected the calamari to be really crispy-crunchy, but it was just the standard chewy texture, and 2) despite the veggie mix, my plate had a ton of cabbage and peppers but not a lot of other stuff. The Sensei Roll, on the other hand, was actually super interesting! It was like a surf and turf, east meets west kind of experience with the lobster, beef, avocado, spicy mayo, and avocado. The first taste was pretty odd, but it got better the more I ate. I did try a few other things around the table, namely the Sichuan Garlic Edamame and Karaage. The edamame was no joke it was flavorful, but so spicy that it actually stung my skin when some of the sauce got on my arm! The kaarage and its sauce had very subtle flavoring, though. Moving on, the decor was pretty cool with strong, artful Japanese vibes, but it's rather dark inside. I didn't go to the restroom there, but I heard from some other people that the general vibe of its location seemed really shady and scary? Anyway, the service was actually spot-on when we had first arrived, but after receiving our food, it slowed down tremendously. We couldn't even find our waitress for like ten minutes and had to wait for our bills for another fifteen or so.  I would probably try this place again (ordering different foods) if I were in the area, but it's a pretty standard Japanese restaurant overall, so I wouldn't necessarily say it's somewhere you have to go out of your way to visit.",

One of my friends dropped 108 (just food!)  Another downside is the parking. There's a public lot one block away. Add 5 dollars.  It's a cool place to hang out if you don't mind overpriced mediocre food.   The service was also pretty bad. It seems that either they were understaffed or just didn't care much.  PS They bathrooms are pretty interesting and with cool design elements but the walls are covered with FRP which make them look super awkward/cheap.",

I also ended up going back for dinner the very next day.  I liked Moira after I had we had a chance to warm up to each other and get over the awkward first meeting where I expected the door to go the other direction... wayfinding people.. I'm telling you.. even buildings could benefit from great user experience design.  My service both times has been the pace I needed - the first time it was slow so I could just relax, enjoy the atmosphere, and not get to my next meeting too early. The second I had like a half hour and our server was once again on top of the ball and got us out and to the Herberger in just the right amount of time.  The sushi... delicious. I've had a few different rolls and some nigiri as well. The only one I didn't really care for was the yellowtail. My favorite was the ebi nigiri. :) The scallop appetizer was delicious, and Moira gets their spicy rating right. The thai chili on top was just that.   Given the choice, I will probably choose the bar over a table as it seems they just stuff people in the back of the place and move their way forward, and I wasn't really digging that. I loved the bar and talking with the chefs while I was eating. While sitting at the bar the first time, I even got to watch a lemon juggling act while eating my mochi.. which was DELICIOUS btw.   I don't live nearby... yet... but with pretty decent prices, this will be my sushi stop when I hit the craving while downtown.  Bonus was the server gave me mad props on my phone wallpaper which is rambo shooting weapons while on a unicorn. I like his style!",

It's a small, trendy and hip establishment, seemingly in the middle of nowhere. The restaurant is dim lit, with blue lighting along the bar area.  The drink menu was definitely interesting. There were none of your basic go-to's, and a lot of Japanese inspired drinks, which was fun. The cocktails also had strange infusions, like sweet potato. The beers ranged for the Lucky Buddha (super cool bottle) to sake and sake bombs.   I am nearly a vegetarian, so I ordered the sichuan garlic edamame to start. It was absolutely delicious; the best edamame I have ever had! Be sure to try this!  For the sushi, I split the rainforest (veggie) and the zero sen (veggie) rolls with a friend. Both were delicious.  I would recommend this place to others in the area.",

The sake bombers are tops, although I'd like it to be served in a larger glass. Wait, what's that? You get buzzed faster with a the smaller glass?? You don't say. Nevermind; scratch that.  The sushi is good, but I'm up for sushi pretty much any time. While it's not the best in the world, it's leaps and bounds from the worst. Doesn't really sound like a compliment when it's put that way, but seriously, Moira is good, 4-star sushi for downtown Phoenix.  Factor in the Asian Mario Lopez and you have a 5-star deal. :swoon:",

I feel like that sushi would taste like Moira sushi.   The fish here is not fresh. That's really about it. They can have the most clever fusion ideas, 'cool' decor, a rad happy hour menu, but the fish tastes minutes away from expiration. There's no excuse for this. I've come here twice: once when they very first opened, and again very recently. Both times the fish was disturbingly fishy.   Also, their soy sauce is not a good quality one. Extremely salty and concentrated. I had to add water to it. (and I LOVE salt)",

    "text": "I finally got to try Moira yesterday, which I found via Yelp, and which I had bookmarked for months.  I work in downtown Phx and really wanted to like it.  The decor is pretty, and the building it's housed in is pretty awesome, but that's about as far as the positives go.  Let me say first that the sushi isn't \"AWFUL\"..... but it's not \"good\" either.  It's meh.  And it's definitely overpriced for \"meh.\"  (Compared to most places in Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tempe, it's at least $1 more per item.)  I will say that the spicy tuna wasn't even remotely spicy.  What sucks:  the service.  I went with a coworker for lunch, and we were not greeted, nor were we seated.  We finally went to the bar, where a server came up to us after 10 minutes, only to tell us that she would be right back.  The place was NOT busy at all.  The server came back, took our drink orders, dropped them off, and that was it.  We didn't see her for the rest of the meal and had to flag her down to get our check.  I asked the sushi chef about lotus-- I wanted to know if it had a strong flavor.  He thought about it for a minute and then said \"not really.\"  How about \"NOT AT ALL.\"  Which is fine-- they basically just use it for crunchy texture.  It just struck me as odd that this wasn't his immediate response.  Normally I wouldn't mention the chairs, but I have read other Yelp reviews and they are right-- they are the most uncomfortable chairs that my butt has graced in a long time.  Bottom line is that if you are in downtown Phx and want reasonably good sushi for a good price, go to Ichi-Ban on Central and Thomas.  The decor isn't as hip, but the food and service are FAR better.",

I'm not a big tofu fan, but it was surprisingly delicious!  It ended up being happy hour by the time we were ready to order, and we couldn't pass up the happy hour deals ($5-$7 rolls), so we mainly stuck to the happy hour menu. We ordered 5 rolls from the happy hour menu: spicy tuna, vegas, sakura, volcano, (I can't remember the 5th one). They were all delicious, but we all liked the volcano roll the best. That was until we decided to splurge on the jade roll... amazing! For 6 rolls and an appetizer, the bill was only $50!    The service was as great as the food. Our waitress made great recommendations, and our food came out quickly. My only complaint was the music was a bit too loud and made conversation hard.

    "text": "There is certainly a dearth of sushi places in Downtown Phoenix.  I had to find a lunch place in a confined radius, and I wanted sushi, so this is the most promising place I came up with.  Let me start by saying the atmosphere is excellent.  It has a very trendy, upscale vibe to it.  The place bleeds gentrification.  They clearly put a lot of effort into the decor.  The service was also good, and I was surprised at the server's ability to memorize my order of two rolls, a sashimi, and several nigiri.  As a restaurant, this place is really not bad.  As a sushi bar, however, this place needs some work.  The first thing you'll notice is how incredibly limited their selection is.  I was really disappointed they don't have uni, and there were a few other glaring omissions (no red snapper, striped bass, etc.).  Clearly, they are not trying to appeal to those who are serious about sushi.  They did have a couple extra varieties of tuna in, that weren't on the menu, so that was nice.  About half way through the meal, I noticed that I didn't have any miso soup.  Of course I didn't order any, but I guess I just assumed that when you order sushi, they just give you a bowl of miso soup.  With how much they charge there ($75 for a light meal for two people, including tip), you'd think they could just throw in a small bowl of cheap soup, right?  The rolls were OK, I guess.  Nothing special.  The fish tasted fresh enough, no complaints there.  This place is definitely more about presentation than sushi, and apparently presentation costs a lot.",

They have lots of tasty options like calamari and seaweed salad and other good stuff. The atmosphere is cool and trendy but the service is a little slow.  Why I warn about the happy hour is the sake bombers. I'll say it again, HOLY CRAP. I think I only had two, plus a few beers but after a couple hours I was more intoxicated that I have been for a LONG time. Apparently at the next bar I went to, I was calling everyone \"Babe\" and I think the bar manager was worried I was going to get out of control...needless to say a cab ride was in my near future.   I will be back for more happy hour goodness but perhaps I should send out a warning in advance because I may just get crazy...again,",

He also forgot to bring our edamame out till after our food and didn't offer to take it off. He actually forgot a few things. It was just a bad night here.

    "text": "DOWNTOWN. LATE NIGHT.   This place has been a gem since day one. Offering up the Valley's best sushi (I've yet to chowed on better), BEST PRICE GUARANTEED.   This place is certainly boutique, not a chain at all. So what does that mean? Well, the owner/founder/head chef will probably be personally handling your fish - Tony is a maestro in every way, cultured in the East, a fisherman by trade, can literally HANDLE a fish and judge the grade/quality of the cut. You are keeping your money local in every sense - keeping it DOWNTOWN. Sure, the place can some times get slammed. It happens. Downtown is erratic and will be dead one night, pary-vanned the next. The staff is consistent and menu-familiar, no turnover and noobs to worry about here.   Ask for something off menu or for Tony to freestyle something for you. A couple of ex-Suns (I won't name drop) would frequent this place all of the time (a certain Mercury star too) and get something 'Chef's Pick' and the presentations were just exquisite.   Try their SERIOUS COLD sake collection - if you ask for hot, jab your chopsticks in your ears and march your a$s over to Pei Wei --- because you shouldn't be doing sushi. The nigori's are phenomenal.   And if you're a True resident to d-town Phx, go in for lunch. Amazing value, well rounded between soup, salad, a roll, and nigiri. If I can remember it was like $9.   Lastly: I've seen a couple of Yelpers commenting how \"Expensive\" Moira is. I have to smack my head and ask WTF are you talking about? $10 for a premium roll? Go to Roku and check their menu. Go ANYWHERE else (Stingray at the Biltmore, etc) and check their menu! What are you paying?? Where are you eating? This place is COST CONSIDERATE in every way on the soosh front. I've seen $20+ rolls in Scottsdale and the like - and don't bother asking the fish vendor they get their stuff trucked in with (cough, suspect).   Okay, I'm out. Dine on!",

I was kind of annoyed because we called them from a different bar to ask if they would put our name on the wait list and they said they only do that for parties of 6 or more. It turned out alright because the wait wasn't terribly long. Again, this bar was ok, but nothing special. I got the 'jaded' drink and it tasted almost chemically. Not my favorite. I tried their shrimp roll, and wasn't a fan (but I don't like shrimp, so it really isn't fair). I still think their stuff is overpriced and only fair.",

That comes courtesy of Moira Sushi in downtown Phoenix, a hip little spot with a sushi bar and an array of other Japanese specialties, including shrimp tempura and edamame.  Moira has some of the best miso soup ($6) I've ever had, and this time, I also tried their seaweed salad ($5). I wasn't as big of a fan of this-it was really soggy, not crunchy like I like it, and I had to add some dressing to give it more flavor. It's an extremely  filling appetizer, though.  For the main course, I like the generously portioned vegetarian roll ($7)-and my sushi chef even hooked me up with extra avocado!  The atmosphere at Moira is cool-dim blue lighting and candles. The wire chairs are pretty uncomfortable, and in such a pretty setting, I wish they were more cushioned.",

    "text": "Moira has grown on me. They aren't my favorite sushi in the the Valley, but they certainly try to be! Their location is much welcome in the Downtown Phx area.  Now, I am a sushi snob, so I don't think they have the freshest cuts or the most creative menu. I do think that if you're downtown and craving sushi, (especially late night) they get the job done.  If you want a really good bargain, hit their happy hour and reverse happy hour. You can eat a ton of sushi on the cheap and go home satisfied.  If you're there for happy hour, try the White Blossom and the Vegas. Both rolls are not very \"authentic\" or \"traditional\" but both are very tasty. Off of their regular menu, I suggest you try their hamachi yellowtail sashimi with a side of Sriracha, the Sunshine roll and the Spicy Hana roll are both good choices too.  Moira offers many exotic mixed drinks to tempt your palate into trying something new, but be careful of the prices. The drinks can run anywhere from $7 -$10  and add up quickly.   If you're downtown and don't feel like driving far or detouring from the light rail, go to Moira for your sushi fix. They have some solid choices for your sushi craving.",

    "text": "I can't believe it's taken me this long to review Moira. I was there on their opening night a few years ago and while we were all super excited for a more upscale Asian place (and the first sushi place in the downtown area, for that matter), the restaurant had a lot of kinks to work out with delivery of food (particularly getting sushi before hot items) and just service in general. However, we were all pretty happy with the food. While the sushi wasn't the freshest we've had in Arizona, the rolls were well executed and the hot food was enjoyable. We particularly liked the red miso soup with tofu.    Fast forward a few years and Moira has definitely worked out the service kinks. In fact, when my husband and I were there last Saturday night, we had some of the best service we've had in a long time. Our server, Heather C, was really attentive, with prompt drink refills and quick delivery of everything we asked for. The order of the food was all perfect as well, with the items we requested all coming out in the right order.   I still don't think Moira's food is the best around, and I definitely have to give nearby Sens first prize for hot Asian entrees downtown, but it's solid and goes up a notch during HH, when much of it is half priced. I also give the nod to Sens for cocktails, as theirs are sweet/exotic while still packing a punch. I can't say the same for Moira's, which are all sugary sweet. I'd go for wine or beer (or a mixed drink, which was generous for the price) instead.",

I am a fan due to location and ambiance, although a little loud (the music is loud and you have to yell over it to talk, and so does everyone else) and slightly darker than I like to truly see what I am eating. As for the food, it's not the best I have had but the quality was there.  On this visit I decided to try a few items to get a good idea of overall quality.  I had the following:  geisha roll, which has ahi tataki, cucumber, lotus root, cream cheese, and red bell peppers  osuimono, a soup with ebi & japanese cucumber, snow peas, carrots w/ ginger in clear broth  maguro (tuna) nigiri   The roll was tasty and just the right size for enjoying in one large yet manageable bite. (I am not a fan of large ricey fat rolls that take 2-3 bites to eat civilly). The soup came in a cast-iron pot with enough for one person to make a nice meal out of or could be split among 3-4 as a starter. I loved the vegetables I was expecting a little more from the broth, which was as simple as the standard vietnamese pho broth, and as a result I started craving the little plate of lime, cilantro and maybe some hoisin. I would have liked to have tasted more ginger in the broth. The nigiri had nice fresh tuna and didn't disappoint.  I did have some take home left overs perfect for brunch the next day.   I do have a few nit picky things to add, the chairs at the sushi bar, as described accurately by one reviewer as revamped grocery carts, I found them to be awkward to get into and out of. I am just over 5' and I have to take a running leap into the typical bar stool anyway but these were different, getting out of them was more challenging than normal. Once in place I was ok (I have plenty of booty to make up for the lack of a cushion...lol). Again the volume in the restaurant was more than I like. Although I enjoyed the hip music selection.   I will go again, most likely for happy hour or the reverse happy hour I hear (read) about. I would also like to try many of the unique cocktails on the drink menu.",

    "text": "Having lived downtown since 2004, I was pretty excited when Moira came in, and I have gone there pretty regularly since.  They have changed my mind on some rolls (I would normally not eat rolls, but they have a couple unique ones that have turned me around on that, and the sauces that they make for those rolls are incredibly complimentary to the roll itself), they generally have good service, and the decor is very nice as well.  Now for my one complaint :(  I understand restaurants having a policy trying to not seat tables of 2 at 4-tops (I worked in restaurants for years myself, though that also makes me a bit picky about where I sit; I will wait longer for a table away from the kitchen and bathroom for example), but this policy should be adjusted to how busy the restaurant is (including what day and time it is and whether it is likely to GET a lot busier) and how easy it is to split a 4-top into two 2-tops.  At Moira, many of the 4-tops are made from two 2-tops, so they have ZERO issue with the latter, and they should perhaps take advantage of that more.  When I went there last (it was a weekday around 6pm, which is pretty slow and CONTINUED to remain slow), there were SIX empty 4-tops inside, almost all made up of two 2-tops pushed together.  My companion and I were told we could either sit at the bar or sit outside on the patio.  You're kidding, right?  We can't either sit at a 4-top or if you feel that is wasteful, have you split the 4-top made from two 2-tops by eight inches or so, as is common is many high end restaurants in major cities who don't have a lot of available space?  On a weekday at 6pm, when we will be gone in 45 minutes?  That's one nice thing for the restaurant, sushi tends to be pretty quick turnover, versus say a steakhouse.  Well, we wanted to chat without turning sideways, so we went out on the patio, which had heaters which were not turned on and lights that were not turned on (though they did eventually turn on the lights), and guess what?  We sat at a FOUR-TOP out there, and we only chose because it was so dark before the patio lights were turned on that we couldn't see at any other table so chose one by the window to get the light from the restaurant window to be able to see what we were eating.  Through this window which provided us some light, while we ate, we could see every single 4-top inside the restaurant remain empty, and the only two people that came in were seated behind the hostess station at one of the high-tops.  Whew, it's a good thing you saved all those 4-tops so they could remain empty while we ate :)  So keep up the good work on the food and decor, but allow your employees to make executive decisions about seating based upon the time, the day, how busy it is, and how from their OWN experience how busy they think it is likely to become (I assume this is a blanket rule by management, though I could be wrong).  The alternative, which is shoving people onto a cold, dark patio to sit at a table (a 4-top!) that they COULDN'T sit at on the inside, and letting them peer into the warm, well-light, and beautifully decorated interior so they can see all those seats that they couldn't have stay empty the whole time they were eating, doesn't encourage someone to come back.  Unless of course, they have a group of FOUR :)",

    "text": "Not so long ago, Downtown Phoenix was something of a sushi desert with Moira as the lone option for area residents.  I knew of Moira and had passed by their establishment numerous times, but had avoided taking the plunge largely as a result of a lackluster reviews.  In the years since, Harumi Sushi (my pick for the best in Downtown) and Squid Ink Sushi have joined the fray and have largely delivered a good product to the masses.  Recently I noticed that Moira had expanded their outdoor patio to accommodate what appears to be a growing customer base.  Given my love of sushi and these encouraging signs of growth, I finally (after 5 years of living just a stones throw away) set foot in Moira for the first time on a Saturday evening.  On the bottom floor of the 215 McKinley Condos (on the southwest corner of 3rd Street and McKinley), you can't miss Moira's outdoor patio.    The patio seats about 25 while the inside of Moira's long narrow space can pack in about 50.  The dim lights, concrete floors, and dark facade certainly don't hide the fact this is an urban restaurant.  But the aesthetically pleasing lantern lights and segmented seating options (the sushi bar being front and center) set Moira apart from Squid Ink and Harumi with the feel of a neighborhood haunt.  I grabbed my spot at the sushi bar and was provided menus of food and beverages to study right off the bat.  To start with, I was looking for a good Japanese beer.  The Kawaba Sunrise was an intriguing option as I love a good Amber Ale.  And indeed it was a smooth refreshing and not too heavy starter to my evening.  For my appetizer, I ordered their Kara-age.  Fried chicken bites covered in seaweed, chili powder, and sea salt on a bed of cabbage.  It comes with what tastes like a sort of honey mustard sauce mixture.  Think of these as a slightly brinier, slightly more tender version of your standard chicken nuggets.  Decent starter and the sauce was good, though perhaps would've preferred a little more crunch.  For my main entree I was torn as to what to get so I asked the waitress what were their most popular sushi rolls.  Without hesitation she said the Sun Devil was the fan favorite here (and given ASU's Downtown campus is just a few blocks south of here, that makes perfect sense).  So I jumped on the bandwagon.  Tempura shrimp, crab, avocado, tuna, aioli, eel sauce, and topped with sliced jalapenos.  The mixture of sauces and fish were great and the jalapeno spice notes mixed in quite well to give it a good punch.  But I do have an important compliant to register on this.  The rice.  It was too dry.  Rice with just the right moisture content can compliment and accentuate the flavors of the fish, but the dry texture of the rice on this one took away from the fish in my opinion.  Maybe a one time snafu, but an unfortunate one.  Total cost for the beer, food, tax and tip came to about $40.  One thing I will compliment Moira for tonight was prompt and friendly service.  This would seem to be a given at any restaurant worth their name, but I'd noticed a number of Yelpers had logged complaints about their service experience here.  I had no issues whatsoever on the service front.  On the food side however, I would say my experience was just okay.  Cool setup and convenient for Downtown residents and visitors alike, but probably third in the Downtown sushi pecking order as of me writing this review.  I'll come back if things continue to improve, but for now I would still give Harumi my recommendation as Downtown's top sushi destination.",

They offer the bright green stuff too, but if you want the kind of wasabi that will wake up your senses and momentarily destroy your sinuses, this is the place to go.   The atmosphere is stylized and the chairs are strange--  Not in a good or bad way, I can just tell some effort was put into it as a design, but it doesn't move me one way or another.  The chairs are definitely form over function, and form with chairs is pretty important.  I wouldn't put one of these on a porch and drink iced tea, which is a chair Litmus test for me, but I digress.  Anyway, the food is good and priced accordingly.  It seems to me that sushi is not well represented in Phoenix.  With modern refrigeration, I don't see why.  Maybe I am mistaken about the lack of sushi choices in Phoenix, but it seems the culinary diversity of our small-town-big-city would offer more than Moira when it comes to small boutique sushi bars.   Booze side note:  Their drink list is pretty fun.  I didn't have any, but the table next to me had some pretty fancy looking signature drinks.  I had a Hendricks Gin, which I was pleased to see on the menu.  Served on the rocks with a cucumber garnish was delightful. Moira gets the credit for introducing me to my favorite garnish for one of my favorite gins.",

We sat at the bar.  It was nice, but the folks at the bar don't take your order, only the wait staff does.  That's too bad because they were terribly kind but somewhat slow and really didn't seem to care that I didn't have a drink (I was late, so my companion had one) or that our plates were piling up while we were eating, or that we didn't get water....the service is one of the reasons we sit at the bar!    The bar was comfortable enough, but the chairs aren't really easy to \"nudge\" when you need to scoot in - and I am 6' tall and I can't reach the floor to pull myself in the right way - the chairs just stick in place and it's an odd complaint, but it's mine! :-)  I like to cross my legs, so I need to be able to pull the chair out to drink, in to eat, and back out to drink, and in to eat if we are eating in phases - like we do at a sushi bar.  The first visit we were delighted with most of the dishes - especially the hot dishes - they were delicious.  The second time we were disappointed in more dishes than we were happy with.  The rice was dry and fell apart, the seaweed was dry and super chewy!    I promise to go back one more time in a few months ...",

I wish the avocado rolls weren't $7 but that's okay, they are so delicious and fresh, and I wish the soy sauce wasn't sooooooo salty but that's okay too b/c the food is great, the hours are fantastic and I saw they support other local businesses which I am all for. So, over all 5 stars!",

    "text": "I fell in love with this place the first time I went.  We waited at the bar for our friends to join us and the bartender was really friendly and fun.  He offered a lot of good suggestions on making some of the sushi rolls dairy-free and was just generally great to us.  When we were seated with our friends at the table we had a great time with a really excellent waitress who was willing to put up with our shenanigans! I thought the food was wonderful and the variety and uniqueness of the menu was worthwhile too.  Loved the atmosphere too-- hip, but not too serious about it, and nice lighting.    Having had this great experience I decided to take my best friend here when she came to visit from out of town.  Her plane got in late but Moira's posted hours are 5pm-11pm on weekdays.  We showed up around 10pm, pushed the door open, and were abruptly told by the hostess that the restaurant decided to close early because it was slow.  I was furious.  What kind of business turns away customers when it is slow?   We ended up making the short walk over to Angel's Trumpet instead, which was not only open but bustling and crowded!   I'm super disappointed at that experience, but will probably go back and give it another try.",

We went on a Saturday night and there was a short wait for a table for 2. Having sampled a few rolls, I would peg this place as a good option for sushi if your in the area. The fish was fresh and our tea cape out piping hot.  Service was excellent and I was never left looking for some one.  Our waitress was knowledgeable on the menu items and made some good recommendations. I will definitely make my way back here in the future.",

The inside is cute but it has an unusual smell, I think it's from the bathrooms. :( the decor is cute and the bathrooms themselves look very nice. It's a pretty small place and it has a cute little bar. My friend and I ordered the calamari which was different, just seemed like they tried too hard. Calamari is good it's usual way, anywho, I enjoyed it here. We ordered the Sakura roll and it was good but that's it. I'm a big sushi person and although the Sakura was good, it just didn't do it for me. The presentation of the food is nice so I give them an A there... The service was pretty good as well...  I don't know of many sushi places downtown so this one is a pretty okay place. I know there is one in the AZ center that I need to try soon :)",

    "text": "Had some sushi in the desert this past weekend.  My brother and I walked in to the beat of Calvin Harris.  I like me some house with my sushi.  I heard it was hit or miss on the crowd, and it was somewhere in between for a Saturday night.  Vibrant decor was abundant throughout, and it reminded me of a trendy Vegas type bar with its lighting.  So how's the food?  We ordered a few rolls from the regular and happy hour menu.  The poke, white blossom, cucumber salad, fried tofu, sun devil and the sunshine roll.  Everything was good, except the tofu which was just OK. But the poke was tasty.  It had a couple of extra's in it that made it taste better than the stuff I have had before.  Good flavor.   Since we are hot sauce addicts, we asked the chef to make our rolls H-O-T.  He gave us two DROPS of a hot sauce called \"The Bomb\", and a thin wood stick to apply it to our rolls.  Really, are you serious.  He looked at us with a somewhat cautious look on his face and said \"Just a little bit\", it's really hot.  While we tend to throw caution to the wind when it comes to hot sauce, we took his advice and put a dot on our rolls.  You know, that's all you need.  We had 4 DROP's of the hot sauce between us, and trust me, we didn't need anymore. Our hot sauce taste buds were burned...I mean satisfied.    Great sushi restaurant within walking distance of downtown, and really good happy hour specials. We ordered off the late night happy hour menu and the regular menu, a couple of beers and we were right at $70   Not bad for a good dinner and my bro.",

We walked in and immediately the hostess said 'be right back' and left us awkwardly standing in the entrance for a good 5 minutes.  We were already thinking about leaving but were finally seated and each ordered a Sultry Saki from the cocktail menu.  After about 15 minutes without our drink, we were again seriously pondering just leaving.  I do understand when places are busy or short staffed. This really didn't seem to be the case at all.  Plenty of tables empty and a good amount of waitstaff in sight.    Finally our drink came and it was the weakest, worst, watery drink I have ever had.  When the ice melted in the drink, it still tasted the same.  Huge waste of $6.   The worst part of the evening came at the end when I got our bill.  I noticed that our waiter overcharged us for the fried tofu, which is under the $3 menu column.   ***Keep in mind that the happy hour menu is all black with white text.    However, the waiter was refusing to honor the $3 price because apparently in BLACK pen on the BLACK menu was a  HANDWRITTEN in $5 sign, that you could only see if you held your phone light over the menu.  I actually laughed and told him this is ridiculous and isn't going to happen.  Finally he obliged and took of the $2 overcharge.    Long story short, terrible drinks, terrible service and watch out of invisible amendments to the menu pricing.",

Unfortunately a lot of things close early in Mesa so we drove out to Phoenix just for the sushi hoping it'd be good . WE LOVED IT ! We were greeted right away when we walked in & we sat at the bar area. Luckily they had a happy hour going on even though it was around 11 that night . We started with edamame which was soooo delicious !! I usually have to salt and lemon my own edamame at the places I've been too but they were soo full of flavor ! We ordered regular California rolls from the happy hour menu which came with about 6 rolls. Then we ordered dragon rolls which were off the happy hour menu but they were my favorite . They even lit a part of our plate to make it look like the roll was breathing out fire, it was great! Cooks behind the bar were friendly and a waitress kept checking up to make sure we were cool . Great place . We're happy we made a stop there.",

A little on the small side, but it wasn't packed or uncomfortable. Party of sixteen was coming in at 9pm on a Saturday night. It's that kind of place. Hip. Young Crowd. Open Late. Goodness.  The one thing that threw me off, and I regret not speaking up when I was there -- their Salmon Roll is a California Roll with Salmon on top. I was totally disappointed by that, and had never heard of that before. (Not sure if that's a Phoenix thing, as I live in LA and it's not like that here.) I left there craving the Salmon Roll that I really wanted.   The cocktail I got was amazing. I wish I could remember the name. It has Gin, Cucumber and Lemongrass. So refreshing. The Calamari was amazing. Maybe the best I've ever had.   I would definitely recommend this place.   The only requests I have: 1. Notate what's in each sushi roll on their menu... especially if you claim it's the standard basic roll, but it isn't. 2. Make sure that the website functions properly. I can't view many parts of it. I've tried multiple browsers.",

The decor is not too bad except for it being really dark at 5pm. I can barely see our waitress cause she was wearing black and blended into the shadows.   The table is a bit small for two people. There is a candle that doesn't help the darkness much. You get this cute little dish for yourself.   We ordered the  sakura roll (unagi, snow crab, maguro, avocado rolled in soy paper)- our favorite. Flavorful.   Salmon roll- basically a california roll with a tiny piece of raw salmon on top. If you like calfornia roll you would like this.  Boston roll 7 - This was the least favorite. A chunk of rice with a tiny piece of raw fish and cream cheese. Theres also this other thing in it that is kind of crunchy but tasteless.   The prices are a bit high but you get a lot! I think around 8 pieces of the sakura and salmon roll. I believe you get 6 pieces of the boston roll but they are pretty big pieces.  Sushi is sushi. It is either good or bad. This was good but it didn't feel special. That is the reason for the three stars.   If I was ever in town again I wouldn't mind coming back here and trying their hot dishes and appetizers.",

One of my friends ordered a roll (can't remember the name), but it had shitake mushrooms on top and angus beef! Yeah...BEEF on a sushi roll?  I was afraid to taste it...but I'm so glad I did! The combination of the woodiness of the shitake and the flavor of the beef along with the tuna and crab in the roll...WOW!   I can't forget to mention the edamame.  Not just any edamame, garlic szechuan edamae! It was finger licking good!   In addition to their large sushi menu, they also have quite the impressive cocktail menu!

My coworker and I came here at 9.45pm, we saw the board sign that it was Happy Hour time, we didn't know about that so of course we were excited. We entered the place and the server lady (asian, really short hair), she was really nice and greeted us and we requested a table for 2. She grabbed a menu and was ready to give us a seat at the sushi bar, then out of sudden, a grumpy and angry server lady came to her and yelled at her saying \"DO NOT PUT ANYBODY ON A TABLE!\" Really? In front of customers? And my question is WHY? WHY THE HELL we couldn't sit when there were only 4 people at the sushi bar, not to mention there were 5 empty tables outside and you said don't put anybody on a table? She didn't say a single word as to why we couldn't sit or we had to wait, were the tables reserved? Do we have to call and make a reservation first? Or what? We are customers, how are we supposed to know anything if they don't even say anything but yelling and screaming in front of us? I could tell the lady who greeted us is new and after the other lady yelled on her face, she felt bad for us and couldn't say anything.  My coworker and I looked at each other and thought what the hell is going on? So what we're just standing here with no service? That was so RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL...  My review probably means nothing to their business because no matter what people will still go to this place and I just hope other people won't have the same experience.",

Didn't see a server till 8:11 where we ordered our drinks and entire meal at the same time as we saw the service wasn't so good. However, we got all the food ordered at 8:23. Mind you, we still had not received the drinks we ordered.. the sushi was subpar and honestly was not as good as other places we have tried. The udon was very good which is why we gave them two stars. The parking around there is standard street parking and they have an outdoor patio and indoor seating.. disappointing that the sushi and service wasn't better.",

But when we were conveniently close by at Phoestivus and not interested in the food trucks, his immediate suggestion was Moira! It really is off the beaten path because in the many time I've been in the neighborhood bar hopping, I'd never seen or noticed it.   \"Happy hour\" until 11p wins in my book. We ate well for $40 including a couple of drinks, a couple of rolls and an appetizer. I was underwhelmed by my drink but you can't beat $5 wells. The rolls were crazy good and surprisingly filling, and their eel sauce is outta this world. Get the bang bang shrimp for your appetizer as a precursor to the amazingness you're about to eat.   My only complaint was the service. We were greeted and sat at the bar, and promptly forgotten about until I got up after 10 minutes to ask someone for waters and to take our order. Then once we got our drink order placed and gave the chef our sushi order, it took another 10-15 to get our drinks and some water. By no means were they slammed so genuinely curious what the issue was.   Definitely willing to come back again when I'm in the area though.",

Since when does dining as a couple deserve punishment? I don't like sitting at sushi bars because my feet dangle and I feel like a child. So she offered us the \"shorter sushi bar\". My chin hit the fricken bar it was so ridiculous. We got \"table\" sized chairs with a 4\" concrete bar in front of them. It didn't fit. At all.  By the time we were done not even half the restaurant was full and 2 2-tops were still empty! Not happy.  5-star sushi, nori puffs, happy hour prices  1-star for forcing shorties to sit at a sushi bar. That sucked.",

The menu boasted that the shrimp came sprinkled with shichimi \"seven tastes\".. Is that the 7 tastes of the oil it was fried in? That's what it tasted like..  The jade roll was soft shell crab, avocado and cucumber. Sounds good right? Not when it is served HOT. Who ever heard of a hot sushi roll?   So ended the night with two bad experiences at down town restaurants. Triple lame ;(",

And somebody must have hired their cousin as a DJ, because some kid set up speakers and a laptop behind the bar area and proceeded to drive us crazy with his inability to (even try to) beatmatch.  I'm not sure how so many people find this place a winner.  Maybe they've never eaten sushi in a really good establishment.

My silverware was spotty and the soy sauce dish was dirty as well.

Rice dish was ok as well. My friend are it all and said he enjoyed it.    I'd like to give an additional half star since the waitress seemed to be on top of her tables considering she was the only one on shift that day.

Bathrooms are nice, but dirty.  Cons: Food was not good. Sashimi was rubbery, rolls were sticky/rubbery and not tasteful. They only have cans, no fountain drinks, which is embarrassing in 2016. Not a very extensive menu and food was just not good at all. We had several  sashimi and nigiri, rolls and poke.  I will definitely not eat here again.",

So if you're looking for a late night bite or drink don't come here. Cobra is across the street and so is Snoh and they would never rush out a costomer and turn the lights off on you as you're eating.

They have an excellent Happy Hour Monday through Thursday from 5:00 - Close.  Excellent wine by the glass prices and great prices on HH dishes.  We happened in last night and to my delight found out that Thursday is 1/2 price wine by the bottle night.  Had an excellent bottle of Pine Ridge Viognier/Chenin Blanc for $14.  That's pretty close to what you pay for it at the store.  The real delight of the evening was their fried calamari appetizer.  It's one of the best HH dishes I've ever had.  Not only was it delicious but a substantial portion for $5.  The calamari were breaded and cooked to perfection.  They were mixed with al dente carrots, onions, bell pepper and mushrooms.  Served on a bed of cabbage and tossed with a magnificent slightly spicy sauce.  It was so good I almost ordered another.  Our server Kiana was delightful, efficient and attentive.  If you are lucky enough to get her as your server tell her we said hi.  This place is definitely worth the effort to get to if only for the calamari.  Oh, an added bonus is the nice outdoor patio.",

Points for form, but function...? fail.  -The spicy tuna was the most satisfying of the bunch.  -The Philly roll was cream cheese overload... more salmon, please!  -The Fuji was pleasantly spicy.  -The Rainbow Roll was disappointing... whatever it was sitting in (mirin?) was completely overpowering and made the roll a little soggy.",

He was pretty good about suggesting things and steering us away from things he thought we wouldn't like.  I ended up getting the Sunshine (which was AMAZING), Kamikaze and  Kakuna - all were very good with fresh ingredients.

First off, the szechuan edamame was amazing.  I also had the pina roll and the one with beef and mushroom and they were both awesome. I really enjoyed the flavors of the beef and mushroom.  Something out of the ordinary.  I also liked the devil roll. They had icecream for dessert, which sounded good, but I'm usually looking for something crazy for dessert so skipped it.",

Located just around the corner from The Roosevelt. The main points I love about Moira are as follows. Ambiance- really genuinely hip in the sense of New York or San Francisco hip, cool under-bar lighting, massive golden Buddha statues, unique bathroom fixtures and great use of chain-mail curtains :). The whole place seems to maintain a very cool, but not pretentious understated vibe and they usually have some great house music playing. Food- the food is fantastic. Everything we've ordered has been very top notch. We don't do a ton of sushi but what we've had is very good. The dishes we absolutely love are the small stir fry dishes like the Donburi and Pho crunch (the latter is a genius work of texture and taste variations that keep me coming back over and over. The seaweed salad is consistently good and the bomb-diggety appetizer of them all are the Fried Tofu Nuggets- you'd swear they were chicken nuggets. Soooooo good! And the dipping sauce they come with is otherworldly. They have a really interesting list of cocktails which are all worth a try and all the wait-staff is super friendly and accommodating. Truly an understated, largely unknown, gem of a restaurant!",

The tempura was not authentic tempura batter, it was some kind of thin, greasy batter that was not very appetizing. The vegetables were not the traditional ones used either - included red peppers, bok choi, baby corn, no zucchini or squash. The serving was large and we left most of it there (though I hate to waste).  The sushi was just ok.  I had a yellowtail roll, salmon roll, yellowtail nigiri, and smoked salmon nigiri.  As a couple posters below said, the toro was not good quality - unbelievably chewy with \"strings\" throughout, and with a funny taste - I couldn't even finish it (which is crazy).  It looked great, and the portion was generous, but that was it.  No comments about decor, I care most about the food.  Positives: green tea in a pot was nice, rice in sushi was decent, server was attentive.  If you live downtown, it's worth the drive to go to Hana instead.",

It is too bad I don't live in Phoenix because I would definitely be a regular at this place. If you're going here for the first time you have to try their cucumber drink (I'm not sure of the name of it but it was something like chu-cumber). Its got muddled cucumber and some oriental alcohol but the harmonious balance between the cucumber, ginger and alcohol is perfect. All drinks are $9 or $10 bucks so getting drunk here can get pretty expensive.",

I enjoyed the bar seating which allowed me to view all of the house specialties of which I will be back to try. For starters I had the spicy salmon served in baby greens, cucumber, avocado, radish sprouts, seaweed in spicy creamy dressing presented in a martini style glass. It was delicious! Since I love to sample, we ordered a few different rolls and some sashimi as well. The spicy yellowtail was delicious and fresh. My favorite was the volcano, with crab meat and a crispy outter shell and volcano sauce on top. I had a sake that I have not been able to find anywhere else. If you're a fan of sake, the must have here is the Shirakabe Gira. Overall, this place was delicious although a little pricey. I think the quality would justify the expense.",

They no longer serve milk tea and I asked about all the other juices (mango, lychee, coconut, mandarin orange).  All came from a can so I did not order them. The best part about this restaurant was neither the food nor the drinks but the fact that it's downtown and open late with reasonable pricing.

It was busy but there was room at the sushi bar so we nestled in to a couple seats and glanced over the menu.  I wasn't in the mood for sushi and my friend is a vegetarian so we ended up with some edamame and fried tofu.  The fried tofu was really good actually.  Not your typical plain fried tofu cubes, nope this was stuffed with carrots and soy beans then served with a delicious plum sauce.  A little spicy but not too much and really the perfect night cap.  We sipped on our reverse happy hour beverages and enjoyed the quaint atmosphere and pleasant wait staff.  The reason it only gets three stars is because I can't see myself eating at Moira unless it is happy hour.  The prices are a little high otherwise if you ask me, and if I am going to pay a lot for sushi it has to be top notch.  I'm also not a big fan of $10 specialty drinks, I'd rather stay home and drink for a lot less.  And this may be silly but the bar stools are not comfortable so staying for a long period of time is out for me.  All in all Moira is decent and I'm sure I will go back because it is close to home but I can't see myself becoming a regular.",

Anyway, I love this place. The sushi was fantastic (in my opinion) but then again I'm not some self important sushi snob, so take that for what it's worth. Everything tasted fresh and the service was great. The only complaint I have is the chairs..... who's brilliant idea were those horrible wire chairs. My bony ass was not happy after sitting there for an hour and a half.  Whatever, I found a new date spot. The bf was as impressed as I was and since we live so close I'm sure Moira will be in regular rotation. Screw you Zen",

The rolls are original, I like that they have less of the shrimp tempura in their rolls. Their concept is more of a 'club sushi' atmosphere- great for a date, or late-night. My favorite thing about Moira was the sake-fusion drinks. So awesome! The one negative is the cramped tables- I recommend the sushi bar.",

    "text": "\"Meh\" is exactly right for this place. After reading all the 4-5 star reviews on opening night, I was really excited to finally have a sushi place downtown. Needless to say, I was very underwhelmed by the whole experience.   Miso soup was sub-par at best. You'll get much better Miso at Hana (7th Ave & Missouri) or Yasu (near PV mall). Miso is my favorite part of the whole sushi experience, and they did just about everything wrong with it.   Prices were what you would expect for good sushi, but definitely over-priced for the quality that was served here.   Good sushi is about fresh fish, so my husband and I like to ask the chef's for their recommendation for the night. The chef here sent us out toro (it's the fatty part of the tuna, good toro is like biting through butter) which also happened to be the most expensive fish they had. I couldn't even chew through this toro, if this was the freshest fish they had then I am seriously concerned about the quality of their fish. It was like chewing a tough piece of steak and very unpleasant.   The chef came out to ask us if we liked the toro, and when we told him it wasn't good he got very offended and insulted us (basically said that it was because we couldn't tell good fish from bad fish).   Wait staff was also slow (we were the only people there) and didn't know anything about their menu or sushi. Chairs were uncomfortable (they were wire frames, kinda like shopping carts). Tables were too small (every plate and glass on our table was literally touching everything else b/c there was no room).   I could go on and on with the things they did wrong...but I think you get the idea.",

This is the kind of place you take a date to seal the deal. Sexy decor, sexy lights, sexy sushi chefs (if that's what they are called?), sexy bathrooms, sexy metal bead things that lead to the bathrooms, sexy music.   Being a vegetarian I always get the same thing at every sushi place I visit, so I can spot a good veggie roll when I see one. It's easy to tell that the quality of ingredients are above average and super tasty. They have a delish white ale. The HH is awesome and prices in general are fabulous.  Words to the single ladies out there, hit up Moira when you are looking for some sexy. Sushi is way less complicated than a man!",

It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but I have no specific complaints about it, and that is saying something.    The service is always attentive and friendly.  I really have nothing negative to say here other than the chairs are too high at the sushi bar.  I feel like a child in a high chair since I pretty much need someone to push me in once I'm in the chair!  Oh and the music is always just a little too loud.  It's never more than half full there, and that is too bad.  I think people just don't know about it.  It's in kind of a lonely spot on McKinley and easy to miss if you're not watching for it.",

    "text": "It hurts me to say this, fue to the fact that I love local businesses in my hood and I fully support them, but here is another restaurant that I wish would have been better...  Good news...More restaurants opening in Downtown, more options especially late night options...  Bad news...More restaurants opening in Downtown wanting to make a quick buck but does not deliver on food and quality...  I came here with a couple of friends really excited to try the only sushi restaurant in DT open for dinner.  There has been some good review on the place and I wanted to give it a chance...I should have gone north to Hana or Yasu! Walking in, I noticed the decor was another warehouse looking restaurant trying to be modern...only thing is , its not.  From the neon lights under bar to the wood paneling to the tin like tables, chairs, and barstools...its been done 30 times over.  I wish it had more character, a little bit more distinctive.  We are in the art district.  I don't want to walk in a restaurant that looks similar to ones that are already open in the same area?  Okay enough with that, the artist in me is rambling again..sorry..back to the \"food\" review.  Food:  The menu to me was a little confusing.  For being a Sushi joint, it had so many other things also, mostly stirfry items.  I decided to stick to what I came here to try, sushi.  I ordered squid salad to start.  I should not have ordered that to start.  The salad was so salty and it was drowning in dressing...bad start...I then ordered some sashimi including saba, sweet shrimp, and of course my favorite toro.  I was a little disappointed that they did not have uni..how can you not have uni!  Saba...not bad... Sweet Shrimp....foul tasting Toro.....couldn't even bite through it A good sushi joint has to have fresh fish...good sushi needs to be executed by a sushi chef with good knife skills...simple as that.. When your fish is not that fresh and your sushi chef fish slicing techniques are not there, you have a losing combo.  My friend out of frustration had the head chef make us something...He brought out the geisha roll. Spicy tuna is not my thing but out of courtesy, we did ask him to pick, I tried it..it was ok, again I am not too keen on chopped up tuna, which in this case tasted like it was food processed.  A little too mushy..  Drinks: Beers: Been done.  Infused vodkas: Been done Cocktails: Been done.  Good Points:  Nice staff, cool Teapots, and clean restrooms  All in all, I guess I was hoping for a sushi joint that was more innovative and creative with equally good skills to execute.  Maybe I am too harsh.  Or maybe I am just saying it how it is...As I left the joint, I felt like I have been to a sushi restaurant like that so many times before...  Hopefully they will succeed with less critical customers unlike myself..best of luck!!",

Miso soup: There is no seaweed in it.  Salmon was ok but nothing spectacular. One of the rolls had lemon on top of the Salmon. For me there's nothing worse to ruin raw salmon than to put lemon on top of it.  Toro: Mediocre at best. I've had regular Bluefin that was superior to this over-priced Bluefin Belly (11$ for Nigiri).  The Vietnamese Ice coffee, while good and flavorful, was not as good as it is in real Vietnamese restaurants and really doesn't belong on the menu of a Sushi restaurant.",

    "text": "I liked it. There were some highs, some lows and so we're going to go with a strong \"like\" of Moira.  The location is great - I love this little hub near Turf and Sens (and, conveniently, my good friend's apartment). It takes up the bottom floor of what appears to be residential in the upper floors? I might be wrong, but it's a nice use of space. No lot, so parking is kind of lame now that you gotta pump coins into the meters until 8p. But I just turned south on 3rd St. and parked a little ways down the road for free- no big deal.  The service was also great. Our server was friendly, comfortable and on his game. Coming by often (but without hovering or seeming pesky) to clear plates, get more drink orders, refill waters and get orders for party members who trickled in, in ones and twos. He had opinions on the food and drinks and was pretty helpful. At hh, they were plenty of rolls for around $5-$7.  The food was OK. I'm not a sushi person, so it appeared about the same as anything I've seen or tasted from Ra, to be honest. But others at the table had criticisms about what was possibly imitation crab in the Vegas Roll, and other shrug-able bites. Oh, I was intrigued by their edamame shui mai, crispy little balls filled with white fish and soy beans and that come out skewered on stick, and well presented/arranged in bowl. Simple enough to grab a stick and pass the bowl along to share. Cool and unique  Drinks - we were here on hh and I didn't even crack the regular menu, but decent hh specials for the atmosphere and cool-factor. I had an Asahi bomber for $7 and a specialty drink, the Sun Kiss for $6. There were also wine and beer options on the hh menu, but it was select list a drinks, not a catch-all $1 or $2 off deal.   The space is modern chic ... and a bit like every other new cool restaurant in that way. But I like the long sushi bar and about 10 other tables for parties of two and up to six. Lots of picture windows that look out on the street and would be a good spot to perch on First Friday. Bathrooms are well done (I love swanky bathrooms!).   Ah, my one gripe - we were there for about 1.5-2 hours and they had the Portishead cd on repeat. What, am I at the Roosevelt? What is with downtown hot spots 1. playing Portishead and 2. playing it over and over all night??",

The vibe is eclectic. Now for the not so good.  Each time I've dined there, dishes other than sushi were quite tasty, however their sushi really could use some work. When the name of your establishment contains the product you sell, you need to deliver on that one product above anything else. Moira fails to deliver in this critical area. To put into perspective, it is not that their sushi is bad, it is just mediocre and on par with Ra. So just in the same way that Ra is not necessarily bad, neither is Moira. But the expectation as a diner of a locally owned, unique restaurant, is that the experience would be better than a chain restaurant like Ra.  The first two times I dined at Moira, the service was acceptable, yet the third time was not. This was in spite of notifying Moira ahead of time that we would consist of a large dinner party of 12+ people. The night we dined, I saw all of two servers for the entire restaurant. It was not until later that a third server came on duty, but by then it was too late. For a dinner party as large as ours was, we really needed a dedicated server.",

I am a HUGE sushi fan. By sushi I mean RAW FISH. Where's the sashimi menu? No uni? Yes, it is better to be *out* of uni rather than serve *old* uni...but to not have any? Very sad.  Freshly ground wasabi? Now there's something to talk about. NOM NOM NOM NOM.  But that's about it. The rolls were good, but trying too hard to be unique rather than flavorful. The plates were warm and half the rice from the one roll I did have stuck to it.  Moira has a great base to work with...but they'd best get it together soon.  Next time I'm in Phoenix I may stop by again, but more likely than not I think I'll save 50% on the bill and roll over to Sakana off I10/Elliott",

For some reason this place has gotten a reputation of being overpriced for the portion sizes and just overall - run of the mill.  We had a different experience entirely, after waiting a couple of mins for a large party to break up, we were sat and then served quickly. The overall aura was one of fun, with a hint of edginess and modern appeal. So this started breaking away from the reputation as well.  The rolls push the envelope for uniqueness and the apps are just plain tasty. If you're in downtown, there's no reason to miss this place, and definitely no reason to travel 20 mins away to some of its competitors. The beer selection is Asian themed, with a chance for me to get a Tiger beer which brought back some memories of my travels across the Pacific.  All in all - fun times and fun food.",

Halfway through all their meals (drinks, appetizers, rolls, entrees all together) I finally received my one order of rolls. The waitress later came to tell me how it wasn't her fault it was the chefs fault and repeated 3 times that my food was on her way, every time saying \"it's no my fault\". Once I finally received my roll I was told I'd get a discounted meal. Later she handed out the bulls and said my meal was compensated then came back with a bill and said sorry we're actually only going to discount it and handed me the bill. GRATUITY IS INCLUDED IN THE BILL. I always tip but I don't know how I feel about it snuck into my bill. I did not like it and won't come back nor recommend to anyone.",

Not a single other customer was there, and there was no sushi chef behind the bar or anything. They also didn't have any lunch specials. Everything was full price. Maybe that's why no customers were there?  While waiting for someone to show up and take our order, we noticed that the paper menu on our table was wrinkled and filthy. Upon further inspection of our table, we realized that the platters and soy sauce bowls in front of all three of us were dirty. I picked up the bowl in front of me and scraped off various different bits of dried on food, and so did my companions.  We got up and walked out. A place that serves raw fish should have very high standards of cleanliness, and Moira appeared to be woefully lacking in that regard. Very disappointing.",

Service is prompt with orders taken almost immediately and tables are cleared continually.    The edamame is steamed perfectly and salted. I very much enjoyed the kani crunch. (A crab meat concoction with panko generously sprinkled on top.) I was envious when my neighbor called the server over for her spicy yellowtail. I had ordered the same earlier *but* not thought to ask for spicy mayo. (If you want spicy I recommend doing the same.) My version of the spicy yellowtail was just ... yellowtail.  Adorable place well suited for groups. Four tops can readily be combined. I can see this spot being perfect for an intimate date.",

Blah, I jazzed it up with some fresh lemon, and soy. it was very watery.  Now for the Miso soup, Good, and the squid salad generous but not too flavoraful, and the paper napkins are the best I have ever had!

    "text": "I'm not one to go the traditional route. I prefer to pick several appetizers and add a few rolls when I am doing a sushi outing. OMG you have to have the Hama Chili, Crackling Calamari, Tuna Poke and Sunshine Roll. I love spice but when you pair it with grapefruit, anyone can take the heat on the Hama Chili. The Crackling Calamari isn't your vanilla appetizer you find elsewhere. Amidst the crispy tentacles, you have a treasure trove of Asian mushrooms, cabbage and crunchy textures that spoil your tastebuds. And if that isn't enough to have you lusting, the Tuna Poke is amaze balls. I love the rice crackers because it's the only way to \"permissibly\" allow you to scrape the bowl without looking like you lack etiquette. To cleanse your palate of the explosion of happiness erupting in your mouth, the Sunshine Roll is an delish crowd pleaser and closing for your tasting. For someone with a linebacker appetite, I have to admit I was very happily content. Happy belly happy face!!!!  From all the various Buddhas to the chainlink bathroom entrance, I love the setup because it immediately invites you in with the shimmering lights dancing above the bar and the dark decor to be flirtacious. And who can resist a big Asian DJ spinning the best 80s tunes as you down your cold saki to forget the hot days of summer ahead. Definitely making another trip back and will check out happy hour with my entourage. You will not regret it!!! This place oozes sexy and those items are pure seduction.",

    "text": "I have to say it was a bad experience. I'll boil it down: service was terrible, food is overpriced, quality of the food is definitely far from Japanese, let alone Japanese-American fusion; I probably would've had better service and food at the Pizza Hut down the street.  Here's the full story. My friends and I came here as a last resort on a Friday night. I should've listened to the alarms in my head... The place was pretty empty and the decor screamed \"we're attempting to be authentically Asian\" by using replicas of the Chinese stone soldiers that were randomly placed around the restaurant. Also to sell that they were a sushi restaurant, they sold only Japanese imported beer (not bad, but it was $9 for a stout I ordered). The hosts (who turned out to be our server and a bartender) just told us to sit anywhere.  We sat down and waited. No server, no water, not even a menu until the bartender/hostess took notice and got us settled. Food was overpriced. I had udon ($8) and it was clearly piss poor. The udon noodles tasted like overcooked ramen noodles. The broth was salty and wasn't anywhere near to actual udon broth; it kind of reminded me of instant ramen. What also surprised me was the vegetables they decided to toss in (who puts broccoli in an Asian soup!?).  Their sushi wasn't worth the price. An order of Unagi nigiri was $6 for two pieces! The size of the Unagi wasn't bad, but I couldn't get the natural flavor of the eel because it was drenched in sauce; obviously this is a sign that the sushi chef is covering up their lack of confidence in what they created.  Obviously at this point we wanted out. It took us a good 15 minutes to flag down our inattentive server for the check. He drops the check and we realized he didn't split it so spent another 10 trying to flag him (or anyone) down. Luckily the bartender, who was more attentive, saw us, cleared out dishes, took our check, and tracked down the server.  I'm sorry to say that this place is really poor. I do like Asian fusion, but this was horrendous and wallet snatching. Normally I'm a believer in second chances, but I think this experience takes the cake. Take my review lightly if you want, but just know what you'll be getting into.",

The chicken itself wasn't crispy at all.  I really think this place is cutting some weird corners when the owner isn't around. That or the owner has relaxed rules.   Case in point. We arrived at about 1020 pm and the door was locked. They were already closing even though the sign says closing at 11 pm. 40 minutes closing early is a bit much.  In addition, when I ordered the karaage, the menu I believe stated 8 bucks and change with tax. I gave 9 bucks and waited for my change, which was about 63 cents or so, no big deal but it's still money. The staff member proceeds to tell me that they ROUND UP and don't carry change. LOL. Is this actually True? So I got charged 9 bucks total. I didn't even fight it at this point.  I think they did this b/c they already counted up their cash registers b/c they were closing early.

Once happy hour rolled around, we order 4 rolls - Vegas, Shrimp Tempura, Salmon, and Yellowtail. All to which were very disappointing... very bland. Sushi was room temperature, not hot nor cold. Not much texture and little to no taste. The service was medicore at best.. our server didn't come around much and we asked other servers for condiments. After a while, every server that walked by filled up our water... so at least we were never without water but I saw easily 4 different servers helping us. I don't know if that is the type of service they have or they were helping out... hard to say. But due to not so pleasant taste of this sushi...  I won't be visiting again. :(",

    "text": "We walked from my layover hotel after my flight landed late to have a late night dinner and drink here... partly because both Yelp and the restaurants website said it was open until 2300. We arrived at 2224 pm on this particular Monday night. The waitress was sitting where we entered smoking a cigarette.. I'm sorry if I sound snobby, it's unprofessional looking to do that where guests are entering to eat. Literally the smell of smoke as we entered Moira was enough, in itself to turn me away. Next.. we entered and the hostess doesn't really greet us, she only says that we have 4 minutes to order food.. MY this place is winning us over! I even pointed out the hours posted on the website and she said we could sit or not ! IF we had not been so hungry ... We would have left; I was ready to skip the meal and take a chance at the loud sports bar up by my hotel. The cooks all glared at us.. she then told us we would get 'faster and better service by sitting at the sushi bar'. TELL me who says that?!! LIKE silly dummies, that's what we did and I grumbled about having to rush my order and sit in an uncomfortable bar stool after flying all day to my husband. Here comes the 'smoking' waitress now. Did she wash her hands? We didn't see her do anything but come strait to us.. yuck! We rush through our order. We had no time to ask questions because one of the chefs was eight in front of us staring and watching the time. The hot dishes we ordered were really tasty : The Crackling Calamari; an Orange Peel dish  ( I can't remember the actual name), that you choose the protein for , we went with chicken ).. I personally didn't love the sushi, although all that we ordered was on reverse happy hour and had good portion size for the price. I found the rolls to be not cold in temp and that alone not only freaked me out.. BUT, the ones I tasted, were tasteless and lacking in actual 'fish'. Btw, the happy hour menu also listed 2300 as closing time.. and we were one of three couples dining in this small place, so that couldn't be it either. The waitress I do believe saw me checking in on my Yelp app and poured our wines generously, she also kept our glasses of water full, as well as brought a huge sushi rice bowl for us that we didn't touch. But, it wasn't hard to figure out why we were 'advised' to sit at the bar.. they didn't want the clean tables messed up. We felt rushed and the whole experience left us with a bad 'taste in our mouths' .. I wanted to call and speak with a manager today mainly about the time of closing and the rude reception. Won't be back. As there are great sushi places with great services in the valley... this isn't one of them.",

It was not busy the entire time we were there, but yet our food, drinks and even water refills took an unacceptable amount of time.  We had received our  food 40 minutes after ordering and our first round of drinks nearly 10 minutes after that. Our table had asked for Siracha and after waiting 10 minutes and asking a second time, we went directly to the bar to get it.  We had to ask another waitress to refill our water and she apologized for our waitress.   This was an awful experience.",

There's a large selection of rolls and appetizers for $5, and good drink specials as well. If eating at the sushi bar you can hand your menu directly to the chefs. Rolls come out super quick, and are always a fresh and delicious experience. Most recently we tried the nori puffs, which are similar to a crab puff, but instead of a wonton, it's fried seaweed.

    "text": "A Tuesday night sushi craving reminded me why this place isn't one I frequent often; the hostess/waitress started by asking me if I was \"just one\" tonight, which is the first sign that a place should be avoided since their staff don't appreciate solo diners.  Upon sitting down at the sushi bar, I noticed the counter had not been properly wiped down from the previous customers, though who knows how long that might have been. I was presented with the menu and checklist of what I'd like to order, though not informed that I should put said checklist on the fish cases when I had decided on what I would like to order. Having been here several times before--though not for several months--maybe I had simply forgotten, though there was no encouragement or direction by the three chefs behind the counter as to what to do, and the server disappeared for several minutes leaving me without guidance as to Moira's protocol.  I should add that I did order a spirit that comes in a bottle, and it was simply dropped off without being opened or poured from me. Maybe this is a breakdown in what I understand as cultural tradition, but servers usually open and pour the drink by my experience. This particular server didn't even bother taking the glass off the bottle.  The food itself was decent in the sense that it sort of scratched my craving for fresh fish, though other than the sashimi I ordered I was really left lacking. The sushi seemed too big for the average person's mouth and the lobster nachos were much too big for being what could have been an otherwise enjoyable bite-size appetizer.  The food also seemed improperly paced; something that could have been the result of it being a very slow night and a kitchen staff eager to do something productive, but it came at the expense of pacing. I ordered what could be considered four courses, yet almost all of them came out on top of each other with no time for one course to breath before the next was presented.  To top it off, the server/hostess dropped the check off before I had even received all of my order, and never bothered to see if I wanted an additional drink or dessert.  Moira has been around for several years, and based on my experience tonight, I'm puzzled as to why, other than that there are enough customers who don't know better or who have never experienced proper service and food and don't realize the subpar experience they are getting, or that they are much better staffed and prepared on other nights of the week. Maybe the neighborhood is strong enough to keep them in business, though as a downtowner I have to think this will be my final time at Moira. The service was lazy, the presentation of the food mediocre, and the food itself decent but poorly executed.  If you are in the mood for quality Japanese food, there are a number of better options than Moira and I highly encourage you to explore the better options throughout the valley.",

Where all of suburbia exclaims \"Oh, we do have things going on in Phoenix!\" Moira was slammed, servers filling and refilling water cups of those who are too cheap to buy drinks, but want to take advantage of Happy Hour.  Still, the staff was smiling. They hustled and I had 3 people ask if we'd been helped. When we were seated our sever was jovial, made light of the situation and suggested we order most of our items at once so that we'd get everything promptly.   Now, while it wasn't the best sushi I'd ever had (it just wasn't). I am telling you, unequivocally, it was the servers that made my night. At the end of our meal we were approached by another server who made sure we'd had an enjoyable experience. She was extremely sincere and reminded us to come by on Thursdays where the wine is half priced, and the joint is half-filled! : )  I don't know how ya'll do it, but you're fucking rockstars!  Foodwise:   Squid Salad: Generous portion Calamari: Delicious  Avoid: White Blossom roll. I've had a baked scallop roll before. This one...tasted quite funky   : /",

I want very badly to see the downtown area continue to create urban live-work spaces just like this one. So I want to see this business succeed.   Cons  1) Sadly, the food was just \"ok\". There was nothing bad about it. It was fine. But, that's it. It wasn't as good as its drinks, service, or atmosphere.   In short, I might go here for a drink before or after dinner, but I wouldn't be likely to eat anything if I have another option...and I do.

    "text": "How have I not reviewed Moira? I couldn't possibly blog about Moira without linking to my soon to be Yelp review of Moira. Yes it's in a convenient location for me and a number of other Yelpers, but what is the point of saying that when a hefty chunk of patrons are going to be visitors from the 'burbs and Scottsdale and the like? Well they should all have a pleasant experience here, or they're just too damn picky! It's CenPho for goodness' sake!   Speaking of which, SAKE. $7 for a piping hot thingy of sake and a biiiig bottle of frosty Sapporo- That's how I like to start my Friday or Saturday night. Or if I'm in the mood for something sweet, the creative cocktails are a juicy alternative. Do it right, at reverse happy hour.   Ok I've spent 20 minutes rambling about drinks and the reason is that I have only really tried about 4 items on the menu. This is because I am a plant-eater and this is because I really enjoy those 4 items! They are the seaweed salad, miso soup, fried tofu, and veggie roll- in that order, according to my tummy.   Oh and I'll put my two-cents in about the vibe for the malcontents on here. It's hard to have much of a vibe at 5 o'clock on a Thursday when you are a restaurant that is located on a side street, off of a side street, somewhere between Roosevelt Row and the Arizona Center and you pretty much have to know the area to even know where THOSE places are. Whether it's on the slow side or hoppin', Moira definitely keeps it as cool as their indie tunes, blue lights and Buddhas... and the friendly staff can roll with with it- as should you!",

I did this with Tai Mai Shu (this is how he introduced himself, he gave another name later but can't remember it now) and was completely satisfied.    First off this is aesthetically one of the best restaurants in town.  I was absolutely impressed.  To those of you who think the chairs look like shopping carts perhaps you should tell that to MoMA who has the Bertoia Chair ( these are a reproduction of the original) on permanent display.    The food was fantastic and reasonably priced.  Tai Mai Shu told me that there is a happy hour as well as reverse happy hour that I will be sure to check out soon. Everything that I had was delicious and a simple twist on a traditional sushi.  Thanks Tai Mai Shu!  Tai Mai Shu!  Sorry had to say it one more time.",

I would usually get a tako salad but wanted to try something different. I enjoyed it but would have liked a little more crab. I would probably try something else and not get that particular salad again. Not because it wasn't good just wasn't a favorite.  For sushi I went simple and got the Dragon roll. They were really creative with the presentation and it was delicious!  My wife got the Rising Sun roll. As soon as they set it down she commented on the fact that it smelled amazing. She is not adventurous in her eating and this roll was a little new for her. Her comment at the end, \"That was the best roll I have ever had.\"  We will definitely be heading back.",

    "text": "I feel that I should update my review since its been some time since opening night and I have been back many times. I think my initial 5 star rating was due to a combination of what I call the \"Pizzeria Bianco Effect\" (where you have been waiting for so long while drinking wine that anything tastes good) and the fact that I was overjoyed that there was now a sushi restaurant within walking distance of my place.   If you are driving downtown for sushi, and you live somewhere in Phoenix with a neighborhood sushi restaurant, there is a good chance you will probably be disappointed in Moira. Do I think it's the greatest sushi I have ever had? No. But it is my neighborhood sushi place, the only one in fact. I waited a year for it and it fulfills its purpose in my life.   My preferred way to experience Moira is for their Happy Hour or Reverse Happy Hour. I think this is where you get the best value for your money. You do have to choose your rolls carefully, as not all of the HH rolls are good. The white blossom roll is fantastic and I have often contemplated ordering 2 of them. There are a few of their specialty rolls available for HH, as well as some of the standard rolls. One thing that I do not like is that they use what appears to be imitation crab meat in some rolls.   I do wish that they had more wine options for HH but the inexpensive sushi makes me feel better about ordering full price wine.",

Suffice to say, I may have been a little drunk.  But I was still sober enough to remember how amazing the sushi was.  I didn't get to sample much of the menu because the date wasn't that hungry and only wanted two sushi rolls (If there was a rating for dates, this one is slowly getting knocked down).  I started off with a cocktail (Kiss me and like me, I think), which was good, but the bartender forgot to strain the pulp and seeds from the orange.  For dinner we got a roll with tofu, asparagus, and cucumber, and another one with tuna, cream chz, and a light tempura batter.  These rolls were delicious!  The veggie roll was refreshing, and a nice contrast to the savoriness of the tuna roll.  I wish I was with a eating champion, so that we could have tried more rolls.  While I will not be back here with the date anytime soon (f-ing BoSox fan), I will definitely come back to Moira for some tasty sushi.",

Hot green tea served in a heavy pot, good tea.  Confetti shrimp - This was cooked pieces of shrimp, in a wonderful spicy creamy sauce.  The sauce was amazing and the plate looked beautiful.  The portion size was perfect as an appetizer.  Miso Soup -  This was extremely flavorful, a nice deep miso taste with lots of tofu in it.  This was served in a huge cast iron pot that stays on the table.  Really good soup with excellent presentation.   Sunshine Roll- This roll was awesome! Chopped (not pureed) salmon inside with a small piece of salmon on top and a paper thin slice of lemon. Complimented with a few dashes of sriracha on the side. Honestly my new favorite roll.  Not over-complicated, bright flavors, just delicious.  I am a bit weary of the huge over the top monster rolls at some other sushi places, just because this is America does not mean \"the bigger, the better\".  This roll was \"mouth-sized\".   We also got a couple of orders of salmon sashimi, again fresh, nice cuts and fair portion sizes.    They offered complimentary plum wine ice cream that was also fantastic.   Overall I think Moira is a great addition to the downtown movement and can't wait to go back.  My budget is in trouble...",

Her exact words were to 'go to google, type in best sushi in phoenix, and it'll be the top one on urbanspoon.' So that's what I did.  We arrived right before midnight on a Saturday night and the place was poppin! It was so cool to see a sushi place open until 2am! The interior was super hip, with blue lights hanging from the ceiling that simulated rain, and numerous other blue and red lights spread around the place. They even had a DJ that night!  The happy hour was the best part. We ordered SO MUCH food for a decent price! $5 vegas roll? $5 crab-q? Amazing!! Portions were a very nice size as well. The only negatives were the table next to us that was so loud that we couldn't even hear ourselves talking, but that wasn't really the restaurant's fault, and then the waiter was very slow and we had to wait a good 10-15 mins for water refills, which kinda sucks when you're eating stuff that is super salty lol.

    "text": "So the first time we went to this place, my boyfriend and I went with a couple friends and thought the food wasnt amazing but it was decent and close to home making it more convienent. Not tonight, first we were told to choose our own table (mind you all of the tables were empty, who would have guessed?) then once i chose a table which was a four top, i was rudely told that those werent availible and shoved into a two top which was ackwardly positioned against a brick wall. We asked after a couple minutes of sitting there to be moved to the empty space at the sushi bar, our server was kind and said no problem and moved us there, thats where the problems began. We had a clear view straight into the open kitchen. I forgot to mention that my boyfriend is a chef and knows just a little bit about how things should go down in a kitchen , whether it be sanitary or productive. Lets start with a minor issue. They were using the same cutting board, and knives to cut raw beef, raw squid, and vegetables (dirty unpealed carrots). The food came out fairly quickly, which was nice but did not seem to taste at all how we remembered. The spicy tuna  tasted off , not  quite spoiled, but poor quality fish. There was a roll with huge chunks of red bell peppers that just didnt seem to taste right with the shrimp tempura , maybe a little piece but not an overpowering chunk. Then it took forever for our server to even check back on us because all their employees were to busy eating, texting, and talking all in front of customers plain view without a care in the world (where is the manager? maybe texting in back?)Which didnt seem to unsanitary for servers to be doing but then when the sushi chefs are texting with there gloves on while making food it becomes a sanitation problem . Who knows where there phones have been ? It also to almost 20  minutes to be noticed after done eating to get a check? which is definetly a problem in a slow resteraunt where we see them chatting in back . We both have worked in the food and beverage/customer service  industry for many years, and always seem to be good tippers but in this instance we just could not give a 15% tip for such a terrible experience. None the less, we will not be coming back to Moira ever again. Im only giving this place 2 stars so i dont look like that ass that only gives them one star cause the food didnt taste horrible , especially not the first time we ate here.",

Neon lights under the bar, mainstream trance playing a bit too loud for my old age and its dark enough to be some club, BUT the food is outstanding. I've been here a few times and with my most recent visit and few others we have requested the sushi chef just make something up and give us a one off type specialty roll and I would recommend it to anyone. The sauces this guy comes up with are really top notch. It has to be the main sushi guy (I think his names Johny?) or else I have had the sushi fall apart with some of the maybe lesser under studies.  A bit pricey sure but when you ask for shtuff off the menu and they play your game you have to play theirs and it's probably going to cost you.  The ambiance in the day time is a little more suited to a quiet sushi dining experience just so you know. Really the only place to grab fish in the down town area and after some event or a stroll around the Roosevelt area it is a welcome addition to our fair city.   I have experience less than perfect service, at times I think I felt forgotten betrayed and lonely, but it was usually busy and I will give them a pass on dinging them for that to a certain degree... O.k., I take away one star.",

The spicy tuna roll had far too much sriracha, and we could still taste the fishiness of the tuna underneath. Clearly it had passed its prime a week before we ordered it.  The sake sashimi was poorly cut, but the fish wasn't bad.  Our edamame was mushy, brown, and wilted. I'm confused as to why the server or chef thought it was acceptable to bring such poor quality food to their clientele.  Too bad the worst is yet to come. We ordered a roll containing snow crab, cream cheese, seared tuna, and wasabi aioli. That sounds like a good roll, right? Unfortunately, the snow crab smelled like a used tampon. I'm not kidding. It was inedible and the very smell of it caused us to lose our appetites completely. I told our server and when she asked the chef about it, his response was, \"That's how snow crab is supposed to smell.\" I'm sorry, but anything that smells like it's decomposing on my plate is not to be eaten. A friend was daring enough to actually try a bite of it and had to retire for the evening an hour later because she felt as though she had to throw up.  I will never give this place a second chance because I value my health.",

MAYBE 50 at most. nice sushi bar area and tables to look out the window. happy hour menu is quite large and well priced. most sushi is 5 or 6 bucks for 6 rolls. a few drinks/japanese beers on special. most of the beers i'd never heard of so i asked our server, gordon, what he'd recommend as i'm a huge fan of newcastle. he suggested i try the brazilian black beer xingu. my girlfriend ordered some fruity vodka drink, which she really enjoyed. my beer arrived with a frosty glass and it was delicious. not as smooth as newcastle, more like a gordon biersch marzen, but better.   as for entrees, we went with the rock shrimp, spicy yellow tail, and volcano rolls. edamame and cucumber salad for starting. both apps were right on. not spectacular but good. the rock shrimp was crispy shrimp with some sort of sweet and sour sauce, it was pretty good but not a roll...the wasabi was so soft and fresh i could taste it before it even hit my tongue. the spicy yellowtail was delicious and fresh. my favorite though was the volcano, with crab meat and some sort of crispy outter shell and volcano sauce on top. good sushi, i'm excited to come back and try more rolls.  the music they were playing during our dinner was badass. very hip and trendy place and i could see it being an amazing date spot if they had more business. excellent service from gordon. i'll definitely be back.",

I have to wonder if the server just forgot about it, and left it sitting on the bar for pickup, as it arrived about 20 minutes after our first one. my unhappiness and my the redistribution of stars is much more for the fact that, after asking our server to take it away and replace it with another crunch roll, he returned holding the roll and said \"that flavor is because this roll is made with imitaion crabmeat and real crabmeat, so there is a slightly different taste\" i explained that it wasn't the flavor, but the taste of rancid old fish. i have to say that in my 15+ years of eating sushi, i have never been re-served rancid rolls. don't they know that because this is the desert, fish has to be flown in to be fresh, and at 11pm at night, when a customer tells you the fish is bad...it  more than likely is. so for all of you servers out there,  when a customer tells you the fish is rancid,  just replace it! i'll give them another chance, but it won't be for california rolls (how funny i normally don't even order them, but wanted to taste the difference from that and my favorite Crunch roll) serves me right for experimenting! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1st review of Moira was this one.... finally! a place where us late night eaters can go for some delicious and very well prepared sushi in downtown phoenix. i got an email with a note about the newly added happy hour menu (both regular and reverse) and was excited to go try a sampling of the artistic sushi i savored over while reading reviews and sampling experiences, in the local zines. i was surprised that we could arrive at 10:45pm on saturday and the kitchen would still be open with people eating and enjoying a late night rendevous. we sat at the sushi bar, on the most uncomfortable chairs you could ever imagine. the chairs look cool and fashionable, but i still have bruises on my legs from getting in and out of my metal box of a chair. i will never sit at the sushi bar again, so long as they have them chairs (dang one should never say never!)   the food was very fresh, colorful and artistic. the presentation and combinations are phenominal. the miso soup was so authentic and filled to the brim with tofu and cost less than $4 for a cup of tofu filled, yummy, light and fresh miso soup, dang you just can't go wrong! (lucky you tofu lovers-i'm not a fan myself so this was actually a negative for me)  I had the cucumber salad and must say, i was thrown for a loop with this one.  i'm a cucumber salad (sunomono salad) loving fool if i gots to say so myself. Funny thing, i'm not a fan of raw onions so my first reaction to the cucumber salad was \"YUKKIE\" (just in my head) until i tasted it. the onions were so thin, that they tasted delicious in the salad. it added another bite to it, which was needed, because the dressing wasn't authentic in half vinegar to half sugar. they may be thinking of the diet craze, because there was much less sugar in it than there should have been, it was slightly vinegary.   i was pleased with every roll i had! only brought home 2 pieces out of 3 rolls just for me. my sister played it safe and just ordered one roll, squid salad and miso soup. I have to say her squid salad was deo, but only a few bites for me please.   this is definitely a place for all occasions and all sizes of parties, from 1-10 people so utilize happy hour responsibly. get your group on at moira and your friends will love ya for introducing them to the most tasty dishes in town!",

    "text": "I'm a yelp FAN-atic and I usually expect the best experience when I'm trying out a yelp reviewed established that has earned a good amount of great reviews. Ok, maybe in this case four reviews was really taking a chance on a new place but I was brave.   I live in South Chandler, work in Phoenix, and tend to have most of my fun in CenPho. Honestly I love that downtown has neighborhoods with character, unique shops, and trendy hold up on their own restaurants to boot! Anywho, I went to Moira last night with some expectations, mainly a place for good sushi (to satisfy my sushi craving this week), enjoy a martini or two, and to have an amazing experience (well, amazing has only happened once, and that was FEZ).   I went with three other friends, two of whom are sushi lovers and another that enjoys three things at sushi joints and that is, veggie tempura, a california roll or something like that, and an eel roll of sorts. Anywho, from the outside, Moira it looked cool, very urban chic on a quiet street. The hostess was really nice and the layout was how it was described in the other reviews, very modern with the whole urban feel. I don't know but the bar area reminded me like a pei wei setup, and the whole leaning buddha frames seemed out of place.   With the ambience in place, I was looking forward to my sushi experience, so we waited at our table, and waited a few more, and waited... to the point of after 15 minutes of not getting any waters or seeing any sign of a server coming up to us, my antsy friends were asking me if I knew any other sushi place we could go to in the area. Oh maybe I should note the time we first sat down, it was 7:25PM. And the restaurant was somewhat busy, a large number of tables were filled, and it was really cold.   Finally we were served water of which our server asked out drink orders and appetizers. We got ourselves an order of the calamari and the veggie tempura. then we waited... I have to admit we got our drink orders quite quick, I'd say 15 mins tops followed with our apps. The calamari in my opinion tasted interesting. My friend, S. described it as tasting like kung pao sauce with calamari it was sweet, yet had a little spice with red peppers, some mushrooms, onions. It's not a calamari that I would want to try again but it wasn't bad either. The veggie tempura was basic, some baby corn, yam, the usual in tempura batter, nothing special nothing unique. So let's talk about sushi.   S. and I shared three rolls, they were the spicy yellowftail, the jade, and the zu. D. had the geisha and the eel cucumber. We were hungry and after eating our mediocre apps, we waited and waited, ok let's say service was slooooowwwwwww and when you have slow service and hungry sushi craving people, tempers flare and what was supposed to be a great dining experience suddenly becomes a bad one.   When your server drops off hamachi yellowtail sashimi on the house because of the long wait, you know service is slow, and when you are told \"I'm sorry for the wait but we only have two sushi chefs in the back and alot of orders\" you know it's poor prep, and therefore slow service.   The hamachi sashimi was good but who serves sashimi without wasabi and sushi without wasabi and ginger? Apparently Moira does. And honestly why would I the customer have to ask a server at a sushi place for wasabi and ginger, I would think that's a basic requirement. So we waited close to 25 odd minutes for my friend D's rolls which were the geisha and the eel cucumber... 10mins later came our first roll the Jade, 10mins later the Zu.... and then my friend A. who ordered Sashimi and Negari, her oder came in 15 mins after. As you can see our orders didn't even come close to each other, so instead of us enjoying our meal together, it was like watching one person eat while the others waited. We finally got our last roll, the spicy yellowtail 20 mins after A.'s order. And got our check at 9:10PM. I enjoy a leisurely dinner when I'm out with friends but something I choose to have and not because a restaurant's poor service is forcing me to have a loooong dinner.   Alright sushi not phenonmenol sushi accompanied by a slow inattentive service made my night out at Moira not that great. Servers should attempt to check on their customers every so often, I feel that they seemed shorthanded given it was a Wed. evening but still that is no excuse for slow service. I don't believe I'll come back to Moira again. I just felt shortchanged that something with promise could have turned out for the best but in this instance it marred my sushi night out. it's a thumbs down for Moira.",

    "text": "I'd happily eat there again if hungry and in the neighborhood, but I can't say I'd make a special trip.  Mostly the basics here, typical rolls and sushi selection with nothing out of the ordinary (I'm thinking you're out of luck if you are hankering fro monk fish liver).  We ordered a yellow tail hand roll and asked of they could do it with scallions...nope, they don't have scallions (isn't yellow tail & scallions common?).  They did happily prepare a salmon skin hand roll for us even though it is not on the menu on the menu.  Despite the odd construction (all the rice in the bottom and all the salmon skin on top like ice cream in a cone), once I figured out I needed to redistribute the ingredients, it was quite tasty.  The soft shell crab roll was on happy hour special and a simple bit of tasty goodness.  The salmon sashimi was ok - the fish was fresh, but didn't have the melt-like-butter quality of some of the top notch places.  Service was pleasant, and the atmosphere is urban with a bit of funk thrown in.  The floor to ceiling windows face north, allowing abundant natural light without overpowering the place.",

    "text": "Wow... ate here on 4/17, and was really looking forward to it, but Moira struck out on all fronts when it came to the sushi.  I loved the look of the place when we walked in, and hopes were high, until we started eating.  The service was sub-par, as were the drinks, and then came some of the poorest quality sushi I've ever had... especially when you consider the high prices.  (The Sakura roll - our server's recommendation, turned the stomach with its funky aftertaste).   After reading the initial reviews, did Moira give up after opening night?",

That is appealing and nice. But sushi was okay. They take risks which i respect but missed it a bit. And service was okay. They tried for like 5 minutes and its like they just didn't give a shit once we ordered. It's expensive and over rated. I was just annoyed by the time I left. Go if u want a cool environment and location but other then that it was ...eh'",

I love that on a friday or saturday night on foot downtown, I can stop for some yummy food pre-dancing or post adventuring.   I've been slowly but surely sampling all of the rolls they have for happy hour. The kani crunch is delicious, as is the white blossom and fried tofu and just about everything else I've tried. The seaweed salad is what dreams are made of. The drinks are good, too. I really enjoy the lychee one and the orange blossom.   We always have Heather as our server and she's terrific!",

    "text": "After moving here a few months ago the search has been on to find a decent sushi place in Phoenix, after all, it's Phoenix.  I don't set my expectation too high because I know how difficult it can be to get fresh sushi here.   I enjoyed Moira because their creations are simple and they don't drown the sushi in sauce like some other American sushi joints.  Sushi is about the rice and the fish.  Both were pretty good here.  The salmon and the white tuna nigiri were fresh tasting and soft and the rice was great as well.  The kamikaze roll was also delicious, but maybe could have used a little more spice. They have the best miso soup I have had since living in Japan.  Very tasty, not watered down or flavorless like most other places. The drinks creations are fun and tasty, I went for the favorite karma.  I like my drinks like a like my women, spicy, sweet, and filled with booze.  Our waitress said she would even be open for a new creation if we gave her some ideas. The service was great and friendly.  We were there on a Friday, but surprised it wasn't loud and bustling.  I can see how it could be at times as it is a little small.  Fun and modern decor, clean place!",

Cant stand this type of \"ambience\" either.  Neon blue lights on brick is not my idea of a cool dining room.   Crappy techno in the background too.  Oof, screw this place.   If I'm paying 8 dollars a piece for 2 small pieces of sushi, they better blow my face off.   And they didnt even come close.  Two stars because the ice cream was awesome.",
