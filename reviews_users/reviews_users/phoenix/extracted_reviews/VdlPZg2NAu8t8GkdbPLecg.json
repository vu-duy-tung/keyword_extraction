    "text": "As it has already been said the service ruins it.  We waited for well over an hour to get our food.  Apparently the problem is they only have 1 cook...so you get your food when you get your food.  I am usually not a big fan of Indian food, because it sometimes is just too spicy, even the bread was like eating a jalapeno., so that also plays a role into my rating.  I just came here as my brothers invited me to dinner, brothers night out sorta thing and I just went with the flow.  I will say the server was awesome to me,  gave me free mango lassi which tasted so lush.  2 stars to the restaurant and 5 stars to our server.",

The problem may have been the waiter but our appetizers didn't come until 10 minutes later when we had to remind him that it hadn't arrived (he forgot).  He forgot the Channa Masala and we were too far into our meal to ask for it again.  He didn't ask us how hot we wanted our food so it all came out bland without much spice.  If you look at my ratings for Indian cuisine, I pretty much love all of it.  By far the best I have found in the Phoenix area is the Dhaba in Tempe.  Here the food was fine but given the alternatives, I wouldn't go back.  The veggies were too mashed together and the Chicken tikka masala sauce was too thick and goopy.  The lamb biryani was good but since they made it so mild, I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have.  The atmosphere is cute and more upscale than most Indian restaurants and the mall area is attractive and upscale as well.",

I really enjoy their wraps, an easy and quick eat that's also delicious. I really like their naan choices too, lots of different flavors, very tasty. I like to get their tandoori chicken, pretty good - not the best I've ever had, but still, if I want tandoori chicken, I don't have too far to go. Definitely a good location. Prices are okay - in my experience Indian restaurants always seem kinda pricey; and the charging extra for rice is normal, though I don't care for it. I mean really, who isn't gonna need rice with their paneer?  I think the one complaint I have is the service. It doesn't matter when I go there or how crowded it is or isn't - the service is always slower then I'd like. And it's a different waiter everytime - so I don't get that.  Still, worth going to on the ocassion I am craving Indian food.",

So much so, that if I see a sign from the roadway advertising Indian Food, I'll veer across three lanes of traffic, driving as though I'm Vin Diesel's stunt double in those \"Fast and Furious\" movies, all in an unashamed effort to sample their worldly delights. Well, Tandoori Times is just one of those places.   When I'm in the mood for Indian, I will typically run other drivers off the road, push mothers with strollers out of the way, and knock the legs out from under old folks, on my way to TD. And all for one menu item.  The Bengun Bhartha.  This eggplant dish is so glorious, it's as though it was passed down from the Garden of Eden's secret recipe book, which Eve presumably stole right along with that apple. All the other menu items are good if not great, but as I say, the eggplant is one of those dishes that makes me fantasize about it while I'm eating my wife's homemade cooking.  I hate to admit it, but TD has made me a food philanderer.   As far as service, ambiance, and everything else, who cares.  When you love something as much as I love their eggplant dish, the waiter could have servers Alzheimer's, my table could be in the middle of the parking lot, and that idiotic Indian music could be blaring faux  Barry Manilow. I simply don't care.  Just give me the eggplant, some chai tea, and a guest who hates Indian so I can snag all the leftovers.",

    "text": "2 stars for good food but crappy service.   I was raised on Indian food, and know what I like. I heard that Tandoori  times was a great restaurant, so my boyfriend and I decided to eat there a few weeks back. I had been looking for a new Indian restaurant and was excited to try it out.    The restaurant was busy, and we waited about 5 minutes until a table was available.  We were seated on the patio behind a pillar (bad idea). Our server came over after a few minutes to take our drink order.  He came back with our drinks, and we were unsure as to what we wanted to order for dinner but we ordered the aloo tikki to start.   The appetizer took a long time to come out (about 20 minutes) and our server didn't come back to take our order until shortly before our appetizer arrived.  We ordered the bengun bhartha and chicken curry with garlic naan.   Another 20 or so minutes went by after we were finished with our appetizer before we saw our server again. He set our dishes down and asked if we wanted anything else. I asked if we could have a side of rice because I just guessed that he had forgotten it, or it was on its way as all Indian places I have been to serve rice as an accompaniment to dishes.   I told my boyfriend I didn't want to eat my meal without rice, so I waited about 10 minutes.... no rice... our server continued serve other tables and walk away before my boyfriend could flag him down. Finally, I decided to not let the already mildly cool food get colder, so I reluctantly began eating.   The curry tasted great and was well spiced.  I also loved the bengun bhartha (I have only found one place that makes it the way I like it).   After we were done eating the two dishes, the server finally came over (no rice in hand) to ask how our meal was.  My boyfriend politely asked for boxes, our rice to go (since they seemed to be still cooking it), and the check.  We waited another 5 or so minutes to get our bill, and the server says, \"don't worry about the rice.... it's on me\"  WHAT?? WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR RICE????   My boyfriend got up and went looking for the manager. He spoke to the hostess and found out the manager had stepped away, but she called and spoke to him. My boyfriend explained our experience, and how it was our first time dining there. The manager said that we would either wait for him to return, or the hostess could take 15% off our bill.  Not wanting to wait any longer for anything else, my boyfriend just asked for the discount.   The food was great, but the service was crap. Absolute crap. Unfortunately, due to that first impression, I don't want to go back.",

I still can't place the extra spice they put in it.  The saag ghosht was superb, just really an excellent lamb dish.  Tender lamb and mildly spicy spinach gravy.  And of course the chicken tikka masala was solid.  And TT serves gajrela, an Indian carrot pudding.  It's been a few years since I've had gajrela.   I still love it.    Service was friendly and speedy.  The belly dancing with the sword was unexpected.  My only concern with TT is that if that was its Saturday night rush, then I hope they are making it up during lunch.  The place was only 20% full.",

My boyfriend's parents were in town for Spring Break this year and I had been wanting to try this place out for quite some time, so the four of us grabbed an early dinner after watching the A's beat the White Sox.  I should have known it was going to be a poor experience when we drove up and saw how \"fancy\" the outside was. Our waiter was rude, and when taking our order he dropped the (empty) tray once. There were only a couple of other tables with people at them, so it was pretty loud. When our food came, the waiter dropped my plate on the table, and my food got all over the table, my shirt, and even my purse. He brought me napkins a few minutes later so I could clean up his mess, and dropped his empty tray yet again. It took him forever to bring us the bill, or extra Naan, or anything we ordered. Each time we waited, I looked over at the bar and he was just standing around drumming his fingers.  The food was very bland. Even with a ton of heat/spice, the blandness overpowered everything. My boyfriend's mom is not picky at all, but she could not eat her food.   The only reason I'd even give this place one star is the mango Lassi was delicious, the naan was good, and my boyfriend and his father really enjoyed their huge Taj Mahal's.",

Being Indian cuisine, most of the dishes have a fantastic spicy flavor; unfortunately my wife doesn't share this same sense of taste, you can request that they keep the spice to a minimum if you can't handle it.",

I was so excited to finally come here with my coworker after trying to schedule lunch for over two months and this is our usual place. We came in at 12:20 and placed our order and my coworker asked for a small side of sauce for the dish that I had ordered. At approximately 1:10, another server came to our table to tell us that our order was somehow lost but they were working on it now. Fifteen minutes after that, the food finally came out. The food, as expected, was delicious. So much so that conversation ceased. Then came the check. First, they charged the full value of a dish ($12.95) for the side of sauce...again sauce for a dish they were already preparing!! Just the sauce cost as much as the dish I ordered. So...we bring it to their attention and request they pay for the appetizer, since we waited practically an hour for it. They come back with a revised check. The sauce...just the sauce...now only cost $7.95!!! For a side of sauce...tomato based curry sauce! Seriously?! I could have just given her my leftover sauce! And the discount we got was 10%. Making for a $40+ lunch for two that took an hour and a half!! With no alcohol!! Where is the customer service? Seriously?!?!!! I won't be coming back!",

In the end we stayed safe and chose two chicken dishes (saag and vindaloo). While waiting I went to the ladies room but it was out of order and there was a sign that said to ask for assistance. So, I asked for assistance and was asked to wait for another server. I sat wondering what kind of assistance Id be getting with the bathroom, then a lady walked over and got a key out of the register. She motioned for the bartender to follow her to show him where the bathroom was, too. I then embarked on a journey out the door, across the shopping center, up a flight of stairs and into a vacant office space's dimly lit bathroom. With a restaurant server and bartender in tow. I took care of business and walked back to the restaurant where lunch was waiting.  Why 3 stars you ask? Because the food saves this place. It was awesome, I mean really really good. Loved every bite.   Perfect? No, but that's why they invented carry out.",

Not just a little over cooked, the whole bottom of each piece was black charred burnt. Completly ruined the meal.  The Tiki Masala and Vindaloo were both good but for the price...I can get just as good and bigger portions just about everywhere else. The prices were really over the top. You pay for rice and nan as well regardless of what you order. I did not feel like I had a $50 meal by any means and that is what 2 dishes, one \"small plate,\" nan, rice, and one drink cost us. We were both just full but had I been with a guy or my step father, we would have needed more food for 2.   The atmosphere is great, the place looks really clean. The nan was so bad though that it ruined the meal and even if it was perfect, I still would have only given it three stars because the prices are just way more than everywhere else. I had more reasonable meals at the best indian cuisine restaurants in San Francisco!  Our server was good, however, after our \"small plate\" she seemed a little put off that we wanted clean plates for our meals. She did bring them and was nice about it but we shouldn't have had to ask. With all the sauces on the meals, mixing them would not have been good and our plates were clearly very dirty after the appetizer.  Won't be back. Just not worth the price.",

We had a movie show to catch at 9.45 pm, but I figured, 1-1.5 hour for dinner should be enough time. Boy, was I wrong. We arrived at 8 pm and 5 of us were seated in a booth for four people. Go figure! After 5 minutes, we pulled a chair for the fifth person. Not a big deal, but you expect better when you make dinner reservations before hand.  Anyhow, it took a good 15 minutes for our server to greet us. By this time, we had our entire order ready to be placed. At 8.15, we place the order. Our drinks were served at 8.25 pm. It was just Kingfisher, so I guess we got lucky there.   It's 9 pm now, 45 minutes since we placed our order, and our food is nowhere to be seen. We try to get a hold of our very busy, slightly rude or maybe he just had a very dry sense of humor that none of the five people in my party really understood. We told the server that we had a movie to catch at 9.30 and were hoping to get the food asap now. The server tells us that our food is almost here, with no sign of regret.   10 minutes later, it's now 9.10 pm, our food is still not here. My friend and I go over to the counter and ask our server (who is now the bartender?) and he tells us that we are second in line. Second in line 55 minutes from placing the order? You got to be kidding me! Anyhow, very politely we requested him to cancel our order, since we really didn't wanna miss our movie. Then our server disappears. We get hold of another employee outside the kitchen, requesting to cancel our order. At this point, we just wanted to pay for our drinks and get out of there! The second employee then goes in and 5 minutes later, our server comes out of the kitchen with our food. It's now 9.20 pm! Exactly 65 minutes from placing the order, and 80 minutes from being seated. We literally swallow our food and got out of there at 9.35 pm. Of course, we were late for the movie, and got the 3rd row from the front!!   To sum up: a) I made dinner reservations. b) Got seated in an undersized booth for 5 people c) Waited for 80 minutes for our food.  d) Ate our food (which should have been a pleasant experience) in less than 15 minutes. e) Got late for the movie.  Definitely one of the worst restaurant experiences!! NEVER AGAIN!",

I want one thing to be clear; when I say that the service was terrible, it was no fault of the service staff.  These people were running their asses off doing everything they could do to make the situation better.  The problem is that they are terribly understaffed.  I don't know if this is the result of a cheap owner (which I'll never understand since waitstaff is paid so little) or some call-offs or what, but regardless, there's only so much they can do.  It took 20 minutes to get greeted after being seated, a LONG time for our food, our bill, etc.  What should have been a quick dinner took around two frustrating hours.    Now the food made a horrible situation almost tolerable.  I still will probably not return because I rarely have time for a two hour dinner, but the food was damn good.  I was expecting watered-down white people Indian food, given the location and what I've had elsewhere in the area.  I'm happy to report that this wasn't the case.  The spices were bold and delicious and the chilli paneer had me sweating a bit.  It was excellent.  I hope they don't give in to those with \"sensitive palates\" and continue the authenticity of their food.  If only they could get the service piece figured out.",

Dateline 7 May 2009 Scottsdale, Arizona      Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, \"That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff.\"      Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, \"I really like the onion naan.\"  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.      The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was \"...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger.\"  This has not substantiated, however.      Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was \"Yummy.\"      Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.      An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.      Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; \"...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again.\"",

It is kind of hidden in the shopping center - I suggest they get some better signage.  But we're smart girls, and we found it... it looked pretty dead from the outside but once we were led to a table, we saw a few other parties dining (including some friends of mine on a date!).  While our service was attentive enough, our waiter kept attempting to talk us out of what we wanted to order and tried to sell us something different.  For example, when we ordered the chicken tikka masala, he suggested we order chicken chile instead.  No thanks!  And when we ordered the bengun bhartha (eggplant dish), he suggested something else too.  We stuck to our guns though.  We were girls that knew what we wanted!  In addition to the dishes above, we shared a house salad, rice, and a tandoori roti (whole wheat bread made in the tandoor oven).  We would've ordered an appetizer of sorts (Ie: samosas) but you have to do that during certain times of the day and we missed our window for that.  (Kind of odd, huh?!)  Nonetheless, I enjoyed everything although I added a lot of hot sauce - it didn't have much kick without it.  Gotta love that hot sauce!  I really enjoy Indian food and don't eat it as often as I'd like.  It seems that many people are not up for adventurous eating... I don't get it!  Regardless, I'd come back to Tandoori Times in a heartbeat.  It didn't knock my socks off but it was a pleasant experience with attentive service, decent ambiance, and moderate prices.  Thanks to Kathleen M for trying something new with me!",

It is completely empty of customers. Nice bar to the left with about 4 people who seem to work there but we were ignored for a few minutes till someone notices us and says, oh you can sit anywhere. So we do. We get water immediately. Then a wait of about 10 more minutes in an empty room (while the 4 keep on talking) till someone else (our server) arrives with more water and menus. Other than that it was ok. We had the tandoori wraps - very good. The rest of the menu looked worth trying. Evidently they are getting a new menu June 1. Interesting concept of a card that you get cash back on your food totals - ask about it. The only other thing worth mentioning is that it would be nice if raita (even plain yogurt)  was free on request - $2.50 is a lot for it, even if you get a lot  - more than needed. And they were out of the 12oz Kingfisher bottles.  Ryan (our server) was very nice. Interesting decor, Indian but not cheesy.  Funny sidebar about a group of 3 (highly tattooed) who had never eaten Indian food before and were given quite a thorough introduction ... always glad to have my stereotypes challenged :-) give it a try.",

It's worth it!   Upon entering Tandoori Times, located next to the brand new \"Forbidden\" night  club on 5th avenue in Old Town, Scottsdale, I notice what I like to call an Honesty Kitchen.  (The first thing I noticed, was the familiar fragrances one always smells upon entering and Indian Restaurant).  I have never seen an Honesty Kitchen in an Indian Restaurant.  It was Amazing!  Not only can you watch the chef's skewering the meats and vegetables on the long spikes and placing them into the enormous tandoor ovens, you can also see them do little dances as they cook.  I enjoyed watching them just a bit more than the belly Dancer (on busier nights), although she was just darling.  I avoided her whenever possible. Back to the food- You can find the usual fare of  Naan, Tandoori, masalas, chutney as well as a bevy of vegetarian favorites.  Each time I have been into the restaurant i was met by the gracious owner, Sonny, who has greeted me kindly.  His friendly and surprisingly knowledgeable staff are equally welcoming.  The patio is roomy but last I checked, needed some attention. I would probably not dine here then go to Forbidden for all  night dancing, but that's just me.  Instead, I would recommend the opposite.  You may not find what you want at the Clubs, but you will find it at Tandoori Times.",

    "text": "My wife and I were looking for a good Indian restaurant in Scottsdale and came across Tandoori Times thanks to Yelp.  The reviews were positive, service was question mark.  We were prepared for the wait.  We went on Sat. Night at 6:30 and sat right down.  We were well fed and walking out in just about an hour.  The service was friendly and great.  The Garlic and Onion Naan were great as recommended, so was the Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Saag.  We are locals and like some spice in our food.  We are used to ordering spicy Mexican and it being just right.  We did the same here, \"Wow\" they meant it.  Loved it, but had a nice sweat going.  We were told after that mild is a 5 on spice meter, what we had was 8 out of 10.  You might try mild first trip.   I did not give 5 stars due to that being a rare mark, for off the chart experience, like the old Sea Saw or Binkley's.  We left with a great dinner experience and a take out menu.  We will go back, maybe mild next time.",

The other two people I was with had the Chicken Tikka Masala and a fish dish in a masala-like sauce.  Each of us raved about our meals as we ate them, and then we raved again as we ate the leftovers.  My dish was perfectly spiced and slightly sweet and just typing about it is making my mouth water.  The garlic naan was excellent as well.  I NEEDED a favorite Indian place in Phoenix.  I am very much looking forward to going back to Tandoori Times.  I have high expectations and hope beyond hope that I will have the same excellent experience next time.  Will keep you posted...",

    "text": "I was excited to try Tandoori Times as good Indian good food can be hard to come by here in Arizona.  I was even more encouraged when I walked in and found an almost exclusively Indian (appearing) clientele.  To begin, the service was a little off.  There was maybe 10 people in the restaurant yet we waited a full five minutes or so for a greeting.  When he did come by, he asked if we were ready to order and I looked at him and said, \"You know, we might need to look at the menus first.\"  Perhaps he's used to \"regulars.\"  Anyway, we began with the Onion Bhaji, essentially an Indian version of onion rings, and Raita, a cucumber, potato, mint and yogurt sauce.  The Onion Bhaji looked good in all its fried glory, but was so heavily battered my wife and I both felt ill after trying a few pieces.  You could not taste the onion at all.  Major disaster.  The waiter began to redeem himself by noticing that we had hardly touched it and offered to take it off the menu.  The Raita was fresh and flavorful but didn't exactly fit with anything we ordered and a recommendation of what to eat it with would have been helpful.  We also ordered the Naan and simply put it was killer---hot, light, wonderful.  First score at Tandoori TImes.  My wife ordered the Chicken Makhani and one sampling of the sauce had us both oohing and ahhing at its rich, buttery flavor.  Nothing to say here again but killer.  I ordered the Lamb Korma, and though I found the dish to be decent, it was just very plain when compared to other Indian dishes I have had that just burst with varied bold flavors.  I also asked that it come spicy (6 out of 10) but instead it came with NO spice at all, while my wife's dish came pretty hot and was supposed to be mild.  I wouldn't order again but it may be right up someone else's alley.  FInally, we ordered a plate of rice to accompany our meals.  The rice looked and tasted like it had been sitting around since yesterday (and maybe it was!).  My wife grew up on rice and loves it more than she loves me, so when she frowns at the sight and scowls at the taste of the rice, it is bad rice.  I could justify giving Tandoori Times less than three stars but something tells me another visit may render us happier customers.  I'll try it again, but only one more time before I chalk it up to \"just another Indian place\" where the food and service simply fall short.",

    "text": "Imagine if you were Pakastani and you wanted to open a restaurant that would cater to the mainstream. You would make it trendy inside. You would offer a nice bar. You would hire American people as your servers. And you would make the food not so spicy. In essence, you would create the PF Chang's of Indian Food. You would give it an Indian sounding name like Tandoori TImes and remove any vestiges of Pakistan as Indian restaurants are better recognized and thus seen as a safer option among the mainstream.  Well, that's exactly what Tandoor Times is.   Being Indian, I prefer Indian food meaning I like all the grilled meat items but they better be able to make quality sabjis and vegetarian dishes too.  Tandoori Times is a Pakastani restaurant; it's not an Indian restaurant. It's almost the same but their dishes are different. Pakastani cuisine involves Tandoori items and grilled items. Their cooking style is less spicy and offers less cream in their dishes.  Indian (Punjani/North Indian) food involves Tandoor items as well in addition to vegetable dishes, more variety and types of curries and is spicier and more flavorful in general. If you are a non-vegetarian like myself, you can survive on the curries and the shish kebob and other meat items. However, when you taste their chaat, deserts and vegetarian sabjis, this restaurant clearly does not know what they are doing.  If you are vegetarian of Indian descent, you will be sorely disappointed.  Nothing against Pakastani cuisine but vegetarian dishes are not your forte much like curries and grilled options are not really a part of South Indian cooking.    The food is on the mild side. Of course, if you ask them to make something hotter, they can but their food in general is not very spicy and is bland with the exception of some of their curries.  If you are a Non-Indian and you want to try Indian food for the first time, this would be a good place to start. If you are someone who has eaten quality Indian food and wants the real thing, avoid this place because this is as far from being the real thing as possible.   The service and ambience was quite nice. I think that's the real draw of this restaurant since most Indian restaurants have poor service and often a dirty or claustrophobic environment.  This is a trendy restaurant in old town Scottsdale that you could take a date to.  The service was good when we went there but at the same time the servers were pretty ignorant of the menu and didn't know a lot about Indian food.  Being Indian, this place was just a bunch of hype.  Yes, it was neat to see friendly American people serving Indian food since I'm used to Indian waiters who are abrupt and to the point.  I liked the ambience but the food was disappointing. Their palak paneer honestly tasted as if some non-Indian person decided to try and make it from a cookbook at home. It was not spicy nor was it cooked properly. Their malai kofta was not even malai kofta....let's put it that way.  I will say this, their Tandoori chicke was probably the best I've had in the valley and that's not suprising since Pakastani cooking involves meat and they know how to grill meat well but outside of their meat dishes, it was completely lackluster.   The bottom line is that if you are an Indian person or a person who is used to eating quality Indian food and you want honest to goodness quality INDIAN (not Pakastani) food, avoid this place.  If you are a non-Indian person wanting to check out Indian/Pakastani food and just want to have a good time, this place is for you.  Note, however that the prices are rather high for an Indian/Pakastani restaurant so you are paying for that ambience.",

I've been going to tandooori times for past 6 to 7 years but never experienced such a bad customer service from restaurant owner. We were waiting by the bar and the table opened up so we move forward to be seated and another customer grabbed the table without asking anyone else. The ppl worked  there couldn't speak up so we ended up getting a table in the corner. At this point we were waiting there for 45 mins. On top of that another server grabs our food and serves another table. Waiter came and apologized and brought our food out 15 mins later. I ordered vegetarian dish and she comes out with non-veg dish. At this point I'm furious and asked for the food to be waived. Our server calls the owner and he said, \"I don't serve free food to my own parents\". Denied to give us free food after the whole hoopla and time that was wasted. Me and my husband used to be huge fan and even though my food was served with hair in it once and i let that go BUT this made it all WORST! The owner doesn't know how to treat customer. Do not waste your time and money!!!",

The food at Tandoori Times is just more flavorful than it is at many other Indian restaurants in Phoenix, and I believe the ingredients are of a better quality.  I do wish they had slightly more vegetarian options here, and I really wish they had pakoras on the appetizer list -- but other than that, I can't complain. And, while I like the place, my husband absolutely loves it, especially their lamb dishes. Also, I have to admit, I'm emotionally attached to this place as my husband and I had the rehearsal dinner for our wedding here last October. They were able to pull it together for us with only a few weeks notice (our other selection had flaked out on us at the last minute). They were really accommodating when we were running late that night, and even started bringing out appetizers to our guests who got there before us (it was supposed to be a buffet, but they were thoughtful enough to improvise). Everyone loved the food, from the meat-and-potatoes Midwestern uncles to the Indian aunties, so that says a lot right there... also, their outside patio is lovely.",

I spent a few years in the Bay Area, where I became accustomed to tasty hole in the wall Indian food joints rich with sauces and flavors. The only thing they typically lacked, though, was presentation. The restaurants were often uncomfortable or dirty but, in spite of that, the food made it worth the trip.   Tandoori Times is unique. First of all, there is very little quality Indian food in the Phoenix metro, so that alone sets it apart. On top of that, its appeal is radically different from what I experienced around SF. This place is clean and cool, with sleek decor and comfortable booths to boot. The naan was fantastique, and the food was almost as good, but not quite. The richness and abundance of flavors weren't quite as present as with their slightly grosser counterparts in Cali.   Not cheap, but, then again, hard to come by. I'll be headed back the next time I start feeling the need for some Tandoori chicken and naan.",

    "text": "We started with Aloo Tikki. It was good but I don't like one of the spices in the garbanzo beans, The Aloo Tikki last week in West Palm, Fla, was infinitely better. I had chicken korma which again had that taste I am not too keen on, similar to nutmeg or cloves, which I have not noticed in any korma I have ever had previously. The korma sauce was very thick and I liked it but it was much thicker than the usual korma sauce in most other places and although it was good and certainly quite different, I think I prefer the usual consistency. But it is nice to have something different for a change. The onion naan was possibly a little underdone and slightly doughy, though it too was good and i suspect it was not so much underdone as that this is the way it is served at this restaurant. What was over was taken home and certainly thoroughly enjoyed the next day so it's fair to say I would recommend this restaurant.   My chief complaint would be the noise. When we walked in we were pleased to see that there were many Indian customers, always a good sign in an Indian restaurant. But it was noisy and the most noise came from a crying baby. This is not the baby's fault - I wish people with very young children would have the decency to do what I did when my kids were young... leave them at home!! Many people say that if you can't afford to leave at least a 15% - 20% tip then you can't afford to eat out. I think if you can't afford to find a babysitter so you can enjoy your evening and in particular so you can NOT spoil the evening for others, then PLEASE stay home. As usual, the people with the baby were impervious to its crying, they were obviously so accustomed to it that it does not bother them. I am not sure whether to hold this against the restaurant. they could have asked the people to take the baby outside until it settled, but it was cold outside and I wouldn't want to make them do that to the kid. It's a difficult situation for the resaurant but if I go again and the same thing happens again I will mark it down as a family restaurant and keep away when I don't want to deal with the noise of babies crying.",

It is a friday night and it was not that busy for a friday night so I don't understand why such bad service. The saddest thing was that the server said one of our items was given to another party because another server picked it up, but then the waiter never came to tell us excuse me sorry we made a mistake, I am taking care of it. Instead, he brought the item at the end when we were ready to leave. There was belly dancing, but we didn't enjoy it because the rest of our experience was below average. The server rarely came to check on us. This place has amazing decor and ambiance and its too bad it was ruined by the service and quality of food. They were also selling indian clothing at the entrance which looked really pretty. Its unfortunate it turned out to be a bad experience here. I usually login here to give excellent review, I believe this is my first absolutely horrific experience. Bland food, bad service, blaming the customer, not taking responsibility, this summarizes our night.",

    "text": "Since everyone in my family digs Tandoori Times, I've wandered in for eight or nine earlybird dinners and, honestly, I'm a little underwhelmed.  Definitely not bad or awful, but maybe if I sandwiched a later supper  between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of Kingfishers, I'd stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression.    Nothing I've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit. Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlic naan, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic.     I was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing.  Companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild.   Servers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody's overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening. It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe.    I do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that.    The atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars. In my book, Tandoori Times is just OK.",

She enjoys Indian food and wherever we have lived in the past we have found great indian restaurants able to make her dishes without all the kick.  We went here to check it out and she ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and couldn't eat it because of how spicy it was.   The manager told her he couldn't make it less potent or else the taste would be sacraficed.  Well, how did the other Indian restaurants outside of Phoenix manage to do it?  Not impressed at all with this place and won't be going back.",

Going thru the buffet the food wasn't too appetizing visually, it looked as tough nobody had even stirred it  to make it look appetizing, tho there was no one in the restaurant but 2 other tables. The naan was cold in one of the  chafing dishes which I mentioned to the  waiter, he later told me that it should be warm but it never did get warm. Frankly I'm used to having warm Naan delivered right to the table fresh. I wasn't quite sure if the food was even at a temperature so that one wouldn't get sick.   When we ask for a check the bill was different than what we were quoted and we asked the waiter and he said oh sorry I made a mistake I gave you  the weekday price and said sorry. I paid the bill , I would never recommend this restaurant and would never ever come back it's a shame that the people that own it are  not in charge of the restaurant even on a week-end afternoon.",

Now, never mind that the overpriced single dish indian entrees are mediocre at best ... for some reason a sword wielding candle balancing bellydancer is supposed to make for a good experience?   It was loud as hell inside, and then the bellydancing made any conversation entirely inaudible to the point where i had to ask my 'server' what he said numerous times. Now aside from letting children play with a massive sword by other guests, balancing candles on her head, and harassing patrons to get up and dance with her, the bellydancing was not only dangerous but unnecessarily noisy.  The food itself? Meh. Ive been to many indian places, this is the least impressive. But hey, we got to wait an extra hour before paying a $60 bill for 2 people.",

In my humble opinion, basmati rice should be included when ordering an entree dish with sauce, papadum is also something that should be complimentary, as this is the ONLY Indian food restaurant I've ever been to that doesn't offer it. Being cheap isn't a good quality for a restaurant to have.  Booths, tables and patio seating available, average noise level, basic ambiance.  I will return for the food only. Perhaps take out is a good option. Hope they rethink their add ons.",

I was also surprised to see all of the negative reviews about service, because in my experience, it has always been decent.    Really, I have only one complaint: While the belly dancer is clearly talented and very likable (she's great and bringing in the crowd), the music/ cymbals during the performance are so loud to the point where you cannot hear the people at your own table. I think it's really cool that they have belly dancing performances, I just wish that not paying full attention to them were a possibility.",

Their staff, Bobbi and Joel, were really kind and helpful. They know the menu in and out and Joel had great suggestions. I had the Chicken Korma and it was perfect. Recommend getting an order of Naan- plain and pesto were really good. Also a must have is their delicious basmati rice. Oh, and don't forget to get a Mango Lassi- they're really tasty. Another great thing is that their happy hour is from 5-7 and they have a great selection of well priced drinks.  It's pretty challenging to find this location- it's on the north west corner of via Ventura and Hayden road. Google maps has it wrong. PERSEVERE IT'S WORTH IT!!!!",

    "text": "Tandoori Times is one of the newer Indian restaurants to sprout up in the Valley, and they've decided to be a bit different. Nestled within Old Town Scottsdale, the friendly, affable owner knows that in order to succeed, his restaurant has to be both A) good and B) entertaining. \r \r The ambiance of the place is definitely a step up from most Indian joints. He has several booths semi-enclosed by see-through fabric and a full stocked bar. The food is pretty good - the naan is so far the best by miles I've had in the Phoenix metro. However, I noticed that they skimp on the meat & chicken dishes. Not wise, my friend, for your brown patrons DO notice that amidst all the tasty gravy there's like two meat nuggets and not much else. Given that the dishes here are at least a couple more dollars expensive than elsewhere, the skimping is kind of inexcusable.\r \r But hey! If you're there on Friday or Saturday nights, there's a belly dancer! Because that's the first thing we all think of when we go eat Indian food: a girl belly dancing to Bollywood soundtracks! Kickass.\r \r In all seriousness, Tandoori Times is a good, clean place and a step up from most other Indian restaurants in the Valley. But prepare to shell out more duckets, even though your carnivorous cravings may be lost while swimming through all that gravy.",

It was very busy, which was promising.  The waitress was on her second day working there and was unfamiliar with the menu, but she was friendly.    The house salad was mediocre, the entree (Algoo Gobi) was delicious, but the desserts were AWFUL.  The \"mango\" ice cream was a neon orange and tasted nothing like mango, or any flavor of ice cream Id ever tasted actually (kinda vanilla, kinda puke).  YUCK.  The rice pudding was not worth eating either.    The worst part of the experience was being followed out into the parking lot, after leaving the Groupon and cash tip, to be told that we needed to come speak with management about not ordering at least $40 worth of food!  Really?  I told the waiter that we had spent just over $30, and we obviously didn't expect any cash back from the $40 Groupon.  He said his manager was \"fussy\" and wouldn't like it.  I basically told him that was too damn bad, and that I wasn't ordering $10 more in food; I was actually kinda saving them $10!   He finally figured out what I was saying and left us alone.  I did end up calling the manager though, who was not pleased to hear about our experience with the dumb waiter.   I don't foresee returning there.",

After seeing a write up on Chow Bella I decided that I'd take the plunge! It was SO worth the chance.. totally clean, super friendly staff, great drinks and delicious food! We ordered heavy to cross section the menu.. not one dish sucked out of the 7 dishes that we ordered. The rice pudding made certain parts of me stand on end.. it was that good!

We were there just after opening on a Sunday.  There was only one other table occupied, yet service was pretty poor.  Undoubtedly the kitchen was extremely slow, but the server was not much better.  As for the food, same great flavor I remember for the most part.  The chicken vindaloo should have been called potato vindaloo, however.  Very little chicken was to be found.  Also, the garlic on the naan was extremely bitter.  As the naan was slightly charred, I assume the garlic had slightly burned.  The price point on both the naan and rice seemed a little high (I believe it was $2.75 for the naan and a similar amount for a small cup of rice).  Charging for rice seems overkill here.  The entrees are not that cheap to begin with.  It's the old charging for chips & salsa debate I guess.  Overall, an average meal, but I'm hoping it was an off day.  Will try again sometime.",

There was hardly five spoons of curry in each serving! And naans were small too. So we had to order another portion of both, which ofcourse sends the final bill up the roof!

Chicken Korma has always been a favorite and is usually what I order as a comparison the first time I try a new Indian restaurant.

    "text": "This is a really nice restaurant with good ambiance and a lovely patio, but the food and service merit a few bits of critique.  - Papadums & chutneys: you have to order and pay for these here, which is bizarre because they are typically served complimentary. They're basically the \"chips and salsa\" of Indian restaurants, so it always kills me when I actually have to pay for them. The Papadums are lovely here, but the chutneys are lacking. The typical mango and yogurt chutneys are not served here, which I find odd. The tamarind (which you have to request) is like coloured water, instead of thick in substance and rich in flavour. The achaar is definitely unique, in that's it's lemon-based instead of lime, but I personally prefer the lime.   - Curry: I ordered the chicken tikka masala, chef-hot. It was surprisingly spicy tonight! The last time I came here and ordered the same spice level, it was insipid and terribly mild. I guess it's hit-or-miss, eh?   Also, the chicken did not look or taste like chicken tikka, which is traditionally prepared with small pieces of boneless chicken baked on skewers in a clay oven (tandoor). It didn't have the charcoal-look or taste, which was disappointing. I also had bits of gristle and bone, which should be nonexistent in chicken tikka!   FYI: None of the curries come with rice. Another oddity. You must order it separately.  - Garlic naan: brilliant. But you can't really screw that one up.   - Service: friendly staff, but slow service. Make sure you have plenty of time when you dine here. Everything seems to take ages, even when they're not busy. It's severely annoying when your stomach is full of curry and rice and all you want is your check and they take 20 minutes getting it to you. Especially when they're not even busy.   All in all, this place sufficed my Indian craving, but it's definitely not the best or most authentic in any aspect.",

    "text": "I came here for lunch on the weekend. We had the option of a lunch buffet or menu items. We opted for the buffet since we wanted to sample their items. Pricing was a little higher than the typical Indian buffets to which I'm accustomed. It was shy of $17 per person. They had maybe 10 food items available for tasting, and I was disappointed by how it was managed. There wasn't much food in the trays and essentially we were left digging in the sauce for food. Service at the table was good but that didn't compensate for the service at the buffet. The restaurant is small and quaint. I will definitely be back to try the menu items.",

I asked my waiter how spicy the dish I was going to get was and he said mild but when I tried it, it did not taste like mild. Luckily he gave me another dish that wasn't too spicy and didn't charge me for two dishes. However, my friends and I were tricked into buying naan bread! The waiter asked if we wanted some and he didn't mention that we had to pay for it, we assumed it was a free dish that you get before your meal! Overall it was not bad, they had belly dancing when we were there and it was very cool!",

We went here for my birthday (didn't tell the staff) and it wasn't just really, really good food but great service and a belly dancer who comes on at 7:30 (at least, on Saturday nights). I particularly liked the cocktail I had--I think it was lasse with vodka and juice, normally I would have ordered an Indian beer but it *was* my birthday.  For appetizers, we had popadom and raita. For the meal, my BF chose tandoori chicken and I had a prawn curry. We shared rice and potato-stuffed naan. We were too stuffed for dessert but did enjoy the chai tea setup.  They have a happy hour everyday from 5 -7. I'll be back!",

    "text": "First, this restaurant is very difficult to find even if you know the unit number as the various buildings do not have distinctive markings on them.  We did finally find the restaurant and asked the hostess as we were seated if we would be able to be served and eat within an hour as we were attending a concert afterwards. We were told that would not be a problem.  Service proved to be very slow. After 15 minutes a server took our order and we ordered only entrees but requested papadums to eat while we waited. After another 15 minutes had passed I asked our server when he would bring our papadums. He said that he thought we wanted them with our entrees. Now I have been eating in Indian restaurants most of my life and papadums have always been treated as an appetizer to be eaten before the entree. So the papadums arrived after another 5 minutes. After another 10 minutes had passed we had still not received our entrees and I explained that we were now at a point where we would not have time to eat if we were to get to our concert on time. The entrees finally arrived after 50 minutes in the restaurant just as some very loud music kicked in and a belly dancer appeared!!!! By this time our patience was exhausted and I said that because we had so little time left and the loud music we needed to leave. I offered to pay for the meals that we would not eat and was told that was not necessary.  Our treatment at this restaurant was beyond awful and I would not recommend eating here under any circumstances.",

Even the little interaction I have with people over the phone seem to indicate that service isn't that great.  That being said, I'm a firm believer that bad service should never stop you from enjoying good food, especially when it's this good!  If you're new to Indian food and want something other than Chicken Tikka, try their vindaloo. We always get lamb, but I'm sure the chicken is great as well if you're not a fan of lamb.  The thing that really makes this dish is the potatoes.  Oh my gad.  They completely absorb the flavours of the sauce and just melt in your mouth.  Wing lovers, you HAVE to get the tandoori wings.  A squeeze of lemon is a must, as it brings out the smokiness of the grill.    If you want to avoid meat, they have plenty of vegetarian options.  My boyfriend's favorite vegetarian dish is their Malai Kofta - huge veggie dumplings cooked in a creamy tomato sauce.  Apparently this is a really hard dish to get right, and theirs knocks it out of the park.  This is a restaurant my boyfriend would take his Indian mother to - a True testament to how great everything tastes.  Highly recommend!",

We arrived and I asked right away what the process was for redeeming the Groupon...did they want the voucher now or when the check arrives.  The nice server said, \"Now is ok\", and I opened the app on my iPhone and she wrote down the number.  She handed my phone back to me, and I showed her that I was going to press the Redeemed button.  No problem!  My friend and  I ordered drinks:  a mango lassi and a diet coke.  The server brought the drinks, and my friend and I continued to make small talk and look over the menu.  Suddenly, the server and a manager were back at the table.  \"There's a problem with the Groupon.  When we try to enter the number, it says it's been redeemed.\"  No kidding!!!  I just redeemed it in front of the server!  The server then apologized because it was her first day, and the manager kept saying, I'm sorry.  I can't apply the Groupon without the Groupon being active.  Then he went on to say that I should call Groupon and have them reactivate this and not to worry because this has happened before...um...is Groupon going to take care of this right now?  I don't think so.  I just wanted to ask at this point...AND THIS IS YOUR CUSTOMER'S FAULT BECAUSE....?????  So there I had pressed the redeemed button in good faith in front of the server so that she wouldn't get in trouble (I've had people thank me at other places because they forgot to ask me to do this, so I just do it now in front of them...ease of anxiety cuz who needs THAT, right?), and I'm now being told by the manager that we'll have to pay cash because he has no recourse with regard to processing the promotion.  GOOD management would have apologized for their establishment's mistake and then filed a claim with Groupon themselves.  but not here.  ...and the very LEAST he could have done was comp'd our drinks!!!!  I think that tab was about $5.  ANY attempt at concession might have led me to just stay, order a meal and work it out later...but I was furious at this point.  WORK IT OUT, BUD!  It's what you get paid for.  Did I mention that our booth was one of TWO occupied when we were seated before this fiasco?   Management here needs to \"buy a vowel\" before I  would even consider coming back to this place.  GOOD customer service can make ALL the difference when dealing with the general public.  This establishment has, obviously, yet to learn that.",

I had the goat curry which was their Friday special, and it was wonderful.  My husband who doesn't like most curry dishes stuck with the tandoori chicken which was wonderful as well. A side of pesto naan rounded the meal out.  No complaints about the food at all.  The bad: the service.  Our waiter was very polite and friendly the few times we saw him.  He brought us menus and then left us waiting for 15 minutes before coming back to take our order.  He then disappeared for most our meal. We had to ask another server to track him down to get our bill.  Needless to say our drinks were not refilled.  We also waited a very long time for our food.  The ugly: the belly dancing.  Actually it wasn't the bellydancing. More specifically the dramatic rise in music and the incessant finger chimes of the dancer grew to be irritating.  The dancing was fun to watch in the beginning but became tiresome after first few minutes.  It was impossible to chat without shouting at my husband.  Good place. Prices were reasonable and the food was good. But the service needs some work.",

Don't let the idea of  exotic food scare you away...there's something for everyone here, even vegetarians and children!  Try the paneer (pressed cheese) dishes or samosas choley if you don't like meat.  Try the chicken or paneer Makhani if you don't like the heat!  For medium-spicy dishes, the Chicken Tikka Masala is excellent with a side of rice and naan bread!  If you want a bite of something that'll bite you back with a really great flavor, try the Tandoor Fish wrap!  The key to eating reasonably is to go as a group of 2 or more, get rice and naan and a couple different items to share with the entire table.  You don't have to drink alcohol, but there's a full service bar at all 3 of the Tandoori Times locations and the beer selection is above-average!  This is the original location and offers a great, semi-upscale atmosphere and a nice patio complete with hookah!  Bellydancers join the fun on Friday and Saturday nights.  Decent value if you crave very good quality food, an exotic atmosphere and an authentic Indian experience.  Ok, the bellydancing isn't exactly authentic, but it's definitely exciting!  One of my favorite weekend hangouts...solid 5 out of 5!",

If kids have to eat - whatever is on the menu is not good enough in my book.",

    "text": "I am remiss in not writing my review of our dinner Tandoori Times a little sooner. In my defense, my ears hadn't stopped ringing from the background music for the belly dancer and I was unable to concentrate on the screen long enough to write a coherent sentence (at least I think that's why I can't write a coherent sentence:) The Beautiful Carin and I met the utterly delightful Jim and Audrey W. for dinner at Tandoori Times last Friday evening. I keep saying it, but one of the things I like about Yelp is actually meeting and getting to know real people in \"meat world\", as opposed to only getting to know someone online. It really gets down to the art of dining...pleasant conversation with convivial company, good food and drink, in an interesting setting.  We had all of those things Friday evening, and more! We also had Indian food at Tandoori Times!  I love Indian and Pakistani food.  I play squash and I got to know Indian and Pakistani food from the kitchens of the wives of some of my squash buddies...incredible meals and incredible hospitality...we could all take lessons:) We started with cocktails, 4 kinds of Naan (the Onion Naan was incredible...crusty and crunchy on the outside, literally filled with chunks of soft, savory/sweet roasted onion:) Appetizers included Aloo Tikki, a potato pancake with gravy (and you know how much I like gravy:)...good stuff. We passed things around, family style. We ordered dinner as we enjoyed our conversations.  It was great to get to know Jim and Audrey better and I'm glad we had some time to chat as dinner was served (really wonderful food...Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Masala, Lamb Korma and Kahari Shrimp...everything perfectly prepared, spicy and flavorful).  The service was warm and friendly:) All of the food was served family style with rice and more Naan to sop up the gravies and sauces...so good! Then came the belly dancing and music...there may also have been a fire engine parade and a Boeing 777 landing in the parking lot...it was so loud we'll never really know.  The sound system was really cranked for the lovely belly dancer and it was fun to watch  her for the first 15 minutes or so.  But after an hour or so, the fun of watching belly dancing kind of wore off, we wanted to get back to conversation (even though the belly dancer was brandishing swords and candles...it was a little like watching NASCAR...you don't want to see the wreck, but you don't want to miss it either. I'm happy to report that nothing was cut off or burned during the performance:) Sadly, conversation was rendered nearly impossible by the fact that someone had turned the amplifiers up to 11. Jim would ask me \"what do you do for a living\" and I would answer \"I sold my motorcycle in 1978\", with a smile, and he would look puzzled:) Audrey and Carin were having similar difficulties...it's just hard to have quiet chat when the background music is up around 107 decibels:) That said, we truly enjoyed the evening with our new friends! And we really enjoyed the food at Tandoori Times...I just recommend calling ahead to ask about the belly dancing, and bring the ear plugs if you go on belly dancing nights:)",

    "text": "I went to Tandoori Times today for lunch with six of my co-workers for lunch. It was not the best Indian food I've had, but it was definitely not the worst (I had the achari lamb lunch special). But my experience there was horrible.  My issue with Tandoori Times was the service. Our waitress did not seem to care about our table at all, even though we were the largest party in the place. Maybe she felt that she did not need to work for her tip since it was automatically added to our bill.   She never checked on us to see if we needed anything. One of our party members even had to chase her down just find out where his food was after everyone else's food had shown up 10 minutes before.  She had issues with our check and stiffed us on our change. I bill was $97. Three people put in $20, another a $10, and three people asked her to charge $17 a piece on their credit cards. That totals $121.00. We asked for change from the cash. SHE CAME BACK WITH NO CHANGE AND WALKED AWAY. As we were already 30 minutes late from lunch and were in a hurry we left, but she swiped a $24.00 tip.  Even though the food was good, the service was the worst I think I've ever had. I will not be returning to this restaurant any time soon.",

    "text": "My belief has always been that at a restaurant, nothing matters but the food.  Service can be abysmal as long as the food is good.  Tandoori Times has changed my beliefs about this, and I now realize that service can be so amazingly terrible that it can completely ruin a dining experience.  Dinner started innocently enough.  We sat at a table not far from the bar, and our server started out asking us what we'd like to drink.  The server had a young kid with her, maybe 5-6 years old, and the kid was helping her with things.  I thought it was kind of strange, but I assumed it was probably our server's kid and that she couldn't find a babysitter for the night or something - no big deal.  I ordered a dirty martini, and our server went back to the bar to mix our drinks (she told us the bartender had already gone home for the night, even though it was only 6PM).  Since our table was near the bar, we could hear what was going on there, and within a minute or two, I heard the server asking the rest of the staff if they knew where the olive juice was.  After a minute or two of searching, the staff concluded that they were out of olive juice.  At this point, I expected our server to come back and ask if she could get me a different drink.  She didn't.  Instead, she started asking the staff what she could substitute for olive juice, and they concluded that saltwater would be good.  Ugh.  She brought me the drink and pretended it was completely normal and nothing was wrong.  I pretended I didn't know any better, took a sip of the drink, and told her it was beyond awful and it tasted like they had used salt instead of olive juice.  She acted like she couldn't imagine why this was, and she said that she would take the drink off of my bill.  When she picked the drink up from the table to take it away, the young kid I mentioned earlier bumped into her and knocked the drink out of her hand.  She spilled a bit of it on me, and most of it on the floor.  She then walked away and offered no help of any kind - no napkins or anything.  This spilled drink stayed on the floor _the entire rest of the meal_, and they never cleaned it up.  When we eventually left, I was tempted to \"slip\" on it, pretend I severely hurt myself, and start yelling about how careless their staff was, how they could be held liable for injuries, blah blah blah.  I just wanted someone to recognize that it was ridiculous for them to not clean up things that they had spilled, but it really seemed like they didn't care at all.  Anyway, the server asked if I wanted something else to drink instead.  I went for a gin and tonic.  When she got back to the bar, the first thing I heard was \"What's in a gin and tonic? How do I make one?\" Sigh.  Anyway, the gin and tonic turned out okay, all things considered, but at this point I was pretty sad from what had already happened.  Finally, we got to ordering our food.  Our server came over, asked what we'd like, and as we started telling her, we noticed she wasn't paying any attention.  She was just watching her kid and talking to her.  So, we got to repeat our order again, and this time she actually paid attention and wrote it down.  Yay.  Awhile later, our food came out - we got two naans (one paneer, one chicken), chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, and rice.  The naans were pretty average, nothing really special.  The chicken tikka masala was actually pretty good, and was the only decent part of the whole meal.  The palak paneer was some of the worst I've ever had, and I'm pretty sure they just emptied a defrosted bag of frozen spinach over some cubes of paneer.  It tasted like no spices or any kind of flavoring had been added.  In the middle of eating, we were interrupted by the server and her kid for a rather awkward moment.  The server made her kid apologize for knocking over my drink, and then they walked away.  Congratulations Tandoori Times on making our dinner that much more uncomfortable.  Our server didn't seem to care about anything throughout the whole meal - she never asked how anything was, if we needed anything, etc. When we were done eating, she came by and dropped off the check, without removing our plates from the table or even saying a word.  We had been charged an extra $2.50 just to have rice with our entrees, which I think is pretty ridiculous.  Anyway, I took out my credit card and she came by to pick it up, again without saying a word.  We left quickly, wanting to get our Tandoori Times experience over with as soon as possible.  When we left, I was pretty frustrated and angry, which is not how one should feel when leaving a restaurant.  I will never, ever, ever come back here again.",

    "text": "We went here for dinner a couple of days back for a celebration. We first chose to sit at a booth. Those seats were incredibly uncomfortable, the back rests are too thick which makes the seat really small, so we moved to a table. We started with an appetizer -- aloo tikki, which was good, but the chutneys could have been more flavorful. We had baingan bharta (eggplant) which was pretty much burnt and panneer tikka masala which was normal. The breads were good (but the aloo naan was too thick in my opinion) and the veg briyani was pretty ok-ish. The lassis were not bad. While we were waiting for our food, there was a big party with a kid who was just let loose and was running from one table to another. Before we could realize what was happening, he just threw up next to us. His parents were least bothered and just wiped him up, continued eating and the kid got back to running. We were disgusted to say the least and the waiter moved us to another table. But even after they cleaned up the mess, we could smell vomit throughout the time we were there. They should have used a strong disinfectant, i strongly suspect they used only water to clean it. So anyway, we lost our appetite, ate very little, skipped dessert and took the rest of the food home. With mediocore food and bad ambience, our experience wasn't all that good. One star for the service, one star for the panneer dish.",

    "text": "An Indian coworker of mine who was craving a little Chicken Tikka Masala suggested that we check this place out after yelping it, so we headed over one night after work. It was a little hard to find as others have mentioned, but we got there in the end, so no harm, no foul.   A lot of my recent Indian food experiences have been in strip malls, which are about as disasterous as they sound, so I was so thrilled to be able to go, sit down and enjoy my Indian food properly. And enjoy it, I did!  My coworkers and I started off with the Bread Basket, which our waiter kindly let us mix n' match: we weren't thrilled about the wheat naan, so he let us switch it out for an extra helping of the onion, garlic or plain naan....yippee! All of the naans were great...the onion was probably the one that thrilled me the least, but it's hard to go wrong with naan of any variety, so needless to say that when our food was gone, the naan was as well.  For our entrees, we ended up going family style and sharing four dishes (for three people): the Chicken Biryani, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Makhani and Lamb Vindaloo. They were ALL great...I would order any of them again. But, if I had to choose my favorite, it would be the Chicken Makhani. I REALLY appreciate that they use white, good quality chicken...one of the keys to great Indian food, in my opinion! The Chicken Tikka Masala was also wonderful as well, but spicier than the Makhani. As for the Lamb Vindaloo and the Chicken Biryani, they didn't do it for me quite like the first two but I really have no complaints about them, and devoured them in no time.   The service wasn't super-quick, but we'll be back. After a great meal, we all agreed that this place could easily become a weekly dining excursion, especially since they have frequent diner cards!! Every time you're there, they put a certain percentage of what you spend on the card, and then you can use it on any future meal. That's fabulous! It's like free money...what's not to love?!",

I drank a King Fisher (Indian beer) and it was pretty good, better than most American bottled beers. Mango lassi was good, as it is in most places.   PRICE: It's about $9-13 for each dish, and $3 for naan.   ATMOSPHERE: Decently nice restaurant, not very much Indian decor. The music can get a little too loud. Right when I jokingly said, \"A belly dancer should come out and dance to this music,\" one actually freakin did. A white one. It was entertaining and awkward. But when a little girl went to dance like the belly dancer, that was hilarious. I swear that little kid danced for an hour straight.   SERVICE: The waiter, who I've seen at campus multiple times, was helpful and polite.   SKINNY: This is the best Indian restaurant I've been to in the phoenix area.

Sometimes I go here on my lunch breaks and other times for dinner. They do hookah on the weekends outside and belly dancing on Friday and Saturday evenings. My favorite meal is the Goa Prawn curry extra spicy, with garlic nahn. I've tried the chicken, goat, beef, and shrimp. The jasmine rice is terrific and a great compliment to your meal. The food isn't greasy and they do a great job with spices and seasoning. There are not a lot of Indian food locations in the valley, but this one is by far my favorite. The location is hidden on top of the plaza, easiest way to access it is by driving to the top level of the parking garage. You will always have great parking if you enter from this point. In fact, you should always park here because it's just easy! Check it out, great for dates or family's. The belly dancing is cool and the hookah is a relaxing occasional treat. I'll update with pictures next time I go. If you have a pallet for ethnic food or wanting to expand your horizons try this place out. A+!!!",

They also have this mango drink that is amazing! I have to have one every time I go.  Such a yummy place to eat!  Gosh even writing this review makes me want to go again. It doesn't get much better if you're looking for good food.",

    "text": "Its hard for me to give this restaurant a higher star rating. This is not due to the food by any means. The food is excellent and very genuine. I do however, take issue with the service. Everyone is pleasant enough, but none of the wait staff or take out order employees seem to have any concept of time. I have dined in at the restaurant for lunch a couple of times with other colleagues. We have a typical hour lunch break and this establishment is a mere 5 mins away. Lets just say both times we told the server we would be in a hurry due to work and both times we were at least 20 to 30 minutes late. Lesson learned. So we resorted to calling in our order for pick up. We were told it would be ready in 10 mins.   That was a sheer fabrication as both times we arrived and paid and waited for another 30 minutes for our food at the pick up window. (AKA bar). Now, why do we keep giving them another chance? Well, that's simple, it is the only authentic indian food in a 10 mile radius. Trust me, if we had other options we'd take them.   Bottom line: Great Food! Crap Service!",

    "text": "Oh man this was good indian food. Coming from a native, I hope this means something!  Another restaurant close to my hotel so I decided to try it out on my way back (ate at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant last night) to the room. Seating confused me at first because the sign said seat yourself but there was also a host directing people to tables. Whatever...  Pretty extensive menu. I ordered the beef seekh kabab wrap and the butter chicken with rice and a plain naan. Kind of annoying that none of the curries come with rice or naan (and rice is 2.50, 1.75 for a plain naan). Luckily I was on the expense account so I didn't care about the cost too much. Food took a while to come out, but there was also a large party ahead of me which got served first. The kabab wrap consisted of a monster thick kabab, nothing wimpy like some other restaurants to with the usual accompaniments.   The butter chicken was thick and creamy and the serving dish was filled to the brim (almost overflowing). There was a decent amount of chicken in there, definitely not skimpy like many other restaurants. It tasted delicious and no one seasoning was overpowering. The portion was pretty big and between the kabab wrap and the butter chicken, two people could easy have eaten and been satisfied.   Overall delicious food and pretty good service. They don't really have a full bar (as they advertise), there are maybe 10 spirits with a few mixers, and beer. I didn't imbibe, but the selection was pretty standard fare (rum, scotch, tequila, vodka) and looked decently priced (at least according to the drink menu).",

Only 2 waiters working during lunch rush made service very slow, took 2 hours for lunch when it should take no more than 45. Food quality is good, but during lunch people just want to get in and out quickly. During dinner this would be a good place for a sit-down meal. I feel prices are a bit higher than other comparable places.",

My son loved it and it was a nice gesture.  But sadly that doesn't stop me from writing this review. Sad because I really loved this restaurant in the past and had great time here. The food today was horrible. The only saving grace were the tandoori chicken. They were decent. The chicken biryani was so bad, I wanted to personally take the chef to other Indian restaurants and taste how a biryani should actually taste in terms of flavour, aroma, consistency and meat quality. It was at best a badly made pulav. The curry that we ordered, dal makhani was equally bad. For some strange reason, it tasted like the Madras Bites lentil pack you get in Costco or other grocery stores. When you pay premium, you expect quality food.  I am disappointed! Won't be going there again.",

    "text": "The food is great! My boyfriend and I overindulged in delicious garlic naan, paneer tikka masala (a little too creamy for my taste), and the daily special. The wine was alright but was served way too warm.   Unfortunately the service was not so pleasant. Our waitress in the beginning was less than friendly. She asked if I wanted a drink and I said, \"I'm not sure yet...can...\" and she walked away before I could ask for a wine menu. We tried to flag her down a few times but she kept storming past us. It wasn't busy enough to be treated this way. Finally we went to the bar and got our own menu.   I was waving the menu in my face because it was gruesomely hot in the restaurant. Beads of sweat were dripping down my neck. My wine was warm. My water was warm. They cranked up the music to a point where I couldn't hear anything else going on and brought out the belly dancer.   Shortly after we began eating, it felt like I was on a bad acid trip. It was hot. The music was way too loud. And then, like a bad dream, a man passed out and fell on the floor. Fortunately there was a doctor there to administer care. The paramedics were called and the man was thought to have heat exhaustion. It's no wonder! It was a billion degrees in there.   The waitress was slightly nicer after that incident, but then ended up trying to get us to pay for another person's tab because she accidentally had them pay for ours. There is no sense in why she couldn't have just voided it and owned her mistake. We ended up paying $68 when we should have only paid $53. She had \"discounted it\" 15% but regardless we still paid $15 extra!  I'm not disappointed with this restaurant, just this waitress in particular. The food is great, but go for pickup so that you don't have to deal with the experience that we had on a Saturday Night.  UPDATE: tried this again as take out and paid $20 for a naan and tikka masala without rice. They didn't mention it didn't come with rice and I found it very off-putting as the meal we had on Saturday had rice. Also took quite a while for the order (45 min) but that's ok. It was a busy Sunday night.",

Spicy but not too spicy, flavorful but not too flavorful, and excellently paired with some rice and the awesome and highly recommended garlic naan. My partner had the coconut chicken curry and garlic and onion naan, which I had bites of and both were very very yummy.

It's kind of tucked in the back but there is plenty of parking near by. It was really cute - didn't look like your typical Indian restaurant. In fact, it looked more like a little American cafe with very minimal decor. We were seated immediately and noticed they had a belly dancer - always fun to watch! We took note there were a lot of Indian patrons enjoying dinner here (always a good sign).  We shared the Aloo Tikki (Potato patty served with garbanzo beans, onions, mint & tamrind chutney), Garlic & plain Naan bread, Mango Chutney, Chicken Masala (Base of onions, ginger garlic, and vine ripened tomatoes combined with chicken), Lamb Vindaloo (Lamb cubes cooked in a special vindaloo aromatic sauce with potatoes) & Chicken Vindaloo (Chicken cooked in special vindaloo aromatic sauce with potatoes). The food was very good and the Vindaloo had a serious kick to it so if you aren't into spicy curries you may want to have them tone it down. The thing I normally notice with Indian food is it can be on the salty side...not Tandoori Times though. The combination of fresh flavors and spice really was art like. Oh and the Mango Chutney was perfect - my British friends and I thought we had died and went gone to heaven.  The service was really good and our waiter had a great sense of humor. Gotta love service with a side of humor or sarcasm. :) We brought a birthday cake with us and to my surprise the restaurant didn't charge us that  stupid cake cutting fee. I hate it when restaurants charge for that. I can cut my own cake! The belly dancer was really good and as the boys said with a smile \"she's really flexible\". The only negative was the music was really loud and we weren't able to talk with out having to raise our voices.  Give it a go! It's delici.",

As we scanned the menu, I was disappointed to see that a large portion of their options were only available during lunch time: get separate menus so I'm happily oblivious to what I'm missing!   I am a chicken tikka masala girl through and through. While I may order other dishes in ADDITION to CTM, I *have* to get it at every Indian joint I go to. Yes, yes, I know it may not be the most authentic thing, but I don't care. I love it. So don't you dare try to talk me out of it! And that's exactly what our waiter did, which made me nervous. Was the CTM all that bad? No, it was fair, but the waiter's attempt to lead us down a different road makes me wonder if they really do have wonderful food here, it's just not CTM. Try it out, and go with their recommendations!",

We have enjoyed the food but on the last 2 visits the service was extremely slow.  Last time we thought maybe they are having a bad day, or short staffed or whatever.  Went today, August 5th for dinner.  Got there at 7pm, the place was not busy, only 4 or 5 tables were occupied.  We were seated right away and the excruciating wait started.  Our beer order took over 10 minutes to come, our appetizer order took another 20 minutes.  We placed our dinner order right away when the appetizers were served in order to minimize the wait but still ended waiting about 30 minutes after we finished our appetizers. We got there at 7pm and it nearly 9pm by the time we were able to leave.  Not going back till service improves.  They had a nice thing going; sad to see it going down the tube.  Response to Sunny. Our server was a male server. He was very pleasant but very slow.  May need some additional training.  Thank you.",

Besides feeling completely out of place in our Halloween costumes we had a great time;-) It's a pretty low key place and it sits towards the back of this shopping complex so unless you know where you're going you would never find it.   We had a great experience since my friend personally knows one of the owners. We sat on the patio and started off with drinks and hookah and we were given some great suggestions for food. I decided to go for the chili prawns and garlic naan and a side of the basmati and saffron rice. I'm still drooling thinking about this food, it was so fresh and flavorful, I couldn't stop eating!!! The sauce the prawns came in...MAN was it tasty!   After hookah, drinks and this delish food my girls and I got up danced a bit with the resident belly dancer inside of the restaurant! Overall it was a great experience, we felt like we were part of the family! Great service, great ambiance and perfect for dates or family night.   If I lived closer I would definitely be a regular!",

I used to live in the Bay Area of California, and I had some of the best Indian food while I was there, so I was a little skeptical that I would find something good here in Arizona.  My friend was right, the food here is awesome.  I liked the variety of naan that they had here, from plain to garlic to whole wheat.  We got the whole wheat, which soaked up the yummy goodness of the sauce that came with my lamb masala.  This dish was just spicy enough, very flavorful, and the lamb was super tender.  My friend is a veggie and got the dal makhani, which my carnivorous self actually found quite tasty.  And to top it all off, they had some chai tea that was out of this world.  It's a far cry from the sweetened chai stuff that you get at Starbucks, very flavorful.  The service here was very great and attentive.  I'm not sure how this place would be around the dinner hour, but for lunch we were seated quickly and served quickly as well despite quite a few people being there.  I can't wait to come back!",

I have been there twice for lunch. Both times my party had the same waitress, and both times she was so slooooowwwww. The second time she accidentally charged us for 2 instead of 4 chicken lunch specials. We were honest --  pointing out the undercharge. She proceeded to totally screw up the change (pocketing the $24 cash) and then overcharging the three debit cards as if we did not supply cash as well. If I did not know better I would have said she was blonde. Sheeshh.  They desperately need some sort of new ventilation system. It smells like all the smoke from the kitchen is not venting out correctly. The AC is way too cold. Several in my party were cold. And the bathrooms were gross. The food was tasty, but I'll pass on this one next time.",

I had asked for my masala to be spicy but there was no spice whatsoever! The garlic naan had so much garlic on it that it was like biting straight into raw garlic!!!!

    "text": "Alas, my craving for Indian food came to the point where I had to breakdown and eat Indian food on the West Coast. :(  I'm sorry to say that my craving for Indian was not met and the \"timing\" to eat at \"Tandoori Times\" couldn't have been worse.  To start off my first sign of disappointment was when I called to see if the had a lunch buffet  They didn't.  What Indian Restaurant doesn't do a lunch buffet!?  Well two to be in exact, which happens to be the only two Indian restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale (Tandoori Times and Jewel of the Crown) which is where I work, of course.  The cuisine...  First off, I'm a big believer that you can judge an Indian restaurant by their chicken tikka masala, so since this was my first visit to Tandoori, I had to try it.   Let's just say it was okay at best.  The tikka masala was little bit spicier than usual, which is fine with me, and it also had the right consistency and richness from the cream you expect, but it missed the slight sweetness that contrasts the spices from the sauce.  Disappointing.  Next was the naan.  The naan came out warm and had that ever so slight crispy outside that I adore, but the inside was slightly doughy or little too moist, which made the naan slightly chewy after it cooled off.  It was still good, but come on; you can at least master the basics right?  Wrong.  Let's go to the rice.  First and foremost I don't ever recall where you had to pay for rice at any Indian restaurant.  Well guess what?  I did.  $2.50 to be exact!!!  And for $2.50, did they master this staple side dish?  Noooo...  It wasn't like it was horrible but I have never had Indian rice that was oily; it was slight, but you could taste and feel it.  Overall texture and flavor was sub par, but I couldn't get over the slightly oily taste and texture.  All I could think was that I was eating Chinese fried rice (b/c of the oiliness) with my tikka masala.  Sigh... Oh well.  Atleast they gave a hearty portion.  Decor was adequate, dark green and red colored sheer covered sections of walls and was used a divider to break up the room.  But what was up with the standard white office acoustical tiles in the ceiling?  Atleast black it out like most restaurants.  I felt like I was at work or in some weird episode of The Office.  An episode when Steve Carell's character, Michael, decides to go to an Indian restaurant at lunch and notices the same thing...but to only make an erroneous comment out loud so everyone in the restaurant could here, starts mocking Indians and their accent and everything then goes down hill: something I would only laugh if on TV, but would not in real life.  I couldn't get over the fact that on top of that they had the audacity to then painted random acoustical tiles dark red and blue, which made your eyes look up at the ceiling.  I'm clueless on that one.  Anyways, I am very hard pressed to find a reason to go back Tandoori Times.  For all you Phoenicians you never had Indian Food, save your taste buds and go to NYC or anywhere back east and try it there.  But if you get the urge, I would suggest go to India Delhi Palace on McDowell Road.  The food is actually pretty good, for AZ standards that is.  More along the lines of 2 1/2 Stars",

The naan is so fresh and warm, and when you request spicy, that's what you get. Enter the mango lassi, which is really good. It helps cool your mouth when you're eating something fiery.  The only thing I have a complaint about are the tandoori appetizer wings, as there was less meat on them than I have seen on any chicken wing, plus it was WAY too spicy. I also felt like $10 was way too much to ask when you have to basically get your nutrition from the dish by sucking on bones. But, hey...who am I to judge, right? Had they toned the flavor just a bit on that dish, I might have given it another try. However, bleeding from my esophagus is not how I'd like to spend my lunch hour.   Aside from the wings from hell, I love Tandoori Times. It is authentic, affordable and right around the corner from my job. 4 stars.",

I ordered a beer and the waitress went to fetch it, along with four waters while the others chose their libation.  The waters arrived and we asked for menus.   The other drinks arrived and we asked for menus again. The menus arrived and we were able to concoct a delightfully aromatic meal that included Sunday's special of the day, Lamb Achari.  I was convinced to order medium spiciness. I should have gone with my gut and ordered one dish, hot. My mistake! Remember to order one hot spicy dish next time.  We had a garlic and onion naan for a change from garlic naan and the addition of onion was superb. We also ordered a Lacha Parantha to complement our dishes.   The Goa prawn curry was delightful and had great flavor. We also had vegetable korma and vegetable biryani to round out the meal.

My favorite was the goa prawns (the curry sauce was heavenly), but all the dishes had incredible flavor!   We could have ordered the lamb dish a tad hotter. Medium wasn't hot at all, so don't be afraid to notch it up a level or two here, especially if you like spicy   If you come during happy hour, you'll have $2 off the drinks, or you can have the free chai tea!  Super nice waitstaff, and we were greeted by a couple additional people as we left. I guess there is belly dancing on Friday and Saturday, which might be fun entertainment.",

We enjoyed it so much that we wanted to find a comparable restaurant here in the valley. Since we work right on the other side of the highway, we decided to head over to your place for lunch.  Not only were the dishes very tasty, they were a great size for the lunch menu. They weren't too big but they definitely weren't small by any means. Our service was great and once again the food was amazing. We can't wait to come back and try out your dinner service. Cheers!",

You get a hefty piece of the fluffiest naan ever, a half a dinner plate of rice, a cup of lentil soup, veggie \"salad\" and yogurt sauce. Not to mention a large portion of the actual chicken saag.   My experience here was religious. 15/5 stars.",

When you first enter there is a small display with various jewelry and clothing items for sale that you can check out while waiting to be seated.  We started with the garlic naan and the garlic and onion naan. They were so good ended placing a second order. We were a party of 6 so there were lots of dishes to try besides my own. I ordered the Malai chicken tikka but the chicken korma and the chicken,tikka masala were my favorites and the naan was wonderful dipped in their sauces. My husband had the tandoori wings which were tasty. They weren't nearly as spicy as they said they would be. They also brought out rice with the meals.  Everyone was very nice and the server was friendly but a little slow with drink refills.   The highlight of the evening was the belly dancer. She was wonderful and danced several numbers, including one with a sword on her head.",

The price point in the past was a little too high for us which made it a special-occasion-only restaurant... BUT...! The pricey buffet is gone (even though the dishes were all incredible) and replaced with a perfectly reasonable Daily Lunch Special menu with the same wonderful and exotic choices that would appear on the buffet. Each day offers a different array of fantastic dishes to try.   Yahoo! Thanks to the folks that run this restaurant for paying attention and making the right adjustments. May your business continue to flourish!",

Spending $30 for one dish with rice and one piece of naan used to be worth it because you basically got enough to have leftovers.  Not anymore.  I have never had such a small portion. Not even enough for one meal.  I also paid for a full size rice and got next to nothing.   Not worth it anymore. Super bummed out.",

We got paneer tikka, navratna korma, baingan bharta (eggplant), saag paneer, garlic and chilli naan and paneer naan with rice. Food did take a long time to come out which was a little weird to me since there were only two other tables filled. There is private parking lot. Would recommend eating here :)",

I ordered the nightly special.  It was called Chari lamb. I asked the server about it and he compared it to something like lamb vindaloo. The spice palate differs but it was a revelation. It was replete with crispy toasted cumin seeds in a spicy yoghurt-based sauce. I asked if the cook would spice it up a bit. Risky perhaps but it payed off. It's one of the best Indian meals I can remember. I paired the meal with a delicious mango lahssi. It was a great choice because it tempered the heat of the curry. I plan to come back soon.",

Honestly, it's more like a stripper dancing in front of you as your trying to have a nice romantic dinner with your boyfriend...what a treat! :P Go during the week to avoid the awkward dancer with abnormally loud music.

Def going to check that out next time. I really hope they have itty bitty sizes for me.  Food: Nan was overcooked, the bottom side was burnt.  Chicken Tikka Masala: seasoning, texture, and consistency of the dish was excellent.  Chicken was just a tad try but overall, great flavor. Would be more awesome if they sliced up the chicken into smaller cubes to give flavor consistency. Recommended esp for ppl who don't like spicy. Its very \"umami\" : ) I enjoy the creamy touch this place gives to it, shich distinguishes this place from other places.  Seasoned rice: came out warm, cooked just right  Samosas Choley: Non-spicy dish.  I eat it with the red sauce (spicy) to add a lili kick. The exterior was fried crispy just right, and the mashed potato inside were soft and warm.  Beans were very well seasoned and cooked, could tell they put time into it.  Methi Chicken: I tried this dish for the first time and I must admit I like it quite a bit. Ordered spicy. Have water prepared!

    "text": "Last night  I craved Indian food and logged on to Yelp for help. My very favorite place is 18 miles away and I wanted something nearby.  I found Tandoori Times and arrived there at 8PM.  I couldn't believe that at 8PM there were 10 people ahead of us waiting for a table. \" A good sign \"I thought or \"poor management that can't handle a crowd?\"  Someone who appeared to be the owner was busy working to see that everyone got a table quickly.  We got a table in 10 minutes in a small room they have in the rear of the restaurant.  Within 5 minutes we got a waitress and placed our order.  She brought us condiments (a red spicy sauce, coriander chili sauce and a spicy sauce made with marinated ginger bits.   No papadums.  Most restaurants give you papadums.  We missed them.  My order of Chicken Vindaloo was absolutely delightful spiced just as I requested HOT.  Our double order of bread came hot and delish(we don't eat rice).  My husband's Lamb Tikka was generous and nicely done.  During our meal, the belly dancer started her act.  This meant that the loud music would soon begin.  AND I MEAN LOUD.  I don't know if it was that we were in that small room, but my eardrums were about to burst.  There was no relief until we ended our meal.  The belly dancer could not be seen from our room so we stood up to peek at what was going on.  It was an attractive young lady, dressing in belly dancing garb dancing to Indian pop music.  Not really belly dancing.  (I've done belly dancing myself.)  Next, dessert.  I ordered the Kheer.  It was absolutely amazing.  It was creamy with sliced almonds and raisins.  Probably one of the best I've had anywhere.   I gave Tandoori Times 4 stars because the music was too loud and it kind of spoiled the experience for us.  Other than that the food is really authentic and delicious.  I hope that the management will consider toning down the music at least for the poor people in the back room.  I would never accept a seat in that room when I return.  AND, I will return.",

It really should not take an hour for food.  Meal was over two hours; no desert.  Sorry but wouldn't go back to find out if this was an aberration. The other reviews suggest its not.",

I tried this spot on my birthday because I really wanted indian food, but specifically because the website said they had belly dancing entertainment.  Drove all the way there to find out belly dancing only happens Friday and Saturday...bummer!   Ok so food...it was hella spicy and I like spicy food. But my children couldn't eat it. Everyting was one note of spicy so it was hard to enjoy the good flavors. Worse off is you didn't have much to wash it down with since there are no refills on drinks, but thank heavens for the HOT chai table at least.  To top it off I think the prices are wayyy to high as you have to order everything, rice and naan are not included wih the meals!! Every other indian spot I've been to that is standard. Overall the ambience was quaint but I'm sad to say I've had better and didn't have to spend over $60 for tandoori chicken, spinach paneer, samosas, and pesto naan!!!",

And we didn't go just because we had a Groupon. My husband and I are very familiar with Indian food but our dining companion had never experienced this cuisine. Thanks to our congenial server, Bobby, this dinner left a good impression ... Tandoori-pesto naan, veg appetizer platter, vegetable biryani, lamb tikka masala, saag paneer, roti, raita,  The food was top notch, as was the service.  I must admit, however, that we do not go on weekends when the belly dancer is performing - too noisy and distracting. !",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I go here occasionally when we're too tired to drive to Tempe for better Indian food. The food is mostly decent, which makes it better than the other Indian restaurants in Scottsdale that we've tried. The bengun bhartha (eggplant curry) is good, and chicken tikka masala is generally passable enough to not irritate my Indian boyfriend. One of the other reviews complained that the food is too spicy - I'm not sure this person has been going to the same restaurant as us. My boyfriend orders all of his food at the hot level of spice and it's never been particularly spicy, even for my non-Indian tastes. However, I will say that the quality of the food varies from visit to visit, and the quality of the service is consistently bad. The service is extra bad if you sit on the patio. Despite this, I would recommend sitting on the patio is you're going later in the evening and wish to hold a conversation with your dining partners and not leave with a headache, because they might start blasting music for the belly dancer part way through your visit.",

Been to India several times for business and never seen belly dancing in India. I asked several client friends that are Indian if belly dancing is a tradition. Not one said yes. The belly dancing was a bit annoying and felt slightly uncomfortable with my guests. The dancer was annoyed that no one at my table appreciated it and did not tip.

I honestly think there was something wrong with our waiter, he was extremely slow in more than one way and that's putting it nicely. First we were seated in a booth that was so small I felt claustrophobic, we asked to be seated at a table and that was fine. A few minutes later another couple were seated at that booth, she could barely fit, like her chest was actually resting on the table top and not by choice. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Rogan Josh, we asked for both of them to be mild, they were both so spicy my husband couldn't eat it. Lastly, I was pleasantly surprised to hear they served Pellegrino, I was brought back down to earth when they brought it out warm and served it with ice. I never understand why restaurants do this. IT'S SPARKLING WATER, when warm and mixed with ice it turns flat almost immediately. All in all we had a horrible experience, unfortunately the owners have no idea how to run a business. I wanted to give them feedback about the Pellegrino as that's an easy fix, but by the time the meal was done we figured it would be pointless and we we're probably right.",

    "text": "I'm going to start this review by saying my wife and I were very hungry and had been eating at home more often for health and budget reasons so perhaps we were overly \"aware\" of our feelings and expectations.   We don't typically complain in person or pen.  We arrived and walked past a solemn looking women who was selling traditional garb and jewelry just inside the restaurant near the hostess area.  A little awkward.   The young woman who sat us and served us said she couldn't seat us in a booth which we preferred because \"we might get a larger group of 6.\"    The restaurant was about 50 to 60% full.   About 5 minutes later, one of the other servers sat a couple with an infant in a stroller in the very booth we were eyeing.     Things went downhill from there.   We ordered some Naan, which is listed as an appetizer, along with our entrees.  About 45 minutes later, all of our order arrived, which was about 5 minutes after the booth couples' food arrived.  Our Naan came with no sauces for dipping.  Our server checked on us about 5 to 10 minutes later and we requested the sauces.  She came back to say we're \"out of the chutneys, but I have some 'to go' portions.\"   Ughhh!    A few more thoughts . . .  The food was pretty good.  This may have been an aberrant, young, inexperienced, novice server.  The restaurant was cold.  There were about two or three screaming kids.  The Indian wares saleswomen uncomfortably asked us to take a look on the way out.    We could not see ourselves returning, but I could not, in good conscience, say stay away.",

They made it right, by bringing the garlic, but it took a while.  I ordered the *House Salad* and it wasn't as fresh as it typically is.  I also ordered the *Vegetable Biryani* rice with no peas, when it came, there were peas. I told the waiter and he apologized, and said we should keep that one and they would make another one. Then he came back a few seconds later and said, actually I need to take that one. I was obviously very concerned at this point that they were going to pick out the peas from my dish. The dish came back a few minutes later, luke warm, with a rogue pea or two.   This was very uncharacteristic of our times at Tandoori Times, and I'm hoping it was just an off night. We will be back again, and I have my fingers crossed that it will be a better experience.",

We know what restaurant owner expectations are for servers,cooks ,bartenders, food runners,etc...and this one we thought the owner should know... A pleasant american girl was our server, but where it went unpleasant was her descriptions of the food...  We usually get a veggie dish and a chicken dish, we never heard of what these particular dishes were on this lunch special day, so we asked her to described it.. 1st thing she said is, the veggie dish was just peas,carrots,and looked like vomit, she claim to only like all the chicken dishes they  are all good... My mom and I couldn't believe she was calling the chefs food vomit, that's actually all we could think of, we got our dishes,(1 chicken,1 veggie ) and although it didn't taste bad, our hunger was turned off, and we no longer could eat, so my mom and I basically paid $25 for our chai . We needed the check ,couldnt  find her so i come to find her texting on her phone...what a pet peeve to have that kind of employee, phone usage shouldn't be in the public's eye...but maybe its a more laid back environment, but we weren't getting proper service. So needless to say, we did not enjoy that time at all and felt like we wasted our money that day.",

The service was friendly and the food very good. I think it would be a bit pricey at normal rates. Our only complaints were that when we ordered rice they did not bring us enough to accompany the dishes we had ordered. Also, I have a problem with being charged extra for bread at any restaurant. They charge a hefty price here for every single piece of naan. You don't even get any included with your entree. Rice is something I would generally expect to be included too.-maybe not both but a choice of one or the other. I highly recommend the coconut chicken. Very tasty.",

Cons: Difficult To Locate Slow Kitchen Pricey Ungodly uncomfortable booths  Dishes Worth The Calories: Garlic/Onion Naan Saag Paneer Chicken Tikka Masala  Full Review:  Well all the Indian reviews from the buffay crew finally got to me and I had to have it for a cheat meal :)  Was like Mr Toads wild ride in my truck getting here. A quick U-Turn, brake check, sharp right, up a ramp and into a parking place. That complex is like a maze and I feel lucky that I located my destination.  Walked in the yelp stickered door and was hit with that delicious Indian restaurant smell. What was lacking was the scent of mesquite which you can usually pick up at most places from the tandoor. This was an upclass place so I figured it was just vented well. The place was really cool on the inside having this upscale lounge type feel. Nice and dim and easy on the eyes.  The guy who was double duty as host/waiter seemed a bit annoyed that I was walking in the door at 8:45 when they were open until 10. A tad on the snooty side asked if I was picking up or eating in with a heavy insinuation that I better be picking up. Luckily I was saved by my phone going off as my friend couldn't find the place. I got to bark two for dinner and walked out the door to find my friend.  Was happy when our waitress came to the table since I didn't want much to do with the host. She took our drink order and asked if we needed a few more minutes to which I made the mistake of replying yes. Normally I have these meals pre planned and know exactly what I want but this was a last minute change of destination. I regretted not ordering right then because we didn't see her again for a long while.  My friends have learned that I usually know what's good and just let me order for the table. One of them was an appetizer and as usual I was asked if I wanted that first or with the meal. I try and condense the time that I'm eating bad food to limit the sugar spikes it might create. I'm not even sure why they ask because 9 out of 10 times they bring it first anyway :( this was one of those 9 times.   We waited for what seemed like an eternity for this one dish to show up. At that point I just started eating because I was super hungry. The rest took another 15 minutes to get there. Kitchen here is REALLLLY slow and we were one of only 3 tables.  One more note.. do yourself a favor and get a table. The booths here are horrible. They press you forward into the table and are very uncomfortable on the back after a while.. and you will be there a while :P  Food Details:  Onion Bhaji: I ordered these thinking they were something different. They were basically battered onion strings with what I would guess was a plum based sauce. I was expecting the Indian fritters that I couldn't remember the name of at the time. It was still tasty.  Bread Basket: Sampler of 5 different types of Naan. The only ones I would recommend are the onion and garlic. In the rest the texture was a little different but no flavor profile change and rather dull.  Chicken Tikka Masala: Mmmm I love this dish and it was pretty darn good here. I have had better but it wasn't in the valley. I haven't chowed on much Indian since returning here many years ago.  Saag Paneer: Texturally this was way off from what I'm used to. It was almost like a ground spinach. The spice profile of the dish was excellent but I was a little disappointed in the Paneer. This isn't a strong cheese anyway but this really had no flavor to it. I'm used to it adding at least a creamy/richness to the dish. This one had the taste/texture of firm tofu.  Tandoori Chicken: I was REALLY craving some tandoori chicken and I was disappointed. It wasn't bad but it lacked the bold flavor depth this dish usually has. I also totally missed any mesquite/wood/smoke flavor that should have been there. Between the lack of wood taste and smell I think this place may use a gas driven Tandoori verses a real mesquite charcoal version.  Kheer: Rice pudding is great stuff and adding almonds and raisins to it... yum. This is where someone played a cruel joke on us. The dessert glass was an odd shape and the spoon didn't fit all the way! If you wanted to retain your manners there was 1/4 of the dessert you were unable to reach. Manners were tossed out the window :)  I agree fully with the 3 stars this place has averaged for itself. I made the mistake of trusting some friends over trusting yelp. I could have done much better that night but this was A-OK and tamed the craving. We felt very rushed towards the end of the dinner to pay and get a move on. We were there in plenty of time to eat and leave before closing had this place operated at a normal pace.  Just remember.. if your friends had good taste.. they would be yelpers :)",

I came here expecting for at least my sinuses to be cleared by the \"very spicy\" Chicken Vindaloo w/  the add-on sauces on top to add an additional level of spice.   Unfortunately, I walked away with delicious food nonetheless, but with the spice level of a vinegar-soaked jalapeno.   I was surprised by the mild belly-dancer show; it was my first experience with one and to be honest I did not walk away impressed. I glanced through other reviews and they seemed to have a better experience so maybe the dancers are on rotation, because the ones I saw today left me a bit off-put to the idea of dining here during one of the shows in the future. However, I now personally want to find the best place to get a consistently good belly-dance performance during a meal.   Overall, I had a wonderful meal and a couple laughs with the other diners. Would definitely recommend the place to friends.",

    "text": "\"When they drink dey rum, dey only want roti, aloo with channa, mix up with some curry\" wish they would play more chutney on the radio. Anyway, back to the review....  This is the closest thing Arizona has to a good Guyanese (or Trini) curry. Since there isn't Guyanese roti shop (that I'm aware of) in AZ I make do with Tandoori.  The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. The staff always friendly and accommodating. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the belly dancing when I'm eating. Makes me feel like i'm in a strip club when they're people sticking money in the dancer's sari. I love the fact that there are always Indians eating here, that's a good sign.  You wait a little longer for your food but that means it's fresh. It's not fast food so if you can't handle the wait, go to mc donalds. This is not a food factory. I always get the tikki masala with the Aloo naan. It's good and it faintly satisfies my cravings for curry with roti or dahl pouri. Tandoori's version of Roti is some chip thing not a west indian roti, so if you're looking for that get the Naan. The only thing missing was some rum haha.  The portions are very generous so if you're on a diet.... be prepared to slip up.  Prices are great, I believe a dinner for 2 with no alcohol, is around $35, very affordable for fresh cooked food.",

We had requested outdoor seating, and they put a table together really quick for us, however, no one came to give us menus until we had to run back inside to remind them we were here. The waitress was very nice and helpful, she asked how we liked our food prepared and suggested appropriate spice levels, however, getting our wine, appetizers, food and even the check was a very long process.   I don't know if it has to do with kitchen organization or just a lack of needed staff. But do not come here if you are on a schedule.   The food is great - no complaints there! It wasn't the best Indian food I've ever had, but it really got the job done. We asked for Chef Hot and it actually came out spicy! We did enjoy it. I recommend the Tandoori Chicken,  Lamb TIkka Masala, Lamb Biryani and Naan!  In sum, good food, slow service, a good place to go if you're NOT in a rush to get anywhere after. Also, do not come here when you're on the brink of starvation, because by the time you get your food you might be on the floor.",

Waiter response to my original review - - - \"Hi, i waited to respond so i could look at your check for this day. First i apologize for your experience Lamb Seekh Kabob is served without skewers because they are metal ones and 5' long. We have daily lunch specials which run from $8.95 to $11.95 , its complete lunch and comes with everything. Lunch specials combo of two dishes is only $2.95 additional.  We cannot compare Indian restaurant with Chinese restaurant. Tips were voluntary. We will surely look into our prices compared to other Indian restaurants. Thanks\"  My response to this is...  I followed your lead when ordering our meal from beginning to end... I trusted you... if you had options that could have SIGNIFICANTLY reduced our bill, why was there absolutely no mention of this during my 90 minute lunch?!  I originally thought the service and food was good, but meal was overpriced compared to what we received. Instead, apparently the service was not good. You seem to have let me pay $13+ for each meal plus an additional $3 for rice and $3 for nan when we could have gotten much more for a lesser price (and likely left very satisfied). We trusted you to guide us to good food, not just good food that would pad the bill at a la carte prices. In the future, you may want to guide your customers to your specials.",

I was a newbie to Indian food when I first came here (years and years ago) and now I feel super confident in my ability to order it. You can request what level of spiciness you'd like (scale of 1 to 5) which is nice if you're a wuss like I am! They have bellydancers on the weekends (don't make eyecontact or they will ask you to dance with them lol). The servers are usually very attentive (fill up soda's quickly, can answer questions, you know, the usual).   Cons- I guess my biggest gripe would be that they are forever offering a Groupon. The worst part? When I came here last I was with my aunt and she used a Groupon. NOOOOO!!!! I HATE HATE HATE Groupon and Groupon users (sorry Aunt Kris, you are of course exempt because you at least tip on the full amount). I say this with love Tandoori Times as I have been loyal to you since high school, no more Groupon!

So my husband called to get us a reservation because for some absurd reason you need a reservation to use their groupon.   They didn't answer so he thought they were busy and called back. Eventually someone picked up and made him a reservation.  We showed up on time and the first thing out of the waitstaff's mouth was \"So are you the guy who called 17 times?\" Um I don't think it was 17 times but yeah sure, guilty. The thing was that the asshole was relentless. Embarrassing us in front of the other customers. We tried to explain that the website AND the voice mail gave us incorrect information but the guy Paolo still ended up blaming us by saying \"you should have left a voice mail\" and \"Everyone was sleeping and finally someone woke up to answer roe you.\" He didn't even apologize and definitely made us feel like we were at fault. If he would have taken ownership of the issue it would have been a lot different. I could take the first snide comment and let it roll, but he wouldn't come off it nor apologize. Then we thought hey if they are mad that we woke the cooks up then maybe they'll mess with our food or something.  We felt so embarrassed and ridiculed and everyone was staring at us so we just left. I work hard for my money. I'm not going to spend it on assholes when there are so many other delicious restaurants to choose from.",

Please note that there are three of these Restaurants in AZ: the original, #2 and #3, so the reviews could be misplaced. We dined at the location listed--8140 N Hayden Rd.  I did read other reviews before dinning here. One  review warned: \"We ordered 2 orders of garlic naan and it was burnt. Not just a little over cooked, the whole bottom of each piece was black charred burnt.\"   I \"was going to\" state: DON\"T BURN THE NAAN when we ordered-but I didn't. The result was BURNT NAAN BREAD!  We ordered the Tandoori Shrimp for an appetizer @ $5.95 and it was very good. My wife ordered the Mumbai Curry Prawns @ $13.95 while I had the Chicken Tikki Marsala @ $12.95--kind of Americanized with little taste. My chicken was prepared unlike any other Indian Restaurant we've visited. It was ok but not real Chicken Tikki Marsala--very different! Additionally we ordered: Seasoned rice @ $2.75, Garlic Naan @ $2.75-BURNT! + Mango Chutney @ $1.95, Diet Coke @ $1.95 & one 22 ounce Kingfisher beer served with a WARM glass @ $7 happy hour price--FROZEN GLASS PLEASE!. Cost for above was $49.25 + tax & tip. Reasonable cost for this meal. Our friends ordered something different but the end cost was similar.   Opinion on the meal: We like our meals to be HOT-temperature wise. When you place hot food on a cold serving plate, the heat is transferred to that plate. Other Indian Restaurants we've dined in use preheated  copper kettles or cast iron skillets to serve the food which remains hot. I ordered the food at a spice level of 6. Each restaurant has a different meaning for the level of spice. I would recommend a higher level of spice here. DO NOT ORDER the Naan Bread unless you like it burnt/black on the bottom. Service was very good and the restrooms were clean.  Very strange as Tandoori Times has a Belly Dancer. Maybe this restaurant reflects a different region of India? We feel that they serve an Americanized style of Indian dishes. For my wife & I, Tandoori Times 2 appears to be \"different\" from other CLEAN Indian Restaurants we have dined in AZ--within 77 miles (as per Parani G.yelp review of 1/18/2012) + UT,  NC and NYC. My rating reflects the burnt/black naan bread, low spice level and the meal that cooled off rather fast.  Read a SIGN in the Men's Restroom---Free Wi-Fi--ask your server for the password.  Interesting sign placement! Don't know if the Ladies restroom had THAT sign.",

    "text": "Lunch !!! now that is a different experience. (No belly dancer)  They have a short lunch menu of or either a wrap, or one of three dishes. (Not a fan of mushrooms, but on the day I was the Veggie special was a veggie Korma. I had the Veggie Wrap and my wife had the Veggie lovers special. Both meals were very good. Service was fast, Perfect Indian Lunch.  Will go again, and will consider taking my business contacts over too. (Only for Lunch, way too traumatized by the belly dancer for trying dinner again)  Still the best Tandoori Chicken.",
