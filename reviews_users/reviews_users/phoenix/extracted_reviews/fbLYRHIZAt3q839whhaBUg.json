They give gigantic portions so splitting, especially the ENORMOUS salads, is always a good idea...  except for the chicken lasagna which is out of this world and I was able to eat the whole thing! They have the most phenomenal garlic cheese bread that is just off the charts!  Last night I tried the rigatoni pasta that comes with an incredible creamy spicy marinara and I ordered it with a side of sausage which is the best sausage I've ever had at any Italian restaurant!  That dish is my new favorite!!! I've included a photo!   The desserts are also unbelievable but I never have room for them and have to come for dessert randomly during the day without a meal!  The gigantic chocolate chip cookie comes warm in the pan it was cooked in with a gigantic scoop of ice cream! Absolutely decadent!  The service is always fantastic and even if there's a wait, it goes quickly and you are served almost immediately.  You really cannot go wrong ever at oregano's if you're craving some delicious Italian food!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that the service and food was on point. We went for an early dinner on July 7th, and asked the hostess if we could dine on the patio. She needed to check because it was 100 plus degrees and they would need to get s server , which they did. There was another small group outside too and we shared a fan with them.  Also, there were misters but the wind was blowing them outside the patio. Again, with just a few delays in getting our drinks and food, everything was fine. THEN, since my back was to the entrance, my daughter watched as a family walked straight to the patio, began rearranging tables and sat themselves. Oreganos is not a seat yourself restaurant, and unfortunately I'm guessing they are not to question or relocate customers who choose to think they own the restaurant. Once seated, they asked for the fan to be blown directly on their table. At that point, Oreganos should have provided proper customer service by saying that there is another group of people on the patio and the fan is for all. Nope, the fan went straight to that group. Thankfully, we were almost done. However, my daughter who worked for a very well know Cheesecake establishment said that that is not surprising. Customers come in and think they can and demand to sit wherever they want, and the restaurant pretty much becomes a doormat.   Disappointing. There is a way to approach people and word things to make them realize they are in the wrong. But the hostess and others were young and probably easily intimated. AND, if you want to take care of the customer, you need to take care of all of them and not the entitled few.",

This American inspired italian local chain really has a yummy menu & a hip positive vibe through all locations from Tempe, old town, Bell Rd, or Tucson.  At this stop we sat at the bar with no wait and opted for a margarita and dos Equis for my hubby.  We ordered the simple salad & carne asada pizza.  The salad was large (even the half was a lot for 2 people) with just basic greens and like 2 croutons but maybe only $5 or something reasonable.  The pizza was I believe a puerto penasco named menu item.  After our long and sunny ride we were ready for something substantial and this did the trick.  Grilled carne asada thin crust with a yummy cilantro pesto to bring it together.    Our service was friendly & professional even if the thin crust pizza took 40 minutes to come out.",

    "text": "I have been to Oregano's on several occasions when my son was a bit younger. He loved making his own pizza, but I never really found anything all that spectacular about the food. However, tonight we decided to give it a try because Dave wanted a deep dish. We arrive a little after 9 and by the time we were seated and had a chance to look at the menu, it was 9:30.  We ordered a deep dish and a salad. The server promptly told us that they took over an hour to make(They closed at 10) . You would think that might be listed on the menu, but it wasn't. He was nice about it and we decided to see if there was something else we wanted; however, I knew Dave really wanted the deep dish so I told him to get it, they said it was fine. (We like to respect the closing times of businesses, if you close at 10, then you want your customers gone and to move on with your day, you don't want to be hanging around). We decided it would be ok and we ordered the deep dish,. This time the server informed us it was 80% cheese, and if we wanted more meat than cheese to go with the Pan Style over the Deep Dish, and by the way, the Pan style also takes an hour to make. We decided we did want the pan and we ordered. I also got the House Special salad.  The salad was good, the pizza was really good and while it might not come through in the text here, the service was really good. We really like it when the servers tell us what is good and what is just ok, that is part of our dining experience.  We could tell this guy was being honest and really wanted us to enjoy our experience here. This alone moved this review to 4 stars.   Now here is the bad: Almost every location is on a wait during dinner, almost every day of the week; if a pizza takes an hour to make...don't you think you should list that on the menu? These guys have always impressed me with their witty marketing, so I was really mad I had to wait an hour for my pie! Secondly, the waiter also told me people will typically call ahead and place their Pan or Deep Dish order and then come in about 30 minutes later and tell the hostess they placed their order and decided to eat it there, skipping the wait and the line. Now your promoting Bad Consumer behavior and these same people get to cut in line because they called in? How is that fair to the people that are sitting there for an hour or so waiting for a table?   I would only give these guys 2 stars for all the dishes I have had and didn't care for, I never found them all that flavorful or original; however, the Pan pizza was good and the service excellent for customers that closed the restaurant, so they get bumped this time around. Unfortunately, I doubt we will go back anytime soon because it will take an hour for our pizza and we won't be one of those BAD customers that decides to call ahead and skip the wait.",

I asked to see the manager she'll be right here the server said. I didn't get my Ziti  until 745 it came in a bread bowl that was completely burned and hard. Again I ask for the manager and was told she'd be right there about two minutes later she came and I said well we asked for your 20 minutes ago and she got very nasty said I was just told 10 seconds ago was very patronizing and condescending she apologize for the late dinner and then she said she would pay for the dinner   She kept telling me that the bread bowl with just the garnish it wasn't really saying my question to her was why would you even serve something it looks like this is just a  garnish very very upset we won't be back",

Was told that I would have no wait. Walk up to the door and was told that it would be 30-45 minutes. I was super annoyed but we waited anyway. Sat for 15 minutes before our waiter came to take our orders. Luckily he was very nice. Waited 45 minutes before our APPETIZERS came out. Ran out of drinks and could not find our waiter. Finally a manager came over and apologized for us waiting so long for an appetizer. Said she would give us free desert. By the time we finally got our food, we were ready to go home and get to bed.. We had originally planned on running errands after. Food was awful. Decided  to opt out of our free desert because we were afraid to wait another hour. This location was awful. I would never recommend it to my worst enemy.",

The sausage and peperoni were really good and so were the veggies and more importantly it was the correct amount of topping.  We also had a cesar salad, it was huge!  The server warned us that a junior salad was more than enough to split and she was right.  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Definitely will go back.",

While I don't expect everything to be made from scratch I was so disappointed that neither my dinner or my friend's dinner had anything that was actually made at Oregano's.  My friend was upset that her salad had bruised and wilted lettuce.  When she mentioned this to the server the manager came over and offered to open another bag of salad for her.  She had the zitti  and it was clear that the bread bowl, the pasta, and the sauce were just packaged items that were combined at the restaurant.  I had the Italian sausage with waffle fries and again, can we say not from scratch.",

When inquiring about the wait for our pizza the female bartender barked at us and said that sausage takes 30 minutes.  She continueed to be rude and argumentive to us and after requesting the manager (young lady) the bartender continued her rudeness.  The manager went to check on our pizza and said \"it's only been 26 minutes\".  Well young lady, is that 26 minutes after the inept bartender put our order in the POS or was it 26 minutes after we ordered it.  Ever think about that?  Then the bartender's regulars had to pipe up and defend her rudeness.  My money will spend the same at any of the numerous choices aroung PV Mall, but won't be doled out at this place anymore.  For a place that wants to be \"your neighborhood joint\", their hospitality is lacking.",

There were other goodlooking servers too so that's always a plus, right?The food was pretty good, and the prices for pastas were surprisingly cheap.

They suggested it, and said they had taken several family members there when they also had come to visit. Parking is crowded, but upon arriving, I found the fun red, white, and green color bright and festive and espcially liked the patio. Even though it was 100+degrees, dining on the patio is comfortable because of the powerful fans and misters they have surrounding it.  Oreganos seems to draw a younger crowd, at least at this location. The menu is big, and the portions are huge, as other Yelpers have noted. My husband and I ordered a thin crust Combination pizza, a medium. My cousin ordered a salad, her boyfriend ordered a pasta dish with cream sauce. As an appetizer we had cheesy garlic bread which was good. Our pizza was way too much food for just the two of us, and had an abundance of toppings. The crust was light and flaky, not soggy. We were pleased with it and gave it to my cousin to finish for lunch the following day. Not my favorite pizza, but a good one. I still love Round Table back home in Cali. I don't know if they have this chain in Phoenix??",

We love Oregano's and have been going to the old town and Scottsdale and Shea location for years.  Always great service and food.  But this location broke the mold in the worse way!  Our last visit we were told 35 minute wait, which is fine, so we had drinks at the bar.  40 minutes later the hostess told us our table was being cleared and she actually pointed to it.  5 minutes later another party is there, so we wait for another 20 minutes.  Finally get sat outside when we asked to be inside.  No one comes by for at least 10 minutes.  When they do we ask for the wobbly table to be fixed and our waitress tells us \"it's frowned upon\".  And it just got worse from there, wings, salad, pizza, pasta all came out in 10 minute intervals, no utensils, drop a beer off and run off with out getting another order...  Everyone in our party of 7 talking about how poor the service was. It was a birthday so I choose to bite my tongue and call a manager later.  When I do he is very understanding and apologizes.  He says he is going to mail me a gift card and a week later, no gift card so I call back to check the address only to get another manager that takes my address again and promises to get back to or mail the gift card.  A week later, no gift card.",

Let's start with probably the worst hostess I've ever dealt with at any restaurant. Went at almost 9pm still a little busy. She told us the wait was 15 mins but I saw at least 3 tables that just haven't been cleaned so I say we will wait. Then she points to 2 open bar stools and says you can sit there if ya want. No thanks. We wait 15 for the tables to get cleaned, and we go to the little middle section with probably 4 out of 6 booths open and she sits us at the tiny table with 2 little chairs? Um no we'll take a booth. She rolls her eyes throws the menus on the booth table and walks away. Just rude in my opinion. Your job is customer service. Wash dishes if you hate dealing with people. Been in the restaurant business for 20 years and would never hire someone like this. Service was good. Pizza had a giant burnt bubble but it wasn't bad. Meatballs were also good. Shrimp scampi had no taste though. Pizooki was good but that's hard to mess up. Take the 15 min drive to the better location on Shea.",

    "text": "Wow, didn't think I'd really have to be writing a poor review for Oreganos. Been here probably 50 times over the past few months and today was the last straw. Came in for lunch at 1 o'clock. There was no hostess at the stand so we stood there for about 15 minutes until somebody finally came up and asked us how many. We then waiting for another 15 minutes until we finally gave in and accepted a table outside in the sun. Sat down, ordered our food, and waited. And waited. And waited. We watched about 8 or 9 other groups come sit down outside with the same waitress, order, EAT THEIR FOOD, pay, and leave. We didn't receive our ordered food until 2:45. We arrived at the restaurant at 1pm. Ordered at 1:45. It took us an hour to get 1 pizza, a salad, and a chicken parm pasta!!!! To top it all off, the waitress looked like she literally would rather be doing anything else than have to talk to our table. The food comes out & we can all tell it's been sitting around for a least 20 minutes. The noodles in the chicken parm were hard, literally uncooked. The salad was soggy (and had two ingredients we requested off), and the pizza looked like it was a left over pizza! Actually looked like they might've pulled it out of the fridge and microwaved it. This experience truly baffled me and I almost couldn't believe I was sitting in an Oreganos. Truly tragic to watch this unfold in my own eyes. Couldn't pay me any amount of money to come back to this location. Bonus part; She brought us the check, and I put my card in it and waited for her to come grab it. The funny thing is, is that she never came back. That card and check sat at the end of the table for 30 minutes while she seemed to disappear and left us sitting outside on the patio alone. I had to go inside the restaurant to go find her and give her the check. They're extremely lucky we didn't just walk out, place is an absolute joke. Quit hiring people who are incapable of performing simple tasks especially when it's not even close to busy on a Weekday Afternoon.",

Came back in to tell the host (make) that we would take any available table like we were asked to do after we checked out the patio.  Not only did we have over 8 families be seated of which came in well after we were waiting, the hostess (female) then proceeded to argue with me about what I wanted when we asked why we hadn't been seated.  We were still listed as 2nd in line. As we left and no one was left to seat?!?!  Obviously the team working today is not organized and using their seating system as it was designed.  Food is great but this locations customer service has a lot to be desired.  As a reminder to this establishment - you live and die by referrals and return customers.  Be organized and make it right when a customer is upset.",

Sausage sandwich had just the right amount of fennel, although if it were about 2 bucks cheaper they'd have gained the extra star. For a 10 buck sandwich I often have something to take home, but I didn't here. Fast and courteous service and Nina answered all my questions which is always helpful when it's the first time visiting a restaurant.  Since this is nearby one of my favorite places to see a play  Theatre Artists Studio | 12406 N.

They even have overhead heaters to keep you warm as it cools down in the evening.  I was not very hungry so I just ordered the Italian wedding soup for my dinner. The bowl is quite large and is very filling. They serve it in a pizza crust bowl which looks cooler than it tastes. I found that the bowl tasted either dry and flour-y or almost sour. The soup more than made up for it though. It has lots of little meatballs and one large one in a chicken broth. I would order it again.",

(we had 3 different dressings) pieces of broccoli and kale etc were in the dressing cups. Makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is. All 5 of us had terrible stomach aches that evening, not sure if it was because we ate so much salad or what. Makes me nervous to return.   Pros: Comfortable seating at a table VERY nice and helpful waiters and staff - they nicely turned down the pumping music so we   could hear each other Food was very quick coming out of the kitchen",

I went here mostly because I wanted what I think of as Chicago style pizza, which is what they call \"stuffed\" here. It was tasty, what I expected, and our waitress was accommodating and outgoing.  Not really sure why anyone would get the normal Chicago-style (thin crust) they have there; as my wife commented: \"The shredded parmesan they spread over the pizza is thicker than the crust!\" but hey, isn't my problem if someone wants to pay $18 for a 3 oz. piece of dough stretched to oblivion.  I DIGRESS. In any case, an okayish place. Just don't come here if you're looking to get seated fast, as it's always packed, or if you want some kind of authentic Italian pizza or small business experience.",

If you go in expecting it, it's really not a problem. Our server let us know at the beginning that the pizza would take about 45min to come out because it was being made from scratch--sounds fine to me!   I came here with my two sister-in-laws. We had a round of Drunken Monkeys, which were VERY strong and tasty. We started with a regular-sized dinner salad ($5.99) which was just the right size for the three of us. Then an appetizer of garlic bread came out. It didn't seem much longer until our Grandma G's pizza came out. The pizza was HUGE, fresh and delicious! The three of us ate until we were stuffed, and then two of us brought home separate boxes with the leftovers, which were enough for a lunch for the both of us!   At the beginning of the dinner, I had ordered a Hawaiian (canadian bacon and pineapple) Chicago-style deep-dish pizza to-go for my husband. He LOVED it. It lasted him 3 meals--the pizza was so heavy! You could do your weight reps for the day with that pizza...  I am definitely a fan of Oreganos and will definitely be back! Word of advice though, GO EARLY!! We went at 5:15pm, and were seated promptly and the food came out in a reasonable time. The place was very full, and I'm sure the later you go, the longer the wait is.",

If you're a drinker try the BELLINI! Its an amazing frozen cocktail made with red wine, rum, champagne and schnapps! It will knock your socks off in a good way!     I'm disappointed in the change of recipe for the toasted raviolis! PLEASE change it back to the original recipe it was soooooooo much better. I'm still a sucker for cheese so I will order them as an appetizer anyway but I still prefer the old recipe.  Try the Pablo Picasso Mexican Salad it is to die for! SOOOO amazing with the crunchy tortilla strips and the freshly grilled chicken, it a must try!!! But for all the salads I recommend the Jr. size because the normal size is HUGE and the Jr size is still enough for three people to share!  The Alfredo the dark and the deep dish pizzas are also great!!!   **** DON'T FORGET TO SAVE ROOM FOR THE PIZZA COOKIE!!! stick with the traditional chocolate chip version, I love peanut butter and macadamia nuts but both don't even come close to the amazingness of the original! Sure to be the best part of your visit!",

    "text": "Aiyaaah the dreaded 3 star review. I hate writing the 3 star review because you already know exactly what I'm going to say. 3 stars says it all. A-OK. Good, but not great, nothing special. And that basically summarizes my feelings about Oregano's.  So I came here with a friend. He claims it's one of his favorite Italian restaurants and Italian is pretty hard to mess up so why not? Tagging along... We step into the restaurant. Colors green and red everywhere! Digging the atmosphere! Digging the old school vintage vibes! Jukeboxes and checkered floors and walls adorned with paintings and dim lights! It's wonderful! So an A+ for decor! But then again, I am not an interior decorator. So what do I know?  Moving on to the food! I ordered a pasta called Alfredo the Dark. It came with spiral pasta drenched in cream sauce, diced tomatoes and poblano chillies. Underneath the pasta were 4 slices of bread, made infinitely more appetizing by the fact that it was sitting beneath the pasta and soaking up ALL the cream sauce. Divine!  The chicken in the pasta was well seasoned and roasted. The pasta itself, while a solid pasta, wasn't mind-blowing. Delicious and safe. Too safe. The poblano chillies did not have much of an impact on the dish which was very disappointing. In fact, the dish wasn't spicy in the least. But other than that, you know. Chicken pasta with cream sauce. It was good! You can't screw it up. I just wish the poblano chillies had challenged me.  Good thing about this place is that the service was fantastic. Also, the portion sizes are pretty decent too. My ~$12 pasta became 2 whole meals for me so that's always nice!   Will I return here? Yes absolutely. I had a lovely meal with my friend and I'm sure we shall return in due time. And I will come back with absolutely no qualms because this is a good restaurant. It's not a great restaurant and it falls far short of my finest Italian dining experiences but it's a good restaurant and sometimes good is good enough  (and cheap enough).",

Marinara sauce seemed really spicy, no one in my party could eat much of it.  As I picked the restaurant upon my husbands rave reviews, and I was paying for dinner, I was disappointed to see so many half full plates at the end of the meal.   On the positive side-  The appetizers were phenomenal - garlic cheesy bread and pesto bruschetta so no one left hungry.  The gooey cookie and ice cream were a big hit with the kids.  I ordered the tuna sandwich and it was delicious. Walnuts add a nice crunch.  The bellinis were sweet and refreshing.   Wait staff was great - Josh is very competent, efficient, friendly and personable.  Wait times and spiciness brought down my scores, atmosphere and attitude of wait staff and management might bring me back.",

It was nice until he accused me that it was my fault the pizza was soggy and sitting in a puddle of juices and water because I ordered a veggie stuffed pizza. The man acted like he and the restaurant had no fault in it at all. I was just shocked. What horrible customer service! When he realized what he had done there was no apology for his behavior until over 30 minutes had gone by and my soon to be husband had spoken with him several times. By then I was in tears because my night (not to mention my dinner) had been ruined.  I would avoid this location, if you can. I would go to the one off of Shea and Scottsdale Road or on Camelback or any other location. The only thing that gave this place one star was are wonderful and amazing waiter Mike. He was so helpful and so concerned that we had been treated so poorly. I love Oregano's but I will not be returning to this location.",

The service and perkiness almost borders on annoying. Almost. They have just he right amount of friendliness and sincerity to not cross over into the cloying territory. Drinks were never empty, the check cycle was quick. What more can you ask for from your waitstaff?  The Alfredo the Dark pasta (with chicken) never disappoints. It is big enough to take half of it home and have a great meal the next day as well. The salads are huge. Even what they have as a \"side\" salad is meal sized dish of fresh Romaine, Parmesan, and tangy Caesar dressing.",

I wanted to eat it all but I ordered dinner as well and didn't want to fill up on bread. For dinner I had the El Diablo shrimp pasta and my room mate had the chicken parmesan sandwich. The sandwich was to die for, the chicken was flavorful and crispy and the coleslaw and fries were just perfect. I know this because I ate half of his sandwich due to the fact that I could not eat my pasta! It was way too spicy for me. (I love spicy, and we both agreed that it was pretty Damn spicy) I'm only giving four stars because we also ordered wings as an appetizer as well and we received them after we got our dinner. We only ate one because we were full and over it so we packed them togo. We did order alot of food but I'd rather have microwaved pasta than reheated wings. But other than that everything was great.  Oh! And whoever was bartending that night, kudos to ya because those Moscow mules were on point! So delish and refreshing! I'll definitely be back!",

First of all, my husband and I went there the other night and had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table that was empty when we arrived.   Then we ordered pasta. My husband had the Pasta Basta and it was fabulous, exactly as it was described, but I ordered the Alfredo. This was less than desirable, while the noodles were cooked well, they looked and tasted like they were just tossed in olive oil and served. I expected some sauce, but there was nothing!!! It is served with this really dry bread, that I assume you are supposed to dip in the \"sauce\".   To top it off, when we let the waitress know that there was no sauce, she got her manager who came out and insisted that this is the way it is served (it was boxed up but he didn't even look at it) and next time ask for extra sauce. I shouldn't have to pay extra for something that should come with what I order.   I have to say the one nice thing they did was comp our dessert.",

Would think in 25 minutes they could have at least gotten that right. The place wasn't overly busy as when I looked around to see if it was I saw several servers just standing at tables talking to customers for several minutes at a time. This tells me they felt it wasn't too busy so they could spend extra time chatting up customers. Hopefully this was just an off day for everyone working there.",

The wait seemed a bit long for a Thursday night,  but that could have been a sign that the food was going to be amazing... Not the case.  The service was pretty bad; we had our food picked out for about 20-25 minutes before the server came back to us to take our order.  We ordered the Cheesy Bread as an appetizer, Garlic Chicken Lasagna, and Pasta Basta with Meatballs.  We were not given the opportunity to order drinks after looking at the menu.    Our cheesy bread was fine- not great, too much cheese... but out on time.  When our entrees came out, they got it wrong- the Lasagna was the wrong type of lasagna entirely.  My boyfriend was starving so ate it, as the waitress was not going to come back.  Eventually, someone from the kitchen came out with the correct lasagna for my boyfriend.  The waitress apologized and asked if everything was okay and walked away before I could tell her that the Pasta Basta was terrible.  I ate a small amount as changing orders was not going to happen.    Crappy food, crappy service.",

Other than that, there is no reason to give this place any fewer than 5 stars. All of the food is excellent. The wings are among the best I've ever had and each sauce is unique and tasty. No time wasted with tiny winglets...it's all drumettes.   The sausage sandwich is good and spicy, with cornmeal crusted waffle-fries and a side of marinara. The Vino Bambino salad is fresh and different with wine marinated chicken. And I haven't even mentioned the pizza! Thin crust or Chicago-style is available, but the thin crust is so good, we haven't even tried the Chicago. Saved room? The pizookie is sweet and gooey.   The service is always fast and friendly, plus their shirts are funny. A great, casual atmosphere perfect for a delicious meal. Always a must stop when I'm in Phoenix.",

Came in last night with the table of four. Put my name on the waitlist and waited for an hour for a table. It was my brother's birthday and I asked the hostess to tell our server to bring out two pizookies for his birthday. I sit down at the table with an empty cocktail glass and still wait at least 10 minutes to be acknowledged. My server finally stops over and says are you waiting on three more and I said yes and proceeds to not come back for about 15 minutes until the other 2 in my party arrives. We don't get a Hi how are you? we get are you ready to to order?. We had to ask for water and said we needed another minute but he never even offered to refill my cocktail. When we ordered I had to ask for a glass of wine, which he had forgotten about for 20 minutes and I had to remind him. Food came out pretty quick  but he never even asked how it was. My boyfriend joined half way thru the meal and the server didnt come back until we were done with dinner. He had to ask to order a drink from the server, who didn't even offer me another glass of wine. Its about 945 at this time and hes nowhere to be seen- probably doing sidework so he can leave. He finally comes back and asks what kind of pazookies we wanted....which I had already told the hostess....so it could be a surprise, but nope! That was ruined too. He drops the check, and I tipped him a generous 15% considering the service. Comes back immediately to pick it up and takes all of our glassware to the bar to be cleaned but leaves our 3 stacks of dirty plates. I don't want to pull the card but I'm a restaurant manager and if I knew one of my servers gave such atrocious service, I'd fire them.",

I recommend mom's sausage and peppers, if you want pasta, or the big beefstro salad, if that's your thing, but honestly, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   I will agree with another reviewer that there is very little else besides pasta and pizza, but if you don't want a high carb meal, don't go to a restaurant that labels itself a \"pizza bistro\" or just about any Italian restaurant for that matter.",

Haven't tried the pasta dishes, but they are popular and in some cases unlimited.  Pizzas are also very good and come in a large variety, thin crust or deep dish.

Unlike most of the reviews, I had absolutely no wait because I called in the order to go. The lady who answered the phone was very pleasant, but was puzzled as to why I didn't want marinara sauce with my calamari and garlic bread. I'm not a fan of sauces.  I should have trusted my instinct and passed on the food that apparently had a \"sauce requirement\", but I was hungry and wanted calamari. The menu said \"calamari rings\" but it was strips, with way too much breading. I won't grade down on the sogginess, mainly because it was in a plastic container, steaming hot, for 15 minutes before I ate it. Sogginess aside, the calamari was more breading than meat, and just laid there staring at me, wondering why I didn't smother it in the required marinara sauce. The garlic bread was average.   The staff was pleasant, the portion sizes are good for the price, and there was reasonable parking, but since it was almost 8pm that should be a given.  I may try Oregano's again, but not anytime soon.",

I never understood the value of having someone to talk to and just spill one's feelings all over the floor (in my case kinda literally because I'm lactose intolerant and my stomach died a little).

    "text": "We were greeted with a friendly face and accommodating service. We got to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful Phoenix weather. The outdoor seating was spacious, clean, and well-lit during the evening.   We shared the Pesto Penne Bake and a House Salad. All of which were delicious. The Penne Bake came in a large bread bowl. It was filled with pesto covered penne, tomato, basil, and topped with mozzarella cheese and sundried tomatoes. Between the two of us, we were stuffed and nearly finished it! We also asked for a side of marinara for dipping the bread bowl.  The house salad wasn't anything special, but good appetizer before such a carb loaded entree.   Our company had a 16\" thin crust pizza. They ate nearly all of it between the two of them and the next morning, had the leftovers. I'm assuming that they wholeheartedly enjoyed the pizza.  It took me a long time to get to Oregano's since it's a chain, but I'm glad I finally did get to try it! It's definitely a cool place, especially for large groups. The food is very reasonably priced with LARGE portions. It is also very vegetarian (but NOT vegan) friendly which greatly surprises me!  I really want to come back and try their deep dish pizza!",

    "text": "I've never been a fan or Oregano's in the past - only eaten there a couple times in the last 10 years.  However, I was willing to try it again since it opened up near our hood.  They have changed the menu since the last time I was there.  For the better, that is.  We ended up stopping by the first week they were open and wow was it absolutely NUTS!  I ordered a deep dish (being from Chicago and seeing it's a hard time to find good deep dish in Arizona, had to try).  It was undercooked but edible.  Sometimes you can't judge on first impressions, especially since the restaurant just opened, so I went back the next week with a friend.  I order the deep dish again and it was awesome!  The crust was cooked to perfection with the perfect amount of seasoning.    We have been back numerous times since the first week.  The staff is very friendly and most are down-to-earth.  We have met bartenders Robin and Brooke - both incredible bartenders with incredible customer service and a senses of humor.  We have also met a couple servers, Shawn and Jill.  They were attentive, quick, polite, funny and made our experience worth coming back and asking to sit in their section.  We end up sitting at the bar most of the time though since there always seems to be seats there without a wait.  We have ordered takeout quite a bit (slice & salad).  It's a 50/50 chance whether they get the salad right for takeout though.  We've never had any problems with the food when we go in for lunch or dinner - only takeout.    The reason for 4 rather than 5 stars: 1.  The 50/50 chance of food being wrong or not cooked properly. 2.  The staff is GREAT!!  (other than that one time we sat for 17 minutes while the bartender hit on a girl on the other side of the bar.  Brooke came to our rescue) 3.  The front house receptionists don't always seem to work together and there's sometimes confusion about tables, etc and they are obnoxiously friendly, at times. :-)  Overall, they are a great neighborhood pizzeria and worth checking out.  Wish they delivered...",

    "text": "Growing up in Chicago, I think I can safely say I know Chicago style pizza.  It's in my blood.  I've been going to Oregano's for years since living in Phoenix and it never fails to impress me from location to location.  It's Chicago style all the way!    This past weekend we decided to dine at the Paradise Valley location and again we were very well taken care of.  From the greeting you receive when you walk in the door to the service and staff.  It's always pleasant.   What really is something that isn't new to the restaurant business but Oregano's does so well is during the meal, a manager stops by to make sure everything is going well.  A manager, who was actually quite funny, came out and not just to ask \"How is everything\". No she genuinely made sure all was good made us feel like we are being taken care of.  In a busy restaurant like this to have that kind of attention is impressive.  One thing I have to say is a stand out for me and is so incredibly important is consistency. It's the reason I've been going to Oregano's for years and will continue for years to come.   We had the Stuffed Numero One.  What I would normally call \"Deep Dish\" in Chicago.  I still get confused about how to order that, but I digress.  It's a larger pizza and when you order it they always tell you it will take 45 min's.  Our server was great about coming back and checking to make sure we were doing ok, filling drinks and making sure all was good.    The best part of the night?  Leftovers!  If you're looking for great pizza, excellent service and a nice evening out do yourself a favor and go to Oregano's!",

We sent it back and got a thin crust, the manager was very good about taking care of us as customers.  But the kitchen staff must have gotten irritated because I and another two in our party came down ill immediately afterward with indigestion to nausea.   We've all agreed we are too nervous to return to this location, but will go back to the Scottsdale and Shea restaurant which has given us great food and service on every occasion.",

Not awe inspiring pizza like you might find in Italy or great pizza that you might find elsewhere in Europe. Still, it's pretty good pizza.  You have to search hard in Arizona to find better. Please note that you always wait to be seated and after you order, the pizza will take even longer to get your table. Don't worry it will be well worth the wait.",

    "text": "A True italian pregame meal has been a mainstay of mine ever since I enjoyed one at the dirty padre a few years back. We were greeted by a stout young lass offering a selection of pizza, drinks, and hour and a half wait times. We decided to wait and ordered some tasty drinks (belini was fresh!). After being seated, we listened to some crappy stories my friend had to tell while out salad was delivered. This salad was a True blessing to our palates. We were truly living in the second book of Ruth! Once the meal was finished, I took the check and exclaimed, \"Bahama mama!\" What a  great meal for a great price. I loved it so much that I decided to leave them a gift in the form of an incredibly large dump in their men's restroom. I hope they have toilet insurance, because I am pretty sure I saw the toilet start to softly weep after I was done. 10/10 will enjoy again!",

I explained food  cold and with a pleasant attitude the barkeeper took it away.....forever.  At one point he snapped\"we have to re cook the whole order\".  The mgr walked by several times and didn't say a word.  Finally after my companion finished his meal and I went back to the left over salad....I asked for my dinner to go. I was told the manager had taken care of it.  CONCEPT:  two people go out to eat, not good for one to sit while guest eats. kitchen, bartender punish you for not being happy with food.  Complimentary meal...not so much...shitty attitude..no repeat business...not in business plan. Have been to other locations and never an issue. Bad management",

I don't blame Oregano's so i'll still go to Camelback or Scottsdale.....even though they are miles out of the way.

This visit we had eight (two of which were children) and our server Brianna took care of us. Some places don't check on you often when children are in the party but Brianna was great.   Can't say enough good things about the pizza but the thin crust is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you're ever in the Phoenix area you have to visit Oreganos",

    "text": "Thanks to a good friend who brought me here for dinner, I was able to experience this cute little spot!  It was a warm night and we opted to be seated outside so that we could take advantage of the great weather.  I was in a pizza type of mood and decided with the help of our awesome server that I was going to order some thin crust.  But before talking about the pizza, I have to talk about our appetizer first:  BOOM Dip: Named after our infamous Kaboom Room, it's a delicious concoction of spinach, artichokes and cheeses served with our Italian chips for dipping.  If you like Spinach and Artichoke dip, then this is going to be right up your alley.-- It's oozing of melted cheese and artichoke and the chips are large enough to hold globs of dip into your mouth.  I loved this stuff and if you didn't take it away then I probably could have kept on eating it.    Clark Street Meat Pizza: (straight from the menu) It's the spicy meat lover's pizza that keeps on giving. It's loaded with our Chicago sausage, capicolla, salami, garlic, mozzarella, oregano, chili flakes, Parmesan and parmano cheeses, then finished with fresh basil and more parmano. You won't remember your name after a night with this hottie.--I ordered the medium size and it was enough to feed about three people at the least.  The only reason I'm taking off one star is because it was a bit salty for my tastes.  Other than that, they didn't skimp on toppings.  What made this place truly stand out was our server Lily (If I have her name wrong, please forgive me!!).  She was amazing-- took care of us from the moment we sat down and made us all want to come back just so that we could be seated in her section.",

The hostess wasn't there when we arrived and after standing awkwardly at the hostess station for over 5 minutes, the hostess came and asked us if \"we were ready to be seated\"!? No apologies.\"Yes, we're ready.\" Then the bartender couldn't make the drink I wanted because he would have had to go to the kitchen to get jalapenos.  I ordered the stuffed Riga Tony . It came with almost no sauce. I asked the waitress for more sauce  and she came back with it about 10 minutes later. I also requested a Diet Pepsi which never did make it.

For today I ordered the meatball pasta with ice tea and man it couldn't get any better. The meat is well cooked although depending on your preference you can also get it medium done, medium rare, and so on. The noodles are juicy and well marinated, every bite is exceptionally delicious.   Overall, very satisfied with oreganos and their service.",

I had the ginger beer one and it was soooo bomb! You have to get that! Then I had the root beer cocktail thing and it was sooo good! Nice and strong and the flavor was amazing ! Oh the bruschetta is forgettable so don't even order that.

This time it was exceptional because not only was our food awesome but so was our service!  Autumn was so on top of everything from getting drinks, bringing us extra napkins to our food hot!  We had a party of 10 and kids were with us she asked if we wanted their food before ours,  she was just great!  Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants Chicago style food because you'll get it!",

Very, very little chicken (and I really looked for it -- a small piece here or there).  Not even tasting it at all.  It was also a pretty small portion for the price.  The most egregious problem of all was that the pasta was chewy.(!)   I actually had to take a piece out of my mouth and lay it aside, it was so hard to chew.  The whole bottom layer of the lasagna was inedible - could not cut it with my fork even!  That's pretty bad for a pasta place.  On the plus side, the people who work there are great - very friendly and responsive (only reason I didn't rate it a one star).  If I do go back, I will be certain to avoid the lasagna, but I seriously doubt I will go back.  I will go back to Olive Garden - their lasagna isn't 'chewy'.",

Over the past couple years I've been coming here he's been so friendly, remembers my name, what I like to eat and drink, and provides the hospitality that Oregano's is famous for.  He has other regulars who visit him as well. Food's always delicious, too! Hot items always come out hot, cold items nice and fresh. I never sit at a table so I can't comment on that experience but the service I receive at the bar is always spot on.",

Started off as we sat down by ordering the 12\" stuffed pizza with Sausage and Pepperoni as was told it would take 45 to 50 minutes.  Also ordered Pene Pasta which came with a good slice of Italian Bread.  Finally ordered deep fried zucchini.   After reading the Azcentral review that listed as one of the best deep dish or stuffed pizza and oregano was listed, had to try it. Was totally in disagreement to this stuffed pizza being top five. Pizza was very wet and soggy and on top of that did not taste very much if any sausage or pepperoni. The outer crust was not bad but it was just too soggy with alot of tomato sauce and cheese which is not a good combination for my stomach.   The pasta was ordered with butter and that is what we got because my daughter had her 4 wisdom teeth removed 5 days prior. The deep fried zucchini was also not the best I have had and borderlined being frozen not fresh tasting.   Overall was very disappointed and l would not recommended the stuffed pizza as azcentral did",

The bread soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Next we shared the Oregano's Favorite salad. I would come back just to eat this salad, it was HUGE. The tomato and olives brought out a refreshing flavor to the salad and complimented the light dressing. And last we shared the Clark Street pizza. Just enough kick to it with the spicy meat and pepper flakes. EVERYTHING we ordered was amazing. Will definitely return to try other items on their menu.",

And let me help out here, Join The Waitlist it is NOT a reservation. It simply puts you \"at the top of the list\" (whatever that means). Long story short, we had a party of 8 and the live wait time was 15-30 minutes so we checked in thinking that by the time we got there, we wouldnt have to wait too long seeing that we gave Oreganos a head up - figuring this was the whole point of the waitlist. Why did we wait an hour and a half after getting there?! There were ZERO people waiting when we got there so I'm not sure why it essentially took 1 hour 45 minutes to seat us (from when we checked in through Yelp to when we were actually seated). I suggest you call before going to find out the actual wait time and completely ignore the Live Wait Time feature on Yelp.",

Ordered the Oregano's Classic salad w chicken, an order of golden wings extra crispy, and Brussels sprouts.  Let me just say, the Brussels sprouts are the only redeeming part of this meal...the wings are not only not extra crispy, they are literally cold and soggy.  Blech.  The salad is also not good, the lettuce is wilted and black on the edges...it's basically inedible.  The Brussels are great, however!  I think the issue w the wings is that, when we arrived to pick it up, they were already done but were \"waiting on the salad\"...which took 20 more minutes!  Not sure why the salad was prepared after the wings, but having them sit in a plastic takeout container while a salad was prepared, didn't probably do them any justice.  I hate giving bad reviews, I really do...especially to places I normally love...but this was disappointing tonight...so much so that I've ordered a salad and wings from another restaurant.  Eek!",

We went for my dad's birthday tonight and it was a bit of a disaster. We had a party of 7 with 4 people over the age of 60. We waited an hour and were seated in the back of the patio. It was 99 degrees at that hour and we were seated where there were no misters. We asked if we could be reseated inside or in the main part of the patio. The woman who was the manager told us we'd have to wait for 90 mins for either. She claimed there was a party of 15 that was waiting ahead of us. As it turns out, that was a party of 10 and they showed up an hour after we did. After unnecessary back and forth, they moved the not so powerful portable AC in our direction so we stayed.  The food, as usual, was solid but the service was bad. Our waitress dropped multiple comments throughout our dinner about how other guests under the covered patio with misters were annoyed that the direction of the portable AC changed. She didn't come check on us very much so we had empty water glasses for a lot of the night.   Overall, the way they dealt with the seating was unprofessional and difficult. This could have been avoided if they had asked us if we were ok with being seated in that part of the patio prior to placing us there. I don't think I'll be back here any time soon.",

I visited many restaurants in that time (from quick places like in & out to big fancy steakhouses to trendy hot spots downtown).  And nobody impressed me more than Oregano's.  Service was friendly and on point both times I came.  The food was remarkably delicious and prices were very reasonable.   I'm a bartender in D.C. and to this day, when I hear of someone visiting Phoenix, I always recommend Oregano's.  Also when someone mentions they're from Phoenix, I mention Oregano's and their eyes light up.  So I know I'm not the only one that feels this way about them.  Keep up the good work and I look forward to one day returning to one of your establishments.",

    "text": "My daughter and I thought we would try a new pizza establishment this evening and ended up at Oregano's.  We couldn't have made a better decision!  First, we were greeted by staff outside as they opened the door and welcomed us in.  The bar is in the front but not loud or rowdy and no smoking (a BIG plus!).  Though a Sat. eve, we were seated in a timely manner, after being given a choice of seat locations.  Our waitress promptly arrived and filled our drink order, then advised her shift was over and Juan B. would take care of us the remainder of our stay.  Juan stopped by our table quickly, answering questions about the menu and making small talk.  He allowed us a couple more minutes to decide as he attended other patrons.  After placing our order, Juan made sure to let us know one of the dishes we ordered would take 30-min. so we didn't think they forgot us.  He stopped by our table a couple of times prior to our meal arriving to refill our glasses and see if we needed anything.  The food was warm/hot upon arrival and very tasty.  The portions were enough for 2-4 people so naturally we boxed the remainder to take home.  Throughout, Juan was attentive, pleasant and made our visit even that much more enjoyable.  It is rare to visit any establishment nowadays where the customer is made to feel welcome and appreciated, the food is good and prices reasonable.  I think Oregano's is our new go-to place for a meal out and always, we will ask for Juan!",

    "text": "I'm from the Pacific Northwest but my family frequently visits the Phoenix area. Every time we do, we stop into an Oregano's (the ones on Cactus and Camelback, in particular). We have never had a truly negative experience: the only complaint I've ever had was slow service, and that was due to how busy the restaurant was at that time. The food is always fantastic. The Bollo Pasta is HUGE (even though it's unlimited, you won't need more than one order!) and really yummy. I also love the Pasta Basta with sausage. The sausage is super spicy and flavorful, and the skin gets nice and crispy. It's AMAZING. Speaking of sausage, I'd also recommend the Famous Chicago Italian Sausage sandwich... the provolone helps tame the spiciness of the sausage, making it a great combination. And, of course you can't go wrong with the pizza. Perfect proportion of crust to toppings. As for the atmosphere, it is so much fun! The vintage decor is awesome, the waitstaff is very friendly, and the restaurants are always lively. If you haven't tried Oregano's yet, you have to give it a try! The long wait is definitely worth it.",

We had to wait outside since there was a long wait at the time and one of the employees came out to give samples in the 100 degree weather.  When we tried the samples we already knew that this place was serious.  Definitely worth the wait and if you want to avoid the lines I would recommend calling in and taking it to go since there were a lot of patrons going that route as it seemed.",

One, I usually go during the off hours. It might get crowded while I'm there, but my family and I rarely have to wait to be seated.  Two, we basically order the same things over and over, which is why we only go there when we're craving something specific. Oddly enough, it's not their pizza. Oregano's has some great pastas, meatball subs, and chicken wings.   Their services ranges from lacking to pretty good. I haven't had anyone yet that was horrible, the worst was just negligent and had to be flagged down for refills or extra napkins, but she wasn't rude or anything like that. I enjoy it overall, but probably because I don't actually eat the pizza as the few times I did I found it decent, but not worth the price. I do recommend it, but not for the reasons most people would probably go to it for.",

The dish is made with spiral pasta, poblano peppers, of which I could find none, southwestern cheeses, tomatoes and jalapenos (neither of which I had come with the dish) and the whole conglomeration was just awful.  The flavor was just not good, especially with the shredded chicken.  I thought maybe it would be better warmed up for lunch today but I was wrong.  This dish misses the mark and I won't be ordering it again.    This place still gets 4 stars because their thin crust pizza is to-die-for.

We had bruschetta, which is great if you like lots of garlic. We also got the pesto ziti, which was kind of lacking in flavor. Needed more basil or salt or something. Also got the spinach salad which was huge and delicious and perfect. The Italiano lasagna could have used more beef for me; it seemed to be too heavily overweighted in cheese.

A relatively early dinner (5:30) on a Friday night required a 20 minute wait for a table.  Not bad, but plan ahead.  The service is outstanding.  They have the happiest employees I've seen in a restaurant.  Seriously, these people could work at Disneyland.  Our party of six had thin crust pizza, a junior meatball sandwich, the baked zitti, rigatoni and angel hair pasta.  We also shared a fried calamari appetizer. The calamari was very good.  It's battered, then baked, then pan fried in garlic butter.  Served with marinara sauce.   Two of us shared a pizza.  It was OK but a bit oily for my liking.  Maybe the deep dish or pan pizza would have been a better choice. All of the pasta dishes were excellent. The junior meatball sandwich was pretty big and comes with fries.  You might want to think twice before you order the full sandwich.  They only have one dessert choice here - they only need one dessert choice here!  The Original Pizza Cookie is available in chocolate chip or white chocolate macadamia nut.  We ordered both and shared.  DAMN! Half cooked cookie dough and ice cream - who knew it was so good?  Did I mention the service?  Will we be back - yep!",

The service is always very friendly and on the ball. They have great specialty drinks and a small but good selection of beer in draft. Some of the food can take a while to cook, but the server has always warned us if we ordered one of these dishes.  You won't be disappointed with what you order at Oregano's. I tend to favor the diablo shrimp pasta and any of the pizzas. Seriously, any of them.   Save room for the pizza cookie! it truly is the best one out of all the other fakes that try and make it.",

Service was slow and the bartenders walked by several times and didn't even ask how we're doing or if we needed anything... It took forever to get the check and even longer to get the box. We ordered some garlic cheese bread and it came out with the rest of the food we ordered instead of just an appetizer... We ordered a caesar salad and at first they sent the wrong one and we had no idea.. We wondered why it tasted so weird but then the staff (all three waiters) just stood there and stared at us eating it since it was the wrong one like we were criminals or something. My friend asked what was wrong and they said we had the wrong salad... As if it was our fault they brought it out to us. The wings we ordered were cold and hard which is why we even came back here again tonight. I will not be back at this location ever.",

From guacamole to chicken wings. But it all tasted fine.   The main issue was the timing of everything. It was an hour and fifteen before the main dishes came. They ran out of cups and brought our refills in paper cups but the straws were plentiful.   Very weird smell in the hallway towards the bathroom.   The homemade ice cream at the end was wonderful, not to be upstaged by the warm cookie.   Our meal ended with the waitress dumping copious amounts of fortune cookies onto the table out of a plastic bag. Fortune cookies. At an Italian restaurant.",

Our waitress greeted us after a couple of minutes and was super friendly. We already knew what we wanted to order and she advised me the o'zone takes about 20 minutes. I was cool with that so we proceeded with our order. Then it all kind of went downhill. We waited much much longer than 20 minutes. Tables came and left in the time it took for us to receive our meal and pay quickly after.   Our waitress was doing the best she could. She was constantly running from table to table and did check in on us, thanking us for our patience. She was clearly texting her best but it was a pretty steady night. The thing is, every time I've been dragged in here it's been the same situation.   The reason this review goes to a two.. the food. It's not even that good. I'm sorry, I've tried to like it, I really have, but it's all pretty blah and never sits well with me either. With many other chain Italian restaurants around, this place just doesn't stand out.",

    "text": "First time trying this place and it didn't really start off impressing me. I got here around noon and was sealed immediately on the porch area. Our waiter came around pretty quickly and took our drink order. Since this was our first time trying this place out, we needed a few minutes to look over the menu.   I decided on the Zany Ziti which is ziti in a bread bowl. The pasta was delicious, however I wouldn't suggest trying to eat the bread bowl as it was really hard, dry, and had no taste to it so I ended up not eating any of it. The Zany Ziti came with a slice of garlic bread which was soft and seasoned well.   My reason for giving this place a 3 star is because of the long wait from when we were seated to when our food came out. We got here right before the big rush came and we still waited 45 minutes for our food. Was about to ask where it was when they finally brought it out. Large groups that came after I did got their food way before my food, so obviously food wasn't brought out in the order that they were placed.   Our waiter was very pleasant and very knowledgeable of the menu. He came around often to check up on us, to refill drinks, make sure food was how we liked it, etc. When it came to pay, he was quick to bring our check and cash us out.   Will come back again, but probably try and come during the week so not to get caught up in the weekend rush.",

From pasta to sandwiches, wings and salads Oreganos offers something for everyone, providing you have an appetite.  While the service is always solid, and the food is great be aware that whether you are coming on a date, or a business party, there is going to be a wait at most times of the day. Also be prepared for a loud interior atmosphere.  As for the food, i've yet to be disappointed. I would go out of my way to recommend the Wings and The Stuffed Mushrooms however. Like getting seated, their pizzas take time, but they are also humungous like everything else. Great for feeding a large group with an appetizer or large salad on the side.  This is a great place to come beat the AZ heat, but it has it's quirks when it comes to wait time and serving size. While they don't deliver themselves they are an awesome place to get something picked up by Uber Eats or to come grab yourself on your way home for a nice hot and filling meal.",

Our bartenders Kristen and Juan were awesome and made sure we tried the best house cocktails, and then recommended a chips and guac sort of appetizer but with pizza crust! A bread lovers dream.  Also, make sure you get the cookie/ice cream dessert!!  Thank you Oregano's, Juan and Kristen, I will be back on my next trip!",

I went with my coworker during our lunch break and ordered The Turkey Stuffed sandwich and it tasted pretty horrible. The flavor of the turkey was odd and the potato chips were stale. I ate a few bites and that was that. The waitress seemed concerned but I simply didn't have time to send the food back or complain as I was on my lunch break. My coworker had a slice of pizza and a salad. She ate just a couple bites of the pizza and said it was horrible but she raved about her salad. We also shared a pizza cookie and it was ok. Overall we would pass on the food going forward but the waitress provided pretty good customer service which is why I'm giving this location 3 stars.",

That said, one of my very favorite people loves this place and, what I think I finally figured out is, he orders the right thing (and it's not exactly \"Italian\"). So, from now on, when I go to Oregano's, I'm getting what he gets: Alfredo The Dark with chicken. I had been reluctant because I'm not a white sauce gal, but the sauce application is actually relatively light and the cheese is more pronounced. The poblano and southwestern cheese blend are what set this dish apart. ($8.99)   Of course, the pizookie is (almost) always a hit. They do need a few more minutes than they think in the new, faster ovens, though...",

While their regular stuffed pizza is good, their stuffed pizza using their Big Rig sauce (from their Big Rig pasta) in place of the normal pizza sauce makes it something you can't get anywhere else. It makes the pizza a little creamy and gives it a bit of a spicy kick. The server is always a little confused when we order it this way, but they always comment that it looks amazing when they bring it out. And it always is.   If you somehow have room left for dessert, their pizza cookies, slightly underdone, are the perfect way to end the meal.",

There's no better way to celebrate your birthday than a delicious 1/2 pound of chocolate chip, peanut butter chocolate, or white chocolate macadamia nut cookie dough baked a topped with three scoops of vanilla ice cream!  Well, there is, but only with Oregano's as a part of your special day (especially as it is FREE on your birthday).    Funny thing...I went to Oregano's last night and didn't even get the Original Pizza Cookie.  That is because I was filled up on a salad and pizza, both shared with a friend.  My friend and I enjoyed a delicious Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad (with chicken in it) though apparently then can substitute pinto beans for chicken for vegetarians.  If there's just two of you, get the Jr. instead of the full salad as it is already HUGE as a Jr.    We also ordered a pan pizza with several toppings.  We were warned that it would take 45-60 minutes for the pizza to come out and were pleased to see it show up in a half hour.  Delicious but quite filling pizza!  Made for great leftovers though.    I have also enjoyed thin crust pizzas and several of the bottomless pastas in the past.  While sometimes the wait times can be longer than other times, the estimated wait times are usually pretty accurate.  Parking at the Paradise Valley location is a breeze!  Definitely a pizza place that visitors to Phoenix should go to regardless of which location, as it is only an Arizona chain.",

They're presented with a wad of pizza dough to keep them busy for what can be a pretty long wait for food. If you order the kids pizza, you can get them started eating ahead of the adults. For about $3, the kids can opt for a simple pepperoni, diamond cut, while the adults can select something more flavorful. For dessert a warm panned cookie with ice cream to share for just five bucks.  This location, in a building originally built to be a restaurant, is not as unique as some more creative converted locations, either a plus or a minus depending on your perspective. There is an outdoor patio with a very effective heating system if it's cold outside.   The only problem, really, is that wait times can be long. We arrived at 5:15 p.m. on a Wednesday and still couldn't be seated immediately. That's Oregano's, I guess.",

I usually avoid this location because of previous disappointing visits however, I have family living nearby and I hadn't eaten all day so, my son and I stopped in for some pizza & wings. It was a couple of Saturdays back around 4pm. The place was crowded but, not slammed. Hence, no wait to get seated.  We ordered our usual thin pizza & buffalo wings. Wings came out rather quickly (15 minutes) and they were fantastic! Crispy, meaty, saucy, the whole package. That's when we should have stopped. The pizza must have taken and additional 45-50 from the time the wings were served to hit our table. Okay, I know it takes time but, adding it up, close to 70 minutes to get a pizza? Still, it was hot and looked great. They just forgot the flavor. Bland, really bland. We had pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom and still nothing. I never salt my pizza but, I had no choice. Salt, pepper, red pepper, anything to give it some needed zing. I would have sent it back but, I was running on empty and was under the gun to get back across town so, sending it back was not an option. To boot, service was marginal at best. Put it this way - over an hour at the table and I had two glasses of wine - I would of had another but, the server rarely checked on us. We love Oregano's - absolutely love it! However, judging by some of the reviews and out history here, this location needs a refresher course on Oregano's pizza 101..",

The sauce was thin and runny and the pasta was dry and starchy. I'm not master chef, but I can definitely say that I can certainly make a better dish than that! The bread wasn't even that good, but it was honestly the only thing I even sort of enjoyed. Not sure if I'll return,  but I know I'll absolutely never order this gross rendition of Alfredo ever ever again",

We called the manager, Mike, who told us you can't get sick from salad. He also told us he needed at least two complaints before he could open an investigation. We gave up on him and called corporate. The gentleman we spoke with said that was definitely not the policy, that one complaint opened an investigation. He offered to put us in touch with the insurance company to file a claim, but we only wanted to try to prevent others from getting sick, especially young children. I would give this negative stars if that were possible. Never again for us!",

    "text": "BAD SERVICE. FOOD POISONING. UNDERCOOKED FOOD.  Health grade: F  The moment our party waited for over 90 minutes for seats, was disastrous (were told 30-45min). Advice for the hostess, do not sugarcoat times. The Yelp app was also wrong on the updated waitlist times.   At the time of seating, the hostess called our group from outside and sped walked to the table to place menu's down without anyone following her. She walked so fast, we had to ask her walking back towards us, where the heck she put us.  Once seated, the waiter (Gus), informed our table he'll be with us in a moment - as he takes off without drink/appetizer orders. Meanwhile, half of our table did not sit due to the seats (and table) being covered with food. I know this isn't Steak 44, but nobody wants to sit on fresh spaghetti. Half our table stood for SIX MINUTES until Gus returned, questioning if everything is OK. We requested someone to come clean the cushions. Gus returns 2 minutes later with a hand towel. FYI - when using a hand towel, use HOT water not cold as it'll dry faster.  Service Issue: Although upset with the service, we treated our waiter with respect and positivity. The waiter did opposite with us. We waited on drinks refills for a period of 15 minutes. Previously when dining with Oregano's, the child in our group were offered dough to make their own pizza. This time dining, the waiter did not offer this; however, he offered the pizza dough to 2 children behind us. Perhaps because they only had one more additional child than us.   As we've waited 90 minutes in the heat outside, we were prepared to order our entire meal. As an appetizer, we ordered zucchini and wings. We specifically requested the wings to be EXTRA CRISPY and requested to cook for an additional 15 minutes. The wings came out 10 minutes later. I'm no mathematician, but how can the wings be served, faster than the additional request time? The wings were completely undercooked, ultimately suffering from food poisoning.  As an entree, we ordered the chicken parmesan. The chicken, noodles and cheese were stale. Curious why he delivered the dish saying, \"be careful, hot plate.\" Nothing was hot about it. This dish had been sitting on the counter for delivery for several minutes or intentionally left to harden.   As an entree, we ordered the Stuffed Pizza. We were told it would take approximately one hour to make. The waiter cautioned our table on ordering this as if it's a burden to put in the request to the kitchen staff. We placed the order anyhow, but upon delivery to the table, it appeared to be a pan pizza. We questioned our waiter - if this is the PAN pizza opposed to the STUFFED pizza. He assured us it was stuffed and informed us on how it was made. The disappointing factor, Oregano's online menu (and Yelp) pictures, the dish is filled to the top with ingredients. Our dish was filled half way with the crust noticeably visible. The problem didn't stop there, the pan-stuffed pizza was COLD and the pepperoni was NOT cooked. You're meaning to tell me, the wait time on a pizza is over an hour - to come out cold??  We will never dine with Oregano's restaurant, this location or any other. Caution and urge all the contact the Maricopa County Health Inspector if you've also experienced food poisoning.",

    "text": "I was introduced to Oregano's when I first moved to Phoenix, and it has been one of my go-to restaurants ever since. Their appetizers and pasta dishes are huge! The guacatony is a favorite appetizer for my husband and me. We usually split a guacatony and a small pizza.....and it's more than plenty! Their pizzas never disappoint. We tried their Chicago-style pizza once when we weren't in a hurry (they let you know up front that it takes a while to bake) and it was really good too. Their pizookie dessert is dirt cheap (only $4.99) and is by far the best pizookie of anywhere I've ever been. Oregano's has mastered the perfect balance of cooked vs. undercooked of the cookie. I have to say, if I had written this review when I was on a vegan diet a few months ago, I would not have been able to give a good review because they have virtually nothing that's vegan. They also appear to not have any gluten-free options. In general, it may not be the best place to go if you have food or allergy restrictions because they don't seem to offer modifications. My only restriction is that I'm a vegetarian, and they have plenty of options for vegetarians.",

He came back to take our drink order ten minuets after we sat down and it took another 5-7 to bring our drinks back to us.   He never came to check on us, despite being next to the bar we had to literally flag him down. His last trip pass was to drop off the check (arrived at 5ish, departure 7ish) even though we had given no indication we were ready and we again had to Flag him down to split it.  We waited a fair/excessive amount of time for drinks and to even order the other appetizer. Again he seemed annoyed that we were ordering a second app and a second round the of drinks. Our tab is was almost $100 and our server acted as if us being there was a huge inconvenience.  Ok food, good drinks, POOR service.",

It was decided to close the shop and have a fun Ferris Bueller's Day off.  This location seems a little smaller the some of the others and can get very busy. They usually have some pretty cool jazz music playing or something that will make you want to tap your foot while you wait.  Usually get one of the the Real Big Salads or a tasty and delicious Thin Crust Pizza. Could not resist ordering the Numero One-O Stuffed Pizza on my last visit. Decided to get it TO GO and it must of weighed ten or twenty pounds.  Food is always pretty tasty and the service is friendly and attentive. Really like their homemade sausage and the Rib Eye Salad. Looking forward to trying out the famous Original Pizza Cookie with Ice Cream for the topper on our next visit.  Located in the PV Mall parking lot in the SE corner next to the candy store. The restaurants in this parking lot are always changing but this one is definitely a keeper. PIZZA ME BABY!  3.75 STARS",

The pizza is made from scratch so it usually takes about 45 minutes, but it's well worth the wait. This restaurant is extremely popular so there is usually a wait for a table anyways, and they will let you put your pizza order in early.   In addition to the deep dish pizza, they also have some excellent thin crust pizzas as well, most of them are very unique but excellent. I also really like their Pablo Picasso salad. It is a hearty salad that is topped with chicken, cheese, onions, chips, etc. The full size salad is huge! I can hardly ever finish it. They also have amazing garlic cheese bread. I miss their big ol' ravioli, it used to be my favorite, please bring it back! And please expand to San Diego! There isn't any good pizza here!!  Make sure you save room for the pazooki! They offer giant half-baked cookies topped with ice cream OMG! To die for!",

The atmosphere was welcoming although it was loud-couldn't expect a private diner either though. The customer service was good and the waitresses were friendly for being so busy. The noise level was loud but besides that it was a great experience. The way they serve the pizza on the rack on the table was new and exciting to me! I would have loved to try other pizzas but one was enough for the two of us and we had to leave with no room for dessert.",

I brought my young niece and nephew (after driving to three separate restaurants for breakfast that were mobbed), and we finally conceded and settled for lunch.   The restaurant was probably 1/4 full, and there were at least two young waitpersons standing nearby, talking and laughing. After some time passed, they were still at it talking and laughing. More time passed. I established eye contact with 2 servers. We were still ignored. Mind you, nobody had even been by to get our drink order. Nobody had even said someone would be with us soon. More time passed. I may have been more patient had I not already been very hungry with two hungry kids in tow. However, that's a compelling reason to go to a restaurant in the first place. Last I checked, that's how they make their money.  I've never left a restaurant because I was ignored. The manager was very apologetic and offered to serve us herself, but I wasn't in the mood to watch these girls yakking and ignoring others as I ate.  If I could, I wouldn't have even rated this place any stars. Newsflash: the amount of your tip is heavily influenced by good customer service or the lack thereof, 'ladies.'",

That being said, it would be nice to see a meat/fish and veggie dish on the menu.  Ambiance: -casual pizzeria Italiano joint -patio outside is heated in the winter, misters in the summer -slightly loud when busy, especially inside -populated by all types of groups: families, groups of friends, etc. I was surprised to see a lot of 20-30 somethings.  Food: -primarily a pizza and pasta menu, very few options otherwise -one dessert: the pizookie -started with the Big Bruschetta Authentico ($7.49): Big is right. The bread is so large, it's difficult to bite into. The bruschetta mixture was tasty, big hunks of tomatoes and garlic. -I ordered the \"Lady is a Scampi\" (*snort*... $14.99) with mushrooms added. 5 stars for this dish, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and the chipotle scampi sauce was delectable. Enough for 2 meals. Comes with 2 breadsticks.  Drinks: -we ordered a bottle of Snapdragon Riesling (~$19) instead of paying by the glass, I'd recommend this for any party of 2 or more.   Service: -no complaints -5 minute wait time on a Sunday evening for the patio  An elevation from the traditional chain restaurant, if only slightly. That Scampi, tho!",

They have some good beers on draft which is a good way to start off.  The menu is huge, and we started with the garlic bread.  It's only around $4 and it's literally an entire loaf, and very good.   We went with a medium Pan pizza, as we didn't want to wait 40 min for the Deep Dish.  The medium pan was tasty and very filling.  While it won't make you forget Chicago pizza, it's a worthy substitute.  They had a deep dish cookie dessert which looked great, but we were too full for that.",

When we first sat down outside on the patio seating, he said he'll be our server and he'll be back to take our order. At the time he had a few tables so we weren't impatient. After he finally comes to take our orders for drinks, it was long enough for us to go over the whole menu and we were ready to order. So we placed some orders and was still indecisive on the entres so we placed what we knew we wanted. It took about 10 to 15 minutes to get our drinks served to us, then as more to me went on I had to ask where our salad was. Finally after another 5 to 10 minutes he gave us our food. Next thing you know when we wanted to ask for cheese for the salad he was no where to be found. When he wasn't paying all of his attention to the table with five guys right next to us I finally got his attention to get some cheese for our salads. We were enjoying our meal, and I noticed there was a bug crawling in my beer. When I got his attention, He somehow copped an attitude with us. I ordered a \"bigger\" blue moon and drank 1/3 of the beverage. He said well since you drank \"this much\" I'll fill it back up to here okay? Than walked off. I was stunned he even said that. So I waited for the beer. He returned with a pint glass instead. No apologies, no sincerity, nothing. So the bill comes around and he charge me for the \"bigger\" glass. And I simply asked why was I charged when he returned with the pint. He argues with me and said you drank enough to put it in a pint glass. I stated that I didn't put the bug in my drink and I said I'd pay for the pint but not the bigger glass. Before this, normally when we're done with the meal we've always had servers pack our leftovers. He asked the two tables right next to us if he could pack their dinners. He left our boxes at our table and said I'll be back for the check. So not only did he argue with us, he didn't even provide the simple courtesy of packing our food. He was rude, never look at us or paid any attention. He was too worried about everyone except our table. If we ever even think about going back we will request a new server if we happen to get him again. Very disappointing.",

They obviously have amazing wings, pizza, etc. But the pasta had huge jumbo shrimp, served butterflied, in a spicy creamy sauce with linguine. The sauce is an amazing marriage of spicy and smoky.

I mean, I get its the name of your establishment but calm it down. It's making the food unenjoyable because we CAN'T TASTE ANY OTHER FLAVORS - When the waiter boxed our appetizer he used his hands - The lettuce in the side salad was browned along the edges - The Italian Meats stuffed \"calzone\" I got was sprinkle with small dices of pepperoni and packed full of five different cheeses. Which, I suppose is fine but I'd prefer to not eat a plate of just melted cheese.  Verdict: Won't be going back, probably won't be ordering food to go any more either.

I mean for F's sake can they make these places bigger than college dorm room so the wait is somewhat shorter then the next coming of Jesus Christ himself.  And speaking of the wait, can the 18 year old hoochies that work that ever brain taxing job of taking names and delivering menus actually estimate what the real wait time is.  I have been told 30 mins to wait 75, other times I called and told 30 mins only to walk up 2 mins later and be told 60 mins.  From now on I'll only get this as take out b/c dealing with everything else about this place ruins the experience which is pretty much eating the most amazing italian dishes I've had.  Also note to the manager; it's summer in Arizona.  Keep the misters on the the patio on at all times!!!!.  I don't care if a family of buffalo sized snooty Scottsdale folk is complaing that their table is damp.  As you could tell by the overall applause by everyone on the patio when they were turned back on, the family that resembled their meatballs were in the minority when wanting the misters off .",

I was told it would be 30 minutes for take out ( no where to sit waiting for it ) I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir to kill the time. Crunched standing in a corner hovering over some poor people trying to eat. After 15 min of waiting the take out gal approached me with a glass of WHITE wine... I explained I ordered Pinot Noir this wasn't even Pinot Grigio?  She apologized and took it back.  10 more min I get the manager who tells me my Pinot Noir is $2.00 more so they will add that to my credit card?! I had to wait another 10 minutes before I got my glass of wine by then my food was ready.  I can get  that they are new and  they haven't got some of the wines straight.  What I don't get is making me wait and still charging me an extra $2.00, its the principle of charging me. If the food wasn't so good I wouldn't bother going back.  When I do it will be called in take out only. Customer service is what sets apart places these days.  I wonder once they sold their company out if  their customer service didn't go with.  The Pablo Picasso chicken salad and Pazzokie are amazing I have to give them that credit!",

We waited roughly 15 minutes before our server decided to greet us. we placed our entire order drinks, apps, entree at once, not wanting to wait another 15 minutes to order. well the drinks took 15 minutes to get to the table anyway. Dinner came roughly a half hour later, all at once. No apps first or anything. I myself work in the business and know its really not that hard to course a meal. Anyway i was really disappointed as bad service can ruin a meal, and i was looking forward to this dinner. To be honest the food wasnt even that great. guess ive been having better pizza recently, as ive been sticking to the Family owned restaurants... If you want the combined Ambience,food, and service, try Brugos in Cave Creek, They're great!!",

My daughter and I then moved closer to the door, the hostess came up 10 minutes later, still no table-but she did ask if we wanted to sit outside, even though I requested inside from the get go. Along with my daughter was my 5 month old granddaughter, so outside was out of the question, I politely declined.Then I was quoted another 10-15 minutes, at this point both my daughter and I were fed up. We had waited over an hour and had seen two couples that arrived when we had leaving already, leftovers in hand. Upset about the even longer wait we placed a to-go order. We were quoted 15-20 minutes. We didn't get our food until 45 minutes later...........As if we hadn't already wasted enough of our time, when we arrived home our pasta seemed to have no sauce!! I will not be returning to this new location, the service was horrible, not to mention one of the hostesses shirts was way too small and I could see her belly, not appropriate for the work environment. I guess I'll stick to my usual Camelback location.",

Replacement order had raviolis with no cheese in them at all because they bubbled out (too long in the deep frier).  They just can't get it right.  And at the end of it all, the entrees came before the fixed appetizer came, yet I was never offered a comp, dessert, etc. for the major PITA.    Parking is insufficient here at the location itself, but if you rely on the huge mall parking then things aren't too bad.  It's just a miracle how this chain finds so many places with insufficient parking relative to the seating size inside.  Hit the Shea location if you want their tasty food without all of the problems that this place has.",

We chose to sit at the bar and it was a great choice.  \"Rick\" our server was the most efficient and quickest server I have ever seen.  Rick gave us suggestions that were perfect.  My friend and I shared a House Salad because Rick told us that it was HUGE and should be shared and he was certainly right.  The salad was GREAT!  We each ordered the Flag Lasagna - probably the best lasagna I have ever eaten and the garlic bread was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT - even ordered more.  Desert was a hot cookie with vanilla ice cream - a perfect ending to the meal.  Black Iced Tea is terrific. All of this plus drinks and our bill was under $50!!  We will be back many times.  I have already made my family aware that my birthday dinner is to be at Oregano's.  All of the staff were great!",

The place was packed, Saturday afternoon about 1P. We had a genial server Jesus who was there promptly, efficient with the orders and attentive to the drinks refills. I had no been there before and was astounded at the size of the portions. The salads, pies and pasta dishes are huge. I noticed the kiddies get a blob of dough to snack on and play with depending on their ages. We got the warm artichoke dip which was very good and the dipping strips were tasty, possibly a little too much cheese along with the dip, but good. We had a deep-dish that was really good  - slices were much the size of what one gets for a lasagne. Topped with sausage, peppers, pepperoni and mushrooms. Definitely get enough to take home and enjoy again. Every table around us ordered some dessert, apparently quite popular but we were stuffed. I found it pleasant, albeit loud, and people seemed to be really happy dining there. Bar was filled and you can dine there too.  Good experience.",

Talk about great customer service of course we will be back. I greatly enjoyed my pizza and can't wait to have another one very soon.

I ordered the stuffed riga tony & it was really good & the helping was a decent portion, enough for leftovers. My husband ordered a mexican style pizza which was big enough for 2 so I had a slice & it was delicious!

As for my previous visits to various Oreganos locations... The guacamole appetizer is ginormous and tastes great. My friends rave about the drinks, but I was in a wine mood today and enjoyed the house merlot. I've had the pesto pasta bake before, and it almost has too much cheese if that's even possible.

And i had to ask for an extra plate 4 times!  Server never came by to apologize for the long wait. The worst! So we got here at 7, 30 min wait for a table, food served at 8:40.  Also, they changed the Italian Wedding Soup recipe. Its awful!  And serving it in a bread bowl is asinine!",

The service was great, everything came out quick. We all got different things and shared so I got to try the guacatony, Brussel sprouts, and a pizza I can't remember the name of but it had mushrooms, spinach, and garlic. The guacatony was good but I wasn't like as crazy about it like I know some other people are. But it was tasty! The Brussel sprouts were not bad, some were a teeny bit too burned, but other ones were perfect. The pizza was my favorite! I got the 14in and nearly finished it to my surprise so I'm glad I wasn't splitting it haha. Tasted fresh, the veggies on there were yummy! Sometimes places put too much spinach on their pizza but this had the perfect amount. Was a little pricey, but not terrible. Overall I left happy!",

I understand is hot in Arizona, however the space was cool and there was no reason why I had my child point out you can see a maxi pad coming out of a girls shorts. That is how short they wear it.   This is a hygiene issue!!!   A dress code gives us a standard for our professional appearance. It establishes a standard that the average employee is comfortable with and can, with a few changes, understand and implement.   How can anyone allow this kind of inappropriate action? I get the girls need better tips, and need to wear this to get better money by the men. I found my sever very professional and yes, he was a man but we tipped him for his great service very well. Not because of what he wore.!! I am really looking into finding the laws in AZ that protect people from this un clean environment. We had women rears all over the table. This is not Hooters and if my family wanted to see butt cheeks we would go there. I am hoping that all the oreganos are not like this.   Please clean up your gals! The women who had jeans and looked very professional, I salute you for not needing to be naked to get great tips!! I have pictures that I will be posting so the public can see. If Yelp allows me to do so!",

Our server was really nice and attentive for the most part. We had wanted to get a deep dish pizza but were told it would be about an hour wait. Our server told us that we could have preordered the pizza while we waited for our table but we weren't aware we could do that ahead of time. We decided to get thin/pan crust.  The pizza was awesome! So far it is my favorite pizza in the Phoenix area. I will go back for a deep dish pizza when we have more time to wait.",

I let him know it was okay but that they usually do it for me so then he said he would. He made it obvious that he wasn't happy about it though. I felt super uncomfortable with the conversation. He kept insinuating that I wasn't going to be happy with the amount of salad I was getting and persuaded me to pay for extra chicken AND the bigger salad because there wasn't going to be enough. I bought the extra chicken, and it turned out to be less chicken than I would normally get. They gave me three small sauce containers of chicken when I usually get a bowl of it with my salad. I feel like they purposely messed up my order.  I just felt the experience was not as it always is when I order from there and I won't be visiting this location on cactus anymore.",

We had ubered here so when the waiter asked if we'd like another drink we said yes. That's when the manager came and yelled at us that we were only allowed two premium drinks. We were totally embarrassed. An hour later the pizza arrived. After the first bite I realized it was warm not hot. Being a chef I always have a thermometer in my purse. The temperature was 137 degrees. Obviously it's set in the window for quite a while to get to that temperature. The nasty manager did comp our pizza. So we left the server a 20 dollar tip. What we would have paid for the pizza and vowed never to return. I don't know what all the hype is about this restaurant. The food wasn't that good",

The server promptly took it back but we waited for about 25 minutes and were finally told that the server accidentally canceled the order instead of resubmitting it, we weren't happy but agreed to wait for the replacement.  We finished our lunches while our poor friend waited but she eventually received the correct order.    What struck me about this experience was that the manager immediately came over, apologized, and told us lunch would be on them - for all of us.  I don't know about you but my experience is that it's the customer the usually has to alert the manager and even then, it's not guaranteed that you will be offered anything other than an excuse (this infuriates me btw).  A response like this is usually reserved for high end spots where you're paying for great service via the meal prices.  The food is consistently fresh and good, and I'm extremely pleased with how they handled this situation.",

We had a large group, 15 I think, and it was a Friday, and they don't take reservations, so it was a poor choice on that friends behalf.  We were quoted an hour and a half wait.  We waited, and waited, and waited.   We were seated about 2 and a half hours later.  While we were waiting a woman who I assume was a manager took our order so that we wouldn't have to wait for the food once seated.  We still waited, apparently she forgot to tell the waitress exactly what was going on and took off.  Appetizers came out with meals, stuff took forever.  And the food, not even worth it.  Our waitress was a gem though, completely got stuck with a screwed up situation that management and the hostesses should have handled better.  She did her best to make up for the crap start to the night.",

We enjoy background music when eating however the music is so loud that the people in the patio, where we were sitting, we're all shouting to be heard over the music. It was so noisy that I couldn't wait to leave. Lastly the garlic bread was cold and tasteless also. Large portions don't necessarily mean good food. Lastly the service was just mediocre.

    "text": "Stay away from this Oregano's location! I've been eating Oregano's for 15 years; mostly at the Scottsdale & Shea location, but also in Tucson and Flagstaff. I've been to this new Oregano's five times because it's a bit closer than the Scottsdale & Shea location. I've had problems every time. Burnt pizza, under-cooked pizza, long waits picking up pizza, miss matched toppings, impossible to cut, cardboard-like crust etc. I ordered two pan pizzas and one thin crust tonight (3/1/13). I came in at 6 pm to pick up the pizza. They came out and told me the pizza was completely burnt.  Before asking whether or not I still wanted it or even showing me the pizza, they apologized and were already cooking new pizzas for us which were ready by 6:30. After complaining that the thin pizza was no longer hot, the staff gave it to us for free. When we began eating the pan pizza we discovered that the two thick pizzas were completely under-cooked. Of course, the thin pizza was cold due to sitting for 30 min while waiting for the thick pizzas.   Because the pan pizza was hot at the time, a few of our guests tried eating the pizza to be polite. Due to the under-cooked crust, it was doughy and disgusting.  One guest in particular is now having stomach issues after eating a slice of it. We will NEVER visit this location again. We will gladly drive the extra 20 minutes to the Shea location since we do still love Oregano's. However, we will avoid the PV location like the plague!",

    "text": "Food and service are pretty good, but make sure you have plenty of time, as the place is always packed and there is a wait. Apps are pretty good (love the calamari) and salads are awesome. I am not a fan of the 45min wait for a deep-dish pizza, but the thin crust I had was pretty solid and I'm not a thin crust person. All in all, the food is good, but this place is too much of a time commitment, so I probably won't go very often. I've tried it 2x and been there over 1.5 hrs both times.",

    "text": "We religiously dine at several Oregano locations throughout the valley and love it however if you like Oreganos skip this location at all costs.  Horrible service, unorganized and unprofessional staff, music twice as loud as other locations and wait times for your food three times longer than other locations.  A real bummer no excuse all the other locations are just as busy or busier.  We had to wait until our pizza was cold and almost gone before we could get a servers attention to grate some cheese on it.  Other locations offer it immediatly when the pie hits your table.  We waited 45 minutes for salads and a pizza and then had to tell them which ingredients were missing.  If I owned this location I would sure notice that all other locations get 4+ stars and this place is below average with some terrible reviews wake up ownership wake up management this location is tarnishing your fine reputation!",

    "text": "Very reasonable prices....large portions for a good price! The thin crust pizza, garlic cheese bread, bowl o pasta, chicken Caesar salad and pizza cookie are my favs! Only dish I have tried and not liked is the shrimp scampi. It was a bit spicy and the type of pasta (curly noodle things) I didn't care for. This def a \"safe\" choice with good food and fun atmosphere if you are in charge of picking a place to eat. Oh but I should add service can be slow/it takes awhile for food to come out. It's prob because they are always packed.",

Our server was outstanding keeping us updated with the food and checking on us frequently. I have always loved the Oreganos sense of humor and atmosphere. Pizza was a tad salty but overall the experience was great!",
