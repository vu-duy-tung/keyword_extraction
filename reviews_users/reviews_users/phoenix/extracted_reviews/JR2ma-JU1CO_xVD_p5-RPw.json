Super friendly and helpful with our 3 small children. He's was great bartender as well! After we ate, our kids enjoyed playing on the playground right outside. It was such a fun family time, exciting atmosphere, & great food! We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "This was a horrible experience from beginning to end. We went at lunch and it was almost empty, which is when we should have walked back out, but we didn't.  First, instead of proper napkins they have rolls of brown paper towels like you find in a bathroom on the table. The roll was completely saturated with greasy fingerprints. Disgusting. Whoever thought that was a smart idea should be fired. Talk about unsanitary. But, it gets worse from there.  We sat there for a good five minutes before the waiter finally showed up to take our drink order, and then it was another 10 minutes before be brought out the drinks and took our order. Recall, if you will, the place was almost empty.  Now, to the food. I ordered a platter that included a crab cake, fried fish, onion strings, french fries and bacon wrapped shrimp. The crab cake was cold in the middle. The fried fish and onion rings tasted like old grease. There was almost no fish inside the greasy batter. The bacon wrapped shrimp had so much cheese in it that it was just a greasy ball of cheese. The only thing that was good was the french fries.  I hardly ate anything on the plate. Then the waiter came out to bring out drinks and his hand was bleeding. I had to point out that he got blood all over the salt shaker.  It was just an overall bad experience. The only reason I have 2 stars instead of one was because the manager could tell we were unhappy and came out to talk to us. They took care of the bill, which we did appreciate.  I don't know if all Joe's Crab Shacks are like this, but I don't intend to find out. First and last time.",

    "text": "I tried to give it zero....  The funny thing is, we tried three times to go here but the wait was too long so we went elsewhere. Claim Jumper is right next door. I suggest you jump over to there and save yourself. I wish I had.  Finally got two seats at the bar on the fourth try. Because I don't eat seafood, I was spared what was to come (spoiler alert). SO I get $11 chicken fingers, so dry and bad I just drank my beer. Which was fine.   My copilot ordered the KJ (Kendall Jackson) Steampot. Looked pretty neato with all its netting in there. Had mussels and some crab legs. Well, the seafood wasn't really that steaming and the corn was funny-tasting. My copilot ate the small amount of food ($25+) and we were on our way to a much-desired movie right after. But that was not to be...  Because lurking in the \"not hot enough Steampot was some badddd germ that attacked during the movie and my copilot spent the final hour of the movie worshipping the porcelain god at the Arizona Mills movie theater. And that is not fun. For anyone. After several stops by the side of the road on the way home, we were kind enough to call Joe's and alert them of the possible threat to all of you, the FUTURE DINERS of Joe's.   The response? \"I can't help you. Let me take your number and the general manager will call you tomorrow\". Well, after the level of illness, she retired for the evening. Next day, no call. Third day, we called them and were referred to the main offices in Houston. She spoke to them and was asked \"did you eat an unopened mussel? That can make you sick.\" I won't go on any further, but not only were they unapologetic, but they finally offered her a small gift certificate to THE SAME RESTAURANT. Seriously..  So I called the health department and needless to say, this was not the first call.  So, my advice is: if you go to Joe's, buy a cool tee shirt and watch them dance to Cotton Eyed Joe. They are the only safe activities there. Seafood in the desert is risky anyhow. Go to CA or ME for that. Have some ribs instead....",

We were seated by the windows facing the AZ Mills. The view was nice except a lot of flies kept bothering us. Our order started with the crab nachos. I have had bad experiences with this dish at other locations, and for some unknown reason - I thought this time would be better. The crab topping was cold and way too salty. I suspect the tipping comes premade- so the franchise should conduct some further testing on this product. My wife ordered the fish and chips and I had the endless soup and salad. Both dishes were great. The fish was hot and crispy and my salads were fresh and crisp. I would eat here again - minus the window table and crab nachos.",

Our daughter walked out of the restaurant with the urge to vomit. Now I am on vomit watch for the evening. Very disappointing!!! And one more thing I waitress and I won't say her name even though she wrote it on the paper towel, didn't I refill out of drinks even though the water that tastes like toilet water, didn't offer to give the children refills either, she forgot to give the kids straws, and she didn't do a very good job of responding to the errors of their ways with their nasty food. The manager really didn't have much to offer as far as the nasty food went, other than, \"Oh, I'll give you your money back and I'm sorry you're having a bad experience. Every once in a while, you know, you get that person that gets that really bad experience and I'm sorry it's happening to you.\" Terrible... GROSS experience!",

I guess eating mediocre food in peace isn't good enough.   The disco, flashing lights come on. That's your warning. It's also a free headache, compliments of Joe's. Then, there's clapping, hooraying, twisting, turning to music like the Village People. Absurd.   The food isn't that much better, either. Instead of a headache, you get to walk away with an upset stomach. Maybe it's the combo. Smile and nod. \"Yes, I'd like to order the Bucket of Shrimp with the I Want to Puke Music and Dancing.\"   So, why 2 stars? Beer. It's about beer - all about beer. Since it's Oct, everyone and their mother has a special pumpkin ale available. The one in the pic on the menu looked like the perfect mix to wash down bad service and even badder (yes, i said it) food. The waitress recommended Sam Adam's Oktoberfest instead. She brought me two huge samples of each... they probably both, together, made up a 1/2 pint! I was buzzed before I placed my order!   She was right, though. Sam Adam's is what to order.   I picked at my crab-stuffed shrimp, polished off the steamed veggies and washed the rice down with Oktoberfest that, almost, made the entire experience worth it.   What i wouldn't give right now for another pint of Oktoberfest. (But I'll be damned if I'm going back to Joe's to get it.)",

I'd started out with an ice tea, which I was charged for and took an inch of drink of and asked for a water. The water must have been off today and the server assistant, not my server, said that people have been complaining about the water even though the water is filtered. The small salad wasn't drain very well, it was very watery and they forgot to mix the old lettuce with the new because all we got was the lettuce that had one more day in the fridge. The lobster bisque was really thick like yogurt, it had crumbles rather than pieces of lobster, and tasted really fishy. All three servers assistants made up for the server's lack of eye contact and service. Granted it was a Sunday and kinda of busy the server never made eye contact, only when he dropped off the check and when he thanked us for our patience. Then another messed up thing the server did was tell us after he dropped off our drinks was say he would be right back to take our order. However he took another table that came right after us their drink order, brought their drinks and took their order. He forgot about us had he told us in the beginning that he was running behind it would be a little bit more forgiving. However you can totally tell his manger was berating him because I could see him doing this. Which is never cool.

To top it all, they turn up the music louder every hour or so and the servers do some kind of a performance.  Most everyone in my party ordered a seafood hotpot which was pretty good especially if you like shellfish but it is also a lot of food for one person, best to share.  As I am deathly allergic to shellfish, I told the server about my condition and he was very attentive to my situation!  I ordered mahi mahi and for the price of $15.00 was not totally worth it.  The side veggie dish was overcooked and soggy, amount was very little, \"dirty rice\" as it was called which was rice cooked in sausage and spices was soggy too...  The mahi mahi was okay but definitely not worth the money.  The server was good and attentive, kudos to him for serving a big table of 14!   The place was super busy as it was a Saturday night and our order took more than 30mins to come...  Place not bad but because of the noise level and the slow food service, I may not frequent this place...",

However, living in landlocked Phoenix, Joe's is where I go when I need a crab leg fix without spending a ridiculous amount of money.  I ordered the steamed shrimp appetizer, which was not seasoned AT ALL, although it's supposed to be seasoned with Old Bay.  When I brought that the waitress' attention, she brought out some Old Bay for us to use, and told us that they don't steam the shrimp with the seasoning, they just add it after the fact.  So, they're basically seasoning the shells.  Nice.  For my meal I ordered the Diablo crab leg pot, and that also was poorly seasoned.  All in all, I wasn't impressed.",

I ordered Joe's Classic Steampot and enjoyed it thoroughly. The food was flavorful and the shrimp were a decent size. I also ordered a side of crawfish, but it did not taste right. I suggest waiting until the crawfish season. My husband does not eat seafood and thankfully Joe's has non-seafood food.  I like how they offer different tools to use for the crabs, a bucket to discard shells, a tips on eating crabs placemat, a souvenir and scented wipes for when your done eating.   They were a little busy at the time we came in, but our servers were knowledgeable, and attentive. We also had a manager come to our table once and check on us, which we thought was nice.   We found the atmosphere fun, lively and energetic. I see many people complaining about the loud music and dancing employees. If I'm not in the mood for the experience that Joe's Crab Shack offers then I'll either eat outside, since there is a nice patio, order TO GO, or go another time. This place is the first I've been to with dancing employees. I think this is a fun and casul place to eat with friends and family. This location even has a kids play place.",

The staff stopped and danced which was cute but I wish they had payed a little more attention to their tables instead. I ordered the blackened mahi sandwich.

Our toddler only had 2 meltdowns - amazing since we spent 2 hours there when it was all said and done. They \"miraculously\" found some crab but it must have been 6 years old and at the bottom of their freezer because it was flavorless and over cooked. Luckily the manager comped that part. They overcharged us for the kids meal but I already felt so bad because it was my husband's birthday, that I just paid it so we could leave to get our son to bed. Bathrooms were gross and out of toilet paper. Everything was over salted. They don't even have real butter - just that melted kind that's so gross. If zero stars were an option, that's what I'd give them. Nothing. Yuck. Never going there again.",

Our waitress was named Wei, and she was so cheery and very helpful. I have a dairy allergy and I told her about it while ordering my food. She advised me she would check wirh the kitchen to be sure they could accommodate. What I wanted, I couldn't have lol (because everything tastes better with butter!!!!! I really miss butter!!!) So she brought me out the menu to order something else. As I was browsing,  the manager came out to touch base with me and reassured me that they would do what they could to make me something that I can eat. At this point I am over the moon, because this is not typically the case which is why we don't eat out much.  I asked if The Steamer was a good route and she said she was fairly certain it was with the exception of the garlic bread, but she would again check to avoid any mix ups. The oh so yummy sounding garlic bath is butter based, but they could just steam the seafood and I got garlic oil on the side.  The food for all of us came out in a reasonable time considering they were packed.  My seafood was cooked perfect, the clams here are hilariously tiny, but we're in AS and it is what it is. My husband had a platter as well and all of the food was cooked well, but fried food is exactly that.. All the while, our very active 5 year old has eaten her fill of penne pasta and mandarins and is back running a muck on the playground while we sit and enjoy our dinner.  The waitress, Wei, was very attentive and we never had an empty glass on the table, but she wasn't in our face every 5 min either, which was nice. The manager even popped back over to check on us a few times.  As a local, I would definitely recommend this location as a family friendly spot.  Thank you Wei for great service!!! Thank you Ms. Nice Woman FOHM",

I could make this at home for less than $5. 2) Waitress would not honor my free appetizer coupon. She said I couldn't use that and my birthday reward or welcome reward together. At the end of the meal, I asked the manager and she said the waitress was wrong. I lost out on a free appetizer. 3) Manager deducted my welcome reward from my bill instead of the birthday reward...so, I lost my birthday reward since it expires in a few days. She said she had no control over it.  I called customer support and they agreed with the manager that the welcome reward for $25 is applied first. This makes no sense since the birthday reward expires sooner. So, I actually gained nothing for the birthday reward. The customer support person said he could extend the birthday reward for 2 weeks...not worth it. I told him they need to change their system and allow customers to determine which reward they want applied. 4) Too many confusing and unfriendly policies and what rewards and coupons can be used together or not. 5) Never going back. Save your money and go somewhere else. The place is a dive and overpriced. 6) Food was \"eh\" at best....small portion sizes, cold temps. The dinner salad was the best part....pretty sad.

The icing on the cake was noticing that the guts of the shrimp had not been cleaned out prior to serving! I was absolutely disgusted, I purchased three meals and not a single one had been properly cleaned. I will never return to this establishment. The manager promised to take care of it but all she did was give us a military discount of 10%. The vibe in there is like this kind of thing happens on the regular basis I truly recommend you find another location.",

    "text": "Wow I can never catch a break. When greeted by the host she acted as if I was an inconvenience. It's Sunday night at 7:45 (not busy) she seats us. 8:10 i find a manager to let him know we still haven't even been greeted or acknowledged. Our server who saw us multiple times ignored us. Probably because it was the time she should be cut and the host sat her when she wanted no more tables. I get it but it's not our fault. We were super excited about trying this place for the first time. Manager had to take out order. Drinks still weren't served for another 5-7 minutes. BTW the manager didn't even discount our bill. We payed 80 for the worst service I've ever had. When the food was severed we had no plates or crab crackers NOTHING we waited another 10 to get that. Food was slightly warm by the time we received stuff. Just WOW!!! Learn customer service because it's awful. At least offer something, my server finally apologized at the end and blamed it on EXPO which had nothing to do with her. She had 2 other tables with food dropped. Total disappointment",

Shells were too soft to crack and meat was sticking to shells. If your signature entree is crab, it has to be prepared consistently and done well.  I don't mind paying for quality food but $120 for lackluster crab is like salt in a wound.  Probably not going back until reviews improve.",

    "text": "Well here it is... my bad review.  The service is the worst! I am basing this review on my last 3 visits, sadly there will not be a 4th. The food is okay, but when you order crab it's always a \"crap shoot\" Maybe you'll get a good bucket, maybe you wont. If you complain and turn your expensive dinner out into a negative thing, they will attempt to make it better.  My problem with that is that I don't like to complain, for these prices I expect somebody there to check it before it gets to me. That \"somebody\" is supposed to be the server. My server has never delivered the food. Never. They take the order, bring drinks and deliver the check, all done to slow.  After we are promptly seated, we are forgotten. 5 - 10 minutes before we are greeted and offered beverages. Appetizers come out only moments before the entrees, water glasses are left empty. I get that is is a casual dining experience and so the service should make it appear relaxed and fun while at the same time giving at a minimum 4 star service. Our check is usually between $100 - $ 150 That equals $ 20 - $ 30 tip !!! The last 3 visits in my opinion the server deserved $ 10 !!! For the sake of management, who may wonder about this terrible review, I will tell you these 3 visits occurred on weeknights  between 7:00 and 8:00. Why so late ? We drive 45 miles to get there!                                                 PEACE OUT, JOE'S CRAP SHACK",

I was too busy reading the drink menu, I actually told our waitress to take care of other tables and come back.   Southern sweet tea, rockin' poppin' something something, and gone fishin' as drinks. I don't like the fact that they don't list price on any of their drinks (I guess that's trend for every corporate restaurants...) They were all around $8.50 per drink. Drinks were pretty and yummy. But expensive for casual restaurant.   Calamari, Balls of fire, and stuffed mushrooms as a starter. Calamari was way too soft. I guess all you Americans like soft Calamari... my Asian taste buds ask for more chewy texture... Other \"balls\" were tasty.  Pots. We ordered the Orleans, Ragin' Cajun, and Diablo. Looked so much better on picture than the actual meal. I thought it was too salty. Crawfish was gross... Crabs were pretty good. Corn and potatoes tasted the best.   Overall, really expensive. Bill was $165 between 4 people. Food, meh. Service, pretty good. 3 stars.",

    "text": "I came here with the wife and was eventually joined by my sisters in law.   We were seated quickly, which is what I'd expect on a Monday night. We were greeted promptly and given our drinks which consisted of lemonade and iced tea.  We eventually ordered our meals. I had one of the combos which included a crab cake, fish and chips, stuffed shrimp, and onion strings. My wife ordered the queen crab pot with a garlic butter sauce.  First off, I'll start with the good - the crab legs were good. The crab cake seemed a bit overly salty, but was overall pretty good.   Now, for the rest. Service overall was very slow. When we decided to try a mixed drink it took 15 minutes before it arrived at the table. The meals, save for the crab legs, were generally over salted. The stuffed shrimp were.... interesting. They give you 4, 2 were plenty for me because I couldn't eat any more of them. The onion strings were good if you got the edges of them. The middle of them was soggy and seemed like they hadn't been in the fryer long enough. I don't know what the heck they did with the fish fillet, but the batter was salty, and the flavor was wrong. That's the only way to describe it. The fish itself definitely had the frozen-thawed sense about it. Definitely not fresh. The tartar sauce they gave me may as well have been mayonnaise. That's all it really was.  When the checks arrived the waitress disappeared and we waited another 15 minutes before we'd finally had enough and sought out the manager to take care of our bills.   I would like to give them another shot but I just can't feel it's worth the money to gamble for a sub par experience.",

We had reserved a big table for 14 people and they were able to accommodate us which was great. The reason for my 2 stars is because of the service. It took forever for us to order and get our drinks and food. I know that we had a big table but there were two staff members taking care of us. The waitress was great but the waiter was super slow and had forgotten about us our something because one of my fellow classmate and I had ordered some alcoholic beverages and it took him 20 minutes to check up on us and asked if we wanted anything else and I was like umm yeah...our drinks! I have to say my Bloody Mary was delicious though so my annoyance for the delay disappeared. The food was okay. I had ordered The Ragin' Cajun to share with my friend. It was a little bit too salty for me but squirting some lemon juice on top made it taste better. Overall Joe's Crab Shack was okay. I don't think I will be coming back. I'll get my seafood fix somewhere else.",

It included lobster, clams, corn and sausage - it was the perfect size to please us both for dinner and I think it was priced fairly. We enjoyed our meal and the staff occassionally broke out into song and dance which kept it lively and gave us a good chuckle too. It's not a fancy place by any means but so far one of the better places I've enjoyed for seafood here in AZ. Go in with a fun attitude and you'll enjoy yourself as much as we did.

I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, so I know that the best Crab is Dungeness, and you can't really find it just anywhere here in the Valley. But, at Joe's they've got it in abundance. Get a steam pot. Get crackin'. Get dirty. Get filled up. ...Then get outta there. That's my game plan. Oh, the Paella is good too.",

I loved it.  It may be sloppy and sometimes crab shells may pop you in the face, but the juiciness of the meat is so worth it.  The lobster was a bit on the overdone, rubbery side, but the crab was cooked to perfection as expected from a place that specializes in crab.  The potatoes were delicious and the corn was a bit on the over seasoned side.  Correction: only one side was seasoned, and seasoned heavily, while the other side was good.   Joe's is probably one of the most consistent chains out and one of the few I will return to.  The only reason I cringe at going back is the song and dance.  It can be a bit overabundant and take away from the dining experience.  The song and dance also distracts from good service.  It wasn't bad, just not good.",

We ordered steak, crab, shrimp...a wide selection of the menu and were stunned by how good everything was. This included our waitress \"Amy\" who was so bright and attentive my wife asked: \"Are you always this cheerful \"?   I am used to seafood in Arizona being overcooked, over seasoned \"or something\". This was not. Everything was great. The notable exception was the malt vinegar at our table ( which had turned). Hence four stars instead of five.   The portions were also impressive. They have made a fan for life.",

    "text": "I absolutely love Joes but not this location and here's why.  When our appetizer arrived I was excited just to eat. But I soon found the calamari was chewy and the crab dip was very bland and seemed to have an overwhelming mayo taste.  For my main dish I ordered a steam pot that was short of steamy. The food was room temp and the scallops in my pot were chewy (They also had little burnt bits of whatever pan they were prepared in.) My family member ordered the steak and asked for medium rare, there wasn't a streak of pink in his steak. He did enjoy his French fries though crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.  Though I appreciate the laid back atmosphere of Joes, the crew here seemed to take it to a new level. Many choosing to stand in groups talking to one another. Also the appearance of multiple staff members looked as if they just rolled out of bed. (Bed hair and all) And they had no energy at all! The little ones in my family were very disappointed that there wasn't dancing like the Macarena as seen in other locations. I work in customer service and energy is a big thing. If you show you excited to be at work then you customers will be excited with you. I really hope it was just a bum Friday night.   Usually my family and I come here on special occasions but I think we are going to look for other options now.",

    "text": "Last night we visited this place. First of all, let me start by saying that the wait staff and manager were great.  The food, was a totally different thing.     So they were having a special of $15 lobsters so we ordered a few. When they came out, I was surprised at how tiny they were. The meat from the tail was approximately 2-3 inches long and mushy. They were filled with water so all the meat was not only wet, but cold. The manager took them off the bill and asked if we wanted something else. We were still starving so I asked for some crab legs. He brought me out a side order which was one cluster. I told the waiter that wasn't enough so I ordered 2 more \"sides\" of crab legs. They were fine but not filling. The sides that accompanied the lobsters were boiled, unseasoned potatoes and an ear of plain corn. Flavorless. The hush puppies were meh. So the only person in my party of 3 who was full was my 10 year old who ordered the crab leg dinner. The bill still came to $70 so I don't think I'll be returning because it just wasn't worth the money. Outback Steakhouse has lobster tails for $10.99 and they are 3x the size of these. We get them often. Joes seems like a lot of work and dismantling for little reward. If you're looking to smell like fish and like cracking stuff this is the place, but you may still be hungry when you leave",

The manager Donny was out talking to guest as you would expect in a good service establishment. But more importantly the managers expectations oozed from his employees as they were cheerful, pleasant and engaging. just good wholesome people that seem to care and wanted to help, but yet not overbearing at my table every five seconds. just great all around service from the server to the greeter to the manager. With higher-quality food you get a little bit higher price so this isn't a place that I can afford to eat every day but it's definitely worth a try. And if you get creative with appetizers and sharing pots you can keep it affordable.",

The food, service, and cleanliness of this place is better, despite them being both part of the same seafood restaurant chain.  The seafood itself varies, as the queen crab was pretty tasty and sweet, but the lobster in my Arctic Bay steamer was pretty bland.  The shrimp that came with it were good since they were the ones that soaked up a lot of the Old Bay seasoning.  I also tried some of the crawfish platter, which was a delicious mix of crawfish etouffee and fried crawfish on top of white rice.",

Of course our King crab legs were icebox cold. Our waitress suggested they just cooled down however our other legs were still warm.  At the end while attempting to use our Digital wallet with Bank of America both Kim and the manager seemed absolutely clueless about the option. The manager had the nerve to yell across the room because in her mind we must've didn't deserve the attention the matter required.  Lastly, we finally attempted the transaction and Kim asked us how do we use the register?!?! So unbelievable. As a result I will say this service was very unprofessional, had the worst mannerism from our waitress and absolutely incompetent.",

So we waited a lot as in waited until we stared her down till she sees us. I'm not sure if I'm coming back. Eh I prefer Hot N Juicy Crawfish or Angry Crab Shack or the one in L.A. Boiling Crab  I'm sorry but I wasn't satisfied tonight at Joe's Crab Shack",

They even tried to charge us for every mess up they had to remake. Bill was almost 200 dollars before i called the server back over to ask why it was like that. Server messed up so badly, but she was still friendly and that's the Entire reason my entire table wasn't furious. The worst part of this was the manager coming over. The first thing she said was \"so my server said you were having trouble understanding your bill. \" I barely got two words out before she interrupted me to tell me why i was about to pay for their mess ups. I tried again when she paused and she just talked louder instead. That is NOT how a manager should act. I should have asked them to comp the Entire meal! Our drinks were spilled, almost destroying a phone on the table. Our food was barely warm when we got it, most of the time spent there was waiting for our correct food. (Which we never fully recieved, still had missing food, but we were starving.) We sat down at the table (after 20 minutes waiting for one) at 7:45.... we didn't leave until 10:50 and not because we were taking our time eating. We had even purchased the drinks that you get the cup after your meal and we never were given those. We still ended up paying out over 100 dollars too.. Things like this should Never Happen! I'll never eat at this location ever again.. learned my lesson.",

    "text": "It had been roughly 7 years since I had eaten at Joes and all experiences up to this one were good (Hindsight that may have been because of how naive I was at a young age). We walked in for lunch and it took around 5 minutes to be sat.... not a big deal for me because I've worked in restaurants before and know the struggle, but it gets rockier from here. Our waitress was pleasant, but mildly slow. When we arrived we were the first table in her section and it took about another 10 minutes to get our waters and another 10 minutes to actually order. Again, I'm not agitated in the least at this point, but I'm already starting to question this experience. I ordered a steamer and my guest ordered the grilled chicken. It took about 25 minutes to finally get our meal. This seemed odd as well since the entire place had about 4 other tables in the entire establishment. This, however, is when I become agitated. The lobster and shrimp were not cleaned properly. I was a Kitchen Manager and General Manager for a restaurant myself and was repulsed by this sight. I tried to clean them myself with the water provided from my beverage, but a thought finally crossed my mind that I'll be paying $35 to clean my own crustaceans? We didn't complain and we made sure to tip our waitress the 20% she had earned because it did seem she was working hard and was a bit overwhelmed. It obviously wasn't her fault that my meal wasn't cleaned properly.   One bright note: My guest chucked was quite good, although it was a tad over cooked. I'm guessing the fear of food poisoning had to do with that and for that we thank you!",

Food finally arrived. We were almost done with our meal when another server shows up with the same exact order claiming it was for our table. Apparently our original order was taken by someone else so a new order was placed. Such disappointing service! Except for an apology from our waitress there was nothing else done for us while the table next to us got part of their bill comped since they had a complaint. On our way out, my husband stopped to share our disappointment with the host, who appeared not to care and just stood there. When another hostess arrived and heard what was happening she offered to get the manager right away. When the manager arrived, she informed us that she was never informed about our dinner incident. Well, we paid by a gift card and did not want a free appetizer for our next visit since there will not be another visit. She offered free desserts-too little too late I say. I understand the poor reviews now. Such a disappointing experience! Won't be",

We brought it to the attention of our waitress, who brought the manager Adrienne over.  They both apologized profusely and took the charges off of our bill, which is what I would expect.  We were polite and appreciative of their apology and really didn't expect or ask for anything else.  However, they also offered to give us a credit to come back another time so they could prove to us that it was just a one time mistake.  We took them up on the offer, and sure enough the food was excellent the second time around.  Our server was fantastic, Adrienne came by to make sure we were happy, and the chef even came out to make sure we were pleased with the meal.

But the food was delicious. Some of the comments claimed the food was salty since I like salty food it was perfect. But in general it might be a little too salty for other people. Appetizer was yummy. We got a platter. My favorite was crab dip? I don't remember the name but it was sooo good! The steam pot was big. My boyfriend order some fish and shrimps the portion was huge for the price we even have leftover!   Manager made his round twice to check on the customers which was very nice. But our server which I don't know his name wasn't that great. Definetly going back there again for my seafood fix. Yummy and Messy crab juice!",

Service: I've been here at least 10 times now and the service has always been consistently great! Every single time I am here (literally...every single time), the manager of the day will always stops by at least once to say hi and to make sure that everything is great for the customers.   Food: I always order the queen crab bucket with garlic Herb flavor. Crab legs have a decent amount of crab meat in it, but my only complain is that I cannot taste the garlic flavor much in the meat itself. Other than that, their seafood is always fresh and I've always enjoyed coming here. All buckets also comes with corn and potatoes, but you can substitute them with other side dishes if you like.   Rating: I will definitely come back here again. I love the fact that they have a huge roll of napkins for you to use - which is important to me since it is a bit messy eating seafood with hands lol.",

    "text": "Why is it so hard to get good service?! I am extremely disappointed with the service I received from this place. I have been to this particular location several times and come here instead of the one on Southern because of the atmosphere overall but today was another story.  We made a reservation for our party of 6 and when we arrived we got seated right away, this was a plus. We got our drinks and appetizers ordered and everything seemed to be going well. Our waitress brought out appetizer plates and as they were being passed around the table we noticed there was still quite a bit of food on the plates. You know when you heat something up and cheese gets stuck to the plate and won't come off unless you scrub it, yes that kind of stuck. This leads me to believe that they don't scrub the plates that they use, gross. We showed the waitress and she said she would get us new plates when the appetizers came out. About 5 minutes later our appetizers came out but our waitress was no were to be found with the plates. We finally asked someone else for plates and they brought us great big dinner plates. Overall appetizers were excellent. We ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms and the seasoned bucket of shrimp, beware seasoned shrimp is super spicy.   It took another 10-15 minutes for our food. I had the Redfish and lobster which was really good. It has a little bit of kick to it on the spice but the sauce they use it prepare over the fish is phenomenal. Another person in my party ordered BBQ snow crab and the bucket they gave him only had 1 claw instead of the normal 2-3 that the usually give. Surprisingly the manager noticed this when they brought the food and asked us if it had come out like that. When we told him yes, he said he would send more food out and we could continue to eat what we had already been given. Some random brought the missing food out which I personally thought should have been a manger. He never came back out to check to see if the order was corrected or to make sure everything was right. Another person in my party also ordered the BBQ snow crab but when he got his food it wasn't BBQ flavor it was something different. When I told the waitress she went back and checked the ticket and figured out that she entered it incorrectly. She apologized and asked if there was something else we wanted. At this point i just wanted to leave. A manager never came over and this was the 3rd mistake they made for our table. It was almost time to leave and we got a drink refill it was supposed to be a Diet Coke and she brought a regular Coke. Mistake #4 and still no manager.    Food was good but service was horrible. Unfortunately, your good food does not take precedence over good service. I can go somewhere else and get both. I work too hard for my money and I'm not going to give it to someone who isn't going to work hard to get me to come back.",

    "text": "The two-star review is the average between my husband's experience and mine.  I grew up in Florida, so I have known about Joe's for a while.  I had gone there several times and had always found their food to be great and of good quality.  However, it's been more than 10 years since my last visit.  My husband had never even heard of them, let alone dined there.  We decided to go there a week ago.  For me, when I walked in, it was just like old times.  The smell of seafood wafting through the air, the spacious tables, the busy waitstaff all took me back to Florida.  Customers seemed pleased being there.  Yet the first experience was with the host.  She seemed utterly bored with her job, because she didn't smile or seem welcoming.  She boringly asked us if we wanted to dine inside or out and got our menus and directed us according to our response, which was inside.  After having been seated, our waiter came to the table.  He was nice-looking, which isn't shocking, since they want them to be tipped well, but he was the most disinterested waiter I had had in a long time.  He dryly asked us what we wanted to drink, didn't offer suggestions, and didn't bother to ask if we had been there before.  This was a purely transactional relationship to him.  I'm tolerant of disaffected waitstaff, but my husband isn't in the least.  The bright side is he brought out our drinks correctly.  We then ordered our food through him, and, again, he was disengaged and appeared to have his mind on something else.  And this is where the problems came about.  Fifteen minutes later, my food had arrived but not my husband's.  My husband told me to go ahead and eat, since we thought his food would arrive shortly thereafter.  Twenty minutes after that (and of me snacking on my food in an attempt to wait), his food still had not arrived.  The waiter hadn't stopped by or didn't proactively try to determine what the issue was.  We had to flag down one of the managers to find out what was happening.  Apparently, the staff in the back either forgot about the meal or had some issue with the oven.  My husband's an easygoing fellow, but where he will let his feelings be known unequivocally is in restaurants when he feels he receives poor service.  He certainly shared his feelings with the manager in no uncertain terms.  However, the manager's responses were great.  He smiled and said that he didn't want us to be made (I wasn't) and started rubbing my husband on the arm (in a consoling fashion) and making a few jokes to get us to laugh, and it worked for me.  For my husband, not so much.  I thought it was a great way to recover our service, but my husband's a tough one to placate after you have irritated him.  Regardless, the food came out five minutes later.  It was freshly cooked and looked great.  And despite my husband's protestations and hell-bent expectation of not liking the food, he admitted (when we got home) that the food was good.  From my perspective, I would have given them three stars, which includes a rating on the quality of the food and the service recovery by the manager.  My husband would have given it one star because of the entire experience.  The average is two stars.  Would I return?  Sure.  But it's clear that I'll be going without my husband in the future.  He's been forever turned off the place, which is understandable, considering this was his first-ever experience.",

The employees dance for an occasional song (about every 30 mins or so) to encourage more of a fun festive atmosphere for customers. Some may not like the music, but I liked it and most people enjoy it! Seafood in general is usually kinda high priced anywhere, but Joe's is no more expensive than the next place.",

    "text": "This location has gone very downhill.  This evening I was out with one other person. Hanna was our server, she took our drink orders, where I asked for a tea with no lemon. When I was brought the tea, it had lemon and in promptly removed it and put it in the bucket so it didn't get too lemony. She didn't apologize for bringing it with lemon.  We ordered an appetizer of clam strips. We later also ordered our main meal of a crab cake sandwich with a cup of chowder and fish and chips.  I asked to have ranch for the appetizer when it came out. I waited for some time - long enough to realize I hadn't seen her in a while. I was waiting then for anyone to come by so I could get ranch before the appetizer got cold. Finally, she came to bring the chowder and I asked about it and she said sorry and went to grab it for me.   Next, when the crab cake sandwich and fish and chips were brought, I realized I was brought the crab cake DINNER and not the SANDWICH. Which was very odd considering I pointed to it when ordering, she took the time to lean in and read it, and I had asked for it with fries which would have been weird if I'd ordered the dinner as the dinner came with fries by default and didn't have an option for another side. I mentioned this to her and said that I didn't want the 2 crab cake dinner for $19.49, I wanted the one under Handhelds on the menu for $12.29. She said it was no problem that she could just comp it or she could take it back. I stressed that I just wanted the cheaper one but if they wanted to comp me I'd just keep it so I didn't have to wait for them to make me new food. She asked if I wanted a bun like the sandwich would have had and I said no it's fine. So I started to eat. My friend asked for ketchup and I asked for a refill on tea before she left.  She came back not too long later with a glove and said her manager told her she could comp it if she took away my other crab cake, since the sandwich would have only come with one. I was kind of in shock. I was like hey, fine whatever - I'll only be paying for the sandwich portion anyway - but it just kind of seemed petty. Like they were treating me like a thief trying to get more and pay less. None of it would have happened if not for the bad service in the first place - I was very clear in my order. So she scraped one of my crab cakes away and left. We didn't see her for quite a while again. No ketchup or tea was brought from when we asked the time before.  She was mildly apologetic about things, but I didn't sense any sincerity. Almost every time we asked for something, we had to ask again, then the order was wrong, then the take back of the additional food - it was just a mess and really felt like we were being treated badly.  The worst part, when we got the bill (and this was our mistake) we didn't check before handing our card. We should have. The $19.49 crab cake dinner that I didn't order and was promised to be comped to the sandwich price of $12.29 was not. The dinner was charged full price and they did a comp of $4.00. We were trying to just get out, and should have looked to make sure it was right first. But no - they had the nerve to do all that bad service and treat us poorly, THEN charge us that way? Maybe if I kept the second crab cake it would have been justified, but that was just obnoxious.   The food was generally good for what it's worth, but the drinks (tea and soda) were not great tasting. Also the bathrooms were absolutely horrifying. We couldn't bring ourselves to use them.  We used to come here a lot - driving out of our way to go - but I don't know if we'll be back.",

There were 11 of us, 3 of which were kids, so I made a reservation to make sure our larger party was not a surprise to them. We were sat in a timely manner. Skip ahead to when the food arrived. All of the food arrived except mine, my dads, and my grandmas, we waited almost 10 min before the waitress came out to tell us our three meals had been taken to the wrong table and they were making new ones for us. Again we waited,25 minutes later our food arrived, by this time everyone but the three of us were done eating. Mine came out cold after all of that. The manager was the one that brought them out so she was aware of the situation. The waitress did not make another appearance until we were then done eating. She didnt even offer for us to order dessert, which the kids meals came with and dropped off the checks. Not one penny was removed for everything that had gone wrong. I asked to speak with the manager and told her everything that had happened and she appoligized. She said since we had already paid the bill ($250 plus tip) she could give me 2 coupons for free appetizers our our next visit. I declined because i do not see us visiting again. The only redeeming factor was they had a play place for the kids. Poor service, bad managment.",

They gave us a more family friendly area and we were able to hear each other and feel like we were hanging out. It's still pretty pricey but seafood brought from the coast is. Most had the build your own steam pot and that saved a few bucks. Playground is great for kiddos too. We'll be back.",

If I had skin or acne like that I would at least adopt a great attitude. Double eww! The whole staff was totally inhospitable and cold including the insincere gm who never came by any of the tables. I felt like we were at Dick's, or on an episode of punk'd, hah! Not how I wanted to be treated with my mom on her Birthday. That's what we get for trying to find seafood this far from the ocean. Can't wait to take a trip back to California where we can get some \"REAL\" Joe's, yeah baby!! We left probably before the cook even got our main course order. I shouldn't have even had to pay, but the $15 bucks (total for a 1/2 lb order of peel n eat shrimp, which were great, and a cup of clam chowder which in and of itself was a whole other joke) was worth it to know not to EVER step foot inside the tired assed Tempe location ever again, hah! But you all enjoy! ;)  BTW that 1 gold star is for the shrimp.",

I'm a critic and I have high expectations of restaurants in terms of food quality, efficiency, and service, and I am giving Joe's Crab Shack a 5 star rating. Not only was my waitress very kind and helpful but she worked well with the rest of team. Normally at restaurants you will see one waitress attending to your table and other waitresses pass by without a word or smile, but here, everyone works as one team. Waiters, kitchen staff, and waitresses worked like one machine with a human element. Wish other restaurants had this type of service. Great job Joe's Crab Shack!! I will be coming back soon!",

There was just four of us. It took 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge our table then we ordered. We watched our drinks sit at bar for 20 minutes while all the staff sang for 3 different birthday parties. My husband finally went and got the drinks off the bar. Out appetizer took over 35 minutes and dinner over an hour and 15 minutes. We were there over two hours.  Water was never refilled even when we asked. Dirty dishes were not once taken away although a tray of dirty dishes from another table sat right next to our table for over a half hour blocking the isle. We asked for our bill and it took 20 minutes to get out credit card back. I could go on and on! It was almost comical!   All this shitty service and the food was less than mediocre! This place needs new management big time!",

Not the time to be housekeeping in the middle of dinner kitchen rush.  The food was really mediocre. I know, it's mostly fried seafood and yes, it can be done even decently well, this was not however. It tasted of old oil and dripped of it to... A disgusting mess, all around.  For what we paid and what appeared on our plates, it was a joke to even imagine we'd come back again. No way.  I'll give it two stars because the staff was over nice and welcoming and the balloon guy made my kids really neat balloon figures. That's it.",

We waited over an hour from the time we ordered our food, to the time we finally received it.  My order of the Steamer, steam pot was terrible. It tasted over cooked (like leftovers) and had zero flavor and was cool. A $22 meal should NOT taste like this!  I was so disappointed.  My boyfriend's food was brought out but a portion forgotten. His food tasted good and was warm.  Sonia did have my dish removed from our bill, because I didn't eat much of it but not once did the manager come over to speak to us as she was too busy pouring her sugary customer service into one table, who also was unsatisfied with things.

This last time we went just a couple days after New Years we didn't get the best service. We sat in a booth right next to the front. It took over 10 minutes for someone to even greet us. They took our drink order and got my sons food in first. After that it took our waitress over 20 minutes to come back with our waters that we ordered. She took our orders. My sons Mac and cheese came out shortly after she took our order. It was dry and crusty like it had been sitting there awhile before being brought out to us. Again we're waiting for the waitress, she's no where to be seen. Another while has passed and we get our food from another server. We told him about the Mac and cheese and he brought us a new fresh one. He also refilled our drinks, brought ranch, butter and ketchup. Told him how ridiculous our service was from our server. Come to find out our server was the bartender too. I have no idea why because they were not busy at all, we were confused why the bartender was our server and we were not even sitting in the bar area.  Manger must of been notified because she Took the kids meal and a side off of our bill. Again we waited another 20-30 minutes just for our bill. Beth didn't come over once to refill our drinks, check to see how we're doing, check on our food etc. Her service was ridiculous. We ended up not leaving her a tip. The only thing she did was take our order. We did leave the guy that was helping us some cash. He was wonderful but I didn't catch his name. We spent over two hours in a restaurant that we should of been in and out of because it wasn't busy at all.   My boyfriend left his sunglasses on the table and realized half way after our drive home. We called and the gal who answered the phone said she didn't see them and would ask. We turned around and went back. When we went inside the hostess told him that they looked. We asked for a manager. The manager also said that she looked and didn't see them and no servers had them. My boyfriend then stated he was going to go over and talk to her and ask him his self. The Manager then stated that she can't have him do that in front of customers. My boyfriend said then you need to go find my sunglasses or we will be calling the police. She says to let her go over and check again. She pullled the bartender (Beth) into the back and not even 1 minute later she comes out with my boyfriends sunglasses. We grabbed them, thanked her and left.  After terrible service and then the whole sunglasses thing we will not be returning to JOE'S crab shack. We've never had such horrible customer service from our server. Other then that the food is good.",

    "text": "Nope nope nope... Only reason I'm even giving this place 2 stars is because our server Jackie was the only good thing about this place. The food was flavorless and any flavor there was, was a sea salt water taste. The smell itself was an indication that the food was not fresh. Frozen and old at best. Really tried and hope to like this place on the simple fact that Jackie sold this place so well and was an amazing server. Drinks bought there were ok but the two  servers that brought them were spilling while walking and they weren't even that full. And immediately left before we could ask them for straws. The kids meal was decent. But honestly if the best thing on our table was the chicken at a seafood place...  DO NOT GO/RETURN!!!!  Worst $140.00 ever spent!!!!",

Bar staff was great helping me move and even served my friends before the waitress who was to serve us came around.  I have to say the food was decent and tasty.  I had the seafood sampler - Crab dip, fire balls and calamari.   All three warm and tasty.  My only sad thing is moving to the table.  This young waitress needs to find another job.  She not only was having a bad day, which everyone can have.  But she had t with an attitude of she was in the right at all times.  Even when the bar tender came and helped out.   So sad.  Wish I had never moved.  The service was horrid with this young lady.",

    "text": "If I could request Stephen every time I come here, I definitely would. Amazing service. Dude was completely on top of it all night on what looked to be a super busy Friday night. On top of that, we had a party of 7 and he made sure everything was perfect for each member of our group. I'm not a fan of crab, so I had the shrimp sampler. I expected like 3 coconut, 3 crispy and a small handful of popcorn. Nope. Shrimp for days. I usually don't make it a point to count my food, but I did this time because it surprised me a bit. 6 of each with a good size of the plate being conquered by the popcorn shrimp. I finally understood the plight of the Three-six Mafia when they said, \"I eat so many shrimps I got iodine poisoning.\" I'm not a skinny kid by any means, I like to throw down on some food, and this plate had me down to the last two shrimp. I had to make the conscious effort to not let this plate beat me. My wife looked at me and it had an Adrian and Rocky feel to it. As I finished the second to last shrimp, I could hear her cheering me on in my head, \"You're doing it! You're gonna do it!\" It was just me and this final shrimp now. No way was I going to let it beat me. I'd eaten his family, now I had to eat him. No way was I going to let this shrimp come back and get revenge on me or my family in the days to come. I made it a point to look it right where it's eyes should've been , ripped off the tail and popped the whole thing in my mouth. (Warning: the next part is very graphic, so if you have a weak stomach, please stop here) I chewed on this shrimp until his body was only mush rolling around in my mouth. All I needed to do was swallow and the task would be complete. I was stuck. My own body betrayed me. It's as if my body had somehow made a pact with the shrimp to double cross me at the final moment. Sitting there in a room full of people, with a mouthful of chewed up shrimp that I couldn't swallow. I was too full. My own body. I couldn't believe it, I know we had our disagreements, like when I forced it to run or do exercise, but I never thought it would betray me like this. I sat there with a sense of determination, I was not going to spit this shrimp out into a napkin. Not today. I reached for my sprite and my stomach churned, almost to try and tell me it knew what I was about to do. I smiled, for I knew that victory was within reach. I took a swig of that clear, bubbly sweet liquid and as it came into contact with the chewed up remains of my fallen foe, it created a slurry that confused my body and made it past the doorman. The mix of shrimp and sprite started to go down and I knew the battle was over. I had beat the shrimp. I raised my arms in victory and my wife snapped me back to reality. \"What are you doing?!\" She was completely unaware of the grudge match that had just taken place before her very eyes. \"Nothing, just stretching,\" I replied. I could never let her know how closely she had come to catastrophe. For her own safety, I took a secondary swallow of sprite to clear any remnants and sat back in my chair, ready to once again join the conversation with my friends and family who will never truly know the devastation they came so close to that night. (Note: this started out as just a positive review that went sideways on me. I had an awesome night here with great food and  service, and I hope my narrative doesn't detract from that overall message. This place is great. If you're on the fence about going there, just give it a shot. If you end up with Stephen [possibly Steven, I'm not 100 percent sure of the spelling] he will make sure your night goes as well as mine.)",

I have seen the commercials and decided to try the place out.  1st thing that I noticed was that every plate is 1/2 full with fries and/or fried onions.  I love fries and fried onions but when I'm paying around $17-20+ a plate the fries had better come on an extra plate.  I felt like the food was mediocre for the expensive price.  I decided to return again and ordered the crab cakes, big mistake.  The things smelled and tasted rancid, and I'm not using that term figuratively.  They exchanged them for some fired shrimp but the damage had been done.  Again the prices were way too much for below par food and the amount of plate filler is unacceptable.  To top it off both times I was there the place seems to have staff, mainly teenagers, standing around chatting but no one is doing any work.  Bad food, high prices and poor service pretty much sums up this gem.  If you're in the mood for seafood I would strongly recommend against this place.",

This Joe's is in Arizona, folks. And it's not bad.  We've been there several times. Are there better seafood restaurants out there? You bet. But I think this place has a decent bang for the buck.  The service has been at least adequate if not outstanding every time we've visited. I'm not crazy about the line-dancing routine that always happens, but the staff are good about refilling drinks, menu knowledge and experience.   The cooks are decent at preparing seafood, making sure it's not too tough or underdone. Usually, though, it's on the side of overdone that keeps me from giving more than 3 stars.  If you're expecting a lobster place in Maine, go to Maine. If you need a seafood fix at a somewhat reasonable price....here you go.",

We had dinner as a party of 6 on the patio, as has been our yearly tradition when friends come down for baseball spring training. (Not coming here next year, that's for sure!) Our waitress, who was obviously overloaded with tables, did her best but she was not as attentive as we would expect. The worst part, though, was how bad the food was. My Dungeness crab was tasteless, the potatoes tasted like they were cooked yesterday, and the corn on the cob was tough and tasted like field corn, not sweet corn. My husband ordered the Wednesday special of all you can eat shrimp and it, too, was awful. The coconut shrimp, sadly, was the worst. It was tasteless and soggy/soft in the middle - scary what's up with that and we're hoping he doesn't get sick tonight. Given how much food was left on our companions' plates, we suspect their meals were just as bad but it wasn't discussed, probably for fear of putting a damper on the evening. Don't waste your money eating here.",

It is very messy and drizzled in butter.  Don't wear any good clothes or risk having butter splotches all over.  The food itself is just ok.  Nothing to write home about.    The on-tap beer selection is less than desired.  If you like mass produced beers then you are in luck.

The steamed King Crab was fabulous as was the service. Wish I could remember out waiters name, but he was attentive without being pushy and had a great sense of humor. Our dinner was so good. I truly had not expected the crab to be so fresh and succulent. I will make sure to stop here again when I'm in town.",

    "text": "We went to Joe's yesterday to take my parents out for lunch. We are regulars and normally have a lovely time. However, this time there were some serious issues. All my elderly parents ordered was a bowl of soup each. The soup came out the FIRST time cold--ok, that is understandable. However, when this was explained to the waitress, Eryn, she was incredulous. It seemed to be beyond her grasp this was a possibility, and we must be witches with some sort of power over the space-time continuum because \"there is no way the soup could have gotten cold. It just came from the kitchen.\" After some discussion about the unbelievability of the situation, she agreed to get them new soup.   When she came back for round two (\"Ok, this time I saw it poured, and it was steaming!\"), once again, the soup was cold. This time I had a taste, and sure enough, it was tepid at best. Eryn was once again astounded, but gave the impression that we were beginning to annoy her with our requests for food served a the proper temperature. By the third try, they finally got it right. While the rest of us had almost finished our meal, their soup came out, and it was hot.  I understand that servers don't have a lot of control over what happens in the kitchen, and I am sure that Eryn was just having a busy lunch rush and didn't mean to appear skeptical and annoyed. However, there was NO visit from the manager to apologize for the problems, and both soups were on the bill. To sum up, it took them three tries to get a bowl of soup right, so my elderly parents had to sit there and watch the rest of us eat for most of the meal, AND they charged me for this experience. Really? No visit from the manager?!?!  I won't be returning to Joe's Crab Shack.",

    "text": "This is a tough review to write because we've been dining at this location for over 8 years and it has always been consistently inconsistent.  For example, I like to order the fish and chips. Years ago, Joe's used a fish called 'Hoki' to make their fish and chips. You would receive three fairly generous-sized portions of fish. I had never heard of Hoki before, but combined with the batter mixture they use, it was a great flavor I couldn't get anywhere else.  A couple years later, they replaced Hoki with Cod and the portions became smaller, so I stopped dining there as often. When I finally went back recently, they've once again replaced the fish in the fish and chips. Instead of Cod, now it's Pollock and the portions were generous again (still three pieces.)  Over the years we've had bad service, but good food. We've also experienced great service with bad food. And we've had bad service with bad food and good service with good food.   I'm guessing this is because there is such a high employee turn over rate. I've met no less than 4 managers of this particular location over the years, and none of them are still there.  The restaurant used to have all these cool decorations adorning the walls and ceiling and a disco ball and lights that would come on when the restaurant got busy. The reason for that was to get all the wait-staff to dance and distract the customers while the kitchen could get caught up during the break. I thought this was a brilliant idea.  Unfortunately, someone decided that was out-dated and they have completely (and, in my opinion, unnecessarily) renovated the inside and removed all the cool decor, and even the large shark that used to hang from the ceiling. What a shame. Now its just bland on the inside. Nothing special. I wish restaurants would focus more on the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the restaurant. I don't go to a restaurant for the decor and I don't go to a museum for the food.  All that said, I'm happy to report that on my most recent visit, the food was delicious and the service was excellent. However, I was a bit worried that my order was forgotten. Typically a salad comes out right  away.  They ended up bringing the salad out at the same time as everything else. I have no idea why they did that, but it's the only complaint I have for an otherwise perfect dining experience.   I did like the Pollock much more than the Cod, but I sure wish they'd bring back the Hoki. That's what made them unique. Fish and chips is often made with Cod, Pollock, Haddock, or even Halibut. I've never even heard of Hoki before. What a shame they choose to be like everyone else when what they had was so unique and delicious and couldn't be found at any other restaurant that I've ever been to in the Phoenix area.  I was initially going to make this a 3-star review, but everything was done so well on my most recent visit, I've bumped them up a star. Now, if they could just be more consistent with the menu, the food quality and the service...",

    "text": "Joe's is one more \"crab shack\" my husband and I decided to try last night. After seeing pictures posted on FB by a family member, we decided to add it on our Yelp bookmark list to try it when we're in the area. Yesterday and after shopping at Arizona Mills, we decided to give it shot.  The first thing you notice when you walk in is the size of the restaurant. It's pretty big compared to all the other seafood restaurants we have tried so far around town. Also, you will notice the clothing and souvenirs that are close to the entrance.   We were seated immediately. Restaurant was pretty full. I had not checked the menu before we went there; an unusual thing for me to do but my expectation was that I was going to find the same menu layout I have found at all the other \"crab shacks\" in town. That was not the case however. The menu was more like a regular franchise restaurant. I immediately looked for our \"usual\" and I was honestly surprised when I saw the price! For a pound of \"peel yourself shrimps\" you would pay $19.99! Wow! That's pretty pricey in comparison to the other places. Normally we're at the $13.99 range! So we kept browsing the menu and our waitress then came and introduced herself and asked if we had any questions. We discussed some menu options with her and based on her recommendation, we got a pound of shrimp with their signature seasoning and we added garlic to that. We also ordered an add on of king crab (I am not a big crab fan because of the hassle of eating it), and we ordered a side of corn and potatoes which is basically 2 red potatoes cut in half and a full corn ear. We were very hungry and our waitress said that our order should be enough.   The food came out and I was somewhat shocked again at the amount of food. The add on crab was 2 legs of crab! The shrimps were pretty small in comparison to other places. The potatoes were also relatively small but ok. When our waitress came to check on us just before we started eating and she asked if the amount of food was enough, we said, ummm maybe! So we ordered an appetizer of garlic bread to make sure the food will actually be enough at the end.   The flavor is there, the food was actually pretty good. Due to the size of the crab legs, there were easier to crack open and eat but they were exactly 3 bites of crab meat.   We moved to the shrimps. They were tasty but like I said earlier, pretty small. They were served with a cold red cocktail sauce on the side which was nice. The garlic bread came out and they were there big pieces of bread with a warmed marinara dip. They were honestly delicious.   By the time we finished all our food, we were feeling pretty good but not super full. We ordered only water as our drinks so no charge there. Our bill came out at $48 without tip. Considering the amount of food we got, that was pretty pricey. For the taste however, this was fine.   Overall, great service, good food but small portion in comparison to the price.",

Our server had a very strong \"don't get the crab cakes\" suggestion to go along with very weak positive recommendations for the coconut shrimp and shrimp etouffee.   Ordering both the coconut shrimp and the etouffee it became quickly apparent for the weak recommendations. The first had no coconut flavor at all. The server described the etouffee as a \"shrimp and lobster\" sauce. It did have a good cajun kick to it and the shrimp were plump and flavorful.  Pass on the s'mores dessert. The chocolate cake is frozen and then microwaved. Not worth $8.  This place was tired and worn out and so were all the staff in evidence.  Skip it. For the price, there are better options.",

Lots of fishermen decor. The hostess brought me back to the awaiting party & our waiter came over & took our drink order right away. I asked about the popular entrees & he recommended the steam pots. I ordered the Cajun Steampot and an order of Fish & Chips. It was about 30 mins before we received our entrees. The Fish & Chips was very good. The fish had a nice light batter, but I wished the batter was crispier. The fries were nothing special, just regular French fries. The seafood in the Cajun Steampot was fresh & very flavorful with the Cajun seasoning. Both entrees were big enough to share between two people. The employees also sung happy birthday to the birthday boy & that was fun. The downside are the prices are expensive. The Steampot was around $40 & the bill for 8 people was over $300.",

Another pleasant surprise, all of the food was also delicious, soooo fast and extremely fresh even right before close.  Waiter suggested some drink options and continued to check on us frequently all in all this was exactly what we needed after two full days of travel and repeat fast food meals! Hit the spot! Got the shrimp tacos and they are HUGE! Delicious nonetheless. My sister got a chicken sandwich and fries, she loved it. My mother ordered the fish and shrimp platter and omg it was good! Definitely recommend, music is a lil funky but it adds to the feel of the restaurant! 10/10!",

The wait time was about 25 minutes so that gave us time to look over the menu prior to being seated. We placed our order with the server who was very friendly however our food was brought out by another employee and it was cold as if it had been sitting out for a while before being ran to us. When it came time for the bill she was no where to be found. At this time the dinner rush had slowed down quite a bit however we still waited 20 minutes for her to bring the bill even after asking several other employees if they could track her down for us. When she finally showed up we paid in cash right away. Literally another 15 minutes went by before she brought back the change to the table and when she did it was $5 short lol..  In all the food was ok but the service was horrible.",

The place is very large and I didn't notice anyone waiting around which is a good thing.  My friend and I had the crab buckets. There is a ton of crab in those buckets! The only ding I give is because if you don't want corn on the cob or potatoes - you can only get double of the other. For the amount they charge for the buckets, maybe a small substitution should be allowed.  The food came out hot and delicious. The waitress was a bit over zealous checking in on us every 5 minutes, but hey, better to have her come by more often than not.  It's been quite some time since I visited Joe's, but I would definitely visit again!",

Did frequent, but not pesty, check-ins.   Their \"fun dance\" time is a nice touch and I assume it's one of their trademarks. But. I do have misophonia (certain pitches and tones are painful and irritating to me), so this was triggered during a few of their interactive dance sessions. Just please turn the volume down and add more bass/less treble? For the love of God. Because I was triggered, I shoved even more fried goodness dipped in tartar sauce. It did work.   Although it's not Pacific NW seafood quality (due to geographical location), it is decent in Sonoran desert.",

Today was the day.  We arrived and waited for the other members of our party to arrive. We were at this time informed 1 appetizer per 4 people. The waiter came over and introduced himself and proceeded to take drink orders. This is where things start to go bad.  First of all it was happy hour, but only in the bar. The waiter states you can not order in the bar and then take drinks to your table..  what gives!!!  One of our party members went to management and then they agreed to give happy hour drink pricing. Now it is time for the appetizers, there were 3 total. They  were brought to our table of 12, and with NO plates to share. The nachos were soggy before we got plates. Now we all ordered meals. This was fairly painless. They all arrived within each other so we all ate together.  One member had the all you can eat crab. Took over 30 min to get a one crab leg refill. The other 10 party members had already left. The drink refills were few and far between, the service was SUBPAR at best. When it was time to leave my husband went to management to critic the nights performance. I am pleased to say management agreed with this assessment and comped our next meal. I was soo utterly disappointed!!! If they do not improve soon, this location may lose business and have to close their doors like the  other tempe location. .",

    "text": "First off Elizabeth and Steven were great bartenders. I ordered the Crab Dip appetizer and the East Coast Platter entree (crab cake, southern stuffed shrimp, fish and chips, and onion strings, with Tabasco pepper butter sauce on the side). Overall i was dissappointed in the food but the bartenders brought it up to 3 stars. Crab dip was pretty darn good but after half a boat of dip I started to notice it was pretty salty. For the Entree  the fries were limp and soggy with grease and only lukewarm. The fried onions were pretty bland but crispy. The crab cake had an initial hint of lemon but was so overpowered with pepper, that I couldn't taste any crab.....that's how peppery it was. The crab cake finally had a decent crab flavor when i got to the middle of it. The stuffed shrimp was flavorful at first but the spiciness was completely overpowering after a few seconds. I would have chalked one up to being \"southern\" but then the bacon was cooked on top but raw on bottom. Dissappointing. Description says served with Tabasco sauce and the sauces were on side. No warning that the dish would be so spicy without sauce......time to take omeprazole. Fish was OK nothing bad but nothing to rave about. The tartar sauce was sweet (like it was made with sweet pickles because I tasted no dill) with too much mayo (never had sweet tartar before.......maybe it's a southern thing). Bathroom was clean but smelled like sewage........not the best smell after ingesting seafood but I'm lucky I have an iron gut. Maybe one more chance but it's iffy.",

Service (5/5): My face is an open book and the manager noticed I wasn't so thrilled with my food. I was shy about telling him what was wrong but he made it clear that it was totally fine to ask them to take back and redo the food. He also noticed that we didn't have a bag for our leftovers and made sure we left with one. He was very friendly and for service alone I'd recommend coming here.  Food (4/5): As I said earlier, I wasn't ecstatic about my food-- I ordered the crab cake dinner with broccoli and fries. I sent back the fries because they were too salty. But other than that, the fries were the right amount of crispiness. The crab cakes were not what I was used to but taste was average. They don't skimp out on the crab. You can tell in the picture the lumps of crab sticking out.",

We got seated at 3:21pm at 4:30 I went up to the manager who ignored me because he was busy putting out a fire at another table. I expected him to come back but after another 10 minutes I realized he wasn't going to. So I got up again and gave the hostess a try. She acted very concerned had me point out the table and said she would make sure our appetizer would be on it's way. The waiter Alex must have gotten lost or just avoiding our table because we rarely saw him. Others seem to be getting food around us finally the appetizer came by a runner at 4:45. If we had not bought our own drinks from the bar I am not sure we would have got one! Another 20 minutes passed and I went up to the hostess telling her we were this close to walking out she assured me the food was coming. 10 minutes later we walked out  informing the hostess  that we were leaving she did not seem to care. We got in the car but I just could not leave it at that. I went back in found the manager again and asked him for an apology for blowing me off and running mother's day he was very apologetic and begged me to come back in and that our food was ready so I went back to the car but I couldn't get  my family to go back in so I went back to tell him that they didn't want to anymore and not to bring the food out. He asked if he could make it up to me I said you could give me gift card if he really felt bad. He asked we to wait he came back 5 minutes later  with a couple of free appetizer cards with the purchase of an entree....please nice gift card I dropped them in the parking lot on the way out!!!! Now I will say it was mother's day and the were very busy but to wait that long is inexcusable.",

This is kind of a mash up 3 visit review. First visit was A Okay - saved draft was... Ariana is a fantastic bartender! She is sweet, attentive and super friendly! Great attitude! I had the bucket of labor intensive crab legs and she suggested getting the queen crab legs next time.  2nd visit - on the way home from the airport. Super tired, super hungry. I ordered the pasta Alfredo something-or-other which was NOT awesome but our server was fantastic! Missed her name but she's a super cute little blond whose husband also works there.  Tonight! Dom helped us and was great! I just can't get into their food. I really, really try because my husband likes seafood but I just can't do it. I ordered the basic salad with chicken and the chicken was dried out, beat up and kicked in the face. Completely inedible. I was impressed that the manager actually came to the table, apologized and asked me if I wanted anything else. He was awesome hence the 3 stars. I just really wish the food matched the service here. Hopefully my last visit.",

Ordered the steam pot and shrimp Apps and something from the kids menu. My party and I were playing a head up. Then after playing a few rounds I noticed the food was taking a while. Luckily I texted one of my friends a few minutes after I ordered. So I could see how long it was taking. It was 40 minutes. The food came out room temperature. Not what you want when one plate is $32.00. Long story short manger came out and said what do you want me to do. Very unprofessional. You are manger, you should know what to do. They gave us 10 dollars off but one of the plates should of been free. For the wait and temp. Will not be back..",

I haven't gone in quite some time but on my last visit I realized they revamped the menu. Still many of their great dishes are on the new menu. Including all of their famous buckets. The buckets can get pretty messy which is why they give you a large roll of paper towels and a \"bib\".   I tried the peach colada and my was that refreshing. A nice spin on the pina colada but with peach flavor.   For my entree I had a shrimp po boy. I couldn't believe how much shrimp they put on the sub. I couldn't even finish it all!   Still the same great joes I know and love. If you are a first timer be sure to try the great balls of fire as an appetizer!",

I'm not much of a seafood eater so I ordered pasta alfredo with chicken and Emma had the \"Captain's Plate\". My chicken was over cooked and dry and the pasta was way to salty.  Emma's deep fried shrimp was left way too long in the deep fryer and her crab like my pasta was way too salty. Why do cooks think they have to salt food to death to make it taste good. Seafood lives in the sea, it's already salty plus there are salt dispensers on the tables for those who have the need to hide the taste of the food their eating.  I would have given them a lower rating if it wasn't for the excellent wait service we received. It doesn't appear I'll be going back a second time",

She sure didn't know her menu. I asked \"specifically\" if the fish has a WET batter AND pointed to the picture of the fish on the menu, I was told yes. And yes, there is a picture of plate which clearly displayed a piece of BATTERED fish. And what came out was fish in  DRY cornmeal overcooked breading. ICK....don't like cornmeal. Which IS WHY I ASKED!! So anyway, I ordered Extra fish because I was told yes to the wet batter and got stuck paying extra for crap. The beers are overpriced and the food was not that great. Never again, yuck! If you are looking for for hot and spicy crab legs boiled in a bag....I suggest Angry Crab. Much better!!!",

She immediately ran to the bathroom because all she could think about was that she possibly already ate something that she shouldn't have. When approached by the manager, he stated, \"I won't give any excuses, unfortunately this happens at times\" WOW! I was appalled, why would a manager of a food establishment be comfortable relaying to a customer that they have a bug problem from time to time??? We immediately left and we will not be back!",

To make a long story short , the service here is horrible . The food is below average , seafood gumbo had shrimp shell bits and tasty like it was setting in the pot for hours .

Our drinks came out pretty fast followed by our appetizers. He engaged us in conversation and we was talking about his tattoos.He was really friendly and made our lunch that much better. There was also another Adrian there  that made us laugh as well.The food was really good and fresh, I ordered the calamari which came with this really good dipping sauce,The shrimp buck has a nice kick to it if you like spicy.Overall I would definitely come back here again next time I'm in Arizona.",

The server checked with us a few times, a manager came by asking if our food was ok, and they put fun bibs on us before we ate.   Thank you for a nice evening out, Joe's!",

For someone who isnt really a fish eater, i enjoyed this place!   3 stars? Waiter was GREAT.  Hostesses? TERRIBLE. The girls were snotty and stuck up while not even greeting us or bothering to notice we had even entered. When i told them table for 2 please, the 2 girls just looked at me with a disgusted look on their face and said they were busy counting menus that it would be a 40 minute wait. 40 minutes?! There was hardly anyone in there for a sunday at 8:00pm! When they finally sat us the girl didnt even bother to hand us our menu instead threw them on the table and left without saying a word. Uh ohk?   Im a little torn on coming back. Food was great, service was not the best. Food isnt worth the price if you cant even get decent service.",

The staff was always friendly and my food was always correct. So I waited to write this review to see if I still felt negative about my last experience. On Halloween my son & I went to this location it was kids eat free. When we arrived around 8pm one whole side of the restaurant was already closed down and there wasn't a lot of people maybe 10 tables. Our food took over an hour to come out my potatoes were raw and my crab legs and corn were cold. The waiter wasn't too friendly and seemed like he was ready for his shift to be over he never offered refills. When I told him about my potatoes no apology he took them and came back with more that were uncooked my corn had so much seasoning I could only eat one side. For almost $40 I expect hot odd that is fully cooked and asked if we would like a refill. After this experience I will just cook my crabs at home instead of wasting my money and being treated wrong . I was a customer like the people at all the tables. I still tipped the waiter even though he did not deserve it doing the bare minimum. The casino has crab legs twice a week for a better deal I suggest going there instead.",

Wait help are dressed in the Joe's Crab Shack t-shirts (that are also available for sale)  Did not have any appetizers, but started off with some cocktails.  Hubby had their Bloody Mary (spicy) and it was outstanding.  I should have had this instead of my usual.  We both had the Samuel Adams Steampot that consisted of lobster claws, snow crab cluster, clams, sausage, potato and a cob of corn.  It's steamed with Sam Adams brew.  It was very good for a casual place.  Love that Old Bay seasoning was used.  Skip the butter that they serve with the food -- just dip your seafood in sauce at the bottom of your plate of the steampot -- makes a world of difference.  Service was excellent and staff were helpful, courteous, and friendly.  Would definitely return to this place on our next visit to AZ.  Want to try everything on their menu.",

It seemed like he was there to just do his eight hours and then get out of there. After we finished our meal he took the plates but the rest of the table was still a bit messy. We ordered dessert but we had to clean the table ourselves just to make sure it was clear.I don't expect an immaculate table but at least make an attempt to make sure the table will be ready for when my dessert arrives.

I was in here last week and it seemed as though the staff went out of their way to be unobservant of our waiting to be seated, with my girlfriend being brushed aside by a staff member going toward the bathrooms without so much as a greeting/acknowledgement.  After half flagging someone down (who seemed quite irritated to be bothered by our presence) we were shown to a seat near the bar.   We waited for a moment and our drink order was taken promptly. After that we chatted. Waiting for our server to come take our meal order, we chatted through many subjects....then crickets. Looking around, there didn't seem to be a server in our area. The bartender occasionally would look in our direction. Finally, the bartender came over and asked if we were ready to order.   Waiting waiting waiting again. The meal took close to 40  minutes to come out. The salad for my girlfriend came out at the same time as the meal, and after the food finally arrived, the bartender, and manager were at our table asking how everything was about every 5 minutes or so.   In all, not a positive experience. My girlfriend's salad was more dressing than anything else. The food was so-so, but the service was dismal.  With all the good places out there ready to be gracious and welcoming, I can't suggest this as a place to drop your hard earned cash.",

    "text": "Being a displaced Jersey Shore girl (the year round residents, not the wankers from up north and NY who comprise the cast of the MTV show of the same name)  I have grown up knowing that the best basic seafood comes from little run down looking places, especially fish markets with a few tables outside the front door. I'm not talking about seafood that is done as a form of art such as Eric Ripert executes at Le Bernardin- I'm talking minimal preparation with little more than lemon juice, butter and Old Bay seasoning.  The kind of food you get at the legendary Berkeley Seafood Market in South Seaside Park, or used to get at Spike's market in Point Pleasant before they changed hands and raised prices a decade ago.  I've never been a fan of corporate restaurants, and derisively refer to Red Lobster as the Frog Lobster.  My first experience with Joe's was in Toledo, OH, when they opened up in 1996. Back then they had an overly unctious crab soup my ex was enamored of, and more raw bar offerings. One thing that has been consistent however is the coconut shrimp, and that's why I go there. Unlike most chains and non chains alike that buy the coconut shrimp frozen and pre-breaded, Joe's breads their shrimp to order as fried shrimp should be breaded.    I confess I don't bother to order any of the fish filets or other items at Joe's, but I will say that they get the straightforward items right- crisp fries, fresh coleslaw without too much vinegar, sugar, salt or mayo and balanced in flavor and I do like the chutney like dip for the coconut shrimp. My bf has been going to Florida for over 60 years and he likes the fried shrimp so it must be decent.  Maybe I'll go there the next time I get a yen for classic fish and chips, but living in Buckeye it's easier to just do that at home.  So, everything in life being relative, if you're looking for basic fresh seafood prepared simply, eat at Joe's. Anything more elaborate, wait until you're in a town on a coast.",

The waitress was obviously new but that didn't bother us that much except she got our drinks wrong. I think it might of been what we ordered but when we opened the lid it was cold, and had way too much flavoring. However, the part that didn't suck was that we got $11 off our appetizers from an email coupon. We're not really planning to go back based on our visit.",

They seated us at a table where my family and I were split up. We had to ask to be moved. I ordered fried clams, they messed that up and brought out plain uncooked clams. It took 30-45 minutes to get the correct clams 10 minutes after I got my food. My crab was way over cooked. My moms food came out cold. We had to wait over 5 minutes just to get forks. They didn't even try to offer to take the clams off my bill after messing it up so much. It seemed like no one knew what they were doing or how to do their jobs. I was very disappointed with my experience. If I could leave a zero star I definitely would.",

When I received a bill with regular menu prices and questioned it I was then told I needed to sit in the bar area for those discounted prices. How would I, the customer, be aware of this without the host or waitress stating it explicitly. The manager came over and offered the same LIMP/WEAK justification and zero offer of resolution. His caveat being I'll know for next time. HARD PASS! Looks like I'll be spending my money at the Angry Crab on my next visit in town. Sayonara Joe's!!",

The decor, like most of their locations, is extremely cluttered. The T shirts and other items they sell are at the front when you walk in. It's really loud, so don't come here expecting deep conservations.  The wait wasn't long because we went early. The waitress was average, but didn't really stand out. She did her job, but that was about it.   I had the peel and eat shrimp appetizer. The shrimp were fine, but nothing beyond what I could do by defrosting shrimp from the grocery store.  The crab basket was nothing memorable and was a bit over cooked and too salty. I was not too impressed, since crab legs are fairly easy to cook.  Nothing really exciting here.",

A $90 lunch that was not worth the cost at all.  The s'mores dessert however was delightful and decadent. I was very pleased (so were my kids)!",

I started off with a Passion Fruit iced tea which was probably the best part of my entire meal. Between the two of us, we ordered the Sampler Platter, lobster bisque soup, the Crab Cake Burger and the Surf N' Turf Burger. The bisque tasted like it came straight from a can, the seafood, crab and cheese balls was the only thing I liked from the sampler and both burgers were pretty meh. The saving grace of this visit was the service, which was pretty good minus the trainee who didn't seem to want to make eye contact or speak to us. Oh well, she was learning!  I had heard great things about this chain and was pretty excited to try it, though it was kind of a let down to be honest. If I ever return to a Joe's Crab Shack, I will probably order what they're known for, which is the steam pots or their fried platters. Maybe I'll have better luck then.",

    "text": "For a very long time now I have been wanting to go to Joe's crab shack. Last night my dad drove from his hometown to the city where I live and We had planned on a dinner night. I begged him and begged him about going to Joe's crab shack. After last nights experience I am never going back to that place again. Our waitress was rude, she seemed like she had no idea what she was doing. I asked the waitress to bring me some sugar for my tea she comes back and says I'm sorry I didn't bring the sugar I will get you some right now, she never even came back. We made an order and I got the crab daddy feast to share with my boyfriend hoping it would also be enough to share with my brother and my dad it was $40 for this bucket and said every kind of crap that they had came in it. I asked for butter and lemons. She forgot about the lemons and butter. One of the rude managers randomly stopped at our table and asked my dad if he needed another beer. It was completely empty for a while. My dad ordered the tacos.. another random guy  brought out a disgusting plate that had fish and broccoli we told them it wasn't his order. I feel bad eating in front of my dad and him having to wait to eat. They bring out his tacos and we're already all done eating. He said the tacos were nasty they look like they were just thrown together quickly and he said that they had no flavor. The bucket they gave us was like five legs of crab, definitely not worth $40. all the way around this place is completely shit. I went and talked to who I assume is one of the managers there and told her everything that happened and that it was our first night and that I was completely embarrassed to have brought my dad there. She cut me off and said that they were really busy and that they were trying their best. Soon after she comes up to my table and apologizes for cutting me off with the smirk on her face and you could tell it just was not sincere. I was angry at this point and told them that something needed to be done. they tried to offer us One slice a free cake. Seriously? Do you really think we wanna wait there after we just told you you guys have shitty service? The waitress comes back awkwardly says I'm sorry and walks away. we watched her at the other tables  other people seemed mad.. you could see her screwing up the orders and walking away with the same plate that she tried to give them. We have finished eating 20 minutes before we got our check and all they did was take off my dad's plate of tacos. We paid $91 all together for a terrible night. Joe's crabshack? More like Joe's CRAP shack.",

Management was on point and extremely friendly, making sure all of our needs were met and our experience was good. we eat out a lot and his has far exceeded our expectations. If you plan on visiting Tempe, go to joes, get amazing sea food and great southern hospitality.  And if you get vimani as a server, you have one of their best servers   - Charlie and Madison",

It was crab,shrimp, sausage, corn and potatoes and I devoured it all by myself :) The fish that the hubs ordered was really thin and dry, but he liked the shrimp.

Then they handed me off to a server who took me to her section, but the only tables she had were huge tables - and I was a party of one. So I said, no problem- I'll just eat at the bar.  I went to the end of bar and found an empty seat. After a couple of minutes I was able to get the attention of a bartender to help me. He was pleasant and took my order.  My side salad came out super fast and my appetizer of stuffed mushrooms did not take long either. Both were good - nothing amazing, but tasty.  Then I waited for my fish. Grilled Mahi over rice with a side of coleslaw and broccoli - pretty simple.  The lady next to me sat down after my app arrived and ordered a drink and a burger.   After about 15 minutes the bartender said, let me check on your food (never saw him again). Another 5 minutes and the woman's food arrived. Then I said to a different bartender - do I need to catch my own fish? Yes - my patience was thin.   The bartender went in the back and came back 60 seconds later with a steaming hot meal for me. He did apologize and the food was average/good. Nothing special.  Also sitting at the bar, myself and the woman next to me were freezing. The cold air blowing full blast on us. She was lucky to have a jacket, which she put on to eat - I just  froze.  I wouldn't go back.",

I came here after a long road trip from California and this was the first place we stopped for dinner. I waited and waited and tons of servers passed by but none came to my table. I was eyeballing who I thought my server was going to be and I sat there for 15 mins without service. I had to go to the hostess to ask for service. Finally the server comes back and says she was busy doing other things and didn't know we were seated which was a crock of... I made eye contact with her and she was busy chatting and inadvertently walking around instead of running from tAble to table busting her butt. She asked me if I knew what I wanted you drink. At this point it had been 25 mins. You think after this much time, I don't know what I want to eat?!? I would've left but my husband was set on staying. As far as my steampot, save yourself the $30 and go pick up the bottom of the barrel, puny crab legs. That's what they refer to as \"snow crab\". If you want big crab legs, you pick the \"queen crab\". The calories on the kids menus were a joke. The idiot that thinks that just because applesauce is unsweetened, it has no calories, needs to go back to school. False advertising and misleading information. This typically is a fun spot but is definitely not getting my business from here on out. I hope the time she spent serving the other tables worked out in her favor. I guarantee you I would've tipped more than any of them had I had proper service. Her loss, not mine.",

The Two dollar menu with appetizers and drinks is the business! The crab dip is definitely the best ($5). $2 fried pickles and calamari are a close second, as for the voodoo chicken, I can't vouch for the voodoo portion of it but for two dollars, I'll take it. The fried shrimp n fries was nothing to write home about. If you're planning to order a sandwich from the menu, you should definitely pass on the crabby patty because it's pretty dry and unflavorful or at least not what I was expecting. We can leave that to SpongeBob. But the two dollar hurricane... #TurnUpTuesday",

Since there were available seats at the bar we decided to sit there while we waited for our table.  Our bartender Elizabeth, personable, friendly, courteous, multi-tasker. This young lady was on top of it! They had a rush and got crazy for awhile. The smile from her face never faded. If she took a tad too long she was apologetic, her customer service was on point. So guess what??? When our table was ready we decided to stay at the bar and order there!  The food was good the service was better! Thank you Elizabeth for your great customer service.

Took 15-20 min just to get a waiter as two tables that day after us received their drink orders and they ordered heir food already. Once I went to ask for a waiter was given a free desert for our wait but still waited a long time for everything.",

We waited even longer to GET our drinks.  This didn't even include ordering food, much less GETTING it.  The waiters/waitresses were always hanging out by the bar, laughing it up and completely ignoring their customers.   The food is very bland.  The crab legs tasted like they had been sitting in a freezer for a while.  Poor service, terrible food, don't waste your time or money going to this one!",

They had way too much pepper for one thing and no breading at all.  It looked like they shredded some crab and tried to make patties that didn't stick together and them baked them....they were HORRIBLE!  The side of coleslaw was about 2 tablespoons worth in a paper cup!  I've been here twice before....and didn't care for it either time so shame on me for giving them another chance!

Second, the location is extremely far from my home. It takes a good thirty (30) minutes to get here. Given that, the place does a great job in servicing its guests. Wait times are good and the attitudes of the servers are great.  Thirdly, I would recommend that they open the menu up to those that aren't seafood connoisseurs. Albeit a suggestion, please take it to heart as it would bring me here more ofter (rather than being dragged here).   Lastly, aside from my distaste of seafood (yeah, it's a trend here), the experience is great. The staff is great, the restaurant is great, and the overall experience is great. Aside from the lack of choice concerning the food, I really can't complain. I would recommend this place.  Additionally, the price is mediocre overall, but considering that lobster is not cheap, it is about average. But you do get a lot!",

    "text": "Sure we have one by us back in the South Bay that we never go to, so we saw the commercial before leaving and I added it to the itinerary as a b onus it is not far from the resort we stayed at. I think we found a new seafood restaurant to add to our list. The prices are reasonable and the service is good. The place is not very clean though. We watched the servers as they cleared the tables around us, just drop the stuff they wiped off onto the floor. One table had a puddle under it and they tried to seat some people there but they asked for another table and they never cleaned it up and sat another couple. But enough of the negative (Just check the seats and under the table before accepting table). The food was great, I ordered the fisherman's platter so it had Popcorn shrimp, a generous fish filet, Great balls of fire (handmade seafood and crab with jalapenos mixed with cream cheese and coated with breadcrumbs fired up and served with Ranch dressing) and fried calamari (The calamari was a little overdone) but the overall meal was amazing and generous. I think we got our money's worth though we were too stuffed to order dessert. My wife ordered the Skillet Paella it sure looked great clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops and sausage with a tomato based sauce and served over rice. YUMMY! We'll definitely go back and try the ones closer to home.",

I had asked the waitress if i could have it without alcohol but she insisted that it was better with it so i went for it. I ate the shrimp alfredo and my boyfriend had a burger. the alfredo was alright nothing to special about it, but the burger and fries were BOMB!. dont get me wrong i love my seafood but i dont know about their seafood seems kind of funky.  i would say go to the waffle house across the street. 2pm - 9pm all you can eat.   and the food is better and a lot less expensive.",

The spicy style was good but the fire-grilled was outstanding!  Both included plenty of crab, corn on the cob, potatoes & sausage. Everything was very good & we finished with the Key Lime pie. It was excellent & more than enough for the 2 of us.   Great service topped off the experience & we'll definitely return!",

I got the shark bite drink it was good but not very strong. Three of us split two crab buckets. We had the Sam Adams with crab,clams, sausage and corn and potatoes. It was good but not anything memorable. The other bucket I didn't have much of but it featured a different kind of crab that was spicier and better flavor then the Sam Adams in my opinion. The environment is fun and the service was good.",

    "text": "Joe's Crap Shack is a more accurate name for this overpriced, tasteless restaurant.   I'm not sure what we were thinking when we decided to eat lunch here yesterday. One of my dining companions was lured by the word \"crab\" and a stomach twisting hunger, so we stopped in. Everything on the menu sounded good in theory, but it didn't pan out so well in practice.   For $9.95, I expected the crab cake sandwich to be almost a work of art- succulent crab, perfectly spiced and neatly fried. Instead, the sandwich was a lukewarm lump, devoid of flavor, unless you count the lingering aftertaste of old fish. The remoulade sauce served with the sandwich was tasty with fries, but it did nothing to save the sandwich from the pits of nastiness. The crunchy fish sandwich is usually served with cheese. I asked for mine without, but regretted it immediately. The fish fillets were the blandest I have ever had, and the cheese probably provides the only flavor this sandwich has. Honestly, i've had better fish fillets from the frozen section of the grocery store. Another thing to dislike about the crunchy fish sandwich is the fact that they didn't serve tartar sauce or any other condiment with it. Who has a dry fish sandwich? Blech.  The blackened tuna sandwich looked promising when it arrived at the table, with  inch thick slab of tuna steak sitting atop the bun. One bite shattered that notion. The fish was dry and overcooked, while the blackening spice seemed to be more likely ground up charcoal. No taste.   The one redeeming aspect to our lunch was the crab dip. That was really tasty, but I doubt if i'd return for just that.   Skip Joe's Crap Shack if you're in the mood for ocean critters. I wish we had. I felt dirty and cheap after paying our $46 lunch bill and walked out of the place very unsatisfied, and a little pissed.",

The waitress was hardly attentive and didn't keep our drinks topped off or ask if there was anything we needed. Dishes continued to be filled up with the empty crab legs and she did nothing, even when we waived our hands to get her attention.   Outside the place, they do have a kids playground, but I wouldn't recommend taking your kids here. Better take them to Chuckie Cheese instead. The strobe light at Joe's is annoying enough for the adults, but didn't seem to work well for the babies at the next tables either.   Save your time and money and avoid this place! If you're looking for seafood, go to The Salt Cellar. At least there, you'll get what you pay for.",
