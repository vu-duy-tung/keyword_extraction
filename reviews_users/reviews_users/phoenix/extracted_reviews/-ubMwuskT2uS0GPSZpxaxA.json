    "text": "Things have recently changed at this Flemings location.  They appear to be taking a cost cutting approach to their offerings.  We usually get nice free homemade potatoes chips during happy hour.  This has now turned into popcorn.  Which is obviously a cheaper way to go.  In addition they are not serving Prime Rib any longer which what high end steakhouse doesn't?   When conversing with the servers, they appear to be very secretive with limited information about the changes.   There is new management is all they were us say. Then they sent a creepy manager over to give us some made up BS story about the changes.. which made it worse.  I suspect they are probably having some financial trouble.  What they don't realize is because of the little things is why people go there in the first place. People on the Westside do have the means to support a higher steakhouse but you've been running us off little by little over the years.  We won't be back.  Would rather go to Arrowhead Grill or to Scottsdale for the price.",

My daughter & I had the Eggs Benedict with filet, the eggs were over cooked, the yolks were solid.  The sides were broccoli & fried potatoes, nothing impressive.  My dessert was Creme Brulee, the sugar was not melted into a solid crust on top, still granulated on top.  I expected much more for $50 a person.  There are many much better steakhouses in Phoenix, I will not be back to Flemings.",

We were there for Christmas dinner with friends and family. Our waitress was nice, but was not in tune with our group. She was hard to hear and more often then not did not always understand what we were requesting so had to ask multiple times in order to get it right.   We have always heard the food was good, but once served it was par at best. Filet Mignon was not the best considering the price. We have had better at less expensive places. Seafood was not that good either, have had better fresh Salmon from Fry's Market place.  After it was all said and done and a bill that was hundreds of dollars this place was really not worth it. Not 5 star worthy. Steak 44 or Dominicks will be our next stop.",

They have changed a few menu items, but my favorites are still on there.  We ordered two burgers, which were delectable.  The patty was so juicy and the bacon was perfectly cooked.  I had the beef carpaccio like usual.  It was great!  We decided to try the pork belly and grits. The pork belly was pretty good, but the grits were just a tad bit dry.  We got complimentary chips with our meal.  Free is always nice!  I wish I remembered our servers name.  I believe she was expecting, or I just insulted her.  But anyway, she was wonder.

Matt Spier is hands down the best server I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing! Many servers bring you a treat on a special occasion but Matt MADE this occasion special. He is incredibly personable yet professional, intriguingly communicative yet kept on point and brief, joined our celebration yet gave us private family time. He engaged each one of us, thoughtfully answering all our questions and humbly offering advice. He discovered through conversation that it was my daughter's birthday, it was our anniversary and that my father-in-law lives by the rule \"you're never to full for ice cream.\" Matt took our low-key happy hour and turned it into a full on celebration of our family honoring, with heartfelt words, a young woman turning 25, a couple celebrating 34 years together and the creed of a 89 year old. The hamburgers were delicious, the drinks Matt suggested were delightful and the party Matt threw us was extraordinary!",

Let me start by saying the service was fantastic, we had a party of 8 for my Dad's 60th and we got sat right away at a fantastic table. The hostess was very friendly and explained that we had a tablet with an interactive wine list on it. Very cool! While the atmosphere is a bit loud, we couldn't really hear one another unless we raised our voices a bit, but that didn't bother me since my little girl can get a bit loud at times and it didn't seem to bother our neighboring tables. We ordered two appetizers, the Sweet Chile Calamari which was spot on and the Roasted Butternut Squash Ravioli which was smaller than I expected but still very delicious!  The manager came to introduce himself and thanked us for coming, he gave my Dad a Gift Cert for his next visit (unfortunately we're all from other states, so he gave it to my Grandmother) and made sure we were doing alright.  The back waiter came to clear out appetizers and accidentally spilled my Grandma's water on her lap and oxygen tank...poor thing felt so bad and apologized profusely. They came to clean the mess up and brought a change of cloth table covers and extra cloth napkins for my Grandma. They were very quick and efficient!  The Caesar Salad was exceptional, by the way...I highly recommend it for all you garlic lovers! Our food came and everything was spectacular! They did buy the table two desserts as an apology for the water which were both fantastic and very thoughtful. The waitor took a complimentary photo of our family, although a little blurry, it was such a nice touch to the end of a meal. They printed it out and brought a box of truffles to my Dad to take home, which was very sweet!  I highly recommend this place and look forward to visiting my Grandma again so I can write a five star review next time!",

    "text": "WORST. FLEMINGS. EVER.   I pride myself on being an easy going customer, since I too, am in customer service. So this was absolutely a blood curdling 2 hour experience.  We had reservations for Easter brunch.  40 minutes for appetizers. Why? It had not gotten busy yet. The room was empty. ALSO, since it was just a SLOPPY bowl of ONE inedible strawberry, ONE inedible blackberry and about half of an old Fiji Apple from the reject bin.  Ordered the Steak Benedict w/broccolini. No more broccolini (at 12:30 on Easter Sunday? Odd), but I'm simple, & understanding. So I was told asparagus would be substituted.   We waited SO long. We were getting ready to leave. But we already committed to 1.5 hours, and had the appetizer from the $40/ person 3 course meal.   Once served (1.5 hours later), we were delivered over cooked, cold, green beans instead of the asparagus.... Huh? And then this cold, Benedict with \"sauteed arugula\" aka unseasoned, bitter, pre cooked 12 hours ago, arugula.   We missed our Easter plans for the afternoon, since we were there, waiting on food, over an hour longer than anticipated.   I just wanted to leave. But dessert was included, berry cobbler. Literally, a bowl of cooked down fruit w/sugar and MAYBE some Aunt Jemima's syrup. With a dollop of ice cream...   We received a complementary $25 gift card for joining them on Easter. I will sell this to anyone for $1.50. Just kidding. I'll give it away for free. Maybe even just throw it in the trash, because i would be utterly embarrassed to refer someone here.    This location is a franchise embarrassment. The other Flemings' we've been to puts this one to SHAME.",

She explained that some of her patrons get upset if the whole table is not carded. It was an awkward conversation.   Our drinks on a few occasions were empty. I thought it was usual for a server to wait for a glass to be empty before asking if we would like to order more drinks. I also happened to order a coffee with desert. I finished my coffee and I asked for a refill, but the refill never happened.   I wasn't wowed so this establishment goes on the list  *if there's nothing else around and I am feeling extra spendy * (not often).",

    "text": "Another wonderful experience at the Flemings in Peoria. My mother and I both indulged in the Sunday/Monday Prime Rib dinner deal. Which includes a salad, prime rib, your choice of a side, and a dessert of your choice all for $35. Such a great deal and a huge amount of food.  The prime rib was cooked wonderful and was packed with a lot of flavor. It is also accompanied by three dipping sauces: horseradish, some mustard sauce, and an au jus. I choose the chipotle mac and cheese which is my absolute favorite, best mac and cheese by far. For dessert I got the signature molten chocolate lava cake, to die for. My mom got the carrot cake which is also divine, comes with a bourbon caramel sauce that puts it over the top.  I'm a regular at this location and every time we go it feels like we're visiting family. The staff is always so kind. Alex was out waiter tonight and he did a great job.  If you're looking for a great dinner with amazing service head here. They are also amazing when it comes to special occasions.",

Wait for it wait for it...  I went there last July for my birthday with my daughter and the food was average I got home an hour later I was sick on the toilet and I'm sure you can imagine how that is!!  That way it gets better... it's now Easter Sunday and I wanted to take my daughter out for Easter dinner and I thought I'd try Flemings again!..   The service was great as usual the wine tasted good however I asked the waitress for the lamb chops if every good restaurant sells lamb chops with either mint jelly or a mint jelly sauce I can't believe that this restaurant does not have any kind of mint  jelly for lamb chops who would've thought when you pay $65 for a meal and you can't have MINT jelly!!  Oh well I guess I decided to order the lamb chops anyway because I just wanted some good lamb chops so they brought me a whole rack of lamb and I ordered the medium but when it came it was almost on the rear side!.. there were so much garlic in the meat so much garlic's in the potatoes so much garlic in the bread I think the garlic was to hide all the screw ups I guess but after the third lamb chop I wasn't sure if I was getting a bad taste in my mouth or we just heavily seasoned!!!  You got it once again an hour after I left the restaurant I'm on the TOILET!  Now I could've been a little easier and as all of society is now running of politically correct or you shouldn't say this or that I spent $200 and an hour later I'm on the toilet yes I could say I'm in the bathroom or indisposed but who wants to spend the next three hours on the toilet...",

We both had burgers. You get your choice of cheese, super wonderful bacon also is topped on it. The French fries are the shoe string type which are great. 2 apps, 2 burgers and 2 mango ice tea's for $40. I think that's a great deal for the high quality of food.

The service was unbelievable. This was our 1st wedding anniversary. We were so glad we chose Flemings.   They always used our names and were genuinely friendly. Even the general manager, Marc, came by to welcome and thank us. He gave us a nice gift too.   We ordered steaks and Flemings potatoes along with desserts. We were very pleased with our meal. This is gong to sound crazy but we couldn't stop commenting on their ranch dressing. I could have poured that on my dessert. Must be lined with crack or something. It was creamy and perfect. Best wedge salad ever. Bacon was a little odd tasting. I have to mention the blueberry lemon drop. Delish! My husband commented that's the 1st time he's seen me finish 2 drinks at dinner. I could have drank another.   Service...where do I start? Great group of people. The hostess lady was friendly as can be. Gianni was our server and she was amazing. She knew the menu well and gave recommendations with confidence. Even the busgirl, Betty, was friendly. When was the last time a busser has addressed you and struck up conversation? I was impressed. She made us laugh. They really have a good team of people to take care of their guests.   I can't figure out why we haven't gone sooner. We are always in the area. Rest assured, we will be back!  They really went above and beyond our expectations.",

The flatbread was the table favorite and was loaded with steak. I find a lot more value in happy hour at Fleming's then in their dinner and would come back again for it.",

Petite filet mignon, medium rare was 5 star!! Creamed spinach was 3 star, as was the loaded baked potato - neither had much flavor.  But the caesar salad was worth 4.5. OK - overall, I'll say 3.5 star.  Since I can't do that, a 3, because the total experience just wasn't a 4 I've not tried Ruth's Chris in Scottsdale, but my experience with Ruth's in other cities has been better than this",

    "text": "Oops. This review is pretty late. I came here with my family for New Year's Eve! I was excited to try a steakhouse in the West Valley, in hopes of having a steak option close to home. Unfortunately, I don't feel like I'll be going back. The filets my family had were dry, tough and salty. It probably didn't help that we had dined at Mastro's for Christmas Eve (amazing!) so I think our expectations may have been on the high side. My dad ordered the lobster tail, which was small and also dry and tough. The cheese in the French Onion Soup was not fully melted, and there was A LOT of cheese. For dessert we got Creme Brulee. It was the highlight of the meal for me since I have a huge sweet tooth, but not enough for me to want to go back to Fleming's any time soon. I will say, that though the food was subpar, the service was great.   **If you do decide to go here, check out Costco for discounted $100 gift certificates!",

Everyone greeted her with a 'Happy Birthday' - she received a gift card and box of truffles with a candle. We all felt very special. Now to the meal - OMG - my husband and I ordered the steak - it was cooked beyond perfect. The filet was so tender I didn't need a knife to cut it. Our daughter (a picky eater) had the swordfish - which was the first time she had tried it - and LOVED it. The green beans were wonderful too. For desert - which we hardly ever get - we decided on the chocolate lava cake. There are no words...that cake is AMAZING!!! Our waitress - Tiffany - was excellent. She even offered me a black cloth napkin - instead of the white - because I was wearing black pants and she didn't want white fuzz on my black pants...talk about paying attention to detail!! We didn't feel rushed at all, she answered our questions about the meal. We will definately be going back again. Although it is expensive - it was so worth the trip for a birthday dinner.",

My children are perfectly behaved and I've received compliments everywhere I go because my kids are so good you hardly know they are there. That doesn't keep some nicer restaurants from making you feel like lepers. In fact, the reason we went is to celebrate my 11 year old's Honor Roll achievement and from the waiter to even the manager, the staff made a point to come by and congratulate him on his hard work.  The food was wonderful. Although my steak was a little short of medium, the Flemings potatoes always make up for that. And the chocolate lava cake at the end? OMG. But my favorite is the chantilly whipped cream. I could eat a bowl of that all by itself.   So I'm looking forward to going back to this Flemings and I really do appreciate how kind they were to my son on his academic achievement. They didn't have to gush so much, but they were genuine and very sweet.",

    "text": "My boyfriend & I went to Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar last night before the Phoenix Coyotes hockey game. We wanted to take advantage of the '5 for $6 'til 7' menu at the bar, as well as, the Spring Break Celebration dinner.  I can honestly say that we had an absolutely amazing dinner and that we were so happy we chose to go here before the \"big game.\" The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!  The highlight of our night though was the Baked Oysters Rockefeller appetizer. We ordered a half dozen oysters that were cooked to perfection and had the right amount of spinach, bacon & cheese. (I think what made these oysters so great was the creamy spinach used- I think it is the same as the 'Creamy Spinach' side you can order off the menu.) Highly recommend!  We, also, ordered the Spring Break Celebration which was a choice of The Wedge Salad or French Onion Soup. The entree was the FIlet Mignon & North Atlantic Lobster Tail. The side was a choice of either French Green Beans or Fleming's Mashed Potatoes. We got all this food for only $34.95. What a great deal!  I chose The Wedge Salad which was a perfect starter to my meal. The lettuce was crisp and the tomatoes were fresh. The Filet Mignon was an impeccable 'Medium Rare' temperature and the North Atlantic Lobster Tail was generous. Also, I chose the French Green Beans as a side because I am trying to watch my carb intake. The beans were fresh and the mushrooms were a great compliment to the side dish.  Also, as I stated above, we sat up at the bar and I am sure glad we did because Adam, our bartender, was very sweet and took care of us. I never had an empty glass of wine ;)  Overall, my boyfriend & I typically do not like, for lack of a better word, \"chain restaurants\" but we believe that Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar in Peoria does it right! They have an outstanding FOH & BOH. Keep up the good work!!",

Now the meat of the issue: the food. There was not a bad bite over three courses. I started with the Cesar and my husband had the clam chowder. The Cesar was perfectly balanced. Normally I really don't like clam chowder but I tried a bite of his and it was delicious; not too fishy. He says, \"it was thick and amazing. They didn't skimp on anything. It was the best I ever had\" Perfect. We caught a prime rib special and this was not the church's prime rib charity dinner! This... it taught me the difference between fat and gristle. This melted in my mouth. I've had butter that wasn't as good as the fat on this beef. It was as served with 3 sauces a standard but not over salty aus jus, a  horseradish that only makes you cry for joy, and... they called it a mustard but...Husband doesn't eat mustard and he loves this. Neither of us could pick a favorite. The Flemings Potatoes are my favorite. Don't let the jalapeno scare you they won't burn you. Dessert is a sinful mystery you need to discover for yourself.

It's been a while since we've been to Fleming's so we were both looking forward to it.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  LeAnn was our server and she was awesome.  She recommended the Eponymous Cab.  It was pricey at $20 per glass.  But worth it.  Nice, well balanced cab.  We started off with the toasted mushroom ravioli.  Delicious.  Filled with tender mushrooms with a butter porcini sauce.  How to get all the sauce?  How about that mini loaf of sourdough they bring you!    We both ordered filet.  My wife ordered the porcini crusted filet and I had the main filet.  Both medium.  We ordered the garlic mash and roasted baby carrots.  The steaks- cooked perfectly.  The manager came over a couple minutes after we cut them to make sure they were to our satisfaction.  They were.  I had a side of peppercorn sauce with mine as well.  Fantastic.  The sides- the mash was nothing special.  But those carrots?  WOW!  Don't think of grocery store carrots when you think baby carrots.  Not even close.  The carrots were roasted with golden raisins and slivered almonds.  Those could have been the best part of the meal if I wasn't such a steak lover!    LeAnn gave us a complimentary box of chocolate truffles as well.  The food was fantastic but the service was above and beyond.  We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I'm generally not one to write a negative review and I'm cautious to judge a place based on negative reviews. I must say I'm not very impressed. I'm giving 2 stars based on the food alone. While the food was delicious the service was poor at best. We went with friends from out of town for a birthday dinner and all of our plates got mixed up. Not just the plates themselves but each of our steaks was with the wrong item. So we couldn't just switch plates because my medium rare steak was on my friends plate with her crab cakes. So all plates had to be sent back to pair the steak with the right \"turf\". Once that was fixed one person in the party didn't get their food until all of us finished our meals, we would have waited but then all of ours would have been cold. For a restaurant on the spendy side I just couldn't believe how bad the service was. Again this could be overlooked if they were busy but we were there for an early dinner and their seemed to be plenty of staff to support the amount of seated tables.   Aside from taking our order and bringing our food our server didn't check to see how we were one time. While the food was tasty I was shocked to leave a place that charges $50 for surf and turf hungry. I figured the portion would be decent and a side might be too much food but that wasn't the case. That was just our experience there. Had the service and circumstances been better, I could overlook leaving hungry given how good the food was but there were just a lot of let downs that left me feeling embarrassed I picked that as the restaurant to take our friends to celebrate their birthday.",

    "text": "While looking for a gift for our tax accountant, we came across a recommendation to try this place out.  After parousing their website, it turns out they were doing a special Easter Sunday Brunch.  We decided to book and check the place out.   My friend Stan Reinhold, a world renowned chef here in AZ, let me know this was a great place to go so I was happy to have the reservations as soon as we made them for such a popular holiday.  Our reservations were for 12 noon, just 30 minutes after they started service for brunch. It ran through 3pm and there was not a free table to be had.  As soon as one was vacated, it was dressed and refilled before you knew it.  Its very dark and intimate, probably a great place for an anniversary or private moment with friends or loved ones.   All dressed in black, as were his counterparts, was Kevin, our waiter.  A pony-tailed boy off about 25 who appeared eager to take care of us. We started with a glass of the house Chardonnay and a Mimosa, which was one of their brunch special cocktail.   The full Sunday Dinner Menu was also available for those not looking for the brunch fare but we came for that so giving the regular menu its due, we opted to do brunch as planned.  This was NOT a buffet as are most high end establishments and their brunch offerings.  It was a set menu, with several choices.  We both had the same palate so our selections were identical.  Starting course was a fresh berry plate with a Sour Cream-Vanilla-Honey sauce that was very nice.  Beautiful fresh fruits and plenty of them.    Round two was a Crab Frittata made with Swiss Cheese, Mushrooms and Asparagus.  It was also served with a crispy Hash Brown, 2 sausage links and a Roasted Tomato half.  Interesting presentation, a good portion and quite tasty.    Dessert offerings were three....New York Cheese Cake, Creme Brulee' and something else that was unmemorable.  We opted for the Cheese Cake and its additional side of sweetened cream along with a piping hot coffee.   All in all, we were there for the better part of an hour and a half.  The service was paced so that nothing came out until it was supposed to, which was nice.  There was a moment or two where it seemed to have gotten so busy we were left unattended to and our waters were in need of refilling for a bit too long.  (Kevin, you were nice, but your stock is plummeting)  Also, the tag-line Kevin used repeatedly when checking on us was getting old....\"How's that working for you?\"  Time to come up with something new.  I hate to think my dinner is \"working\" in any capacity.    So, the bottom line is this.  Go on payday as there is nothing inexpensive about this place.  Morton's or Ruth's Chris it's not but certainly trying to get there. Plan on spending some time and don't think you will just zip in a zip out, its not that kind of place.  The food was delicious and you should expect nothing less. Would I go again?  Absolutely!  Would I recommend it to a friend?  Without a second thought.",

We had made reservations and noted that it was his birthday and none of that information got transferred to our server, I had to tell him when my boyfriend went to the restroom. We ordered from one server and then at the start of dinner, realized she had left us with another server, which honestly ruined the experience. No mention of her leaving, no manager visit, it took a while to realize someone else was taking care of us entirely because we were looking for her to order another round of drinks, which we never had the chance to. No one asked how dinner was, which mine was overdone and his was underdone. Our new server cleared the table when I was still eating and therefore I couldn't finish my meal. He didn't even notice, nor ask. We asked for a box, and typically they box for you, but the box was literally thrown onto the table as he walked by. I was looking around for a manager but none could be found. When leaving, no one was at the host stand to talk to either. It was such a disappointing experience from somewhere we've been before and choose to spend lots of money at. The food doesn't make up for the lacking service, so we likely won't be back. My recommendation is to sit in the main dining area, where service for us has always been great. The bar area drops the whole Fleming's experience.",

I was asked to join some friends as a single in a group where they asked to separate checks. Most had a pleasant experience as they shared plates etc. The waiter seemed to ignore me for the most part. It seemed that he realized that I would be the lowest tip. My tea drink was empty that he noticed but walked past. My entree arrived without the potato and vegetable that I ordered. He didn't notice or check as it was served.  The manager came by and I explained my problem. He went to fix it but most of the group was at least half done when it was resolved. They all had to wait until I was done to consider deserts. When it came to pay, I told him that I had a Dine Rewards account and gave him my phone and account #. (which in the past has been ok to receive credit in other of the Bloomin Brands chains) He never processed either but gave me a new card which is useless to me, unless I want to start over earning credits. Little things like this bother me. As some of my staff and business partners dine there, I sending out a memo today asking them to report similar Dine Rewards and service problems there. The next step will be stopping corporate reimbursements of entertaining there.",

The manager Marc was awesome we definitely enjoyed our experience at Flemings and will be going back",

    "text": "I can't believe I lived right down the street from this restaurant and never tried it. I feel like a complete fool.   The main dining area is an open spaced area with appropriate dim dinner lighting. Even sitting at a table, I still had the feel of privacy because of the lighting. The people I encountered were extremely friendly and (easily seen) truly proud of their restaurant.   LeAnn, my waitress, was extraordinary.....more on that later   They brought out bread with two types of spread. It was delicious but, since I was dining alone, stopped after sampling each type of spread. Both were delicious.   I started with a gin martini (as usual) and the lump crab cakes. What a treat - mostly crab and light on the fillers....perfect for a light appetizer.   After I was finished the manager, Mike, came out to great me and check on the service so far. Very pleasant and happy to welcome people to the restaurant.   I ordered the bone-in ribeye over the fillet (which I definitely need to try) at the recommendation of the waitress. I paired it with the Kenwood Cab. It was everything promised. My concern was that the steak would be over cooked. Usually, when I order steak out, I need to specify \"on the rare side of medium rare\" to make sure it is correct. I really shouldn't have worried. What you order is how it is prepared. It was juicy and tender as promised.   I finished with the carrot cake and a cordial. I must note that all the deserts are made in house and not frozen. Again, the dessert was perfect.   Before the dessert came out, I was greeted by Scott, the Operating Partner. He was clearly proud of this location and the chef. He was just checking on the service and ensure I had a good evening.   SUMMARY:   All in all, and those who know me know that this is a VERY RARE SENTENCE for me to commit to writting....but.........I have absolutely nothing bad to say about my experience at the Peoria Fleming's.   The waitress was attentive but not intrusive. The timing of the meal presentation was perfect with a steady flow of food and appropriate breaks in between. One of the problems I find most insulting at restaurants (feeling rushed or getting your next item before finishing the previous) is something no one should ever feel here.   One recommendation for improvement (to make a 5+ rating in my book) would be to have the wait staff remark on the local chef's creations. The \"specials not on the menu\" are the local chef's creations......maybe say something to remark on the uniqueness of these items not on the menu......\"our local chef has prepared a few items you wont find at other Fleming's\" or something to that effect....I know, minor, but there is always room for improvement LOL.",

The service was like they had better things to do than deal with us and the prime rib seemed like it was made a couple days prior. Just not very good at all.",

I guess we figured she would be a little more grateful, since it would probably come out of her check. We will definitely go back because of the great food.",

I have eaten at some of the nicest steak houses in the country and Let me assure you, they know what they are doing here.  3) online ordering. You can show up and just start being served without having to bother with menus at all if you want.    4) super fancy! Their wine list menus are ipads.",

    "text": "We've been coming here for years and the last couple times - in April 2016 and again in June 2016 - it has been less than impressive. The most recent time in June was on a Saturday evening and the main filet was delivered under cooked and was a poor cut (lots of veins and impossibly hard to cut - I even asked if they used meat glue as the cut was that poor). The main filet was ordered medium well, but it was delivered medium to medium rare. Yikes! Not a fan of bloody meat personally. Additionally, the ribeye steak that was ordered by another in our party was over cooked and not prepared with the rub as ordered. The first manager had the kitchen cook the filet more, however ignored that there was a decent portion that just wouldn't cut. So I had to ask the other manager if I could get a petite filet as the last 1/3 or more was inedible. The second manager apologized and agreed that steak should not have been sent out. So long story short, I finally got a somewhat decent steak I could eat but ended up eatting alone as everyone had already finished. They were kind enough to remove the main filet off my bill and replaced it with the petite filet on in its place which I am okay with as I did eat the steak. It was just disappointing at what it took to get a subpar steak for the money spent on it. The total time it took for soup, steak and coffee was over two and a half hours - so be prepared for a long dinner if you go. I plan to make the drive to Ruth Chris in Scottsdale in the future if we are wanting to guarantee a good quality steak in the future.",

He answered all of my friends questions (and I think he had 20)...he probably felt interrogated but handled us well.  I ordered the filet with Gorgonzola and the wife had the fish special (no idea what it was since I am not a huge fish guy).    My steak was fantastic and I also ordered the creamed spinach which was also very creamy and delish.  We did not order desert but had plenty of alcohol and then we pretty much closed out the place before heading to the new Toby Keith's and then Sandbar to close the night!  We dropped about $400 for all 4 of us which is pretty standard for an upscale steak house.",

The service in the bar was prompt and courteous.  For appetizers, we ordered the Flemings Potatoes (starch, cheese, jalapenos) - what could be better?  We also tried some green bean and asparagus.  These didn't survive the trip around the table.  I skipped the salad and concentrated on my fillet and baked potato.  Other than one of the servers spilling my client's steak on the floor, the service was great.  I'll still give them five stars.  No sweat.  He was very apologetic and they turned around another steak very quickly.  Their creme brulee is awesome!!  If Fleming is on your list to try, don't wait.  Great food and atmosphere.",

This time though the service was sub-par.  Our waiter was nice enough, but not very attentive.  Several times we were looking around wondering where he was.  This has NEVER happened to us here before.  When we were served our food, my son's girlfriend did not get her soup, so we had to ask for that.  We had ordered some mushrooms to go with out steaks, which also did not arrive and had to be asked for.  We also would liked to have ordered some wine or other cocktails, but our waiter was nowhere to be found.  When it was time for dessert, we were not offered coffee (although we could have asked for it when we ordered). After dessert was brought to us, we thought we might like some coffee, but our waiter wasn't around.  After we finished we waited for quite a long time and finally my husband had to find the manager to ask for our bill.  If this had been Sizzler or Outback Steakhouse this wouldn't have been such an issue, but this is Flemings.  It should have been awesome.  It wasn't.  This is the only time we have not had attentive service here, so we will likely give them another chance, but this was disappointing.  For a $600+ meal, we expect excellent service.",

This review is purely for the West side venue but I have been to all the Flemings around here now and all surpass expectations.   Very busy on Friday nights and I recommend booking tables which was easy with their website.  Steaks, fish &a seafood are cooked to perfection.  Side dishes range from the traditional to the adventurous with jalapeno mash and oven roasted Brussel sprouts.   Wine selection is huge and you can get a bottle from 30-$$$$ if you so wish!  This is the only place I have found Duvel beer served here in Phoenix.   Shout out to Randy for helping to arrange a surprise for our anniversary as well as making sure we were all taken care of throughout the night.   TIP: Costco members.  You can get $100 gift cards for $80 figure that's a 20% discount on the bill or the tip!.  Ideally figure $100 a head spending.

I knew they were out there, I just never saw one before. It was awesome, I can't wait to do that when I'm older- and that's precisely the reason it was so awkward. We were clearly strangers in this huge group.  The Queen Bee of the group has huddled with some of her friends, they're gawking- pointing. Clearly confused on our being there.  Finally a busser comes by with water and chokes on the palpability of the awkwardness. He asks what the hell was wrong with us, and after realizing it was all just one big misunderstanding, tells us that we can move to another area. We ended up moving, and having one of the best meals we've ever had in our lives.   Fleming's cheese potatoes are one of the best things I've ever eaten and the steak was comparable to my amazing experience at DK's Steak House in Waikiki Beach. The service was incredible and it was all worth it.  Would definitely recommend for special anniversaries, important business meetings, and fans of Flapper costume parties.",

The Brussels sprouts and bacon is good enough to bring me back - next time I will order two servings. The real key, though, was the service. Anticipated every need while remaining unobtrusive. Our waitress, Megan, was thoroughly knowledgeable of the menu. She turned a great dining experience into a top notch one.",

    "text": "My husband and I were here about a week ago with 3 other couples! Great food! Everything was tasty and had great presentation! The service was awesome. Each table has 2 to 3 servers & they are definitely on top of things. We had an appetizer called the Seafood Tower. Superb! The meals were equally amazing! We had the 3 course meal which was prime rib on a bed of mashed potatoes with a side dish, I got the Caesar salad. They do serve the side dishes family style, which I enjoy, cause then I get to taste a little bit of everything. The desserts are equally delicious! I had the creme brule' & it was so light and fluffy! My husband had the carrot cake but only had half cause he ate his whole meal but one negative, (which was small) was when the server took my husband's carrot cake to the back to pack it to go, he brought it back stuffed upside down in a round styrofoam container! Horrible presentation! I am not a fan of having any of my food removed from the table to be packaged in the back! I always ask for them to bring the container to me. I wanna know what & how my food was handled & by who! Overall it was a great dinner! Definitely going back soon! And maybe it'll be a 5 star review! ;)",

    "text": "I am basing this review on last nights food alone.  Other visits to Fleming's have been fabulous.  We went specifically for the Prime Rib.  The Prime Rib we received was nothing like those pictured in other reviews.  It was small, it was thin and had a significant amount of inedible fat.  To be honest with you it looked as though it had been warmed up, not fresh.  The only spice you could taste was Rosemary, no garlic, no salt, no pepper.  The Au Jus was also very bland and lacked flavor.  The French Onion soup, the Fleming's potatos, and the Creme Brulee dessert were delicious. We were there early, not sure if that would have played a part, but we were disappointed.  Will surely go back again, as I don't believe we have ever had a better Rib Eye anywhere.",

Tips: it's about $50 per steak. A couple of sides to share, a bottle of wine...a good family bonding time later, you can do the math for four. Again, the kids gave it a kudos! I like the happy hour better. Smaller portion, twice the wine tasting, and triple the fun with friends. Cheers!",

    "text": "Food was good but the experience with service was unacceptable. I really do not have the time to list everything that we did not like service wise.  Hostess was friendly and we were seated promptly (we had reservations). Our server was very nice and friendly (that was not an issue) but the service overall was terrible.  May I add, even if our bill had been comp'd (which it was not) we would not come back to this place.  Just a sample: From the very first round of drinks, one person in our party did not get his drink, for a very long time.  For almost everything, we had to ask multiple times to different people, even the manager (or whoever goes from table to table asking about your experience, this includes drink refills, bread, bread spread, butter for the crab, the sauce they offered with the steak, etc). My husband had ordered the bernaise sauce and they forgot, he did not want to start eating until he got it, but it took so long that he gave up and had half his meal without it. Some of the stuff we got after asking several times, some of it we just stopped asking.  When we got the butter for the crab (again, after asking multiple times), they brought it in one of those containers with a warmer, but the warmer was not on.  I do not think I had been to Fleming's ever before, but we go to Ruth Chris' (Scottsdale) a few times a year and I was expecting a comparable experience. Service there has always been superb.",

We got the shrimp appetizer. The horseradish was a blob on top so we had to mix it. My shrimp still had shell. It was ok. I got the lobster tails. They were rubbery. Once again, ok. We got the creamed spinach and it was runny, pretty much spinach artichoke dip minus the chips. The server was nice and took it off. The potatoes were sticky almost like boxed potatoes. My husband got the filet minon. It didn't melt in the mouth like it should being medium rare. We've had better at Durant's and Arrowhead Grill never disappoints with any of their steaks. The manager went to all the other tables around us and never once stopped by us. I dunno, maybe we didn't look \"rich\" enough lol. We wore nice jeans and nice tops. Definitely don't have to dress up to eat here. Other people said they got gift cards for their anniversary. Yeah not us. For 2 people we spent 250.00 which is what we expected but for the price it was not worth it. We will stick to Arrowhead Grill from now on.",

I'm a family man with one child under 7 years of age two older kids in the work force and I'm in health care as a director of nursing but I still look for deals and quality... That being said Fleming's was an accidental booking for me when I felt the need to try something new with my family over the weekend ... We go out 2 x per month I would say because quality food is truly hard to find. So while at Fleming's I ordered the seafood tower because I'm tired of Red lobster being the main stay in AZ. I was beyond impressed with the freshness and quality of the presentation. I'm from Long Island  NY where seafood means something and this was as good if not better then the food I enjoyed in long island or Manhattan. We also had the Fleming potatoes.. all I can say is OMG!  There's nothing else to say folks.. please try them. My family had a simple filet mignon and again very very nice. The check was on the high end but it was worth the outing to say the least. If you need to impress someone or simply treat yourself look no further... It's not a place I would go to every weekend because of the high end bill but I truly never thought about the bill after the fact. I simply look forward to going back there very soon..",

We thought why not, early dinner and the evening to ourselves. Plenty of parking at 4 as well and we hoped the place wouldn't be packed. 21 open tables and they seated us basically in our own section! AWESOME!! We were rejoicing. Very quiet and private, BUT WAIT FOR IT.....Here comes the hostess with another couple and she parked them right next to us!! 21 OPEN TABLES!!!!!! I could smell the guys cologne better than my wife's perfume. He was not happy as well, as noted by the rolling of his eyes. There wasn't room in between our tables to fit a good sized waiter. I decided I would have a word with one of the \"Operating Partners\" what the ---- is that? He looked the situation over and asked if WE wanted to move. Are you serious? What are the people who just sat on our laps going to think if we up and move now that they showed up. Not well versed at his craft, he did nothing and said nothing to his hostess' as they kept bunching people up with plenty of open space, it continued for the next hour.  The food well that's different, always awesome no matter what we order, never a disappointment and the wait staff are top notch otherwise I'd have rendered 2 stars. I Decided to give Fleming's a very long break while I search for a better organized eating experience. Been here 5 times at least. This type of seating situation occurs an awful lot around the Phoenix area. I guess we're supposed to get to know our neighbors and sit close enough to eat off their plate.",

This location has always been decent but we have still slightly preferred the Scottsdale area however we both live close to this Glendale location. We were in shock with our visit this past Friday. When you think Flemings- you think classy and high end- unfortunately, this time around, that perception was gone right away as we walked in the door and saw how the hostess was dressed. First impression is everything and we walked in and she was wearing a very tight, very short leopard dress or skirt with very revealing cleavage. We thought for sure her dress was going to ride up as she walked us to our table. Very inappropriate and not up to Flemings standards in our opinion. As far as the food goes, last time we were in, everything was fabulous, the steak couldnt have been cooked better. This time, that was not the case. The steaks came out much smaller than they usually do, kind of rubbery on the edges and very under cooked (they took care of the under cooked steaks immediately) Over all- Flemings is fantastic- we were just very disappointed this time around. When paying that much money- you want everything to be great from start to end. We will still come back- we just hope next time the staff and food is up to par.",

We were in the area at the time and this Fleming's seemed to be the best restaurant in the vicinity.  We both ordered the French onion soup to start.  i tried about 4 spoonfuls and found it to be so salty that I asked the waiter to take away.  Given that it hadn't been very long since we received the soup and the bowl was still pretty full, I would have expected the waiter to ask whether or not there was a problem.  But no.  Finally, I informed him that it was way too salty.  His response? \"Oh?\" No \"I'm sorry\", \"Can I get you something else?\", \"I'll let the kitchen know.\".  Nothing but \"Oh?\"  Since their steak portions are usually too big for me to finish, I decided to try their braised short ribs.  It was so dry that I asked for more au jus, but that didn't help it.  My husband said, \"Wow that's really bad! Don't eat it.\" He ended up giving me some of his steak, so I wouldn't starve.  What was the  waiters response this time?  The same.  No offer to deduct the soup or offer a complimentary dessert.  Nothing.  We've been to other Fleming's around the Valley as well as one in Chicago and have never had such a bad experience.  Hopefully, this is isolated to just this particular Fleming's.",

Our server was friendly, clean and they work in team he had his very own helper which was great . My sister steak was just a little under cook for her, they took it and corrected it right away. After the end of dinner the manager came to our tables to see how was everything then gave dad a gift certificate for $25 a gift for dad. What a great idea. Great touch Fleming . We will be back .",

Idk maybe he was trying to be cute or funny but someone at our table asked what the salad dressing was for the wedge and he says \" uh blue cheese?\" in a question kind of  way as if \"duhh\" - then when my hubby asked for Italian instead of his \"blue cheese\" he said in a sing songy kind of way, \"oooookkkkkaaayy\" as if we were being too particular. This guy was about 40 I guess, short, with glasses. It seemed like he had been employed longer and knew the ropes more than the gal (Charity) or the Spanish guy. Did not care for his attitude at all! It was almost as if he thought we were getting a free meal why should we get it exactly like we want??!! Charity (I asked her name)/ on the other hand was most gracious, most of the time \"silent service\" was very professional. She went to get us go-boxes for what we couldn't eat, kept our water&tea glasses full, and gave NO attitude at all! Didn't expect to need any cash for tonight! Otherwise I would have tipped her!!! not him-the food WAS fabulous! The surf and turf was served and I had the double chicken breast. The brulee for dessert was wonderful too! However, when we speak to Stuart again we may comment on this experience.",

We were seated in the private room and had a couple of drinks and snacked on the complimentary bread before we placed our order. The bread was good and they served it with butter and an herb spread. We started out with calamari and oysters. The calamari was a little too rubbery for my liking and the sauce they served it with was just okay it tasted like sweet and sour. I don't eat oysters but my friend said they were fresh. For my main course I ordered halibut with shiitake mushrooms with creamed spinach. I wanted to order the chipotle macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes but I didn't want to get too carried away. Luckily the couple next to us ordered those sides and shared it with me. The macaroni was to die for and the potatoes were really good they topped it off with a parmesan peppercorn butter. The service was great and the food was excellent its worth the price even though I didn't have to pay!",

The server (Daniel) is probably the best one in the place, very friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, etc.  His service made up for my steak being over cooked (for the first time ever), also the meat is so perfect, it can take the beating.  I like my steak medium (their Filet is the best I have ever had), and it was probably a minute of two over that, so it wasn't ruined at all, just not exactly the way I like it.  I refused to complain.  My Mom had the seafood bisque (recommended by Dan), it was mind blowing, she couldn't fight me off it :)!  Their creme brulee is the best I have ever had as well.  I just wish they had an original potato al gratin, instead of a southwestern one.  I adore the crab cakes, and get them every time I go.  The drinks from the bar are always perfect (Mojitos and Margaritas are what I get).  We love this place!",

My wife and I split the NY Prime Strip, not the aged one.  It was done perfectly.  We had a baked potato and charred Brussels sprouts.  All excellent.  After hearing Gordon Ramsey likes Molton Lava Cake for dessert, we had to split that one too.  So good.(see photo which did not include the bowl of fresh whipped cream).  Complimentary valet parking was a breeze.  It was pretty cold in the Restaurant, and we were glad we brought our jackets. No hassle or charge for splitting everything for us.  Dinner W/O alcohol, 20% tip and $3.00 for the parking it came to ~$130.00 for dinner.  Money well spent!",

I had heard that other locations they give desert or discounts for the number of years you're celebrating.

    "text": "How unfortunate. The food was stellar. The service, not so much. We went on September 15th for drinks and light fare. We had never sat in the bar area before.  The bar was packed, the dining room almost empty. To note, I am not used to being treated like a second class citizen.   Nonetheless this is how we were handled from check in with the hostesses (no smile and an attitude- not surprising for most 18-year-olds, but surprising it is allowed in a restaurant such as Flemings) to checkout.  They had opened dining tables as the bar was full but limited choices. Staff acted as if we were inconveniencing them when I inquired if there was another seating possibility as my friend has back issues.  It took her several minutes (leaving us standing in the middle of the dining room amidst strong dining waiting to see if there were other tables) before she returned and said no.   As we watched the dining room, it was apparent staff was being gracious and accommodating with the majority of the patrons, just as we have experienced every single time we've ever come here.  It was highly embarrassing as I had brought a friend you would never been to Flemings and I had been raving about how great it was. Unfortunately this was not her experience. In fact we never ordered dinner after the four appetizers and drinks and left.   Every other time we have dined here, the manager generally walks the room and asks if everything is agreeable, the manager was walking throughout the restaurant but he looked very serious and not exactly happy. He never came to our table nor did I see him go to any other tables to check on their experience. I missed this little bit which we had become accustomed to.  Our female waitress which started the evening, was not very friendly.  I pointed out a dead black bug on our table when we were seated, she just wiped it off the table. No change of the linens, no manager, just swept it off the table.  However in the middle of our experience, she left and a young man took over who was much more friendly (unfortunately we were already leaving at that point.) Flemings get it together with your staffing. I've never had such deplorable service while being charged hundreds for a meal.  Disheartening.",

Three of us  had the filet specials, and the steaks were perfectly cooked. My mother didn't realize there was a sauce on it, and they quickly replaced her steak for her. My dad had the short rib small plate, which was the favorite item of the night. We also loved the calamari appetizer with the sweet and sour glaze with pepperoncinis.",

    "text": "I have now been to Flemings in Peoria twice. The first time,  it was massively busy. But we were seated quickly and had the full attention of our server, Trent, in about a minute.   Our server, as with the bussers, the other waiters, etc. were all attentive, polite,  and fast.  As it was a holiday,  I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of attention we received.  Trent was fantastic,  attentive,  and fun, as was warranted by our manner. However,  I never judge a restaurant by the first visit.   So, I went back tonight.   We were seated in a different area and had Rachel as our server. She was very good.  Fast, attentive,  and responsive, and again nearly everyone who passed our table checked on us.  It was another busy night,  but at no time did I feel rushed.  I was able to take my time and delight in the complete meal.   The meal was delightful.  The wine selection was superb. The price was reasonable for a higher end meal.  I can recommend Flemings without hesitation.  A fine experience that I am glad I had.",

Someone looked at me through the door, turned and walked away.  Not even a \"we're closed\", probably because they knew it was before 10:30.  This was on June 26.  So we didn't have an opportunity to eat there.  And it's unlikely we'll come back.  Actually, I'm quite sure we won't.  So we made the best of it and went next door to BJ's, and had a fantastic dinner there.   Granted, it was our anniversary and we were eating deep dish pizza, but we've been together long enough to roll with it and our waiters there was fantastic, personable and offered great suggestions.  I'm sure the West Valley will have more steakhouses soon, and we'll try those out as they arrive.    Really poor show, Flemings.",

For appetizers we had the chili calamari and the crab cakes. Both could have had a bit more crispy-ness to them. The crab cakes were a bit soggy for my taste. The calamari was good despite the lack of crunch and I really enjoyed the variety of bell peppers in the dish. I had the wedge salad which was fantastic. Nice plump tomatoes, crisp iceberg lettuce, thick bacon and Chunky bites of blue cheese. I had the lobster and my partner had the Ny Strip. We shared a side of Brussel sprouts. The Brussels were absolutely delicious! The strip was like butter. Melted in my mouth. The lobster was good. A tad over cooked though I'd Say. We skipped dessert as we have a Valentine's Day cake from San Francisco via Whole Foods at home. All in all Everything was wonderful. Pricey, But would probably Return.",

    "text": "Hubby brought me here for an early Mother's Day dinner. Sure it helped that we had a $50 coupon, as it is kind of pricey, but it's a nice place to go for special occasions. We decided to splurge and start off with the chilled seafood tower. I seriously could have just made that my entire meal and been happy as a clam! It contained four jumbo prawns, two lobster tails, two crab legs, and a bowl of ahi tuna with avocado and wonton chips. Hubby really enjoyed the light citrus sauce on the ahi tuna and I really enjoyed the side of mustard sauce with the crab. They also start you off with a loaf of fresh bread and two different spreads. One tasted like a salmon and the other (which was my favorite) was Brie with champagne. For my entree I chose the Miso Glazed Sea Bass and it was exquisite. It was served on a bed of wilted spinach and garnished with pickled onions. Hubby chose the ribeye and he enjoyed it immensely. Both of our entrees were cooked perfectly and we had no complaints. For our size we chose the Flemings potatoes and the brussels sprouts with bacon. The Flemings potatoes were really good and reminded us of au gratin potatoes with a slight hint of jalapenos. The brussels sprouts were braised perfectly and finished with a balsamic glaze. The crispy bits of bacon really finished them nicely. Our waitress was very kind and attentive and we left fully satisfied with leftovers for the next night!",

    "text": "We recently had an enjoyable experience dining at this Peoria steakhouse, and thought the impeccable service and ambiance was worth another future visit. We arrived before dinnertime and were seated immediately. The restaurant's layout consisted of a sizable patio for outdoor dining, and a dim-lit interior with full bar, small candles, thick white tablecloths, and a cozy dark wooden decor.   The Colossal Shrimp Cocktail ($20.95) was a wonderful starter. The shrimps were humongous, fresh, and meaty, with a memorable texture. The horseradish-cocktail sauce was balanced, smooth, and refined. It was addictive. I could eat these all day long.  The 12-ounce Main Filet Mignon ($49.95) with Truffle Poached Lobster ($13.95) arrived with a thick cut filet mignon cooked to rare. The steak was easy to cut into, but the center was still a bit raw and cold. The caviars were marvelous, but the lobster appeared smaller than the shrimp cocktail. I wished I had ordered something else besides the lobster. It was not worth the add-on.  The Barbecue Salmon ($39.95) came with sizable filets of New Zealand salmon and our choice of Sauteed Mushrooms ($11.95) on the side. The salmon was very tender and tasty, accompanied by the hint of black pepper, sweet barbeque glaze, and textured earthy beech mushrooms. Moreover, the Sauteed Mushrooms had varied tender textures that came with a nice chew. The natural earthy flavors were incredible. I would definitely order the mushrooms again.  The Chocolate Lava Cake ($14.50) was made with a chocolate cake, hot molten center of Belgian chocolate, vanilla ice cream, and chopped pistachios. The chocolate cake was good, but I thought the use of ice cream could be more creative. The warm lava could be darker with a hint of bitterness, but the chopped pistachio was a good difference maker. I had higher expectations for their dessert, and would likely go with the Carrot Cake on the next visit.   Service was attentive, incredibly warm, and knowledgeable. Our server refilled our warm basket of bread on several occasions, and the side of Brie butter and Parmesan peppercorn butter were truly outstanding. I usually don't use butter on warm bread, but these were so worthwhile and addictive. Overall, interested diners can expect a wonderful dining environment, decent food, and very attentive and knowledgeable service. I would be interested in returning to try the Chilled Seafood Tower, Bone-in Mignon, Mac & Cheese, and the Carrot Cake with dark rum caramel.",

I was really looking forward to a nice meal.  They start with biscuits that come with butter and honey.  The biscuits were stale.    Everyone enjoyed the first course, salad, soup or burrata, all tasty and fresh.  They offered several versions of eggs Benedict so I tried the one with crab cakes.  Underwhelmed...the poached eggs were virtually raw, more like coddled.  By the time someone came to ask we were halfway through our meal.  I asked for some scrambled eggs with veggies instead and the waitress was happy to oblige.  They discounted my meal to 16.95.  Others in my party enjoyed their food, the sides were great.

    "text": "I came here to Fleming's to take my best friend and her parents out for a thank you dinner. I've only heard of Fleming's but had never dined in for dinner. I decided to try this steakhouse out being that it was within close distance to the house.   I made reservations for 4 for 6:30. We were running a few minutes behind so I called and asked to change the reservation to 7:00, the lady said it was okay.   We arrived around 6:40. The hostesse(s) said it would be closer to 7:00 for seating. I don't know how they managed to fill our table within 10 minutes but it was fine. One of the hostess came and told us there was a booth seating available but it was next to the bar. We went to sit and decided it wasn't what we wanted. I asked how long for our normal table and she said it would be at 7:00, again that was fine even though I didn't understand why the long wait.   We were deciding on a bottle of wine to chose from. Our server was anything but helpful. He was more trying to up sell me. That was an instant turn off for me towards the service and restaurant. My best friends mom likes red Zinfandel. I asked what varieties they had. Our server pointed out one red Zinfandel but insisted we wouldn't like it and said he believes we would like these other two different kinds of wine instead and insisted on bringing those two instead. I was very irritated and insisted he bring the one I asked for, also. You can tell he was very hesitant and irritated but he brought it.   I had my best friends mom do the wine tasting. Like I figured, she enjoyed the red Zinfandel instead of the other two selections of different wine that he insisted on.   Upon ordering it seemed as if he hadn't even tried any of the entrees and again was trying to up sell us. My best friends mom asked about one of the small plates, he instantly suggested about getting the steak instead of telling her how the small plate choice she asked about was.   3 of us decided to go with the 6oz filet minion and my best friend decided on the double chicken breast. I ordered all of us the side of lobster and we also had the shareable sides of asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, and mashed potatoes. We also ordered mussels for our appetizers.   Our dinner was delicious and cooked perfectly. I can't complain about the food. We also ordered another bottle of wine and had creme brulee for dessert.   There were different servers coming out bringing our plates but none of them asked how everything was or if we needed anything. The plates were extremely hot, too hot honestly, that my best friends mom burned her hand and she had to cool it off with the ice water. They didn't even apologize for that. Also, my wine glass had a bug in it. I told our server and he inspected the glass hesitantly and didn't even apologize for that either.   You would think after spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars you would get 5 star service but that wasn't the case here. I guess if you want 5 star service, it's best to go to a 5 star steakhouse which this place was clearly not. If you're willing to spend hundreds of dollars and want good service, go elsewhere! Very disappointed in the service. Mastro's it is next time!",

Early dinner shouldn't be a problem without reservations but looking for prime time, plan ahead. I was able to book same day on OpenTable. Food was good, the filet was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. Crab cakes were tasty and loved the mushrooms. The husband was obsessed with the butter that was a great pairing with the bread. Where the 3 stars comes in was more the service. The waiter was nice enough but for a $200+ meal I expect excellent. Over all atmosphere could use some desire. For west valley I'd recommend Arrowhead Grill over Fleming's and to make the drive Mastro's City Hall a better option.",

Manager accommodated us early despite the place being packed. Food is definitely shareable as the portions are huge. We started with the lobster bisque soup (one serving plenty for 2 people) followed by had the bone in ribeye with shrimp diablo over the top, with shareable sides (family style) of lobster Mac, carrots, and Fleming's potatoes. Our waiter, Tommy, was awesome and patient answering all our questions and making great recommendations when asked. The steak was cooked to perfection. The sides were awesome. Specialty drinks very good and great wine selection. For dessert we tried the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake and creme brulee. Both were awesome although I prefer my brulee warm and this was not. We will definitely return.",

    "text": "First time at Fleming after trying the majority of the Steakhouses in phx/Scottsdale. I brought my wife here for her birthday and must say their attention to detail is incredible. The steaks were a 4/5 I would still say A Different Pointe of View at the Tapatio Cliffs is a better steak. However, the steak was still very good. Service was overall outstanding with multiple ppl stopping by to assist with dinner flowing smoothly. Our main server was very dry and didn't show any personality at all. She also didn't seem to have much knowledge about wine whatsoever which is a little shocking at a place like this. The lobster tail was par for the course and nothing spetacular.   The ambience is pretty perfect for a romantic dinner with that special someone. They brought my wife complimentary truffles for her Birthday and they were delicious! They made sure to wish her a Happy Birthday numerous times and even provided her a gift card for a return trip. Overall a very good and worthwhile experience. If the steak was a touch better and the main server more personable the 5 stars would have been an easy decision.",

The Caesar salad was very tasty and the small plate sliced filet was the most perfectly balanced and seasoned dish I can remember eating in recent memory.  There was so much going on in that dish - but everything was balanced and picture perfect.  I can't recommend this place enough.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Flemings for awhile, so when a group of friends suggested the restaurant for Arizona restaurant week, I decided to jump on that chance. We made a reservation for 11, and were not seated too long after our reservation time. We were greeted by the server within minutes of sitting down, but that's when things started going downhill. Although I do understand the restaurant week menu provides a less hit to our wallets and therefore the server may not be expecting as much of an earning from our table than regular tables, I did not expect it to make much of a difference. I have gone to plenty of fine dining establishments for restaurant week without an issue. However, we didn't receive our appetizers (soup or salad) until about 1 hour + after we were seated, which I find a bit ridiculous. I have worked in the restaurant industry for 7 years, and I know it's common sense to update your customers on the status of their food if you expect it to take a little longer than usual. The server had an hour or more window to do so, and yet we received no updates or apology. Instead, we decided to remain polite and feed ourselves with water and bread. Although the wait between the main entree and dessert was not nearly as long, it was still surprising to me how long everything took. I know we had a large table, but 1 hour for appetizers is quite excessive. Although our two servers were polite, one of the servers made us feel slightly uncomfortable. He tried making jokes with us, but it registered as an odd vibe. I gave Flemings 3 stars because the 12 oz filet was seasoned and cooked well, and also the manager came by to thank us for coming. However, the spinach and potatoes were not satisfying to say the least. They tasted almost as good as those microwaved frozen dinners you can buy from Costco. The cheesecake was okay, but the walnut turtle pie that some chose to order was terrible. It was covered with more walnuts than actual pie. Walnut after walnut. I'm lucky I did not choose that dessert, and I felt sorry for those who did. The cream that was on my cheesecake was even better than their entire dessert all together. Needless to say, I most likely will not return to this establishment, as it was neither worth my time or money.",

I order the main filet mignon mid rare ($45) and the , she ordered the certified Angus beef.   Filet mignon was bland, not enough seasoning, small.  Potatoe was way too hot and mushy inside.  The Angus beef had way more flavor and it had some type of crunchy tortilla underneath.  In total the price for the food does not overcome the taste.  I wouldn't recommended it to anyone. Way too expensive for the mediocre service and food.",

There had to be about six or seven people wishing her a happy birthday throughout the evening. It was as if the whole place knew about it - she was so happy. My steak was cooked exactly as I requested it (Medium, because I'm manly) and the food arrived in a timely manner (As always). Our server today was Charles and he was nothing short of magnificent.

Our waiter was Curtis and he was fabulous. Honestly, my daughter even said she liked him and she is super shy! He was very knowledgable. He explained the wine selection perfectly! He was a bit confused on the menu though after being gone for several days, we put in an order but then came back to tell us that it was no longer the special. So that was a bit werid. But he was very nice about the whole process. He checked on us frequently which was appreciated. When we got our meal I was cutting up my daughters chicken strips and found a huge string. Curtis was right there and said sorry and took the plate away, apparently a dish towel had fell in the fryer! We asked for another veggie plate so she had something to eat while we were eating. By the time my husband and I were done with our meal hers came which was a bummer because she was full on carrots. The kids meal was nothing to get excited about the fries were very greasy. We ordered the mint lamb chops which had tons of mint on them, it was overloaded. We also got the special of scallops and the steak which was perfect completely. I think you really need to stay with meat at this place, they know how to make it! We did get their great lava cake for dessert again which is fabulous. We did tell them we were there for our anniversary and they gave us a box of truffles to celebrate which was very nice. When we got the check we were surprised that we were charged for the kids meal but then once my husband paid the manager came and gave us a $25 gift card because of the issue. I would have been happier if they would have just taken it off the bill. I had a better experience but still a bit surprised about a towel falling into a fryer for how upscale this place is supposed to be!",

We had a larger group and I think they did an amazing job making sure we were all happy.   The Food: We started with oysters as our appetizer and they weren't too far off from the best I have ever had. Ice cold and flavorful! Shoot away. I usually pass on salad or soup. I get salads elsewhere. This is my carnivorous place. I ordered the filet mignon med rare and it was cooked to perfection. I prefer a nicely peppered, salted steak cooked to perfection. I am not the soaking in butter steak guy. Go to Ruth Chris for that. We ordered the Fleming's potatoes and asparagus as our sides. The potatoes are a legendary staple and the asparagus is always slender and delicious.   The Drink: Here is my one downfall. Almost as important as the steak are my Martinis. Usually you will get the best martinis at steak houses. They shake them a little longer and the bartender usually knows how to properly use vermouth. Well, my first martini was more like a half of a martini. It was also slightly chilled. My second was a full martini, but was so over vermouthed that I almost gagged. Slightly chilled as well. When you pay more for a steakhouse martini, you kind of expect more.   I will always make Fleming's one of my steakhouse go to's. May just have to give a little more direction on the martinis.",

When recently trying I decide where to spend our anniversary dinner we decided on Flemings because of the always impeccable service, very consistently amazing food, and warm, cozy atmosphere.  We were seated on time with 3 well wishes for our anniversary from various staff. We were seated in an awkward table but asked to be moved right away and they seated us in a close by booth. (We later saw 2 other tables ask to be moved from the same table so we are thinking it would probably be good to rethink that table location)  We had the Oysters Rockefeller 2 years ago and were still thinking about how wonderful they were so we asked if they could be made because the weren't on the current menu. Our server graciously told us they could make us some.  They were amazing just like last time! We each had a fillet with the Flemings potatoes and asparagus. As usual the steak was fantastic and all sides were perfect. We finished it off with the creme brulee and coffee. It was another perfect meal with excellent service. Before leaving the manager brought over a $25 gift card and house made truffles with well wishes for a happy anniversary. We will definitely be back to celebrate as soon as we are able. Definitely recommend this restaurant for a wonderful experience in both dining and service!",

    "text": "I have to write this down immediately. And I am going to do something I typically don't which is include personal information about myself. But in order to give full comprehension, I will be talking about my family. To me, it's worth it in my book for this one...  My wife and I don't get out much. Busy lives, work, family, etc. We have been passing over anniversaries, birthdays, unexpected (but wanted!) pregnancy, and all other special occasions because of time. We recently purchased a home (buying a home and moving=no time) and after spending somewhere in the neighborhood of a quarter of a million dollars, the builder gave us a $50 gift card to Fleming's. Finally! A chance to go celebrate all of these passed over dates of significance! Ship the daughter off to grandma's, pull out some extra cash, and make the reservation.  We arrived at our reservation time and were seated immediately. The hostess was friendly and politely chatted with us as she seated us at a nice table pretty much in the middle of main dining area. Comfortable chairs, nice lighting, fairly intimate setting. We knew what the menu held after reviewing it online first so we knew we were starting with the crab cakes. After ordering the crab cakes, my wife and I started to slow down and get into the date night vibe. The crab cakes were moist, flavorful, and served in a very savory butter sauce. I couldn't put my finger on the spices in the sauce but it was delectable. We are off to a good start. I ordered a boneless ribeye with king crab and mashed potatoes while my wife went for the petite filet with asparagus. The steak was outstanding. Not too salty, medium rare to perfection, juices still inside and on the plate. If I were a cow, I would be honored to be this steak postmortem. The accompanying crab was also sumptuous. My wife was gracious enough to let me try a bite of her filet and it certainly didn't disappoint. Typically I would finish what she started but my lovely better half is very pregnant so I no longer enjoy the luxury of counting on her leftovers. As a matter of fact, I lost some of my potatoes in the ordeal. Easy sacrifice to keep all of my steak. All the food was impressive.   But this is when things went from impressive to outstanding. One of the managers stops by our table and drops off a $25 gift certificate because our hostess had gleaned the purpose of our night out while she was seating us. She relayed that to the manager which prompted the gift certificate. I elaborated slightly on how it was actually making up for several occasions and he was on his way after a gracious conversation. At the end of our meal, our server then brings us a small box of chocolates with a candle on it and two cards. One card was for the anniversary we were celebrating and the other was for the acknowledgement of our impending new child each signed by the staff. The server then lights the candle and thanks us for celebrating with them. We take a small bite from the rich chocolate delights in the box and saved the rest for later.  I felt special this night. I truly feel like the staff of Fleming's appreciated our visit and were happy we chose to celebrate at their restaurant. The entire night my wife and I were looking at each other in awe of how efficient and caring the staff was. Whether it was how they constantly were topping off our drinks or the management stop by's to check on us. But when you go that far out of normal to deliver hand signed Congratulations cards, you just outdid almost every establishment I have ever been to. One might say this should be expected from a finer dining place such as this, but I have had much less expensive establishments create an experience such as this one. This type of service transcends money. Well done Fleming's. You made the customer number one in your service and meals. My wife and I had a night that we will remember for a very long time to come.",

The wait staff wishing us Happy Anniversary, our server, Jose, paying particular attention to our needs, the manager presenting us with a gift card,  Jose snapping our picture and bringing over the \"memorable moment\" keepsake photo, the gift box of chocolates...oh wait...did I mention our perfectly prepared dinner selections?  I cannot say enough good things about our experience. We were treated like Royalty and I want to share our thanks with everyone who made our night so wonderful!!!",

The girl that that first took our names and clarified our reservation was so nice and funny. We then sat at the bar for their happy hour and was kindly met by the bartenders while we waited for our table. We ordered and had drinks within seconds. The service so far was awesome!! 5 minutes later our table was ready, in which Alex seated my wife first while I payed our tab at the bar. The busser met us with bread and had a great sense of joy while doing his job. Alma was our server who so helpful and made sure we were taken care of during our entire experience. One of the managers, Marc came over and checked in on us and chatted for about a good five minute and clearly stated how he cares about his customers. I thought that was pretty amazing! Now keep in mind, you get what you pay for. Dinner for two will run a minimum of at least $75+. We racked up about $160 :-)  Great service from start to finish and several people had wished us a Happy Anniversary which on that note the manager (Marc) had given us a $25 gift card to say thanks for choosing them on our special day. My wife and I will be back and I hope their team reads this review. I can't even write enough about this place. I literally was \"wowing\" the whole way home!!  Thanks Flemings!!!",

I wasn't impressed at all, I've worked in the service industry for over 6 years and the lack of service for what you pay here is astonishing. Not only was service an issue but the restrooms were dirty and smelled of urine with dirt caked around the edges of the walls. I was also surprised at the music choice which didn't fit the ambience at all. I'd like to assume flemings considers themselves upscale due to the prices on the menu, but there were specific events that occurred that will not have me coming back. First, there were many people tending to our table but our drinks seemed to remain empty for long periods of time. Second, with our large party we received 1 complimentary bread and had to continuously request more (I understand it is complimentary, but enough should be given for the size of the party, especially when paying $30-$50 a plate), Third, one of the entrees was served with completely raw shrimp. Last, something that bothered me terribly, we asked a man that had been to our table several times what one of the sauces was and his reply was \"I don't know\", without offering to go find out or send our server to inform us he left us with \"I don't know\". This to me is completely unacceptable especially at a \"fine dining\" establishment. I hope Flemings can train their employees better in customer service to avoid losing anymore business.",

    "text": "So I have been to Flemings in Scottsdale and liked it very much. My husband had not been. We made reservations for a 10pm dinner at Flemings on Northern for our first visit. Upon entering I was concerned when I saw they close at 10:30. I asked the host if it would be better to come back another day. He assured me that they were accustomed to late night diners.  To begin with, we were seated in the bar. I was not overjoyed about that but our bartender/waiter Shaun was extremely nice and took excellent care of us. The food as well was outstanding.   However... Our experience was not one of linen table service, but instead, a big screen tv with football and kick boxing as well as a parade of trash cans being pulled and ushered out past our booth.   Not the romantic dinner I had hoped for with my husband. I guess my feeling is that if you are going to advertise your serving hours until 10:30, and expect your clientele to pay $300 for dinner (without wine); then you keep your dining room open until 10:30 and  don't start breaking down until your customers have enjoyed their meal.",

    "text": "My wife had been given a gift card for Flemings. It was our anniversary so we decided it was time to use the card. I knew they were basically a steak house but did not look them up on line to see what they had to offer. All the main dishes are meat. If you want something with your meat you order it separately. This will escalate the cost of the meal by more that $16.00 to $20.00 per person.   I have struggled on how to rate them. The food was excellent. The service was excellent. Cost was... Lets just say very expensive for what you got. We got an appetizer, salad, bowel of soup, ice tea, coffee, split a dessert. Ordered coffee for my wife and expresso for myself with the dessert. The coffee and expresso was delivered 10 min before the dessert. These should of been delivered at same time. If you drink expresso you know it has to be drank on serving. Taste changes as it sets and it needs to be consumed when hot. Cost $100.00 + the tip. If we had gotten a meat dish and a glass of wine the cost would of been $80.00 per person. I don't have any problem paying over $100.00 per person if the food, service, ambiance warrant the cost.  I rated them 3 stars. The food, was good. It just wasn't good enough to warrant 4 or 5 stars.   The server John deserves a 5. He was excellent. Very attentive and helpful. It  was a pleasure having him and his staff of 3 different people that made sure we were taken care of.   Would I go back?? No. There are many good steak houses that serve as good food for much less cost.",

I really liked that there are choices in the sizes of steak that you can order. I was a little worried when i saw that the creamed corn had jalepeno on top ( not typically a fan of that) but to my surprise it gave the corn just the right amount of zip. The combination of sweetness and heat was delious!  Our server Kurt was very attentive  and  gave us all the information that we needed to make our selections. We will definatley be returning !",

    "text": "The Main Man and I are Flemings fans; as in, we go there quite a bit, several times a year in the main dining room and almost monthly in the bar area. We are not at all impressed with the 'upstairs' overflow area... So this review might be tainted...  Our last visit was on October 21 for a big deal dinner. The reservation was made more than a month prior yet when we arrived they tried to seat us in that awful side room that makes one feel as if they are seated at the kids table during the family Thanksgiving meal. MM asked for different seating and despite open tables visible in the dining room, they stated everything was reserved. When we said we would wait for seating in the big people dining room, the hostess was visibly annoyed and went whispering who-knows-what in the co-hostesses ear. A few moments later, after they had their crisis meeting with management, we were seated in the big dining room, among the multitude of open tables that mostly remained open during our 1.5 hour meal.  Now, having been smitten with Flemings for years now, it pains me to say that the quality of service had dropped significantly and the food had taken the same route. Or maybe I have become that much better a cook... When we drop $200+ on a meal, I want the meal, the service, the ambiance, the whole experience to feel extraordinary and this did not. It was just a meal and the desert that they make a big deal about, the chocolate lava cake, is quite disappointing! With a 20 minute prep time and all the buildup, I would think the thing should knock my socks, or other undergarments, off. It didn't... It was tasty and we finished it, but I won't order it again and it isn't something I will find myself craving down the line.  As for the service, it was quite generic and seemed lacking in the refinement we have come to expect from Flemings. The hostesses were borderline rude and unprofessional. The manager, knowing we were displeased with the original seating didn't visit our table until the end of the meal and then only did so sheepishly and quickly. The appetizer and the steaks were fine, not spectacular, but fine.  Of four visits this year, this was the second disappointing visit. After the first one they said it would get better and it did, but not all the way, and not for long... Pull it together!",

Within 2 minutes, Orel Hershiser approaches my son and introduces himself. Mind you we had just come from a Spring Training Dodgers game at CamelBack ranch which is about 10 min away. My son was in amazement. The location is great. The server was very friendly, very attentive, and kept us updated with the approximate arrival of dinner. The manager came over and welcomed us to Arizona after learning we were visiting from California. I wish I could remember his name. All in all, the portions were huge, the meats were perfectly cooked, and dessert was the final touch. We will definitely return to this location when at Dodgers Spring Training.",

We went with the filet and \"colossal king crab legs \". Not only was the word \"COLOSSAL \"a complete lie but it was closer to a average snow crab leg- really wish I had taken a picture, but a manager saw it . Also it was precooked and obviously sat under a heating lamp for god knows how long. It was rubber and cardboard thin. My wife s and guests were the same. The manager brought me a fresh one which was 100 times better but No where near \"COLOSSAL \". They really need to take that description off menu.  Gave 2 stars because steak as always was fabulous!  Not going to rush back to this location. Really disappointing dining experience.  Wouldn't recommend this location,just hope other locations are still good",

There is no tap beer available, which for our party was a \"WTF?\", but they had wines available that are hard to find elsewhere.  Besides, there's more profit in wine, so that makes sense for this type of restaurant.  But it reduces my likelihood of returning since I'm a beer expert rather than a wine expert.  The salads were pretty ordinary, and seemed like courtesy add-ons to their menu for the main course, beef.  The prime filet mignon was superb, about the best I've ever had.  Perfectly cooked to our order.    It was not a busy weekday evening, so service was excellent.",

I saw Cybill Shepherd on a commercial shoot, and she took one look at the steak on the counter, admitted she was a vegetarian, and marched to her dressing room. Gee, that has nothing to do with Fleming's, but it's funny what sticks with you all these years later when I was at a company outing in Phoenix. This was the place our CIO chose for our group dinner, a generous gesture as the dinner reflected the dishes the restaurant chain are most renowned.  After taking advantage of platters of appetizers including the Sweet Chile Calamari and Bacon-Wrapped Scallops (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2kOAy0w&s=407f9c4b2d9b4c442c7228fc583b810270292673b24b36e985d3c43670233b7c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2kOAy0w</a>), we were all seated in the private dining room. We each got samplings of two salads - the Modern Caesar with fried capers and proscuitto chips accompanied by Parmesan toast (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2kZSVSp&s=e78ea500a0e771c4a10762793c0ba9d4f358bb4036cacbc0831bcf377fa5722f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2kZSVSp</a>), as well as the New Wedge with slab-cut bacon, blistered cherry tomatoes, and crumbled gorgonzola cheese (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2ksZyJz&s=5829c335d96e8e84a6a355f7e9693df9bbcb31a73aa125b8c709eeda33cac21d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2ksZyJz</a>). Both were quite satisfying with the wedge a nice translation of the steakhouse staple. This was followed by a quartet of scrumptious sides.  Fleming's Potatoes is a decadent house specialty - scalloped, molded like a brick, and heavy with cream and cheddar cheese with a bit of jalapeno (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2lqva6X&s=0db8a61d379749a9b7cf2ba30cfc58f6ddb84e482c96117562575cff118c3893\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2lqva6X</a>), and the Truffle-Parsley Mashed Potatoes, saturated in cream and butter, made it a double header of artery-clogging starchy goodness. The Grilled High Country Asparagus and Sauteed Mushrooms made a valiant attempt to offset the potatoes but to little avail (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2ksVLvW&s=f3b8583934b4b8f787974a2fd8b0c27705bbf0cb1305724b7de0b6fac1bcb25d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2ksVLvW</a>). The main attraction was, of course, the steak, and the 12-ounce Main Filet Mignon was tender, iron-crusted and drizzled with melted butter (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2kayDkJ&s=ad7daada79920f4eff7813af7710fb6c7f5c80bfe971de34991ae1b6c494e2d9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2kayDkJ</a>). Quite a treat.  As if we were not wallowing in enough self-indulgence, there was a triple helping of dessert. The Walnut Turtle Pie was gooey good with housemade caramel, walnuts, and chocolate (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2kVaBPi&s=cc15b4923df5ba5cdaec1eaa2a6293aded68cf096a3da86d6b05139f9afed899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2kVaBPi</a>), and the New York Cheesecake was classically conventional with its graham cracker crust and blueberry sauce (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2kao6pV&s=1ffc26762729f93b305d685b9c8c4f612a57a3eef177a94ae32f163b312c3bd7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2kao6pV</a>). My favorite was the Creme Brulee, a large serving of Tahitian vanilla bean custard served with fresh berries (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2kaByda&s=641ae7dd40b3a933ec6702caf80d2b70e6c17cfed1c3db86ebe3d53f1c3ab3d7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2kaByda</a>). Stuffed, uncomfortably so, but it certainly made me amenable to a return visit to a Fleming's near me on my dime. Even if Cybill disapproves.  FOOD - 4 stars...definitely a high quality steakhouse even if it is a chain AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...very manly place with a lot of wood SERVICE - 3 stars...even though we were a big party, it did seem exceedingly slow TOTAL - 4 stars...a near-classic steakhouse experience",

    "text": "It's been several years since I've been to Fleming's, and this was my first visit to the Peoria location. My husband had a gift card and, as serious steak fans, we decided to splurge for a belated birthday dinner.  I knew something was off when we walked in and were met by three hostesses who seemed absolutely miserable. Now, I used to work food service - at a steakhouse, no less - and I've worked many a difficult night, so I brushed off the lukewarm reception as a fluke.  Our waiter was quick to arrive and seemed a bit nervous, but he was more than happy to answer questions about the menu and didn't try to upsell any particular item, other than the salads - he seemed very insistent that I order a salad. Again, we didn't think much of it, but we were both pretty hungry and excited to get to the protein portion of the meal. We started with the shrimp cocktail, which was five magnificent prawns, expertly deveined, with a tangy sauce on the side. My first drink was the California Jam Jar, a light, faintly herby, and pleasantly refreshing vodka drink. My husband ordered the Old Mexico, a smoky rum number with a hint of poblano syrup served in one of their delightfully oversized wine glasses. The waiter asked him several times if he was okay with a spicy drink, so I was expecting some real kick...but it was a rich, warm, and bright drink. We were off to a great start.  We had settled on two steaks, the Fleming's scalloped potatoes, and the sauteed mushrooms. The food took quite some time, especially considering that it wasn't terribly busy for a Saturday night, but we were enjoying our drinks and conversation. Our waiter didn't return until our food did, even though it was brought out by another waiter, both of whom were trying to talk to me at once. I was ready for a drink that could hold its own alongside my filet and upgraded to a Manhattan, served up.   My filet was a solid 8oz with very little fat, and the bernaise was appropriately subtle with notes of parsley and shallot. I cut into the steak and was shocked - I'd ordered rare to medium rare, and the outside was grey. Oh no. I cut into the middle, and it was a grey-pink, a solid medium well. My plate was searing hot, and the steak was continuing to dry out by the second. My husband's bone-in ribeye was slightly overcooked (he'd ordered medium rare, and it was medium) but the tenderness was preserved by the bone, so he wasn't bothered. He did enjoy the herbaceous horseradish glaze.  Because our food had taken so long to arrive, I wasn't about to send it back and wait another 20 minutes, especially given how late it was in the evening. Besides, the waiter didn't bother to ask how it was until another three passes later. I decided to dig into the sides - I was really looking forward to these mushrooms.   Sadly, I was disappointed again. The Fleming's I remember offered a variety of creamy mashed potatoes with nuanced peppercorn and whipped butter. These were slathered with cheddar and an oil film on top - it looked like they had been sitting under a lamp while they cooked my filet to death. Meanwhile, I found the mushrooms a bit undercooked (poor moisture to seasoning ratio) and terribly overseasoned with huge chunks of pepper that we kept finding in each others' teeth. The sheer amount of salt in the meal left both of us with indigestion.  The waiter could tell I wasn't thrilled as I sawed through the leather on my plate, but made little effort to really ask me about it, which was a shame. He seemed more interested in speaking to my husband, and I was getting the distinct impression that he thought only men preferred good steak and stiff drinks, and that I was just there for show. When I remarked on how excellent my manhattan was (complemented by two luxardo cherries, a luxurious touch), he remarked \"that's because you like strong drinks!\" Uh, yeah? I also like good food, none of which seemed to be found at the table.  Even though it was getting late and the dining room was starting to empty, the waiter tried to sell us (well, my husband) on a dessert. I was over it and focusing purely on my manhattan at this point. The total came to over $200 before tip, which was just depressing - there's much better food to be had for far less! The waiter did refill my water before disappearing, so uh, thanks? We never saw a manager and no one bothered to thank us or say goodbye.  I'd be remiss if I didn't remind the ladies out there to watch your step as you enter and exit. The polished wood flooring in the entry area is slicker than a basketball court. I'm one of those women who can easily run in 4\" heels, but I was having a hard time keeping my balance (even before I had a drink, thank you). I saw another review from a woman who took a tumble, and I can completely understand why.   Based on the quality of the food and drinks, I might consider a return for a happy hour drink and an appetizer on a lazy afternoon... but at a different location. All in all, a shame!",

She also gave my roomate a little birthday card. That was very nice. The bread starter was delicious. We really enjoyed the two dips that came with the bread. We then recieved our salads. The salad was very good. We enjoyed the lemon vinaigrette dressing that came on the salad. Then came the entrees. My filet mingon was cooked to perfection and the portion was perfect. My roomates also enjoyed their meals. At the end of the meal we got a delicious chocolate lava cake dessert. We shared it between the three of us and it was delectable. The waitress also gave my roomate a box of truffles and another manager (im assuming the owner) gave us a $25 off gift card which was also very kind. We really enjoyed our experience at Flemmings and we will be coming back.  UPDATED: Went to Flemmings to use the $25 gift card. Again, Excellent service. Although I was kind of upset I was not allowed to order mac and cheese with my filet again, The food was outstanding and the filet was cooked to absolute perfection. I also tried the lamb over carrot puree.. delicious!!",

We were greeted by name when we arrived for our reservation and seated immediately. The prefix menu that featured filet, salmon and scallops along with appetizer and dessert was delicious and a great value. The sides were large enough to share and simply delicious. We had the chipotle mac n cheese and Parmesan mashed taters. The steaks were cooked perfectly and the service was awesome! We celebrated a birthday and they took our groups pictures and provided us with a framed photo before we left along with a gift if delicious truffles. The carrot cake is a great finish to the meal along with the managers checking in throughout the evening.",

Our waiter Trent was great. We ordered the special of PrimeRib. IT WAS AMAZING. Served hot and delicious. My potato was hot. My husband got the spinach and he loved it. We had a margarita each. Other than a little small for the price, it was good. THE desserts were great. I had leftovers. So other than the guy forgot to put the delicious roll in there EVERYTHING was great. The price was the best. We will be going back. Thank you...",

The Rib eye medium is perfect, completely perfect.  Seared on the outside on their 2000 degree grill locks in the flavor and taste like nothing I've ever tried.  The Flemmings Potatoes are a cheesy cream filled sensation, and to boot they have the best Lava Cake on the planet.  And seriously even the mints you take with you to go are amazing!  LOL.  Quality from the bottom to the top.    Im not a \"fine dining\" kind of guy, nothing makes me more pissed off than spending $50 on a meal for one and having to hit burger king on the way home cuz Im still starving because they gave me a 3 ounce \"french delicacy\" cut, draped in butter truffle crap, with a sprig of asparagus and a mint leaf.  Those of you who've ever tried to impress a girl know what Im talking about.  Flemmings is not this kinda place. Be prepared to drop over $100 for 2, but its worth every dime!  I'm a superfan!",

My co worker and I went for dinner and we walked in and they asked if we has reservations. The place was empty so I didn't see why that mattered. We said no and then they asked for my last name and then first. I was so put off. I don't see a need to give out that info to have dinner. Do you want to do a background check as well?  We were sat by our hostess dressed in a slutty black outfit, like the others there. Out waitress attempted to say hi by using my last name I gave them which isnt all that hard but she slaughtered it. She asked if we wanted wine but we told her no and that we wanted water, coke and lemonade. She ignored what we said and then asked if we wanted water and soda... ugh.   We were in shock when we opened the menu and saw the ridiculous prices. $45 for the filet by itself, with no sides. $10 for a baked potatoe....We were here on money from work so we stayed. If it was my own money I would not have stayed. We ordered our meal and out waitress again was clueless and ignored what we said and had to repeat our orders several times.   The food was brought out and I was expecting the most amazing steak I have ever had. The steak was fine, not worth $45, maybe 20. The baked potato was pretty decent but again not worth the money. I dont know how they can charge that much for mediocre steak. I ate everything but wasnt all that pleased.   My low rating is due to the strange vibe I got from the staff and the crazy high prices for standard food.",

Feeling tired but really hungry after the long drive we decided to try out the nearby Fleming's restaurant after checking into the hotel.  As we were one of the last patrons to arrive, most were already leaving,  I must say they gave us exceptional service. The three of us ordered the scallops, petite filet, and New York strip steak.  All of our entrees were delicious!  The presentation of the dishes alone was on spot.  We all shared a bottle of red wine the server suggested and it was a perfect match with our food.  They even snapped a picture of us and handed it to us in a little cardboard frame when they brought us the check. (We now have it displayed on our mantle).  Too bad we don't live in the area because this was one of the nicest, not to mention one of the tastiest, dining experiences we've had.",

Randy Canada, the operator partner, was extremely unprofessional with the way he handled our situation. Halfway through eating my salad I noticed a screw in my salad. I could not believe with such a classy establishment that a screw was in my salad. Although I was completely disgusted I understood that accidents can happen. With that said there should've been no questions asked that the entire meal should've been comped. Randy came to the table and I made it clear that this was unacceptable and our meal should be comped. Much to my surprise only half was comped. Randy came back to the table after hearing our concerns and was very patronizing. I explained to him that I could've choked on the screw or chipped a tooth and he said \"yeah but you didn't.\" I could not believe he said that not to mention the fact that it was a dirty screw in my food so who knows what kind of nasty bacteria was on it. We will never eat here again. What should've been a fun night celebrating Valentine's Day was left with us being extremely disappointed!!",

From the minute we sat down till the minute we left we were treated like their only customers. Steve went out of his way to describe in detail the complete menu for us and was one of the most attentive waiters we have ever had. There are absolutely no words to describe our meal. Never had we had prime rib cooked to perfection like we had at Fleming's. It just melted in your mouth. Was wonderful to have three difference sauces for dipping and the salads were huge.  So very happy we picked this restaurant and we look forward to many visits. We were even visited by Marc, the manager who was as professional as he could be. If I could give the customer service and meal a 10+ rating I would. Absolutely the best meal we have had in a very long time and the best prime rib we have ever had. We cannot wait to try out their wonderful steaks in our future visits. My husband even received a birthday card signed by the staff. What a nice touch. Our compliments to Marc and his fine staff for allowing us to have such a fantastic experience.",

When taking our dinner order, she failed to mention the specials. We found out about them after overhearing another server tell his table about them.  When we mentioned to her the many oversights on our service, she just kept saying the wine flights really confused her. Really?? You work at a wine bar!

The service was great by all the wait staff who worked together to stay on top of any needs.   Food wise we were delighted from the pre-meal bread to the very delicious steaks we both ordered. Flemings is certainly on par with all the other premier steakhouses my wife and I have experienced (Morton's, Ruth Chris, etc.)   Knowing it was our anniversary they were very nice and gave us a gift of a box of chocolates and a coupon for a future visit.   The only negative thing I can say, about this location anyway, is we went there for a romantic type dinner and there was a full bar with flat screens and football on. Trust me, I am a huge football fan, but I didn't like the negative effect it had on the ambiance of the whole restaurant. You can't have a fancy steakhouse and a sports bar. You can have a sports bar that makes a good steak, but you lose the feeling you're looking for when wanting a romantic night out.   We may come back here, but it won't be for an anniversary dinner.",

I got the truffle mashed potatoes and my husband the jalapeno mac and cheese. Both of our dinners were amazing!

We've been to Flemings in Tucson before and we didn't like the steak nor the service there. We've decided to try the one in Phoenix, it's totally different!  We walked in and got greeted and seated because it wasn't too busy. We came about an hour ish till closing time. Our waitress, Jennifer, was amazing and friendly. She was very attentive and she was very patience giving us time to look through the menu because we were indecisive of what to order.   We've decided to order the Burrata with Prosciutto for starters and a medium rare Tomahawk Steak to share.  The starter dish have the charred campari tomatoes, prosciutto, wild arugula, and toasted garlic crostini. It was a light appetizer and it goes well with wine. The tomahawk Steak cooked perfectly! We were afraid of their seasonings for the steak back in Tucson, which we think it was way to salty, but they made it perfectly here in Phoenix.   It was a great date night and I am very impress with the service and delicious dinner.",

For such a moderately fancy restaurant, we had such high expectations, but little did we know that our experience would be the exact opposite. At first glance, the restaurant looks wonderful, but the service on the other hand, is such a disappointment. We were uncomfortable and Fleming's left a bad taste in our mouths. We were treated Like outsiders and judged from The start. From The moment we walked, were seated, it was a complete disaster.we were not welcomed properly and absolutely not acknowledged for being there on such a special occasion. I never felt so relieved to finally pay the bill, get it over with, and leave. For our first date night in  about 6 MONTHS  (since I had a baby) I will never come back here again. I don't want a refund,or anything to do with this restaurant, I would just like to say, have more class. We will be sticking with Durant's, for they are a reputable steakhouse.  *Only giving 2 stars because my creme brulee was delicious & put a much needed smile on my face  *",

We have mostly dined here for special occasions but recently increasing our visits for regular date and dinner nights.  The last several times we've dined in the bar for Happy Hour, ordering from both the Happy Hour menu and the regular menu.   Most recently we tried the $50 filet and lobster special which comes with a salad and a desert.  Our filets and lobster were perfectly prepared.  We love the Fleming's salad with the lemon vinaigrette dressing.  For desert we gravitate to the lava cake or the berries & cream.    For special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries the staff provide cards and a special treat!",

The bartender knows how to make a righteous Long Island iced tea. Our filet mignons (mine a \"petit\") and side of mashed potatoes were fantastic.  Unfortunately, our side of asparagus was nearly inedible. The asparagus was pencil-thin and so stringy that our steak knives couldn't cut through the stems. That item should have been left off the menu for that evening. When you spend $160 (before tip) for a meal, everything should be perfect.  Having said that, it was very nice that we were given four delicious chocolate truffles for our anniversary.",

You have to start with the Ahi Tuna Poke (crazy good)  Their wine selection is a little expensive but very good.  It is nice that they bring out an iPad with all the selections so you can choose the appropriate wine for dinner.    This restaurant does an amazing job to accommodate and allergies and the chef will come to the table and ask what they have to do to make sure you have a great dining experience.",

I checked in my reservation and headed to the bar to enjoy some grey goose and cranberry. Its 4pm and it's dark and not busy at all at this time, which is really nice.  We were upstairs here and Bobby came on over and greeted us. She was very helpful in her recommendations, as well as, kept the drinks coming. I loved that she mentioned items from the local curated menu. I like when there's a bit of local items on any menu. That's a must!   Appetizer - I had the the beef flemingtons, which were filled with smoked cheddar cheese, mushroom duxelle, and Madeira sauce. So amazing and I can eat these by themselves. It's like a little pastry puff and so light and fluffy.   Main course - I ordered the 16oz prime New York strip, medium. It was almost like cutting into butter. That is how freaking tender this steak was. I had to add the Truffle poached lobster with a touch of bearnaise sauce and and drop of caviar. I've never had caviar before and it didn't live up to my expectations. But the lobster was so good and the sauce sent me over the moon. I can't have steak with out my mash potatoes, so I ordered the Yukon mash potatoes, which were whipped to perfection. Also, ordered the grilled high country asparagus because I feel better about myself when I have a vegetable at any meal. It kind makes me feel like I'm being an adult and making the right decisions in life lol.   All in all, you can't go wrong by choosing to go here. You're making the right choice! The atmosphere is relaxing and not filled with the hustle and bustle like many restaurants. When I dine out, I pay for service, as well as, the atmosphere and the quality of the food. This place is exceptional. If you're ever here request Bobby, she's amazing (not sure if I spelled her name right), and Alma the manager was so nice and hospitable. I will be back.",

Such a personable guy, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and the full wine list. We were never left wanting for anything.  The bread basket included a variety of rolls along with a cracker. I'm a bread snob because I bake my own bread, but all of the offerings were excellent.  We ordered the pork belly appetizer. It was served on a bed of grits, and a lovely savory glaze atop. Along with that, I had the blueberry lemon drop cocktail, which was sweet and perfect.  For our main dishes, my husband ordered the wagyu strip (a special offering for the month of December) while I had the petite filet mignon. We shared two vegetables sides: heirloom carrots and Brussel sprouts. Steve brought us several samples of red wine early on, and we agreed on a Duckhorn merlot, which paired perfectly with our food. Everything was delicious. So many restaurants cannot cook steak; Fleming's has mastered it.  We were too full for desert, but that menu looked incredible, too.",

The 3 course summer meal was delicious and the bone in rib eye was very tasty. Our server was by enough to make sure we were taken care of, but not too much to be bothersome. He came up with excellent suggestions and made my 7 year old feel special and that his opinion mattered. The only thing I would change is the dessert for the 3 course meal was supposed to be similar to a s'more, but really was a glorified chocolate pudding with a pinch of Graham crackers and a toasted marshmallow, for a restaurant of this caliber I expected a little more, but I still ate it as I like chocolate pudding.",

We haven't been here in a while, so we were looking forward to a very nice steak dinner, and we weren't disappointed.  To start, hubby got the chopped salad, and he loved the vinaigrette dressing on it.  I went with the lobster bisque, and it was amazing!!  The huge pieces of lobster were so tender, it was divine.  We both had the filet mignon, I got the herbed horseradish butter on it, and they were both melt-in-your-mouth perfect.  The seasoning was on point, and the knife literally slid through them, like they were going through butter.  As our sides, hubby chose the Fleming's potatoes (he loved them) and I got the rainbow carrots, which are slightly carmelized and cooked in garlic butter.  To end the meal, hubby got the key lime pie (which he orders wherever they have it) and they served it with a side of chantilly cream.  Our server was Megan, who was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.    I am really looking forward to our next special night out, so we can head back here again...everything was so delicious!!",

    "text": "Let me qualify this review, Flemings is our favorite steak house in San Diego.  There is little variation in quality of food or service, down town location to La Jolla.   The food was perfect at this AZ location.  Flawless and hot.  The wine is 4X market price, if you got one glass of wine, you paid Bevmo bottle price.  The service is not what we experience in other Flemings locations.  Our server, although he did accommodate our request, had a flat affect, and very slow service.  We weren't in a hurry, our service was not the quality that we are accustomed to.  When we spend nearly $500 for our meals, our service should include smile and personality.  We had neither.  We certainly will continue to go to our favorite Flemings restaurants in the locations that give us more than perfect dining experiences.   Probably not return to this location.  PS:  After giving this review more thought, it actually wasn't the waiters fault for our slow to no service.  Actually the Flemmings in San Diego have two servers, or a server and a helper on each table.  We've never felt over served, just attentive service.",

Our server Thomas was very friendly and extremely efficient. We ordered a Caesar to split before the meal and it was very tasty! Then we all ordered filets. All of the steaks came out perfectly cooked and extremely juicy. I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese as a side and that could have been a meal by itself. The presentation of the lobster Mac was awesome with the lobster tail as a decoration on the plate. I can't say enough on how positive our whole experience was and I can't wait to go back!

Service is typically great, and in the few instances where it wasn't stellar, we've always had the opportunity to tell a manager because one stops by every. single. time. you visit. (Love!) and they always do what they need to in order to make it right.   My ONLY complaint with Fleming's is that their mashed potatoes are terrrrrrrible. Their texture is like glue. Like - really bad. I mean, the cafeteria at my work has better mashed potatoes. Bad. It seems a bit sacrilegious for a steakhouse to have bad mashed potatoes, so this always makes me feel just a wee bit sad. I would encourage them to meet up with the J&G Steakhouse folks to see how they keep their mashed potatoes light, fluffy and buttery, and then this would be the absolute perfect steakhouse experience. :)",

Nothing extra, nothing fancy. We have been there enough that with tax and 20% tip the bill should come to maximum $30 for one (the burger is $15 I think--pricey visit, but hey! located middle of where we both are coming from).   Never had any problems with our bill till our last visit when I looked at my credit card and saw the visit was $56--which means a waiter/bartender tacked himself an extra big, fat tip of $25 on my card. Maybe it's cause I was using a black card and he foolishly thought I didn't go thru my receipts or maybe it's cause we are seniors and he assumes (like too many younger men) that we are old and doddery and would go thru credit card statements but I do.  Religiously.  My credit card company took off $25 off the bill, Flemings didn't dispute it nor did they attempt to contact me to find out why--but I know one thing:  we won't be going back to Fleming's ever again no matter where they are located.   See how you can ruin your reputation and business with greedy waiters and bartenders?  Same thing happened to my son recently at Carrabba's, also, but Capitol One credit card actually caught that huge added tip, called him and Carrabba's sent him a $25 credit for there.  We will be going back to Carrabba's--but Flemings?  Hell, NO!",

We chose to get an appetizer which was the BBQ shrimp which was amazing!! The sauce just melted in your mouth!! I got the taste of season entree and my date got a steak that he loved with a side of potatoes.  We had four different people stop by our table to make sure everything was ok. We overall had an amazing time and the food was great. The prices are up there but worth it. We want to check out the happy hour, it looked like a bunch of good deals.",

I'm the one that looked it up on Yelp and their Website, well...Let me tell you! As they say in Texas, big hat, no cattle . Our steak was horrendously salty, my wife had steak and lobster tail, she normally is very liberal with salt, she complained how salty it was... Very disappointed as I was celebrating my 60th birthday, I thought myself to wait a few days before posting a review, so I have an opportunity to cool off and don't come out with guns blasting. The reason that I gave it 2 stars is because the steak was tender and the ambiance was ok, the service was just ok. The fact that management would not even offer a birthday cake for the guy picking up the bill is appalling...after all the other people would also order something else...hello?! Anyway, I have learned that in business it's easier to keep a client than get a new one. I would insist in not going even if I was a guest, save you money and go some place else, they obviously don't have a qualified Chef in the kitchen.",

    "text": "I feel a bit snobby with this review but my experience was so-so with Fleming's. It wasn't awful, I just had expectations that they were unable to fulfill.    So why only 3 stars?  For starters the hostess wasn't that personable and barely looked at us.  We walked up and were immediately met with a very curt, \"Hello, do you have a reservation?\" We did have a reservation and were seated immediately.  Yes, I know it's a bit picky for me to point out but If I am spending $250 for dinner you better believe I feel I deserve a bit more eye contact and a smile.    They made sure to have a gluten free menu available for me and the fact they had their wine list on an ipad was kind of cool.  :)    Our waiter, Jeff, was very attentive and quite helpful.  He wasn't pushy but still made sure he was around enough to follow up with us throughout the night.  I guess the only \"coaching\" I would have for him was that he didn't remember I  could not have any of the food with wheat in it.  He proceeded to recommend the chocolate lava cake to us 2 times.  We told him after the first time it has wheat in it, no.  He asked again later on to which we reminded him that we could not and why.    The appetizer was good but it was obvious the sauce for the appetizer was reheated from a microwave.  The salad was great.  The steak- meh.  The only reason why it gets a \"meh\" is because it was not cooked right.  Seasoning was good, it was a great cut, they just didn't cook it to my specifications.  I asked for medium, I got medium rare.  I didn't say anything though because I was starving and ate most of it anyways, although I left quite a bit on my plate (a lot of the rare parts.)   The restaurant did feel very \"chain-y.\"  Like a glorified, expensive, Macaroni Grill but a steak house version.  But then again I knew what I was getting into when I suggested the place for Valentine's weekend.  I knew it was a chain, that some of the food would not be made from scratch and was reheated-microwaved-processed-at-a-central-kitchen food, but the reviews made me still want to give it a shot.   If you are really into chain restaurants (Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill, Claim Jumper, etc.) and wanted a higher end chain restaurant experience, then definitely check them out.  If you are more of a foodie and like a fine dining experience where other patrons get that fine dining attire is not jean-shorts, where dishes are fresh and from scratch, I suggest avoiding.",

Unfortunately for myself, I ordered the crispy pork belly which wasn't so crispy and it was 98% pure fat.  I guess I should have known that already, but it didn't even taste good.  I ended up leaving about a third of the dish on the plate.  My housemates, however, were smarter and ordered the burger which is also $6 and that looked delicious.  I had food envy all night.  Although I'm sure the burger was good, I'm still giving 2 stars because I think everything on their menu should be just as good.",

She wasn't wild about the potatoes but her steak was cooked to her preference. I would have liked to see some char and grill marks. I had the sirloin with the scallops. Steak was 5 oz and very good but the scallops were very disappointing as the 3 were about the size of a quarter, much smaller than the scallops I buy from Sams or Fry's. They appeared to be pan seared but had very little color. Service by our waitress only, seemed to be lacking but the rest of the staff picked up for her. All in all it was a pretty good dinner for $175 for the 2 of us. We don't do this often as our steaks over mesquite at home rock too",

It was a gorgeous mid-Feb evening, so the 3 of us passed on sitting in the inviting and tastefully decorated bar/dining area (busy but comfortable) and chose a table on the patio.    The wait staff welcomed us with with smiles, water, menus, and great home-made potato chips. Drinks were ordered and we perused the menu without feeling rushed. However,  the waitress was at the table in a jiffy to answer questions and when we were ready, take our order.    Dinner was divine!  We shared the delicious Heirloom tomato and beet salad and ordered rib eyes and filet mignon.  The steaks were wonderful: tender, and well-seasoned. And our sides, Fleming's potatoes and creamed spinach, were tasty and garnished nicely.    When coffee was ordered,  I off-hand mentioned to the waitress that we were celebrating my dad's 89th birthday.  So were surprised when the coffee was served with a complimentary mini-box of chocolate truffles - a perfect dessert for a perfectly memorable evening.  Fleming's is pricey but provides a good dining experience.  Our service was great and the dinner was delicious.  The ambiance is sophisticated but comfortable with an attention to detail that makes this chain restaurant a standout.  Finally, this Fleming's is conveniently located for those on the far west end of the Phoenix metro area who don't want the long drive to downtown Phoenix or Scottsdale.  Looking forward to dining at Fleming's again!",

We checked it out soon after it opened, and of course, it's a clone of their other location. Though the service wasn't quite as stellar, it was still very nice.   Being unemployed, and dining on someone else's ticket, I went cheap this time and got the cheapest entree on the menu -- the beef Flemington. It's basically a beef wellie.  Unfortunately, it arrived woefully overcooked. Our server graciously offered to have a new one made for me. The second one was also overdone, just not as badly. I was hungry, so I didn't say anything. Nonetheless, they took it off of our bill.   However, everything else was perfect. I will chalk up those couple of things as an off-day, or perhaps they hadn't quite ironed out the wrinkles yet. I'll need to check back after they've been open for a year or so.",

    "text": "This place gets one star because of the service expected for these prices and the service and food received. We had a dining credit through an email and a gift card given by flemings from a previous birthday visit. Called ahead to make sure that we could use both together. This was my first visit and my boyfriend's second. Will not be going back!! The waitress spent most at her time at the table next to us and was not very personable at all. I work in a restaurant, so I don't expect her to kiss my feet but at least try to be a little less cold when I am paying 40 for a steak (not including a side). Bad service can ruin the whole meal. Our drinks were often empty, the bread that they serve while the spreads are very good, you need superman strength to cut through the crust on the bottom (with a steak knife). I had the filet and salmon from the two course summer menu. My steak was tasty, but as soon as I got to the thicker part of my salmon, I could tell right away that it was undercooked. Let the waitress know and instead of letting me finish my steak, she took the whole plate and I sat there watching my boyfriend eat his steak. To make up for it the manager offered a free dessert, now who will make up for our server's crappy attitude????  When we tried to pay, our server informed us that we could not use two promotions together, and I told her that I called ahead of time. She had to check with the manager, came back to the table for the check and I asked what the manager said \"Oh I forgot to ask him, hold on\". Really it was a Monday night not busy at all. Manager said he would honor it this one time, I informed our server to tell the hostess about their policies. You are paying a champagne budget and getting Mcdonalds service. If you want better food and service for your money go to The Yard House in Westgate.",

    "text": "After my first visit on Valentine's day, I'm underwhelmed.  My wife has been to Flemming's so many times that she has literally ordered everything on the menu. It's one of her favorite restaurants, in no small part because steak is one of her favorite things.  After my last Valentine's day experience at Bella Luna, I have lowered my expectations for Valentine's day service. But why can't we just go to the Four Seasons every year? I digress.  So we made our reservation three or four weeks in advance and arrived a few minutes early. It took 10 - 15 minutes to be seated, which gave us time to walk around outside and take some self portraits in our dressy clothes.  They seated us in an awkward two-person table that is nestled in the corner of one of their half-walls.  Okay, time-out. If your restaurant has fewer than 5% of your tables in the tiny, two-person variety, then you shouldn't have them at all. Stop screwing us over! The table wasn't even large enough to lay a single closed menu on. Look, if you're one of those tiny French restaurants with only fuck-you tables, then fine. I'll chalk it up to French peculiarities. But when we are the only couple at a restaurant in a two person table, well, I start dropping stars and f-bombs.  Okay, so our server was pleasant, but the food and service came slow. At the end of the meal he gave us his business card and asked us to visit again. We also received a a $25 gift card for eating over V-day weekend, and received a thank-you e-mail the next day that I found to be a pleasant surprise.  The food was good, although I wish they had the V-day blue-cheese crusted fillet Mignon all the time, and not just on one day a year. Bread was nice, wine selection was good. No beer on tap, but I understand it's a steakhouse. Not much else to say, other than looking forward to using the $25 gift card on our next visit.",

    "text": "I received a $50 gift Cert from my work as a Christmas gift and I couldn't wait to try this place as I have heard good reviews from friends. My Girlfriend and I had a reservation for 6 pm, and it arrived about 5 minutes late, got stuck behind a stupid train near Grand... Grrr. but they had the table ready for as soon as we got there.  The Server was Awesome the whole night, There was another person assisting the waiter as well with refills and bread, he was also awesome. The bread & butter are AWESOME, they serve the freshly baked bread with 2 butters, if I remember right I think he said it was tomato butter and a feta butter, they were both SO good, I couldn't choose a winner, they are both great for different reasons.  We opted to get the Special they are running, the Sunday Prime Rib Dinner, it includes a Salad, Prime Rib with 1 side and a dessert, all for $29.99 a person. It was SUCH a good deal for this service level and quality of food. Normally just a steak at this place is $35-45 without anything else included.   My GF doesn't like salad too much so we asked if we could pay more and get a soup, and he said actually the French onion soup can be swapped at no extra charge, Or you can get the special soup of the day Lobster Bisque for an extra $5 , my GF ordered the French Onion, and I got the lobster Bisque. Both soups were AWESOME, there was a LOT of lobster in this soup, they don't skimp out. It was a great creamy soup, and the French onion was enjoyed very much by my GF, it had a LOT of cheese  on it, which she loves, it's her favorite part of course.  Within about 3 minutes of finishing the soup, the Prime Rib arrived, And we were both impressed with how big it was ! they don't hold back here ! it came with Au jus of course, and also a wonderful creamy horseradish sauce, and also a mustard horseradish sauce that was good, but I prefer the other one more.  We both ordered the Prime Rib to be cooked to Medium, and it was PERFECT medium. We both LOVED this Prime rib, it was fork, or even Spoon tender, really no need for a knife because the beef was so tender.  I ordered the Flemings Potatoes for my side, which are VERY thin sliced  potatoes layered with a cream sauce, cheese and jalapenos, but it's not spicy at all, just the flavor of the jalapenos, then it is topped with cheese and baked, it was AWESOME. My GF got the Garlic mashed potatoes, it was a bowl of Mashed Taters topped with a bunch of roasted garlic that you mix in, she loved them, I tried a bite and they were good also, just not as good as mine !  We both could not finish, I have probably at least half my Meat left, probably more than half and about 2/3 of the potatoes are left.   It came with Dessert also, they told us it came with a White Chocolate bread pudding, and my GF doesn't like bread pudding usually so he said she could replace with any of the other desserts and there was no charge for this. She opted for the Chocolate Lava Cake, but he told is will take about 20 minutes for that dessert, he asked if that was okay and we said yes. it actually took less time than that, it wasn't a long wait at all. The Bread pudding was INSANELY good, it wasn't super mushy like normal bread pudding, this was caramelized on the bottom of the bread portion, it was basically little dice sized cubes of bread, in a dome shape placed on top of a puddle of delicious creamy vanilla and white chocolate sauce, they also brought the table a bowl of Chantilly vanilla whipped cream, you KNOW that was good.  This is bread pudding for people who dont normally like bread pudding. If you try a bite of this, and you DONT like it, there is something wrong with you ! My Lady enjoyed her Chocolate Lava cake, it was much larger than mine, it came with the cake, a big scoop of ice cream in an awesome little crisp type of sugar cookie, and also a little pot of chocolate sauce, she loved it and was very happy with it.  I tried hers as well, I also liked it but I liked mine a little bit better.   I don't drink Alcohol at all, and my Gf didn't feel like drinking so it was Mango Iced tea for both of us, and they never let it get empty.    Over all it was pretty much the perfect dining experience, I couldn't even say one thing that went bad or that we didn't enjoy. It was my first time, but clearly won't be my last ! and to make sure of that, on the receipt they gave us an offer, if we go to their website and tell them how the experience was, they will give us a $25 dining credit for our next reservation there. So we will be back FOR SURE ! and Hopefully SOON !  Next time the Bone in Rib eye is all mine !",

The exterior of Flemings is nice although not all that impressive but the interior is very nicely done with deep warm colors that contrast with the white table settings. Everything ordered was excellent. The BBQ shrimp appetizer was tasty prepared with top quality shrimp. The NY strip was easily one of the best steaks I have had the pleasure of eating. The mushrooms and garlic mash were excellent companions as well. We closed with creme brulee with Chantilly whip and a glass of desert wine. The total was just under $200 including tip, my wife's filet and two cocktails. The service was also excellent. All considered I was happy with what I received for the money. I will be back.",

The wine list is on an iPad at the table, and show recommended food pairings.  We shared carrot cake for dessert - so wonderful!

    "text": "My husband and I checked out Flemings for happy hour on Friday night before going to see \"Book of Eli\". It was pretty busy that evening (the line was out the door when we left at 7:30), but our service at the bar was fine and we didn't have to wait long for our drinks or food. The only negative about how busy Flemings was the evening was that people were seat hawking around the bar, which is a tad annoying.  The happy hour deal at Flemings is \"5 for $6 until 7\". You can pick from five martinis, 5 wines by the glass, and 5 appetizers. The food is really where you are getting the deal. For drinks, there are a hundred happy hours in the Valley with better drink deals. My husband's Fat Tire beer was also $6 which is a ripoff since he gets it cheaper at other bars that we have been to. I did try two of the martinis on the happy hour list - the Margatini and Tropical Breeze. I'll admit that I like the \"girly\" martinis over classic ones, so both of the ones I had at Flemings were right up my alley and I really enjoyed them. We ordered three of the appetizers from the happy hour list - the calamari, crab cakes, and shrimp. The calamari was decent, but it actually needed salt because it was pretty bland. Also, it needed more of the sweet chili sauce as there was practically none on any of the pieces. I didn't try the shrimp, but my husband said they were fine. Nothing to write home about, but not bad. The crab cakes were definitely the highlight of the evening - by far the best crab cakes I have had in the Valley. They were practically perfection.   3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down to three because the happy hour deal is good for food (not so much for drinks) and nothing I tried aside from the crab cakes makes me want to have a full dinner at Flemings.",

We felt like such VIPs!  The decor and ambiance is very fancy, yet understated.  The service was great and the food was amazing!  Our hosts had already chosen a set menu for us, although we were able to choose our entree from a list of three. I chose the petite filet mignon. Tender, juicy, flavorful steak. It was fantastic. We were also served creamed spinach and parmesan and peppercorn mashed potatoes. Everything was scrumptious and cooked to perfection.  The cheesecake dessert was hands down the best part of dinner. I had to physically force myself to stop eating it. It had a crisp graham cracker crust, fresh blueberry sauce, rich cream cheese filling, and white chocolate shavings. Amazing!  As a starving grad student, this restaurant is a little bit rich for my blood, but I'd surely come back for a special occasion. 5 stars.",

    "text": "My wife and I looked forward to dinner here, thanks to restaurant week.  She had never been to Flemings, we normally go to Capital Grille or Donovans.   The evenings started off problematic, as this looks like no high-end steakhouse.  The tables were densely packed (too many tables) and there was a dull roar to the main dining room, and the side rooms were no better.  The service.  The waitress took our order, two filet mignons medium rare, sides for me spinach and greenbeans, the wife potatoes and greenbeans.  A bottle of Titus Vinyards Andronicus to go with.  She asked if we would like the bottle decanted, which of course we said yes, expecting her to come back with it and open it.  Nope, first she brought the wrong bottle of wine.  Second she didn't bring the bottle until after our salads.  The entree comes out and the runner informs us of one medium rare filet and one medium. Huh?  And the sides are identical, spinach and greenbeans.  After this correction we eat, it's just OK. (I am sitting down to a Fry's filet as I write this and it's better).  We finish our  entrees and are looking forward to the desert (which we ordered at the start), but it took her 20 minutes to bring out.  Very disappointing evening, we won't be going back.",

Nice decor, not really a place I'd take my toddler to but it was date night after all and the kiddo was at home - yippee!    But I digress.  I don't know much about wine but it looked like a pretty large selection and you can go through them either on the menu or on the iPad.  Way cool.    We both got rib eye - the hubby with bone mine without - his rare, mine medium well and he said that his was perfection. Mine was, too.    It didn't come with any sides so we shared a side of mashed potatoes.  The only thing I'd dock them a few points for is the food is really expensive.  I guess I can understand why my rib eye was almost $50 but $10 for a side of mashed potatoes?  Eeesh.  You can't go wrong getting a badass piece of juicy mouth watering steak here but I don't think I would come here for a while.  A $165 meal is probably something we do once every several years.  See you again in a few more years Flemings.  It was nice meeting you!  (It was our first time coming here)",

    "text": "Went here for a Friday happy hour. Go early, because it gets busy! We first started off in the bar, at a rather high table. I asked about a lower table, but was told happy hour is just in the bar. (The booths were all taken). After more people arrived, they opened up seating in a room off of the large dinning room. Our waitress was kind enough to offer us a table in that room. (Why not seat people there to begin with, if the bar is full, and someone is more comfortable with a lower table. My Mom at 5 feet tall, does not do well on high bar stools.) Now in nice comfy chairs!   So was not able to find a happy hour menu anywhere. Not on line, even stopped by to pick up a menu, but they do not give out \"Happy Hour\" menus. Gladly give you a copy of their main menu. Really??  Two different happy hours, think the hours were 5-7. Certain items on that menu, and 8-10. Not 100% sure on the times. We were at the early one, ordered calamari, which was very good. A type of spreadable cheese, and toasted bread. We also ordered lobster wraps, but paid regular price for them, since they are featured on the later happy hour. Price difference was just a few dollars. They were good, but I don't think I would order them again. They featured burgers on both happy hours. They were very, very good. Done perfectly. Order medium, get medium! Choice of three different cheeses, and lettuce, tomatoes, and onion on the side. Reasonable prices. Birthday celebration, was given a box of truffles with a candle. Very nice gesture! Wait staff was nice, especially tentative at filling water glasses!  It seems quite a few people enjoy dinning in this establishment, when we were leaving the dinning room was getting pretty busy.",

    "text": "Amazing experience. We wanted something special for our 5 year anniversary and this was exactly that! Food was beyond good, and service was above par. From the moment we walked in we were addressed by name and congratulated, to the anniversary card on the table after being seated, to the server addressing us by name. Food and service weren't rushed, which I loved as it gave us time to enjoy the evening. The manager Marc came by, addressed us by name and gave us a gift card for next time in congratulations. The server came over with a camera and took a picture, which we got in a frame with a box of truffles to take home. Such a small gesture and so thoughtful to commemorate something special to us. As we walked out the hostess once again addressed us by name and congratulated us. If you are look for upscale, white table cloth, dining, this is the place to go! We will be back :)",

    "text": "One of the best steak dinners I've had in the Phoenix metro area. I appreciate attention to detail and this location did a great job of that. All of our food and drinks were delicious and well prepared. I loved the touches that were included: the drawn butter for my lobster, the chantilly cream with our creme brulee, and the decanter with the martinis. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because there were people in the restaurant wearing baseball caps on a Friday night eating dinner. I definitely don't expect to see that when having a $300 meal on date night.",

Thankfully we did have a res and a booth, as requested in the reservation.  Nice a la carte selections but the wine list was seriously lacking.  Lots of blends and over priced bottles but nothing that struck our fancy.  I settled on a Toso Malbec that was nice.  We both order starters, steaks and sides.   I sent back the lobster bisque. It tasted like starchy baby food.  Worse ever and at $14 for a little cup of it, it was surely going back.  Steaks were cooked perfectly but were unremarkable. The 'generous portion of king crab' atop my steak was a joke for the $14 additional price tag.  It was good but laughable after I specifically asked the waitress about the portion. I really wanted crab with my steak. It was just one bite worth of crab.    We enjoyed the wine, steaks and the Fleming's potatoes.  The bill was about $250 with tip and the waitress brought a box of truffles as a thank you for dining with them on Valentine's Day.   This is supposed to be a high-end steak house and we just didn't get it.  We've had so much better overall elsewhere.  I really wanted to like it but it feel short. I see where they pay attention to detail, push desserts and try to make you feel special but the food quality just wasn't there.",

    "text": "So here is our story. Booked reservation online, arrived 45 early to have cocktail prior to dinner. Checked in with hostess to advise we would wait for reservations. Meanwhile line was forming. We drank our bottle of wine and beers while waiting for booth. We watched from bar area while several parties were served. We questioned the hostess as to why we continued to sit at bar while walk ins were being served. We were told that because we wanted a booth they were waiting on table to open. Note that almost an hour pasted we still had not been seated to our reservation. Finally I asked my fiancee to inquire. The hostest clearly had let our table(s) go.  We were seated about 10 mins after that in the floor area at at a table, when we were told previously our wait was because of a reservation for a booth, mind you several walk ins were seated prior to us. Okay meal time ( as reservation and dress don't mean anything here) we were presented with food for that was not indented for outnumbered table (calamary and pasta mushroom pasta) we explained we did not order and we don't eat bread (pasta/breading). The server simply left the order anyways because the manager wanted to make things right. So food Sat there unate. Finally we order our meal. We explained to server our issues with seating and food. He apologized and brought salad. While we waited for food. We  ordered steak and brussels (shared side). The steak was great the side was small and the bill was outrageous. Long story short. We dressed for this destination, made reservations for booth, arrived early. We did everything right and they did everything wrong. Not recommend for date night left upset and feeling discriminated. Not a good look Flemmings.",

They must have seated every walk up first as we waited 20 minutes for a table. Then when our steaks arrived they were all mixed up and none of the 4 of us got what we ordered cook temp wise. Seems the waiter Steve and the food delivery guys were not on the same page. His response was \"I cant do everything\". At least the manager voluntarily came by and comped our bottle of mid priced wine. When you have both food and service issues 3 stars is pretty good.",

My whiskey old fashioned was also top notch.   Service- was typical for a steakhouse. However there were some very nice  touches that made our visit more special. When we made a reservation they asked of we were celebrating anything and my wife mentioned that it was our anniversary.  There was a card at our table when we arrived signed by some of the management.  The manager also came by and gave us a $25 gift card for our next visit, and the server gave us a box or truffles on the way out.   Location- Outside of the main city but very nice building, plenty of parking, and right next to a cigar shop.  I skipped desert and got myself a fine hand rolled Nicaraguan cigar infused with honey.  Yes please!  Price- For Arizona I thought this place was a pricey, especially since its in the suburbs, however we had an excellent experience. There also isn't much competition at their location so they can charge a bit more since they probably aren't as busy as other steakhouses.",

The decor and atompshere is there but just not the same.  Looks like it, doesn't feel like it.  We were greeted immedately and seated as our reserved table for 6 (Saturday night - before Mother's day).  The wine list was fancy (electronic tablet).    Our server was just NOT attentive at ALL and made the experience basically SUCK. -She never mentioned the specials for the day (the list on laying on the table, someone discovered it later) -She brought the wrong beverage -She has to come back to ask was we ordered because she couldn't read her handwriting -Never was around to grab her attention  Now to the food, two of our group stressed that they needed they meats cooked well done.  One of the filet mignons was to be butterflied to make sure it is well done and the other sliced filet migon was to be well done.  Well, the ladies got their filets and they are still oozing blood.  Come on a butterflied filet migon and a SLICED filet migon not well done?  Really???  Especially on the sliced one, when you slice it and see blood and pink = NOT well done.  We had to send the 2 plates back.  The guest of honor had to sit was watch some of start to eat.  Don't get me wrong, my steak was perfect and tasted great.  You are a steakhouse, getting steaks cooked to the right temperature is your forte!    I am surprised that a Manager was not send out to appoloize or at least talk to the table when we had to send back 2 of the 6 main entrees.  He came by at the end to do a quick hello and how was everything...  Well, it sucked but nothing you can do now at this point!",

We waited in the bar for few minutes, it was like they wanted us to just sit there and not be seated in the dining room area.  Th food was ok but amazing like your other steak houses. The service was not excellent the waiter tried to up-sale  the wine list even though we knew our wines. After insisting on what we wanted he backed off.  We did have a bug in one of our wine glasses and told the waiter he didn't even apologize. He just walked away and got us another glass.  When the food was being served as they placed the plates down my mother grabbed her plate and burned her hands that she had to place her hands around the water glass. No apology even from the manager who placed her plate down just a \" be careful the plates are hot\" and walked away.",

As I laid there trying to grasp what had just happened to me the girl at the reception desk just stared at me and as she standing there holding the menus instead of rushing to help me up she proceeds to tell me \"oh well believe it or not this happens a lot\". As I gathered myself she leads us to the table to sit down, you would think she would then inform a manager of the situation but instead she doesn't bother saying a word.  Once my waitress came over and asked how my evening was with no clue well you can imagine how angry I felt then. I explained how their first impression was not that great. Having a reservation didn't matter we still had to wait and now this happening well you can imagine. Once informed SHE did  let a manager know what had happened. Which then of course the manager Alma tried to play off that no nothing like this has ever happened before she didn't know why the receptionist would say anything like that. Etc.  Tried to see if I needed medical attention and she would write an incident report.  Needless to say dinner wasn't all that enjoyable seeing as I was in pain. They comped my meal trying to make amends. The next day I woke up w a stiff neck a sore thigh and a banged knee. In the following days I ended up at the chiropractor needing an adjustment and will need to be going for the next couple of weeks to help with the stiffness.  And a nasty bruised   I finally got a call back from the \"adjustor\" from corporate which she then informed me that they have \"no med pay\" policy and it's a third party agency if I want to file a claim and \"MAYBE\" get money reimbursed for the chiropractor other wise I could inform her of the cost and maybe she could issue me some \"gift cards \" for the inconvenience. Right. Cause I really am anxious to go back to that place.   Basically they don't admit anything wrong had happened. I called the restaurant and spoke to a manager named Chase. And asked if something was being done so that this doesn't happen to someone else and if it had happened before why wasn't it taken care of before. He did admit it had happened before and that Now they were looking into putting a rug.  But who knows if that's True or not. Not really willing to go look for my self.  So be careful don't find yourself in the same situation. Note: I was wearing heels. Yes, I do know how to walk in them. NO I was not drinking. And Nothing was spilled on the floor.",

We were warmly greeted at the door and shown to a lovely table. Our greeter asked if we preferred the white table cloth or if we would prefer a black table cloth. She showed us the tablet with the various wine lists and shared our waiter's name. Daniel came by shortly and was extremely friendly and helpful with suggestions. He shared with us the additional specials offered that evening. I selected the sliced filet with lobster cakes. My husband chose the 12 oz. filet with the porcini mushroom rub. Both steaks were cooked to perfection with amazing flavor. We had selected the signature potato side which was perfect for sharing. Our meal was preceded by an amazing warm bread loaf with a variety of cheese spreads. Extremely delicious! My husband also raved about the salad he ordered. I saved space for the creme brulee which was perfectly prepared with fresh fruit and whipped cream. The meal was very pricey at over $200 when you added wine/drinks but the experience and quality was well worth the price paid. Certainly an \"occasion\" restaurant. We were pleased to learn that there were other \"Fleming's\" across the country and nearby our hometown in Tampa, FL, as well! An unforgettable evening! Thank you so very much!",

I was put off as soon as we walked in.....The bar area had loud music and a fricken TV on. Now when I go to a restaurant, especially when you pay $50 for a piece of meat, I expect QUIET. Folks were dressed as though they just got off the milk wagon.... I had the 14 ounce ribeye which was nothing to get excited about. The French onion soup was salty but digestible. The bread came with two types of butter which were good. One was made with parmesan cheese and the other with bacon. The mashed potatoes were no different from what I make at home. The presentation of my plate with just the meat, could have been better. They don't have gingerale but they can make it with Sprite and bitters! Uhm? My husband had the spinach salad which I thought was oily. It came with a deep fried something or other, I asked my husband what did it tasted like, he responded \"like you don't want to try it\" Uhm? He had the surf and turf, he liked it. The shrimp had a very light batter, which was good.The sauce over the sliced beef was strange to me. Service was good. Since it was our anniversary, they gave us two boxes of truffles, which was nice but again strange to the taste,  and a waxy texture. I don't understand why folks like this place. I suppose if you can't cook, this would be amazing. I will not be returning.",

It was all so amazing we couldn't wait to go back. After last nights visit which would be our 3rd, the chances of us returning are slim. The order's continue to get messed up and still served and the service was just terrible. We had to ask to clean our plates away as the served our dessert....Really? Our waitress was clearly preoccupied with friends. What was just a short time ago an A+ restaurant has now dropped to a D. Spending $200.00 on average for dinner I seriously expect much better.  So disappointed",

The service was stellar never an empty glass. There was a person for a different service which was nice for example one person came to refill your water etc. another to bring your food another to add sherry to your soup and of course your waiter who made sure you had everything and remove any plate that was in your way or not being needed. Even the supervisor came to greet you to make sure everything was exceptional. The price is steep but for good reason the food quality is above and beyond just like the service.  We spent around $215 including tip for those of you wondering about price range that didn't include wine. Do yourselves a favor and at least try it once you won't be disappointed. I always ask myself this question once I try a new place. \"Would I go here again?\"  The answer is yes.",

The ambiance:  typical steak house wood and leather.  Pretty and warm.    The service:  Our server was very good. Once or twice we kind of felt like we had been forgotten and our server admitted that she thought we had been taken care of, but generally it was really good.  The food:  We got the special which was a filet and vegetables.  We ordered some extra mashed potatoes on the side.  I have to say that I have had better steak.  It was not as tender as I would have expected and the flavor was seriously lacking.  My brother asked me halfway through the meal what I thought and, being tactful and not wanting to make him feel that this wasn't such a great choice, I pointed out the positives.  He said he was underwhelmed. Gotta say that we both pretty much thought we had much higher expectations for the price point and the reputation.  I have been to other Fleming's and felt I had better food.  The vegetables and potatoes were good but not fabulous.    Fleming's, you didn't wow me on this trip.  Maybe next time...",

I had the 8-ounce filet pan seared and hubby upgraded to the 12 ounce filet for only $5 extra his was $55. Server removed the lobster tail from the shell for me, it was cooked well and served with a grilled half lemon and hot butter yumm! all that and the bread and the nice bottle of Pinot Grigio, we definitely skipped on the desert.

Instead, we received steak and shrimp...minus the lobster tail (which another member of our group would have gladly consumed)...have no fear though, we were charged full price for the steak and lobster (which we did not get), plus an up charge for the shrimp thus saving the restaurant money, but not me. An additional side included Brussels sprouts, which were way undercooked and poorly seasoned. Desserts were average at best. Like I said, steak was good, but not much else.",

Had the chipotle mac & cheese as a side and it was something Bobby Flay would be proud of, just the right amount of spice in a great comfort dish.

The wine list is on and iPad and extensive. If your not electronic savvy they also have the list printed. The wine in my opinion is overpriced, slightly. I wouldn't say however it's excessive so don't feel like you're getting ripped off. I usually start with their clam chowder, which I did this time as well. Big pieces of clams were good to see and taste! I also decided to get their boneless New York Strip - Dry Aged vs a Filet Mignon which I have had numerous times and have never been disappointed. The splurge for the dry aged cut was worth it. It was gigantic and cooked to my perfection. For $57, I would recommend that if dining as a couple, cutting it in half and sharing it. I would have been plenty for two, especially after you have at that point gorged on a starter or two, bread, and their sides!! Lastly if you don't already, sign up with Open Table to ensure you make a reservation. They get busy fast, with the busiest time always seeming to be around 7pm.",

Tonight was probably the last time we will be there. They are very aware their happy hour is one of the busiest times they have yet the seating area is very limited. In the past I have seen them open up the back area to seating. We received a gift card from the management for a less-than-stellar experience on our last occasion and tonight they would not accept that card and made us wait in the waiting area for an open table which never occurred. The less than Stellar experience occurred during a wine pairing which the food was not only cold but the wine was late on every course. Two hours after leaving we received a phone call asking if we had paid our bill. This is just atrocious and I believe we are finally finished with trying to trust that Fleming's will improve on these experiences. Very very very poor management and chef experience. By the way the dining room was empty except for about 3 tables. I don't know if it is a management issue however whoever is running the restaurant certainly does not know what it is they are doing.",

Their burgers are to die for! All kinds of burgers besides ground beef...they have portabella mushroom, crab cake and a prime rib burger! The rolls just melt in your mouth.   The regular menu has a wonderful selection. The steaks are beyond good, and they always have a nice selection of seafood. The side dishes are awesome. We have tried almost all the sides and keep finding new favorites! You have to try the Flemming's potatoes, and the mushrooms, yummy! I got the Sea bass the last time I went and the waiter said it was swimming off the coast of California the day before! It was very good! My husband got the cajun spiced ribeye which was excellent as usual. There is a good prix fix menu too, that changes with the seasons.  Definitely save room for the dessert. They have a great Chocolate lava cake that they serve with ice cream. I take some of my dinner home (they box it up so nice) so I can still eat dessert.  A great place for a nice dinner or a special occasion.  Go on line and make a reservation and sometimes you can get a deal.",

    "text": "Flemmings is a fancier steakhouse chain. I would say its somewhere in between The Keg and Carvers. We arrived around 5pm Sunday with no reservations and were promptly seated. They have a huge wine selection and a small wine cellar. There are cherry wood walls from floor to ceiling. The overall look is an elegant steakhouse. I'm not sure if it was because it was Sunday, the proximity of Sun City, the time of day, or that only older folks still have money stashed away but I would have to guess the average age was somewhere around 63 up in there. Not that that has any weight on the review or I'm anti aging but it was just a mere observation.   They brought out some fresh baked rosemary bread and two different kinds of butter right after we sat down. The bread was awesome. Hot and soft inside and a slightly crunchy outside. One butter was whipped and the other was more of a spread. They both were good. I know its just bread but it was very tasty.   Most everything on the menu is ala carte. The steaks ranged from 30-50 bucks, the sides were from 7 and up and salads about the same. There were a couple of prix fixe summer options but neither looked very enticing. However, on Sundays they have a prime rib option. You get to choose a salad, side, prime rib, and a dessert for around 27 dollars. We both decided to go try it out.   My caesar salad came out first. The salad was a good size. The dressing was flavorful. Not overbearing and not non existent either. However, much of the lettuce was yellow/not good. My wife had the same thoughts on hers. The croutons they had in that salad could seriously break some teeth. Our first thought was for as fancy and ballerific this place shoots for they should hit you with a bomb salad from the jump. Without a doubt the salads were the worst part of the entire dinner.   Not long after we received our meals. We were served some nice thick slices of prime rib with three dipping sauces. The prime rib was cooked to perfection. There was a aus jus sauce, a horseradish sauce, and I can not remember the third. I would have liked the horseradish sauce to be stronger and the aus jus to have more flavor but all three were ok. The meat had a good amount of fat on it which is typical for prime rib. It also had a nice char on the edges. I ordered mash potatoes with blue cheese. They basically threw in a huge chunk of blue cheese that was soft and melting in the middle of the potatoes. It was simple and awesome. My wife enjoyed her meal as well. She commented on the fat ratio of the meat and wished she would have ordered it a bit more rare.   For dessert I ordered the lava chocolate cake. The waitress gave me a heads up that it took 20 minutes before we ordered so I could put it in earlier. The dessert looked awesome. There was a fortune cookie type boat filled with vanilla ice cream standing next to a chocolate cake with mint and a raspberry on top with a side of cream. As I cut into the chocolate cake there was an oozing of hot melting dark chocolate pouring out of the side. The flavor of the hot chocolate, mixed with the soft hot chocolate cake, and ice cream all together was mouth watering goodness. It was so large the wife and I shared it and took her cheesecake to go.   The service was also on par. The server kept never let our glasses go empty, the waitress was informative, and the manager came by to ask us how everything was.   I can't comment on the value of anything except for what we had and for a prime rib dinner like that under 30 bucks was definitely a value. I was so full I just wanted to take a nap right there at the table. So if you are looking for a nice Sunday meal and in the mood for some prime rib I would have to recommend giving Flemmings a go.",

Rather than acting inconvenienced, they were very pleasant as they seated us without wait. With their extensive wine list, presented both in a menu form and on an iPad and with the broad menu, it took some time to make decisions. While deciding we enjoyed our cocktails with their house bread, hot from the oven with several custom butters.   We started by sharing a Tenderloin Carpaccio that was perfect. We had the Caesar salad that was nice and crisp and very tasty followed by our entres.   My friend had the lamb which she was very happy with. My rib eye, is one of their signature dishes and I know why. Because they have perfected it. All their steaks are hand cut and wet aged. It came to the table right from the grill, nice and hot. The flavor was exquisite and it melted in your mouth. We had the Fleming s famous potatoes as a side dish that was more than large enough for two. Sadly we didn't get to try their desserts...we failed to plan ahead and overindulged before we got there.   I would have to consider Fleming's to be one of the TOP steakhouses in the Phoenix area in every respect. The ambience was great, the staff were obviously well trained and seemed to actually enjoy their work, and of course the food quality would be hard for anyone to beat.",

This place is a steak house and an expensive one, not the kind of place you just walk over too unless you don't care about spending 200 dollars on one meal. The steak was good. But everything is al carte meaning you have to order a steak and any sides separately. I usually don't like that and this place was not the exception. Maybe it was how we were introduced to this restaurant so I'll have to update when we actually plan to come here as part of a special occasion.",

If you dont like what they serve you tell them. they take great care of their customers. My husband and I went there for our Anniversary and they treated us like royalty. We did go to Costco and got the gift cards at a discounted price. Every bit helps. As we were leaving they took our picture then put it in a cute frame and gave us a Anniversary card and A box of truffles. Seriously who does that? Flemming's did. They have a customer for life with my family",

The food was excellent, service was superb, and the ambiance was one of the nicest I have experienced since leaving Southern California.  They made sure to honor my birthday with a card, present, and chocolates.  The manager stopped by to give his personal birthday wishes, as well as to check on our dining experience.  They are top notch all the way.",

My wife and I along with her cousin and his wife headed out to Fleming's on Sunday night since Sunday is the only night that they serve prime rib.  $36.99 get's you a generous cut portion of prime rib, a starter salad, a side, and a dessert.  A smoking deal considering how things can add up here if you order Ala-cart.  The dinning experience was spread out over about a two hour period starting with some bread and wine.  The waiter was very knowledgeable about the wine selections (there is an extensive wine list)  and tentative to our needs. The Riesling that my wife selected (per the waiters recommendation) was perfect for her taste.  The tomato basil spread along with the wiped butter for the bread was very delightful and a great way to start off the meal.  We all ordered the prime rib and a different side so we could each sample the different side dishes.    I started with the wedge salad with blue cheese dressing.  The lettuce was fresh and crisp and the blue cheese dressing was creamy.  I really enjoyed it.  A little while later they brought out our prime rim meals with our side dishes, the prime rib is cut about 1-1/4\" thick.  The prime rib came with three side sauces.  One was aju, another was creamy horse radish, and the last was a ground mustard sauce.   The three sauces were ok but I like straight horse radish with my prime rib, so I requested some and the brought it out.   For the sides I got the mac & cheese, my wife got the Fleming mash potatoes, her cousin ordered the grilled asparagus, and his wife got the onion rings.  WARNING!!!!!  The side dishes are HUGE.....  The onion rings were stacked about 12 inches tall, the mac & cheese was a large bowl, the Fleming potatoes could have been a meal on there own and there was enough asparagus to share.  Every thing tasted great.  The dessert's were great, chocolate lava cake, creme Brulee, and carrot cake.  All tasted fantastic.  So by now I am sure you are wondering why only 4 stars.  Well there was a couple small pieces of bone that I bit into on my first bite of the prime rib and I had to spit them out.  My wife also had the same thing in hers.  Also as a Prime rib the eye (the center of the prime rib) was though and a little chewy.  Not what I expect with a prime cut of meat.",
