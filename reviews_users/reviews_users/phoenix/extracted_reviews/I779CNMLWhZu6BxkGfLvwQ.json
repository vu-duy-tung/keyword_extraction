Menu said $1 off house wine for happy hour so I chose the $8/glass Pinot Noir. Server said they were updating their wine list and no longer carried my first choice. So we then chose the $10/glass of Pinot. The server then returned and said they were out of it. All that was left was the $12/glass. Now you'd think by now they'd at least offer the $12 glass at a lower cost. Nope. It was just a turn off. Either update your menu or monitor your inventory. $24 for 2 glasses of wine isn't happy hour in my book. We didn't get the $1 off either because apparently this was a premium wine. I did mention my issue to the server AND the hostess but don't think either of them cared to consult with a manager. Not sure we'll be back.",

I ordered the cioppino per the waitress recommendation. We also order sushi, fish tacos and clam chowder. Seems like we waited forever for our food and the waitress didn't refill our drinks at all the whole time we were there. We got our 2 sushi rolls, but there was a bug on the top. They took it back and remade another roll for us. We weren't too impressed by the food except for the fish tacos and chowder. My cioppino was bland and tasted like tomato broth with seafood pieces. Another thing the waitress didn't tell me it was $28 for a bowl. I tried to finish as much of it although it was flavorless since I paid so much! Probably wouldn't eat here again.

I thought we'd love the veggies, because..well it sounds awesome and it was pretty darn good except the larger brussel sprouts were almost raw. Oh and for the bar not being crowded, service was not stellar. One more thing I hesitate to mention, is I heard a waitress say, (while picking up drinks) \"is there a bug in there?\" Ugh I wish I hadn't heard that.

We both started with the Jalapeno Cilantro Margaritas and they had such a good spicy flavor and I'm picky with my margs! Second we got a dozen oysters... they came with an Asian sauce that took them over the top and really made them unique! Next I ordered a Tempernillo Wine  and my husband got The Smokin fin cocktail with makers mark that they lit on fire along with candied bacon!! Definitely order this drink because it was so good and definitely a sipper cause it packed a punch;) Next the 6 Spice Ahi with fried rice and spinach! And the big finale... Bourbon Caramel Bread Pudding! Wow!!! We had to get rolled out of there! Everyone was so sweet and they really took care us! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!",

Good lord, this place has everything! sushi, mexican, american, and really good drinks! We came for happy hour so I ordered an icetini. I think it was the strawberry one. The concept for this glass is nothing like you've seen. So they pour your drink in a piece of ice that's shaped to fit in the glass. So you're drinking your drink out of a piece of ice. It's a good concept because it keeps your drink nice and cool, however, since the ice melts, it drips everywhere when you're trying to drink it. lol.   For food, we ordered the lettuce wraps, calamari, and kickin shrimp. Everything was delicious! the shrimp was a bit spicy but it's still really good.   Customer service was also really great, they have a cute outdoor patio. They have happy hour every day I believe. all day on Sunday!",

    "text": "Smoke: Check Fins: Check  Smokin' hot quality? Ehhhh   My experience in three words: Crash and burn.  My experience in more detail:  Smokin Fins serves grilled meats, seafood, as well as salads, bowls, tacos and soup/stews. The restaurant itself is really large and has a contemporary warm feel to it. We were in the area and decided to dine here since it had been on my bookmarks list.  We started with the lobster tater tots. For close to $10 we got 4 thumb-sized breaded \"tots\" which were more like croquettes since it consisted of mainly mashed potato with a bit of shredded potato in the mix. I didn't really taste nor discern any lobster flavor nor see any noticeable lobster meat and it was really super salty for my tastes.   For the entrees I went for the cioppino because you don't see it on menus very often and because it had the \"SF\" symbol meaning that it was a favorite. Not to be overly suspicious, but my first thought when I saw that symbol next to the price tag was, is it a self proclaimed \"favorite\" because it is the most expensive seafood menu item on the menu? I figured I'd roll the dice, take my chances and see if the cioppino lived up to its status!  I probably should have known better than to get a San Francisco signature dish in Arizona. When it came out I was initially really impressed with the presentation since they included a half portion of snow crab legs in the \"stew.\" However, those thoughts soon went up in smoke as the entire dish itself was really disappointing. I'll even venture to say I really hated this dish. The plus was that there was a lot of variety in the cioppino: shrimp, clams, mussels, fish, and crab legs. However, the mussels were super tiny and the clams were not cleaned well at all. The sandy grittiness permeated throughout each clam and the more I ate the more the clams dispersed the grittiness into the surrounding stew, causing all the seafood to become gritty as well. You could say it tasted like the beach for I felt like I was eating tomato infused sand. One BIG no no was that they served me clams that were completely closed and could have been very dangerous to eat for anyone not in the know about seafood safety. The fish had bones in it and was served with the skin on. I don't enjoy eating rubbery fish skin if it's been put in a stew but that's my own preference. The crab legs themselves were so salty I couldn't actually taste the natural sweet flavor of the crab. The best seafood out of the whole mix were the shrimp but due to the sand in the dish they were gritty when I bit into them.   I also really didn't like the actual stew the cioppino was in. Cioppino is normally more broth-like. This felt like I was eating a bunch of canned stewed tomatoes or eating a chunky marinara sauce.  The cioppino was served with 3 pieces of smoked grilled bread. I liked the smoke flavor but 2 of the 3 pieces were so charred on the outside that I was basically served burnt bread.  I had a bite of the honey chipotle salmon which I liked better, but had the same problem of being grilled for so long that it had an unpleasant bitter char on it.   The only redeeming quality of my meal was the friendly service.   After all that I was still hungry. I went to a nearby Chik-Fil-A right after my meal and felt more satisfied eating a grilled chicken sandwich for $5 lol. Quite honestly I probably would have gotten better food for cheaper at Red Lobster across the street (Burn!).   The decor and service are nice, but it's all smoke and mirrors if the food isn't good!",

Prices were OK, a little on the high side, but not too bad. 7 out of 10.  The food was good, not exceptional, not bad. We had a glass of wine which was definitely poured on the light side, a $13 bloody Mary, a dragon roll which was really good, the mahi tacos which were decent and a poke-bowl which was really good.  The poke bowl was not delivered as we ordered it, but the exceptional staff went out of their way to fix it and ensure we were well taken care of. They even ended up comping it, which was unnecessary, but very thoughtful. Fresh ingredients, really nice presentation, reasonably good flavors, good sized portions. 8 out of 10.  Overall, this was a good experience. The staff couldn't have been nicer, from the GM to the hostesses to the wait staff, everyone was terrific. We would likely go back during happy hour and try some other food and drinks. I'd recommend trying it at least once.",

    "text": "Oh, where do I began with this review? I wanted to try a new restaurant for my 29th birthday on Monday and I found great reviews for Smokin Fins. I told my fiance that's where I wanted to go so we got our family together for dinner. We arrive and our waitress is great very nice and friendly. We order our food and appetizers and everything was really good. This is where it when bad we get the food that we order for our main dish and maybe 5 minutes into us eating I see in the corner of my eye a mouse next to the empty booth next to us. I say out loud \"IS THAT A MOUSE\" my fiance and his sister husband jump up out of our booth and the mouse takes off behind the glass mirror on the wall. We flag our waitress down and we start telling her we saw a mouse. Then out of nowhere, he pops up again. The waitress looks just as shocked as we are. She says I'm going to call my manager. All the while we're just standing there with our food not being moved by any of the other employees. My fiance was so upset since no one made it a big deal and he felt like they had no sense of urgency. So our waitress finally moves us we all try to finish eating but so many of us couldn't even stand to eat any more food. Our waitress comes over and hands us the bill with nothing taken off for having our meal completely ruined. My soon to be mother in law was very upset when she asked the waitress what did your manager say. She told us since we have indoor and outdoor seating that was the cause of the issue. We were shocked at her response. Needless to say, my mother in law explained to her that was not an acceptable excuse. Another manager on duty came to our table to apologize and comp our whole meal. The food was good but that didn't make up the fact that it just ruined your whole thought of the restaurant. We appreciated there apologize but we will not be coming back to eat at Smokin Fins.",

    "text": "This restaurant bills itself as a \"concept\".  I'm thinking this translates to \"We have a corporate menu that we create in our corporate kitchen, following Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\".  Watching the activity here, and trying the food underscores that definition.  Normally, I choose to dine at local chains or independent restaurants, you know, the kind that eschew words like \"concept.\"  This was different, a birthday dinner for a close personal friend of my wife.  So, inner Esteban says \"suck it up, buddy, and try to enjoy the experience.\"  You see, I had already viewed the website and knew what I was in for.  Okay, enough of that - I'll just get to the experience.  We were quickly seated at 6:00pm on a Saturday (red flag) and provided menus for food and beverages.  There was no beer menu, but the server recited the tap offerings, starting with Coors Light.  (another red flag)  The server was kind of just doing his job.  He exuded a sense of \"I'd rather be someplace else, but I survive on the meager tips I earn here\" and really was, well, let's just say his serving style was \"hands-off\".  He spent more time chatting with the bartender and other servers than actually attending to his guests.  That pretty much describes the entire service experience.  I ordered a Blue-Cheese wedge, and the ladies ordered a sushi plate.  Birthday girl had been before and ordered a sushi she called a \"caterpiller\".  Uninterested server-guy did ask if it had antennae, but was fairly unconcerned after that, but did suggest the Dragon (which, upon delivery, looked nothing like pictured on the website.)  The ladies loved the sushi.  My salad was dry - barely any dressing on it, the bacon bits were stale and burnt and it was pretty much a lame salad.  Oddly, there was no ground pepper offered, and no seasonings of any kind on the table.  By the time uninterested server guy returned so we could discuss this, I had about three bites remaining and the point was moot.  For dinner, I had the \"Nashville 48-hour marinated\" chicken.  Wife had a Seared Ahi salad and friend had Fish and Chips.  The Ahi was cooked nicely, but the salad was just a pile of lettuce, as in No. Other. Vegetables.  (not as pictured).  It was also so light on the dressing, wife could not tell if was there and had to ask for more.  The Nashville chicken breading had good flavor, but again, looked nothing like the picture.  (I keep hammering on this because that is how corporate restaurants work - every dish should look like the picture.)  The chicken was clearly dropped in the used-oil fryer straight from the freezer.  This makes it tough and difficult to chew, which is not how a chicken breast should be.  It was also sopping in grease, so much so, I had to use a bar napkin to soak some of it up.  The plate was at least half-full of their disgusting looking seared vegetables - essentially zucchini and squash.  There was a mound of nondescript mashed potatoes under the chicken.  Birthday girl said the Fish and Chips was rubbery, and not much else.  All said and done, not my favorite restaurant experience.  I'm sure they have a market, probably the people that are taking a break from Applebees.  Me, I\"m like meh, there are better ways I can blow a hundred bucks.",

    "text": "Smokin' fins is a lovely sit down eatery with a great number of options. The ambiance is casual but you could still make it a fancy night out. There is outdoor seating which is nice in the evenings. Additionally Sunday has all day happy hour so it os half price on certain appetizers and all rolls.  Everything on the menu is presented well and seems especially appetizing. My first visit I ordered the halibut florentine and my mom ordered the ahi salad and we ordered the habenero clams to start. Each dish was nice and well portioned. The clams were alright. They tasted good at the time but they were not that memorable. The ahi salad had a lovely wasabi dressing that paired well with the flavors. It was a tad sweet for our tastes so we added some extra soy sauce. The halibut came with delicious mashed potatoes which I found quite enjoyable but the fish itself was a bit dry. Service was lovely and they came around often to refill water and check up on us.  On my second visit, my family ordered almost all the appetizers and some rolls. I have to say the appetizers are quite good, my favorite being the shrimp avocado flatbread. I highly recommend any appetizer with shrimp. The flavors are bold and there usually isn't breading to muddle up the freshness of the seafood. Unfortunately the rolls were not up to par with my usual sushi places. The rice is a bit dry and there isn't much bite to it. There could be improvements to the taste and texture but the presentation was beautiful. All in all I believe the more western dishes are great but if you want sushi I would try a different spot.",

I ordered the salmon Caesar salad, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that it was the most perfectly cooked piece of salmon that I have ever had. Not even the slightest bit overcooked, as often is the case. The rest of the salad itself was perfectly fine, but every time I think about that piece of salmon, I wish I had a plate of it in front of me. I'm going to have a hard time not ordering it again the next time I visit.",

The oysters are Blue Point and are from the Northwest area- good quality.  Their mango shrimp & mahi mahi street tacos for $5 each were outstanding.  Although street tacos are small (think tapa size) they did not skimp on the mahi nor the shrimp.  You get some fish in every bite.  Some places have happy hour wines that are hit or miss for taste and quality.  Their $5 happy hour wines (cab and chard) were very good.  What sets Smokin apart was the great service.  We had a gal named Andie who was a cut above in service and attentiveness.   As the saying goes \"service that is attentive and not intrusive\" was in play here.   She has a great personality and when we asked details about some menu selections, if she did not know the answer she went to the kitchen to check and quickly returned with the results.  If you have had servers elsewhere who guess, don't know or worse they shrug their shoulders, you appreciate a good server like Andie.",

The manager was nice and had them remake the rolls with \"new\" rice that was only slightly less dry. The roll itself (Platinum roll) was almost entirely rice on the inside with only minuscule pieces of fish on top. In the end they gave us free appetizer coupons, but we would have rather had the sushi comped.   I had the Southwest Poki Bowl, which was good enough. Flavor wise it was great, however the fish was on the light side and didn't taste very fresh. For $14 that could get you a giant Poke bowl at one of the many nearby places, so I also was a little let down.  I wanted to give 2 stars but I would have felt bad - the service was good, and everything looked pretty at least; the execution was just off. If I ever come back I will have to try something else.",

Service was below average (it was not super busy when we were there) and that was the main reason for the 3 stars.  Took about 5 minutes to even get someone to say hello to us once we were seated, once water was delivered it took two different request to get my glass refilled.

The ambiance is nice. Hostess was very friendly. She tried to sit us at a high-top, which is uncomfortable for me because I am short and my feet kind of dangle. I asked her for a regular table or booth and she didn't think she had one. I pointed to the empty table about 20 feet away and asked, \"How about that one?\" and she sat us there. She was very nice about it and said she hadn't seen it. Our server came over shortly and asked if we wanted a drink. We told her we were first timers. I asked about their happy hour specials (they have some nice looking apps but their drink specials are just $1 off--soso). She was VERY nice to bring us a taste of their house chardonnay and house pinot gris. Neither of us liked either so we order $11 glasses of vignney (I can't ever spell it!). It was nice but I thought over priced.   While we were figuring out the drink situation, we also ordered the happy hour calamari. We also decided on the Platinum Roll and Rock Lobster Roll with an order of Hamachi Nigiri.   Let me start by saying, I have been eating sushi for about 25 years. I have had it all over the world and I am pretty particular.   It took longer than we thought to get our food as it didn't seem that crowded. We watched other food coming out and everything looked fabulous. They do a great job plating their food! The servings are good size--thankfully, as it is a little pricey. The Platinum Roll ($15) was very good but the Rock Lobster Roll ($13) was kind of dry and bland. (HH is buy 1 roll, get 1 roll 1/2 off) Not what we were expecting. The Hamachi (yellowtail) was divine (2pcs for $6). It is always my favorite part of eating sushi and actually, I should JUST order Hamachi. I call it dessert and save it for last!  Notice I didn't say anything about the calamari? Yeah... it never did show up! That was very disappointing, but we were full anyway, so it was probably just as well. They made a GRAND gesture of taking it off our bill (really? of course you should take it off our bill!! We never received it!!)    We want to go back and try the seared scallop and Ahi ($25). Maybe we will have better luck next time. Server was friendly, so I don't how she messed up....",

The other order was steak tacos--on 2 inch flour tortillas, with salad and small piece of steak on each.    It certainly wasn't crowded--only one other couple at 12:00 and now I know why.  Probably should have sent the salad back, but didn't want to ruin a reunion with friends.  We won't be back.",

    "text": "We decided to try out Smokin Fins based on reviews posted on Ahwatukee 411 and based on reading the menu and house rules on the way....I have to say, Smokin Fins met and exceeded our expectations!  The place was packed but we got lucky and snagged two seats at the bar for drinks and dinner.  The  Judith Point calamari is as advertised - delicious (ask for a side of the spicy aoli to go with it).  I had the Caesar salad with blackened seared Ahi instead of the salmon and they were happy to accommodate that request. My wife had the shrimp tacos. Both dishes were delicious!  Madison delivered great service and we had a chance chat with Nathan the General Manager who shared the history of Smokin Fins....we had a great experience and are taking the whole family back on Monday evening (kids included). Sarah was terrific at setting up our reservation in advance complete with booster seats for the kids.  Nice to have a great place like this in the area - it was sorely needed!  Cheers to Smokin Fins!  Make sure not to overlook the \"Sides\" on the menu - I did, but my wife found them!!! Great, creative house rules, especially - \"Cheap fish is not good and GOOD fish is not cheap!\"",

    "text": "The wife and I went out to a new restaurant that features Smoked Prime Rib. We were excited as the menu looked amazing. We called from 5 min away and asked what the wait was like and the gentleman said no wait 3-4 tables open. We arrive and there's a 10-15 wait. Ummmm ok it's Saturday night at 6:30 we would have expected a wait; but the guy on the phone said no wait and did not take our name for a reservation (which they do take). No big deal, We go to the bar and my wife gets a drink, short 15 min wait we get seated... All is good. The waiter named Chris comes right over and takes our drink order and we also order 2 apps.  (he seems very professional and personable) Our appetizers Come and were really great, we got the Deviled eggs and stuffed mushrooms. Meanwhile, We literally have not seen Chris in 15 minutes our appetizers are gone and we still haven't  ordered dinner. A very friendly Female manager comes by and we ask if she can find Chris so we can order. After 2 Or three minutes she comes back and takes our order because Chris is MIA. I order the Prime Rib but unfortunately it isn't ready yet at 7 but order the Nashville style Chicken That comes with macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes and gravy. My wife Ordered a salad. My meal plan and the chicken is pretty tight. Nowhere in the description does it say that its spicy but The mac cheese and the mashed potatoes and gravy are Really Good. Chris zooms past us 3 times and finally we're just done and want to go. (Good service means everything to us.) Mind you we were probably going to order dessert but that was never offered as he never came back to our table which now has the credit card sitting at the edge. We were not in a hurry but were really tired of being ignored. When Chris came to collect a credit card and my wife asked  if she could speak to him for a second to express that he was unhappy with his service because of the lack of attention paid to us. He seemed un phased and gave a seemingly fake apology.  Wrapping up, If we return and want to have prime rib at smokin fins We will be sure that we arrive A little later when sure that it is done cooking  and have a different server.  UPDATE: 6/16/19 Service was great and like before the appetizers were amazing we had lobster tater tots and the lobster deviled eggs. I ordered the prime rib which was available and my daughter had the ribeye. Both pieces of meat were thin cuts of meat and tough. Prime rib had gristle and lots of fat. The daughters ribeye was charred and inedible. The wife had the Ahi Tuna which she really enjoyed. Conclusion: We gave it a second chance and will not be trying a 3rd. In the Future we will go to a Real Steakhouse. Very disappointing $125 Fathers Day Lunch.",

Not overly crowded, customers were chill and staff was amazing; friendly and hustling! Ambiance was cool and distressed! I liked. Now for the fare....  Plenty goods to select from; went with the lobster burger and smoky fries and my company had the tuna salad. Washed down with a crisp fresh IPA. Our waitress Nadia was absolutely amazing. Her customer service, attention to detail....smile and professionalism enhanced our evening. Great job Nadia! Oh yeah....the food was fresh and incredibly delicious!! End of story.  We'll be back.",

From what I understand, this is a Colorado chain that made its way here to Chandler, and I'm glad they did!  When arriving, we were promptly greeted by the hostess and immediately seated.  The waitress came to introduce herself in a timely manner and took our drink orders.  We were debating on an appetizer and she made the recommendation of the Lobster Tater Tots.  I'm glad we trusted her recommendation!  They were really good.  They were served with a side of chipotle aioli and ranch.  For my lunch, I ordered the shrimp scampi.  It came with plenty of shrimp and fettuccine.  There was a lot of sauce on it, which I did not complain about.    Based on the food and customer service, I think it is safe to say we will be back!",

First of all the service was great! Everyone on the team works together, helping each other out which is what I like to see. The happy hour ends at 6 and has some very unique options which I haven't seen before. Lobster deviled eggs, shrimp capers skewers etc. My friend and I ordered the edamame and pulled pork nachos to start. The edamame came out first and the flakey sea salt made them delicious. Then the pulled pork nachos came out. They were great! The only thing I wish was different was the cheese. I wish it was Queso instead of melted shredded cheese... but that's only because I'm a queso freak. Anyway, for happy hour they have buy one get one 1/2 off for sushi off the menu. My friend and I ordered the Vegas roll and the mango roll. I was scared it may be too spicy but the habanero cream cheese was the perfect touch to the Vegas roll. Overall I love the environment and the location! I will definitely be back soon with friends.",

The place was dead, which doesn't mean bad, but it now makes sense. The server was nice so that was a plus. We started out with the \"lobster\" tater tots. So basically it was a weird tater tot. Lobster?  No so much. Then we tried the \"lobster\" deviled eggs. Imitation crab meat (fish) is not lobster.  Then for the main course we had Nashville hot chicken. Hot chicken?  Nope. No spice, no heat, burnt flavor. We had to smother the chicken in Franks hot sauce to have any hint of flavor. The amount of hot on the chicken was equivalent to the amount of flavor in a La Croix soda. The Mac n cheese was my side dish. Taking spiral noodles, drizzling milk over them and sprinkling a hint of shredded cheese on top is not Mac n cheese.   Overall the meal sucked. Not good. I won't be back and you shouldn't come.",

I've tried the ahi, salmon, fish and chips, sushi etc. food has been fresh and tasty each time HOWEVER.. this place needs some help with the either the front of house or it's the kitchen. Either way.... 4 out the 5 times I have been here it's takes forever for our food to come to the table.. not like exaggerating ... like 30-45 mins. And almost each time the server apologizes for the wait. This last time (last night) all of our entrees came out ...except for my husbands... I was just about finished with my salmon plate when they finally brought his seared ahi out. Come on people- you didn't bake his food.. it's seared for like 1 minute on each side. Of course we got an apology but this is seriously nothing new here. Oh- and we ordered fresh oysters as an appetizer and those came with the meal... again.. not organized at all. It's unfortunate because we enjoy the food and atmosphere but we are going to start looking for a new place- the waits and wrong estimation in the kitchen is just insane.. every time ...? I get every once in a while but seriously each time means there's a management problem.",

I was stunned at the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant, my friends were all at awe as well.   We were all seated and our waitress served us drinks and appetizers. I am pretty sure every time something came out we were all amazed! The drinks were all delicious, the appetizers were amazing. I wasn't too crazy about the lobster tots, it tasted more like cheese mozzarella to us. But we got oysters, cucumber jalapeno margaritas, some rum drink, and some bloody Mary's and they were all amazing and delicious. The margaritas didn't taste sugary and nasty, it had a nice flavor. The Bloody Mary had a beautiful display of bacon and shrimp on top, my friend asked for extra spicy and they delivered. Whoever made this drink know how to make a real Bloody Mary cause it was tasty.   Finally our dinner came out and everyone kept saying \"oooohh wow\" because the display was beautiful. We all had to try each others dinners because everything looked so good and we were not disappointed. Everything from the shrimp tacos, wings, mashed potatoes, sushi's, sashimi, and rice was unique and delicious.  Our waitress was patient, visited us often (we were a big group of about 8). She filled our waters, answered questions, gave us recommendations, and accommodated well.  We were so happy about our experience here that we are already planning another night out to this place. Thank you for making my birthday the best and most memorable. I can't wait to come back! :)",

    "text": "My dinner companion was raving about Smokin Fins and insisted that we go there for dinner. Per my SOP I checked Yelp and was oh oh look at all the poor reviews. Well I'm glad I gave Fins a fair shot. We requested a booth off to the side as we had a lot of catching up to do and our hostess gave us a couple of seating options. Nadia immediately stopped by brought us water, took our cocktail order, explained the specials and left to order our drinks, perfect. If you like bloody Mary's you have to try there's it's an appetizer in a tall glass. It arrives with shrimp and bacon, and all sorts of BM type stuff. My martini was served exactly as ordered chilled to perfection and accompanied by 2 blue cheese stuffed olives.  Our server, Nadia, was excellent and very patient with us as we must of talked for 15 minutes before even looking at the menu. I did finally order the center cut tuna and it was grilled to perfection (rare). I asked for a spicy sauce to accompany my fish and was provided with their special hot sauce. It was perfect. My companion ordered a bountiful chicken Caesar salad and she barley finished it.   Post dinner we continued chatting and since the restaurant was only 1/2 full we were not rushed out. During this time our server refilled our water glasses and told us to not worry there was no rush.  Yupper, great, food, atmosphere, & service 5 stars baby!",

I loved the vibe of this place, very open and bright. It almost reminded me of being in So Cal near the ocean.   We started off with a couple of drinks. I really liked he concept of the icetini, but wasn't crazy about the flavor. 2/5 The cherry limeade I had though was on point, very tasty. 4/5 For food we shared the lobster stuff avocado. Essentially it was a tempura breaded avocado stuffed with lobster goodness and a couple amazing sauces. This was definitely a 5/5 for me. For an entree we shared the southwest ahi. It was also very good, loved the corn salad hat came with it. 5/5   I think the only thing I wasn't crazy about with this place was the price. It seemed a little expensive for what it was, but I'd still come back again if I'm in the area.",

Food was very overpriced in my opinion $20 for Lobster mac & cheese for only a couple small pieces of lobster is a bit expensive and bacon in the pasta was unchewable, it was rock hard.  Then as far as the salmon wrap it gave my cousin an upset stomach something wasn't right with the fish and it was such a small little wrap! I only took a few bites of my pasta and my server then took it and threw it out without asking if I wanted a to-go box. So at first she wasn't even going to replace my meal and then ordered me a half order with again barely and lobster. I'm over it. If I ever go back it will be for the amazing calamari and it's sauce.

We got to Smokin Fins at 6:30 pm thinking we had plenty of time before the Happy Hour menu was over at 7:00 pm. But the wait list was 40 minutes long and we did not get seated until 7:10 pm. Since Happy Hour was over we did not get Happy Hour pricing even though we were waiting on the list for 40 minutes. Left a bad feeling about the service and management. I heard a few other couples expressing their opinions about the same thing but management just said \"Sorry\"  Now for the good part. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and was relaxing inside and outside. The food presentation was impressive.  Service was just OK. The sushi was cut very think and cooked just perfect. If our dinners were not so good we would not return. Since the food was so good, we will give Smokin Fins another chance on our next sushi craving.",

We sat at the bar - Josh - was our bartender & server and Nate, General Manager (their \"Yelp\" names) - both did a phenomenal job of keeping our food orders coming, which was probably no easy task, as we tried a wide variety of items.  We began with oysters on the half shell - they come with a couple of sauces on the side and you have the option of dressing them or eating them plain.  They were tasty, fresh, and delicious!!  Moved on to the Avocado Crisp, which is like a small pizza with shrimp, avocado pieces, and a yummy sauce.  The steamers, in a white wine sauce, were very tender.  We had to share the Buttered Crab pot - this is definitely a \"to be shared\" dish - the crab was nestled in a old- fashioned Mason jar soaking up the melted butter.  It was served with toasted french bread for dunking - almost like eating crab in San Francisco!!  We will definitely come back again and again and continue making our way through their menu!  Thanks for making our Wednesday night enjoyable!!",

This place just opened so the service is excellent with them constantly checking up on you and making sure everything is up to par. We'll see if they keep this up a few months down the road though as things tend to slip, just like when you're out of your honeymoon phase in a relationship and you finally feel comfortable farting in each other's presence. They've definitely invested into this place's decor and I could see this being a place just to catch up and drink, even for those who squeal like a frightened pig at the idea of seafood. I loved the patio area - definitely doesn't make you feel like you just parked in some monotonous Chandler shopping plaza.   Food was excellent and everything came out on time. They make sure you understand from the get go that they use sustainable seafood which I can appreciate, though I'm weary about such claims. I'm so glad I ordered what I did. I normally don't order it because Shrimp Scampi dishes tend to usually only come with enough shrimp sized to feed a goldfish, but the portions were perfect and hearty to my surprise. No longer am I afraid to order any shrimp dishes at this establishment, in fear that it'll only disappoint me. Kind of like when I get the mail hoping I'll get something other than bills.   I do wish that they put some complimentary bread or snack while you're waiting. Besides the menu, they have specials everyday so be on the lookout for that on the chalkboard. I came with a party of 5 and everyone's food looking pretty amazing presentation-wise. The soup comes filled to the brim so if you were expecting to have to order a side salad, you might want to think twice as that baby could fill you up by itself. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is any of the nigiri because I don't think you're getting your money's worth for what they serve. They aren't an Angry Crab kind of a restaurant, more of a fish and general American food restaurant so don't come expecting any other sea creatures.   They have my favorite type of seating: booths - but just a limited amount so if you're hoping for one, just make a reservation with that request. Red Lobster across the street finally has some competition after a couple of failed attempts in this very same space. This restaurant was meant for Gilbert or Scotty, but somehow ended up in boring Chandler which I am so grateful for.",

The place is gorgeous, open air and really looks excellent. We had shrimp cerveche verde and it was very good. Then came The calamari by SUPRISE and it was amazing. Excellent quality rings only (which is how it should come). Didn't even need dippin sauce yet Had a horseradish based sauce that was good but could have been spiced up with a touch of Siracha sauce. MGR Sara and Josh made our visit with a brief history of Smokin Fin. They are both great at what they do and with staff like that and food like we had this place is a sure winner.",

I started off not real thrilled, coming in for happy hour with friends and opening up the menu to see the most unfriendly-vegetarian menu in history. Being a bit grumpy I dismissed them on my list of places to ever go again. My friends know the GM, Nate, so they called him over to complain on my behalf. Nate was so great in how he discussed their menu. Basically they can do meatless options on a lot of the menu- you just need to know to ask. He said that the owners and the Chef had decided years ago they didn't want to throw an unimaginative \"veggie roll\" or \"avocado roll\" on the menu as an afterthought for the vegetarian visitor. They like to build all their meals thoughtfully. I am good with that! Nate also gave us the history of Smokin Fins and how they came to the Ahwatukee area. That is a story you can find out for yourself when you come in and ask for Nate!  As I said, service is great here and the atmosphere inside and out so comfortable! Go to Smokin Fin!",

    "text": "I have been looking forward to trying this restaurant for a long time as we frequently shop at REI and was extremely disappointed with both the service and the food. My husband and I came in on a Sunday afternoon with our son. As soon as we sat down, we were \"greeted\" by our server who was definitely having a bad day or maybe that was just \"her\". We tend to go out with our little during off-peak hours, but noticed it seemed quite dead for a Sunday afternoon, especially with all day happy hour.  First stop, kid's chicken tenders with mashed potatoes. Our son just started eating solids, so alike most kids, he gave us a weird face and spit it out. We looked at eachother like \"oh well, another food bites the dust\". We should have tried it before giving it to him as we quickly learned it wasn't him. It had a sour flavor and weird non-potato chunks in it. Then came the \"ceviche\". At most it was three bites, but size doesn't matter. It had absolutely no taste and the shrimp was sub par. We quickly learned we had the same feeling about every part of our meal. Mahi Tacos, Arizona Breeze (tequila cocktail), Las Vegas Roll, Dragon Roll, even our son's replacement white rice had an odd flavor. Lastly, I want to note, I'm not a picky eater and was starving. I would have eaten anything and would never turn away anything tequila. I also served for years during college and totally get a bad day in the service industry, but regardless of service the food was awful.",

The service is good, food is good and the drinks are good.  I'm an amateur mixologist so when I watched the bartender shake a Mojito after adding the soda, I was puzzled. Granted, it was just one shake, but when only 20% of the content is soda, that's all it takes to flatten it. I said, \"did you just shake that Mojito?\" and she said, \"yes\". I asked her, \"won't that make it flat?\" and she said, \"Oh, no\". Uh, yea. It will.  But, since it wasn't MY Mojito, I don't care. If I order one there, I'll tell them not to shake it.

We sat at the bar and got great service from Nadia who has a very long Russian name. Just ask her!  The menu is nicely varied without being to large and the atmosphere comfortable. We started with the calamari appetizer with key lime aioli which was very tasty. They have a full bar and we both found an interesting glass of wine. I had the seared ahi and scallop combo over greens with grape tomatoes and fried cauliflower florets finished with chili oil. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the ahi ate like a steak. Very good!  My wife had their version of ramen with shrimp that came in a giant boat of a bowl which she enjoyed. Nadia  finished things off with a delicious chocolate martini.   To nitpick a little my entree was under dressed and slightly dry so Nadia brought me a side of chili oil and chimichurri which really completed the dish.  My wife felt that the noodles in her ramen were a little under cooked but she ate the whole thing.   Overall a very good experience and we will be back.  We spent about $120 for drinks, appetizer and entrees not including tip which we thought was pretty good.",

One Endless Summer Sushi roll, one Pullpork sandwich with fries, one Citrus Ahi dish. My Sushi was wrapped in rice paper, rice grains were undercooked, Ahi was NOT Sashimi grade. It was violently bland and dry. It was so dry that the rice paper couldn't stick to the rice and kept on falling apart. Pullpork didn't work either for Ron. But he like his fries.  There was one big winner though: Clint said his Citrus Ahi dish was amazing.   I liked the restaurant decoration and wished l had had a better experience.

Everything looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp when it came out - dry lobster, dry broccoli and dry mashed potatoes. I am not picky and those still tasted okay.  But the steak was another issue.  It tasted TERRIBLE with ZERO flavor.  I put salt and pepper on it to give it some flavor.  That still didn't help and I doubled up on salt and pepper.  It was THE worst steak in a long time.  My wife tasted and agreed.  For that alone I cannot forgive them. I spent nearly $50 on that meal, too.  I wouldn't nitpick, but in light of the steak and dry food I should mention the small things. 1) Meal came out well before appetizer 2) No salt/pepper on table - had to request 3) Sushi appetizer didn't include bowls for soy sauce.  Had to request.  I won't be back here.",

Smoking Fin's service is wonderful and we have several favorite servers; Colleen being at the top. The manager, Sara, is personable, super friendly and always on top of things. One of the most competent, hard-working managers we've ever experienced.  As for the food... it's top notch, and delicious! Their Salmon, fired on a cedar board is out of this world, as are their burgers. We've never had sushi there, even though that's what they are known for. They have a diverse menu, happy hour and always great specials. We try to go 2-3 times a month and are never disappointed. They have something for everyone. Needless to say we highly recommend this place!",

My friend told the server the steaks were burnt and the young inexperienced server asked my friend to cut into the steak knowing the steak knowing was overcooked. I asked to speak with the manager on duty (Michelle). I told her the situation, she was kind enough to offered us another meal but I told my friend to forget about it. I don't want them to spit in our food. so I went ahead and told the manager we would take a dozen of oysters. The dozen of oyster came out stinky and unenjoyable. The quality of food and service here has gone down.",

So many great choices! As an added plus they have blackboard specials. The beers were super cold, YIPPIE! Our waitress was knowledgeable on the menu. We stared with the calamari. It was so tender, lightly breaded and beyond delicious. We did have a bit of a wait for our lunch and our waitress explains the ticket never printed in the kitchen.... our food finally arrived and WOW! Even thought it said the burger was stuffed with crab meat it seemed more like the crab was mixed in with the burger. The Mac and cheese had so much lobster claw meat it was ridiculous! We looked at the dinner menu, not a whole lot of difference from lunch menu. This is a definite return to place!!!",

The family an I where on this side of town (Ahwatukee or Phoenix depending who you talk too.. lol) and we where in the mood for sushi and burgers, yeah I know strange combo but Smokin Fins had what we where looking for. When you walk-in through the massive wood doors your greeted by the host/ hostess and seated. Yes I know that is nothing special but it's done with a smile and that should be noted. Okay now the menu !! But let me back track a bit since going here we have ordered all of the appetizers!! Our hands down favorite is the bacon and Brussels sprouts !!! Okay back to the menu, we have loved everything, and have yet to be disappointed in any way. In fact, recently this is our  go to place on Sundays because you can't beat the specials. Plus the manager there always seats us in our favorite spot by the wine bottle wall. Oh did I forget to mention the AMAZING WINE AND SPIRITS!  Yup all bold caps because that's what you do when you really want to express how much you like something. WE REALLY ENJOY SMOKIN FINS THE FOOD AND DRINKS ARE AMAZING AND THE STAFF ARE ON POINT.",

    "text": "Between 2-stars \"Meh, I've experienced better\" and 3-stars \"A-OK\", I gotta go with the lower rating.  It was our first time.  Arrived a little after 6pm on a Friday, the place looked great -- not crowded anywhere -- and the staff were very friendly and efficient, not too pushy.    But the food.  First visit, standard dish calibration: Calamari were in soft breading and and cooked to barely brown.  Didn't overcook the meat but there was little flavor and no texture, no chew of any sort.  What sort of place is this?  Prime rib and wedge salads, plus sushi and famous for seafood?  Over-the-top corporate menu.  My wedge salad was big with lots of garnish but only kind of resembled one; definitely not a knife-cut wedge of iceberg.  In comparison, the Caesar was tiny, with  shaved Parmesan but without any apparent Romaine.  My wife's plank-grilled salmon was reported as quite good, but my sliced roast beef sandwich on baguette was sub-par: all the meat was piled in the middle, where it was cut, to look abundant; half the baguette was empty.  A soup-bowl of jus for dipping wasn't much help though the small ramekin of horseradish was potent.  Regular shoestring fries were quite good but \"spicy barbecue\" seasoning on the side didn't impress.   When we left at nearly 7:30, only 5 tables of 20 were occupied inside, plus a few seats at the bar and on the patio.  Prime time for dinner and nobody there?   Maybe that's the message.",

More than the size, the rolls were fresh and very tasty, but the Lobster was a little too spicy for my wife. The pulled pork dish was exceptionally tasty.

    "text": "My son and I went here to try their Sushi.  Note:  they have some, but this is not a sushi place.  We kept it simple - sake salmon nigiri and California rolls for the sushi.  It was of passable quality, but nothing I'd go out of my way for.  They advertised a unique calamari dish, so I tried it.  It too was all right, but nothing special.  Finally, I tried the roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts appetizer:  this was way too salty - I had to send it back.  They remade it for me with about a quarter of the salt, but I still walked away feeling like I'd eaten a salt lick.  I felt pretty terrible after leaving the restaurant.  The waitstaff was well-intentioned, but inexperienced.  There were lots of apologies for delayed service, reading from notes, wrong meals served, etc.    Maybe I missed the meals that would make this place more popular, but I give this place a solid \"meh.\"  I won't likely be back",

Server didn't know they had a weekend prime rib special. The prime rib came out medium well and I had to send it back. Same for my friend's rib eye which had a very odd tasting rub. When prime rib came back it was practically raw and yet very chewy. Manager came out and apologized but we will not return.",

    "text": "We had higher expectations for this place. We so wanted this place to be a new go to restaurant for us to frequent. The yelp reviews and the food pics were just what we were looking for. It has a great location and the service was excellent, but their food on this experience spoke a different language.   We had the HALIBUT & LOBSTER OSCAR and the SEARED SCALLOP & AHI. For two $25+ plates these should have been delicious, especially noting that the Oscar dinner was one of their signature dishes on the menu. The Halibut and the vegetables were great, however, their could have been a little bit more lobster and a little less of that thermidor sauce. Overall the dish seemed to be a bit bland, but had enough food to fill you up, had it been tastier. The Scallop & Ahi dish was also disappointing as well. First thing we noticed was the lack of food on the plate for $25. It had a very scarce arugula bed and the vegetables seemed to be an after-thought. The scallops were fine, but the yellow fin was ruined by this extremely peppery rub that over powered the flavor of the fish. It was just too much!   I really hope this was just a one-off visit. I want to give this place another try, but convincing the other half will be very difficult with this experience being our first one. First impressions really set the mark. Very disappointing...",

(wow, really?)  Second time, arrived and seated at 8:45 pm, ordered and received food.  Ordered more food and server returned to inform us that kitchen has already thrown out all food and closed for the night.  It was 9:25 pm. Then they proceeded the clean up throughout the restaurant and had all the chairs on the tables by 9:45 while we were still there!

Both were so delicious and inventive, I had super high expectations that were dashed by the sushi rolls, fried shrimp in almost every roll, cream cheese which belongs nowhere near sushi, IMHO.  We decided to give it a second try, due to the appetizers, and try other items. The shrimp and avocado crisp was good tasting but not crisp in the least and lacked avocado. Lots of shrimp though.  The salmon Caesar was really good but huge.  My husband ordered the Captain Crunch fried ice cream. Expected a crunchy crust, not even close.  I ordered a glass of over priced Chardonnay that was so bad I had to ask for a glass from a new bottle.",

That soup- to die for!  I will be back-and ready to scarf I sat at the bar, and Meg B was a wonderful waitress.   She was a good singer too! Fun gal .  Nice ambiance ...not busy for a Sat. I hope they stay in business! Seems robbed a tough corner; I've watched several restaurants come and go.   The name seemed weird- but I'm sold - on the food  I can't wait to come back. And, come back I DID! _______________________ Part 2:  Came back once before, but chickened out and had the same thing, this time, I got braver and ordered Huevos Rancheros (from a seafood restaurant?)  OH YES!  When I read the corn tortillas were from scratch-I had to try it.   Man-it was so delicious. Those tortillas were so moist and really tasted like... CORN! Novel indeed.   The eggs were cooked perfectly. The setting is beautiful and the service was very good.   I will be back for Brunch again for sure. Who knew?",

We had the lobster stuffed avocado, which had a surprising kick, edamame, California roll and the lobster Mac n cheese. Mac n cheese was so creamy and delicious and had plenty of lobster meat  our waiter recommended the mango cake after and holy cow it was phenomenal! Definitely recommend saving room for a slice, although, (fair warning) a \"slice\" is seriously enough to feed 4. We had to stop ourselves from finishing the thing. The restaurant does seem a little pricey so it won't be someplace we visit frequently but there are a few more items I'd like to try off the menu when we have another occasion to visit :)",

    "text": "#666  Hosnaps!  Check out that number!  Sizzle!  Devil!  Hiss!  Fire!  Diablo!  ...Rock & Roll?!?  I couldn't figure out what I wanted to write for my 666th review.  I was thinking about a place with the word \"Devil\" in it but the closest I got were janky places that were Sun Devil related.  Then I was thinking about a spicy place but I kept running across Szechwan food which I admit isn't my favorite.  One thing led to another and I landed on Smokin Fins.  This place sounds both cute and super delicious without me having to burn my culo.  And even better, this is where I celebrated my birthday!   I had ordered the Brussels & Cauliflower [Brussel sprouts and cauliflower flash fried with blue cheese crumbles, bacon, and smoked sea salt. $9.99], Platinum Roll [Crab and cucumber inside topped with Salmon, Ahi Tuna, Hamachi, and Ebi Shrimp with layers of lobster-crab salad, spicy aioli, green onions, and tobiko. $14.99], and two alcohol beverages [a Spiced Mule and a Smokin Gun].  And what's even sweeter, the waitress brought me Tempura Ice Cream for dessert since my friends told her it was my birthday when she asked if we were celebrating an occasion.  How thoughtful!   My food was amazing.  I am absolutely in love with that Brussels & Cauliflower appetizer.  It was salty, the texture was crispy, and the bits of bacon and blue cheese gave all the vegetables a nice explosion of flavor. The Platinum Roll was tasty and I enjoyed every bite.  It's one of their signature rolls.  I also got to try my friend's Seafood Risotto and it was so delicious.  It had just enough white wine to make my skirt flip!  I also ate half a Blackened Cod Fish Taco which had good flavor.  The Key Lime Calamari was also quite impressive.  Lightly coated calamari rings, perfectly fried, and served with a side of key lime aioli.  Yum!  As for the Lobster-Crab Stuffed Mushrooms, wow!  They're small but packs a lot of flavor.  The decor was gorgeous.  We were seated at a long table by the back patio so it was a tad on the warmer side.  As the skies got darker, the lighting made the ambiance nicer.  I had a great night with some of my favorite people in the world.  Thank you for a great birthday dinner, Smokin Fins!   I would love to come back to try their other dishes!   A fish should swim three times --- in water, in butter, and in wine!",

    "text": "Well, this was my first visit. I arrived around 3:30 and I was the only one at the bar. There were a few other patrons scattered around the restaurant. In my Yelp search I put in \"Happy Hour Margaritas\" near my current location.  Smokin' Fins came up saying it was within 10 minutes from me.  So I gave it a try.   Happy Hour prices food range from $6 - $12.  I was torn between trying the Smokin' Nachos or the Crispy Brussels & Cauliflower. The Crispy Brussels & Cauliflower dish is flash fried Brussels and Cauliflower with blue cheese crumbles, bacon and sea salt. I asked the bartender which dish did she prefer, she said Crispy Brussels so that's what I went with.  The food took a while to come out.  As I was sitting there starting to wonder where my food was, I heard the bartender ask someone to check on it.  I ordered my second drink before my food came out.   It smelled delicious when it was placed in front of me.  First bite, yummy - but salty!  My first bite I made sure to have a piece of everything on my fork.  The flavors were awesome.  I took a few more bites, same thing - a bit too salty.  Also, for a flash fried dish, it was heavy in grease. Maybe it was the bacon, not sure.  All the flavors together are out of this world good.  I think they should do without the added sea salt because the bacon gives it more than enough salt.  For the drinks ... prices range from $4 - 8 bucks.  I'm not a Corona girl, so I asked if I'd be able to get a regular Margarita on Happy Hour. The bartender said \"Sure\".  I wasn't informed there would be an upcharge.  No big deal, but I think it should have been mentioned.  The Margarita she made me was only OK, my second drink was simply Tequila with a splash of Sprite because again, the Margarita was only OK. Overall, I wouldn't visit Smokin' Fin again alone for Happy Hour.  It's kinda boring.  Some place you can go alone and don't feel alone because the food, service and atmosphere is awesome, this was not the case with Smokin' Fin.  I'd return, but with friends.",

I had a chicken thing that was good but the highlight of the dinner was the mashed potatoes and gravy. They were friggin awesome. I gave my girlfriend a taste of them and she ordered a side of them on the spot. I could drink their poblano gravy. Its that good. I would recommend this place and the potatoes to anyone.",

The hostess was fine. We were offered a table or both I choose a table not knowing the lay out. Once our hostess was escorting us to the table and I saw where it was located I asked for a booth. The table was literally in the middle of everything and the intimacy was not there. So it seemed like the hostess looked annoyed. I did not care though. The meal was good. My wife and I got the lobster stuffed deviled eggs and even though they were good. No lobster was tasted. I got the classic fish and chips. Greasy filled and the breading on the fish over took the entire taste. However, it was ok. Fries were good as well. My wife got fish tacos and she liked them. The drinks were good as well. My wife and I stayed for Desert and was overjoyed with the chocolate cake. It was fresh and rich. We stayed for an hour later enjoying our selfs. No one rushed us out.  I will be coming back for a second time.",

The folks here did not let me down! Only opened since March of this year, this little gem is sure to become a favorite spot. The atmosphere is upbeat and fun yet comfortable. The server was friendly, well informed, and checked on our table just the right amount of times. The menu has a nice variety but at the same time was not overwhelming. The food is fun and unique and so, so, so delicious. We had the avocado and shrimp crisp, fried calamari, lettuce wraps and edamame. Each dish was cooked perfectly and the portions were just right. So happy to have found a new restaurant! Cannot wait to return!!",

The rich and buttery poached crab was fantastic albeit a bit pricey for an appetizer. We tried the highly touted calamari and were satisfied but not overly impressed as they are with it. The lobster quesadilla was a crazy combination of flavors that worked.   Interesting \"icetinis\" served in ice glasses and a few other creative cocktails make it worth a revisit.",

The two drinks I got both did not taste as expected, but I just thought it was me.  he was fast enough so i was happy. Then we got a few small meals to share. Lobster tater tots were good, the best part of the meal.  Fried potatoes with seafood.  Can't go wrong.  The rest of the meal went wrong.  Stuffed Avocados tasted like mayo and fake crab, but still weren't that bad.  The Key Lime calamari was over cooked and like rubber.  The Brussels sprouts were so oily I stopped eating them.  How do you mess up brussels sprouts?  then the sushi.  The tropical lobster roll. It was a bad California roll topped with fruit.  The lobster had almost no taste, someone i was with said it tasted like water.  And the Dragon role was not much better.   I was very sad because I love seafood and was hopeful that it would be as good as the menu was.  Sorry to say we won't be back.",

My daughter and I like new places and being a person who eats and loves seafood Smokin Fins is right in my aisle of foods.  Was quite impressed to see they have sushi as well (wishing they had eel sauce) so my daughter was pleased. The California rolls are quite delicious. Haven't been dynamic enough to try any other rolls but I did have the shrimp scampi and even though it's not made with Alfredo sauce it's very good.  The ambience of the restaurant is small but quaint it has a very nice bar and table seating is comfortable. I'd highly recommend the place. Looking forward to trying new dishes.

The place usually has a decent amount of customers, but I wouldn't call it busy/packed. It's a nice casual place to grab food and drinks with friends or coworkers - mostly adults. The bartenders were nice but I did feel like the service was somewhat slow considering the fact that the bar was only half full.   They have some pretty tempting appetizers - last time we tried the lobster tator tots and they were delicious. This time we tried the Kickin' Shrimp which came with a lot of shrimp - would be good for sharing with a group. I prefer the tots, but those are a smaller portion so they would be best split between two people (or all to yourself!)   For a meal, I wasn't too hungry so I grabbed the BLT Wedge salad (which is labeled more as a side salad). The produce was fresh and the bacon was amazing. I would recommend if you are looking for a lighter meal (or if you fill up on apps!)",

Plump beans with a great seasoning dipped in a house soy sauce. Not slimy. Seemingly not frozen because of the bright green color and lack of freezer burn. My entree was their house fettuccine shrimp scampi. The tail-on shrimp were large, seasoned to perfection and a top a bed of garlic and light butter cream noodles. Most restaurants hold back on the meats and seafood. Not with this dish. It could feed two easily.  I was overly surprised on the dishes even after a delivery. They came hot and steaming. My next move is to dine at the restaurant after this try-out.",

Saw the good reviews on good ole Yelp and it didn't disappoint.   First: you gotta be a fan of sushi and coastal inspired Mexican food. The name after all is Smokin Fins, so think seafood inspired meals with a kick! I have to admit I've never come across a restaurant that serves a wide array of specialty sushi rolls AND decent tacos.   Second: the selection is endless, I saw things on the menu from burgers to lobster Mac and cheese to edamame appetizers. It's very unique and you're in for a flavor adventure, so keep an open mind. I'm sure there's something for everyone, so this place seems like it's versatile in satisfying a group with picky palates.   Ambiance was great, the lighting was all updated and beautiful. There's a decent sized full bar and everyone was very friendly.   The bathroom in the ladies room was clean but the lock on the door was broken. Our food room a bit longer than expected to come out and it wasn't busy when we went.   Overall, I'm going to try this place again next time I'm in the area. Such a refreshing concept to incorporate sushi and modern coastal inspired Mexican cuisine.",

It was a bit loud in there though.  Booths are comfortable.  Everything was clean.  The service was excellent! My waitress was attentive and answered all my questions about the menu with confidence. She was super friendly and didn't bug me all.  Also very efficient.  K, best part: the food!  To start, I had the Bloody Mary, which I've never ordered at a restaurant before, but this one was garnished with bacon and shrimp so I had to try it. Because bacon.  It was spicy and delicious!  For my entree, I had the pistachio halibut with smashed potatoes and asparagus. I didn't even try the asparagus because I got so wrapped up in the halibut and potatoes! Both were to die for.   So why I give 4 stars and not 5, you ask? Because of the prices!  $28 for pistachio halibut? Really? Come on. I would have expected to pay $20, or at the most $23, but $28 is dumb.  That said, I know there's no logic in what I'm about to say, but I'd so order that again. It was just that good. So, I guess it's worth the $28.    For dessert, upon the waitress's recommendation, I had the bread pudding. I normally do not eat bread pudding cuz it's weird to me.  But this was bread \"pudding\" on steroids. It was big, it had chocolate chips in it, bourbon sauce, AND ice cream! I died. This is me writing a review from beyond.   If you're in the Chandler area, I absolutely recommend eating here!! Do et. You will not be disappointed!",

No light, so we ordered fish and chips.  It was fine but the French fries were frozen.  The fish was greasy.  My husband ordered a key lime pie to go.  It took forever.  It was pulled from the freezer.  Three stars because the Kona draft was great   Women's restroon was dirty at 3:30 pm.",

    "text": "Decided to try Smokin Fins out on a Monday night and I'm so glad we did!  I looked over the menu before arriving so I already knew I wanted to get the Lobster Tots and Fish and Chips. I'll get to just how great they both were in just a second.   I arrive around 530 pm so happy hour was still going on until 6pm. I took advantage of getting the Fins Mule at the happy hour pricing of $7. The mule was in a very large cup and certainly worth the price!  There's plenty of liquor inside so 1 or 2 should be a good start for anyone.   The Lobster Tots arrived about 10 minutes after ordering them. They were so delicious. I really liked the ranch dip and the zesty/spicy flavor of both the tots and ranch together. I will say that the mesh of flavors kind of overpower the lobster taste but still everything taste very good!  The Fish and Chips were the star of the show. I got the salmon and I was so happy that it was battered like fish and chips should be. You have a choice of Cod, Salmon, or Halibut all ranging in price. I'm pretty hooked on the Salmon but I would be open to trying the other options as well. The fries we seasoned nicely and came with a side of ketchup for dip. I dipped them in the tarter sauce as well which made for a great combination.   The total for 2 drinks, Appetizer, and 2 entrees came out to just around $60 bucks. Smokin Fins is certainly a great bang for your buck!",

    "text": "Smokin Fin is a restaurant chain around the US with somewhat of a fusion or at least what I consider a mesh of cuisines.  They have restaurants name like Naked Fins, Lucky Fins, and of course Smokin Fins.   With influence of Asian, Mexican, and Northwestern cuisine; Smokin Fins definitely doesn't lack in the option department on their menu.  We started with a basic edamame; which was as I described.  The moved on to their Brussel Sprouts and Cauliflower appetizer; which is probably my favorite because of the sea salt and their Chimi-Ranch dressing.  For my entree I ordered their Hatch Green Chili Chicken tacos.  Overall, the most intriguing this was the house made corn tortilla; fluffy and thick, but not too dry.  I was somewhat disappointed though because I expected a uber kick because in New Mexico; them Hatch Chili's were no joke, but damn kicked my ass.  I didn't get that here on my tacos, but still okay.    In the end Smokin Fin was a solid place and probably better for a good HH down in the Ahwatukee area.  Service was good and the ambiance was chill, but not too rowdy.  -- Enjoy!",

    "text": "Went in today to try out their Happy Hour menu. My wife said this is now her most favorite Happy Hour place. We had 3 different orders of street tacos, an order of Tune Tataki, and the fried brussel sprouts and cauliflower. Everything was delicious! We both couldn't stop eating the brussel sprouts and cauliflower. It has bacon and blue cheese crumbles on it, with some blue cheese dressing on the side. I'm picky about blue cheese, and this stuff was fantastic. Not to much bitter bite like many blue cheeses have.   The service was fantastic, and the open atmosphere of the restaurant is very inviting. This will now be our go-to Happy Hour place. There's some there for whatever food your in the mood for.  Edit - I've been coming to this place for about a year at least once a month. Today I meet an old friend there, and our service was poor. The food quality seems to be dropping, and the prices on their new website don't match the prices in the restaurant. Neither does the menu offerings. The website shows several things not listed on their menu, and the prices are $1 to $3 dollars more in the restaurant. The first time I saw this a few weeks ago I blew it off, but now a month later there's no excuse for these errors.  Their happy hour isn't that happy anymore because of this issue. This place lost my favorite place to go status today.  VERY SAD! I HOPE THEY GET NEW MANAGEMENT SOON!",

    "text": "Met up with my boyfriend here for dinner. He got there first and he said that he was waiting in front to be seated for like 10 mins and no one greet him. He decided to just walk in because he needs to use the restroom and then one of the waitress asked if he have been helped yet. He said \"no\" so they seated him. Then I came in and I thought the restuarant look nice and fancy.   My boyfriend ordered the old fashion while he was waiting for me. We think it was interesting because they added 2 small pieces of bacon in it, but it tasted fine. I wouldn't recommend to have bacon in the drink just because after awhile, you can see the drink looks oily. They should've just put 2 bacon on the toothpicks and stick on top of the drink so that it still stay crispy and not soggy. We ordered the key lime calamari with the signature key lime aioli. It was very delicious and I love the crispiness of the breaded calamari. Then we order the entree, my boyfriend orderd the 48 Hour Nashville Chicken, which we feel disappointed. We think Popeyes look better than this. It was just 2 small plain chicken breast breaded. It was the most plain and blanded chicken we ever pay this much for and it was $14.99. We could've just went to churches chicken or Popeyes for better chicken for less than $14.99. And it came with the sides of mac n cheese and Cesar salad. The mac n cheese was plain and blanded as well. I ordered the seared ahi salad, I think it's very delicious and light, and I love the dressing.   The service was ok. She doesn't put a smile on her face and hardly start a conversation. She just came to take the order and left hurriedly.  I wouldn't recommend or come back to this restaurant. Its expensive and stuff that they serve, we could've done it at home or find somewhere else better. By the way, my boyfriend went home unsatisfied and still hungry.",

It has something for every major food category.   El Paso isn't just a city in Texas, it's what you should do if you're thinking about coming here!    Our service was at least friendly and helpful but the food is another whole train wreck.  I had the Nashville chicken. It came out dry and half battered. Me thinks it was double cooked.....  asked for some extra hot sauce that they used for the chicken and got some franks red hot - which thankfully I like.   I subbed the mashed taters for \"truffle fries\".  I wasn't born yesterday but those were regular fries dusted with some green stuff.  The Mac n cheese - made the same way you make nachos. Sprinkle shredded cheese on top and microwave.    If your looking for good food or a good date night, keep on shopping for another stop.",

I ordered the Shrimp Scampi Pasta. The shrimp were juicy and a nice size.The pasta was cooked well. I really like the cheese flavor in the dish. Yummy! It just needed salt and pepper.  Overall, we had a really good experience. Good food, atmosphere and service. I'll be back to try the bottomless mimosas with my girlfriends on Saturday or Sunday 11am-2pm.

Their entrees are served in quite generous portions, and is definitely more than just filling! I ordered the blackened fish tacos made with Alaskan cod, and liked it a lot. It was served on a bed of really tasty lime rice, along with a side spicy chipotle sauce. Some of the entrees my colleagues ordered included the Nashville chicken, shrimp soup bowl, and the Baja chicken salad, and they all looked amazing. The ambience is nice and calm, I would definitely recommend this place for large groups and corporate luncheons. :-)",

We arrived around 8ish and the place was somewhat hopping. I say \"somewhat\" only because there's people but it's not quite packed. We were seated right away and immediately we decided on our drinks. Margarita and the Beach Bum. Both drinks sounded great on paper but left us feeling empty and sad. Beach bum lacked alcohol and had way too much syrup. Not a very well crafted cocktail at all. Already it was a sign for us to leave yet we stayed against our better judgement.   For food, we ordered calamaris, lobster tater tots, steak tacos, and southwest poki bowl. All of which were unsatisfactory to say the least. Our appetizers were salty and entrees just bland. We had to ask for sauce to help make these dishes better. It shouldn't be this way.   To all my foodies out there, skip this place. Don't be a victim of bad food and cocktails.",

The sushi roll was really tasty... almost too pretty to eat! The Poki bowl was better than I thought it was going to be... LOTS of fish included... not just ahi but salmon & yellowtail. It had mixed greens, pepitos, rice, roasted corn, & edamame. We sat in the bar area & Josh served me a \"nectarini\"(?) made with nectarine vodka & served in a glass ice mold...quite nice.

I really enjoy the halibut it's served in a cream sauce with asparagus and some cauliflower mash and I thought it was a top seller but it wasn't on the menu tonight which I have to say was disappointing but the tacos were still great. The Nashville chicken is amazing. They put a little spice in the batter and it's a white breast no bone. Perfection. The only problem with this dish is there wasn't enough chicken I think they should have done 2 pieces especially with the price. The patio is always packed which is a great sign. The midterms are a little more intense then they probably need to be but I get it, it's Arizona.",

Thought SF was another attempt at a sushi joint, but was pleasantly surprised. Didn't know it was a chain with diverse menu and decided to give it a try. Tried sushi, Blue Point Oysters, lobster deviled eggs, shrimp avocado crisp, and our 3 year old had the Mac n cheese. Solid draft beer list and a lot of cocktail options. Zero complaints...service was super friendly, didn't even notice the chalkboard next to the bar with all the fresh seafood options on it. If sushi is not your thing there are plenty of fresh seafood options like cedar planked salmon, pistachio crusted Alaskan halibut (getting that next time), the list goes on. For having so may items on the menu they really did everything we had fantastically. Think even the pickiest of eaters could find something to enjoy here. Support it...I think this place could be around for a long time.",

I wasn't too hungry and so I ordered a light dinner. I had the fried calamari which was delish and no complaint. I had the seared tuna salad and wasn't pleased at all! The lettuce was room temperate and other veggies were soggy no crunch to it at all. The seared tuna tasted like it's been seared since opening and sitting in the refrigerator. So sad to say but how can you mess-up a salad?!?! Hopefully others had a better experience than I did. Totally disappointed!",

I  had tried to flag her down on numerous occasions but she would never make eye contact with us. I had to get the attention of another server asking if he would please get her over to our table. She finally shows up and asks if we would like to order drinks. I told her she already delivered our drinks bite wanted food. Not a good start. My wife ordered sushi and I had a pulled pork sandwich. The sushi was not wrapped in seaweed but rice paper and extremely dry. She said it was the worst sushi she ever had. Pulled pork usually has a sweet bbq sauce taste but mine was hot and spicy. I enjoy hot and spicy but not with pulled pork. Just not a very good lunch. We have no reason to go back there.",

Waters were rarely refilled, we were forgotten around the time we were expecting the check, and one of the plates was dirty. Her friendly demeanor made these things easy to brush off, but that is what is keeping this place from 5 stars.  Their beer list is short, but there are some decent options. The menu says to ask the server for beers on tap, so I am assuming they change it up often. There are plenty of interesting cocktails listed. We were pretty happy with the food. The calamari was solid, and we ordered a really good happy hour appetizer that I do not see on the menu now -- it was like a shrimp and avocado thin crust pizza, but the exact name of the dish is escaping me now.   I had the honey chipotle salmon as my entree. That was just about as good as salmon gets! The honey chipotle glaze had a great flavor and the right amount of spice.",

    "text": "I had stumbled across Smokin' Fins while looking for some cool new healthier eateries in the area, and I consider this place an unknown hot spot!  It wasn't hot in the sense that it was super busy on a Saturday evening a little after 9 when we arrived (but it was literally a little warm inside - I would have appreciated a little cooler climate this time of year inside a restaurant) ... It was quite slow/empty at the time we arrived, but that is no shocker seeing how this area of Chandler is not known for a lively night life scene.   The ambiance:  I loved the chill atmosphere - it was nicely decorated, fresh, modern, trendy, hip, cool.  At first glance it appears like a cool spot to hang at that you would find in N. Scottsdale, and it was even better since they offer a reverse happy hour after 9pm Fri & Sat - love it!!!  So does Smokin' Fins live up to all the great yelp reviews?  For the most part... YESSSSS!!  For drinks: we tried a glass of Pinot Grigio and one of their seasonal mango icetinini's which was neat-o ... I've never seen one of these ice martini things before!  For eats:  we tried an order of edamame, the seared divers scallops, and chicken tacos.  The edamame was pretty standard - it's pretty hard to screw that one up!  The chicken tacos were yummy! And the scallops smoked on cedar wood with bacon ranchero sauce were amazing (nice presentation too!) - that is a lot coming from someone who loves scallops and tries them nearly everywhere he goes!  The service:  our waiter was good for the most part; always asked if everything was okay and if there was anything else he could get us (minus his screw up on the food charges)  The only slip up:  I noticed when I reviewed the bill today - that since it was happy hour we should have received the happy hour prices on the edamame and the tacos, but as you can see on the bill (picture) ... our waiter charged us the regular price on both of these items and only deducted $1 for the icetinini happy hour special.  So essentially, I ended up paying more than I should have $1 on the edamame and $8 on the Tacos.  Note that on the bill it says mahi mahi tacos, but the waiter substituted chicken in for the fish.    So with tax I probably over paid by approximately $10 ... If I return during happy hour I will double check the bill before paying and walking out.  It happens, but I won't be able to give a 5 star review based on that sort of gross negligence/lack of due diligence.  My advice to other yelpers would be to review your bill thoroughly if you come in for happy hour ...   Overall, this new local trendy hot spot earned a solid 4 star review in my book, and I will return for reverse happy hour to diligently see if my next server calculates the happy hour specials correctly on my bill  ;)",

    "text": "I have driven past this place numerous times and read a sign touting \"freshest seafood\" so I decided to go with my 2 teens.  We started with the calamari..unbelievably bland. The batter had no flavor and the dipping sauce tasted like a slightly spicy ranch dressing.  We followed with the dragon roll and platinum roll. Both were so bland and the seafood in them was almost nonexistent. Such a disappointment. We usually will stuff ourselves with sushi and we actually left about 10-12 pieces it was so bad.   I will say the staff was very friendly and attentive but I will not be returning.",

I ordered two sushi rolls (order 1 roll & the 2nd roll 1/2 price during happy hour). It was quite delicious. Service was outstanding, server was very attentive, and the general area is relaxing, clean, and well decorated. If you are looking for a place for a date night in Chandler, I highly recommend this place.",

Our server Nancy took great care of us.  Their company values were clear... quality and service.    We will definitely be back!!",

Waiter mixed up every check,  took 25 minute to fix . What amazed me was they way the food was delivered.  Food runner arrives with 2 meals and yells out WHO GET THIS???????Are you kidding me?  If 0 Stars was an option that would be my rating.  One and Done   By the way the food was pretty good",

    "text": "It appears the Ahwatukee area has been saved from the vacuous culinary wasteland proliferated by fast food and fast food hybrid (i.e. Chipotle Mexican Grill Et Al) restaurants that plague our vista with unimaginative options -  I visited Smokin' Fins Friday, March10th and was pleasantly impressed on many levels:  ~  Quality of food, fresh, tastefully prepared ~ Creativity of food - superb and well-plated ~ Restaurant staff - professional, courteous, prompt, friendly ~ Overall experience - outstanding  I sampled several items that are noteworthy: Oysters on the half shell, very fresh; Lobster Stuffed Avocado - a brilliant flavorful item imaginatively prepared; Lobster Tater Tots - definitely does not hide the lobster content, a very innovative item; Lobster Mac & Cheese - no skimping on the lobster in this dish, it was very good - but hey, it's Mac & Cheese so while good it can't rate in the \"most Innovative\" category; Mahi Mahi (daily special) - was very good as well.  The fish was prepared perfectly.  Another honorable mention - The Icetini's, which are poured into a \"glass\" crafted out of ice (it melts away gradually into an outer vessel that supports the ice-glass).  What a clever concept.  The ambiance like the food reflects attention to detail.  It edges toward upscale without being pretentious.  In summery, it was clear that the management of this restaurant has a well thought-out concept and business plan with well-trained staff that are carefully executing their opening.  Of course, much of the True test will follow, however, by virtue of the consistency in food and service unless something seriously derails this establishment I see no reason not to expect more creative dishes and experience's from Smokin' Fins.",

The entree salad was delivered after we queried about it. We were never asked if we wanted a refill on our drinks.  Whilst the food was good, our overall experience was ok. This is a fairly new establishment, so we'll give it some time before we try it again. Hopefully it'll improve with time.",

The decor, the food, and the very impressive drinks will surely have us coming back for more! They also have an awesome outdoor patio set up that is ideal for intimate gatherings or just a late drink. The staff was also very friendly and attentive. My only complaint is how rushed we felt when the time came to clear our plates. It seemed as if our server was anxious for us to pay and leave, she came by our table numerous times inquiring about the check and it made us feel inclined to leave...even though it was a Monday night and relatively empty. Aside from that, I suppose it could be chalked up to her having a bad night, our experience outside of this was great.   P.S. I also saw the bread pudding coming out of the kitchen FREQUENTLY, I didn't try it but I most likely will next time.",

After taking our food order she was never seen again so I had to stop a different sever, which I HATE to do, in order to get another beer. The server that I stopped was nice and took care of it pretty quick.   Then the New England clam chowder came out and was more like Curry Clam chowder. Should be advertised as their own spin on Clam Chowder...didn't like it, literally 3 bites and couldn't eat anymore. No problem because you can't please everyone and it just wasn't to my taste, HOWEVER the manager asked about it then made the comment, \"Sorry we'll take care of that.\"  Now I'm not into freebies nor was I looking for one, but when you make a comment such as that I was expecting to at least remove the soup cost or ask if we'd like a different soup since we didn't like it.   NOPE, neither happened.   I felt bad not leaving a tip for the 2nd server who ended up basically giving us the check and nothing else.  Literally, she did nothing else...since by the time she was assigned to our table we were done and only needed the check.   The place was NOT super packed and the male server I mentioned earlier was easily taking care of his several tables all around us and providing what appeared to be great service.   I most likely won't go back nor recommend this place. Sad too because the restaurant is nice and I work nearby so I was hoping I had found a low-key spot to enjoy happy hours and team meetings, but after this 1st visit I doubt that'll happen.  Edited to add a positive note, happy hour nachos and happy hour steak tacos were pretty dang good.",

I got the CA Rolls and they reminded me of the pre-made rolls at the grocery store.  I expected a lot more from a place that has the word, \"fin\" in their name.  At any rate the rolls were dry and pretty tasteless; they seemed pre-made.  I also got the deep-fried avocado, which looked amazing, but the crispy deep-fried skin to soft avocado ratio was a little off for me.  There came a point where it felt like you're just eating an avocado, which I suppose could be awesome given your taste.  All-in-all though my biggest issue was with the fish.  For a place that has fish listed in a majority of their menu, the expectations should be higher.",

Sitting at the bar, I paid cash for my first drink while waiting for my friend.  The change from a $20 was $9 that I wasn't in a rush to grab up.  After two minutes, my change was \"accepted\" as a tip and disappeared so the first impression was less than expected.  Follow that with ordering one appetizer specifically to meet some diet restrictions of our group.  It failed to meet the request and was replaced quickly however, the replacement was dry and tasted like the warming shelf it has spent some time on.  Bottom line - it has potential but suspect service and blah food.  Sorry fins.",

He was pleasant and answered our questions. However, he was all over the place. He forgot to put in my husband's order. My food also took longer than average for them to bring out. After we asked him what happened to the other order he said he wasn't sure that we wanted that so he never put in the order. Mu husband got a stake which should've been with fries as he requested but the waiter again forgot and brought mashed potatoes instead. The meat was burned and did not taste good. The price of the stake would've been normal if the tasted was good but unfortunately for that taste and the look it was overpriced!!  We were disappointed. We weren't even offered any compensation. It was 7 when we walked in and it was 8:45 when they finally brought out by husbands order that was again incorrect!  The only thing I enjoyed here was the ambiance!",

    "text": "Smokin Fins has become a favorite date night spot for us. Our friend Michael who we met at another eatery is now serving up his warmth, hospitality, and kindness along with amazing food here. This place has a varied menu that delivers delicious, beautifully presented food. The lobster tots are addicting! The tacos are fantastic (that rice is off the hook good!). The burgers are delicious and the salads are fresh and flavorful. The best part is they stay just as good later. I bring half the salad home and it makes for a great work lunch the next day. How many leftover salads from a restaurant can say that? (If salads could talk) Let's talk about the desserts. So far we have had the bread pudding, mango cake, chocolate cake and they are ALL a religious experience! Do you remember Zingers? (Those gooey, chewy yummy little snack cakes) The mango cake is yummy like a Zinger but made with quality ingredients. It is like eating sunshine I swear! Getting back to service; this is a friendly place. Nadia is such a dear, sweet person and we enjoy seeing her. When you go to Smokin Fins relax because the folks there will take the time to make eye contact and connect with you. It's not fast food. We appreciate this place and know that you will too!",

The menu looked great - and we saw the calamari (one of our favorites) so we knew we had to give it a try. We placed our order fairly quickly, but it took over 20 minutes to get our appetizers. Not the worst but it was also a quiet Thursday night.   The real problem started when our food came out. The calamari was cold. Not like luke-warm but actually cold. It was also mushy without much flavor.  We also got edamame which was also cold, and they didn't bring any soy sauce for it.   The sushi rolls were meh at best.   The atmosphere and everything looked so promising but don't plan on ever going back.",

    "text": "My fiance and I went to this restaurant last Friday, as we always like to try new places. Based off of our first impression of the menu, we were intrigued and couldn't wait to go try it. Lucky for us, even on a late Friday afternoon and during happy hour, there was no wait. Browsing the menu a little bit more we decided exactly what we wanted, we were set on seafood. We sat down, ordered drinks and the Kick Shrimp as well as the Tuna Tataki. Immediately after, we were ready to order our entrees, which were the 2 rolls we got each.  The reason for the 4 stars is because of a bit slower service, our server seemed to be more attentive to other tables. The other reason, not sure if this was due to us coming during happy hour, but I do wish we received a bit bigger portions for the appetizers that we received. I didn't care for the iced tea, lesson learned for the next time. Overall it was a fulfilling experience and delicious. There is more that we do want to try on the menu and plan on coming back. If not earlier, then for my birthday.",

    "text": "We were nearby checking out the Arizona Grand Hotel and saw this pop up on Yelp and we are so glad we did. We started with calamari with the lime dipping sauce - very good. Then the fiance got the Diablo roll and spicy tuna roll. Be warned, they do have some pretty solid kick, but were delicious and tasted very fresh. I got mahi mahi tacos which were on the messy side but also delicious, refreshing, nice lunch. Service was excellent and the music is good too - lots of cool remixes, excellent atmosphere. Check it out! 5*",

    "text": "Thanks again Stephanie. Best service we had on our stay in Phoenix. Ask for Stephanie!! Today we were in the area for a little shopping and found this restaurant it's on the side of a plaza ...being from California I was weary about the fish. So we check it out... it's empty but little did we know we were five minutes early from open and they let us in with welcoming arms... the manager sat us down and we immediately asked any recommendations and she gave us 4 which 3 of them we tried...first the tempura avocado half (best app by far) which was something out of this world... second we tried the special which was a grilled shrimp and strawberry salad... this is definitely for all those who agree raspberry vinaigrette is a bit to strong this was on the milder side... one recommendation is use a different salad mix rather then the garden leafs.... now to talk about the fish we had the sunset roll as well as calamari the sunset roll was outstandingly fresh as well as a nice kick of spicy to it. The calamari is a must try.... however the food was not only good but our server Stephanie guided us through the entire menu... including knowing every beer on draft... she also knew the lunch special and keep in mind we showed up right as the doors opened and she was ready for us. I thank her for making my birthday lunch amazing for my boyfriend and I.",

    "text": "We had a great dinner here. The food was wonderful!  We started with the crispy calamari and outstanding brussel sprouts/cauliflower appetizers. The california roll we ordered was fresh. The fish and chips were very good.  The fish was very flakey and not greasy.  The french fries were crispy and not oily. The salmon was cooked to perfection! It came with fresh roasted vegetables that were great.  The mango and shrimp tacos were very good.  There was a lot of mango which was very nice. The service was outstanding. We received a fried ice cream dessert because we were celebrating a birthday.  It too was excellent! I would recommend this restaurant for anyone wanting great food and service!",

It was all delicious and the service was good. We can't wait to go back on Sunday for ALL DAY happy hour. Prices are really great too.",

It will simple nock our taste buds stocks off. Megan the bar tender and greeter warmly welcomed me. Mentioned all the wonderful unique drinks being offeted.  The cute decor was accented with multiple screens offering the latest sports games.  If your craving high quality sushi that's fairly priced, I would strongly recommend this rock star place.",
