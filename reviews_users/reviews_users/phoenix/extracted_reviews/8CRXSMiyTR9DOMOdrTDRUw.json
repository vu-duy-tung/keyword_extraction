    "text": "This is by far my favorite sushi place in AZ. The same sushi chef has been here since the first time I ordered and the sushi comes out very consistent and delicious. I've eaten their traditional, specialty, handrolls, and even sashimi salad and they were delicious. They also have other Korean dishes which I've had a few of and they were really good too. It is just too hot in AZ to order the Korean soups but their meat dishes are great too. If I could eat here everyday I probably would....  Only down side is that the person answering the phones and taking the order changes often (it is located by a university so it is expected) so sometimes they take in the orders wrong or forget the extra instructions.  Or they get rude and hang up (happened 1 time only months ago).    Overall, really great hole-in -the-wall type of restaurant ran by... Koreans... that can actually cook Korean food... which I am very picky about as well.",

    "text": "So.... it was one of those days.... my friend and I had tried to go to some 4 different Tempe restaurants to find that they were closed (it was around 3 pm). Who knew that was a thing? ( not me obviously). So we found Gangnam sushi and were excited because they were open! It was a Friday afternoon but apparently the worst time to come to this restaurant for several reasons:  1. Lunch had ended 2-3 minutes ago  2. There is no happy hour on Friday... booooo.   3. They were not busy which somehow translated in the service being horrifically bad.   We were pretty bummed to have missed any potential for food specials, but carried on. I ordered the spicy tofu soup with 'meat' and an order of inari. My friend ordered a couple of rolls... one of which was baked (?!?!). I'm not sure how we got on the subject, but the waitress and I were discussing the way inari come and she told me they serve theirs differently than everyone else....she said it only had a little bit of tofu.... I decided to try it anyway. So the inari come out and they are EXACTLY the way they are at every other restaurant (little fried tofu pockets filled with rice). Weird. The soup I had was very tasty and filling, though next time I would probably skip the meat... it wasn't necessary and didn't add much to the dish. The tofu and egg and spicy broth was excellent. My friend's rolls were fairly standard. So here comes the sad part.... we ended up waiting for about 20 minutes for our check... don't ask me how, but we could not get anyone's attention. There were literally 2 tables full in the whole restaurant. The staff were all sitting around playing on their phones. We literally had to get up and ask for the check at the sushi bar. Ugh. I would come back for the food if I were in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for a return visit.",

They bring it out in a bubbling cauldron and immediately the spice attacks your nostrils. From there, my memory gets foggy. I just remember sweating a lot, eating a lot, and smiling a lot. The broth is fire (figuratively and literally) with swimming slabs of silken tofu that caress your titillated taste buds.   Second time, I got the Hot Bowl. When you get this (and you will get this at some point in your life, you will), you gotta restrain yourself when they first set down that sizzling hot bowl. Why? because that bowl is so hot, it's still cookin this thing. So, let that rice crisp up just a tad. Trust me. It adds this lil crunchy element to those heaps of meat and veggies. Then, bing bang boom. Surrender yourself to the goodness  They also generally show somewhat random soccer games from leagues i have never heard of on the tvs, so yeah thats cool too!",

Two people came late and had to ask for water from three different servers before getting water. We waited over 40 minutes for our sushi, before reminding a server, who wasn't our own about our order. Everyone at our table actually has been in food service, we could have certainly understood if the kitchen was backed up, but with a dead floor and three sushi chefs, that shouldn't have been the case. Then the sashimi was forgotten about. We had intended to order drinks as well, but after spending almost two hours waiting on food, we didn't have the patience. Our server Cody questioned us when we asked to speak to the manager, and then informed us that he was in fact the manager. I would strongly suggest some better employee training if this is the case. Jocelyn however was good, she actually brought us water and asked if we needed anything, and she was the one that checked on our orders.",

Price wise I can see how poor local college students may write it off as too expensive with so many other options nearby.   The biggest pro I have about the food is the soup.

    "text": "Was visiting ASU and decided to try this place out while I had about 6 hours before my flight. I found it really interesting that they do both korean cuisine and japanese sushi, so I decided to try both.  I wanted to try the Happy Hour but got here about 45 minutes too early.  So I decided to try their Kimchi tofu soup, which comes with rice and banchan. Their banchan consisted of kimchi, bean sprouts, maybe picked raddish, omelet, fish cakes, and cole slaw. The food took about 10-15 minutes to come out, so the banchan was able to manage my hunger in the mean time. The lunch serving is only like 9 bucks.  When my kimchi tofu soup came out, I was surprised to see that there were pieces of meat in it. I had assumed (probably where I messed up) that it was vegetarian because on the menu, all it said was \"kimchi\" and I didn't see any signs that it had meat. But I should have asked the server beforehand, so that was my fault. I asked the waitress what meat it was, and she said it was pork. While I generally don't eat pork, I am more strict with beef, so although she was nice about it and said it was an honest mistake to make, I kept the meal and just ate around the pieces of meat. Aside from the meat, the soup itself was very good and I really enjoyed it. So just a warning, if you are vegetarian or generally don't eat pork, ask them to make the Kimchi Tofu Soup without it!  So, when I was done with the soup, it was around 3, so happy hour!! Unfortunately, I was already pretty full from the Tofu soup!! But I really wanted to try some sushi because I was craving it and ordered hamachi nigiri and salmon nigiri, which were pretty well prices and $5 and $4, respectively for 2 pieces each.  The hamachi was good but the salmon was my favorite. I was pretty surprised how fresh the salmon tasted for being served in a restaurant in the desert! Very impressed! I wish I had more space to try out the rolls, but if I'm ever in the area again, I would definitely give them a shot. Overall, I think their Happy Hour prices are pretty awesome and I wish I had had the opportunity to explore it more!!! If you're lucky to be in the area, definitely come here for happy hour. The service was good, the staff were friendly and always checking to see how I was. All in all, great experience and I recommend this restaurant!",

    "text": "Update - Well that was fast.  Within minutes of posting my review, I was contacted by the owner who expressed his concern and empathy for my experience.  In short, the owner has offered to \"make it right\".  I won't disclose the details here; that is for the owner, Charles.  But suffice it to say, I am willing to give Gangnam another chance.  Seriously guys, the food is Really good.  If the service levels can be on par with the food quality, Gangnam has the capability to be a stellar source of satisfying your sushi cravings in the Tempe area.  Hoping for the best, and updating my review to 4 stars (primarily for the effort and courtesy extended to me).  Thank you, Charles.  Gangnam earns a low rating based on my experience.  And they lose a customer based on their ridiculous \"to go\" order surcharge.  Which is very unfortunate because the food was really quite good.  Never in my life have I seen a \"surcharge\" for simply putting something in a plastic box and wrapping a plastic bag around it.   So let me get this straight.   You didn't have to greet me.  You didn't have to seat me.  You didn't have to bring me something to drink while you waited for me to order.  You didn't have to serve me.  You didn't have to check on me multiple times.  You didn't even have to clean up after me.  And you're going to surcharge me for avoiding all of these things and taking my food home?  Are you freaking kidding me?   Like Ben C mentioned, sure, it wasn't a high price.  It's the principal, however, that translates to a slap in the face.   Piss poor business ethics, Gangnam.",

He answered all our questions (we had quite a few) without getting annoyed or seeming rushed.   We got the short rib soup which had a delicious broth and the meat itself was very soft and cooked to perfection.   The bulgoli bibimbap (which we were told is one of their more popular dishes) was definitely worth the hype. It was a HUGE portion,  sooo flavorful, and the meat was so tender.  Overall: great service, huge portions, and super flavorful food!",

The dressing wasn't great on it either and I ate a piece of tuna that was on the edge and tasted foul. I regret paying $16.95 for this dish.   Their volcano and paradise rolls were really good though. They were very flavorful. The house sake was rough, but $3 for a small, can't really complain.   The atmosphere was nice and modern. The music wasn't to my taste. The staff were consistent with coming by to refill our water.",

    "text": "So, I always sit in the same spot when I come visit Phoenix for work. I order my usual soondubu and soju. I come to Gangnam Sushi and Grill because it's the closest spot that carries soondubu, 5.5miles.  Blame me for ordering soondubu here, but I've been here 6 times in the last 45 days ordering the same thing every time I come, except for 1 time with my coworkers. As far as soondubu goes, there is no consistency in taste or flavor. Usually it's always too salty(and I eat salty), today, as red as it is, no salt at all. No flavor.. no salt, no soy sauce, no dashida in the soup.. As if it were cooked just using Dadegi for coloring. Nevertheless, I always finish the soup! The waiter and waitress are always very polite and speedy, 5+! The place seems clean and well kept. I think it reflect the korean manager or owner lady that I always see here. Good management, bad soondubu.  I haven't tried the sushi yet, but not sure if I will.   Any recommendations for a soondubu place in Phoenix that I can make my regular spot.. say 1 - 2 times a week for dinner kind of spot?  6/2018  Update: I was wondering if anything had changed and stopped for dinner with a co worker.   Ordered the same thing I always order, Soon Dubu, and so did my coworker. We immediately followed it up with a bottle of large beer and soju.(We don't mess around)  How was it? This is my opinion, It didn't get any better.   $11.99 Soup base: 2/5 Tofu & other things: 3/5 (literally 3 small cubical pcs approx 1.25\" x 1.25x 1.25\" swimming around very loose soup base. If they would've given me a slightly larger spoon I would've finished it in 3 scoops. There wasn't much else floating around in there. Asian markets have BC* brand of Tofu packaged soup starters that is much better with just a few scallions and don't forget to throw in last weeks left over protein dish.(fish doesn't qualify).  Stick with the happy hour and sushi menu. The grilled stuff wasn't bad either! :)",

    "text": "Was out with my son and his fiance shopping and we started getting hungry, after some debating we all decided that we wanted sushi, so my son took my phone and looked on up my Yelp app for places to go (he is a closeted Yelper haha) and found Gangnam Sushi & Grill, it was already on my mental list of places to go, because some of the cool Kat's I follow have posted some great looking pics of the food.  So off we went.  We were not quite sure we were in the correct location, but we found it, it's at the north east corner of University & Rural tucked in the back corner of the shopping center.  We were greeted right we when walked in, and shown to a table, it's a nice looking place inside.  We started off with an order of edamame, and some vegetable gyoza, let me tell you, the veggie gyoza are amazing! Deep fried, crispy texture and stuffed with great tasting veggies, a great alternative to the normal pot stickers, glad we gave it a try.  The boys went a little crazy and ordered quite a few rolls, I remember the spicy tuna rolls, California rolls, rainbow rolls and they also got a few of the specialty rolls as well. Everything was fresh tasting and had great flavor, Im glad they ordered a few so we could all try them out.    A funny thing happened after we ordered the sushi, I sort of got plate envy when I saw an order come out and I had to inquire about it. It was a hot bowl and boy did it look delish! A hot Bowl is big enough to feed 2, I'm not even lying, I had to pack up over half, which I had for lunch the following day. I got the Bulgogi hot bowl, it's a layer of rice topped with freshly steamed veggies, bulgogi and a fried egg, I also asked for the house made chili paste, gave it swirl on top it and dove right in! This was the perfect comfort meal, in fact I'm already craving it!  Service was great & friendly, and I look forward to going back.",

The edamame was delicious!  Mind your fingers, it'll stain.  Arizona hit the spot for me and not the best volcano I've had, but I just needed sushi and didn't care.  The rest of the menu looked appetizing - if you need some Korean food and some sushi, grab three friends and give it a try.",

It was my first time eating Korean food - that was what we mostly ordered. We came to the restaurant a few minutes before happy hour was ending (5 mins to be exact), and ended up ordering after it was over. BUT the waiter said that even we ordered after 7, we would still be receiving the happy hour deals because we came before then!  Anyway, we ordered a lot of food, and everything was delicious. The most memorable dish had to be the octopus dish on the happy hour menu - OMG so unexpectedly good. Also, the spicy vegetable stew (on the menu it was around $30), was perfect. All the staff kept checking up on us, asking us how everything was going, I loved that. There was this one older gentleman, I believe he was either the main cook or manager- but he was so kind. And we being the Korean drama obsessed freaks, told him how much we appreciated Korean culture and food, and we spoke a little Korean to him lol. He even gave us a drama recommendation. As a first timer, I would definitely recommend this place! It was a perfect girls night out. :)",

I was a skeptic about this place, but being a New & Hot spot on my Yelp app....why not!?  The place is not in the best location for a restaurant in my opinion.  I came here with a birthday dinner party.  Service wise I think they could improve; slow and inexperience.  I gather it's a new place and still might be getting it's kinks together however that's not an excuse I can forgive.    For our food we ordered the mackerel fish, Tiger & Spicy Tuna sushi, and the Bibimbap with Bulgogi.  The mackerel was cooked just right!  Salty to the bite and still retaining it's moisture; probably my favorite of the night!  Our Bibimbap was good, but I thought it was lacking in Bulgogi beef; probably another ounce or 2 of beef would have been welcoming.  I'm not a sushi snob but overall I thought the sushi was well plated and tasty.  I always enjoy a spicy and crunchy roll with some exotic ingredients.  Thus, we ordered the Tiger roll that included the Spider Crabs.  In the end, the 2 of us were pretty full and couldn't finish our meals.  Overall, I thought the food very good and finish what I could.  Not a lot of drink specials, but no complaints.  However, I was surprised at the price they were charging for some items which I could have ordered at other places for probably $1-$3 cheaper. - Enjoy!",

We were so hungry from working all day and greeting our awesome customers  Charles greeted me first and he was so welcoming and nice.  I liked the ambiance of the restaurant and felt very comfortable.  It's super clean which I love and my husband is crazy about Samurai swords and was checking them out on the wall.  Food is super delicious.  I can't tell you how satisfying it is to eat a hearty meal that you truly love.  We had the beef Bibimbob and it was out of this world.  Huge portion served in a hot stone bowl, fresh veggies and beef was marinated to perfection and juicy.   Presentation was on spot.  We also had the Kalbi Beef Short Ribs on a iron hot plate.  Off the chain!   Portion was generous, flavor = perfection and quality cuts of meat.  We also ordered 2 hand rolls and those were fresh and yummy too.  Charles checked on us several times to ensure we were doing good.  I'm sad we don't have Gangnam Sushi in the Bay Area.  I have to wait a whole year until I come back.  Charles, thank you for your outstanding service, positive attitude, friendly staff and most importantly delicious food. See you next year!",

We took my cousin from Korea there, and she liked the food as well! They were not busy at a that time so we had no issues with service! The servers were attentive and helpful! We were there til 2am when they closed, and the servers did not try to rush us out! Will definitely be back again to try out entrees!",

I usually get the Unagi bowl (most of the japanese place I go to), Let me tell you-- The portion is really good for the price and they have more pieces of eel as compared to other restaurants..

The nigiri sushi was the biggest I've ever seen, as the fish on top is the size of 2 orders at most other sushi restaurants.  Sushi and Korean food is always a A+ in my book.

The servers were attentive, and on a Friday night it was busy, but we were still able to get a table. The ambience was not that of a fancy restaurant, but still had a good feel and nice decor. With all the amazing pics of the bibimbop, i decided to order a shrimp one, as well as 3 other rolls: the salmon and scallop, the waikiki, and the volcano roll. The bibimbop was extremely flavorful! I want to return just for another taste!  The rolls were large and full of fish, not just rice, fresh and creative. The volcano roll was definitely rich,  the waikiki was a very straight forward but fresh, and the salmon and scallop had a great semi-spicy sauce. All in all, i cant wait to come back here. The menu has a great variety, the kalbi looked like one to not miss!",

First is the spicy beef soup the flavor and size of the bowl for its price is a steal. Second is the hot stone bibimbap is full of veggies and tasty meat choices. Just come. You won't be disappointed!!",

I'm not sure if it was the usual chef on staff, because comments were made when one of my friends sent his dish back. Regardless, my spicy tuna roll was mushy and the fish didn't taste fresh. The Kobe roll was a risk in itself because it had beef on it. I had never tried a sushi roll with meat! I was excited to try it, however, I was only able to take a few bites. It was tasteless, plain, and the consistency was a little off. Again, the fish didn't taste fresh. The service was great but unfortunately, the food was completely opposite. For the price, I would rather go to my usual sushi spot.",

And it wasn't just a small hair, it was at least a 6 inch long hair in the sushi I ordered. I thought i would just disregard it and so I ordered again because it was convenient but the worker who answered the phone was extremely rude and did not give any mind to me or my order. Just don't order takeout because they really don't give a fuck what they feed you.",

Although the sashimi is 'fresh' every day according to the waiter I still feel that $6-7 for 2 thin 2\" pieces was a bit outrageous.   I also ordered a spicy sashimi salad and it was  ok but not something I'd return for. My daughter loved the rolls and suggests 5 stars but I'm leaning towards a solid 3 so we shall go with 4 for now.  If you're in the area, check it out! But definitely not a place I'd go out of my way to eat at... The search for the perfect sushi place continues...",

It is a small sushi restaurant but very cozy and friendly.  We ordered a few appetizers and they were very good.  Sushi were fresh and tasty and they all had their own taste ( some-places they all taste the same)  Also have a big variety for vegetarian sushi, I would recommend to try plum one it is something very special, some of u will love them some of u will not, but it is unique one u have to try it at least once. Most of the rolls are priced under 8$ and only special ones are around 11/12$ but those are really big rolls there was 5 of us and we only ordered 3 big ones and 3 regular plus one big vegetarian roll and 3 regular vegetarian and we had to take some of it home with us.  Will definitely coming back and will recommend!  I guess we found our new sushi place!",

It was a nice, small and quiet restaurant with a cool Bambu mural that tied the space together.   For being a Monday afternoon, the restaurant was consistently busy. I can understand why some might consider it expensive and write if off given the area it's located in with the various options that are more affordable to a college students wallet.   Gangnam's menu is comprised of 2 sections-both Korean and Japanese styled cuisines, as well as a sushi menu. I ordered a Bento box that came with an order of Bulgogi, an assortment of Nigiri with Miso soup and a salad; my boyfriend ordered the Bulgogi that came with a meat/tofu soup. No complaints necessarily, other than I've had better Korean bbq. The slices of Nigiri were cut larger than most places which was appreciated. I will add that the soup that came with my boyfriends meal was flavorful to the point that I ended up eating a portion of it.   Overall, we enjoyed our lunch and appreciated the service.",

Usually I am skeptical of places that serves different types of Asian food, however they nail it. The crown jewel of this restaurant is the Korean bimbimbap. Wait for a few minutes after they serve it to you to allow the rice to get crunchy. The spicy pork bimbimbap is good, however the bulgogi is really the best. I havent had any place come close.",

I had the four-piece nigiri and \"spicy tuna\" roll, which had an up charge cause it is labeled as the four-piece nigiri and California roll.  I didn't want the CA roll, therefore, changed it.  Glad I did!   The fish atop the nigiri was huge in some cases, folded over, which is nice except not something I'd expect.  Rather floppy, which means either lower grade or getting old.  There seemed to be an \"off\" taste in something in the spicy tuna roll.   I can't put my finger on it because it was rather sudden.   My son had the four-piece nigiri with the CA roll.   Glad I didn't have that roll!!   I don't know what it tasted like, but it didn't look like something I'd want to eat.   Sort of looked like something I'd put in a tuna sandwich or cream cheese sandwich.  Some kind of mix?   We both agreed we would not be back.   Maybe it's good with its Korean dishes, but don't think we want to find out.  The server, Mark, was competent, professional and friendly.   I don't know what the dinner traffic is like, but I hope he gets more in the way of business cause not many people in there to get decent tips.  It's in a shopping center close to ASU.   That should have been a tipoff for me.   I've not experienced a good restaurant yet that is close to the school.",

If you don't mind forgoing the hot stone, it's $2 less for a normal bibimbap. My best friend gets the hot stone and the sizzling sound makes others crave it. We've found that the perfect appetizer to complement it is the Agedashi Tofu aka deep fried tofu which is lightly dusted with starch and soaked in soy sauce.   I often go during their happy hours where miso soup is $2 and the rolls are cheap. The mochi was okay but I wouldn't order again. The interior is cozy and pretty. The servers are attentive and are almost always on point with their suggestions. It's a five minute walk from campus which is a great plus!

The grilled spicy pork dish was great, except it was a little burnt. What upset me was the Budae-Jjigae. I was more frustrated than upset, because it tasted nowhere close to what it's supposed to taste like. The broth was bland and tasted just like salt water and barely had any ingredients in it.

I ordered the flaming jack specialty roll, one of those rolls wrapped in tin foil that they light on fire. Just a heads up, It was definitely on the smokey and spicy side which I really liked. The nigiri was some of the best I've ever had and also very large. Looking forward to visiting this restaurant again sometime soon.",

    "text": "Gangnam is a Japanese / Korean restaurant in the heart of Tempe. Well, at least it's close to the word \"Tempe\" on Google Maps.  I visited on a weekday night to check out the few vegetarian options on the menu. I'm happy to say I wasn't the only one eating alone. I don't know why that makes me happy... maybe next time I'll ask the stranger to join me for dinner.  The vegetarian bibimbap was disappointing. I was very excited to eat something Korean, and regretted it. The egg was overdone and vegetables were pedestrian. The only thing bibimbap about the dish was the bowl. I hate sounding so negative, but I want folks to avoid ordering the bibimbap.  The vegetarian gyoza wasn't much better. I couldn't tell you what the filling was. It was so fried it could have been anything.  But I ate it anyway.  The water tasted like the sugar from the soda machine. I felt compelled to grab my water bottle from my bag and drink from it instead.  There is a bit of good news here: The service was nice. As in, the people seemed genuinely kind. Two folks came by to take my order. Someone accidentally brought me vegetable tempura, which I sent back.   I probably won't be back anytime soon. Maybe I have to play to Phoenix's strengths instead of trying to satisfy my own cravings. RIP the dream of excellent bibimbap in the desert.",

    "text": "Gangnam Sushi & Grill is a great option when trying to get your sushi and Korean food fixed. I tried their chicken Bibimbap for the first time and I was not disappointed.  The portion size was enough for two people to share. The noodles were soft and flavorful, the vegetables were fresh and with a crunch, and the egg was perfectly cooked to give you that runny egg yolk flavor throughout the dish. The plate was brought in a giant hot stone plate. This gave the rice underneath the perfect temperature for the rice to get crispy. While we were waiting for our main meal, our waitress brought us the California roll that I order (which was delicious) and Korean side dishes. I was really impressed by their kimchi, flavorful with a nice spicy kick.   Overall, the pricing of the food is fair for the amount of food you are getting and the quality of it. It is definitely at an affordable price, I think this also has to do with their location. Gangnam Sushi & Grill is located near ASU Tempe. They are located in a small plaza near 8th Street and University. They are surrounded by other restaurants, including an Indian cuisine restaurant, a Vietnamese restaurant, and an Ethiopian - Mediterranean eatery.  Gangnam has an edge by having late hours during the week and the weekend. This made it convenient for my friends and me to grab a bite of food after a closing shift at work. Although we were there until closing time ( 11:45ish pm)  we did not feel rush to leave. Our waitress was very attentive and continued to make sure we were taken care of even after she boxed our food.  The ambiance of Gangnam Sushi & Grill made me feel like I was at a luxury Sushi place. It's a small, cozy location but the atmosphere made it feel like eating at a family member's house. There was noise from the other customers and the nearby kitchen but it still gave you an intimate diner experience with your party. Overall, I am very satisfied with the food, service, and atmosphere of Gangnam Sushi & Grill. I will definitely come back and let more people know of this place.",

    "text": "Gangnam Sushi & Grill- not only aesthetically pleasing, but beating the game in quality, taste, serving size of sushi, and most importantly, customer service.   I began my first course with two orders of the two-piece Salmon Nigiri, the Crazy Monkey roll, Saba Shioyaki (Mackerel), and Kimchi Chigae (Soup).   It seemed as just as I sat and ordered food, the food came out. Charles was especially helpful in making a recommendation and making sure I was enjoying my experience and food.   When the Salmon Nigiri came out, I was surprised to see the biggest serving size of sliced Salmon I've had. I typically can fit a Nigiri of any sort in one bite, but this Salmon Nigiri had me taking two bites. The picture I posted doesn't do it justice, but I promise you won't be disappointed. Taste-wise the Salmon was melt in your mouth delicious.   Next, the Crazy Monkey roll arrived. It was my spicy heaven. I'm a lover of all foods spicy and it really hit the spot for my Tuna craving. Beautifully presented with Spicy Mayo sauce and with added cucumber for that crunch.   Being Korean, my favorite food is Kimchi Chigae, and for who don't know, it's a spicy fermented cabbage soup, traditionally made with pork and tofu inside. I've had kimchi all different sizes and ways, but if it's not made by Mom or Grandma it's no good, but Gangnam makes it like your Mother or Grandmother made it.  First let's talk protein! Almost all restaurants I've been to in the past barely put a few chunks of meat, let alone Kimchi and Tofu, but Gangnam made my Kimchi Chigae not only over the top in taste but serving size! It was seemly endless and I was super happy about it all. I stuffed my face full and could keep eating passed the food coma (that's when you know it's good).  Coming for the Northwest, specifically from Seattle/ Portland area I've been to many sushi spots, from conveyer belt sushi, all-you-can-eat sushi to the upperclass sushi spots where clients from Japan would go to, and when I moved to Phoenix four years ago, I was highly disappointed by the sushi scene here. There had been many times I felt sort of ripped off for the amount of sushi given for the price, but at Gangnam Sushi & Grill not only do I have a five-star scenery to eat in but the prices are fair, paired with their attention to detail and look/quality of the food.   Now that I've discovered Gangnam Sushi & Grill I can say I will be coming here over and over again. ^.^ #foodie #GangnamSushi #NoRegrets #Japanese #Korean #Journalist #Vlogger",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I came here last night and sadly the expectations were much greater than the reality.   I got the \"Chicken Bento Box\" which comes with teriyaki chicken, rice, miso soup, a California roll, and a variety of different fried vegetables. The chicken was pretty fatty, and the fried vegetables were very mushy, and didn't have a pleasant texture at all. The California roll, however, was very good!  My girlfriend got the \"Chicken Yakesoda\".. or should I say \"Yuckeesoda\" It did not taste good at all. Whatever seasoning they used, they put wayyyy too much of, causing it to be way too overpowering which unfortunately made the dish unenjoyable.  The service was okay. The time it took from when we ordered until we actually received our food was close to an hour. They forgot to give us our miso soup, and our rice, however, what they lacked for in timeliness and remembrance, they made up for in wonderful charismatic personalities. They were very apologetic for taking so long, and forgetting the soup and rice, and were eager to make sure we were doing alright along the way.  The last thing I wanted to talk about was their water. I did not like the taste of their water at all. It had a very strong tap water taste to it, and I know it's all the same, but when it comes to water, I am very picky with how it tastes, and I'm sure a majority of others are too.  Overall, I've gotta say it was just average. It wasn't absolutely terrible, but it wasn't that great either. I'm sure if we had gotten actual sushi/sashimi instead of dinner plates we would have enjoyed it a lot more than we did, because the rolls that we saw some people order looked absolutely phenomenal.",

HOWEVER, their pricing is way too high. $13.95 for kimchi fried rice that is literally just rice, kimchi, SPAM (which costs like $1 a can), and a fried egg. They also charge almost $10 just as a delivery fee. That needs to be drastically reduced if they intend to be successful with online orders. Keep in mind that on grubhub where they are currently doing online orders, there is also the tax and the driver tip. So if I ordered just two soups I'm already over $40 thanks to all the fees and their astronomical prices. I wish I could order from them more often, but you have to be rich to eat here.",

We had tailgated all day and had been quite starving so we ordered: gyoza, short ribs (app), hot tofu soup with bulgogi and shrimp yakisoba! (We we're starving).   The appetizers were so delicious and made us crave more and the soup was absolutely perfect! Mixing the rice, soup and beef together was the perfect combination! Although the shrimp was okay, they were very generous on the amount of protein in their dishes!   I would definitely recommend and visit again. I would just prefer the land meats opposed to the sea. Overall great service and taste! You got a fan in me!",

The rice comes out crispy just like it should ;)  The sushi is also good, always fresh (tho the last time I went and had the chirashi bowl, only the tuna was a little iffy - everything else tho was excellent) I like this place because if you want sushi but you are with a group who \"don't eat no raw fish\" *_* there is quite a variety of hot food, which is very good too. They also have hot sake- happy happy ;D  The ambience is casual, it's not a hole in the wall by any means, nicely decorated, tho they need to repair some booth seats. The servers are nice, typically collage kids, not that that's a bad thing, but sometimes they can be a little distracted.   All in all a good go to place for hot and cold Asian grub.",

Me and my boyfriend got the bulgogi bibimbap. I was a huge fan of the bulgogi beef in this hot stone. One of the better bulgogis I've had in Arizona. I ate what I could because it was filling. Don't let the portion sizes fool you! We also got the sake bombs. It was litty. Might come back again to try their entrees.",

I had not had a decent he da bap in a long time and there it was on their menu!  Ron of course picked his teriyaki chicken.  Our lunch started with two miso soups, on point.  My he da bap followed shortly there after.  It was served in a large bowl with a bottle of the delicious sauce for me to pour as l wished.  The chunks of sashimi were wonderful and the seafood quality was really nice.  Sashimi was tender not laced with nerves, the color of the fish was natural not imbibed with food colorant.  Below the generous amount of sashimi was my mix green salad then below the green a soft pillow of rice. All three combined made a perfect delectable lunch which l inhaled completely to my surprise.  Ron's chicken teriyaki looked great, the chicken looked really grilled not boiled then just marked.  He praised the teriyaki sauce and the chicken and everything else! We both loved our waiter's great service and warm smiles.  Dishes of other patrons looked amazing too, we will just have to come back.",

The calamari tasted like the frozen stuff you can buy at the grocery store and the rice on the rolls tasted like they had cleaning supply residue on them. It was as if someone had sprayed down the counter with antibacterial cleaning solution and then prepared the rolls. I also have no idea who my tip went to, because three different servers appeared at our table through out the evening. It wasn't even a shift change, they just looked like the were rotating and as a result they kept asking the same questions. You can find way better sushi and atmosphere in the valley for the same price.",

When this popped up on our Yelp vicinity (even though we ended up driving somewhere else looking for this place). It is pretty much across the street from Sushi 101, right by Pho Nat. The place is very new so it was quite empty when I visited, but the food is good. I sat at the sushi bar and ordered all my favorite sushis off of a menu that was dry erasable. They have their menu split from Japanese food first, Korean menu second. I am going back to try the Korean menu but this trip, I ordered just sushi. The sushi was great quality and the portions are HUGE. A little too huge (I had to bite rolls in half just to eat it). And their rice to sushi ratio was waaaay off. Service could use some help but overall, not too shabby.",

I had the bulgogi bibimbap (a dish that I've had many a time and I'm admittedly kind of picky with) and it was really delicious. My sister had a tofu soup and bulgogi and both dishes were really good as well.

As for the food it was a mixed bag. I had the Chicken Teriyaki for lunch which comes with salad and miso soup. When the food arrived the waitress asked if I wanted rice which normally would have been included in any other Japanese restaurant? That seemed a bit weird to me to be asked that.  As for the food I thought that the Chicken Teriyaki was decent however the salad was a huge disappointment. They seem to prepare the salad in advance and then leave it in the fridge which makes the salad extremely cold and there even looked to be some frost on there. Also the salad bowl itself was very cold as well, never seen anything like it before. The miso soup was okay I guess, though it was definitely too salty.  I was really hoping that this restaurant would be better as I do enjoy Japanese food and the location is close to where I live. I'll probably give them another chance but so far my first impressions have been somewhat underwhelming.",

Not only was the costumer service spot on, the energy of the restaurant was cozy and comfortable! The pieces were pretty common sushi rolls between 10-14 dollars (average). I got salmon sashimi and two other rolls (will post pics). Everything tasted so fresh and delicious! The rolls were really good sized! Best part? They gave us a complimentary dessert that was crazy good! Everyone who loves sushi needs to try this out! Beware though, we passed the restaurant a couple times.

    "text": "This is truly awful sushi and service.  Just terrible.  I'm really not that picky, but the meal was bad from start to finish.  We got a couple of waters.  They had this bizarre plastic taste to them.  We got 4 different kinds of sushi rolls.  All of the fish tasted warm and slightly bad.  The rice was not the consistency it should be for sushi, it was almost mush.  The seaweed wrapping on them was at about the level I was able to achieve when I took 9th grade Japanese in high school a decade ago.  I don't know if they have an unqualified chef but the taste of every component was just bad.  If I wanted grocery store sushi I wouldn't have gone to a restaurant.  Despite there being only two other tables with people and 4 or 5 employees standing around talking, it took us a good couple of minutes to flag someone down for our check.  When we did, they didn't even apply the Happy Hour pricing to it.  We had to flag them down a second time to get it corrected.  Seriously, if you want the gas-station-sushi-in-a-restaurant experience go to Sushi 101.  At least their service is faster.  If you want good sushi, go to Sakebombers 5 minutes down the road.  I would not bother with this place and I look forward to whatever restaurant replaces them.  Bad service, bad food, bad atmosphere, just... a truly disappointing experience.  If you have a date with someone you're not into, this is where I would recommend taking them.",

Whenever I go there, its a happy hours .  I usually have Vegas, spicy tuna, and salmon rolls. I just ask them to remove the crab and unagi sauce due to religious reason. I really like the Vegas roll the most especially when they make it spicy for me! Perfect choice. Last check in I tried potato shrimps, was so good with the sauce it comes with.  One thing I noticed is that when you order a meal and you order it again, for the most time it won't taste exactly the same. I mean it's still good, but little bit different. I had this experience for most of sushi places I tried. I will definitely come bake again for rolls!",

That is a BIG no no in my book. It can get really loud and you are packed in like sardines. If you like sushi I recommend it, If your looking for a quit place with wonderful ambiance I would avoid.",

Although I have never tried it I have heard great things about it and always see guests ordering off of that menu every time I have come in. The sushi has always been delivered in a timely manner and I have always had a positive service experience!

Service there is really great, and the Korean food is actually on par.  The only complaint is that their ban chan selection is pretty mediocre.  Usually at Korean restaurants you receive a plethora of ban chan, but here, you only receive 3. They have no problem refilling the ban chan for you though...and I didn't pay attention, but I think it's at no additional charge.  They have a combo meal there that I love which you get a choice of a meat/fish and a hot pot of tofu soup. It fills me up every time!  If I lived closer, I'd frequent this place more often and try their sushi.",

When the food came we were only brought a marginal tasting rice bowl rather than the rice bowl and sushi we ordered. Our waitress was new, and everyone kept coming up to us asking if we needed anything and apologizing. It got pretty annoying. Hopefully you get them on a better day than I did.  Opening a restaurant is hard business. You don't know when demand will spike, which makes it tricky to have the appropriate staff and food on hand.   When you make mistakes due to growth in demand you have to apologize and make amends with your customers: good food, comped meal... Nothing was offered.  It might be worth it it might now, roll the dice yelpers and hopefully you will have a better experience and food than me.  Sincerely,  hairy b.",

The location isn't great but honestly, once you try the food, you won't care. It's very authentic and the owner/other staff and family members were awesome. They offer both a Japanese/sushi menu and a Korean menu. We ordered from both. My boyfriend had the bimbimbop (probably spelled this wrong- opps) which is a Korean dish (I'm learning) and I had the Vegas roll and the Tempe roll. Holy moly, delicious. The bimbimbop is served in a hot skillet and is a combination of veggies, Meat and rice. It was perfect! I wish I had taken pictures of all the dishes because they were presented beautifully and tasted even better.   The others in our group had other speciality rolls and everyone raved about how good they were. I think this is my new favorite sushi spot which is saying a lot because I am a loyal customer and already had my go to sushi spot in Scottsdale.  It was that good.   Check this place out, you absolutely won't regret it. Aside from a happy belly, you will receive wonderful service. The owner even waited on us himself!  Oh yeah, try the ice cream!!!! Can't wait to go back to this place!!!",

Both of us were very satisfied with our orders as well as the yummy side dishes. That afternoon, the service was excellent too. It might have been because it was an early afternoon dinner, so it wasn't busy enough to lose the attention of the servers. Nonetheless, the servers were really friendly and chatted with us a bit. Everything about Gangnam Sushi and Grill was just very satisfying that day. I hope future visits will be just as nice.",

The atmosphere is modern and clean, the service-exceptional, and cuisine-a delightful array of esthetically pleasing Japanese an authentic Korean that lights up your taste buds!   We decided to go with the bibimbap to start with-a fresh hot Korean dish with great flavor and spicy traditional sauce.  The portion was surprisingly huge so we had to set it off to the side to save room for sushi to come. We were also wowed by the size of the sushi once we saw the beautiful volcano roll, which was \"probably the best sushi I've ever had\" said my boyfriend after trying it, to which I also agreed. We both have live in Hawaii for years, and find ourselves frequently disappointed by \"mainland\" sushi restaurants not living up to the famous fresh catch sushi of iron chefs like Morimoto etc. that we had at our fingertips living in the middle of the pacific!   After dinner we got to try the mochi-very good, light dessert option; we got mango and chocolate. Anyways, all in all-it was great and we have now found our new sushi spot!! I must mention again, the wonderful service by all of the staff, even the sushi chef came over and asked how we liked the sushi...and our server held the door on our way out! It was such a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere-like the Asian Cheers! It is so great to see such a good business being introduced into Tempe.  If they keep this up I'm sure they'll be the go-to for many other Tempe dwellers as well! ...their only problem I can foresee might be finding a bigger spot with more tables for patrons once word gets out!",

There are better places to go in Tempe for sushi, but it's not bad, especially if you work at ASU and want a break from MU prepackaged sushi.   The kitchen is a bit slow, but the Korean food is so good, it's a draw.   The biggest negative is the service. I've been here multiple times and while the all-male waitstaff shift is great, the all-female shift is a toss-up. Good luck getting the drink you ordered, or any attention after you've gotten your food. Most of the time the servers were standing around talking or looking at their phones, in full view of the dining room, instead of checking on their tables. We had to walk over to them to ask for our drinks (ten minutes after our appetizer had already arrived), to order dessert, and for our check. Once Gangnam brings all of their staff up to par they will get another star.",

    "text": "Gangnam Sushi is in this random strip mall in Tempe. It's easy to miss. My date got there like fifteen minutes early and ordered for me which I hated because he didn't even get sushi I really liked. The spring rolls were perfectly crispy and I had left over sauce so I dipped the Vegas rolls in it like a glutton and it was great! He ordered a basic crunchy roll and Philly roll so I really wasn't all that impressed. The service was great and you can't go wrong with sake bombs! I think their happy hour is really reasonable.   Date Rating: 1 out of 5, for being slightly catfished. There I am on Bumble and match with Miller. He looks like a bachelorette contestant reject.  Curly blonde hair, pretty smile, washboard abs, and a bio about peace and yoga and whatever. He asks if he can call me and I'm like sure; I love phone calls. We talk about love and relationships and he seems very smart. He asks me out to dinner and I'm like \"Hell yeah\". Then he asks me to pick him up (lol in what world). I tell him it's more comfortable to just meet there. He texts me 15 minutes before the date that he's there and he's already ordered so I step on the gas.  When I get there, I see he has the worst outfit on and this horrid Civil War style hat. My fingers twitch for my Pinterest app so I can redo his whole aesthetic. We start off with sake bombs and he gets chatty. Apparently he was 39 not 29 and going through some \"legal issues\" so he wasn't exactly available to leave his house all the time. In the sweetest way possible I tell him what I'm looking for and he says \"it seems like you want to be wined and dined. I can't give you that but we can order in and I swear I can give you the sex and emotional connection you're searching for\". I could go on a rant about everything wrong with that statement but y'all know, I don't settle. He's going through a very tumultuous time right now and I have no desire to ride shotgun. So I told him it wouldn't exactly work. He says that I was exactly what he wanted and how would I know it wasn't mutual if I didn't give him a shot? Then he looked at me like Cupid had shot him and I got very uncomfortable.   I've never left a restaurant so quickly lmfao. I thanked him for the dinner and deleted his text thread.",

This was seriously some of the tastiest and fresh sushi I've had in a long time, including some of my favorites from back home (Bay area).  Plus it was delivered to my hotel room while I'm in my jammies. Sometimes I truly am amazed at the priviledge of living in a first world country where sashimi delicacies (tako, ikura, tobiko, and unagi) can be delivered to you in your pajamas.   Feeling full and grateful and I will definitely order from them again the next time I'm in town.  (My only hope is that they will find a more sustainable alternative to the styrofoam that my awesome Waikiki roll came in.)",

Gangnam's happy hour is fantastic. All their options clearly tell you what prices they are and are cheap, compared to their prices during normal hours. Even though I wasn't very hungry, I chose the Spider roll and the Vegas roll. I can never finished more than one roll in a single seating, but both looked good, so whatever, right?  Both of the rolls came out in 15 minutes. I tried the Vegas roll and it was definitely fresh and hot from the fryer. It was very good, but the Spider roll was definitely the winner. The crab was so, so crispy. I could totally eat that just on it's own.   I finished the two rolls in 20 minutes. A personal record!",

They had a great selection on their Happy hour menu to include appetizers, sushi rolls, main course options, and drinks.  The food was all awesome. I would say out of everything we ordered I wouldn't get the spicy garlic edamame again. It sounded great but was my least favorite item. Very messy in a red garlic paste of sorts. Okay, just not my favorite.  Sushi was all fresh and tasted great. Very reasonable prices.",

The happy hour menu was just perfect for a late dinner and save money from ordering a full plate. They had great tapas selections from the typical sushi, Japchae to kalbi on the menu. You're not paying for the good quality fish when it comes to HH prices. We had about 6 banchans (side dishes). Our waiter was amazing and so attentive always checking our table refiling the banchans and water. Another excellent alternative if you're craving for late-night Asian food in Tempe.",

That ended tonight with our dinner excursion to Gangnam. Sure it's a little hole in the wall and has some bro-dudes hanging about, but we walked into a Saturday night happy hour and the best sushi and food!! My spouse isn't a fan of sushi so he ordered some spicy pork, chicken katsu and gyoza. I snuck a few bites and it was delicious!! I had a bunch of nigiri and sampled the calamari and spring rolls. So good!! Fresh cuts-- not skimpy! I can't wait to come back even though it's a hike from where we live!!",

I was so shocked of their menu because there are different kinds!   When you get in the parking lot, it doesn't look nice from the outside but inside is pretty and the menu is just WOW! Planning to come back here again!  We had such a great time here. Service is good. Not bad. Not fast and not slow. They only had one sushi chef so it's understandable. The sushi was just soooo delicious! I was surprised that even though the place isn't so fancy looking BUT the food is 5 Star!   We tried Spicy tuna crunchy roll, Paradise roll, Rainbow roll, Futomaki & Unagi roll. The Futomaki was a very interesting sushi! Something we've never tried before but was very delicious though!   Additionally, Our server was pretty nice & attentive!  Thank you, Gangnam! More people need to know about your business and good. It would be nice if you guys find a bigger place and area so the business will go even further and more people will keep coming!   If I could rate 1000000 stars I would! Thank you again!!",

We meant to get two different types of meat, but accidentally got bulgogi for both. I had no reason to regret that, as the bulgogi was amazing! Such a homey, sweet taste done so well was really refreshing and we blew through both the bibimbap and japjae. My friend who isn't typically a fan of the noodle thought it was great; they were well cooked and the noodle/meat/veggie ratio was really generous. The bibimbap was best after a few minutes of sizzling away. Right when the rice starts to brown and get crunchy - mmmmmm- best bites. We hope to be back soon to try the spicy pork bibimbap :)",

Nigiri we had salmon and eel, both excellent (and generous!)!!  Spicy pork was so so. Off the happy hour menu so we weren't expecting much and it was just meh.   Duk Gu, soup with rice cakes, seaweed, eggs and onions was tasty. A little bland but I like salty and my partner likes less, and he thought it was spot on. I'm creating quite the food connoisseur in him.   Like I said, I liked the corner of a strip mall, dive joint appeal set cozily between a hookah lounge and a calzone shop. It fit our mood for a late night snack. Service was ok, little flighty (forgot our drinks, didn't have silverware to eat, etc.) but super kind and laidback.",

We often go with a group and graze on the happy hour menu till we're full.  When you add it up, it's priced about like an all-you-can-eat sushi.  The bento meals are also quite delicious for big appetites.",

Right in front on me Yuck but what had me worried is he never changed his gloves when making my sushi ,,. All he did is rinse the gloves under water and when done making my sushi went back to cutting the meat ... Honestly I'm A fool for staying but I didn't want to just hop up... I'm. Just hoping I don't get sick ... I've had food poisoning before and it was no joke !!!!",

I ordered steamed pork belly (bossam) and cabbage ($20) and my boyfriend had kimchi soondubu with bulgogi combo ($18).  Everything was extremely salty (and I love salty foods)-- so salty to the point that it was almost inedible.  The service was sub-par, granted it was busy, but it took over 20 minutes to get refills on our drinks and another 15-20 minutes to flag down a server for our checks.    I usually give places a second chance before writing a poor review, but I won't be eating here again.  Bottom line: overpriced, poor service, and poor food. Not worth the hype!!",

The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the salad before the meal. The lettuce was not very green and appeared quite white. I think it may have been iceberg lettuce and I may be a bit biased because I am not a big fan of iceberg lettuce for salad. It was also super tiny and to be honest I can't tell if the dressing had little flavor or if there wasn't enough dressing... because it was quite bland. It could have been a fluke. But wow do I recommend the Bibimbap! It was so yummy! I think the prices are okay. Not super cheap but I looked over the lunch specials and those prices definitely appealed to me. The service was wonderful. On both occasions the servers were so nice, helpful, and attentive. I haven't tried the sushi so I can't speak for that but the meals I had were great aside from the salad. Although I would definitely recommend this place. It's not huge but it's very clean and it has nice decor, friendly service, and good food.",

We ordered sushi and teriyaki combo plate and an entree, we did not expect the portions to be this big.  It was all delicious and we were even given complimentary ice cream!   This is a very nice restaurant.  Large food portions, even the sushi was plentiful, along with some tempura vegetables.  The service is exceptional, everyone was friendly and courteous.

Everything was excellent, and the service was prompt and courteous. Not inexpensive, but much better sushi than I have had for the same prices at other places. I would go here over RA, or Kabuki anytime.",

The large moist pieces of fish were very pretty and inviting and that definitely woke up the taste buds. Small but also very tasty piece of rice was just enough to complement the fish. Tempura department can still use some help. The batter was flat and chewy. In my order the onion ring inside was actually more crunchier than that of the batter. It was supposed to be the other way around. Good atmosphere. Definitely would come back for the nigiri and try the rolls next time.",

The girls recommended the regular favorites and I could not be more happy I went with their recommendations! The Bulgogi Bibimbap, or any Bibimbap I'm sure, was amazing!!! The red sauce you add on your own was so good!!! Mmm mmm good!!! Very relaxed atmosphere and again, there's no monetary value on great service!! The food is outstanding! I asked the waitress about every plate coming out of the kitchen because I wanted to try everything!! Definitely going back... Waitress recommended the udon noodles (with the chicken and shrimp (tempura)) and the soft tofu soup w bulgogi on the side!! This is a sushi place, yes, but has so much more to offer! I did have a sushi roll, (I know...all that for one person!! BUT, I brought home about 3/4 of the bibimbap), the spicy tuna w avo and the ahi on top, and it was fresh and tasty! I'm super picky and particular with sushi and this tuna was definitely fresh! Hands down, great food and great service!! Do it!! You won't be disappointed!!",

As one of my friends got to the place before the rest of us, he requested for a corner table by the window since there was only 4 of us and the host said he can't have that table.  My friend told me that there was only 2 other tables that had customers and the host couldn't even give him that table and instead decide to give us the 6 person table.  Makes no sense at all and disrespect by the host.  Anyway, we all got there and the food was OK as we all ordered the Bulgogi entree and nothing was special about it.  Overall it was an OK experience for dinner as I was not pleased how the host can't oblige a customer's request to have a table by the corner.  I wouldn't go back to this place because of the way how my friend was treated as a customer and this place doesn't have the better food than other places I have tried.  Sorry Gangnam, you have lost yourself 4 customers that won't come back.",

Just small things all night, forgotten waters, and it took us asking for our bill more than once to final get it.  The redeeming reason they still got 4 stars was the food.

While we usually eat with lettuce wraps, gojujang, and bean paste. Our waiter has no clue what we were asking for. Seems odd as these are normal request we make elsewhere and have never had a problem. This shows lack of knowledge of the food they serve. Disappointing.

After discovering the Hwe Dup Bap here (mixed Korean sushi rice) I don't get anything else. It's a bit pricey at $16 but the value is there with a ton of fish mixed with rice, veggies, and chogochujang (Red Pepper Paste w/ Vinegar). It doesn't look pretty but it sure is a tasty bowl of goodness.  The Japanese side of the menu is decent but I found it not as strong in comparison to the Korean offerings. Sushi is average for the price though the nigiri slices here are quite phat. I couldn't put my finger on it but the sushi rice here falls flat compared to other places and the nigiri comes sans wasabi. Gyoza here is cooked perfectly and worth a try in its perfectly fried glory. Tempura didn't fare as well as the veggies were heavily breaded taking away from the shrimp.  It's pricey but the location and quality Korean keeps me coming back. (7 visits and counting!) Love the ambiance and music.  All in all, Gangnam is a great addition to the other Korean places near campus like Paradise Hawaiian and Grilled Ave.",

The roll in of itself was huge for the price and it tasted great the tuna was fresh with a good amount of spice. Then came this massive thing loaded with veggies meat and topped with an egg. If that wasn't enough they brought a great assortment of pickled items to accompany everything, kimchi, fish cakes, bean sprouts omelette, cole slaw. All tasted great as well. We had a great time trying something new the only negative thing I can think of is maybe a forewarning for the massive amount of food they let me order.",

I heard the sushi was good and the Korean food was good so I tried it. I liked it. I will have to say that the Korean stuff is more the pricey side while the Japanese food is about what you would find elsewhere.  I ordered sushi and Korean food. The sushi was good. The Korean tofu soup was even better. It had a lot of flavor and way more than the usual ones I find at other Korean restaurant. One thing about the staff is that they are so happy. Why are they so happy? I don't know. But they were happy and enthusiastic. If only they weren't so new and forgetful of things that you request.  Well food and service was good and the decor was very intimate so I say it's good place to bring friends and dates! There's very few Korean places in Tempe so this place is definitely a plus to the area.",

Although the shopping plaza itself is old, the decor of the restaurant is modern and hip, with a sophisticated flair.  We came here around 7 on a Friday night and it was packed! All the tables were occupied but there was still sushi bar seating available. The waiters all greeted us warmly and we decided to wait at the sushi bar area until a table opened up.  Once we procured a table, we browsed through the extensive menu and ordered enough food for a small army (What can I say, my eyes were bigger than my stomach!). We had the super Spiderman roll, bulgolgi bimbimbap, seafood pancake, jap chae, and spicy pork. Our starting banchan was a threesome of kimchi, sprouts, and fish cake.   The roll was huge, and filled with soft shell crab, shrimp, and veggies. The jap chae was excellent, filled with a lot of veggies and very tender, marinated beef. The noodles were cooked perfectly. The bimbimbap was a huge portion, beautifully arranged. I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more caramelization of the rice on the bottom of the stone bowl. I love the crispy rice bits mixed in with the rest of the rice, veggies, and meat in this dish. The spicy pork was also very tender and flavorful, but not exceedingly spicy. The seafood pancake was good, but could have used a bit more cooking to crisp up the outside for more texture balance.  Service was a bit uneven as it took a long time to actually order, but once our order was placed we were checked on frequently and with very friendly staff.   Overall, this is a great place to dine, and even more alluring since they are open late on Friday and Saturday!",

    "text": "I find it hard to find great sushi or korean places in Arizona and was interested to see how Gangnam would live up to serving both! The rave reviews on a new establishment was definitely something that needed to be checked out.  The menu here has good variety with a good assortment of rolls, nigiri as well as Korean stews, casseroles and hot stone rice pots (i.e. bibimbap). However, with an appetite on the smaller end I decided to go for their Sake Bomb and an order of Vegetable Tempura.  The dishes come out with sides (banchan) typically served with Korean meals. Though it isn't the full array of 6, the sides consisted of fish cake, potato and Kim Chi. The fish cake and potato aren't the best I've ever had and seemed to be lacking in flavor. I did love the Kim Chi though, it's tart and spiciness was delicious! As for the Sake Bomb, it was a roll laid flat with Salmon, Spicy Tuna and Avocado. The freshness of the fish is okay and I found that their sushi is on the warmer side, not cold slices of fish (finally). However, it isn't amazing. The tempura was large in portion and had a good crust, but typical in flavor.  Pricing is on the pricier side as with most Japanese or Korean restaurants. Sushi roll was about $12 and tempura was about $6.  Judging by the service you can tell that the establishment is new and working out the kinks, however all the servers were genuinely friendly, sought out answers to questions and forewarned that it was their first day. Though a bit spotty in forgetting certain things, they were attentive, refilled waters and made sure to do frequent check ups on customers. The interior is clean and modern.  Definitely would like to come back to try their Korean dishes and to eat more of their amazing Kim Chi!",

    "text": "I went here with a few of the Asian crew and people have been telling me good things about it.   My friend was telling me about their awesome Tofu soup so I got the mixed option and a side of Kalbi for about $20 dollars. Luckily, I have very generous friends so I even tried some of their food.  Tofu Soup- Very hearty and full of surprises. I ordered my Tofu soup the spiciest but it wasn't really that spicy. In the tofu soup is soft tofu, shrimp, ground meat, some clams, and a nice uncooked egg that they plot right into the bowls before serving. Since the soup arrives boiling, the egg gets cooked rather fast. In general, the soup was very hearty and tastes like a typical tofu soup with a lot of red pepper paste (a Korean specialty). The friend who invited me here raves about their soup and I agree, I would say if you had to go here, get this soup because it's unique and they do it well.  Kalbi- For those that don't know, Kalbi is horizontally cut thin slices of pork ribs. Very good but it's a pretty small plate. The meat was cooked a little bit less than what I'm used to, where the meat is slightly charred, but overall, it was pretty good quality kalbi.  Bulgogi- Bulgogi is pretty much marinated beef. In all honesty, it is not my favorite type of Korean beef as if not cooked right, it tastes like wet, salty paper bags all scrunched up together. The bulgogi my friend had was pretty dry, just the way I like it. Nothing special if you haven't had bulgogi before but it wasn't something to write about.  Bibimbap- Layer in a huge cast iron pot, my friend ordered this one and it was a beautiful presentation. I tried a little bit when he mixed it up and it sure tasted like Bibimbap! Again, nothing special, but it's a very big portion which is a plus to me!  Sushi- The sushi's pretty average here. Apparently, there are a few Korean sushi joints that add rare thin slices of beef on top of the sushi. The specialty rolls tasted of good quality but my only complaint was the salmon roll, which I found the rice to be a little bit overcooked. Sashimi (Tuna) - I snagged one off of a friend's plate. I never order Sashimi in Arizona because it literally can't compare to California. The Sashimi I find in Phoenix is either too soft (bad thaw process) or too hard (wrong cut). This time, it was too hard. The texture, which I find is the most important part of Sashimi, was like eating hard plastic.  Ambiance Gangnam Sushi and Grill reminds me of a hip noodle shop in my college. As I sometimes mention, the \"color\" of the restaurant was black, at least going there at night. You might disagree with me, because there is a giant white, wavy wall that has LED lights on one side. However, the tables were black and the bar opposite of the white wall was of granite color. Maybe they were trying to do the whole Yin Yang deal.   Most Korean restaurants give metal chopsticks (someday I am going to find a reason for this) but this restaurant gives out wooden chopsticks. I guess since this is technically a hybrid Korean/ Sushi restaurant, that's ok. I am always partial to black plastic chopsticks and I'll make an argument that I would like those instead of wooden ones but this is a very minor complaint.  Cost About $20 dollars a meal. Decently expensive but this is comparable to most Korean restaurants in Phoenix. This restaurant focuses on the fact that you will get less food the higher quality the meal is. This of course, makes sense. Raw tuna costs a lot more than cabbage. Point being, if you order a meat plate, you will get more bulgogi than kalbi at the same price. If you're into the quality of the food, then this is a perfectly fine thing to do. For one, you're eating high quality food, and consuming less calories. I would say the best bang for your buck is the Bibimbap. Looks beautiful and can feed a horse.  Selection Gangnam has an impressive array of both Korean and Sushi options. I think if I was a regular, I would never get Sushi here because it's just so common. However, the sushi here isn't bad, it's the same as everywhere else. The drinks menu is plentiful with a lot of Asian beer, wines, cocktails, and of course... soju...  Overall Tucked away in a corner strip mall, Gangnam is a pretty nice gem. It has a mix of authentic Korean food and the sushi is alright. I don't think I'd ever order sushi here because the Korean food is legitimate enough to eat on its own but everyone loves sushi so it's a good move for the owners to put it there.",

We will definitely be back again and again.",

Collectively my group and I ordered the gal I, bibimbap, soondubu and the Vegas roll and the super Spider-Man roll. Super Spider-Man was by far the favorite, and the galbi was on point. Bibimbap could use salt and the soondubu a bit more flavor, but that's just me based on authentic Korean food. Great attentive service and great selection of food. You'll definitely find something yummy and have a great time. Will return, with more people too!",

We had the spicy tuna and the spider rolls - both were about $11 and had legit pieces of tuna and soft shell crab in them.  Most sushi places will skimp and will fill their rolls with rice and veggies to hide the sliver of fish in them but not here!  Loved the rolls.  We also had the budaechigae (kimchi stew).  This was also huge.  We shared it with our whole table and still had about half of it left to take home.  Absolutely packed with sausage and bacon...which any korean will tell you is the key.  Highly recommend you get this if you're going with a party of 4-5.  A great appetizer or complement to the sushi.    The kalbi (korean short ribs) were my favorite part of the meal.  Melt-in-your-mouth tender, marinated perfectly, cooked perfectly...as good as any kalbi I've had in LA.    All in all, the food is delicious, portions are great, and atmosphere is comfortable.  And the owner was really cool - I saw him welcome every guest personally and was constantly walking around making sure everyone was happy.  A must-eat if you're in the mood for sushi, korean, or both around campus.",
