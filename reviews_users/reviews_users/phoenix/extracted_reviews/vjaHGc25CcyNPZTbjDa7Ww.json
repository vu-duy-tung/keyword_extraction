The breakfast sandwich was particularly incredible and I also highly recommend the Monte Cristo (a breakfast sandwich with French toast and the best special sauce I never would have guessed would be great). You have to try this place. Great atmosphere. You can easily dress casually or dress up for a party. The service here is great. I cannot recommend it enough!!",

Wasn't impressed with the food at all, but loved the bloody Mary bar. Very fun to be able to make your own drink for $4. Got the daily flatbread and it wasn't very good. Hardly any chicken, but smothered in more than enough cheese to make hit rock bottom :/ Didn't hurt that our server Christopher was fun to look at and a really good server :)",

Very laid back atmosphere. Weekend brunches also have good discounts on beer and a bottomless mimosa special.   The bacon was something that stood out to me. I liked it so much I even ordered extra as a side.   Downsides are slow service and I think the food is a bit overpriced.",

What a disappointment!! The biscuits were like scones, the gravy was like hummus, the egg looked fake and I got 4 little breakfast potato squares with a mound of bell pepper and onions, oh and my food was COLD and the \"gravy\" covered 1/2 of ONE of my biscuits, so the other biscuit and a 1/2 was bare and hard with a hockey puck feel. I had 1 mimosa and a bloody mary from the bloody mary bar. Mimosa came from a pre-made batch, so I couldn't ask for a little less juice (I get heartburn from too much OJ) and the Bloody Mary bar was extremely overwhelming. Why so many bottles (like 40) of hot sauce? That makes no sense!! 1 star for the bacon. Grabbed 5 pieces of those bad boys to make up for the crappy breakfast I was eating.   Won't be returning.",

I went total gluttony overboard and I have ZERO regrets. Edamame was fantastic. Their cheesy tator tots that tasted like God hand rolled them himself were a flavor party in my mouth with every delicious savory both (slight drooling happening), we had the whitefish special and killed that in about 3.5 minutes. My boo had the short rib tacos as well...he murdered those as well...no remaining meat was found anywhere. We also had shrimp pad Thai and the mac& cheese. Yes , this was ALL consumed among two ppl. We finished  everything besides the two pastas which we took home and thoroughly enjoyed the next day. Craft beers, and cocktail drinks were happily consumed as well.  The food is of really good quality here. I left feeling full but not the run down I need a nap bcus I cant move full. I was rlly happy with this restaurant and I will be back in the near future...the menu does change as well!!  p.s great service!",

I loved my Coronado Cup & the pork flatbread on special that night. First thing I had here that I really, really, really, enjoyed. The hubs liked the burger previously. Had the guacamole/chips late night menu & it was delish.  That's why the 3 stars. The food, cocktails, patio & service by almost everyone is great! My only bitch is a big one in my book & it resides with the long dark haired bartender. I've had him a few times now & caters to his buddies/co-workers & local bar staff that visit him late night. . My beer was EMPTY for 13 minutes while he made shots for his buddies/co-workers & practiced drinks on them.13 minutes  for a beer this is ridiculous on a Sunday evening at 10:45 p.m. with an empty patio & restaurant & an almost full bar. The only reason I timed it was because he's done this before to us & frankly I was curious. He mixed drinks next to us & never turned his pretty lil' dark long haired head around to serve us. No joke! He's the only bartender/server that I've had issue with at all here but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Ruins the experience completely for me. Not because I'm so important but because everyone else in the restaurant is that much better... There are too many gastro pubs around downtown to darken the door of one that doesn't treat everyone equally with great service. This bartender when he's paying attention to you is really good. He knows what he's doing, is quick & has a lot of personality. But when he's sidetracked by friends/co-workers don't expect a thing. Not even a beer refill cuz that sadly isn't happening. :(",

Our party of 8 was accommodated right away at a big table outside with plenty of shade (they gave us an extra umbrella) and greeted with water promptly. Our server (Stephen) took great care of us! He was very speedy and attentive (never let our water glasses go below halfway) and recommended the Corned beef hash to me which I LOVED. yummy chopped hash with hollandaise on poached eggs (my favorite). Best part: bottomless mimosas and $4 bloody Mary's you can make yourself with plenty of options. I also appreciate the manager checking on us and making sure were ok. He gave us a free chocolate mousse/graham cracker merengue dessert when we finished which was just the cherry on top To the perfect brunch. Jazz trio playing outside was a nice touch. If I wasn't on vacation in Phoenix for the week id be frequenting this place for their brunch and cocktails. Thank you to The Vig for creating an awesome experience.",

Whether it's a dinner date, meeting up friends, this spot caters to all.  The nachos are a great appetizer to get when you're with a group, be careful because you will get stuffed before a meal, it's a big portion. It's a great ambiance and if you can, choose the outside seating.  The staff here are all really cool and fun to talk too, everyone seems to be personable. When you're done with dinner, play some cornhole with friends and enjoy the atmosphere.",

I will echo the other reviews in saying the aesthetic is wonderful- gorgeous patio and bar area, views of downtown and twinkle lights.   Unfortunately our service was sub par. I don't want to completely call out our server on here but her name started with \"R\". Our group was mellow- a few alcoholic drinks, and not everyone ordered food. After ordering the drinks she told us when she came back we would \"talk food\". The drinks took 15+ minutes, and when she came back she didn't stop long enough to take anyone's order. We waited another 10 minutes to order, while she walked around and helped the neighboring tables. Finally she took orders and the food took a decent amount of time. Truthfully it was just disappointing- there was no reason a couple Sangrias( red and white were delicious) and a beer should take that long. Also I don't know why she continued to not make taking 12 peoples orders a priority.   The food was good, we had roasted Brussel sprouts which I felt were a little undercooked. I had the flat bread which wasn't stellar, however the people around us loved their burgers, and the pork belly and watermelon.  After all was said and done our server charged us an auto grat fee which explained why she didn't feel the need to make us a priority.   Kind of had high expectations for this place and it was a bummer to have a lame experience- I think i will make another appearance some other time with a smaller group.",

The outdoor setting is comfortable and the staff has always been super nice and wonderful.  They also have free WiFi and sometimes it's nice to sit in a chair with a glass of wine and I can sit and use my tablet or read. I will always be back and chilling because who can deny a mac n cheese craving?",

When we have visitors from out of town this is the first place we take them wether it's a daytime lunch or a nighttime dinner and drinks!  We've had the short rib tacos, the Mac n cheese (best in town), burger, to name a few. Recently (in Sept) we went with the kids before Kidz Bop and I ordered the hummus with grilled veggies and added the chicken. Holy moly! I have to say I am not a hummus kind of girl but this hummus is AMAZING! It was so good 1- I didn't share it and 2- I went back this month and ordered it again. It's big enough to eat as a meal for one to eat. So this has now become my first favorite meal here. Followed by the creamiest and full of flavor Mac n cheese. Followed by the short rib tacos. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 not 5 is because the last time we went (1PM) wasn't so busy and we had to wait a while before anyone waited on us. But other than that.. I'll see you again soon Vig!",

The servers were a little slow but we had a larger party so it's understandable to some extent. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and it was HUGE, I would definitely recommend sharing it with someone; i ate half. The sandwich came with some good home fry type potatoes and of course I was sipping some $3 mimosas. The atmosphere was very nice and upbeat, the patio is the only way to go IMO since it is very beautiful, spacious and airy. They did have a BYO Bloody Mary bar and I'd like to try that next time. The server didn't offer it to us so I was a little bummed I was already on my mimosa train when I found out, oh well next time!  Anyway, my friends loved the pozole (you can order big or small btw) and green chicken enchiladas. My mom ordered the hangover helper and it was DELISH! I'll definitely be back! Keep up the Great work Vig Fillmore, it doesn't go unrecognized!!",

It's located on the corner or fillmore and 4th ave and blends perfectly into the neighborhood.  We were greeted at the door and choose to sit at the outdoor bar/patio area. It has a great open, yet comfy feel with lounge chairs, high tops, and regular tables surrounding the bar. A fireplace and outdoor games also dot the landscape. A real cool vibe. We sat and drinks came quickly. The menu was not large but, had a very diverse selection. Burgers, mac n cheese, tacos, salmon, etc. We opted for the chicken nachos and blackened fish tacos. Nachos were piled high with guac, blk olives, cheese, refried beans and salsa - very good! The four street fish tacos also hit the spot with a little heat and a fantastic crema on the side. Staff was friendly and attentive. Overall, we loved this place and are eager to stop back and relax by the fireplace, have a few drinks and enjoy the evening.",

(sorry forgot his name) :(.  It was almost scary how good he was at his job...LOLOLOLOL!!! Right when I was down to 1 spoonful left of my dessert he appeared (seemingly out of a secret floor hatch) to ask if he could take the plate away. Talk about customer service and attentiveness. Maaaaaannnnnn somebody earned their tip tonight!!!  I kind of don't want to visit the others Vig locations cuz I don't want anything to mess up the experience I had during tonight's visit.  For food all I ordered was dessert and a drink. The Moscow Mule made with Tito's went down real smooth. For dessert I had the mason jar mud pie. Usually, desserts tend to be overly sweet, but this was not. It had the perfect ratio of ice cream to chocolate cake to whipped cream and begs you to come back for more until the last spoonful passes your lips.  Even though I didn't order an entree I can say the sweet potato fry and stole from my friends plate was fantastic and whatever dip they serve with it needs to be bottled and sold separately. I also took a big whiff of my other friend's pozole (the red one) and it smelled amaaaaaazzzzing. Next time I will definitely order that soup!  All in all our group enjoyed ourselves and plan to visit again soon.",

The setting was really nice with high walls for privacy, a nice fireplace burning and string lights running above (would look great at night). I went with a bacon Bleu cheeseburger and my friend had the tacos, both were great. I saw some hot wings and nachos delivered to tables near by that immediately let me know I'd be returning to try. Good drink menu as well with a nice \"locals only\" menu from 12-4. Overall really was diggin my first trip to The Vig. Check it out when your downtown",

Between the fatty meat, the melted cheese and greasy sauteed onions, the oil drenched white bread that was fried, and the wierdly seasoned french fries, I totally expect that I might have to have my gall bladder removed tomorrow. Made the mistake of not getting the side salad so there wasn't a fresh vegetables on that plate. Too greasy to enjoy, but I ate it because I was starving, and the server was like a humming bird on crack who would ask how things were and then was gone before you could even open your mouth to talk...so I didn't send it back...but I should have. Not feelin the love....",

The patio filled up while we were there so clearly they do a lot of brunch business, but you wouldn't know it from the lack of service we received. Our server appearances were few and far between. I was able to at least get a beer, but the food we ordered arrived at various different times and she never returned to see if anyone wanted anything else. Having just finished running 13.1 miles, I wasn't ready to order immediately and our server never checked to see if I wanted to order later. Considering how long it took for everyone else's food to come out, it wouldn't have been worth it anyway. I've enjoyed visits to the other locations of the Vig, but this one was very disappointing and I would not return.",

    "text": "My husband works downtown so we decided to meet here for an impromptu date night. First off, I love that downtown Phoenix is become a bit more urban and developed as far as the night life and culinary scene goes. We were there on a Thursday around 7ish and were told the wait for the patio was about 30 minutes. I liked that they took our cell phone # and would text us instead of carrying around a beeper from the 80's. We found a single seat around the crowded yet pleasant outdoor bar. The crowd was very diverse ranging from the plentiful down town ASU students to {on the younger more good looking} middle aged couples such as ourselves to a handful of good looking, distinguished business men.   My first impression however was to be completely and almost ridiculously ignored by a young {blonde} female bartender whom I can only assume was at the tail end of a very long, very bad day. She walked by us scowling several times  with a sideways glance and perceptibly spiteful, served three different groups of people who had arrived there after us. After about 15 minutes (it wasn't that busy) a very nice young man took our order. He took the time to ask me a few questions about my taste preferences in wine and quickly poured me a sample of chardonnay which I loved.  He poured a beer for my husband and even asked me to \"say when\" as he poured my wine.   We were seated at a small patio table under strung lights on a faux grass lawn. Our server, another very pleasant and well informed young man immediately greeted us and ran over the fairly unimpressive menu. He \"highly recommended the house made guacamole\" and so we ordered it. It was good, but nothing to write home about and extremely over salted, and I love salt.   I ordered the salmon which I am always apprehensive to do because most venues overcook it to death and my husband ordered some sort of burger. Our waiter was more than pleasant when I asked to substitute the also highly recommended soba noodles with seasonal grilled veggies.   Our order came out in a near fashionable time while we enjoyed quizzing each other with the Trivial Pursuit deck of cards that were set on the table. Our drinks were refilled in perfect timing. My salmon was cooked almost perfectly, no complaints except it was just a tad overcooked and lacking any flavor other than a hint of lemon and a bit too much oil. The grilled veggies, the same, good but too oily and no flavor. My husband said the burger was \"good\".   Over all, nice atmosphere, decent food at a decent price. Good place for happy hour if you don't get the cranky blonde bartender and might be more fun with a small group of friends if your not crunched for time. Will optimistically try this place again.",

We sat outside as the weather was still really nice.  Not too crowded.  Comfortable seating.  Service was great.  The warmed soy garlic edamame were awesome.  I had the Royal Blush cocktail which was really refreshing. For dinner he had the Pozole and I had the Poke Bowl. Both meals were amazing.  Lots of flavor.  The Tuna for the Poke was super fresh and tasty - melted in my mouth. We were full and had leftovers of Pozole the next day.  No room for dessert but the sounded awesome.  Can't wait to come back.",

We went again today and joined the wait time on yelp. When we joined it said 15 - 20 minutes but when we arrived 15 minutes later they had an hour and half wait and they recommended using the yelp wait list to the group before us but when we walked up we had the same wait time. Just seems like it is all a fraud.",

We sat out on the patio, at the bar, and it was very pleasant and easy to talk amongst ourselves. Will definitely go back.",

    "text": "I cannot get over the sweet potato fries and their paired curry aioli sauce. It's genius, addictive, and such a balanced pairing with the sweet potato and salty curry creaminess. But starting from the beginning..  The Vig is a picturesque little restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. They have a weekend-only brunch menu, happy hour, and discounted burger Mondays after 6pm. The ambiance is casual but intimate, with nicely dimmed lights inside complete with table and booth seating. Sometimes there can be a bit of a wait, but there's a cushioned seating area outside for lounging.  Classic burger with sweet potato fries: The classic burger here is impressive, and of course the sweet potato fries pairing is a must. The burger is comprised of a juicy patty, lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickled on a toasty bun. Sides include fries, sweet potato fries, mac and cheese or roasted brussels sprouts for an extra charge. I always get my burger medium rare, and it's always been cooked well and well-seasoned.  Guacamole and chips: The guacamole was freshly made, and I really liked the chunks of fresh avocado and fragrant lime. I almost felt like there was a tad too much lime because of how acidic the guacamole was, but this is just personal preference since my friends loved the acidity and wanted even more. I wasn't s fan of the chips; they were unevenly made with some being super thin and others being really thick.   Sliders: Though supposedly just smaller versions of the burger, I heavily prefer the regular burger to these sliders. I felt that there was too much bread for the small amount of patty, and the buns were dense and a little hard. There wasn't very much filling, so I felt like I was chewing bread and cheese most of the time. That being said, the happy hour price for three sliders and a huge mound of fries is pretty generous.  Blackened fish tacos: The fish was cooked well in these tacos, and there was a tangy slaw on the bottom that was a nice textural contrast to the fish and soft tortilla. The green sauce (jalapeno guacamole perhaps?) had a really strong kick, so it's a good choice for those who like some spice in their tacos. I did find the tortillas a bit undercooked and soggy, especially with the two stacked together, but overall these were also a nice item included in the happy hour menu.  I haven't tried too many drinks here, but I did like the Hoegaarden beer. It's one of the lightest yet more flavorful beers I've had, and it went down super smooth and was a nice pairing with both the burger and the fish tacos.   I think the overall food here would probably be a 3.5star, but coupled with the happy hour, ambiance, and those sweet potato fries, I'll definitely be a return customer.",

    "text": "The big was awesome! It's located in an artsy District downtown and is on a little side street so you may miss the turn if you're not paying attention.  The parking is complementary valet so be sure to tip!  Location is really beautiful first thing you see is the outdoor seating with headlamps and a grassy area that looks like it's for games.  We ordered a chicken nachos appetizer for the table, which was really good and packed with flavor but it was one of those situations where once you eat the top layer with all the toppings there's nothing left underneath but at least they give you a side of delicious salsa to dip the extra chips in.  For my lunch entree I chose to get the blackened fish tacos and let me tell you they were delicious. Pre-warning if you don't like spicy you should probably not get these because they have a slight kick. They came with a spicy slaw,  pico de gallo, and tomatillo-avocado salsa these fish tacos were perfect because all the condiments complement each other and they give you 4 so by the 3rd one I was already super full but you can't complain about getting more so I won't.  The best part is why you wait for your food come out they have trivial pursuit on the table for everyone to play and it includes three different versions like totally 80s, 90s, and I forget the other two because we were all too young to answer any of the questions but it was really funny we had a great time. I look forward to going back whenever I'm in Phoenix.   The four stars is only because we had to keep asking the waiter for extra everything and he would side eye us like we had plenty and didn't want to bring it. It wasn't a big deal more funny actually... But, not when you're hungry so.",

I stopped by at the Vig after a hike up Camelback... Well, quarter of a hike because it was too hard. But the point is I was ready for something hearty & delicious ... And this place delivered with not only flavors, but people and service. The restaurant is cozy, and with a lovely patio. We were seated next to our personal heater, so that hit the spot. I had a deal from Localdines and it was accepted for drinks, and on a Sunday evening, so that was a great plus. Waiter & manager were nice and attentive,  and the drinks were great. What else can I ask for?",

I ordered my black and bleu burger medium and was promised that it would have pink in the middle. It was cooked all the way through and terribly dry. Couldn't find the bleu cheese or the bbq sauce.  The side of roasted sweet potatoes was great as were the onion rings my partner had. The waitress was slow and unattentive. I was so disappointed and most likely won't be going back.",

Delicious pineapple passion fruit mimosas and a giant warm, melt in your mouth cinnamon roll with homemade cream cheese icing....are you drooling yet??? It was like Grandmas homemade!!! Definitely will come back and we also met the manager Chris and he was so pleasant to talk to and seemed genuinely interested in our experience there. Even the bus boys were sooo pleasant and helpful and working hard to keep everything running efficiently! I just wish I had one closer to my house in the NW Phoenix area Well done The Vig Fillmore!",

I don't know what they're doing but whatever you do DO NOT get the poke bowl! Was up all last night vomiting. Not to mention my husband ordered pad Thai with shrimp and they brought it out with chicken, so hey had to remake it so he was just sitting there while I ate my food (which is good looking back on it, at least he didn't eat the poke bowl too, then we'd both have food poisoning). Then they were going to take one of his cocktails off our tab due to the mixup and forgot to. I'm never eating there again. Still feel like complete crap and I'm hoping I don't throw up again today!",

The patio is big and there is always seating around the bar or on one of the big lawn tables.   The servers are friendly and quick to clean up the tables. The happy hour food (especially the hummus, wings and sliders) are a must try. They valet, which is nice because it is hard to find parking downtown.  Uptown still holds my heart, but this is a close second.",

I ordered Salmon and it was delish! So many different flavors in the plate, I wanted seconds, even thirds!   Half way through my plate, the host came to us and asked if we wanted to be seated at a table and we kindly said no we were fine and she walked away. Did not apologize for the long wait time.

I got some champagne drink that was just ok.  Once seated we ordered 2 apps the calamari, not bad but just basic and over fried.  The second app was spinach dip that was pretty tasty and had some heat.     My main dish was the tuna salad, and the tuna was sour! So gross made me gag rotten fish ewwww.  The chef said that sometimes happens ummmm ewwww.  I sent it back and got the beat salad, this supposed beat salad had a total of 8 beat chunks in it.  Not sure you can call it a beat salad just call it a salad with a few beats and a lump of goat cheese.  My husband got the chrizo burger and said it was amazing but I did not taste it so I cannot judge it.  I did try the mac n cheese super boring nothing special about it tastes like a super charged kraft box mix.     Did not bother with dessert.",

We came out as a get together on 8/25/18 just to get treated amazing by our waitress Rikki and bartender Jenna but terrible by the manager Leah who was working.  We are regulars here , at least here 3+ times a week . We come for the friendly employees, clean restaurant, and always a good time . The service we received tonight by the manager Leah put a real bad taste in our mouthes and I will make sure to call ahead and ask which manager will be working before taking the drive . I am 6 months pregnant, Sitting outside , Leah is walking around I stopped her 3+ times asking for more water and never received it . Thankfully Rikki is on top of her game and always on her toes and came to the rescue . Not only did Leah ignore me for more water, but when she brought my food to me she did a \"drive by\" drop off.  Didn't ask if everything else was fine or if we needed anything . After finishing my meal i attempted to stop her to grab my plate and once again ignored but she stopped at every other table but ours. As a manager I expect better service from them than your own waitress and bartenders doesn't matter regulars or not . This is definitely something that needs to be brought to higher up attention and taken care of . We love the Vig Filmore and the vibes you guys have let's just get everyone on the same page and make sure there is always enough staffing to cover what is needed and if Leah will be on the floor helping out she is being diverse , and fair to everyone!",

Heard good things about this place, their food, cool place downtown blah blah blah. But can only judge from my experience which was appauling.  We checked online to see they were open till 2am. It was 9 o clock and we were absolutely starving from filming in the desert all day. The band I had been shooting were from out of town and we're excited to experience what Phoenix had to offer.   We were greeted by no one and sat ourselves down. Our server took about 20 minutes so as it was cold I stopped an employee and asked if we could sit in the indoor area. The guy didn't say much other than 'sometimes it's private' went to check for me to never return.  Eventually our server arrived and told us that they were stopping food in 10 minutes and shutting the whole place in 20 minutes. Despite their listed times online and despite the fact their was still quite a lot of people still dining and drinking.  Obviously disappointed we decided to go with a drink before taking off for some food. The server recommended a beer for us only to return after a while to say they don't have it. Then again recommending another beer to then return saying they don't have that either. There was a group of about 10 of us and everyone was frustrated as we were struggling to actually pin down the server due to not knowing stock. So me and a friend went to the bar just to grab a drink and chat about some business whilst everyone else was trying to get served. To my disbelief the barman refused to serve me as we had sat down outside even though noone had been served yet for sometime. After pissing us off he reluctantly said he would by which time we were done with the place.  Absolutely terrible organisation and service. The staff here couldn't tell their arse from their elbow. Me and my friends will not be coming here again.",

I guess I'll start with the positives: our server, Cory, was great. Very friendly, able to answer menu questions and provide good recommendations (the chicken enchiladas, her suggestion, were easily the best thing we ordered), prompt service start to finish.   Unfortunately, with the notable exception of the enchiladas, the food was basically bad diner qual. The ambiance was...bro crossed with drunk-old-white-women. The parking situation was a nightmare. But the lowlight was the Bloody Mary experience.   The Bloody Mary bar seemed awesome when we walked in, but when we got there to build ours, we found half the items were empty (plus, sweet bonus, the manager standing nearby twiddling his thumbs seemed to be deeply and morally offended when I asked about restocking some of the more crucial items...like Bloody Mary mix).   Overall, as a former server, I came away pleased, but that's because I'm pretentious about service and our server killed it. The rest of the group was disappointed, and I can't imagine any of them going back.",

I have a little bike business downtown and we frequently bring guests to them before concerts at Comerica Theater. Over the past several months, there has been a noticeable decline in service. I have received several complaints. The funny thing is I wrote about this on The Vig's Instagram page today and it was removed. One weekend, my team brought 17 couples to The Vig. These were people attending a concert and did not know where to eat. They would not have been to The Vig if we did not recommend and deliver them.  Some of the staff has a serious attitude problem. The manager appears aloof and detached. She floats about and does not pitch in to help her team. She needs to be removed. Wait times have increased, food delivery times have slowed to a crawl and my reputation for recommending them is taking a hit with every couple I bring there.  I would say stay away until they get their act together. A management change at the Fillmore location is long overdue.",

It was my first time there, i understand being a server is a very hard job as i am in the customer service industry as well but this was terrible! the server was a female i did not get her name but she seemed very annoyed and short with us as soon as we got there. She never refilled water or asked if we needed anything else she even ruined our friends birthday surprise cake by asking about it out loud when we had already said it was a surprise.She never came back to check on us so we had to ask for our tabs, if we where shady people we could have left without paying and no one would have noticed .I was completely confused the reviews are so great but service was just terrible. We all could have left a huge tip for her if she would of just been nice and actually served us.",

Try that first.  Staff were very friendly, genuine, and helpful.  Service was well timed.   I ordered the fish tacos and they were very good. Would have been nice to have a few tortilla chips with it. I loved the tart green sauce on the side and would have used that as salsa, too! Friend had their pad Thai, which she LOVED.   This is a good, mid-priced place for lunch. In the cooler months, their outdoor bar is a great place for happy hour.",

The nachos were perfectly proportioned and savory. The chicken was not dry at all. Our waitress also waited patiently enough to take our orders. Once we were ready to order, our food came out as we wrapped up our appetizer. Our table ordered two orders of the hot wings (sweet chili, regular), two orders of chicken fried sandwich and one The Vig burger. All of the food was great, warm and perfect. The servings are pretty big and enough to share. Next time I'll split a burger. I was also surprised with a nice chocolate cake with ice cream. The staff was very nice to acknowledge my bday on the way out. The service was amazing. Can't wait to come back for happy hours.",

I told them not to, because I ate the fish- but they did, so I appreciate that.  Server never smiled once after we told her and showed her the grease.  Friend ordered a rib eye. Sure looked like a New York from where I was sitting. Not like any rib eye I've ever seen. Should have taken a photo.   No misters outside? It's summertime in Phoenix. Miserably hot in the best seating area- the courtyard. Or maybe they just had them turned off on a Friday night.",

We opted for the booth area near the bar. It's a very trendy place with low lights and TVs. Our waitress was very friendly and made good recommendations. I went with the sliders and an old fashioned. My drink was made perfectly and my food was pretty good too!  What made this experience specifically important was a small mishap (no fault of the restaurant). Some wonderful person stuck gum underneath the table and close to the edge of it.  As a result, I got gum all over my romper. I told the waitress and she immediately got me some ice and sent the manager out to apologize. The manager was extremely apologetic and helped us move to another table.  I appreciated the fact that they were sensitive to my dilemma although it wasn't their fault at all. As an extra apology, the manger comp'ed my entire bill. I appreciated her kindness because she really didn't have to do any of that. Customer service goes a long way for me and I will forever remember that! Thank you guys!",

Some, depending on the day, it looks different.    The portions are huge and priced well.   If you come for Sunday brunch, be prepared to wait a while.  Order smsime $2.00 mimosas at the bar while you wait.  Folks seem to like the macaroni. It's a very popular dish.    Some days, they have live music. Usually chill guitar. The bathrooms are clean.

I ordered the nachos and an iced tea (my server said their only option was mango, which I really enjoyed!).  When the server rounded the corner from the kitchen carrying my nachos, my jaw dropped.  I was only able to finish about a third of them -- the plate was MASSIVE and piled high with freshly baked chips smothered in salsa, guac, jalapenos, beans, melted cheese, and olives.  I picked at my decadent treat while reading on the patio as the sun set.  The woman serving me kept my tea full and even offered me one to go when I packed up to leave.  Thanks for the great experience!!",

Then I ordered the Hangover Helper (bc, duh). Unfortunately, they had ran out at that point in the day, but the waiter-person recommended the Enchiladas de Pollo. 'twas hella slappin, jammin, slammin, bangin; no complainin. Really tasty. And I generally never order non-fried chicken at restaurants, bc, like, its chicken. I don't know what these guys do but the chicken was so flavorful. And I feel lame for raving about shredded chicken but like just order it and tell me I am wrong. Go ahead. See what happens  And, honestly, I don't fault them for running out of the Hangover Helper. By the time we rolled into brunch, it was 1:59pm (Sunglasses and Advil; last night was mad real). Brunch ended at 2pm. They still gladly honored and served us under the brunch special. That is quality service right there. So, thank you again, the Vig.",

    "text": "Terrible service. Food was WAY over cooked. A regrettable experience for sure. Not happy at all. A total waste of time and money.  The manager told us to never come back because we had a complaint about our order. She has no experience with customer service and clearly does not have a clue as to how to do her job. When we asked if we could speak to an owner, she said that the owner was pretty much absent and that we would have to deal with her because there's nobody else above her. And that she called the shots. So this is bullshit and we will not be going back.  2/2/2019 Update:  I have been harassed by the staff of this establishment on yelp ever since I posted my initial review. I don't know what they're trying to accomplish here, but by far the worst customer service that I have ever seen. And I managed restaurants for close to 10 years in the upscale neighborhoods of Chicago. The hospitality at the Vig needs a lot of work and so does the quality of the food and the menu. If you ever have a problem at this establishment, instead of having the \"what can I do to make it better?\" attitude, they just proceed to harass and insult you until you leave. And if you leave a review anywhere online that they don't agree with, they will harass you long after you leave. It has been two weeks since my horrible experience there and I'm still getting harassed. That is a terrible way to run a restaurant. Customer service should always come first.",

The portion is large and very sharable. They were kind to split into 2 bowls.   Trifecta sliders with choice of fries:  sweet potato or regular. Served with curry mayo.  Again nice and savory.   The servers recommended our dinner and we usually take their advice and that was perfect dinner.   Thanks for a great meal after a long drive from Vegas.   We'll be back to try more!",

Seating is plentiful and the outside seating looked very nice- if it wasn't raining I would have sat there. Servers are social and helpful, ours suggested the dessert and I'm so glad we let him pick!   My only thing is the drinks don't seem very strong for the price. All I tasted was sugar and juice in my mango drink. Hopefully that changes.   I would definitely return to eat here and try the rest of the menu!",

Food order: a review of mine only but posting pics of all of it! 1) Burger with rings: - OMG cooked perfectly!  Brioch bun was amazing and fresh! - rings were cooked perfectly and crunchy with a touch of sweetness.  2) artichoke dip - robust and just the right amount of everything.  Served with pita and chips.  I will say however there are VERY large chunks so a little difficult to eat and kept breaking the chips.  Still delicious!!!  Will be back as often as possible!",

I splurged out and went with the Vig burger and it was delicious! It had a sunny side up egg, jalapeno, and avocado on top of the regular toppings. Something unique also that I really liked was that you can choose posele for the side instead of fries, and trust me when i say their posele is a must try! I couldn't decide between their burger or posele so this made it a great option. i also had a root beer beer that went perfectly with my burger. They have nice outside seating area with a bar outside as well which was perfect for the weather we are having right now in Phoenix. I can't wait to be back :)   One more thing staff was super friendly from the hostess to the waitress",

Unfortunately, the service was poor, and then one of our orders was completely wrong when we finally got the food. My husband got to eat his meal while I watched and waited for mine to be fixed. Then he was treated to waiting on me finish mine... The food was tasty, but the service wrecked it for us.",

When we finally sat down, it took the waitress 15 minutes to serve us water.  We waited an additional 45 minutes until my friend asked another server to have someone take our order.

    "text": "Stop by the Vig with my wife for cocktails & dinner this weekend.  It was a 30 min wait so we decided to dine at the bar. Seat's became available suddenly.    We sat down ready to get our drink and eat on but the white tatto macho bartender decided to completely ignore us.  We weren't rude, loud, or demanding, and have been known to say \"thank you\" way to much in one night.  However, the white tatto macho bartender looked us over and decided that we were not worth his time.   The white tatto macho bartender took orders around, accross from, directly next, and behind us. He didn't make eye contact or acknowledge we were sitting in front of him.  Just in case you don't know the bartender I'm talking about, he is a white male, close fade side hair with a 80's  INSYC  boy band top.  He has tatoos all over his arms, made sure to wear a sleeveless shirt to let the ladies know he has them.  He seemed sureal the way he blatently took orders from everyone but us.  I finaly had enough, there wasn't another bartender at the time to serve the only African American couple at the bar.   I polietly but loudly said excuse me. \"Hold on.\" he said. Walked away like I was bothering him to spend our money. Went over to another customer who has arrived after us and served them.    After serving that customer he started to dart to another customer but I stood up and said \"We were next sir.\"  \"Oh yeah.\" He took our order and made them like the devil told him not to. It was the sloppiest margarita and tito's cranberry you would ever see.   Matter of fact he didn't use tito's so I asked him remake it please. \"I know what I used.\" he replied. My wife of 15yrs can feel when I'm about to hulk out so she asked him iff he would please remake it.  He did but was not happy about it.  While he was making it My wife whisphered \"maybe he's having a bad day.  Tip him, he might cheer up.\"  I've bartended in the past so I know ain't everyday rosy behind the bar, you get real butt holes, I make special effort not to be that butt hole for this very reason.  I do know, as a bartender, you check your attitude at the door, especially when you get a tipper.  I tipped him $10 hoping he would change his attitude and let me enjoy a night out with my wife.  Nope.   I tried to get second drinks by waving a glass,  wife waving a glass, and saying exuse me.  He acknowledged us \"I'll be with you.\" and served someone else.   He even chatted up with a few of them for over five minutes, while we waited for him to get back to us.  After 30 minutes of him ignoring us a second bartender arrived.  Girl with glasses.   She took our order right away.  However, she had to go near the white tatto macho man to get something to finish our drinks.  He leaned in her ear, looked in our direction and they both giggled.  She looked at us too like she heard a bad joke about us.  I was done.    It took everything in me not to get unruly because this was blatant discrmination by that bartender.  I didn't want to ruin our night out by dealing with a blatant racist bartender.  Thank goodness Yelp exists to be able to express consumer business frustrations/mistreatment to people of color that might consider a night out at this Vig.  You've been warned about white tatoo macho man bartender.",

The best part about it was the sauce. The egg was undercooked in a few spots-gross. Other than that it was good but I'd say the drinks here far overtake the food in quality.

Mac n cheese was really good too.   Now, where it gets not so stellar. The service was slow and there were noticeably large gaps between seeing our server. He was really nice, we just didn't see him a lot and ended up waiting a while to order/pay. I'm not upset by it because we did go on a Friday night so it was a bit busy.

    "text": "First time going to The Vig at this location, and it will also be my last.  A couple of friends and I decided to have lunch here today and boy do I wish we went somewhere else.  We arrived and the hostess was very friendly (young girl with long hair) asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside.  The weather was nice so we decided outside.  As I observed the seating area outdoors it was not too bad, and not too busy.  I got up and  gone to the bathroom and returned to the server stating that he would bring me a water.  As he came back, I started to drink my water in a glass that was cracked down the side.  I patiently waited for my server to return.  When he didn't, my friend stopped another server and told her about my water.  The server took my glass and said, \"I will bring you another one.\"  (Except she never came back).  As an employee came out with our appetizer, we asked him if we could not only get my water but refills..   He was nice enough to help his fellow employee out and brought us more water.    Our food came out, I ordered the Greek salad with no chicken.  It came out and I began eating it only to notice this one spot where it almost looked like dirt.  I decided to rub it between my fingers because there was no way that it could have been dirt in my salad.  Especially not at this fine establishment.  I mean I was willing to pay 13 dollars for some lettuce, olives, 2 pieces of feta, and 1 garbanzo bean.. oh wait I forgot and some dirt aka oregano.     I called my server over to tell him what I had found.  He decided to take my salad and call over the chef.       I waited and waited (btw I was so hungry).  Finally someone named Liza came over (who appeared to be the manager).  Who btw made no eye contact and I felt like what was supposed to be an apology was just rude and condescending.  She basically told me she was sorry but that was not dirt.  It was oregano and she comped my salad and walked away (acting like that's what I was looking for).  She was not sincere at all, and I felt like she did not even care.  Did I mention I was still hungry. Yeah, um she didn't ask if I wanted anything else.. or if I wanted to see the menu.. just walked away.. um really.. what ever happened to good customer service!?   This was the worst experience EVER!  I would not recommend this place to my enemy!  So unprofessional anddddddd as soon as my bill came the server finally apologized.  Really Brian!?  In all of my life I have never not left a tip, even if my service was bad.  I guess there is a first time for everything.  And it wasn't only due to the dirt salad.. it was the fact that your service sucked too!",

It started off really good, once we get our whole group there is was completely down hill... Almost every person has their order messed up and it took almost 45 minutes just to get a draft beer...   We were ready to leave made the mgr on duty aware of the situation and he did close to nothing about the situation, it all seemed like he told everyone to avoid our tables. How could one restaurant mess up a table so bad! At least half our table had our order messed up or not delivered after an hour and their reason was \"sorry we don't know what happened\"....   After we BEGGED for our tab for 30-45 mins by standing up and requesting several times, they finally hand it over with an auto 18% grat charge... Again. Daniel was great, however there is he had 3 or 4 tables with 10+ people... He could barely handle our 25 plus table and mgt wouldn't allow him otherwise. Like seriously VIg, realize that when a group makes a reservations for 25 people or requires a server by it's self or at least 2-3 servers!  Would NEVER recommend this again based on my experience tonight! Mgt really didn't care about our thoughts or concerns or that it took 2 hours to get food, I hope owners review this concern with mgt and realize there is an issue!",

I've heard from a couple friends that it's a great place but I knew they always went for drinks at night or in the late evening. Being that I live in the east valley, it's not always easy to make it downtown for drinks so I never bothered to try it.  Today, though, I decided to see what their lunchtime was like and I would definitely recommend it.  It's a really cool little spot and you can drive right by it if you're not paying attention; just look for all the cars lined up for the complimentary valet and you'll be fine.  The atmosphere is casual yet chic and refined. I can definitely see it being an awesome night spot to hang out with friends in an elevated but not stuffy environment. The staff were very friendly and attentive, seating us quickly and bringing waters right away while inquiring about any other drinks we may want. (This was a lunch break, so no go, unfortunately.)   We were able to put our orders in in a very timely manner. They have a few cards from the game Trivial Pursuit sitting on the tables which was a great way to enjoy ourselves until our food arrived. I ordered \"The Vigan,\" which is their vegan sandwich, with sweet potato fries. This is an excellent spin on your customary vegan sandwich but with lots of familiarity. They swapped raw or grilled onions for pickled, and raw tomato for roasted, both of which brought something new to an otherwise common sandwich. There was also a side of some sort of yellow curry dipping sauce which was bright and flavorful and added a unique twist to the dish overall.  My coworker went for the turkey sandwich and had already taken two huge bites before I could ask to snap a picture. Needless to say he was more than happy with his choice. Also, he opted for a salad as his side and unlike most places, they did not skimp on that. Kudos.  I can't wait to go back and try their black bean burger, some appetizers, and several other dishes that stood out on the menu. Hopefully, I'll be able to make an evening trip sooner rather than later.",

Tristan was attentive, knowledgeable and super efficient and friendly. Everything he suggested was PERFECT. The calamari was solid...SOLID.... I could tell you all about the menu, but I say, just see Tristan, he'll steer you to all of the good-good.   The staff overall is not pretentious and really nice. i can't say anything negative about any of  them but Tristan was a standout.   Overall, it's a nice, fun, and casual place. The hipsters are cool to watch and the young attorneys chilling after work are equally entertaining. The patio is one of the very best in town.",

There might have been other food that was gone before we got there. Of the food we got to taste, the Guacamole was amazingly good. Spicy, but good. The little burgers were fine as well.

Was excited to eat here! Walked in at 10:50 (they serve food until 11) and we're told \" sorry, the kitchen already closed down and left... you can go drink outside at the bar though\" we got up and embarrassed walked out in front of 2 tables still eating looking confused?  Which i totally understand it is not cool to walk in so close to closing but during a late game night and given the selection downtown... (which is slim) I would think you should at least be mindful of that. Not to mention.... If you say you'll serve food until 11.... You should serve food until 11!  One a first date it was a pretty upsetting experience. I will not ever be returning to this location nor will I recommend anyone. Poor customer service.",

It might have been that the menu is one of the worst I have seen (Pad Thai and Burgers? Mexican food and Edamame?). It might be their apparent love affair with American cheese, or as I call it, plastic. (Why not use cheddar?) Sorry to say it, but based on their current menu, I most likely will not return. I wish them all the best and hope they create a better menu.",

Very hip/trendy without being pretentious. It's easier to find parking here than at other places downtown. The food menu is a weird mix of everything with so-so execution. None of the appetizers we ordered were particularly rave-worthy. Reasonable prices on beer and wine. Service is friendly when they're around. We did have to wave servers down a few times throughout the night. Come for happy hour of half-off wine bottles on Sunday.",

They have an awesome outdoor patio area but it can get noisy out there. There is inside seating in a mostly glass room, lots of light and also seating in the bar area which is like eating in a little pub. Love their food, especially Sunday brunch, my favorite is \"hangover  helper\", which is like lasagne made with layered corn tortillas, pork carnitas, red sauce, cheese and onions, so delicicious. One of my favorites. They also have bottomless Mimosas for Sunday brunch for $15. Bring a designated driver or take the light rail and walk to 4th and Fillmore. parking can be an issue, you're probably going to have to walk from your car. but it's worth it! The service is always above average and friendly.",

We asked for new ones...it seemed like they were just reheated. Although, our waiter was very nice and took it off the bill.  The guacamole was great but we couldn't eat it without the chips. In addition, I ordered the steak salad and the steak tasted disgusting....like it had been sitting out or was old. Not sure if it's because it was happy hour or what. Although our waiter was nice the staff is a little unprofessional overall.",

Our \"spread\" consisted of a fruit tray resembling something you could pick up at Costco, bland hummus and cold pita bread, and something I believe was intended to be sandwiches but really they were just 5 inch thick buttered buns cut in half with something unrecognizable slapped in between.  Again, very bland.  I have yet to figure out what everyone loves about the Vig.  There were heat lamps out on the patio so scorchingly hot I thought my flesh was melting off of my face standing 2 feet away.  The only positive thing I can say is that the wine/drinks were decent.",

The other thing I would like to mention is when you order a salad, why do they bring it out with the dinner unless you specifically ask for it to be served before your dinner, second time this has happened.  We are no longer frequent fans.  The menu changed 90 days ago, per the server, but we had not ordered the tacos the last few times we were dining, so this was a surprise to us.",

The place makes me want to drink (in a good way), they have totally set the tone with lighting and ambiance. Service was great all around.  But the food was just sort of \"meh\". We had the bacon wrapped dates (good, but very small for the $8 or $9 they are charging). I had a steak salad, pretty standard but satisfying (in no way crave-able though). My husband had the Vigazz burger, which was cooked perfectly, but was disappointed it didn't come on a pretzel bun like it does at the uptown location (he says the bun really sets it apart). Another in our party had the greek salad and it looked like a salad you would get at the airport in one of those to-go stands.  The table next to us had the nachos, which looked and smelled wonderful. So I am guessing their menu is hit and miss.",

I was ecstatic to see they had a vegan option, the Tofu Scramble breakfast burrito.  Top three breakfast burritos I've ever had.  The tofu was firm, well seasoned and paired great with the roasted veggies and guacamole.  I added black beans for a little extra something too. Since they had $4 bloody mary bar, I decided to try that out.  Their bloody mix is a little bitter for my tastes, but the selection of add-ins, sauces and pickles veggies is top notch.  Our bartender was working her fanny off with the $3 mimosa special, but managed to keep our drinks full and check in on us regularly.  This location opens at 11am, and they were pretty busy less than thirty minutes after opening. There's a small lot that is free, and the street is metered. My group also had breakfast enchiladas and the Monte Cristo, both of which got devoured.  I would def go back!",

The inside space is not so bueno. I typically ride my bike here, but my most recent trip was via light rail stop at Roosevelt with one of my most favorite people in the world... and it wasn't too bad of a walk through some older/cute neighborhoods.   The food here has been great every time I've been. I've had several items on the menu and each has been well executed and brought out in a timely fashion. This last trip I had the Best Turkey sandwich and I'd definitely get that again. I typically get their salads and all of them are YUMMY!   Clientele is typical of DT PHX for the most part, although in the later brunching hours it seems to change a bit - into a younger/hungover crowd. But there's plenty of outdoor space to be off in your own corner enjoying our awesome PHX weather year-round.",

The crowd was everything but fun. I mean seriously...after our first round of Bocce, a small group arrived & decided it would be ok to hang out on the green, then had the audacity to tell us we were being rude b/c we threw the ball in their direction \"aggressively.\" Ha- It was so absurd the lack of etiquette combined with attitude refusing to step off the green & antagonizing a fight with us to top it off. I had to get security.  Bocce balls were about to go though some heads.  I don't know, but maybe installing a fence along the green near the bar may help guide immature bar crowd to stay on the patio...?  Considering the selection of restaurants & bars in this area, It would be safe to say I most likely will not be returning. I mean for reals...the Vig is known for having a Bocce court.

Let me tell you friends, WE LOVE THE VIG FILLMORE!!!  Again, frequent customers. However, today Friday around 1230pm, we arrived for lunch and got seated right away. I was glad they were about 40% full. Every other time we've gone it's usually packed. Yet we always have great service, great food and great time.   The server was an elderly (compared to all the young kids) tiny lady. She did greet us and with a \"I'm going to smile through my teeth\" attitude. She could not care less. When she brought our waters we asked for lemons. Never came until we reminded her again a long while later. She took our drink order and that took forever as well. She finally brought them and came back humming every time. Literally humming some random tune as she arrived and waited for our response???  seriously???  Like she didn't care about what she was doing. Her time humming was more valuable. Took our order and didn't see her again. Someone else brought our food out. Reminder again:  the food and service has always been TOPS. Today we unfortunately got a server who didn't give or seemed like she knew why she was there. Our nachos and drinks were super yummy.   Server came back (humming to herself) as we were done. We asked for the check and she nodded as she hummed and walked away. Brought check humming, set it down   No \"thank you\" , no \"have a nice day\". Walked away. Now because our food was great and brought out by other helpers like hostess and helpers who actually had a personality and smile and greeted us and said please and thank you, I left my usual high tip. However, our server of Hispanic descend should not be serving people. No smiles. No personality.  Next time we are int hat area we will do a quick recon and see if she is there or what tables she is not helping, we will request those.  Have a nice day!",

    "text": "I was in Phoenix with some friends one weekend back in October and we were looking for bottomless brunch.  We had a hard time finding one the morning of so we decided to just try the Vig Fillmore since their drinks were cheap (at least compared to NYC - not sure what the prices are usually like in Phoenix!)  It was raining that morning so we couldn't sit outside (their outdoor seating area looked really cute!!) but the interior decor was really cute and home-y.  I will be honest and say I don't remember what entree I got but I do remember enjoying it.  We also each got our own champagne bottle and got juices on the side so we can make our own mimosas!! So it was basically bottomless brunch for us :p  Also must add, we were all SO SURPRISED when the tab came -- the bill was SO CHEAP. Again, don't know if that's normal in Phoenix or not but I definitely would not mind enjoying a brunch like that for that price!! If I ever make a trip out to Phoenix again, I will definitely be back :)",

    "text": "It was a relatively cool evening in PHX so we were able to sit out on the patio to eat dinner. The patio is great and I would recommend sitting outside if you can. We started with the Guacamole App, which is discounted until six for happy hour pricing. The Guacamole was solid with a strong chip to Guac ratio. They had a good drink menu for Happy Hour too.   We moved on to the Entrees which involved a lot of salad and Mac and Cheese. At the table we got the Greek, Strawberry Field and Avocado Cobb. All looked great and were big servings with what looked like fresh ingredients.   A number of us got the Mac and Cheese. There are a number of meat additions you can add to it if you would like. We got it with Grilled Chicken and one with Short Ribs, which were great. You can also get it baked if you would like it that way (I recommend it).   I got the recommended house burger, The Vig. The flavor of the burger was good and I am always a fan of a fried egg on my burgers. If there was anything lacking on this one it would be the bun. I just didn't think it added anything to the burger. They offer the option of a variety of sides for the burger and I opted for the Mac and cheese and was very happy with that choice.   The service was great and the atmosphere was great. I would definitely go back.",

    "text": "And another updated review! After my last post about being told the Pad Thai has fish sauce, the general operations manager got in touch about what went wrong. He checked with the executive chef, and the Pad Thai IS vegan if you leave off the egg (Yeay! It was delicious!). The hummus is vegan, but the breads served with it are not. However, they can sub in tortilla chips for the bread. The bean burger is vegan, but the bread (and obviously the mayo) is not. And the chef recommends the Asian chop salad, substitute tofu for the chicken. He's going to talk further with the staff about serving people with dietary restrictions (and I'm encouraging them to better mark the menu or offer a side menu for special diets).  I will try The Vig again sometime, so expect another update someday...",

It was definitely more than an hour because their late night menu is awesome.   Let's be honest. The $6 cocktails were really what drew me in to the happy hour. I wasn't sure what to expect but I'll take cheap cocktails in an upscale environment any day. We ordered like 5 diff cocktails from the menu and man were they boozy. Depends what you're looking for, but I definitely needed that in my life. Their cocktails are also pretty unique and memorable. I wish I had been sober enough to remember what I had but hey it's a testament to how good they were.   Cherry on top - I had the nachos to go with my drinks and my stomach was quite pleased even though I had already eaten dinner beforehand. Nachos are hard to get right and they were pretty good at the Vig. Idk if that's because of the drinks I had before eating the nachos or just because the nachos were good. Try it for yourself!  Final final cherry on the top - dining outside here is awesome. The string lights and outdoor bar are so romantic and make for great vibes for a great night. I'd fully recommend coming here!",

I had dinner at the Vig Uptown recently and decided to venture here to see the differences.   I couldn't get over how great the turkey sandwich was at the Uptown Vig, so I ordered it again here. I know, but, why try something different when this creates such an awesome sensation in my mouth. Even though there are several great choices on the menu here, I'm just stuck in a rut, but a good rut! I even ordered the same side (roasted brussel sprouts), and I have to say that these were cooked to perfection (I was not a fan of the other ones I had at the Uptown, but these were great). Of course, the pickle is always a nice addition to the meal. I did take a taste of the macaroni, and even though it has fantastic reviews, I'm just not a mac n cheese lover, but the person in my party who ordered it thought it was tasty!  Wait staff was great here, too. There are a couple of screens around that you can watch whatever is on if that's your thing.",

Today's was the cold Brew old fashioned and it was DELICIOUS, completely unexpected combination and makes me want to experiment and make it a at home since I love both of those things individually!  My fried chicken sandwich today was amazing. I think my eyes rolled back a few times as I bit in to it. That Curry side sauce was the craziest accompaniment to a fried Chicken on ciabatta sandwich and it worked so freakin well. I'm so glad I went for it! Amazing.  My kids burger as very tasty. I stole a bite or two. The onion rings were yummy.  Overall it was very enjoyable... even waiting a bit to have lunch on a busy Saturday with two kids, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit...

Chicken sando with bacon was great, but the Soy Garlic Edamame stole the show. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since.",

You shouldn't have to worry about the sound of heavy trucks disturbing your meal.  There are distinct areas where you can be seated to eat. You can sit at the bar and enjoy whatever is on the TVs above the bar. You can sit in the bar where there are a few booths for a sports bar experience. You can also sit outside if the weather is agreeable. You can sit in the restaurant area for a more traditional dining experience.  The menu is not too extensive so it should be easy for you to decide what you want to eat. I ordered a hamburger and a bowl of pozole, the highly recommended chili side. An excellent choice. All the food seems to be very tasty. Their roasted Brussels sprouts are awesome.  They have a full bar and their happy hour is a great deal if you are a wine drinker as you get a 9 ounce pour for the price of a 6 ounce pour.  Try out the Vig and enjoy a fun meal.",

The patio with the outside bar was really nice on an early fall day.  The house itself just celebrated it's 100th birthday.  As usual the food at the Vig did not disappoint.  I had corned beef hash that lived atop a potato pancake.  The chunks of corned beef were tossed with peppers and onions that had a taste reminiscent of Ro-Tel, but not quite.  The two perfectly poached eggs were covered in a chipotle hollandaise sauce. Easily one of the best renditions of a corned beef hash I have had. The other six in our party were just as pleased with their food.  Service was great and the chef even spent a few moments at our table talking about some of the modifications we could ask for that were not noted on the menu, like he tries to keep a fresh can of bacon grease on the grill for those folks that want their food cooked in it.  He mentioned that after he overheard me talking about searing a medium rare filet in bacon grease in cast iron.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of eating here for both Sunday Brunch and dinner during my week long business trip to Phoenix.  Tucked just a few blocks off the beaten path, this is an ideal spot to get away from the normal city dining, maybe even feel at home. You have the option for in or outdoor seating, either way you're going to have good service and great food.  Brunch has your typical bloody mary bar and bottomless mimosas but they have a unique menu with a lot of homemade, freshly sourced ingredients. I tried the corned beef hash with poached eggs. I'll openly admit that for right or wrong, I'm normally a fan of the canned cbh, so this was a dish outside of my comfort zone and I really enjoyed it. The only down side was that the whites of my eggs were a tad undercooked... so when I discovered the gelatin like substance l was done. Luckily I had already ate my fair share.  Although I loved brunch scene, I have to say that I enjoyed dinner a bit more. Our small group sat outside on a mild evening to enjoy some company, beers and dinner. I went pretty basic and got the cheeseburger. As basic as it may be as a choice, it wasn't in flavor. I really enjoyed it as well as the skinny cut fries. They also have a decent beer selection.",

    "text": "This was one of my favorite restaurants for a date night. Everything was awesome at The Vig (Fillmore)... Start to finish. The atmosphere, service, and food were perfection. I love the various areas that you can sit at The Vig. We started off in the bar and watched a bit of football, and ended our night on the patio listening to live music (shout out to Vinyl Station who perform on Sundays). We enjoyed a bottle of wine (50% off on Sundays), and our server helped us select a wine that we absolutely loved after we told him wines we enjoyed. The wine was Pine Ridge, and if you enjoy a white wine, it was a lovely choice. My husband had the Prime Vig sandwich with a side of pozole. He raved about his sandwich and shared a few bites of his beautifully flavorful pozole. I had been dreaming of the steak salad since the last time I enjoyed a dinner at The Vig. I went to a different Vig location the first time I ordered the salad, but the consistency was seamless. This steak salad was just as stellar as the one I had a year+ ago and from a completely different location... Not always easy to achieve when restaurants expand like that. I'm not sure I will ever order anything else at The Vig because I am so hung up on that particular salad. We treated ourselves to strawberry shortcake for dessert. It was not your typical strawberry shortcake, as it was served in a mason jar. I am a dessert lover (as in I look at the dessert menu first) and this one goes down as one of my top-five favorites. It had a cinnamon sponge cake, similar to the flavor of a churro, with fresh strawberries and whip cream. It was the ideal ending to our meal.",

    "text": "What can I say?  A fan at first sight!  Patio presence!    Immediately the option of outside was my only requirement because I heard the food here is incredible.  So here we are.  We ordered a sandwich and a specialty dish off the Vig menu.    The first was the Vanilla braised short rib tacos - on flour tortillas w/Asian sweet glaze, house made Kimchi, spicy aioli and crispy shallots ($15).  I thought the flavor had a good mix of flavor and balance with the sweet Asian glaze on the short rib counterbalanced with the Kimchi spice and subtle flour tortilla and then finally an added crunch from the fried shallots.  Definitely squeeze some lime juice onto your taco because there's a lot of sweetness in the glaze.  Overall a yummy taco.    The second dish was the Prime Vig Dip - sliced medium rare beef, smoked gouda, grilled onions, chipotle mayo au jus ($14).  Oh and also with an included side - onion rings today.  The onion rings were huge and expected to taste just as it would....greasy goodness.  The sandwich was meaty and moist and really worked nicely with the melted cheese and sauce.  You can't go wrong with sauce and especially if cheese is one of the ingredients in a sandwich.  Dipped in the au jus.... mmmmmm.  These were great suggestions!!  I would love to come back and try another top 2 entree.",

Great wine by the glass selection - ended up getting the Vig sauvignon blanc and it's solid.  Pozole soup is excellent: traditional mexican soup with grain, onion, pork, avocado. I had it in new mexico.  I like this particular one because there isn't too much grain and had a bit of a kick to it.  Garlic soy edamame: super big portion.  Could benefit from a bit less sauce or extra sauce on the side.   Fish taco: delicious and fresh.   Great spot to check out,  especially for a late night meal after 10.30pm.",

Nice breezy wind blowing through the bar area which sits in the middle so traffic flows well.  While the sunset upon the valley makes this place somewhat romantic!  HH specials on food and drinks; you can't pass this up!  I ordered their Grilled Fish Tacos along with a Stella Artois (Ever since that Adrian Brody Super Bowl commercial I've been drinking this like water -- darn you Super Bowl ads!)  Anyways, my fish tacos were amazingly tasty! Blackened whitefish with some pico de gallo and   spicy slaw gave this dish some kick and nice crunchy texture!

What I Ordered: -Tito's Bloody Mary Bar ($4) -Guac and Chips ($8)  Drinks: -Bloody Mary, at $4, is hard to beat. This special is only made with Tito's vodka (cannot be changed to gin for example). You're given a glass with ice and vodka, and you build the rest yourself. The bartender may forget to tell you, so go to the inside bar (either entrance) and the bloody mary bar is stationed on the end. -fixins: bacon, pickled asparagus, olives, cocktail onions, celery, various hot sauces (Tabasco, etc), black pepper, salt.  Food: -the guacamole (and the chips) were really good, I ate the whole thing without a second thought. -considered ordering an actual meal but it was hot as h### and I didn't feel like touching anything above 80 degrees.  Ambiance: -the patio was particularly crowded... and loud. -a lot of complaints about people smoking. I didn't see a single person (not that it would bother me because we're OUTSIDE).  -misters going in certain areas, none directly over the bar unfortunately. -TVs over the bar -live jazz band playing on the patio  Staff: -the patio bartender I had was not the least bit friendly, and not just to me. He seemed more interested on socializing with those he personally deemed interesting and worth his time. Funny, cuz I'm a great tipper and an excellent conversation partner. -inside bartender was much more pleasant; in fact, all other staff were helpful and polite.  Parking: -had to park about 2 blocks away on the street in front of a condemned house; wish they'd get a better parking situation.  I'll be back to visit the Vig every so often, just so that I can brunch in a brunchy atmosphere and pretend like Arizona isn't a sweltering desert pit of despair. Bring on the bloody marys!",

A guy answered and said they don't take reservation for less than 9 but it shouldn't be a problem for 4 since they're not busy.  We arrived and the hostess said that it was a 45 min wait.  I told her that I've called.  She replied that she doesn't know who I talked to and it's not True.  She wouldn't let us wait in the inside bar when it was 115 degrees outside.  The outside bar does not have one fan or mister turned on.  It was not even shady.  This is AZ, folks.  No offer for water or drinks while we waited outside.  We would leave but our friends were coming, parking and starting to walk in.  We thought we give it a try.  We should have known better.  The food was just OK.  My Hangover something was just tortillas mashed with pork and an egg on top.  The Breakfast Sandwich looked like it came from Jack in the Box.  The burger was meh.  The Steak Salad was oily and soupy.  I don't know why people raved about this place. The place was small, dark, dirty and dingy.  When we left, we said to each other that it was still so hot.  The hostess then chimed in and said, \"try being outside all day like me\".  We WERE outside and we're the paying patrons paying her wages.  She is paid to work there.  If she's so concerned, she should ask her manager to set up her hostess stand inside.  She also said, \"this place is better in the Winter, not so much now\".  Thank you, Sherlock girl, for that tip.  If the guy answering the phone and she would have told us that first, we wouldn't have came and stayed.    I wouldn't go back for the parking (there were none), the poor customer service and especially the foods.  Downtown Phoenix has many great places to eat at.  Don't go here.  Don't let the \"Best Brunch\" sign fool you.  The management needs to train the staff to be more hospitable and make better dishes.",

Food was served buffet style and we were able to pick out 5 different menu items for our guests to enjoy. When it came to alcohol/beer, the servers were on top of making sure we got drinks. All in all, they made sure we were being taken care of on one of our biggest days.   They also have a great brunch menu. Bottomless mimosas are $15.00! You can't go wrong with that.   Dinner menu is great. I feel like every time I come here I have to try every dish. The Hot Vings are my favorite. I like to get half traditional and half thai sweet chili. Another appetizer I do enjoy are the cheesy tator tots. They are basically these huge tator tots stuff with cheesy goodness.   My other favorite dinner dishes are: Big bowl of Posole, the Prime Vig Dip, Fillmore Burger, and the Pad Thai.",

Went back for a re-up of yam fries twice now and they were completely destroyed.  Tasted like cardboard.  Vig cooks are coating the yams with some fry stuff that makes the fries hard and way overcooked.  I'm not happy at all.  Pas du tout!  On top of that the curry sauce tasted sweetened.  Yuck!  Will not be ordering yam fries again.   Damn you, Vig!  Damn you!   Fish tacos are a'ight, so maybe I'll go back for those.  No time soon though.",

I especially like the way this location took a 100 year old house and converted it to an inside bar.   The food is amazing as all Vigs are. I went with the Tater Tots, the NYC Reuben and my GF went with the Fish Tacos.  I would highly recommend my alteration which was suggested by my waiter. He told me to take the Reuben, put it on Pretzel Bread and get a side of Au Ju Sauce, delightful it was.  I will be back and look forward to the next live music acoustic set which they seem to always nail.",

We got the sliders (5$), the flatbread (5$), and the fish tacos (5$). They also had other items that were less expensive like dips and breads and whatnot that were 3-4$, but we didn't try those. Aaanyway, the flatbread of the day was a roasted tomatillo, roasted garlic, cheddar, mozz, and sausage... ohh soooo good. The roasted veg was awesome. I kind of loved it. It was pretty large as well. The sliders (3) came with a big pile of fries and were also quite large. They were very tasty and the bun was especially good and flavorful... which you don't typically find on a slider. The fish tacos (4) were also large and just a little spicy, they came with a really good tomatillo salsa. For dessert we got a brownie to share at the waiter's recommendation, but this was my least favorite part of the meal. The brownie was absolutely flavorless... what a waste of calories.  Although I don't think I would recommend the brownie, I will certainly be back for happy hour!  PS Like its predecessor Local Breeze, this place has a great patio, large and pretty with a bocce ball court! Alright!",

It's a popular locale and definitely can get busy after five with people filing in after work. The food is good but it really depends on what you get. We got guac and chips with salsa for the table. It was flavorful and the salsa was delicious but since it is Phoenix, I've definitely had better at a lower price. The Prime Vig Dip was a pretty big disappointment for our table. The beef was over cooked and so chewy it was easier to just take out some of the meat so there would be less chewing. The Maple Glazed Salmon was pretty good, the cut of salmon was cooked well. I personally got the Lean and Green Steak Salad. The presentation for everything was beautiful. The steak salad I got was good, though it could have used more flavors. The balsamic glaze didn't add enough dimension and the cheeses didn't make a big impact. The steak was cooked very well and definitely held up the dish. The cocktails were reasonable though I've had better at a better price so I'd go somewhere else for drinks. All in all, It was good but I don't know if I would come back unless someone actually wanted to go.",

I've had the Pad Thai, their veggie burger, and the macaroni and cheese.  The Mac & cheese is my favorite but I'm from Wisconsin so anything with cheese is my favorite.   My only complaint is that the lighting in the ladies room is awful.  It's artful and decorative but some how the light doesn't illuminate your face when you lean toward the mirror.  How am I supposed to get my lip gloss on straight without proper lighting? Not wear lip gloss you say? That is nonnegotiable my friend.",

So being a person that is absolutely in LOVE with breakfast/Brunch my mind automatically said we are definitely getting breakfast!  I ordered the Corn beef hash with poached eggs, I was not expecting it to look the way it did but OMG was it the best thing next to steak and eggs? Pretty damn close! My mom had ordered the deconstructed fish tacos and was loving that because she ate it like a salad in a way and was completely satisfied which is a plus since shes just as picky as I can be.  My brother ordered the BBQ Hot Vings and also liked those I tried one and wanted another but stopped myself from asking since thats all he had ordered.

I returned and waited for the second half to be made. When I got home, I realized they messed up the order. We called the restaurant and Megan kindly gave us a gift card. She didn't try making excuses, just fixed the problem. I ordered takeout again tonight, and she recognized who I was. She made sure to check the order and hand it to me herself when I picked it up. This is a shining example of how customer service should be! Thank you Megan! You kept us as customers and now I'll happily recommend The Vig to others!",

Sports TVs over the bar throws off the trendy -chic of this place.",

But I was pretty bummed when I went up to the bar at the Fillmore location and the bartender told me they didn't have any of the wines on the wine list ... what?.... My favorite wine they serve is Left Coast pinot, I get it every time I'm at the Vig (at the other locations) and they said they didn't have that, so I was like ok, no big deal. But then to tell me they \"probably didn't have anything on the wine list\" very odd. But the bartender poured me something & I liked it, so it worked out - just very weird. We then told the bartender we were going to a show at Comerica theater and he gave us 20% off the bill.. very nice. 1 glass of wine ; 1 draft beer ; 1 fire ball shot ; 1 gummy bear = $10 bar tab. Awesome. Just need to get the wine situation figure out, but that wont stop me from coming here.",

We ordered the carne asada potato pancake dish and split it with a side of sweet potato and regular fries. The food was delightful to the palate and tastefully presented. The service, however, left much to be desired. Our server, Lauren, greeted us promptly but proceeded to ignore our table after we gave our split order. We had to flag her down to ask for lemons, add the side of fries, and for the check while she stopped by all of her other tables to see how they were doing and how their food tasted. We did not receive the same service. It was really frustrating to see other tables receive considerate service and attention while being ignore and avoided.",

Given an estimate of an hour to be seated... When it was an hour and half checked in with hostess and she replied well that's just an estimate. Actually took 2 hours to be seated and at that it was the waiting area that they cleared and sat us at. Unless your rear was at very edge of bench then you couldn't reach the coffee table to eat which could barely fit our food on. Furniture was bolted down so you couldn't move it closer. So hunching over or eating on your lap was only option. Our waiter tried their best but I feel forgot us many times because like I said this isn't a place they usually serve people. We did arrive at this place about 545pm and there was plenty of room inside but we were told it was reserved for owners party. When we left at 9 those tables still were empty.  To top it off we ordered desserts and one was brought out right away and the other took another 30 minutes to get. By this time we did have a manager come and apologize but it seemed disingenuous and just away to brush us off. She also said the check had been closed out so there was no discount on our bill whatsoever. We did however get a $20 gift card but we aren't coming back and that didn't help the fact we ordered about 10 drinks from bar and 2 appetizers, 7 entrees and 2 desserts.  Wish it would have been a better experience as the ambiance and food seemed top notch.  Wait I almost forgot the best part... The stray cats there was two I believe and one decided to use the restroom next to us.",

It almost seems hidden, quaint and surrounded with twinkle lights and tress that just set a very relaxed mood. I was pretty excited when my girlfriend suggested the place for a double date. We arrived and instead of having to wait a half hour it only took about 15! The inside of this place was alive on a Saturday afternoon and the bar was just lovely. It was just like having dinner at a friends back yard.   Ok food, my friends ordered pad Thai and t smelled sooo good! They lived it! The Vig ass burger was well cooked and juicey as for my meal, well I ordered the Greek salad with chicken. To start with it wasn't very flavorful. Upon further inspection, my chicken was partially raw.... Seems like the worst right? Let me tell you, once I mentioned it to the staff, I was offered another salad to replace the other-much more delicious when cooked btw- and the manager comped it. Seem good so far? WELL not only did they redeem themselves but my belly was so happy and full after the manager also comped dessert! My friends and I enjoyed the chocolate walnut brownie so much. The food was good and the management even better! Thanks guys! We will definitely be coming back and bringing more friends along!",

We were crowded together at a too-small table, despite having made a reservation. The service was unbelievably slow. The vegetarian options on the menu were limited. However, when I asked them to make my dish with tofu instead (which you would think screams vegetarian preference), it still came out with shrimp and an egg. We had waited so long for the food that I let it go and simply shared the shrimp and suffered the egg, but I definitely wouldn't come here for food in the future.",

The service was thorough and well paced even for a large group. I had the grilled fish tacos that were both tasty and the perfect amount of food. My sister had the Mac and cheese which was very rich and quite large (not complaining). They also have good drinks and specials. I had astronomy style margarita that had a small hot bite to it from jalapenos.   The final topper was that our waiter offered up free dessert for celebration of the bachelorette. Apparently for birthdays you get a complimentary dessert but he was nice enough to extend this offer to us for our bachelorette celebration.",

After about 30 min we still didn't have our guacamole & chips and she didn't even come back to see if we wanted more drinks.

All I can say is \"meh.\"  First, they weren't preparing the full menu. The hostess sat down the menu but never said this. Then  the waitress comes. Beautiful black young lady, just to add. She explains that it is Valentines, the kitchen was having Valentines dinners, and then decide to only continue making tapas. -_- ugh, here we go.  So we ordered 2 hot chicks, 2 mac and cheese, 3 tacos, and sliders. NO modifications. This also doesn't sound like a difficult order right?  (SIDENOTE: there was a table of two here prior to our sitting down, a table of two that were sat after we were seated.) About 45 mins go by he we hadn't got our food. BUT the aforementioned two tables, had.  A member of our table got up to inquire about the order, it came out minutes later.   THE FOOD WAS COLD. Ugh . Annoying. You made me wait that long? Then everything didn't come out at the same time?   A guest came shortly after. Ordered a drink and 4 shots, took about 10 mins for those to come.  The shots were strong. That's why the rating is three stars.  Tonight was a let down forreal. I've been here multiple times, and multiple times to other locations. Sub par food, for really no reason because it isn't even busy. Consistency. The only thing I ask for, in all areas of my life.",

To our surprise they have changed the menu. To my husband's disappointment they no longer have the VigAz burger on the menu. The server did a great job attempting to  make up for it by suggesting to add bacon & arugula. Too bad that they didn't add the arugula (just the ice berg) and they forgot the bacon. The server brought out a side of bacon, but needless to say it just wasn't the same. Oh and they took the Rulemule (Moscow mule) off too. :( I was relieved that they still had my vig dip! But *gasp* I didn't notice that they changed how it's made. Ugh. The pretzel bun is so much more tastier, now they have some type of a wheat roll, they took out the delicious havarti cheese for something else that only adds to the blandness of the meat. The Aujus is just as disappointing because it tasted like watered down soy sauce. Luckily the fries were left untouched but it doesn't make up for the meal.  We MAY come back just for drinks but our family dinners will most likely be elsewhere..our last memory this meal - we still spent $50 for a meal that we didn't really like.

However, over the past few months, the prices on happy hour have gone up to the point that they are pretty much regular prices, the hummus platter has been changed and is much less shareable, and the kale dip is no longer even on the happy hour menu. We have started going to other spots for our get togethers but wanted to visit the Vig again this evening - we made a reservation for 10, which is the size of our usual group and we usually make a reservation. However, when the first few folks arrived, we were told we could not take the table - NOT because it was too busy, but because it was too INCONVENIENT for them to serve us as we arrived. Instead, we were forced to sit at the bar RIGHT NEXT to our table that remained empty for 30 minutes as our party arrived - we have never been treated this way before, and I doubt we will return. This used to be a fun, casual place with great food and drinks for a great price.  The prices and the atmosphere are no longer good. It is very disappointing.",

Great service, great menu with plenty of 'pig out' and healthy options, great variety of beers on tap and excellent speciality cocktails.   The Vig in Arcadia being a local favorite of mine when I visit Phoenix (every few months), I decided to give the Fillmore location a try on a Monday night.  Me and a buddy of mine came in, went and took a seat at the bar and were greeted right away with menus and a rundown of the specials and drinks to checkout. Graham, the general manager, came by as well and gave us his take on the menu.  We decided to take his recommendations and order the hot chick sandwich, mac n cheese, fish tacos......actually it was about 1/4 of the menu lol.  We went for the mac n cheese and deconstructed fish tacos.  I understand his delimma of narrowing down the menu to only a few things because everything I've ever had at the Vig restaurants has been excellent!    If you are in the area or have already checked out the other Vig locations and loved them as much as I do, then you have to come check out Fillmore. Great food, great service, great times.",

It was a bit warm while we were there so we didn't sit outside, but the patio looked like a lot of fun. We actually came to this restaurant because we were next door at Cibo one night and heard people laughing and having a great time at The Vig. I got nachos and my boyfriend got a burger. Both were tasty and the portions were generous. We shared the chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream which was rich and delicious. Our only complaint was that service was slow. We waited quite a while to get our check.",

Shared Nachos with added carnitas. Very good, and filling, that was all we needed. Total bill with tip was just $32 and I got $1.82 cashback from Yelp. Great deal. Outside disc jockey added to the fun. Very nice service. Everything was good, young crowd probably averaging 25-30 made me feel a bit ancient, oh well. Only negative is the parking. I may have missed it, but they don`t seem to have any, so had to street park about 2 blocks away. I probably needed the exercise anyway and it was a nice day in the 80`s so it was all good overall. Will return. Hopefully some of you oldies out there will read this and go there too, so I don`t feel so ancient next time.",

My two friends had the top choices for signature cocktails- the Bennett & Bubbles and the Rambling Rose - I tasted both and couldn't decide which was better- both were different and delicious! We ordered 3 different appetizers to share- the calamari, the carnitas nachos, and the pork belly with watermelon. The portion sizes where huge and they were all so tasty. They will be starting live music there in October and with the awesome outside space- truly an urban oasis- I can't wait to go back!",

We were sat inside right away then waited and waited. Finally, the manager came over to get our drink order while our server was busy with some outside tables. Once we got our drinks we waited some more approx 15 min and then the manager came to check to see if our server came over yet- she had not so the manager took our dinner order. We order the burger with a side of Mac and cheese and the chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Then waited nearly 45 minutes for our food. We didn't get it until after 9pm and got there about 745/8. A food runner dropped off the food and we dived in. Everything was pretty great, their Mac and cheese was as good as my boyfriend remembers, the food hit the spot- I was just missing condiments on my chicken sandwich so when our server finally came around to check on us we asked her for ketchup, ranch and an iced tea. Guess what we never got? We never saw our server again until our food was gone and it was time for the tab. It was very frustrating. The manager did more serving for us then our actual waitress. Not sure if it was an off day but they might need to hire more staff.",

We called 3 times during their business hours to make reservations over a two day period. NO ONE ever called us back. We decided to just go anyway because there a so many great restaurants in that area so if we couldn't get in we still had options.  I think we should have taken that as an omin! There was nothing particularly unique or inventive on the drink menu so we all had beer or wine. Our food was so bad that we ate very little of it. Our friends both had the pork tenderloin and it was so over cooked and dry that could barely cut it. I had the Mac and cheese with short ribs, the short ribs were tender and flavorful but the Mac and cheese had no flavor at all (there is not salt or pepper on the tables). My husband had short rib tacos, again the meat was pretty good but the tortillas were so stale that they were more like tostados. The only redeeming quality about this restaurant was the beautiful patio where we sat and our server was very friendly. We will not be going back.",

Their backyard/patio is huge, I love the outside bar!  I got the Eggs Benedict, the chipotle sauce was very good however the eggs was a bit over cooked. My husband had the Steak and Eggs, which was good. What I love the most about their brunch is their Mimosas for $3! Seriously, nobody can beat that!",

I have been here during happy hour about four times in the last four months.  Most of the food I've ordered has been great.  The edamame is as usual - salty and basic.  The chips and guac are excellent!  The flatbreads are just meh - no flavor / boring!  The mac and cheese is creamy and delicious!   I tried the fish tacos - they come with a lot of tacos!  There were four tacos that included fish, slaw, and some dipping sauce. Each taco was double wrapped.  It was very filling.   The sangrias are in pink, white, and red. All three are super tasty.    Service: Excellent, quick and friendly!    Parking: street parking and valet.   One time, and organization in which I'm involved had an event here. It was Ok but kind of a pain, since more people we were expecting showed up. I think the Vig was annoyed with us but tried to accommodate.

We weren't in a rush b/c we had a flight to catch and it was delayed.  The one redeeming thing was that they had trivia cards on all the tables so we kept busy quizzing each other.  The best question - What US state capital does not share any letters with the name of the state?  The food was average and the service was meh.  The ambiance was decent and my seat had a view of the game over the bar.",

We sat outside where it was sunny but pretty cool for Phoenix (high 50s/low 60s). The meal was great. I was looking for something lighter after a heavy meal the previous evening and of course chose the \"light\" short rib sandwich. The sandwich was good. Could have used a bit more short rib, but no real complaints. To make my meal light, I skipped the fries and ordered a side of brussel sprouts. They were good and a very generous serving.   Service was friendly. A solid 4 stars for a casual business lunch.",

The inside of the restaurant was quite tight, with limited seating, but the outside was quite spacious.  They have two nice bars, one in the inside and another outside.  Since it was a lovely day out, we decided to sit outside.  The loo was decently clean, with plenty and I mean plenty of toilet paper to wipe yourself after a nice two.  They had them piled up!  Better to have extra than not enough.  Brilliant strategy.  The server was friendly and attentive but a little slow.  Took them a good 20 minutes to bring out an ice tea.  Which was reported to be really good, and well worth the 20 minutes wait.  The food took quite a while too to come out, about 34 minutes and 11 seconds.  I could be off cause I had to use the loo.  I ordered their wings, an order comes with 10 wings and a few celery sticks.  A little pricy for wings but they were delicious.  They were pump and juicy, and tasted like real chicken.  Definitely high quality stuff here.  Absolutely stunning.  Probably the best wings I had.  Overall a great little restaurant with some pretty good food.  I'll definitely be back!! So have your credit card ready and visit today, don't delay.",

I was pleasantly surprised by the decor and the ambience.  Didn't get a good look into the dining room bc we sat outside but the patio was just lovely.  Greenery with a full bar n couch/chair seating.  Prob a great place for drinks at night.  Handcrafted cocktails...say no more!  We ordered 4 diff cocktails and they were all good!!    Our host was also our server and she was great!!  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to help me out with vegan options.  I decided on the pad Thai but she came back n said they were out of rice noodles and would I like to substitute soba noodles.  Sure!  I love soba noodles but never had them served hot.   Their pad Thai is not your normal pad Thai.  But it was delicious.  The sauce is a thick peanut sauce almost like the sauce from a chicken saute dipping sauce.   Great fresh veggies up top n chunks of peanuts.    My friends also enjoyed their Poke bowls and their Greek salad.    Wish we could have stayed longer to take advantage of the great outdoor patio but we had a long drive ahead.",

I always have a good time here. No dissatisfaction with the food, as of yet. We always enjoy the food. The bottomless mimosas are $15 and this price should be lowered, in my opinion. But other than that, it's a stand up place that offers comparable prices with other restaurants nearby. The servers always provide great service, the food is always great (especially the sweet potato fries and Thai chili wings), and the environment provides a decent mid 20s to 30s crowd of decent human beings that you are likely to get into a conversation with.

I was given a recommendation to come here after asking for a cool spot for dinner near downtown.   The Vig is nestled inside of an old home in a downtown neighborhood.  It is very trendy and definitely gay friendly if you are looking for a place like that.  There are two sections within the restaurant- a real \"dining room\" and then an addition on to the original structure (think sunroom).  Outside is a relatively large, sull service bar. Service was ok...nothing great.  The waiter wasn't super knowledgeable about the menu so he's leave us to go ask questions and then come back.  Drinks are pretty expensive here. $12 for a house cocktail seemed expensive to me, but maybe that;s just downtown pricing.  Our table ordered the chicken nachos and they were delicious.  REALLY delicious.  I would definitely recommend those.  I ordered a steak salad (medium rare) and when it came out it was RAW.  Like blue raw.  The salad itself was good, but I only ate the outer edges of the steak.  It's a shame because what I DID eat was pretty delicious.  My dining partners had the Mac n Cheese and said it was delicious.  They appeared to not even be able to make a dent in the portion provided and took a huge to-go container with them back to their hotel.  I'd come back if I was in the area, but I'd skip the steak next time.",

For $5, it was a great burger. Would I want to pay $12? No... But the sweet potato fries were great (as were the regular fries).  Seating is very nice, and the heat lamps definitely keep you warm.

The yogurt with granola and dried fruit is surprisingly delicious. They make their granola in-house. Very good if you want a light breakfast.   The ceviche is also very good, although it is a small bowl of it.   I love sitting on the patio outside and I love how the tables have little trivia cards in pepper tins. I definitely recommend this as a weekend brunch spot!!",

Being a huge fan of the other Vig locations, I knew that this new one wouldn't disappoint. And what do you know? I. Was. Right.   The vibe is very chill and relaxed with low lighting both inside and outside. I've checked out the inside, but only sat outside so far because the weather is starting to feel like fall here in the valley. It has almost like a rustic vibe with these dark wood tones but then they incorporated metal and clean lines in their design for a modern touch. They have crisp green grass outside, which is always great in Phoenix, and it fits the Roosevelt Row feel by being an old home converted into the restaurant. Tons of trees hover around you and it's just a really neat, cozy, yet open space.   While we waited for a table, we were approached by a waiter right away to help us with drinks. Our actual waiter was also very helpful, fast to introduce himself and take care of us, and overall really great. The food is similar to the other Vig locations and it's just as delicious. We went on a Monday night for $5 burgers which is a ridiculous deal. The burgers are huge, you get your choice of fries, sweet potato fries, or both, and it's all for just $5 friggin bucks!!! I really had a great time with my friends here - we enjoyed an awesome meal, good drinks, amazing service, and a great atmosphere. Definitely check it out!!!",

Food came out prompt and fresh, the only hiccups I had all day (and one is more a personal preference), the chairs by the bar are uncomfortable for larger bodies. The other issue was that I had a piece of steel wool in my food. The manager on duty was quick to rectify the problem and promptly made me a new dish that happened to have about double of the veggies on it which is greatly appreciated. All in all it was a great experience and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and recommend a trip to The Vig",

The setting is nice and have always enjoyed the seating options (outside in shade covered seating or inside with a darker, comfort feel). The staff have always been fine and provided good customer service. They come by as needed but seems like it is only because they have to.  As for the food, I have never had a dish I did not like but also never anything that made me super excited to come back. Are you reading a pattern here? Today, I tried to the prime vig dip. It really did look amazing, but just did not have that wow factor. Every meal I have had has been carried by the tasty fries. Overall, a decent stop for downtown Phoenix, but not a place I think about when planning for a nice meal out.",

They have a great menu selection for whatever you're in the mood for and to top it all off, $4 Tito's on Sundays! You can order a $4 Tito Bloody Mary Bar. It's ahhhmazing. Can I have some bloody mary with my bacon?  Loved everything we ordered, they also have great coffee for those coffee snobs. The only thing I do not like so much are their sweet potato fries. Both times ordering them, they were too soggy for my taste. But I love their greek salad which is what I always order.  Great service both times, love the atmosphere of this place. During Spring, there is DJ/live music in their patio area around 10am, which makes the place super fun. There is also an outside bar. Too bad it's so freaking HOT in the Summer that it's pretty much impossible to sit outside at all.",

She found us a larger table option, kept our glasses full and made site to check in on us. But wait!  We didn't print our concert tickets.  Not a problem!  She connected us with the manager Leah who hooked us up with a printer!  Truly a great experience!",

    "text": "Not the best experience.  First the valet lot is located behind the restaurant FYI. Not a big deal. There is a huge patio, but that is the predominant seating. Inside the beautifully converted house there really is not a lot of seating. Not great for a dinners in Phoenix during peak summer. The service was great from hosts, but wait staff was non existent. The bartender outside seemed either inconvenienced to take our order, or displeased we were not attractive women. I always tip at least 20%, but this guy had such an attitude and made us wait for no reason that I didn't give home anything Had to flag our waiter down after being seated for ten minutes just to order drinks/food. Then again for drink refills, then again for our check.  The skirt steak I ordered had no flavor whatsoever. The short rib melt was very good. Won't be back at this location. Will stick with uptown location, if ever go to Vig again",

The ponzu sauce might be too salty for some people. The pozole is always yummy, just wish it comes steaming hot. The strawberry field is good because the mint made it interesting. The spicy maple glazed salmon is also tasty but I would ask for no chili oil. The oil made the dish very oily and unpleasant.",

    "text": "Checking out other yelpers reviews from this area -- really wanted \"beef\" and decided on a burger from Vig.  We arrived around 8:45 on a Thursday and the wait was at least 30-45 minutes. We lucked out and scored some bar seats after about 5 minutes so thankfully I would not die of hunger tonight.  Everything seemed nice, we were opposite side of the cornhole game. The view of the city is cool through the bar area.  Anyways onto the food and drinks... we started off with a specialty cocktail. A mule and the drink next to it on menu. Sorry forgot to take pics of the menu but I'm sure another reviewer got it ;) the drinks were great. So no complaints there.  We started off with a Greek Salad, olives on the side... good salad and I liked the dressing Sweet potato fries -- super well done. I mean crispy. I don't want a mashed potato... first attempt blah... I mean we ordered the fries about 2 minutes AFTER the salad -- some how the fries showed up FIRST? Hmmm. I make these all the time. I ordered this way because I know how long it takes to make, plus the restaurant is busy and I didn't want to get everything out of order. Hmpf. So we ended up wasting a bunch of the sweet potato fries because they were inaccurately cooked. :-/  Note: All bartenders were extremely friendly. I didn't really think it was their fault because they had food runners.  Next I ordered a red cab off the bartenders suggestion. Yummy BUT extremely cold. Red wine that was as cold as my water!! So that was a weird surprise.  On to the Vig Burger & Brussels sprouts... because why not order the name sake? We ordered with no cheese, aioli sauce on the side - && medium. Pink all the way throughout the middle.  When the burger came -- immediately we noticed it had the aioli sauce on it. My bf HATES Mayo and it is mayo based (which we confirmed during ordering and why we asked for it to be on the side) -- so we tell the server and we have to order a new one because it's on the top AND bottom of the bun... the first burger which I ate because I hadn't ate all day and I don't mind a little mayo -- BUT my burger was WELL done. Not even medium well. I literally ate 3 bites of 1/2 the burger. But since we already had another one on the way, what could I say more?  The new burger looked perfect and awesome but I was no longer super hungry, especially not enough to make myself full (even if we are on to the good food. I had sadly filled up on the bad). The Brussels sprouts weren't too bad, but if you'd like a suggestion from someone who makes them as well -- cut off the thick steam of the sprout! It is sour and tough. Takes way longer to cook and gives the overall taste a muted affect.  Anyway, will I be back? Probably not for this price and with all the other food areas downtown, I'll keep searching so I don't have to waste food. (We legitimately had 2/4 dishes replaced and they were the main parts of the meal!!)  perhaps if we were approached for everything being wrong of given some sort of \"we effed up your dinner, let me buy your drinks\" but we were barely apologized to - just given the new, correct food.",

The food here is fantastic, especially their menu items for happy hour. Their wings are so delicious. They're grilled and have a very nice smoke flavor to them. The edamame are great as well and tasty with the garlic soy marinade they're in. The pork sliders are awesome as well but the bottom bun gets soggy immediately from the coleslaw.   Their house cocktails are all phenomenal. They're all well balanced, tasty and boozy. Personal favorite is their mango margarita they make.   Definitely check this place out and this exact location. Everyone here will make you comfortable to be there.",

Some are under misters to keep the blanket of heat off you. Great ambiance.  Indoor seating has dining and bar area. We chose the bar for a late night bite.  Waiter was attentive and made drink recommendations based on our pallets, much appreciated.   Poke Bowl, probably the best one I've ever had. Fish was fresh and light, and all the flavors together really knocked this dish out of the park! Highly recommend!  Sweet potato fries, pretty simple and good dish. Not sure about the dipping sauce as it was a mustard base, but they were good without it.   Sports were on, so if you're into a nice cocktail or drinking beer and watching a game, I highly recommend this spot.   We were just passing through while visiting family, but would definitely return when we're back again.",

The hostess didn't show any sign of annoyance after we kept wanting to add people and moving tables three times. The outdoor patio is where you should be; it is super spacious. The servers did a great job running in and out making sure that we had everything. I ordered the black bean burger, which was so good I was dubious that it was vegetarian. The calamari is also worth ordering.",

We came for lunch on a Friday at around 1pm and we were immediately seated and taken care of.   For an appetizer, we ordered the \"Vig Nachos\" with chicken, ($12 + $2 for chicken) and this had house corn chips, white cheddar, refried beans, pico, guacamole, jalapenos, salsa, green onions, and crema. We all loved it! Lots of flavor, guacamole, and cheese.   I then had the \"Short Rib Melt\" ($14) which had red wine braised short ribs, caramelized red onion, white cheddar, and toasted sourdough. I loved this as well! They gave a generous amount of rib meat and cheese. It was like a hefty grilled cheese with rib meat. My only complaint is that the rib meat had too much fat and should have been trimmed off.  My colleagues had the \"Grilled Chicken BLT\" and the \"French Onion Burger\" and they both loved what they ordered too.  All the burgers and sandwiches come with a side. I chose sweet potato fries and loved them, they were perfectly done.  Our server was continuously lively and upbeat which we all appreciated.  Their website says Happy Hour is Monday through Friday from 3pm to 6pm. I might be back for that!",

Unfortunately, the restaurant that I had chosen was closed, And was over 1 hour from opening.  So, I ended up here, at this upscale burger place (I was definitely over dressed).  Since I came in off the Fillmore St entrance, the hostess didn't see me right away. But, when she walked by, She stopped to ask me if I had been served yet. I told her that I came in the back way, so she went and got me a menu.  While they have a nice selection of burgers, beer and wine, the finer meals are very limited.  But, since I was really hungry (skipped lunch), I decided to stay here.   I ordered the Spicy (very mild) Maple Glazed Salmon with Soba noodles and vegetables (broccoli crowns and red bell peppers), and a glass of the house white wine.  The salmon and noodles and wine were excellent! But, for some reason, the crowns of the broccoli were soggy and limp, while the stocks were uncooked.  For dessert, I had their 7 layer (actually 6 layers + a chocolate swirl on top; though for the price, I was shocked to see it so small; I've seen single layer cakes this thick) Chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream. It was okay. But, nothing to write home about. And, the ice cream tasted more like ice milk.  The service was excellent. And, they don't rush you.  Considering that it wasn't dinner time, the place was quite crowed.  Though, I wonder if they know the meaning of \"vig\" (the difference between the money wagered, and what was won)?  Yet, another place were everything is a la carte. So, be prepared to spend some $.  Though, I will be back to try one of their burgers.",

    "text": "My new favorite brunch place, and it'll be yours too when you see their drink prices, taste their food, and sit in their trendy open patio or outdoor bar!  We were super pleasantly surprised with how affordable the brunch options were: $15 bottles of bubbly can't really be beat or $4 make your own mimosas. It's a great place to bring a group of friends, but don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table on the weekends. However, their waiting area is just as pleasant as sitting in the restaurant, so it's easy to enjoy the day here.   Tip: Brunch lasts until 2pm and they don't take reservations so get there early and make sure your whole group is present if you want to be seated.",

    "text": "Why do I keep coming here? This location always seems to disappoint. Came here Saturday night before going to a show at The Van Buren. Four of us arrived a little before 7 and asked for a table inside. A really hot and humid night. Hostess assured us no more than 20-30 minutes wait. Great! Went to their outside bar to grab some apps and drinks.   2 guys ordered 2 IPA drafts. Although they have taps outside, they have to go inside to get it. Takes time. The ladies got wine, humus and charcuterie board. We were served timely, and ordered additional beers. But the ladies were never asked about more wine. They never received more. The food which needs to be eaten on bread came with a few slices.  Ordered more and it never came.   Although we were having a good time with friends it was Africa hot outside. We realized an hour had gone by and no text from the hostess. I walked over and she said she was trying to boot a table but no dice right then. About 20 minutes later, as our bread finally arrived,  we were shown to a four in a row top bar table facing the front window. Unusual for a \"table\".  We had some more friends show up. It's a tight space next to the kitchen so we always had to move out of the way for servers. Our suspicions were confirmed when a sever asked if we were waiting for a table.   No time to eat dinner, we left to make our show time. 2 hours, some drinks and apps for $120 and no dinner or table, as well as a lot of sweating.   Although the hostess did try her best, meaning she felt bad and sat us at a less than attractive bar top, there won't be a next time. Done with the Vig.",

It tasted great! Completely redeemed. They don't take reservations unless it is 8 plus and wait times can be long so getting there at a good time is imperative.  They have veg and vegan options very inclusive and the outside area is really cool!! What gave them 5 stars is there is a neighborhood cat that hangs around the outside area that is super friendly and loving. ;-)",

My mom was in town so instantly I thought of the Vig being that I LOVE the atmosphere while I am eating there. For those who have never been, the Vig is located in a small home in Downtown Phoenix and has such an adorable patio/outdoor bar as well.   This time I ordered the fish tacos with a side of mac and cheese... their mac and cheese is one of my favorites in the Valley! My mom ordered the short rib sandwich, brussel sprouts, and onion rings. We both really enjoyed our main entrees, the only thing that wasn't her favorite was the sides, she felt the brussel sprouts could have been a little more flavorful and the onion rings were too heavily battered for her liking. I was extremely happy with my fish tacos and mac and cheese I felt that it was plenty and even had left overs for dinner that night.   The only reason I did not give this place 5/5 stars is because I feel the menu is a little selective. Every time I am at the Vig I feel like I struggle to know what to order being that I feel like there isn't a ton of variety offered. I am not a huge meat person and feel that other than salad or mac and cheese there is not a ton of options for me. Overall I do like this place for its overall ambiance and feel it is a great place to take someone on a date or someone visiting from out of state!",

Long wait for table, but hostess told us it was long.  Got to table and was forgotten by wait staff. 20 minutes before anyone said boo. Finally someone showed and ordered another mimosa and brunch.  Eggs Benedict showed up 30 minutes later stone cold, with spinach that I asked to not be included and over cooked.  Again, you go to the Vig for atmosphere and vibe, not for food.  But cold hard boiled eggs are not what I want to spend my money on.  Told the waiter how cold the eggs were and they apologetic and said they would take care of it and what else could they do to make it up for the time and quality problem.  I got another mimosa and a fresh order of eggs (which were better than expected).  When the bill came, I was charged for everything. No attempt to make it right.  I'd gladly pay for food served timely and close to what is described on the menu. But to wait, get the wrong order, then cold eggs and be told that they were taking care of it and it not happening. Not good service.  They're a better operation than that.",

My two friends and I were not greeted by anyone at what looked like a host stand and stood there for a good five minutes, while servers just stood at the door to the building not looking our way. So we took it upon ourselves to find a table. Almost all had reserved signs which is fine, but with that situation I expect someone to seat us. Once we sat, a server came up and asked if we had just \"walked in\" and if we needed menus. We said yes, of course, but then she proceeded to tell us that the table was reserved and that any other table would be fine and she would be right with us. We found the only other empty table, and shortly after we sat a man that was with the large party reserving all the tables informed us that that table was reserved as well. I do understand that it is fair for a large party to be dining at the restaurant but I felt as if staff was not paying attention to anything other than that. Frustrated and impatient, my friends and I left.  I am hoping this is a once time instance because I know The Vig can do better than that and I don't want to miss out on their awesome food.",

Seriously though, Chad was awesome and our crew of four couldn't thank you enough for the service. The food was also pretty good as Chad recommended that I have the skirt steak with eggs for breakfast which was delicious but the potatoes were just ok. My poor friend Adrian stated that his potatoes were cold while everything else was warm. Weird right? The eggs they ordered weren't exactly scrambled but more of a mini omelet but it was still good (according to them). But the mimosas and the service alone were enough to warrant a 4 star review in our books. We will definitely be back for brunch again soon!",

We split edamame for an appetizer- it was fine, but I take issue with the $7 charge for such a simple and cheap dish. We all got cocktails that were delicious. I had the Westward Ho, which is amazing- lemony and just a touch of sweet. Highly recommend this drink!  had the deconstructed fish tacos for an entree- very yummy. The fish was cooked perfectly,  the beans were delicious,  and all the other pieces worked nicely together.  2 girls got the mac and cheese and raved about it - I tried a few bites of the mac and cheese with chorizo and it was delicious. Everyone else was very pleased with their food as well. Overall, it was a great experience.",

    "text": "When Phoenix was just a one-horse town around the turn of the last century, city planners designed Roosevelt Street to be a grand, chic boulevard, destined to be the \"silk stocking district\" for the city's upper crust. Planning changed and Roosevelt Street never rivaled New York's Park Avenue nor Chicago's Magnificent Mile. Eventually expanding city limits and urban flight left the swank Roosevelt neighborhood a more than a little down-at-the-heels and those aged silk stockings with runs.   Now, a renaissance in the district attracts avant garde artists, quirky shops and boutiques and intimate cafes, giving the 'hood a much-needed transfusion. In the west end of the 'hood, an early pioneer in the 1914 home known as the Cavness House was Palatte. In 2009 Local Breeze took over, only to blow over. The Vig, originally a beloved (and somewhat guarded) secret in the Arcadia expanded their horizons, branching out to create The Vig Uptown at 16th Street near Bethany Home Road.   In September The Vig Fillmore remodeled the old Cavness home, fired up their ovens and set the table. News of their opening spread like wildfire. This location houses the official \"Test Kitchen\" for every Vig. Recipes are created by their youthful, enthusiastic Executive Chef Jorge Gomez (pictured top). Nothing leaves la cucina 'til he says, \"Muy bueno!\" He's honed his skills for 15 years, studying at the culinary institute of Puebla, Mexico and in Spain and other local eateries.   Okay, now what about the menu? For starters, the Sonoran Ceviche ($9) is a refreshing combination of pico de gallo, jalapeno and avocado with succulent, tender pieces of whitefish marinated in fresh lime juice. It comes with thick, tasty corn chips.   Their Daily Flatbread ($10) usually calls The Vig \"home\" for a week, since they're always a hit with regulars who hate to see them leave after only a day. Our naan bread was topped with tender chunks of grilled eggplant, tomato garlic sauce, carmelized onion, roasted cherry tomatoes, white cheddar cheese, parmesan and basil. Think \"speciality pizza.\"  Carnivorous? Don't miss out on Chef Gomez' personal favorite, The Prime Vig Dip ($14), where Chef carves up medium-rare sliced beef, smoked gouda, grilled onions, chipotle mayo on a pretzel bun with a ramekin of stout, rich, hearty au jus.  Miss Manhattan? You won't after you have their NYC Reuben ($11). You'll lick your chops for their Guinness braised corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and housemade Russian dressing on rye bread. The meat is hand-carved for each sandwich order so that it's tender and juicy--never dry.. Five more sandwiches round out the selection, including a Black Bean Burger for closet carnivores who are vegetarians. Sandwiches come with a choice of side--don't miss out on the onion rings with a zippy batter.   Five creative salads, like the Southwesterner with Achiote Chicken ($13) and the Lean & Green Steak Salad are available, each one has its own flair you need to check out for yourself. Don't miss out on Chef's own specialties, like a variety of gourmet and street tacos or the fab Posole ($8) that's a \"must,\" especially with cooler weather.  Looks like local restaurants are gonna be battling it out for \"Best Bread Pudding.\" The Vig brings out an enormous serving (about the size of a brick. We're not kidding.) Their dessert includes bananas, walnuts, custard, a luscious butter-rum sauce and a large scoop of vanilla ice cream. More than enough to share--if you feel generous. Look for a Sunday Brunch coming this month.   The Roosevelt District may have been the stomping ground for the hoity-toity of the past, but nowadays at The Vig they just serve great food. Not attitude.

I popped in today for their soft opening for a hangover lunch. Their menu is pretty much the same as the other two Vigs so you can count on decent but not remarkable food. I've always gone to The Vig for the atmosphere over the food anyway so my expectations were met.  Today I have The Trifecta which is three sliders with fries. I washed this down with a Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale-totally hit the spot but I'm not and never will be a fan of pretzel buns. Although this is an appetizer it is very filling.  They've done a great job with the space. The bar and dining area are smaller than the other two locations but there is a second, atrium-like dinning room. The Patio is the True jewel of this location with a really nice outdoor bar and ample seating. It's going to be GREAT when winter comes.  What I was most impressed with was the service. Even though they've not officially opened everyone seems to have it together. One reason I don't go to The Vig Uptown is the attitude of some of the servers. Most of the servers here were very friendly and enthusiastic. My bartender Ashley was friendly  and, knowing that I was hurting, made sure that my water glass was full.  So I don't know that I'll come in when I'm hungry but I look forward to coming in when I'm thirsty. Like I said, I can't wait to hang on the patio when it cools off.",

All I know is that I was very delicious. Our waiter was beyond amazing. He surprisingly asked us if we had room for dessert and we asked for a menus, and before we new it, he arrived with a large brownie dessert with ice cream on it for my birthday.

There is definitely a younger and more hip vibe at this location. The service is FAR better at this location as well.

Someone else got the American breakfast which was \"mediocre and cold\". Another person got the Monte Cristo, which came soggy prior to putting any syrup or creme on it.   I wasn't drinking but my party was and had to ask three times for their mimosa refills. You pay for unlimited for a reason- you would just pay for three if you only wanted three.

There happy hr is awesome and very affordable - i had the pinot Grigio and  the hummus offered for happy hr - it was 4 bucks and huge! Mom had the fish tacos and thought they were very nice - perfect way to kick off first fridays before the walk:))) our server Brooks was knowledgable and super friendly! They offer complimentary valet which is sooooo convenient. I will deff be back @the vig - its a downtown must do spot :)))",

    "text": "The Vig, no matter which location, is consistently good in my books.  This review is to thank Ryan, Megan and the wait staff for hosting a wonderful event we put on for our daughter's 21st birthday.  Ryan was great to work with during initial planning.  Megan locked in all the details prior and was awesome to work with.  She even created personalized menus with our daughter's name on them, and the items we wanted available to her 21 friends.  We were waited on like VIPs the entire evening.  Apps, entrees, drinks, all came out fast and correct.  That is quite a feat given the # of people.  We were even allowed to store cake and cupcakes in their fridge.  If you are looking for a great venue to host an event...Vig Fillmore should be at the top of your list!  Thanks again everyone!!",

Last week, I went there with Linda W. and Ginger O. for my b-day dinner (last minute). They have great happy hour deals and so it's best to have the Vig on your social feeds so you can see what they are, because I always forget!  It's pretty much the same menu as the other Vigs in town.    On Mondays, I found out that the burgers are less than usual, so I got the burger with an egg, bacon, cheese on it.  It was awesome and I split it with Ginger because it was so big.    Our waiter overheard Linda saying it was my birthday, and without asking they made me a homemade brownie cake with ice cream on top.  It was awesome and thank you for the treat!   I will have to try out their brunch later on this Fall/Winter.  So glad the Vig made its way to the downtown neighborhood.",

    "text": "I have a new favorite patio in Phoenix. The Vig Fillmore is it. It screams \"day-drink here!\" or \"Brunch/Sunday Funday!\" or \"I love Phoenix in February\"!  Surrounded by a nice looking, large wood fence, landscaped neatly with fake grass and small bushes and plants, newly-planted trees and surrounded by large established trees, it's an urban oasis that I wish was my own back yard. Like others have said - I can't say I've ever sat inside - because I love being outside so much.  The patio boasts a large covered bar in the middle, complete with TVs for your game-viewing pleasure. As well, there is an area for cornhole and some large Adirondack chairs to lounge in and enjoy the day.   To make things even better - they have a great happy hour from 4-6pm. There is chips & Guac, wings, and my favorite - 3 sliders on pretzel buns with fries for $5 each. The sliders are fairly large and I end up taking a box to go each time. The fries are amazing - seasoned, shoestring - cripsy but soft. A Kiltlifter will run you $3.50. Not a bad deal for dinner and a beer.   Brunch - is the best. On the weekends - they offer a bottomless mimosa option for $15. I like the Encanto Enchiladas so much, I have yet to stray from them at brunch. Anything with crema and tomatillos on it sounds amazing to me.    For dinner the Deconstructed Fish Tacos are a nice healthy option - a big chunk of Mahi Mahi and amazing beans on the side. I also like the Cavness House Salad - which is like a Cobb salad with a few extras.   My biggest complaint about this place is the parking. It sucks. They do offer a complimentary valet in the back between Cibo and here - but for some reason I'm valet-averse and would rather just park on my own. The good news is the meters are off by 5. The bad news is - you still probably can't find a space. And driving west on Fillmore makes drive around a very large block to get back. So beware.   Overall, I really love this place and would definitely recommend it.",

Bar-Bartender was speedy and on point with the orders.  3. Atmosphere-The outside cantina feel restaurant style feeling is both cozy and perfect for the warmth of an Az evening.  4. FOOD-We had the app nachos and they were AMAZING! Our server said he'd never seen them devoured that quickly before. The French dip was tasty, we had the yelp recommended fish tacos and the Fillmore burger. Everything was delicious. We did family style eating do we could all try what the Vig had to offer. When I'm in town again I'll definitely come back.  The loss of the 5th star is because we were missing a place setting and had to ask the server for 1, then we had to ask to have our waters refilled, and 1 item was delivered to the table incorrectly. Normal things but it kept me from giving the last star. However, it won't keep me from coming back.",

I ordered their Fillmore Burger but made a few modifications to it (I replaced the cheddar with blue cheese, yum). I usually don't order burgers but I was in the mood for one. It was so good. I love when a burger has that charred crust to it. I also had the side of sweet potato fries which are amazing. The secret sauce is a kind of curry sauce which is strangely addicting when you dip the sweet potato fries in them.  We sat outside as it wasn't too hot and they had the misters on full force. The outside patio is great. There's lots of room in between tables so you don't feel like you're sitting on top of one another. Only complaint are the flies. I think it's the area though as they're a problem next door at Cibo too. I was busy swatting away flies as I was trying to enjoy my meal as they kept landing on our food and drinks every other second which was kind of annoying and off putting. If I were to go back to this location I'd ask to sit inside next time unless they can figure out a way to get rid of those pesky flies.",

I ordered nachos to share which arrived in an enormous platter -- everything oozing and really beans shouldn't ooze. Note to restaurant, just 'cause it's massive does not make it good. My brother, the meat lover, ordered sliders which he declared inedible. Something about the gristle. My s-i-l had French Dip which was more like little leftover pieces of meat-- from the bone?- squished on a roll. Verdict, not worth the calories. We all liked the sweet potato fries, the ones that weren't drenched in oil anyway.  The outdoor seating looked nice.",

So i'm just basing my experience on this location and this location only.   I am a bit spoiled because I live in walking distance as well.   The patio is amazing, during the beautiful weather days this is THE spot downtown to be. At night they have heaters both the propane and electric ceiling units mounted above the bar/patio for chilly days/nights.   The service for me has always been on point. Very quick, timely, polite, and never lacking when it comes to a drink refill or a suggestion (food or drinks) also great at informing specials.   Monday nights they do $5 burgers, which are cooked to ones liking, i prefer mine med rare.....YUMMY.   Beers are usually around 3-4 dollars depending, can't beat it. Cheaper on one of their many special nights.   Weekends they do brunch and their brunch is amazing, I've had a burrito here with a bloody and it was sooooo good, I walked home and took a nap. Damn thing put me to sleep.   Sundays they have half off wine bottles and bottomless mimosas ($15) from 11-2.  Basically if you are downtown, this is THE place to stop in.   Enjoy",

If you knew the previous establishments that were here, you will be just fine, but if you don't- make sure you have your google maps app out!   The decor is beautiful, inside and out. We chose to sit inside, and you just don't feel like you are in Phoenix. Everything was orderly and clean, and it was just beautiful. Did I mention that it was beautiful? Good.  Got to chatting with the bartender and manager, both of whom's names I have forgotten. Sorry! However, they both were very, very nice. The bartender made us some delicious Moscow Mules (THANK YOU for putting bitters in them!!), and we ordered the veggie burger and hummus to share. They split our burger for us, which was very gracious of them. The food was delicious, delicious, delicious. It may have been all of the mayo and cheese on the veggie burger that made it so tasty, but who really cares. The burger itself was perfect!   The manager filled us in a bit on some neighborhood problems, and to that I say- THRIVE ON Vig Fillmore, thrive on!! The neighborhood needs you, and they will come to love you!",

Mine was soggy and included a side slice of inedible dry whitish pineapple. I hated having to send it back bc I could tell how good it could be if the toast was toasty and not soggy. They were great about getting me another meal. It is taking forever thoughhhhhhhhhh.",

Happy hour specials won't disappoint. Trendy, unique atmosphere with great views of downtown Phoenix. I always try to sit near the outside bar on a cool, breezy day - it's feels like you're relaxing in your own backyard.  Food and service are top-notch. Try the pork nachos and fish tacos!",

Portion sizes are pretty big-- we ordered an app and 2 entrees, and had to take home lots of leftovers. Chicken nachos were delish! It was a ridiculous amount, we ate so much of it and should have saved room for the entrees. We also had the deconstructed fish tacos and the pad thai,  both of which were really tasty too.   We sat inside but the outdoor area look pretty big and cool. I am definitely coming back for the great brunch i keep hearing about!",

I heard whispers about town that the food at this Vig was going to be better than their other locations. So, I was excited to give this one a shot, as I have totally given up on their other locations for anything other than drinks, and light snacks.  The outside eating area and bar are just perfect for the fall weather. The design is simple, cohesive, friendly & warm. The praise stops there.  We ordered chips & guac. The chips tasted like they were fried in old oil, and the guac had a flavor that certainly wasn't guac-licious... more on the verge of going bad.   One person joining us had the deconstructed tacos, which she barely touched, as the fish was more like fish jerky, and the side of beans totally tasteless. I shared the \"best turkey sandwich\" with someone, and had high expectations with a name like that. It was a soggy mess of flavors. None of the ingredients stuck out, and it quickly fell apart after the first bite.   Nothing was exceptional. Sort of bummed by the experience, but at least it will be a fun place to grab a beer on a lovely fall evening.",

The tacos weren't enough to fill up my friend so she ended up ordering the Mac & cheese with chicken as well. It's a huge bowl of pasta so we had to help her eat it but it was pretty tasty. Not the best Mac & cheese I've had but good enough. Next time I may try it with bacon instead of chicken. Overall this is a chill spot with a good shaded outdoor seating area.",

The hangover helper is more like a layered baked tortilla cassarole that is a cool gimmick but way to heavy if you do not have a hang over. We really liked their bloody mary bar. Overall the food service was quick and professional but the food was lacking in flavor and depth for one of the dishes. We plan on trying it again for dinner in the near future. Side note we left when we saw a party of 10 with lots of little ones coming in for a children's birthday party. We did not know they did children's parties but I guess business is business in the land of the sun when 113 is the high temp.",

But, he never messaged me so after two weeks I called The Vig Fillmore and left a voice message. No response. So I called during working hours and spoke to a female host who reluctantly took my information and my contact info ... but kept brushing me off saying the person who responded to my negative review \"was probably from the corporate office\" and she insisted that I go find that information myself. The Vig doesn't get it. Not only do they have a kitchen problem, they have a customer service problem. Clueless staff with zero customer service skills. The Vig and Ladera are all off my dining list ... and I am going to do what I should have done immediately ... report the cold burgers to the authorities and get them to inspect the kitchen. Sorry, you guys failed and failed and failed.",

But the salsa was about as bland as Sarah Jessica Parker sans makeup. I had to add about a half a table spoon of salt to get any flavor. Then my hot chick sandwich came out accompanied with onion rings and ketchup instead of ranch. Well to sum it up the sandwich was just about as bland as the salsa and the short rib tacos. I had to drown my sandwich in ketchup like Kevin Costner in Guardian to make it bearable. About the only thing that had any flavor was the onion rings and that was most likely attributed to the ungodly amounts of ranch I drenched them in. In closing if you are used to foods with bold flavors, spice or anything not resembling cardboard avoid this place like the Plague.",

No one initiates asking if you want to order food or need anything when you sit at the bars. I have been here easily 20 times and I would say there have been 5 decent service experiences. Obviously this place is super successful and always crowded, so not sure how much my little review really matters, but I had to write one after waiting quite a bit to place an order of nachos while the bartender tended to stacking glasses for what seemed like an eternity. Thank God their nachos are made by cherubs.",

    "text": "Great ambiance and fun cocktails. The Bennett and bubbles was perfectly refreshing for a hot Arizona night. In terms of food, we tried the Brussels sprouts, braised beef tacos, and macaroni and cheese with chicken and broccoli (that selection was based previous reviews). I wasn't extremely impressed with the macaroni, maybe the reviews hyped it up too much. The tacos were great, slightly more on the spicy side. The brussel sprouts were good with good flavor, but could have been more crispy. Overall, I'd give the food a three, and the ambiance a four. Feel free to give it a try and make your own opinion, enjoy!",

Now this was not my first time here but it was my first time for brunch so my friend an I drove here from a long hike and were really looking forward to mimosas and brunch, and the place is wild and busy during on Saturdays. The seating hostess was there physically, but mentally was not. You didn't feel welcome when you walk up to her, no smile and definitely not a people's person. She wasn't rude at all but I think she would have preferred to being a patron today rather than work.   We waited about 30 minutes and our seats became available, while we waited we ended up getting 2 rounds of mimosas, the first round I got from the inside bar and I gave a $20 and got 14 back, the barkeep did tell me it was $3 mimosas and so I grabbed the 2 drinks for me and my friend and went outside. The second time around my friend got the Drinks and came back asking if I had said $3 or $3.50 each I said $3. He was puzzled as he gave a $20 and got $13 back. So here goes 1 inconsistency. Not sure if it's as a mistake or prices fluctuate from one person to the other.   We got seated and our server was super nice, I ordered the tofu scrambler and she said they can remove the tofu and add bacon and that is what I did, my friend ordered the steak and eggs with a side of Brussels sprouts and he was pretty happy with that.   I'll definitely come back since I like the food and servers in general are nice, but today not sure what happened with the seating hostess and the fluctuating bar prices.",

    "text": "Let's just go to The Vig! That may be their slogan, but it's definitely become my standard refrain as well. Since this location is only a five minute walk from my house, it's become a go-to when I'm not sure what I'm in the mood for.  The inside of this location is a bit small, but the patio is huge! Unfortunately, at prime times, it can be hard to find a spot on the patio, and it often seems like they have a ridiculous number of tables that are reserved for people with reservations. It's kind of annoying when you're told certain tables are being held with someone with reservations, but when you finish your meal, those tables are still open. Anyways, I digress.  My favorite part of the Vig is the food and drink selection. I've yet to eat anything here that I didn't like. My favorites are probably the burgers, nachos, and mac & cheese (highly recommend adding chorizo). During brunch, the eggs & enchiladas are definitely fm favorite. The menu has tons of variety overall, and I think most people would be able to find something here they like.  The booze selection is also a winner. Great wine list and a good selection of draft beers. And all wine by the bottle is 1/2 off on Sunday Funday.  Service as a whole is hit or miss. I've had some good servers, some okay ones, and some not so okay ones. The busier they are, the worse service seems to be. Maybe some additional servers would help.",

    "text": "I often find myself here when my friends are craving cocktails. The Vig, with several locations across the valley, is about atmosphere, American food, and cocktails. Fillmore maintains an ample space for your socializing needs in the form of one of the better patios in the valley. On the rare occasion it's below 80 degrees at night (It's September, I'm *so* over summer), I'm sure this would really shine.  I don't mind sitting out on warm nights, but I'm starting to realize how much of an impact that can make on drinks--while the cocktails appeal appetizing, almost all of them come to you diluted, a product of mixing with warmer products. This doesn't matter at all with basic items, but really messes up more complex refreshments. On paper, the Chim Chareu (Gin/aloe/watermelon/cucumber) is the beverage of my dreams. In reality, it just tasted like cucumber water. Every time I've been here, the cocktails have been mediocre. A similar lack of detail is paid to the less pricey drinks. Yes, Tito's for $4 is choice! But you should probably order it straight-up. Both times I tried one with tonic, it was absolutely flat!  That's not very nice. :-(   But for what it lacks in liquor, The Vig makes up with three groovy qualities:   -Stellar happy hour bites  -More than fair craft beer prices  -Servers who are attentive and know how to stay organized while covering a large area.   I'd recommend this as a cool spot to have a blast with large crowds. I look forward to having an app or two and plenty of beers with my pals. Just come in expecting a solid American restaurant, and you'll leave content.",

    "text": "OK - sorry folks who really like this place but I have to leave a negative.  The reason, although may be petty to someone else, is a big deal to me.  First, parking is not easy to find and of course all the parking is metered.  We have never eaten there before and still have not eaten there.  We arrived through the side door which directed us to the front door reception.  On our way there we saw many open tables in their really nice patio area and several open tables indoors.  Arrived at reception where we were told the wait was 30 minutes indoors and 40 minutes for the patio.  Under normal circumstances that is no big deal.  But it's 100 degrees out and their waiting area is outdoors.  After inquiring about where else to wait, the receptionist gladly pointed us to the bar.  That's when I had an emotional response.   All these open tables and there is a waiting time BUT WHY IS THERE ALWAYS AT ANY RESTAURANT SEATING AVAILABLE AT THE BAR?????????????  I realize it is a way to earn extra revenue by making people to wait for their table and drink and drink.  UNACCEPTABLE.  Knowing this is their business model I will never return.  I'm sick and tired of being manipulated to always wait in the bar where astonishingly there is NEVER a wait time and a seat is ALWAYS available.  NICE atmosphere from what I saw - but if you want to wait in 100+ degree heat for a table (which in our case there were many to be seated at right away) or drink yourself senseless at a bar then I guess it's OK.  We left and went to CARLEY's  - which by the way is great atmosphere, great service, great food, and I have never been manipulated to wait at the bar.",

They Have chips on their menu for nachos, she could of easily subbed chips for fries (known from experience in the industry). When the burger came to the table I swear it was real beef, I asked her about it and she said no it was a black bean burger.. What a Frozen Boca Burger they heated up on the grill. Smash burger and Pita Jungle both have way better black bean burgers, they taste and look like black bean burgers. After the food was dropped off we didn't see or hear from our server for 30 mins. The manager came by and asked how everything was and then the buss boy filled our drinks and cleared the table. We waited another 10 mins before the server came over to take our payment.",

When I opened it at home, there was barely anything left.  I wonder if it accidentally got tossed and then saved... but that's only an assumption. Overall, it's a nice location for hanging out.

As I ate my dinner, I kept thinking that the fish tasted too fishy. I complained about the flavor to the waiter and to my surprise, she told me that the fish tacos contained swordfish instead of mahi-mahi. This should have been updated on the menu. Swordfish is one of the fish with the highest concentrations of mercury. Had I known this before-hand, I would not have ordered it. To me the quality of the food has definitely lowered. This will be my last time that I eat there.",

We ended up being seated at a two top in the bar area. Waiting about 15-20 mins to get our drink order. Then waited another 20 mins for our food order. We ordered the ahi salad, fish tacos, balsamic potatoes and broccoli. After waiting another 20 mins for food the potatoes arrived raw with balsamic glazed drizzled on them. Then I tried the broccoli which was ice cold. Inside the stems were frozen still. I notified an employee and he took them back to the kitchen. They came back the same way they left, raw and cold. I've tried their Mac and cheese and wasn't impressed as it tasted like velvetta and not a mornay sauce. Honestly, I felt bad for the bartender as he was over worked on what the restaurant owners should have known was going to be a busy night. Stick to the drinks and skip the uninspiring menu.",

However it was a bad experience overall as my friend is visually impaired and the hostess told us that we couldn't sit inside because she had a dog, even after we explained that it was a service dog for the blind. We told her she was wrong so she deliberately sat us in a corner table that was next to the back door with flies coming in and swarming around us. It was obvious she wanted to seat us as close to the outside as possible.   The girl was young so she prob just didn't get it and wasn't educated on this matter, but when we brought it to the managers attention she was apologetic but said there prob weren't any booths available. I felt like she could have done more. My friend handles her disability very well and never expect better treatment than anyone else. She just expects to be treated the same, as she should since it's the law. The entire situation sort of ruined what could have been a nice dining experience.  As for the food: we both got eggs Benedict for brunch. The presentation was nice and it tasted fresh but was lacking in flavor.",

The service is very good and there is a wide array of drinks from the bar. The only thing that was a little subpar was the quality of the food.

I'll be honest, I've not explored much beyond the pozole on the menu because economically it's hard to justify. This massive bowl of pozole is such a cost-effective deal, full of broth, pork, veggies and goodness, it seems like a waste of money to spend even the same amount on a sandwich, let alone more. I'm sure they're fine, but you get my point.  The fries are okay. Just okay.   A foodie's tour of Phoenix wouldn't be complete without a bowl of the pozole, and neither would an architect's. The Vig Fillmore is housed in a historic building in downtown Phoenix with a massive patio that actually economizes on its space with room for both seating and play. Speaking of play, there are trivial pursuit cards at all the tables, which can be nice on a busy morning when the service staff is taking a while (This is not a complaint. The place just get's busy because, you know, it's got good food.)  The wine menu here is VERY good, with a selection that rivals some of Phoenix's actual wine bars while also trafficking in better food and lower prices. Their specialty cocktails are also inventive and tasty and the beer selection robust.  tl;dr This place doesn't advertise itself as the place to be, but it really kind of is. It's got a great vibe for hanging out and plenty of reasons to stay a while.",

We were not there during Happy Hour, but I have heard they have a good one. The outdoor patio seating is where the party is at. They have cornhole, a full bar, and just a awesome environment outside. I ordered the The Vig Dip and it was jam-packed with lots of meat and it was delicious. Also, we ordered the chips and salsa which were great, but one of the biggest stars of the show was the wings. They are baked, fried, grilled, and dripping with buffalo sauce. Sooooo Good!

They made eye contact and looked away, instead of letting me know it would be just a minute or handing me a glass of water while I waited.

The patio was tempting but it was just too hot to sit outside. I ordered the hot chick sandwich with onion rings ($12) and my friend ordered the best turkey sandwich with fries ($13).  They had a cute pepper tin full of trivia cards sitting on the table that you could play while you waited for your food, but we didn't have to play for very long. Our meals came out quickly and everything tasted great. The hot chick had just the right amount of spice in it. I also really enjoyed my friends turkey sandwich, but the coleslaw and dijonnaise made it a bit too rich for anything I would order for myself. The onion rings were also good but I'll definitely be ordering the french fries next time. They were super thin and crispy.    Overall I'm glad I checked this place out, I will be returning to try the Monday Burger Special ($5 for the Haverhood Burger from 6-10pm, normally $11)",

    "text": "Before I moved into the neighborhood I would swear up and down about this place. The food is good and consistent, the staff friendly, and atmosphere lively. My favorite menu items being the calamari, the ono, and steak and sprouts. Now that I frequent it more often, since I live nearby, there are a few flaws (mainly service oriented) that jump out at me. I have repeatedly shown up at the host stand for no one to greet me. Once I sat myself since no one was at the stand. I then waited an additional 10 min as people walked passed me, I gave up and sat at the bar. Today (and other days) I called several times spanning over a few hours to try to put in an order for pickup... No one answered. I gave in and walked over, I went straight to the bar and the bartender, well... She wasn't very approachable. I was going to get a cocktail as I waited but she didn't give me a chance to order it. Oh well. Btw the pozole I ordered (first time having it), the flavor is on point, but it is wayyyy too salty. I will continue to go back because the menu is so convenient and it's nearby.",

Bad planning and execution. Food was decent, drinks good too. We would have stayed for more but our requests were ignored.

Ordered the breakfast enchiladas and sent them back for being cold. They did give us a free mimosa for the enchiladas which was awesome.

    "text": "Brought my sister and her fiance here for dinner on a Sunday night.  We got here just as the NFL watchers were heading home so alot of space was opening up.  Nice adaptive reuse of this property.  With the weather finally cooling down outside we decided to grab one of the picnic tables near the entrance.  Its shaded pretty well and you get a nice view of the whole courtyard area.  Like all Vigs there's a lawnball court out back.  There's also a nice outdoor bar right in the middle of the courtyard with TVs facing all four directions.  I didn't go inside to the lounge area, but it looked pretty cool from where we were.  The food is pretty standard Vig fare.  Some surprises, but mostly reliable Vig standbys.  For an appetizer we split the soy garlic edamame dish.  My sister and her fiance are health nuts so this played right into their wheelhouse.  For the main dish I got the Hot Chick which is basically a chicken sandwich with pesto and mozzerella.  Good, clean, flavor and got fries on the side.  My sister got the same thing and her fiance got a chicken salad.  The service we got was pretty adequate, though our server got a little disorganized with our orders.  They're fairly new so I know they're still working out the kinks.    Overall, the menu won't wow you.  But what they do have, they do right.  The atmosphere is really cool and will make for a great nighttime hangout now with the weather improving.  And if you're just coming for drinks after a dinner next door at Cibo, this place will do the trick.  Add yet another great addition to downtown's exploding culinary scene.",

She immediately recognized us, remembered our drink order, and told us she would comp our appetizer because of our bad experience. (We had said nothing, so the fact that she recognized us from the first time was surprising). Her service this time was great. Drinks were full, waters were refilled, food and plates came out in perfect timing and she was very sweet. Glad we came back and hopefully service will continue to get better because the pasole is amazing!",

This to me is an ideal date spot for both new couples and ones like myself who have been married over a decade.  The apps are great and they have an excellent array of craft brews and a intelligent bar tending staff that makes great drinks. The pad Thai is legit awesome and one of my favorite things on the menu. The burgers are good and usually part of a happy hour deal. We also tried the Mac with bacon and it was done right. Even if it's packed they still get food out to you fairly quickly. The price point is fair and the restaurant and restrooms are always clean. The staff is always friendly as well. I would definitely recommend The Vig to my friends and fellow helpers. I hope you add this place to your list :)",

    "text": "If you haven't heard of The Vig, you've probably been living under a rock. On Mars. The Vig is a fashionable fixture with high-end pub fare, with a brunch menu, music, outdoor seating & bocce court. Yes, you read that right, a bocce court! Okay, okay, but this is about the pub fare. And the most famous of their fares is the Mac-n-Cheese.  The Vig uses a Campanella noodle, allowing their signature flavors of american cheese, white cheddar, and gruyere cheeses to fuse nicely to the noodle. The flavor is a burst of buttery cheese followed by salty notes. Personally, it's a bit too salty for my pallet, but adding some crushed black pepper brings balance (for me).  Looking for something a bit lighter? Try their Sweet Potato Fries. Mmmmm. These paired excellent with an ice cold Four Peaks Peach Ale to nicely wash down the saltiness.   Looking for a drink? I'd recommend The Vigroni (Bombay Sapphire Gin, Aperol, Cocchi Americano, Hibiscus Simple Syrup and Fresh Lemon Juice). The taste of fresh lemon juice lingers softly on the tongue.   Overall, The Vig is a great spot to start your evening with light pub fares, signature cocktails, tasteful environmental design, and local craft brews. Priced fairly for the style of fare and ambiance you experience. But don't stay too long, as Phoenix has plenty to offer for dinner ;)",

The staff is always kind and efficient, and the food is always yummy!  The interior of this place looks great. The bar has a nice white, marble. The barstools kinda hurt your butt after awhile though... There are also a lot of indoor tables and booths, all of which are super comfy. Another thing I love about the interior is the exposed brick! This place is so cute, especially at night. Although, I should mention that some of the booths inside are poorly lit. I sat at a booth near the back once and had to squint the whole time as the overhead light was extremely dim and unadjustable.  If you're coming at night, I highly recommend sitting outside! They've got a ton of fairy lights and it's really pretty (and could be romantic!) if it's cool out, they've also got HUGE space heaters.  The only minor downside to this location is the parking. This isn't a problem if you come early, but if you tend to be late (cough cough, my friend Ahmed!) then you might be driving around in circles until you find a spot. There's a SMALL private lot you can valet. I believe the lot is shared with the neighbor restaurant Cibo. There's also lots of street parking available.  I'm a huge fan of the trifecta, calamari, classic burger, chicken wings and guac and chips. They've also got a HUGE drink menu!!  Definitely a great place for a first date (and second and third) and definitely a great place to catch up with an old friend. Highly recommend!",

They took responsibility and apologized for each point that I had mentioned and shared specific steps they have taken to prevent something similar happening. He said they have moved the 'add chicken' button to a separate place from the 'side of chicken' button. They reviewed my pictures with their team of cooks and were looking at the dressing that they make for this salad.   He also offered to treat me for a second visit to give them a chance to redeem themselves. I didn't feel comfortable accepting the free meal, because that is not why I yelp, but I will however, go back sometime and give them a second chance and I will update my review again at that time. Everyone has bad days, but how you respond to failure says a lot. If I were giving stars for the response, it would be 5 stars and with that kind of leadership, I have no doubt that they will do well.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner a few weeks ago after a concert a few blocks away.   I was impressed with the design and layout of the restaurant. The hostess working this evening was also very charming and was very welcoming when we walked up.  I can't remember her name, but she was really cute and had a personality to match her knee high sequined/glitter boots. There is a lovely outside bar area that is quite large.   We were initially seated outside at our request, but it got a little chilly for us so we asked if we could move inside.  The same cute little hostess was so accommodating and helped move our drinks and appetizers to an inside table.   Once we sat at that table, another table opened up inside the bar area, so we once again asked the cute hostess if we could move to the table in the bar as it was late and that seemed to be where most of the action was at this time of night.   The hostess kindly arranged for us to move to the table next to the bar.  That was really nice of her as I know it is such a hassle when customers do that, but she was very accommodating and helpful.   The food and drinks were wonderful.  The pazole was awesome as was the steak and Brussels sprouts. The bread pudding dessert was so very good. We also ordered blueberry martinis (I think that's what it was). They were fabulous! We must have ordered five or six of them they were so good.   We stayed until they made last call. They never made us feel rushed or acted like they wanted us to leave.  This is a great location nestled right in the city.   They have Great food, a cozy ambience, attentive staff and the cutest little hostess!",

I had a bartender approach me once and I asked for one more minute to look at the drink menu. I put down the menu and made eye contact with three bartenders and they did not stop to take my order. There was only one other person at the bar. My friends came and I left the bar with no drink due to being ignored. They also removed my friend's party reservation, which she confirmed that morning. Our waitress served us the wrong drinks and decided to take a break. We waited 20 minutes and had to ask another employee to find her to fix our drink order. The service was horrible! I liked the outside patio and I'm giving it two stars for the food, which was very good.",

Ambiance: This place has outdoor and indoor seating, with an outdoor bar and TVs for those who are interested in some outdoor seating on a warmer night. I definitely think this place is more romantic at night, with all the string lights around the restaurant.   Food: I saw the pictures on Yelp and I couldn't resist ordering the Mac & Cheese with Short Ribs added. It was not a mistake! The short ribs were very tender and juicy, it went perfectly with the mac & cheese. I asked for it baked, which made the mac on top a bit crispier. It was awesome! We also got the steak and fries, which I thought wasn't as good as the short ribs mac & cheese. One of the friends in the group couldn't eat beef but wanted the bleu cheese burger, and was able to substitute the beef patty for a crispy chicken with no extra charge!  I was also able to bring in a cake to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday without having some absurd cake cutting fee, which I really appreciated.    Loved the food and ambiance here at the Vig Fillmore, and would definitely be coming back for another celebration!",

My boyfriend and I chose to self seat ourselves at the outdoor patio bar, which had ample seating. We started with a few beers and the chicken wings. The wings (traditional) were excellent! The food came out very quickly and piping hot with both the sauces we requested.  We then decided to split a Black and Bleu burger as our main course served with our choice of sweet potato fries. Not only did the bar back (Chris) that took our order describe the difference between regular fries and the sweet potato, but he also asked if we wanted ketchup in addition to the aioli that traditionally is served. Such a great way to anticipate the guest's needs!! The burger was served (already split for us- we didn't even ask) and it was cooked perfectly Medium as we specified when asked by Chris!  Our second round of beers was served promptly and with friendly service. Jenna, the bartender was excellent and followed up with us throughout the meal & experience.   What a phenomenal experience. Thank you Chris and Jenna- we'll be back looking for you both!!!!",

    "text": "Short summary:  - TRASH service  - Over 50 minute wait time for food (table of 4) - Condescending manager named \"Michelle\"  The real Review:  For reference I frequented the North Scottsdale location numerous times but recently moved to the downtown Phoenix area. We were relieved to find a restaurant that we could rely on for the food and service. The Mac and Cheese is my favorite! This location has trash service, the management is less than adequate. We ordered a burger with Mac n Cheese (an up charge of 3 dollars for a side, which is fine but a very important detail) and my friends ordered Mac and Cheese. Our food took over 50 minutes to come out, it came out as soon as we voiced our concern. The food looked like it had been on the heating tray in the kitchen for over 10 minutes. The Mac and Cheese was dry(dehydrated) on the top and the burger itself was also dry. I didn't touch the Mac and Cheese. When the manager came over to talk to us she said \"Well we got a new heating lamp in the kitchen\". She offered to remake our side but we declined because at this point it had been so long and we wanted to eat. She gave us fries as a side instead and said \"no worries I comped the Mac n cheese AND the fries\". THE FRIES ARE A FREE SIDE WITH THE BURGER, like wow I am flabbergasted by how kind she was (totally being sarcastic). The entire time the manager had a condescending tone and was not being receptive to our table's concerns. Not once did we receive and apology or felt like there was an intent to make things right by both the waitress or the manager named \"Michelle\". I worked in the restaurant industry for 7 years and I can say this location is a big disappointment. Yes, I had time today to write a review because you don't treat customers like that.   CHERRY TO THE TOP: The waitress messed up on charging our cards.",

    "text": "This place has bad service and poor communication. I have worked for years as a waitress and was appalled by the service here.  I went last night on a Friday to this Vig location. I was very disappointed. When I arrived, I was told there would be a 15-20 minute wait and that I could sit in the patio area while waiting. I sat in the patio area for 20 minutes thinking I would be offered drinks or appetizers; various staff members saw me and my friends sitting but did nothing to tell us we needed to walk up to the bar to ask for drinks and appetizers. We finally walked up to the bar and ordered a few drinks and food. Not only did the bartender get our drink order wrong, he also informed me he had seen our group waiting and that we should have come up to the bar sooner.  After 30 minutes passed, I walked back up to the host stand and asked about our table. I was rudely told by the hostesses that I was next in line for a table and that I shouldn't have ordered real food at the bar because they try and discourage this. When we finally got a table, well after the quoted wait time, our server was clearly annoyed we had already ordered food and sent a new server over to deal with us.   On top of the bad service and poor communication, I ordered the Avocado Cobb salad and guess what was missing from the salad? The avocado. At that point, I didn't even have enough energy to complain.  All in all, it was a lousy experience that could have been improved by the staff simply caring enough to communicate with us what to do while waiting. I would not recommend going here.",

I was kinda disappointed they weren't as good as I remembered, and they also had black olives, which the menu didn't state. I detest black olives, but I wasn't gonna complain. Some people do have food allergies, so it is important to list all the ingredients on the menu. I worked in a restaurant so I pay attention to things like that.  It looked like they had a decent happy hour and some good brunch items. I would return if given the opportunity and try something else.",

It may be more of a libations establishment. Also, I came 1 hr before dinner service is over. We tried to make the ordering basic so as to not cause kitchen issues.  2 basic burgers, one order of macaroni and cheese and a charcuterie board consisting of about 40% grapes, a rolled up ball of prosciutto that we couldn't separate and a few slices of salami with 4 small pieces of crusted bread, one for each person. Total $80. No drinks! Actually, now that I write this I'm getting more and more pissed that I even gave it 3 stars. So, I'll stop here.",

The hostess informed us that they were finishing up and we could sit wherever.  I asked what time they stopped serving and she said midnight.  It seemed this was not for another 3 hours.....odd.  But she gave us the menus and told us to seat ourselves.  Thanks for that helpful interaction.  We ordered the ahi tuna salad.  The tuna was average and a little overdone.  The dressing was way too spicy.  It overpowered everything and made it difficult to taste the veggies.  Would have been nice if they add some cranberries or something sweet.  Also had the broccoli appetizer which was OK.  The brussels sprouts were Ok.  Neither was outstanding.    This one gets the big MEH.",

We were at a makeshift table overlooking a window that was tucked away from the normal traffic, so we ended up going to bar to get our drinks refills. Maybe that's the norm here, I'm not sure. When our food came out we did not have silverware, again maybe the casual atmosphere is set up so you need to request it (to multiple people). Our server was very nice, she appeared to be rushing so maybe they were short servers. As for the food, it was ok. My macaroni and cheese was dried out, as if it was forgotten in the oven. Since it was my first time, I will give it another try, but not on a Friday night.",

While it was a 5 min uber ride from the convention center and all the restaurants in that area it was so worth it!  It was so awesome, I went there for lunch and dinner, bringing my team to the wonderful outdoor respite of the restaurant. The patio is perfect for a relaxing afternoon, with water misters to keep you cool from the Phoenix heat. The appetizers are all great, including the guacamole and Thai-flavored wings. They offer a nice selection of entrees, including meat, seafood and healthy options. In addition, the cocktails are perfect for the time of day, be it a Moscow mule, mimosa or wine/beer.   This is going on my must visit list every time we go to Phoenix so definitely add this to your list!",

    "text": "Six of us came to this Vig's location for happy hour, and it turned out to be a decent lounge for group gatherings. The premise was aesthetically pleasing. From the inside out, the three dining areas started from the indoor bar, an enclosed dining space, and then the spacious outdoor patio. People can come for happy hour from 3-6pm, Monday through Friday. TVs were available by the bars, as well as lives music performances later in the evening. The loungy atmosphere was relaxing, casual, and fun.   The Guac & Chips ($5) came with a basket of warm chips that came with refills, fresh guacamole, and pico de gallo. The consistency of the guacamole was thick, creamy, with solid textures. It could use some chopped jalapeno, but otherwise it was a good value item.  The eight-piece Hot Wings ($6) were grilled to perfection, with a firm meaty bite and sweet BBQ flavors that soon kicked in. The blue cheese dip was unnecessary, especially when the wings were not spicy at all. It was another good item to share.   The Fish Tacos ($6.5) came with double deck tortillas that were layered with blacken white fish, spicy slaw, pico de gallo, and tomatillo-avocado salsa. The fish was meaty, blackened with good flavor, but the spicy elements were again missing. The tomatillo-avocado salsa was a good addition, but the flavors could use a lift with a spicy citrus kick. Again, like other dishes, the food was good to share, but the flavors were kept too safe without any sort of risk-taking.   The Hummus ($8) turned out to be the most disappointing dish on the evening. It came with roasted garlic and siracha hummus that failed to distinguish from one to the other. The small, triangular pitas were served warm, but they were also stiff to the point it was crunchy. Epic fail, this was not a dish I would get again.  Overall, like many lounges, food was second nature when you have a wide array of drinks and great company. Service unfortunately was a hit or miss. However, the low-risk prices, along with the decor and ambiance culminated an enjoyable evening. Based on other reviews, I suggest for people to grab dinner elsewhere before coming here for a nightcap. Great for groups, I would return when I have out of town guests or special gatherings.",

I had never been to this restaurant before and was told everything on the menu was good. There were several of us and we all shared our dishes. I was underwhelmed to say the least. I could've gotten over the mediocre food had it not been for the worst service and waitress I've had in probably over a decade. They took forever to bring out our food, at least twice forgot things we ordered altogether and one order was completely wrong. Then after being told on the phone that they didn't offer anything for birthdays we later found out they give a complementary slice of cake and an ice cream scoop. Later when the bill came they charged us for the dessert and we had to have the waitress correct the nearly $200 bill. People I tell you I could've gotten over all these blunders and mediocre food had it been for this waitress's horrible horrible attitude. It was clear she could've cared less about either us, her job or both. Whatever her problem was she should not have been serving tables that night. Highly disappointed this experience happened on my friend's birthday.",

Our server was SO nice about my list and went and consulted with the chef about the ingredients of some of the salad dressings then suggested two that would pair well with the salad I wanted.

    "text": "My roommate and I went here for our weekly Friday night out dinner. We both loved this place!! We asked to sit outside because we saw how lively and nicely decorated it was. BEST DECISION! If the weather is nice and you're comfortable with sitting outside, do it!! The area is adorable, its decorated with such cute string lights going across the area as well as being in the trees. There's also an outdoor bar with TVs, which is awesome! As far as the food goes, I ordered the Poke Bowl with a side of watermelon. The watermelon wasn't something on the menu, but the server was more than happy to serve it. My roommate ordered the wings (half thai and half traditional) and she said they were great! I was already pretty stoked to be there just because of how cool the outside area was and the food honestly made it even better. If you're in the area or want to try something new, come check this place out!!!",

Their late night menu consists of all of their best dishes: nachos, the trifecta (sliders, FAVE), posole, chips & guac, big bowl (fries or onion rings, or mix!), street tacos and more. The thing we cannot go there without ordering: the VINGS (Vig's hot wings). Please do yourself a favor and order these. The back entrance that goes straight to the patio of ample tables, bar, fire place, and corn hole is a very inviting and chill atmosphere. Don't forget to use the trivia cards and play with whoever you're with and ditch your phone! Staff is awesome and service is always great. Love the Vig.",

I can be sitting at the bar solo or with someone and the staff really treat you well. Making conversation on anything under the sun. Which is what one would like when sitting at the bar. If I'm at a table, leave me alone.   They have a really decent selection of craft beers on tap. I would love to have a way to know what's on rotation. In particular of all locations I love the outdoor bar here. This place used to be the local breeze and sitting out at the bar at the vig here brings back fond memories of hangover recovery Bloody Mary brunches.  The Vig Filmore is also going to be my pre Crescent Ballroom stop from here on out.   I'm a fan!",

And they surrounded the area with heaters, so even though it was a cold and drizzly day, everyone felt pretty comfortable.  The Novem-beer event itself was fun, a good value for what you paid because you got to sample a lot of drinks.  Plus, they were supposed to punch your card every time you got a sample, but lots of times they didn't punch my card, so if I had wanted to, I could've gotten way more than ten samples (but I didn't.... I'm a light weight).  The service got slower when it got really packed, but we were fine with waiting since we were there to hang out and chat anyway.  Like the other Vig location, their food doesn't super impress me, but it's good enough to come back again.",

Parking however is difficult. The outside space with the yard is nice and huge with corn hole games.   You're greeted as soon as you arrive. I would recommend making a reservation for larger parties & ask to have the checks split before hand. It took an hour to get out bill figured out on my birthday night. I have also gone with a small groups.   The best item on the menu is \"The Best Turkey Sandwich\"! Its Thanksgiving in your mouth! The Mac'N'Chz with the add-ins and fish tacos were amazing as well. My son loves the kids menu! So good for kids. The cocktails are delicious & refreshing. I personally like sitting at the bar to see the drinks being made.  Best Sunday Funday spot with bottomless mimosas and a live DJ outside. It gets busy so get there early for a table.   A+ spot! Good food! Good staff! Great area! I'll be coming back often.",

So it's hard to notice this spot because as of yet, there is no signage. It's in a house.  I drove the street twice til I realized the house WAS The Vig. The indoors is the restaurant portion and the side of the house is the patio area.  There are grassy areas, which is a nice touch and they have a central bar with seating all around, tables and chairs throughout the courtyard, and a fireplace with Adirondack chairs/tables as well.  The tall fence blocks out the traffic and construction going on nearby.  The menu is slightly different than 'my' Vig, but is primarily very similar. The bar waitstaff was initially a little slow, although it did pick up and they were all very cordial and helpful.    I'll come back next time I'm downtown as I think if y ou're a downtown dweller this could turn out to be as great as the other Vigs.",

Tonight, a small mishap with our dinner after 100 percent perfect meals every other time, and without missing a beat - the staff dealt with the issue with the same class they've exhibited at our celebration dinners, our lazy Tuesday dinners, and our \"hey, how about The Vig\" dinners. Here's to you Vig - and each and every one of you that makes your outdoor feel like our backyard.",

There was a wait seeing that it was Sunday brunch, which is very popular here, so we decided to eat at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and we ordered the horchata drink. Totally butchered that! It was delicious. Our food did take a little longer than normal so the manager took off an appetizer without us saying a word. Food is amazing, service is phenomenal, will always recommended and come back!",

Also one of the employees asked a table if they could sample a reserve bottle of wine that they bought because he didn't even know they had that one & had never tried it before. Not only was he on the job trying wine at the table with the guest, he took the FIRST POUR. Wow. I don't know if he was the manager or owner but still that isn't right to me & especially in front of other customers as well. Totally unprofessional, are you able to go up to your tables & ask them for a sample of their wine whether it's reserve or not? Really odd to me. Also the appetizers were only a few dollars cheaper than our entrees, it was just a little overpriced.",

He was one of the better servers I've had. We'll be back, and I think it's safe to say we found a new spot to be \"regulars\" at.",

The food is consistently amazing. The deconstructed fish tacos are out of this world-- fresh Mahi Mahi - and only $14. The pork nachos are simply heaven!  The hummus platter is awesome! And the wings are great!!!  And the happy hour food is some of the best selection and prices out there! Plus you can't beat $4 Titos through September!  To top it off, the service is OUTSTANDING!!!!

I just discovered this place a few weeks ago and it has been my go to after a long day at work or a relaxing Saturday. The set up is really nice, to turn a house into a full functioning bar and restaurant is pretty awesome. Different from what I'm used to with Old Town bars and restaurants, a good different.

    "text": "I gave this place a second chance because I live a block and a half away. The first time around, the food was pretty forgettable, especially the happy hour hummus which was runny and flavorless.  The second time, I went for brunch with my boyfriend and the wait time was 45 minutes (!) The vibe is young, wealthy white urban douchebags and wannabes. They have absolutely awful music blasting throughout the place-- so bad I would have preferred muzak or silence.  The music is so loud that patrons have to talk over it, so as a result, the whole place is loud which is strange for brunch. The overpriced eggs benedict were greasy and smothered in some bad (again flavorless) chipotle aioli.  The waiter had a very strange affect-- we flagged him down and asked him for the check to which his odd reply was to stop dead in his tracks, look at us and ask in a mocking loud smarmy voice, \"would you like me to bring you the check?\" as if we rudely interrupted him. Yep, that's what we asked. You're not on stage here, dude. Can you do your job without the weird bitchy theatrics?   The one star is for the drinks only.  I'm absolutely shocked that anybody would wait 1-2 hours to eat here. Also, the locale is off-- this place would be right at home in Scottsdale. Sad to see my neighborhood go The Way of the Douche, and it's just getting worse.",

The first time my waiter was a complete hipster douchebag who made me feel like an idiot because I didn't know what bottomless mimosas were, innocently I've never heard that term so I did what any inquisitive person would do and asked. Was he nice about it? No! He teased me the whole time and posted it on Facebook where his loser hipster buddies can laugh at me. Second was when I was summoned to a business meeting with a new client. The dinner was nice and the service was better this time, however, at the end of my meal as I'm ready to pay I notice a chewed up piece of bubblegum on top of my plate. I asked everyone at the table and seriously doubt a new client of mine would dare place their chewed up gum on my plate. The manager spoke to us and very apologetic and as I was leaving he handed me a gift card for $10. I guess I'm not hipster and loser enough to dine at The Vig in downtown.",

Came here with a group of 8, at prime dinner time, and was quoted a half hour to 45 minute wait.  Not a big deal for us since we weren't in any hurry.  However, we were pleasantly surprised when seated only after 20 minutes.  Our server was attentive and very nice.  He even split up our checks and let all of us use our Localdines coupons we had!!  Thank you!!  I got the black bean burger and it was amazing!!  Tons of flavor and our server suggested I get the mixed fries of sweet potato and original and that was a great suggestion!!!  A little bit of everything!  We sat inside at a part that looked like a sun room.  It was extremely clean and classy and felt really comfortable with our big group.  The outside looked really nice too but we didn't have a chance to experience that.  Valet parking is complementary in the back between The Vig and CIBO.  Which is a total PLUS!  Parking is so hard to find downtown.  We will definitely come here again!!",
