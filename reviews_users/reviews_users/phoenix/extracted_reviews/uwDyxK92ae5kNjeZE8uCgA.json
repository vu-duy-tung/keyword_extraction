    "text": "This one was hard for me to rate.  Usually, I throw a 5 star rating whenever I hear the name \"California Pizza Kitchen\", but last night made me dock that rating.  It has been a few months since I last enjoyed a meal at the ol' CPK.  This is easily my favorite pizza joint in the valley.  They have a wide selection of pizzas to fit every palate.  If you're not in the mood for pizza, don't fret!  They have plenty of Pastas, Salads, Sandwiches, and more to make everybody happy.  Another real treat for me is their cocktail menu.  They serve some very fresh drinks that are a step above the norm.  Last night, I had their Plum Martini, which was delicious.  I could not even taste the alcohol... It literally tasted like I was drinking directly from a plum.  Delicious!  My meal of choice is their Barbecue Chicken Pizza.  It used to be just another pizza on the menu, but right now, they seem to really be focusing on that one, so it does not feel as special.  If you are looking at their menu, they Bold it, highlight it in red, add a remark about it being \"Their Classic Pizza\", and so on and so forth... Let's not go over the top, guys.  It's a great pizza, but give the right amount of credit, and don't blow it out of proportion.  The desserts here are also fantastic.  Yesterday, I sampled their Strawberry Shortcake, which is a plate of fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and a piping hot biscuit served on a cool plate.  Exquisite.  After reading all this, you may be asking yourself:  Why is the rating only Three Stars?  Here's why.  This place is expensive.  All of their food items are marked up at least 25% higher than what it should be.  The Barbecue Chicken Pizza would be great if it were, say, $10.  Here, it's $13.  The Plum Martini?  $8.50.  The Strawberry Shortcake?  $7.00.  This meal ran me $30, and that's without the tip.  I do not agree that the prices should be so high.    The food?  Fantastic.  The price?  It's way too high.  Overall Score?  3 stars.",

Once i placed the order i asked them if they could bring out some bread, oil and butter.  They said they were out of bread.  Its a pizza place,  how do you run out of bread?  Anyways,  they did did bring out  few pieces out. Unfortunately not enough for the whole table.  Then the manager brings out some chips and guacamole on a dish because they didn't have the bread.  There were literally 9 chips on the plate.  I joked with the manager that we would all get one chip,  and she just walked away.    Finally when we got the pizzas,  they were all cold.  We had a hard time chewing on the dough because it was so cold.  I don't think this location is able to handle groups.  Maybe a few people at a time would be ok.  The funny thing is we went late and the place was pretty empty.  They were not busy at all.  I wont be coming to this CPK again. Ill try spinatos next time",

This time we were seated near the computers where orders are entered.  We spent most of our meal listening to chit chat about the fact that one of servers was married.  This went on for almost the entire meal, and since we were in for a late lunch there wasn't a lot of other tables around so I can't imagine that they didn't notice that we were there.  If you want to chat how about not seating one of the few tables right there.  Also we had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, that's not a huge issue except for the fact that 3 servers walked by each saying that the hostess was around somewhere.",

Even worse, when it makes you swell up to the size of Shamu - or at least makes you feel that way.   If I have to eat here again, I'm going with something simple, like a salad.  6/10/08 UPDATE: I did go back for lunch. I had a 10% off \"surprise\" coupon, so what the hell? My friend and I split the chicken rosemary sandwich, which came with a choice of soup, salad or slaw. Too bad they didn't have fresh fruit as an option!  It was very tasty, especially since we asked for goat cheese. We opted to get the mustard on the side, though it turned out to be very tasty. Not a bad choice for lunch for $6. The service was better this time, too.",

It's kind of expensive for what you get, average food and ehh service. I ordered online and selected a time for pick up. I got there 5-10 min after the pickup time and waited around for someone to ring up my food. I'm like \"I'll be outside with my dog so come out and get me\" The manager comes out and is like.. oh Im sorry we just put your order in the oven, here are some coupons for free apetizers. But I have to order $15 worth before I get the free appetizer.   Anyways, I went there because I had a giftcard but from now on I think I'll ask for Subway giftcards instead.",

While the restaurant is one of my favorites, the new location didn't quite blow me away during a lunch time visit with some coworkers this afternoon. Our server looked like he was 10 and took forever to bring our drinks. My peach lemonade (CPK is known for their mouthwatering flavored lemonades) had just a dash of peach syrup so you could barely taste the peach. And there was something off about the mac 'n' cheese, which I usually love. The cheese seemed to be extra runny today. While this dish, which isn't on the menu, is one of my favorites, it didn't delight at the new CPK. The highlight? The tasty key lime pie. Yum!!!   I imagine the restaurant will get better in time. It's the first week it's opened so I'm taking this into account and will return again in a few weeks to see if it's up to par.",

The pizza was just okay ... I wasn't blown away ... I've been to this cpk twice once at dinner and once at lunch and it's never busy so you would think it's a good place for a quick meal but be warned people take there time in this place.

We would've waited but the hostess gave us an estimated wait time of 20 minutes and the place wasn't even at full capacity... Excuse me? Eventually, they turned on the heat lamps. We split the Works Pizza and an order of some sort of Bacon Avacado Egg Rolls; both were just average with no pop or bang. Even the sauces that were served with the egg rolls fell flat. There were leftovers and I'm usually a pizza garbage can so that alone says something. Will I come back, yes... but not on my dime!",

    "text": "Originally the plan was to have dinner at Maria Maria with the family. The wait for a table on a Saturday evening was too long, besides my three year old was starving and demanded mac & cheese, so we decided to move on.  Strolling through Tempe Marketplace we found ourselves in front of California Pizza Kitchen, looking through the glass of the door we could see that there was no wait, and that is exactly what we needed. Walking in the door we promptly got greeted by a very friendly hostess and we got seated immediately  with  crayons ready for my little one.  Here is what we ordered:  Thai Crunch Salad, Carne Asada Pizza and Curly Mac n' Cheese.   Generally I am not a fan of big franchise concepts but I have to say that the quality of the food was excellent considering it comes out of  a \"system kitchen\".   At first I was not so sure about Carne Asada on a Pizza but it was surprisingly good. National favorites of two soccer-crazy countries, that had to go together. The Thai Crunch Salad was quite good as well and probably for the first time I noticed that all the ingredients mentioned on a menu item were actually in the dish. But perhaps that is just the way CPK designs an writes their menu.  My little boy also approved the mac and cheese.  On a side note we ordered one Maragrita (Cuervo gold tequila, not blended) and it was done well, but then how hard is it to screw up a Margarita?  Over all we were very satisfied with our dinner at CKP, we got to sit down on a Saturday evening without waiting, the food came out quickly and the young waiter was very friendly.   If I could rate this California Pizza Kitchen with 3.5 stars then I really would. The only thing I was not so fond of is that the check arrived at the table too quickly. I can appreciate the intention of speedy service, and that is good,  but please let me finish my dinner before you bring the check....or am I too old fashioned?",

I have had a bunch of their pizzas and salads and they are all are pretty much the same no matter which location you go.  I am not a super huge fan of putting non-typical toppings on pizza, but I guess that is what CPK is there for.  I do like the crust though..  I am a fan of a few of their salads because I am trying to be a bit healthier but after reviewing the nutritional information of most of their salads I realize I am doing more harm than good.  Last night I had the CPK Cobb and it was just ok.  Another salad I enjoy is the BBQ chicken one.  The service is always very good and quick most of the time if they are not too busy.  If you are in the area and want a decent salad and/or \"California\" style pizza, then CPK is a good bet.",

The wait is never long, except one time we 'made' a reservation for 8 even though they don't take reservation, they wrote us down and made sure we got a table quicker when we came back [:  The food is is always delicious. I know people love their pizzas, but I always get the salad too. The roasted vegetable salad is amazing [: We always come in big groups so each of us we get a different pizza to share. So far none have disappointed us. I mean how can you go wrong. Just pick whatever pizza you are craving for and expect it to come out delicious.  The only thing I would not recommend is the pasta, and I guess its our fault cause why go to a pizza place and order pasta.",

    "text": "Four things to know about California Pizza Kitchen:  1.  The food is delicious.  I used to call this place \"California Pizza Sh*ttin\" around the year 1999 when I tried the food back then.  I didn't like the taste 14 years ago, but I think their grub is pretty awesome now.  Tasty margherita pizza.  My wife, who had never been to a CPK before, was also very impressed not only with her pizza but also her salad.  My daughter really enjoyed her pasta.  2.  The service is fantastic.  Our waitress was very friendly, helpful, and present--and that's exactly what we needed along with great food at the end of a stressful day.  3.  It ain't cheap.  You don't go here for a bargain.  It won't break your bank, but this is upscale pizza, and a deluxe meal for your family of three could approach $70.  4.  It's LOUD.  Between the music, and people shouting to be heard over the music, this place is updecible and well as upscale.  It's like a warzone soundwise.  Be warned.  Great dinner.  The coupon and gift card we had helped a lot with the bill.  Yes, definitely recommended.",

    "text": "I was checking in here and noticed the low rating they seemed to be getting and said to my husband 3 stars are they joking?  Have they tasted this food?  They cant be serious I mean have you had the BBQ chicken salad?  Have you tried the habenero pizza?    Those two items just keep us coming back but heres where things start to change and stars start to disappear.  Since Summer hit we can no longer sit outside and enjoy the patio its just too hot so we are forced inside.  The music is so incredibly loud and not just on one visit but the last 5 or 6 visits for that awesome salad we almost wanted to shoot ourselves in the head.    You couldnt have a decent conversation.  We couldnt hear each other.  We asked them to turn it down they did slightly then asked if it was ok and I said honestly no its still not ok its horrible.  They didnt turn it down any more like they should of but thankfully another song came on that wasnt as blaring.  Next few visits we noticed the music is off the charts insanely loud but we didnt want to draw more attention to ourselves we figured lets just get our salad and get the heck outta here.    The next thing that really starts to bother me is their cumbersome approach to a frequent diners card.  You sign up for the pizza dough ap and then they are supposed to load your points sometimes they load them and other times you dont get that lucky.  You have to be a pain in the butt asking about your points if they got it right etc. just not fun and tends to be embarrassing.    They have a new promo get double points til end of July or something but we never get double so they go ask management and management pushes it off on call corporate there is a number on front of pizza dough but there is only a number for them and when you call they blow you off again.    They probably would have retained that 4 star rating I initially gave if they only turn down the music and train all their employees on how pizza dough works oh and the curbside service sucks too wow do they not do a very good job of communicating.  Last two calls went horribly wrong I felt like I was on Candid Camera and these people needed me to help them do their job it was like an Abbot and Costello movie.    I call and say oh I didnt know you delivered it curbside the response is oh yes we do so I check to see if my salad is ready and she says when you pick it up and I say didnt you say you had curbside?  She says oh you want curbside?  (Its 120 degrees outside)  Yes I would like curbside.  She seemed flustered (had her on speaker) husband says screw this I will go in and pick it up.  I have called in orders twice and the communication was so bad both times we HAD to go in and pick it up rather than have them make good on their curbside service.  I guess that was maybe a very interesting way that they have come up with to get out of the 120 degree weather.  It worked!",

She was very gracious and welcoming and offered us a coupon for our next visit.  As for the food it was very good.  Great portions; I personally tend to eat a lot and one of their regular pies was just the right size for me.  I didn't leave hungry and I also wasn't over stuff.  Regarding taste, I'm not really sure if there is such a thing as California style pizza and whether or not this was it, but nevertheless, the pizza was very good.  I had the BBQ one and I would get it again.  I only wish they had a white pizza, that was kind of a letdown, but again the BBQ was very good.  We also had a slice of their key lime pie which they are famous for, which was very creamy and just the right amount of tangy.  Can't wait to try some of their other pies.",

The flatbread was probably our favorite. The salad had so much potential but you can tell the strawberries had been sitting around in liquid for awhile. They were pale and mushy. Mmmmm....and for just over $10 it was a total waste of $. We picked off the strawberries and ate a $10 romaine & feta salad with 4 balls of watermelon on it. The BBQ pizza was perfectly OK - I liked the abundance of cilantro, hubby wished it had more zip from BBQ sauce. The flatbread was killer. Crisp, chewy, savory. Oh - normally I order a club soda and receive it at no charge (it is literally just carbonated water...) but here I was charge $2+. I feel like we paid for a meal that should have been really good and received a meal that was incredibly \"meh\".",

Also, the water had something floating in it and the appetizer plates were dirty. My mom liked the way that the waiter handled the dirty plate situation.  Good point: the seasonal Sam Adams CPK has on draft right now is very tasty. Light on the palate and great for any meal.

We arrived and were seated pretty fast, it was around 12:30ish on a Saturday afternoon. Our server was Faith, and she was good at making sure our table was taken care of!  Now about 8 years ago I found my favorite pizza, the BBQ Chicken Pizza, it changed the way I thought of pizza, no longer did I think that pizza had to have a tomato base sauce, and to this day, I still love my bbq chicken pizza to be bbq sauce, cheese, chicken, red onions & cilantro, but I noticed on the menu right under the original bbq chicken, they had an Hawaiian BBQ Chicken it's just like the original, but with fresh pineapples added to it. OMG I love the combo of chicken and pineapples, so that's what I ordered, and let me tell you, it was perfectly delicious!    I also saw they had a small dish that was White Corn Guacamole, that had sweet white corn, diced avocado, black beans, jicama, bell peppers, cilantro & serrano peppers with white & blue corn tortilla chips. Omg this small dish was perfect to share and tasted so dang good, I think I am going to have to try to make it at home.  I'll try not to let 8 years slip by before I come back to CPK next time.",

I think it's average pizza. I've had worse and I've had better. That's why I'd give this place 3 stars. Average pizza. The server was great, so, I guess I'll bump this up to 5 stars instead of the three.",

I ordered the guacamole corn small plate (2 of them to be exact because they're awesome!) and my boyfriend ordered the baked potato soup. For dinner I got the kung pao spaghetti (my fave) and he got a cobb salad. The food was really good and the service was perfect. Our waiter was attentive and our food came out in a reasonable amount of time.   I recommend joining their rewards club because they send out coupons pretty regularly.",

Added the tiramisu afterward, didn't like it so much.  Tempe marketplace location is good, huge seating plus the patio seats. Staff is good and welcoming. The two issues are that the distance between the door and the reception desk is too close and the restrooms can't serve a busy day in that restaurant.",

I went in not expecting much to be honest judging from the bland decor and the fact it was very busy. It seemed like just a chain with no MAGIC. Somewhere I would fill my face with carbs and move on to the gig.  There was a 40 minute wait so I opted to be served at the bar straight away. From here on my expectations were exceeded as we had extremely fast and polite service even with the restaurant being as busy as a blue arse fly.  I got the thin, crispy crust pear and blue cheese pizza which made me giggle with absolute delight as though fairies entered the restaurant and sprinkled the inside of my mouth with delicious magic dust... magic dust which actually just tasted of good pizza. The crust was very well done and made a pleasent change from the carb heavy American deep pan.  Then it happened... the Quesadilla starter came out with a sauce that anyone who likes sriracha NEEDS to try. It's ranch... with... wait for it.... SRIRACHA! A mystical Asian/American spell was cast on my taste buds and I promise I will forever cast sriracha on to my ranch for the time I remain a wizard.  What was initially expected to be a bland and drab pizza chain experience turned in to a night of fairies, magic and sriracha in my ranch.",

    "text": "For Christmas, my boyfriend and I received movie tickets and a gift card to CPK for a fun movie date night. We decided to make the plan happen one night and were excited to get out, as we hadn't been to the movies in a long time.   We decided to sit at the bar at CPK because we were watching the World Cup. The bar area is probably not the most popular spot in the whole restaurant, because it only sits like 10 patrons, but we took a chance. Our bartender was a little strange. He mentioned that he doesn't drink repeatedly and it made ordering drinks a little awkward. At one point, we ordered a lemon drop shot and we asked if he could make them. He said they had a martini and he could just pour it into two glasses. Sure. Ok. Fine. I guess that works. It turns out he made each one of us a martini in a rocks glass and charged us for two martinis. This is not what we asked for. And next time, we'll just ask for a table so the bartender who doesn't drink won't make us feel weird about ordering drinks.  I believe our meal was good, I just can't get over the lemon drop shot/martini confusion. I don't mind if someone who works as a bartender doesn't drink, but they should know how to make drinks, which is their job. Part of what you're paying for when you go out is the experience and it kind of ruins it when the situation gets weird.",

I frequent this specific CPK a few times a year due to birthdays and mini-reunions and it's always the same:  Super busy, hot food, alcohol-infused drinks, and a good time.  While the place is usually packed and wait time on a Saturday night varies between 30-45mins, service is usually decent and the tables and utensils are always clean.  A short wait isn't so bad in the company of great friends.  Food is pretty standard affair.  In the end, you're really just paying for the name and a standard pizza with fresh ingredients.  My usual go-to's are the Thai Chicken hand tossed, Tostada thin crust, and the Garlic cream Fettuccine.  Yum.",

But it has a huge mound of salad on the top of it that wasn't even centered on the pizza. Granted it was pretty tasty, but it just looked awkward and was awkward to eat.   The worst part about the visit was that it was FREEZING in the booth we were sitting at . I know people in Arizona can go crazy with the AC, but this was just like I was caught in a wind tunnel.

Met with a friend for dinner there as we had something planned close by.   Food was terribly bland to put it nicely, ordered a white corn guac app, when it came out we were disappointed at the portion size first of all and we salted it about 5 times and couldn't get it to taste like anything, even with the small portion we could not get ourselves to finish it... according to my friend the spinach artichoke dip taste and quality has dropped noticeably again like the guac very tasteless, we asked the waitress how it was prepared and after checking with the kitchen, were told it is pre-packaged. Then the pasta for the jambalaya fettuccine was under-cooked.   When the waitress came to check on us and we expressed our disdain, she mentioned such to the manager. Quite to our dismay, instead of apologizing for the poor quality of the food or at least be understanding, the haughty manager ignored our concerns and continued to disregard what we had to say by telling us we were the only ones he's ever heard complain about the food, he even lied and told us that they make the spinach artichoke dip there fresh everyday! Will never visit that CPK again, if any, and discourage others to do so as well. Manager needs to learn some table-side manners when dealing with customers!",

I ordered the Cajun jambalaya fettucini that came with shrimp, crawfish (I think? there were tiny bits of something white that might have been crawfish... and I mean TINY pieces), and sausage.  It would've tasted better if it had not been absolutely overloaded with Cajun seasoning.  I know the dish has \"Cajun\" in the title, but that doesn't mean that every square inch has to have a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning sprinkled on it!  Overall it made the dish way too salty and one note.  I didn't get the creamy, buttery, fettucini sauce I was hoping for.  My dining companion got the Chicken Tequila Fettucini.  I tried a bite and it was decent, though I didn't taste tequila - just lemon.  Plus the entree wasn't enough food for him and he was still hungry afterwards.  For $14 you'd think they'd give you a bit more food.... especially since this isn't super high quality food...",

The third person came at least 15min after we ordered and had to wait for our waiter to put his order in.  After about 30min from our initial order, the manager came over and said our order was \"getting sorted out\"--which was the first we'd heard of an issue. Our pizzas finally all came out together, still with no apology or even acknowledgement from our waiter that there had been some kind of issue.  We left Tempe Marketplace after finishing and while at another store, I realized that I didn't have my Visa from CPK. I realized that the waiter never gave it back. So I had to take our entire party back to Tempe Marketplace, park, and walk back on a 110 degree day.   When I got there, I told the woman at the front desk that the waiter hadn't returned my card. She told me to get out my ID and someone would be with me. Then she turned and did a walk through the restaurant, filling water, collecting plates, etc without telling anyone that we were waiting. Eventually, the manager came out and just handed back my card, with no apology for the waiter keeping the card to begin with.   I should have known better than to go to a chain restaurant and I have been reminded again why I don't. Don't waste your time with terrible service.",

I teetered between a 3 and 4, but they get a four because despite some odd encounters with the wait staff, I'll still suggested it as a dinner spot fairly often.   I could take or leave the pizza, but I have yet to have a bad salad there. My favorite is the thai noodle one- the dressing is amazing!   Their small appetizers can even be enough for a meal, especially if you're in for lunch. I had the sweet corn raviolis and an order of the chips and guac, and I could barely finish it all. Very delicious!",

Very noisy considering the sparse number of diners.  A five minute wait got us a table and a nice young server who was pleasant and initially attentive.  Our drinks came quickly.  We ordered an appetizer (Szechwan Chicken Dumplings) and their Sicilian regular crust Pizza.  Our server asked if we wanted our appetizer before he served the pizza and we said we did and thanked him for his suggestion.  About 15 minutes later a young lady brings our pizza and places it on the table.  When I told her we were expecting an appetizer, she offered to take the pizza back.  We were hungry and didn't care for the possibility of reheated pizza so we told her we would just keep it.  About 5 minutes later our second server returned with our appetizer which we discovered to just be tepid, probably sitting under the heat lamp for awhile.  Six small dumplings with little flavor to them.  The pizza was a bit dry, could have used more sauce and more cheese despite a fair amount of freshly grated parmesan cheese she grated directly on our pizza.  I would give it a 2.5 and the dumplings a 2 at best.  Our original server returned with our bill, my water was never refilled.  I doubt I will ever try them again.",

We weren't anticipating much, as we went in on a Sunday night. We reviewed the new menu, and the only differences we could see were increased rates. That's fine, we would bite the bullet. The classic barbecue chicken pizza was fine, and we ate it. Was it spectacular? No. Would a Domino's pizza have sufficed in the same way, absolutely and for much less. The pizza alone was $17. Our waiter was nice, but clearly was having a rough night. I'm sure he's a great waiter, but the dynamics in our contact were: painful. Overall reducing our quality of experience. Mediocre food, at a higher than tasteful price, mixed with a rough customer service experience; we will not be returning to this location.",

After being seated immediately with menus,  we sat unattended until 5:10 when we decided to just get up and leave due to lack of service.

    "text": "Me and our little boy went to the California Pizza Kitchen for a late Friday night dinner. It was around 9pm when we arrived. We waited about 10 minutes for a table, when the hostess said the patio had open tables if we wanted to sit out there. We said yes. After waiting about 10 more minutes for service, I finally flagged down a server and asked for some drinks. We got the drinks and continued to wait for our server to come over. In the meantime there were 2 toddlers running back and forth on the patio, SCREAMING. A high pitched squeal that stops everyone in their tracks it was so shrill. After about 20 minutes of waiting for a server and having my eardrums pierced with the screaming toddlers, we got up and went inside. I asked for a seat in the dining room. We were seated but still didn't get a server. I had to get up and go to the bar for a drink refill. While we were waiting we noticed a bunch of dead bugs on the top of our booth. That's when I decided that it was time to leave. We'd spent almost an hour in this establishment and was not served by anyone. The bugs were just the last straw. I was so irritated because by this time it was after 10pm and I had a hungry little boy that I needed to feed ASAP. So we went to Red Robin. But It's a shame because I can remember when California Pizza Kitchen was the place to be. It was clean and classy.  Now it's run down and has slow/terrible service.",

    "text": "Came here for my best friends birthday lunch. There was a total of 7 of us.   Our service was HORRIBLE!!!!   Everyone of us but one ordered pizza! (1 large pizza, 2 kids pizzas, and two lunch size pizzas) How long does it take to make pizza???   Before that; we were given drinks (water, lemonade, tea) it took 40 mins before someone came by and asked how we were doing. No water refills, no sugar for the tea was offered so my best friends sister had to wait that long just to enjoy her beverage!   Andrew was our server. He never came by to check on us. The kids ran out of soda, we needed water refills that took a long time to come. When the food was ordered he rushed me. He never updated us on  how long our food would be after we've been waiting for 30+ mins. After we received our food, it took even longer for him to come check on us. Water refills again, our table didn't have silverware or plates or napkins. I wanted some pepper flakes for my pizza etc.   The pizza was good. I had that with the tortilla soup for the lunch combo. The soup was undesired after first try. I didn't even touch it.   The worst part about this visit was that we even told our server it was for a birthday. After they took all of our plates we were left there aimlessly waiting for at-least another 20-30 mins. The kids were getting impatient. By the time everyone started to get up to go ask for the check, Andrew came with ice cream. Set it on the table and honestly that's what we had to wait for? This place has the worst customer service and worst birthday experience anyone could ever imagine. Never again!",

    "text": "We are fans of CPK and I have been to this location for lunch and had a satisfactory experience.   Tonight, however, my wife and I were returning from a concert in Mesa so we came here for dinner about 5:30p. Almost NOTHING was satisfactory about this visit.  We asked to be seated at tables on the outside patio. We had to wait almost 10 minutes despite the fact that there were many empty tables out there. Apparently they are understaffed and either didn't have someone to bus the tables or didn't have staff to serve us.  We were finally seated, and the place was filthy. There were rings on the table from glasses from the prior customer. There was litter and food on the ground.  Regarding seating, if they are looking for quick turns, they purchased exactly the right chairs for the patio. Unless your hips/butt are less than about 12\" wide, two hard iron bars press into your buttocks. I managed to turn the chair diagonally so my skinny @ss would not be gouged by the chair frame.  We placed our order with a waitress who didn't seem to know what she was doing. But she did take our order. She never did return with sugar and sweeteners we asked for to accompany the iced tea my wife ordered; I ended up snagging our own from an unoccupied table.   My wife ordered us one of our favorites - the avocado club egg rolls. They took a VERY long time to come out, and tasted as if they had been made before lunch and left under a heat lamp all day - certainly not fresh.  When the food finally arrived, we still didn't have silverware or napkins, so the food was put down and we had to wait and look at the food while someone rounded up the tableware.  Finally, my wife's \"Two in a Bowl\" soup came. It tasted off. And it was warm, but not piping hot, so by the time it was half finished it was room temperature.  I ordered a thin crust pepperoni pizza. It was NOT HOT. The pizza itself was tasteless, although the pepperoni was spicy. And the thin crust, instead of being crispy, was chewy.  We definitely won't be returning to this CPK. We just hope this place was not representative of the level of service and quality of food at the location closer to our home.",

    "text": "Yelp Review California Pizza Kitchen 2000 E Rio Salado Pakwy Tempe, Arizona 85281  California Pizza Kitchen deserves solid 5 stars. The service I received was amazing for my Friday night with my friends. The Chicken fettucini was amazingly paired up with the amazing Raspberry Lemonade   We arrived around 6:30 pm and the restaurant was relatively packed from a Friday night. We were seated immediately. The server was really polite and very interactive with the menu. I got a Chicken Fettucini with a Raspberry lemonade for my drink. The fettucini was amazing. It was really creamy, cheesy and full of flavor. The chicken breast was perfectly cooked and full of juice. The meat was tender and full of flavor. The quality was top notched and I was not regretting getting the Chicken Fettucini. I ended my night with a Belgian Chocolate Souffle cake and let me tell you that beat all the desert I had had in my life. It was a warm chocolate cake served with Hagen Das vanilla ice cream on top, with the side of sweet whipped cream. The cake was amazing. I split it in half and there came the deliciously melted chocolate lava dripping out and it was delicious.  The service was really great. Our drinks were filled up by the time we almost finished them. The server always stopped by to see if we needed anything or how good the food was. The restaurant atmosphere was amazing because the lights were dimly lit, thus giving a very relaxing atmosphere in a very crowded restaurant. The food took almost 15 mintues to get ready which is pretty reasonable for four complex dishes. They also gave us French bread served free-of-charge.  The price was absolutely fair for the quality of the amazing food. My total cost was about 25 dollars, tips not included. The Chicken Fettucini cost about 13 dollars.   Overall, I was very happy with my experience with California Pizza Kitchen. The food, service, and the atmosphere were amazing and I will definitely return again.  (word  count - 343) Manuth Pung, Thank you!",

However, only select pizzas can be made with it: the BBQ chicken, pepperoni, mushroom-pepperoni-sausage, Margherita, and traditional cheese pizzas. The reason they have a select number is because they can make sure these ingredients don't get cross-contaminated.   The staff was very friendly and accommodating (you'll definitely feel safe ordering here if you have celiacs)! They were very quick with our order too. The cauliflower crust was amazing, it wasn't dry at all. It tasted almost like a cracker. The sweet tomato sauce and savory cheese really paired well with it. They also only serve it in one size, but it's big enough to share with two people. I thought the quality of the pizza was amazing and the substitute crust didn't take away from the flavor.   Thanks to their quick service, we were able to make it to our movie! I was very impressed with their gluten-free selections and hope in the future they are able to add more pizza options (and possibly a gluten-free pasta?) I'll definitely be back!",

I was immediately seated at the bar and taken care of by the lovely bartender. She was very attentive and took concern of my need for a prompt meal.   The decor is very modern and trendy. Also typical of what you would expect from CPK.  I ordered the steamed potstickers and a thai salad. The potstickers were delivered very quickly and tasted fantastic. They were full of robust flavor and had a spicy sauce accented by fresh herbs. The salad was also very flavorful and provided a very satisfying portion.   To drink, I ordered the hot tea which was offered with honey and lemon. There were multiple varieties of tea to choose from.   Overall a very good experience at this chain.",

There were maybe 7 tables occupied in the main dining room and there were three servers tending to tables just in our section. Took forever for drinks and bread to come out. Our food came out in a  decent time. What really made us upset was how long we waited after the meal for our checks and to go pizzas. They are running a special for $5 take and bake pizzas with the purchase of an entree so we each got a pizza to take home (4 togo pizzas total). We placed our to go order when we were wrapping up our meal. Our server brought us our checks (we had two) and they were all split inaccurately when we went over how we wanted our check split multiple times. There were 4 adults and 2 children in our party, it wasn't complicated. Our server then came back once when he was dropping our checks for the second time and said \"oh your pizzas are still not out? They are probably sitting in the back I will go grab them.\" 20 minutes later he checks on us again and brings us the pizzas. From start to finish it was 35-40 minutes since placing the to go order. We were there for a total of 2 hours. I just don't understand when the dining room is not even a  quarter full and you are fully staffed, why did it take so long? There were servers sitting at the bar just hanging out the entire time we were there? What started as a birthday celebration had us all leaving annoyed and irritated by the end of the night. Definitely not returning.",

This time, s/o and I decided to get takeout. The online ordering system wasn't working (and wasn't telling us why it wasn't working), so we called in the order. We got a call 7 minutes later (which we missed, unfortunately until 20 minutes later) saying that they didn't have any of s/o's dish, so he had to switch.  We get to the location 15 minutes later (as told to), and went to the takeout window, where we stood around for another 15 minutes before someone in the kitchen spotted us and got a server to talk to us. While we waited, I noticed that my pasta was just sitting out on the counter. I'm not positive they have a hot holding space, but I'm assuming they do, and I was a little disappointed my food wasn't  kept hot. S/o and I ended up getting the same thing (Kung Pao-his with spaghetti, mine with fettucine) and although mine was still good, it wasn't as good as his  the Cobb salad was bombbbb though (and I loved the beets!)  I did love the little touch of having the seasoned oil in a to go container to go with the bread though :)",

At first it took a while to get our drinks but our food came out within decent time. We then ordered the take and bake pizza's being told they would be out very quickly because all they had to do was prepare the pizza and put it in a box for us to take home and we would bake it later. Then we waited quite a while for our checks to come, when they arrived our checks were very wrong, we had to wait again for our checks to be corrected. Again, the store was not busy so our long waits were not excusable. Then, once we got our checks, our take and bakes were still not ready. Our server came back and forth multiple times avoiding eye contact knowing we had been waiting 30 minutes just for the take and bakes. Overall, we were there for two hours with very slow service.

The last couple times I have popped in while shopping to grab something to eat, I have turned around and walked out. This most recent time it was for the following reasons; the hostess took me a dirty table and when I asked if she could have it wiped down, she rolled her eyes and said \"I'll do it in a minute.\" While I was standing there waiting for her to come back, I noticed how dirty the entire floor was around the restaurant as I was watching 2 waitresses chase a bird (literally, a bird) around the dinning room. The manager came out and seemed frustrated that the girls were chasing the bird without opening the door first...  I'm sure that is plenty of an explanation above, however when the hostess came back (5 minutes later) she did 1 quick swipe with a rag on one side of the booth and said \"you'll want to sit on the other side, this will be wet.\" ... the other side had food crumbs all over it and the crease was caked with food.   I literally just walked out, and went to a restaurant across the hallway of the mall. I will not be returning to this location, and unfortunately it has left a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to California Pizza Kitchen in general.",

Although the place can suit all sorts of tastebuds, I would recommend going JUST for the pizza.  I went this evening for the second time in two weeks and ordered the BBQ chicken chopped salad.  It maybe could've used a little more dressing, but it was still good, so I can't complain too much.  When I went last week, I ordered one pizza from the MANY great options available, and I have to say, there is a reason it is called the California PIZZA Kitchen and not the California SALAD or PASTA Kitchen.  So 'Yay!  I'm a fan.' of the PIZZA here.  The other stuff....meh.    The servers are always pleasant here, and I never wait a long time for the food to come out.  Prices are what you would expect for a chain restaurant.  Parking isn't usually a problem unless there's an event going on at Tempe Marketplace.  The up-side to eating at this particular location is that you can browse the shopping area before you stop in or after you're done eating.  Be forewarned: If you are ever asked if you want avocado with your salad, and you say yes, you WILL be charged extra.  Look out for this sneak attack.",

The crust was awesome and the pizza was probably my favorite out of all the pizzas I've had there. One of our pizzas got burnt so our pizzas were taking forever and I needed to get back to work.  The waitress came over an apologized several times.  When she came with the pizzas she told us that the pizzas were on the house because they took so long.  This was not expected as most places in my scottsdale area would just say \"Sorry, deal with it.\"  The perks of going to a big chain I guess?  The manager also came over and apologized.

It took about 15 minutes to be greeted. We ordered our drinks and waited another 10 minutes. Finally a manager came over and took our drink order AGAIN and took our food order. She brought us our drinks and 5 minutes later our \"waitress\" brought us drinks. The food was good as always but I ran out of iced tea quick. No one ever filled it and a whole bunch of servers/managers walked by. I almost got up and filled it myself. It was just a hot mess and I don't know if I'd even return after that.",

The only time we come here is when he is taking me out to celebrate me or when he just wants to love me well. The food is why I come here. The white pizza and Hawaiian pizza are to die for. The pizzas here are probably my favorite pizzas of all time. The food (even salads and pastas) is easily five star worthy. The reason I give it a four is because it is a chain restaurant. I have become a little snobby when it comes to eating out, and I just wish I could be served the same food in perhaps a different atmosphere. Now, the restaurant is nice and everything, but it is lacking a certain unique and inviting ambiance. I guess I'm just too hipster and cool for this place nowadays. The service is always pretty good here. They used to give out bread before the food came out, but now it is only upon request. I would highly recommend giving this place a try if you are the rare 1% in the Phoenix area who hasn't.",

    "text": "Another chain restaurant opens its doors among a sea of unoriginal yet conveniently located establishments comprising \"The District\" at the Tempe Marketplace.  Like many other all-ages locales, this place was frequented by many high school-aged kids on a recent Friday night.  As I approached the restaurant I noticed couples and groups sitting outside on a dark and unheated patio.  I then went inside and joined more people waiting in a drafty and seemingly unheated entranceway.  After waiting about 30 minutes - which seemed to correspond with the time I was quoted - my friend and I were seated at a blustery table near the door.  Brr - my light jacket was no match for the draft, so we asked the first person who approached the table whether we could possibly move somewhere further from the door.  In spite of several visible open tables, she made a face and said those tables were going to be taken by larger parties, and we would have to check with the hostess.  The hostess pleasantly moved us to a table much further from the doorway but somehow the draft still wafted over there even though this table was close to the open kitchen (weird).  Still, it was definitely an improvement, and this time I kept my mouth shut.    The waiter approached the table quickly enough and took our drink orders (water for me and lemonade for my friend).  He swiftly brought the drinks and the bread (which not especially fresh, warm, or flavorful, but who really needs bread as a prequel to pizza anyway?).  After sipping our drinks and helping ourselves to a slice of the aforementioned bread simply because it was there, my companion and I sat and talked and waited about 20 minutes for the pizza and salad to arrive (in CPK's defense, my friend was the one who not so brilliantly suggested bringing the two items at the same time, as opposed to having the salad first).  The waiter remarked, \"Finally, right?\" while delivering the food, and when we responded \"Yeah...\" he replied, \"Hey, it's not my fault!\"  If even the waiter is commenting on how long it took, shouldn't there be some offer of a free dessert, or at least an explanation of what the hell was going on back there?  But we didn't dwell on that -- we were too busy shoveling Chinese Chicken Salad and the trademark Barbeque Chicken Pizza - with honey wheat dough, of course - onto our plates.  The food was good - consistent with other CPK experiences, which after all is the goal when visiting a tried and True chain restaurant.  The waiter presented the bill while asking if we wanted dessert as an afterthought.  To his credit, he remembered to get our salad dressing on the side, refilled our drinks before they were totally empty, and timed my friend's to go order of mac n' cheese just right.    The draftiness, the bad table assignment, and the rather long wait time for the food probably would not make this a very smooth choice for a date, in my opinion, but it did the job for me and an old friend enjoying a rare low-key evening.  All in all, this was about what I had expected and would consider going back the next time I'm at Tempe Marketplace for a movie with a friend.",

I would not recommend the strawberry lemonade to someone looking to avoid a sugary drink; it tasted like soda without carbonation.  However, the pizzas were shared among my colleagues; we got the margherita.  We also opted for the Mediterranean salad.  The salad had lots of onions, which grossed me out, but the hummus was delightful, so that made up for it.  Also, our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  During the busy lunch hour with a moderate sized group, I was very impressed by the service!  I would come back.",

We waited a while getting in because there wasn't a hostess at the desk.  She sat us in a nearly empty restaurant (we were there around 11:30am).  She said, \"Bread will be right out.\"   or at least thats what we thought she said.  It turns out she must have said \"Brett will be right out.\" as that was the name of our waiter.  It also turns out (because we asked) that they have a policy of only bringing out bread if you ask for it.  This seems like a stupid policy, if they want to cut costs by not just automatically bringing it out, they could just offer it and the people who don't want it could say no.  Or just take it off of their service all together.  Having some sort of secret handshake to get it just seems odd.  Maybe if we had asked for the free beer, that would have worked... who knows?",

We started off with some of their \"small cravings\" ... a little menu showcasing new smaller sides to share or enjoy before a meal. The Korean Beef Tacos looked interesting so we gave them a shot. Lets just say the only thing we were craving was our four dollars back after ordering them. Sure, cover anything in enough sauce it will taste okay. However, after eating a lot of tacos the past two weeks (been on the road traveling through CA), my money would have been better spent at Filli-anything or even Del Taco.   The main course was average, but it felt very commercially produced. No real flavor or excitement, just food.   Sorry CPK, but I won't be back anytime soon as my money is better spent elsewhere - especially with all the options available at Tempe Marketplace.",

Since I am trying to watch the calories, I had the shrimp scampi zucchini. It was good...definately something different which is nice when you are dieting. I also had a side salad that my husband a and I split. The ranch dressing for my salad had an odd taste to it. The salad came with the dressing already included. The amount was just enough for me, but my husband needed more. My husband had the chicken tequila fettuccini. It had good flavor and is a good selection if you don't want pizza. Overall the food wasn't terrible, but it wasn't amazing either.",

When date guy and I arrived, we were warmly greeted by the staff and we requested a booth.  It was Sunday night, and it was a rather quiet low key evening, so the restaurant was not exceptionally busy.  For whatever reason, we were seated in a HUGE booth that was meant for 6 people.  There were several other open booths that were meant for a normal party of 2.  Why were we sat at the booth of 6? No idea.  go figure.  Anyways, We had a foccacia appetizer and it was amazing!  Loved it!  Best thing ever!  But, Patrick's mojito wasn't quite up to par, so we asked the server and she fixed it.  I guess there was hardly any mint in it and it tasted weird.  (I hardly drink, but I will take his word for it.)  Anyways, I got the Santa Fe Chicken Pizza and it was fine. I don't remember what Patrick got, but he was happy with his food as well.  We passed on dessert and stuck around for a bit.  I really liked our server, as she was professional and handled herself wonderfully, but service was kind of slow. I don't know if they were short staffed, but at one point I was dying of thirst and out of pop, so I walked to the bar to get a new drink, and was told that one would be out in a second.  It was, but I think the poor girl was overwhelmed.  Anyways, I would return to eat here, no problem. Not a bad experience.",

There were 3 of us and they gave us one drink menu so we were sharing it. We placed it on the center of the table and While we were looking at it, the server just came and dropped a plate of bread right in the middle of the table on the menu we were looking at. Just drops it and walks a way. We all looked up at each other. While we were waiting for our drinks (a long time) a manager brought us an appetizer welcoming us as first timers. Still waiting for drinks. Then our food came, still waiting for drinks. Finally our drinks came, then another manager came by and offered to discount our food, we were thankful. One of the drinks was an odd one, the CPK signature drink so my friend sent it back. And ordered wine instead. Our server never came back around to ask us for more drinks or how was everything. Management did. However we managed to get another round of drinks in when he came over to leave the check which he had to reprint because he never came back to see if we wanted another round. Lol. So this is why I think the server was new. Good job to management for the follow-up and TIP: your server needs to be more aware of what's going on at each table. And pay attention to the order, example: server didn't remember who ordered what drink, drops the appetizers directly in front of each one of us without notice or excusing his reach. WE had to start moving plates around pushing water glasses to the side to make room in the middle for pizza and appetizers instead of dropping them under our noses. He was very detached. But I will say management was very attentive, apologetic and turned it around to make it a positive experience. Management 5  Server 3",

We each had 3 slices which was enough to fill us up but the pizza itself is below average. The flavor of both pizzas was abysmal and I honestly think little Caesars tastes better. I also have it two stars because I mean $11 for a tiny pizza? GO TO LITTLE CAESARS. Definitely not worth it. I would not recommend CPK when there are plenty of other good restaurants near here.",

    "text": "Another chain that gives you exactly what you expect, and comes through.  There's way better and unique pizza than California Pizza Kitchen, but you always know you're going to get something that you'll enjoy at any of their locations (especially since they're all the exact same).  Although it does possess that out of box and thrown in the oven chain feel.  The girlfriend and I split a half salad and pizza for lunch.  The wild mushroom pizza was pretty good.  Not greasy and the variety of mushrooms on top were pretty flavorful.  We had it on honey wheat whole grain crust, which complemented the pizza pretty well.  I wish more places would use a wheat crust.  We also split the thai crunch salad.  Really good. The Thai peanut dressing is fantastic.  Avocado was accidentally put in it (which they offer with an up charge).  It didn't cost us anything since it was a mistake, but I wouldn't recommend paying for it.  Not too much is thrown in, and it tastes out of place in an asian salad.  It cost a little more than $30 to split the half salad and pizza.  Not too pricey, although most other pizza places will give you a bigger portion for that price.  But still, a good and fair lunch.",

And I was ready to up my rating to four stars believing they had resolved their service issues, but it was not to be.  Our last visit we experienced the worst service we have ever had in a restaurant.  My husband finished his drink before our appetizers came (they were busy, so the food was slow), but the server dumped the salads off so quickly, we weren't able to ask for a refill or ask for bread.  The kitchen brought our pizza, and we never saw our server again, nor that drink refill.  Well, we did see him, numerous times, but each time, he breezed past us, refusing eye contact.  I had to flag the manager down myself to open our game token thingies.  Not easy because he was actually the server for the patio.  He was very apologetic and offered to comp our meals, but I declined.  Our meal was good, I just wanted to let him know his server was AWFUL.    So my 3-star rating remains because the food is always great, but service is just too unreliable.",

I've mentioned it many times but still always the same... So today I decided to try something new...horrible. They have a seasonal garlic chicken with roasted veggies in the menu right now. It was probably the worst thing I've ever ordered. The flavor was good. But the chicken had the skin on still...and It was gross. Under cooked and chewy. So I took it off...along with the flavor. The worst part was the whole dish comes in a bowl with inches of oil in it. Food just soaking in it. Not a great way to serve anything. Hopefully they can make changes with this dish because it could be good. It was not edible.",

Our server Bailey was very informative, recommended specific items, checked on us regularly and tended to us wonderfully.

However, if I hadn't ordered the appetizer, I would have left hungry. The ravioli needs to be a bigger serving. I've had different pizzas on other visits. My favorite is still the bbq chicken. Overall the atmosphere is very comfortable, however this time I wish I had sat farther away from the bar. The music being pumped out was too loud, to the point of distortion.",

    "text": "After a very long hot day at the art and wine festival on Mill Avenue, the GF and I decided to try a new joint (built up a pretty good appetite). Once again yelp came to the rescue. After reading many reviews about this place I was very hesitant to dine here. Seeing that we were already at the location and didn't feel like going anywhere else, we decided to get our food fix here. (Boy did I pay for that decision!).  The restaurant itself is awesome, had the right lighting, the background music was loud enough to hear but low enough to hear each other talk, and it's an open bar.   After being seated, we were greeted by a very rude waitress (Britni) who took our drink order. Five or so minutes later she came back with our waters and took our order. We ordered the California club pizza and also a peach tea. Fifteen minutes rolls by and no sign of our waitress, our glasses of water were empty, haven't got the peach tea yet (starting to get annoyed). The food runner brought out our \"eye candy\" pizza, Man - O - Man it looked delicious. Keep in mind we still haven't got the peach tea yet, with our waitress nowhere to be found I waved down another waitress, who kindly stopped and asked if we needed anything.  Ask her if she could get us a side of ranch and our peach tea we ordered 20 or so minutes ago. She apologized and said she'll be right out with it. Soon after she had left \"OUR\" waitress (Britni) shows up and ask if we needed anything. In my mind I was thinking (OMG are you for reals! Where the hell have you been!). Asked her about our peach tea and asked her for a refill on my water.   She reply's back \"Oh, I totally forgot about the peach tea\".  No apology what so ever. The peach tea FINALLY came out after we were done with our pizza.To top it off she charged us for the troubled peach tea.  Aside from the horrible waitress the pizza was awesome and full of flavor.   P.S. If you hate your job that much, please do us all a favor and quit. Go find something else to do with your life.",
