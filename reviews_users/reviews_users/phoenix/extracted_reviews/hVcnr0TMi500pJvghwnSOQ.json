We went in again last Thursday night for dinner. We sat at the bar. No one was at the hostess stand. We sat  at the bar for 10 minutes and was not even acknowledged----the bartender looked scuzzy. My husband asked a server who walked by if we could get some service. She looked perplexed and kept on walking. We got up and left. On the way out, we asked for a manager, and no one seemed to know where we could find one??? Really??? We are so disappointed as this is a neighborhood restaurant and we love Thai food, but I have to tell you that it's worth driving to another Thai restaurant. DO NOT SUPPORT RED THAI. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT SERVICE. Never again!",

We ordered pot stickers as an app, and the basil dinner entree and pho ga (which was pho with chicken). Food tasted pretty good. My only complaint is that the food took over 30 minutes to get to us (& they weren't busy). The decor was nice. The bar tender was knowledgeable. We'd definitely give this place another shot and recommend it if we have another pretty positive experience!",

It's nothing outlandish but you do start to sweat and feel the spices in dishes like the hot and sour soup.  I can't keep track of the number of thai, vietnamese, mexican, indian, chinese, you name it restaurants where I order a \"spicy\" dish and I'm left disappointed in the heat level.  They put a unique twist on a lot of dishes which I appreciate.  The hot and sour soup was like no other hot and sour soup I've had and they sometimes even warn you when you order the Pad Thai that it isn't going to be exactly like the dozen's of pad thai you can find in any restaurant here in Phoenix.   The Anime behind the bar can definitely lead to some amusing conversations...",

Although I basically ate the same things on both trips, I guess I can say they are consistent.  My favorite dish was the hot and sour soup with shrimp.  I expected it to taste like the usual you find in every Chinese restaurant.  I was sorely mistaken.  Theirs is so much lighter, very spicy, but less on the sour.  I also tried the kobe pho which I did like, but it seemed boring compared to the hot & sour.  We also tried the pork gyoza and spring rolls, both very good.  My surprise of the night was the fried tofu my friend suckered us into ordering.  One, I hate tofu.  Two, see number one.  Well apparently, much as the State Fair has figured out, you fry anything and it becomes delicious, especially with the dipping sauces.  In fact, it kind of reminded me of paneer.   Unfortunately, what's also consistent is service.  Not terrible, but could be better.  My husband and I asked for small bowls since we were sharing the soups.  We had to ask twice.  I ordered a bottle of sparkling water and had to ask for a glass.  It was a one litre bottle.  Just little things that could be better, but overall, I really enjoyed both visits.  Oh, and they run anime movies on big screens behind the bar.  My husband loved that.",

    "text": "Checked out this restaurant on Saturday with my sisters and the bf to try something new. The outside of the restaurant didn't seem inviting but once you step inside the restaurant it looks cool. The ambiance was great! There were anime series projected in the wall near the bar. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant where the booths were and it was fairly comfortable.   Our service was decent. The server gave good suggestions and was helpful with any questions we had. He checked up on us a couple times. Overall pretty cool server.   We started off with the sugar cane pork as an appetizer. They were big portions and the sauce that it was marinated in was rich and sweet. The breading was delish but the inside was kind of dry. The Bf had the Kobe Pho which was very tasty and had a lot more meat and other ingredients mixed in then we expected. It was really good. One of my sisters, had the Red Thai Chicken and rice. The chicken was  nice and crispy. The other sister had one of the specials; I don't remember the name of it but the broth was savory just a bit oily though. It had thick udon noodles with a variety of seafood. I had the spicy red curry. It was okay it wasn't what I expected. Something seemed to be missing but overall it was eh. We also all ordered Thai tea for drinks and they were good. It was very light and not thick as what other restaurants would make thai tea.   Definitely would come back to try  their other appetizers and entrees they have. :)  I actually got the chance to try Bo Luc Lac today only because the Bf brought me lunch to work and got a to go from this restaurant. The salad was delicious! The vegetables were fresh and the meat was sweet and tasty!   I probably sound like a fatty in this review tasting everything haha! I was just curious and wanted to try the different dishes :P Check the place out!",

    "text": "I do not recommend this place.I will  not be back, and I will be telling my friends to stay away. We asked the waitress what she recommended and she raved about the pad thai.  One person in  my party asked before ordering if the pad thai had many vegetables.  The waitress said yes, it has LOTS of vegetables.  It in fact had next to none, and on top of that had a bad vinegary taste.  My friend (who is normally not picky or complaining) took a few bites and then couldn't eat the rest  When asked about it, the waitress said: \"you can add vegetables to it for $2.50 more. \" Wow. Our dishes were all brought at different times. When mine finally arrived, the sizzling shrimp, I was stunned by the size--it was more like appetizer size, and did not come with rice--which it really needed--the rice was extra.  The dish was tasty, but a rip off for the price. When we explained our concerns to the waitress, she apologized but did nothing about it.  She needs some training in how to deal with customer complaints.  (But so does the manager.) So we asked to talk to the manager, and when we explained it all to her, she proceeded to be defensive and say she'd been doing this for 10 years and this is how they've always done everything, and she was sorry we didn't like it but it's not for everyone, and how she was going to better train the waitress so that in the future when we came back we would have a better experience.  Unbelievable! I've got news for her--there won't be a next time for us.   If I'm not mistaken, at least some of the restaurants they've done in the last 10 years have not done so well.  If this is how they operate, not surprising, and I doubt this one will make it.   There are so many better restaurants in the area, and so many good Thai restaurants in the city.    This one  has nice ambiance, but they have a long way to go with service and food.   Some friends were at the table next to us, and they said that the service was poor, that the drinks didn't come until long after the appetizers, and the waiter said \"well you're just slow.\"  Blaming it on the customer.    Wow!   I guess they haven't heard that the customer is always right.",

Place: This place locate in a strip mall in the same area as Carlos O'brien Mexican Rest. right next to the 99 cents Store. Inside this place are well decorated with futuristic flare. They have projections on wall showing some sort animated japanese cartoons, quite interesting concept for a Thai food place. Wait staff: Very good, water refills frequently, only bad thing was that there were carrots in my curry! Carrot messes up everything.

We came here and you cannot find a better HH in the area. The appetizers were $5 and needless to say we ordered them all. We wanted the full Red Thai experience and it was WOW! The best item (again for $5) was the Sugar Cane Pork! Unbelievable pork wrapped around sugar canes and coated with a crispy sauce over the pork! Wow! The other dishes were just as good! You need to try the sauces mixed with them which really highlighted the appetizers. The BEST! We did come early in the day (HH is 3-6) and few customers but the staff very helpful and knowledgeable. Kudos to the bartenders Jeremy and Jillian who were very personable and professional. One final note is the bar. It is very long and the TV screen which is the back of the bar area (which is huge) shows sporting events and anime if you are into that. It's awesome! I highly recommend this business.

Not exactly the smell I was looking for, but I figured they just cleaned the floors or something... at 6pm though? The smell got stronger near the bar, so I think they need to check their dilution ratios. The overwhelming bleach smell was very off putting right off the bat.   I was severely disappointed with the Pad Thai and Yellow Curry. The Pad Thai was nothing special, but definitely one to remember. There is no way I could have eaten more than a fourth of this dish due to the spiciness. They need to implement a spice level, if they have one, it wasn't asked. It's already 110 degrees outside, no need to make your customers sweat more during the summer! It also lacked the traditional Pad Thai flavors and was mostly noodles.   The flavor profile of the yellow curry confused me and that's never a good sign. I kept going in for more bites because I couldn't figure out if I liked or disliked it. I do have to give them kudos for loading up the veggies in this dish though.",

As you walk towards the restaurant, you'll notice his signature night light theme; violet, bold red, and let's not forget statue of Buddha!  As I walked into the main room, first thing I notice was Anime movies playing across the walls behind the bar.  The wall is literally the screen projector.  Overall, the place gave off a nice vibe and energy!  I came here with a group and as we ordered our drinks and we couldn't wait to be seated to order some bites!  We started off with some appetizers; Spicy Mint Shrimp, Thai Fried Chicken, Saigon Egg Rolls.  All sounds pretty exotic and it was.  I have to proclaim this; I love the Spicy Mint Shrimp!  I could eat that sauce with rice any day and any time!  Spicy indeed, while the onions and mint gave it a pungent aroma along with some texture!  The Thai Fried Chicken was good and crispy and cooked to perfection; the way it should be! The Saigon Eggs Rolls was a nice compliment to finalize our appetizer round; nice and crunchy along with a refreshing papaya salad.    Moving on to the entree we ordered the Sweet Ginger Fish.  The Thai ginger sauce was definitely sweet and it was glazed over chunks of breaded fish.  Overall, I liked it, but not as much as my appetizers.  The sauce was okay, but I would have liked to see the entire fish fried and battered then glazed with the sauce.  I think I'm an old school Asian that can appreciate that sort of presentation. - Enjoy!",

Might have been kind of cool if it were a Friday or Saturday night and I was there to kick off a wild evening, but this was lunch time during the middle of the week. The music started off depressing, and then got uber-creepy. That, coupled with the bad food and lack of lighting (not mood lighting -- just no lighting) made me not ever want to go there again.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointing after all of the great reviews. It's sister restaurant, Sochu House in Central Phoenix is much better. We had the Shrimp Spring Rolls, Pineapple Fried Rice and the Spicy Basil. The spring rolls were not bad if you used the sauce (which ended up being the best part of the meal). The pineapple fried rice was bland and yet burned my tongue with sodium. It was made with crushed pineapple instead of chunks which meant it had no pineapple flavor unless you ate one of the minuscule pieces by itself. The spicy basil was so salty that it was practically inedible. We also had thai tea which was nothing outstanding. Overall, I would say avoid this place unless you like bland, salty food.",

Overcoming sickness so I was still a little stuffed up and I ordered the lemon grass soup. I must say it definitely swept me off my feet, perfect flavor and great amount of spice. It is a little on the spicy side, but I love love heat! I will most likely return with some friends. I can see this place getting real busy on a Friday or Saturday night.",

The Thai ginger sauce was definitely sweet and it was glazed over chunks of breaded fish, the Chicken and Shrimp Pata was unbelievable..wow! JUST GO!

I'm not exaggerating in stating that this is definitely the worst Thai food I've ever had (from dozens I've tried), but it could be the worst Phoenix restaurant I've experienced in my 10 years in the valley (and I'm a foodie).  I got the yellow curry. Bland. So hot I burned my tongue after letting it sit for 2-3 minutes (a restaurant no-no). Absolutely no flavor. If I was to rate this dish from 1-100, it would *maybe* get two stars and only because the color was yellow. I also tried a few other dishes and sub-par would be a compliment to those as well.  I certainly will not be back.",

From the outside, Red Thai looks drab and unassuming in a mediocre, run-down strip mall. Don't be afraid!! Once you enter the restaurant, it is like being in a completely different place! Interior design is light, airy and open. The dining room is much larger than I expected, with a long bar the length of the room. I really like the giant buddha on the back wall.  We ordered sweet and sour soup to start, which was spicy but very tasty! This is not your traditional soup - it has a really unique flavor, but definitely delicious! I had yellow curry with vegetables for lunch and my friend ordered some type of stir fry. The portions are huge so plan to have leftovers!!  Red Thai is a great place when you're craving Thai food but want something more unique than basic pad thai and red curry. I highly recommend trying this restaurant if you're in the area. Great affordable dishes with original flavors and a relaxing atmosphere! 5/5 stars!",

In fact, one reviewer wrote that they are \"trying to be something they are not\" due to it being next to a dollar store and a (outstanding) hardware store. I say, \"Good\"!

First , the menu they handed me was so dirty it was disgusting to touch it had dried food all over it. Their water tasted like chlorine and they don't have too many options on beverages unless you're drinking alcohol, they don't even have fresh brewed iced tea of any type there. The two female Asian managers or owners were arguing about another customers meal that was sent back because they didn't like it. they then decided to make the people eat those plates anyway... Obviously the other customers refused asked for their check and left abruptly. It was awkward that it happened in front of all of the customers in the restaurant. When ordering food it was very difficult apparently the cook in the kitchen does not like to make any substitutions or eliminate an ingredient if somebody is allergic to it so basically you get whatever he feels like making. I ordered a salad and asked for the dressing on the side because I do not like very much dressing on my salads and apparently nobody is allowed to order their salads like that in the restaurant you have to have the dressing on the salad because apparently it's the only way the salad tastes correct.  It seems the waitress was more interested in pleasing the kitchen cooks then pleasing the customers.  Our orange puff chicken appetizer was totally disgusting and had no flavor at all we did not eat it One of the dishes we ordered came out incorrectly after how strongly the waitress stood by with the cook puts in things it was still wrong. So basically we got an appetizer and two meals we did not eat any of it they did not care they did not offer to take it off of our bill or help us in any kind of way.  I got the vibe that the two Asian managers spend most of their time bad mouthing their customers. I will make sure to never eat at any of the other establishments that this man owns. A truly horrible dining out experience!!",

Our son has celiac and is 3 years old. Redthai advertises gluten free options and the phoenix new times has written great reviews in regards to the owner of this restaurant. We went to eat here tonight. Again, our son is only 3 so he isn't going to eat spicy chicken pad Thai and or curry chicken etc. we were told by two servers that the chef would not deviate from the menu. We asked if the chef Would make him grilled chicken and rice or grilled chicken and rice noodles. The servers still said that they would not Make it for our son. Are You kidding me? What chef would not be accomodating to a child with allergies. i guess we thought wrong about this new establishment. What a bad impression. My family and I are natives to central phoenix and we have been to many restaurants in the valley that are much more accommodating to our son and his needs and we have no reason to go back here. Obviously  We got up and left this restaurant knowing that  we would never return.",

    "text": "Three of us came in during happy hour for an early dinner on 11-19-2014.  We sat in a booth and inquired about the wine.  We were told that we could not get happy hour prices while seated in our booth.  Happy hour is only available at the bar.  Our waiter told us we could move over and order at the bar and bring our drinks back to the booth but he could not serve us drinks at the booth.  I found this to be a ridiculous policy.  We came in to relax and enjoy one another's company, not spend our time moving over to the bar so we could get a glass of wine and then move back again to drink it with our meal.  We drank water and did not pay for alcohol for this reason only.  When we ordered one person in our group requested a separate bill.  She was told that each separate check is $2.00.  Seriously?  I eat out a lot and I have never heard of such a thing.  Whoever is making the rules in this restaurant apparently doesn't care that they are offensive to customers.   I worked in a restaurant for many years and we always went above and beyond to make our customers feel welcomed and valued...and respected.  Red Thai operates on a different level, apparently.  Too bad.  The food is good but the quirky rules make it a turn off.",

Both soups looked and tasted pretty much the same, prepared from what tasted like a powdered soup base. But for $7.98/plus tax for the lunch special you can't really go wrong, especially given the generous portion sizes.  Both of our soups were full of tender chunks of meat, served with nice heaps of bean sprouts and mints leaves. Red Thai was extremely clean and nicely decorated, and their bar looks like the kind of place people where people would hang out sipping cocktails in the evenings or weekends. We will likely be back for more.",

The one thing that disappointed me the most was their lack of knowledge on specific food that weren't Thai. I ordered \"bo Luc lac\", a Vietnamese dish. This is normally beef cut into cubes, marinated, cooked and stirred with sweet white onions, and topped over lettuce. This was nothing like that at all. The beef were in super thin slices, marinated with some salty sauce and left all dry looking in a bowl next to a plate of lettuce, carrots, sesame seeds and sauce? Tasted nothing like the Bo Luc lac I've ever eaten at restaurant or home made by my mother. I don't think they should have named this \"bo Luc lac\" because it's going to customers who aren't familiar with this great dish a False impression of what it really is.  Second order was clams in basil sauce and third was their chicken lollipop. Both were so salty I couldn't even finished. I normally like salty things but this was more than I can handle.  Needless to say, hubby and I didn't finish any of the dish ordered. Not authentic what so ever.  I love supporting small local businesses but I won't be back. Sorry Red Thai.",

I suppose by Arizona standards, where crap ethnic food is the norm, Red Thai manages to stand out as one of the better options for Asian cuisine in the area. But if you come from L.A., San Fran, New York, etc. you're bound to be disappointed as you've been by many other Asian establishments in The Valley.   I REALLY like the bar. It is the stand out feature of the place and I think it's a shame that they close so early because I think they could do a decent business later at night with the bar crowd. I know it's a little isolated but other than North Central Sports Bar, there really is no other place nearby to catch a drink and I think these guys are missing out but not staying open later.  I would certainly be open to coming in again. If they stayed open later I would be a in a lot for drinks and late night munchies.",

They also have a nice patio area too.  There is happy hour so you can definitely take advantage of that.  I decided to try the edamame (hh), red chicken curry and sweet potato fries (not happy hour items). The edamame was really good as they added truffle oil on them.  The sweet potato fries were good, but who can really mess up frying sweet potato fries unless you don't know how to fry?  The red curry came a little later than expected and as a regular entree, it was not a big portion at all compared to other Thai restaurants I've gone to before.  The curry was ok - lacked a little flavor, not very many veggies, and there was probably 5-6 small pieces of chicken.  At first bite, I thought  \"eh\".   I mean yes, this place is quite hip like, and trendy - but I don't think the quality and quantity of the food should diminish. Overall, I would consider coming back again.",

They have a great lunch menu, great price, but it's dead. The staff is really good at holding up the bar with their bodies. Basically leaning on it all day. It's rare to get a smile out of them, it's more of a \"ugh, how many? sit here.\" and a dead pan face.  I don't know if they inject sleeping pills in the water or what, but getting some sort of energy out of any of the servers would be a feat. It's also going to take the entire hour lunch, because of the staff. The food comes out quickly, there's no issue in the kitchen. It's how long they wait to get your drink order, then food order, then check, it's kind of silly.  Thank goodness that damn curry is so good, it makes up for the lack of customer service.",

Now my concern was Thai is spicy food so if you never get a refill, this becomes a dire situation.  Not the place if on Lunch hour.    The Pad Thai is very spicy, but was actually delicious.

    "text": "This is not my first time at Red Thai. I have been a few times over the years. But this was my first time in a couple years. I was always a big fan of the food. My history with the food goes back to the old days at one of Johnny's preceding restaurants called Fate. It was a sad when they closed. But back to Red Thai in present day. The food is great, I still love it, at least what I was able to sample recently. The service left a bit to be desired unfortunately. So much so I doubt highly that I would come back. There are plenty other places that would welcome my business. After standing at the front waiting to be acknowledged for a while so we might be seated. After being seated we were greeted by the server, Jasmine. She seemed she was in hurry. Pretty short with taking an order and never asked if we wanted a drink or an appetizer. My friend ordered a curry and the server immediately said \"Chicken?\". He replied no and asked for shrimp. She asked me and again after i order she immediately says \"Chicken?\" I was good with the chicken but again never asked about a drink and she left in a blur. My friends food came out about 4 or 5 minutes before mine and it was chicken instead of shrimp. It wasn't until she came back to give me my meal that we were able to tell her my friends meal was wrong. No apology or sense of admitting a mistake she just took the plate back and now he had to wait 5 minutes for his food. Once the corrected order came out the food was great. No complaints there. Jasmine never did come back to check to see how the food was or ask if we needed anything else. After we were done she brings the check and bolts and I had to ask from a distance do you have dessert. She replies \"Actually, we are closed\". I just kinda sat in disbelief she said that as the receipt she just printed out even said 8:56pm on it. I understand it was pretty close to 9pm and that/s when they specify that they close, but does that mean you literally boot the people out the door at that time? There were still 4 other tables eating as we walked out. Shame on you Red Thai. You could use some better help or a manager more on top of things.",

There are booths, tables, and a bar, along with an area toward the back for a DJ who according to the staff will occasionally drop by to rock the 1s and 2s in the evenings. The staff is excellent as are the chefs, managed by locally renowned chef Johnny Chu.  I ordered the Pad Thai wondering how it would compare to my favorite Thai places back in OC. I can say without a doubt that RedThai's rendition is right up to par with them. The level of spice is right on point and the flavor is all there and then some. They give you a generous portion at that! For a beverage, I ordered the Thai Tea (how can you not, right?) -- again just as good as I remember it being in Cali.  It's safe to say I will be back here again, maybe for an after-work happy hour type situation.",

The waitress who served us had to ask continually over and over again what we wanted to order. I know it is loud in there, but maybe that is an issue? My friend and I specifically stated we did not want overly spicy food. Our food later came out inedible almost, due to the extreme spice level.  We did not get much of a drink refill, and the check took over 20-30 minutes, though it was not terribly crowded.   The food seemed great, beautiful in presentation. The fried tofu app was yummy. However, the curry I ordered (and said mild spice) was to the point of not even good, as it was too spicy. I love spicy, but this was over the top. I brought home the leftovers, and ended up tossing them before even getting home. The spring rolls with shrimp were delicious and well flavored, though, so there's that.   The ambiance is super cool and fun. There were videos playing on the walls, and the restaurant featured a DJ.    The parking is fine, just in a strip mall with other stores.",

The papaya taste was barely discernible and overall didn't have the lunch or tang of any papaya salad I've ever eaten. If anything, it was watery and if this is the same as the salad portion, I would stay away from it. The egg rolls are weird tasting with no flavor at all. This is atypical from regular egg rolls, I get it... But it just doesn't taste good.  Entrees were udon chicken special and bf got Sizzling Shrimp.   For both of us, we werent asked spice levels so we did not think of anything of it but holyyyyy molyyyy they were both SO spicy. I just ate what noodles I could abdllnd avoided the rest.  Yeah yeah I get it, it's Thai food and I think even the Sizzling Shrimp had spicy in description. But both bf and I are not strangers to spice...There's another Thai place we frequent. But we both could not finish our plates; there so much chili on my plate I had to scrape it aside. We're not those people that have their entrees redone though I'm sure they wouldn't mind doing it.  Please be forewarned!!  The rest of the menu seemed uninspiring and you can pretty much get every item on there elsewhere.  Lack of stars for disappointing appetizer, dismal menu, and high price for what you get. Seriously, you can get a lot of these items for a lot cheaper and it would be better tasting at  local Chinese and Vietnamese places. Also factored just a little bit is the crazy spice levels.... Just a little bit though, because we could have said something but they really should have been more clear on.",

Anime playing on the wall behind bar running the length of the restaurant, a huge mural painting on the back wall, buddha statue at the entrance. Who knew such a hip restaurant could be in our neighborhood in this little strip mall?!  The food lived up to how awesome the restaurant looks. We had the egg rolls, spring rolls, chicken lollipops and the pad thai. Everything was on point. The egg rolls are mini which makes them very crisp and tasty. The shrimp spring rolls were very fresh and the pad thai was done very well without being greasy at all. My favorite, though, were the chicken lollipops. They are what I would call sophisticated chicken wings. Sweet but not too sweet, some spice, really good quality chicken, and just a little messy.  We will be back and I hope everyone in the neighborhood supports this place because it's a True gem.",

He is currently standing in front of me at the bar, ONLY tending to two guests, and is loudly speaking about his $400.00 phone bill and why that is - \"I f*cking watch too much mother f*cking porn.\"  Hmm. Ok.  That's great. Do what you want, but please for the love of the hospitality industry and courtesy for those around you, TRY to act as though you are a business owner or respectable human being at the very least.  His style of customer service (or lack thereof) has clearly bled into the rest of his staff. Every bartender and waiter I came across was cold, inattentive, and a carbon copy of their boss.  This is the worst dining experience I have ever experienced in my life. Needless to say, I will never return to Red Thai.  I advise you all to spend your money elsewhere.",

I tried the ginger peach tea and Pho Thai dish. The tea is nice and cold, it seems to work well with my dish.  The Pho Thai has beef and rice noodles in a soup form that reminds me vaguely of ramen. It's gluten free since the noodles are a rice noodle, there are scallions and onions in it and it comes with a side dish that contains bean sprouts, a few jalapeno slices, some herbs and a spicy sauce dish that you can choose from to add to your soup.  It was delicious and a huge bowl so I ended up taking more than half of it home.   This was on the lunch menu so it was $8 for the soup, a great deal for the amount of food!

This place works great for that.  The amazing large screen cinema and the ingenuity on that are worth a trip here if nothing more than to see something unique and interesting.   Creativity and boldness score high marks for me, as that is what I try to do in my legal practice.    The general ambience, cinema and the music create a nice experience.  The miso soup was really good, but unfortunately I cannot give my highest recommendation on the other dishes (as usuall with a new restaurants we sample several things our first time around).  The chicken and meat plates (I forget exactly what they were called) were not the best for me, and the wings were a little \"gamey\" (I actually wasn't even sure they were chicken).  At any rate, nothing ventured nothing gained.  To cut it short, I would go back, sit at the bar with my friends or clients and mark this as a great place to go catch up with old friends while enjoying the movie at the bar and music overlay.  The bar is suuuuuper looong in lenght and supper cool.    Again, my kudos goes out to the owner (who stopped by the table to say hi), and for turning a dead retail space into something amazing.  For me, it is a meet your friends/clients at the bar kinda place to get the night started or deal done.  For that reason alone, I am a fan.  They also have outside seating which scores points.  Keep up the good work.  I driove by tonight and saw a really packed crowd, so perhaps taste buds differ, and that is cool too.  A good crowd makes for a great time.  Have fun, and find your sizzle!

All of the savory, delicious Vietnamese flavors of Bun Bo were totally missing.  So sad!!!!!",

Very nice interior considering they're in a strip mall next to a 99 cent store and a now closed Fresh and Easy.  I'm hesitant to support chef/owners who open and close restaurants over and over again. I'll give this one another 6 months or so.  I ordered the Red Curry, as the \"to go\" menu is much more limited than the regular menu and figured I couldn't go wrong.  Wrong choice!  Not the same ingredients as described on the menu, and not nearly as spicy as I was promised.   To give them credit, they do seem to have a good happy hour menu/drink specials.  However, I won't be back.",

    "text": "I went last Saturday to have a late lunch in the early afternoon. The restaurant was relatively empty with only few customers. I ordered chicken pad thai and the meal did not resemble typical pad thai I usually got from other thai restaurants. It was watery and disgusting. On top of that the chicken was not thoroughly cooked and I have the proof (PICTURE). I told the server that I can't eat this because the chicken was not cooked. He then asked if I wanted to order something else and I decided to have the same meal my husband ordered beef basil. I made a bad choice, I should have sampled prior ordering! The meal was as bad as the chicken pad thai. It was salty and beef was hard to chew on.  I was utterly disappointed. I do not blame the workers but I blame the management. They do not provide enough training for the cook to ensure food quality and SAFETY are properly maintained (HELLO UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN). What really irritates me the most I was charged for UNDERCOOKED chicken pad thai (my husband should have reviewed the bill before make a payment). I disputed the bill which then the server refunded our money and made us make another payment with the correct check.The server did apologize but I did not feel like it was a genuine apology.  There were tons of 'hiccups' and 'surprises' dining in this place.  Servers are the nerve center of the business and they should be more attentive to customers' needs, be more observant and deliver a genuine care. Again this is management problem. Management should have trained its workers to meet with the standard of exceptional quality of customer service. I will not return until you fix the system in your restaurant!",

She took a while to take our order despite being one of the only groups in the bar area then didn't ask if we wanted to order food or another drink. She took down the happy hour menus 15 before happy hour was over...as people were walking in and sitting at the bar. The hostess should wear a little more clothing and act somewhat happy to be there...I mean, she is greating people. I look forward to trying this place again, hopefully will have a better experience..  *side note- they really need to clean the Windows!",

I was there last night and my companion and I had two nice dishes and a wonderful relaxing conversation. I noticed that there were two morons here tonight who just each placed one star reviews because they thought their food was too spicy, even though they liked everything else about the restaurant. That is absolutely ridiculous. For one, I've never had anything here that was too spicy, and secondly if it was too spicy, in this restaurant the staff has always been extremely courteous in exchanging the dish. The two idiots who placed one star reviews from tonight must've had some other agenda. This is a wonderful place to take a date or meet up with friends, and for a Thursday night we were surprised that there must've been 60 to 80 people in there when we arrived at dinner time. The acoustics are such that even with this many people it's easy to carry on a conversation with the members of your table. I would highly recommend you coming to this restaurant and having an enjoyable evening. Is this a perfect restaurant, no, but I really can't think of anything but nice things to say about it. Great atmosphere, a fun drink selection, and an interesting, eclectic, very tasty and fairly priced menu. I probably gave it an extra star just because I'm too angry with the two individuals who abused the Yelp system tonight with one star reviews for this very nice establishment. If your food is too spicy and you don't say anything then that's your problem, give the restaurant a chance to fix it and don't be a jerk here on Yelp.",

    "text": "So we are beyond embarrassed because we convinced friends to come from Paradise Valley to this restaurant due to great past experiences.  Oh....where to begin.....  We arrived at 8:15pm.  The bartender yelled at us across the bar that it would be one moment.  He turned around and yelled \"DOOR!!!!\" towards the kitchen.  Odd....but okay.  He looks young so we gave him a pass.  A young woman came to the hostess area and instead of \"hello\" or \"good evening\", we got \"we close soon, how many?\". You close soon at 8:15 on a Tuesday?  We sat in a booth and a young female server came to our table.  Our friend ordered a pinot grigio.  The server's immediate response was \"I think we are out of that\".  She literally turned around and yelled at the bartender \"do we have pinot grigio? (which they did) My husband ordered a Maker's on the rocks.  Once again, the server turned around and asked the bartender if they were stocked.  The bar was out but no alternatives were given.  My husband said,  \"how about a Tito's and soda?\" No Tito's or alternatives given.  We had to ask for selections of vodka.....  We were overall so frustrated by the lack of knowledge and service that we left without ordering food.  The bar looked half stocked and the staff was dressed like they rolled out of bed.  A bus boy had a Nike workout shirt on and our server looked like she just grabbed something off the floor.  The only reason for the two stars is the cucumber martini was very well done and the atmosphere was really cool.  We couldn't help but think the restaurant is going out of business soon.  Half stocked bar with mediocre staff tells us they are short lived.",

    "text": "*Spoiler alert: this place is NOT able to make much of a  dish*  I went during happy hour, 3pm - 6pm, to see what this place was all about. I ordered a $3 kilt lifter and some pot stickers to begin with. Had zero issues with either menu item.   But lets talk about the decor for a second. There are these projector screens playing some type of animation behind the bar, but it's barely visible. There are like a couple of LEDs, but not enough to capture the ambience that I'm sure they wished to. It's dark in this place, which can be cool IF you understand basic lighting techniques.   So I ordered a basic Pad Thai dish and asked them to make it Firey as possible. I was thoroughly disappointed . They even had a side sauce that the bartender said \"you could buy at the store.\" What? What's the point of paying $15 a dish if they can't provide you with quality product?   I don't think that I will go back knowing their limited kitchen capabilities are so very sub-par. Too bad RedThai, I thought we could have had something",

First the veggie egg rolls are not fresh they are the frozen kind. That when you bite into them the gushy veggies inside squeeze out the end.  I can purchase these from Costco too.  There is a reason that I don't.  Next I had the tofu Pad Thai.  Honestly it was/is tasteless.  Considering how quick this meal made it to my hotel I suspect that they don't cook fresh food and that this has been sitting around for some time.   My advice run!",

Our server was a delightful person but so overwhelmed and the place was not that busy. Felt bad for her but the management needs to look closely at training.  Decor is amazing however. One full wall of anime cartoons floor to ceiling, cool graphics, spacious. Very hip. Good choice of background music, seating comfortable. Bar huge!  Food did arrive after our drinks and was good. We all had  excellent martinis, perfectly mixed. I had coconut shrimp and shrimp spring rolls. Sister had noodles with brown sauce, good. Right brain had Red Thai deep fried Cornish hen, was dry but flavorful.   All in all I feel some work needed on front of house. Due to the holiday I figured things would probably be not normal. Next time hoping all the issues are worked out because it really is a cool place. Happy Holidays all!",

We shared the... Saigon Egg Rolls - 8 crispy mini egg rolls with a spicy but sweet dipping sauce and a side of papaya salad. These are not your typical egg rolls. The outside was crispy like that on that dessert Baklava but warm and inviting in texture. It didn't have that overfried thick oiliness like most egg rolls do. Instead it was light and flavorful and perfect. The cool papaya salad balanced the lightly fried egg rolls.  Truffle Edamame - the Edamame was bathed, not sprinkled, with truffle butter oil. I'm used to most places just sprinkling a bit of truffle oil but here, because it was melted truffle butter, I was in love with this Edamame!!!  We both ordered the beef pho, Pho Tai. It was a hearty portion even at lunch. The broth was flavorful and enjoyable. I would order it again!  I guess at night, there are projections on the walls over the bar. Sometimes it's anime, sometimes it's art. I would like to see it at night while having dinner or grabbing a drink. There is definitely a chic warehouse vibe to the place. I like it! Definitely a hidden gem like other reviewers have mentioned!",

    "text": "My fiance and I tried Red Thai last night (Saturday) for dinner.  We walked in and were seated right away at a table.  Our initial impression is that the music is way too loud, the anime on two enormous screens is kind of weird, and the oddly long bar actually seemed to have more seating then the restaurant.  The bar goes the entire length of the restaurant with at least 30-40 seats (maybe more).  We were there from 8:00 - 9:00 on a Saturday night.  Every table and booth was taken with restaurant guests, but there were only 3 people at the entire bar when we got there - which dwindled down to one lone guest at the bar who looked to be waiting for their take-out order to be prepared.  On to the ordering.  Our waitress was adequate, but nothing special in terms of service.  We asked for ice tea and were told they don't have any kind other than bottled ice tea - which were both sweetened.  So, we declined and stuck with water.  My fiance ordered the special of the night - which was an udon dish with shrimp.  I asked the waitress what she recommended for a first timer there.  She  asked me if I like spicy food.  I said that I did, so she recommended the pad thai, so I ordered chicken pad thai.  We also ordered an appetizer of coconut shrimp.  The coconut shrimp came fairly quickly and it was excellent.  The two dipping sauces were different from what is normally served with coconut shrimp, but they were both quite tasty.  My fiance's udon dish came out next.  We thought my pad thai would be following quickly behind.  It wasn't.  We noticed several other tables near us in the same predicament - one guest with a hot dish served while the other guests (or guests) were waiting.  So, while several dishes were sitting there getting cold, other guests were stuck waiting.  And it wasn't just a minute or two.  My dish took a full 7 additional minutes to come out.  Other guests also seemed to be annoyed and kept looking over at our table.  When my pad thai finally did arrive, it was delicious.  However, my fiance's udon dish was served with tail-on shrimp.  Now, keep in mind this is a  very saucy dish.  Does the chef expect people to fish the shrimp out of the sauce, and then carefully cut off the tail on the narrow rim of the bowl?  Come on.  It was ridiculous.  In addition, cutting the shrimp left an unsightly mess along the bowl rim.  Ugh.  When the waitress came by to check on us, I asked her how the chef anticipated people to eat the tail-on shrimp in this dish.  She said, \"I don't really know.  It's just how he does it.\"  So, while the food was tasty, there were problems with this restaurant.  They appear to be trying too hard to be something that they're not.  This isn't the Biltmore area.  This is a strip center restaurant between the Ace Hardware and the 99 Cent Store.  The service was marginal and the timing of our meals out of the kitchen was not acceptable.  When we asked about the tail-on shrimp, that would have clued in any experienced server that there was a problem.  This waitress practically chastised us for questioning the chef's decision.  For these reasons, you've been chopped.",

We had the japanese miso soup and the Tom Yum for our broth. The miso was delicious! Although the Tom yum tasted exactly like my mom's tamarind soup which was a bit strange but I didn't mind cause it was still tasty.. We also got shrimp, shabu beef, mussels, baby bok choy, fish cakes, and udon noodles on the side. They were all fresh and so yummy. Not bad at all.",

This restaurant has the most striking atmosphere of any Thai restaurant I have ever seen.  60 feet of anime running all along a wall.  A giant picture of a man on the back wall.  It was stunning just to look at.  We ordered the Sugarcane Pork or an appetizer.  It was great.  It looked like a drum stick.  What I first thought was a bone turned out to be the sugarcane.  The pork was wrapped around it.  I have never had anything like this but I will be ordering it again.   I ordered Pad Thai.    I always order Pad Thai at Thai restaurants.  This one tasted a bit lighter than most.  It still had a rich flavor and I enjoyed it.  There was defiantly  a little Vietnamese influence and it works.  They have a good selection of Pho as well.  I will have to try that next time.",

I'll admit I'm a bit of a light weight when it comes to spicy but others in my party were not such light weights and agreed that it was HOT HOT HOT.  Every other thai place i've tried in tow will ask how spicy would you like it, but here they didn't ask.  My bad because i didn't even realize the weighted didn't ask when he took my order.

Very interesting and entertaining descriptions. The have awesome cucumber water instead of plain water. Had the spicy red curry and it had a good spice to it. My husband had the pad thai and enjoyed it.   My husband's complaint was that his beer (IPA) on Draft was warm. I tried it and agreed that it should have been colder.

    "text": "Okay.     Following my review for lunch, I've been here a couple of times for their happy hour cause some friends were raving about it, plus, it's fairly close.   I've had the truffles edamame,  the almond chicken, pork pot stickers, and the orange puff.    You must absolutely try the truffles edamame.   A tasty mixture of spices are added to the truffle oil and the flavors pop in one's mouth.   The sauces for the pot stickers and the almond chicken are on the mark.   The martinis of the day were the mango, which I changed from being made with gin to vodka, since I enjoy vodka more than gin, and I'm glad I changed.   It wasn't too sweet, and had just a hint of ginger.  I don't like my drinks too sweet.   Yummm!!  The martini of the day, the prior day, unfortunately, I can't remember the name.    All I remember is it was pink.   Sorry!   Our HH server/bartender the first time was Chase, and the second time Diana, whose Vietnamese name is My Lien.   Why she goes by \"Diana\" is beyond me.    She is actually a school teacher, and this is her summer job.   Too bad she can't work there all year.    Diana is especially nice, friendly and helpful.     I asked Johnny if the food is fried in peanut oil, since both of my children are allergic to nuts.     He said no, since a lot of people have a nut intolerance/allergy.   I think he said they used olive oil, but I can't remember.   So that's a good thing, not using the peanut oil for frying.  I would go back.   The only thing that bothers me, is when I am with nonAsian friends, Johnny (the owner) totally ignores me when we are having a conversation.    Should that bother me?    Dunno.     I wasn't the only one who noticed that.    Just saying. ...",

Took my wife and toddler tonight -- instantly given a dirty look when I asked if they had a high chair.  \"You're looking at a 20-minute wait, at least\" said the abrasive hostess. \"Would you like to wait?\"  \"Yes, we've been looking forward to your restaurant opening. We live down the street! Why such a long wait? I see at least ten open tables...\"  \"Oh, it's part of our grand opening. All of these tables are reserved,\" said the hostess.  [thirty minutes elapse. DJ in the booth cranks techno mashups from his Macbook Pro. Japanese anime triple-projected on the white wall behind the bar]  I politely checked back in, and the hostess gave me attitude, again. In a demeaning tone...\"another ten-to-fifteen minutes.\" I solicited for some basic empathy considering that we have a hungry, and increasingly ornery kid.  She repeats: \"I said, another ten-to-fifteen minutes.\"  Half of the tables retain \"reserved\" status. We probably would have been finished with our meal by now. It was obvious we were not wanted. Especially after my daughter pitched her sippy cup on the concrete floor and got the stink-eye from the mixologist.  We drove to 19th ave and enjoyed a meal at one of our favorite, family-owned places -- Thai Lotus.   Johnny... WTF?",

    "text": "I really love Thai tea. So does my mom. So naturally, on our first and only visit so far, we told waiter-man to ring up two of those!  While we were deciding on what to eat, ONE Thai tea comes to the table.   \"Sorry, this was the last tea. We are all out.\"   Really?? And it's only lunch time? I have never heard of that in my enThaier (see the Thai pun in there?) experience at restaurants. The one saving grace was we were not charged for the single tea.   Onto to the food... My mom's red curry was really good, better than my entree which consisted of WAY too many crispy noodles! And we did share some sweet potato fries that were quite yummy.   The ambiance is interesting, but I had a roommate that was obsessed with anime so it's not really my thing.   Overall, not too bad for a new restaurant, and the vibe can be cool, but wouldn't mark it as a fav.",

    "text": "There was no wait for me because I met a party down there and it was about 4:45 so the place was empty. Sat down, ordered a water and started talking with my friends.  Waiter comes by and I order potstickers and edamame to start with. (my usual apps in any asian restaurant) The waiter says right off the bat, \"There's a $2 sharing fee\" I'm like, \"Seriously? On appetizers?\" He shook his head and laughed, \"No just the entrees.\" This place must really have an issue with that so the staff must be trained to say that but slow your roll, I was just ordering appetizers bruh.  The potstickers weren't anything special...could have fried up some that were from the frozen bag and they would've tasted the same! Hate that they provide an odd number of potstickers. Doesn't make any sense at all and causes nothing by frustration.   The truffle edamame was pretty addicted but, in the end, a little too \"garlicky\" for my taste. It was a big hit for the table so at least none of us were embaressed about garlic breath. :)  I ended up ordering the Crispy Noodle Island. It's a cool concept having crunchy noodles with the veggies and sauce softening the noodles. The problem was that there was too much sauce! Like WAY too much. The menu also failed to mention there were bamboo shoots in them...eww (it's a texture thing) Not quite sure what my boyfriend ordered but he was thrilled about it either.  Best part was dessert! Cream cheese/goat cheese wontons with strawberry sauce! So freakin good!! Loved it!  It's was neat that they were playing anime in the background but I would've really enjoyed if they were able to play some Sailor Moon...especially because it's on Hulu now :3  The price was decent! $40 for 2 apps, 2 entrees, dessert tax and tip! I still wouldn't come back for food but probably drinks and dessert so meh...",

    "text": "We are having such a great time working our way through the menus at Red Thai.  They're just down the street, and having a Thai restaurant this close is like finding your favorite ride at Disneyland without a LINE!  We try to go at least twice a week.  Last night we had the Red Thai Tofu and Orange Puff Chicken for apps.  They are amazing!  The tofu is flash-fried so it has a texture almost like French Toast.  I'm not always a fan of tofu, but this stuff (and the two sauces that go with) are the bomb!  For dinner we had Spicy Red Curry and the Crispy Noodles.  I asked for extra chicken on my curry and it was no problem.  Sitting at the bar we entertain ourselves by watching the anime projected on the walls and chatting with the staff there.  Johnny, Linda, Chris, and Josie are so much fun to relax with.  Congratulations on your new restaurant!  From the soft open to the grand opening, we are loving this place and the people that make it work.  I see that a couple people have had less than perfect experiences here, but this isn't Panda Express.  This is an experience.  Trust the menu, trust the chef, and trust that you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "This place was okay. Nice decor, but I don't think its authentic Thai food. More like fusion. My friend Sage and I ate here last night because it's in our neighborhood. We wanted to support new businesses, so we checked it out. He ordered a chicken dish that reminds him of Chinese food, and I ordered the Tofu Phad Thai. We eat Thai food all the time and have been to many different places. The Phad Thai didn't taste like real Phad Thai, and we both felt like it was missing something. We don't know if they ran out of the extra ingredients, or substitute the food with something else. Our bill came up to $36 plus tip. A little pricey for Thai food that taste like Chinese Food. As far as the ambiance, the place looks clean, they play a mixture of pop, and rock music, and the video screen has Japanese anime. So we were confused about this restaurant.  Very trendy and I didn't see any Asians except for the cooks in the back, and one waitress. It was weird! It's a restaurant for white people. I guess they are distracted by the stylish atmosphere and Happy Hour prices. I'm giving them 4 stars because the service was fast, and our servers were friendly. You know what they say... If you see tons of Asians in an Asian restaurant, you know it's good. They know authentic Asian food! This is more fusion.",

They have a neat mural of Buddha on the wall and three large projector screens which was neat but they were playing Anime, which for me wasn't really entertaining. They have a nice bar area as well.  Food: We ordered the Lemongrass Tofu Pho which had a really great spicy broth. Really good broth actually. I wasn't into the large pieces of tofu though. Also got the Steak Pho which my bf liked but said the sauces weren't making the broth spicy enough. We also shared a plate of the Pineapple Fried Rice which was really tasty! Really loved the rice. I would go back again and try something else on their tasty menu.",

When I looked through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I was almost disappointed I couldn't go inside, but the I remembered I had a new patio spot (walking distance, yay) for my favorite companion to join me. The servers were very sweet and brought me a bowl of water for my pup while my friend and I previewed the drink menu. I ordered a cucumber infused martini, but was actually carded, and because I haven't replaced my license since losing it at O'hare's TSA, I was denied that service. Hey, at least they're being up and up on that, and I'll definitely be back in the future, with proof of age on hand (my dinner partner had a lot of fun at my expense at \"getting carded\").   The black dragon with shrimp was fantastic! The baby book choy was so fantastic I could have had a plate full of just that, but then again, the black bean sauce, the shrimp... Well I ate everything on the plate like a proper glutton. I will definitely be back, sooner than later, and may possibly become hypnotized by the projected anime films and the tempting cocktails. And I plan to eat my way through the entire menu. I'm so happy Johnny's in action in my neighborhood!",

    "text": "This review is an update on the food and experience. The restaurant is tasteful with upscale decor and art. Very clean inside and out. My first dining experience was \"OK.\" This is a restaurant I would suggest not to go to for lunch time if your in a hurry. I arrived at the restaurant at 11:05 on the dot. I was greeted right away. My two friends and I sat in a booth in the middle of the restaurant. The cozy seating and place settings were another added charm to the nicely decorated restaurant. Intrigued by the lunch special my friends and I ordered the following. Chicken Pho for me, another friend ordered the Green Papaya Salad and the other friend ordered the Yellow Curry. No appetizers for any of us this time. My food did not arrive until 11:40. We were the second customers in the restaurant. I feel that our food was very simple it should not have taken this long. I will also mention the friend who ordered the Yellow Curry did not come until 10mins after we got our food. I did see two people come in for a carry out order along with a man place an order to go during this time. I think it is a timing issue. The restaurant being new I think they will get better on timing when they get use to the flow. The service was good and the waiter was tentative. My friends and I thought the food was pretty good. I am going to try them again to give them the benefit of the doubt. I am happy to see a nice classy thai place move in the area. This area needed it. I'm looking forward to a better experience next time around.",

    "text": "I've been to more Thai restaurants than I can remember. . .  . . .though I remember the first one as if I ate there yesterday. It was a small dinner on the north side of Chicago. The decor featured 1950s style formica topped kitchen tables with mismatched chairs. We were the only non-Asian customers. We even had to bring our own 12 pack of beer purchased at a nearby bodega. But I was blown away by the food which featured intense flavors (and heat) like I had never tasted before. If Yelp existed back then I probably would have given it five stars. Needless to say I've been hooked on Thai food ever since. . .  . . .but, I've never been to a Thai restaurant like Red Thai until last week. Everything from the decor to the drinks to the menu says this IS NOT your traditional ma and pa Thai restaurant, but rather, this IS what 21st century postmodern Thai restaurants and Thai food is all about.  Though the stylish decor and the big screen video projectors looping Asian anime are the first thing that catches your eye and attention when you enter the premises -- this is a restaurant and in the end it is all about the food and drink.  I started my meal with a spicy martini seasoned with ginger and chilies. It cleared out my sinuses! I probably wouldn't have one of these on a regular basis -- but as a novelty it was interesting and worth trying.  For my entree I ordered Pad Thai with shrimp. Be forewarned -- it is quite spicy hot -- but that is the way I like my Thai food so it was OK with me. What surprised me was that it was saucy, more like a Thai curry than a traditional Pad Thai. At first I wasn't sure it I liked it but It grew on me with each bite -- probably because all the essential Pad Thai flavors were there and I do like saucy dishes.  My son is vegan and there were several vegetarian/vegan options on the menu. He was fully satisfied with his selection.  It wasn't very busy the night we visited so service was fine. The portions were ample and I took something home for lunch the next day.   Was this the best Thai food I've ever eaten? No, definitely not. But it certainly was far from the worst -- actually I'd put it in the top 25% of all the Thai places I've eaten at. I'll probably be back when we visit Phoenix for spring training next year. (And I wonder now if that place in Chicago was really five star good.)",

My girlfriend and I meet here for happy hour from time to time. They recently changed some staff. But what we noticed is they charge for every little thing, my friend wanted some hot sauce to mix with her soy sauce for Edamame's and they charged $1.00 for sauce she was not aware until she received her bill. We also noticed the wine pour to be about 3 to 4 ounces now so we chose not to have wine. We asked for our bill separately as we always do and they charged both her and I a split bill charge. We were shocked and said this is not right and they made excuses and took the $1.00 off. I do not recommend this place unless you want to be charged for every little extra basic thing.",

Worst service! Beware! Had a groupon and tried to charge us the full price after redeeming our groupon!!!! Unacceptable! I overheard the waitress talking bad about us and mocking us.

    "text": "We are big fans of Chef Chu's restaurants (Fate, Sens, Sochu House, etc.). His sauces are wonderful. Red Thai is no exception! Although Fate will always be our favorite of his past places, Red Thai is close to our house and much bigger, so we never have to wait for a seat.   It's a great place for family dinners or dates. They cater to a variety of tastes and diets - with gluten free and vegetarian items, and many vegan options (but are not labeled as such, so you have to ask the server).   My usual choices are the Red Thai Tofu and the Spicy Basil with Tofu. They coat the tofu and flash fry it, so it's crispy on the outside, soft inside. My husband likes the Black Dragon with tofu. I also love the Spicy Red Curry. It's a thick, almost gooie coconut milk-bases curry sauce - very different from typical Thai curry.   I've tried a few of their funky cocktails, but haven't found one I like yet. Last visit, I had the Red Kiss. It was strong, but the flavor was too savory for me. My friend had a mango-based one and liked it.  Service is usually spot on, with decent pacing and usually no errors. Sometimes Chef Chu will stop by our table to say hi, which is nice. And I can't forget to mention the anime films they usually show behind the bar. It keeps things interesting! It is a bit pricy - so not an everyday choice for us - but it's usually a fun night out!",

I loved every bite that I indulged in. I ordered the Pho Tai soup and very tasty. I also ordered the Crispy Noodle Island with chicken. My husband ordered the House Dynamite it was good but too spicy for me to handle. I promise there is so much food in the plate you will end up taking leftovers for sure. The decor is pretty and love the ambience. The only reason I had to give this place 4 stars is because it took forever to get our waters refilled. It was to the point we waited so long that my husband had to go up to the bar and get it refilled. I don't know if it's cause we mentioned having a groupon prior to eating that everything changed but I really would like to give this place another shot. As a Yelper Groupon is the great affordable way of getting to try new places without having to cost a fortune and being able to review the businesses.",

It was still quite good and full of veggies. The waitress was chatting after the show ended and I walked my own bill to the bar to hurry her up.  The drag show was just okay.  Not great but not bad either.  Overall I was not impressed.  It would take a LOT for me to be enticed to go back.  Like a lot.  There are too many other places to try in a city of this size.

Very pleased with the quickness of service and the food. Sesame ginger chicken was very tasty and my 4 year old enjoyed it. Thai noodle soup, wow, so good! Thin sliced beef, yummy noodles, spicy lemongrass broth to die for. Red curry chicken, lots of sauce (how I like my curries) and very clean tasting.   Definitely going to be coming back!

Immediately fell in love with the ambience of the setting and the Wall of Anime playing while obscure and alternative music played. Had the lemongrass soup was absolutely amazing.  They are careful with their preservatives they utilize and do not use the standard ones.  They proudly serve vegan/vegetarian choices. Can not stop going there, so refreshing for Phoenix dining.  A real experience",

    "text": "You might say that we're always ready to \"Thai\" one on! You know, take a \"wok\" on the wild side! One of our favorite places that features a melange of tempting tastes from the mystic Orient is Johnny Chu's popular Sochu House on Central Avenue and Thomas Road. He's expanded, and now you can try his newest venture, Red Thai, a clever little bistro featuring an Asian fusion menu with the emphasis on Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. You'll find Red Thai in a thriving strip mall at the southwest corner of 12th Street and Northern Avenue.   Some tried and True crowd pleasing favorites from Sochu House found their way into the menu here, like the Sugar Cane Pork with \"the other white meat\" marinated in ginger lemongrass panko with pineapple ginger sauce, skewered with a small stick of sugar cane for $7.98. A new kid on the wok, errrr, \"block,\" is the Almond Chicken, where the nut coated bird is flash fried and served with spicy sweet sour dipping sauces. Two nicely sized skewers are $7.98. The menu denotes that the Orange Puff, a crusted white meat chicken in a spicy tomato sauce ad topped with orange zest is \"spicy,\" but we didn't agree. More spice. More orange zest.   \"Salad\" territory gives you six different ones from which to choose. The Bun Bo is a spicy bowl of stir fry onion and beef, cucumber, bean sprouts with spicy nuoc cham (a delicious fish sauce) and topped with peanuts and crisp shallots for $9.98. What the menu didn't tell us is that this is on a bed of cold rice noodles. We couldn't help but wish that there were more crunchy, fresh, crispy bean sprouts (we barely found any). There's potential for this, but the cold rice noodles didn't work for us. Sorry! Please turn up the spice on this one!  A big hit was the amazing Green Papaya Salad. Choose tofu or shrimp accenting a bowl of shredded green papaya, Asian mint, peanuts with a divine sweet and sour dressing. The fresh, crunch and bite of the julienned papaya along with the breathtaking mint makes this perfect year 'round, but especially for the summer. $8.98  Entree choices are mouthwatering. Try the Sweet Ginger Fish ($14.98). Crispy (still buttery and tender) white fish is served with snow peas, bell pepper, onion, pineapple and baby corn in a sweet ginger sauce, Kind of a traditional \"sweet & sour\" but the luscious, mild fish gives it a different kind of spin.   Tackle the delicious Crispy Noodle Island ($11.98) with baby bok choy, mushroom, carrot, snow pea, broccoli, baby corn and onions in a brown garlic sauce. You can choose either tofu, shrimp or chicken to grace this dish. The crunchy bed of the crispy noodles\" will give you plenty to work on.   Nine other entrees round out the menu. Fans of Pad Thai will enjoy this super spicy dish for $11.98. An outstanding bonus at Red Thai are the many vegetarian options along with a few gluten free choices, too. These requirements can make dining out with a few guests a challenge if they have dietary requirements or restrictions.   A highlight of the Red Thai experience is the jewel-like space, featuring a 70-foot long bar with a gold, glittering portrait of Buddha covering the 20-foot high wall. Behind the enormous bar Japanese anime is projected, creating a fantastical wallpaper that's captivating, yet unobtrusive. A night visit is when this venue shines with the modern Asian theatricality that only Johnny Chu and his wife, Linda Q can do. We look forward to Chu's Shabu Fondue opening next month, with a selection of broths simmered for hours. Think \"Melting Pot\" but without any cheese.  Speaking of the bar, don't deny yourself one (or two. Or three) of their magnificent cocktails. Let that handsome David Ugorowski create something special for you. be careful! You just might find out what one night in Bangkok feels like when you wake up the next morning, so be responsible!",

Our server was great - knowledgable and pretty attentive. Atmosphere was fun a gorgeous bar and three projector screens playing football (when we arrived...foreshadowing...).   LIKE IT: The Crispy Garlic shrimp and papaya salad were great. Recommend you brave it and eat the entire shell as recommended. (We compromised and ate the shell but left the heads.)   LEAVE IT: For some reason we switched from playing Sunday night football to an episode of anime... Creepy, but I couldn't stop watching. Days later and i'm still trying to figure out what happened... Not enough to keep me away though, I'll be back for more Pad Thai and some of the pho on the menu we didn't get to try.   All in all gerat experience and would recommend to people i like.",

Nothing was, so I made my way to Fresh & Easy to grab something for the hubby and I.  Then i saw the Red Thai sign.  We've seen it before, but hadn't yet given it a try.  The establishment itself is 5 stars in my book.  Modern, clean lines, OMG streaming Anime via NetFlix x3 on the walls behind the longest bar I've ever seen!  So cool.  First time and take-out so we ordered a couple of items to share + save.  Chicken Pho (VERY flavorful), Chicken Pad Thai (medium spice and delish but way stingy on the chicken) and RedThai Chicken & Rice (very bland/basic chicken that my 6 yr old loved, good rice but I won't order again).  Good service (for what it was...) and we will certainly be back for a proper experience.  Definitely one of the better Thai offerings around town!",

Raised booths in the center are flanked by tables and a huge bar that runs the length of the interior.  The atmosphere hovers between casual and semi-casual: As the sun went down the lights dimmed while anime continued to play on the walls (silently). It's a nice inviting space that would work in a variety of dinner scenarios.  Beer selection was good, with a few local specialties and the usual asian imports: Kirin, Sapporo, etc. I can't speak to the cocktails but the bar seemed to have an extensive collection.  Onto the meal. The food was good. My group ordered a variety of appetizers and entrees which we split. The focus is on Thai, but there are a few Vietnamese items on the menu. Overall it was great. Things were toned down a bit (less fish sauce/chilies) but the tastes were fantastic. The stand-outs for me were the sugar-cane pork appetizer: minced pork formed around a piece of sugar cane, fried and served with a sweet, tangy sauce; and the green papaya salad: fresh, crisp and deliciously spicy with some added sambal sauce.  I had a great time here and I'd definitely go back in the future. Especially to check out their happy hour. Good prices on appetizers and drinks, though you are restricted to sitting at the bar.",

There is alot of it so that is the main bonus in eating here.    But caveat emptor...both my dining companion and I were unhappy to discover when our checks came that we were charged more than 50% more than we expected to pay.  Lo and behold, the substantial upcharge for shrimp is buried in the fine print at THE VERY BOTTOM of the menu.    This seemed very much like False advertising and we were upset that it wasn't obviously printed in the menu where the price of each entree was listed.  When we brought it to our server's attention, her reply was essentially \"tough, it's printed at the bottom.\"  No oh, I'm sorry, let me see what I can do..  I vowed never to return b/c there are plenty of restaurants that clearly display the price of items that I order.

    "text": "I was glad to see what I thought was a new Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. The Thai food options are a little limited with standards like Tom Yum Soup, Thai Beef Salad and Pad See Yew missing from the menu. Noted under it's name is the description \"southeast asian kitchen.\" There are some clearly Chinese choices like Pork Pot Stickers and Sizzling Green Bean(s),  as well as Vietnamese Pho and Bun Bo. But there are also some less Asian sounding at least dishes like Sweet Potato Fries and Chicken Lollipops. They have made an obvious attempt to make this place a little more \"hip\" by including a huge bar and some upgraded interior design ideas versus your normal Asian decor. It seemed funny that with the enormity of the bar, we were never offered any alcoholic beverages or anything other than water for that matter. We started with the Shrimp Spring Rolls (fresh not fried) and were well pleased. The dipping sauce was spicy, sweet and had a hint of sour. Yummy! My wife had the Thai Salad with tofu and was pleased with her choice. According to her, it was spicy and she enjoyed it. I opted for the Yellow Curry with chicken and I too was pleased. The curry was the right amount of spicy and was full of ingredients that you don't normally get above the standard potatoes, onions and carrots. Mine also had baby corn, sweet potatoes, pineapple, snow peas and green bell peppers. I thought the sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes was a great choice. There was no dessert menu, but our server told us that they had Goat & Cream Cheese wontons with Strawberry puree and sprinkled with powdered sugar or Strawberry Cheesecake. No brainer right? The wontons were excellent. BUT, you only get two wontons just larger than a quarter for $5.00? Really? Although I'm not sure that Red Thai will ever be able to utilize it's ginormous bar, I hope that they will concentrate on refining the menu and ultimately improve. I know restaurant openings can be cumbersome and fret with \"bugs\" but I sincerely hope they will iron out the kinks and remain a viable option. I think cutting the bar way down and adding some additional seating would help the process immensely. (see pics)",

    "text": "Visiting Phoenix looking for good (or at least decent) Thai food....found Red Thai. Let's start by saying I don't normally write my reviews at the restaurant, but since I have been waiting around this restaurant for more than 30 minutes I need something to do.  Al I can say is - I hope the food is good, everything else has not been OK...First we waited for SEVERAL minutes at the \"PLEASE WAIT TO BE SEAT\" (not a typo...by me) sign before we were even acknowledged, even though there were lots of empty tables...we started dreaming of Olive Garden.  We were finally greeted and given a table.  The waitress took our drink and appetizer order quickly. Of course we hadn't had a chance to review the menu for appetizers so I order the chicken satay, but was quickly told they didn't offer chicken satay (?), so we ordered the gyoza.  The appetizer was yummy, and it was fairly quickly delivered.  But then we waited, and waited, and waited for our dinner order to be taken, when I finally called her over to place the order the surprises began.  My daughter has decided on Pad Thai, but with mild chile as she is not a fan of hot food.  The waitress - who is knowledgeable, if not very friendly - advised that this was not a \"traditional\" Pad Thai, and it was one of their hottest dishes.  She could only recommend a couple of dishes that were not hot, so she recommended to go off menu with a noodle dish that is not too hot.  We ordered that unknown dish.  I typically like a green curry, but that is not offered at Red Thai (?), so I asked if the Yellow Curry was very spicy.   She said no, it was \"probably a 3.\"  Maybe I should have asked \"out of?\" Because after waiting a long time (dreaming of McDonalds...maybe the ads are right?  I might want a Big Mac...) the food was delivered and my curry was OK, but pretty bland, definitely not hot.  And I needed to request salt, which was surprising too. My daughter's off the menu noodle dish was essentially chicken lo-mein with rice noodles.    After waiting and waiting and starting my Yelp review...Overall nothing offense about the food, and it was probably slightly better than average.  BUT - the service is poor, especially the long, lonely wait just to be seated. And the menu is weird...no chicken satay? No green curry?  No noodle dishes that were not spiced?  Spice levels cannot be requested by the customer?   Weird restaurant, busily playing strange anime cartoons on the wall (so they cannot be ignored), with a weird menu.  Overall...disappointed.  I would not return (if I lived in Phoenix!).    As a review of Yelp - please let us give 1/2 stars!  This restaurant is definitely a a 2 & 1/2 Star (since the food was OK and the waitress helpful - if not friendly - to avoid an otherwise too spicy dish), but I cannot give them three stars (due to the lousy service and weird limited menu), so 2 stars it is.",

    "text": "This Thai and Asian restaurant is truly one of the best in the valley. The owner of Fate created a superb menu, using very thoughtful ingredients in the dishes that create the perfect texture, taste and balance. For example the yellow curry has pineapple in it instead of potatoes. It brightens the dish wonderfully and is not only inventive but totally works flavor wise. The lemongrass soup is wonderful and the flavor is strong as a True thai soup. I love how the dishes have strong thai basil in them. You can taste the difference. I plan on repeatedly eating here bc I need to try everything on the menu. Please note, there aren't any mild dishes. That's the only con I could come up with. I love spice, but my mom couldn't eat with me, she's sensitive to spice!",

I've tried the spicy lemongrass soup with tofu, crispy noodle island with tofu, yellow curry with tofu, and sizzling green beans as an appetizer. My favorite thing here is the yellow curry with tofu- it's so creamy and flavorful. The ambiance of Red Thai is another thing that makes it stand out from the rest. On the outside it looks basic as it sits in a strip mall next to a hardware store but inside it's pretty hip. Large screens playing Anime surrounding the bar while rotating local hangs on the opposite end. Occasionally there's a DJ too. The staff is super friendly and attentive. Great date spot. Worth a visit!",

My first time have edamame and I don't get why people like it so much. It was O.K.   Now the service was outstanding at Red Thai, and the bar area has a really cool feel to it. I plan to stop after work sometime and tryout the happy-hour. Overall, it was a great experience and the owner (Johnny Chu) stopped to say hello. I will definitely be back to try some other menu items.",

They have options for VEGAN and GLUTEN FREE.  They've accommodated us for other food allergies.    The decor is an open space with rotating local art, booths, tables, and a long bar.  The customers are a diverse crowd, and we love eating and hanging out here.  They do live jazz music every Sunday, they have live DJ's frequently, and otherwise play tasteful lounge dance music.  They project anime onto the walls which makes the place even more colorful and alive.  If there is an important game on they will project that, but this is not a \"sports\" bar.  They also have a live drag show on First Friday's after hours, that was a surprise but I had a good time.  I've eaten at this restaurant countless times, and can highly recommend the food and service to anyone.  Johnny Chu's other spots have been great. He supports the local music and arts scene, so lets support Red Thai... it's amazing.",

    "text": "Come here with an open mind that Red Thai is an Asian fusion restaurant or you'll be let down like my hardcore, Vietnamese foodie father with high expectations for Vietnamese food.  Since it was lunch we all ordered a lunch special which, was a lot more food than anticipated as we could've shared everything family style.   I got the Pad Thai, mom got the Yellow Curry and dad got the Bo Luc Lac. The Pad Thai I got was made with rice stick noodles, so they were thinner and not the same noodles used for Pad Thai, it was a lot more soupy and wet versus the drier texture typical of Pad Thai. It was pretty spicy, good flavor, just wish it wasn't so wet like a soup or used such thin noodles. This came in a big enough dish to share between two or three. The Yellow Curry was typical to any curry I've tried made with chicken and best with white rice. The Bo Luc Lac my friends, is anything but that ... Bo Luc Lac is typically made with beef filet, seasoned and sauteed with onions and bell peppers served with red (tomato) rice and salt/pepper/lime to dip the meat in. This was more like stir fried caramelized meat with salad. My dad was obviously upset and felt cheated as what they served wasn't truly the Bo Luc Lac it is known to be.  The service was great, lovely waitress and the restaurant was awesome and hip. With a huge bar, booths and artwork for sale. It was interesting to see from photos that they show anime on the white walls behind the bar from the projectors. Decent prices, but like I said keep an open mind and enjoy the Asian fusion of flavors of the dishes here.",

We only waited a few minutes but standing there unacknowledged is super awkward for any amount of time. After that our service was just a little slow and he didn't know the menu totally but it was fine. The important part, the food. It was really great and the servings were large. We shared the edamame, which was a little greasy,  but pretty reserved on the truffle. Those went fast. My kid had the gyoza as a meal but I didn't get to try one, she basically inhaled them. I had the lemongrass tofu soup. Let me stop there,  they have tofu options on lots of the dishes but also a few that are made to be veggie, like the one I ordered.  That's a nice touch. My soup was rich, spicy and flavorful.  It had plenty of tofu and so many noodles I couldn't finish it. 5 stars on food for sure. Everyone else liked their food as well. The specialty martinis rock, we all ordered them and loved them. I had the Thai tea one but I only ordered one because it was so delicious I drank it down instantly. I had to switch to beer.  I will agree with the other reviews and say it's a little pricey for what it is but not horrible. The setting is cool, with the industrial feel and anime on the wall. The downside- the high ceilings combined with whatever A.C. system they had resulted in it being incredibly muggy. It was a monsoon night so maybe it's better when it's not so humid. I'll return and see.",

    "text": "First, this is NOT a thai restaurant.  It is a club-like bar that plays boom-boom house music, where men in suits meet to discuss business and drink cocktails. All it's missing is a dance floor. They also happen to have a bunch of seats and serve food. I can't fault them too much for that, I just wish I would have read that before going in, as it was not at all what I expected to experience when I see the words \"thai restaurant\".  Second, the food. I ordered the red curry. Although it was labeled as \"spicy\", it left a lot to be desired. This is the southwest, where is the heat?? That's just a personal preference, but other people who want hot thai food may want to ask for it to be cranked up a bit. However there is a bigger problem. I'm pretty sure my curry was \"assembled\" rather than \"cooked\". There is no way this was made from scratch. Things that might not have come from a can or bag or tray in my curry: bell peppers, sweet potatoes, and maybe the rice. Prepackaged tofu; preprocessed carrots, onions and snow peas; baby corn; canned pineapple. It just all tasted a bit fake, like the cook had just given up. For an $11 curry (and $2 for extra rice?! It's RICE. That's like, the cheapest food item on the planet) and with all the positive reviews I expected much, much more.  I keep seeing how inflexible the staff is to alter/ make accomodations and I can't help shake the feeling that maybe it's because everything is already made, just waiting to be heated up and sent out the door.   This is my very first yelp review. Based on the over 100 people who seem to inexplicably love this place, I felt it an obligation to forewarn other people. Overall it wasn't terrible. The food is decent, but it by no means deserves 5 stars. It's just that not one single aspect of this lunch was even \"better than average\". Heck, I might still order something else to be picked up and see if any of the other dishes are better, but I absolutely will not be returning for a dine-in experience.  Basically, I suggest reading Scott C.'s 4-start review below. Everyone has personal preferences, and all of the \"good\" things he lists are the exact things I dislike. I wish I would have read that before going. So, pick your poison I guess.",

Love the openness of the space inside and the minimalist decor works well here.  The Japanamation is also a fun touch on the walls.  They have martinis similar to Sochu as well as the wonderful sugar cane pork.  Red Thai, you're a little further away but worth the drive.  I can't wait for my next red martini at Red Thai.",

I ordered the Pad Thai w/ tofu & it was way too spicy to the point where I couldn't enjoy my food. I usually like spicy and I can handle, but this was just too much. It tasted really gingery as well. The portions are huge, so I think that's good for their pricing. But overall, the food was okay. The environment is very chill & open.",

    "text": "Touchstones. In my adopted city of Phoenix (don't tell the Princess, I tell her I'm a native), I have a handful of areas that stick out to me for know and unknown reasons.  12th Street and Northern is one of those areas.  Carlos O'Brien's with their turquoise dome anchoring the north end of the lot, across the way, the fluorescent green of Fresh & Easy has replaced the orange neon of the now extinct Osco Drug.  Ace Hardware with it's trademarked red beacon beckoning DIY'er has attracted another red renter of Phoenix strip mall space: Red Thai.  A belated birthday meal at the P's insistence caused me to open Yelp and check my hundreds of bookmarked \"need to checkout\"-yes, I don't just \"like\" your check-ins, I lust after your culinary exploitations :).  So thank you for recommending Red Thai, I can now too.  Very cool vibe and terrific Thai food.  I kicked off our celebration of my 52nd year with a cucumber Pearl Martini which was awesome and believe me, only one is needed.  The P loves coconut shrimp so we started with those and they didn't disappoint.  Light coconut flavored panko coating with a tasty array of dipping sauces-we knew we were in for a great evening. We progressed to the hot and sour soup which was a delight.  Wasn't a typical hot and sour but delicious nonetheless-give it a try.  My entree was the dynamite XXX with chicken and the P stayed on the safe side with yellow curry with chicken.  I typically like to have the chef kick the heat up a couple of notches to blow my head off but the waiter instead offered to bring addition chili paste or Siracha and I'm glad he did, the dish was perfectly balanced with taste and heat.  The P's yellow curry needed a little salt but she was perfectly happy with it after a couple of shakes.  The portions were very generous and we ended up with enough to take some home.   The 70 foot bar with anime showing behind it was full of lively conversations and content patrons enjoying the satisfying servings of Red Thai on a beautiful Phoenix evening.    We're looking forward to going back and building a relationship with the newest inhabitant of my Phoenix touchstone, 12th Street and Northern.",

    "text": "I checked out Red Thai on a weekday evening for dinner after I purchased a Groupon. One of the things I enjoy about Groupon is that often you find new places you may not have visited otherwise, for example Red Thai is about 30 min away from where I live so it was a special trip. My gf and I went inside and it was dark, moody and had screens up on the wall with cartoons/anime playing. It seemed pretty cool but what was not cool was waiting to be greeted. We waited and waited, and looked around, no hostess at all and only a few staff members waiting on their tables. I actually considered leaving because in the past when my visit to a restaurant has started off this way, it hasn't ended well. Luckily a server came by and said someone would be right with us. We waited a few more minutes and a different server stopped by and sat us down with menus. I asked him if they were shorthanded and he informed me that it was only 2 servers, the 2 bartenders and no host. I've worked at restaurants in the past so I get it, they basically had 6 tables each at the moment and were busy running food, wiping down the dirty tables, taking guests orders and answering the phone, it's a lot! However, not many guests of your restaurant will be as understanding, someone else would've left so I suggest to the owners please get a host/hostess in the future. Anyhow moving along, we started with the coconut shrimp appetizer which was probably one of the  best coconut shrimp I've ever tried. We ordered the pineapple fried rice and the tofu yellow curry.  The fried rice was delicious but could not see or taste any pineapple in it so that was different. As for the tofu yellow curry, I LOVE curries!!! This one was a touch spicy for me (it is mild but tasted more like medium to me), it had a lot of veggies and tofu and was so aromatic and delicious although personally I prefer a bit sweeter. We did not have room for dessert though. Our server was excellent and attentive despite being very busy with his other guests, he was always available to us. Thank goodness, I was hoping to have a good experience here and overall we did. I don't know if I'd make a special trip out here again but if you are in the area definitely give them a try. Very good food indeed.",

The lengthy layout and projected anime on the walls gave the place a modern informal vibe. Being able to arrive early enough to take advantage of happy hour prices was a plus for this visit.

There is a very long bar on one side, a long row of raised booths in the middle and then tables on the opposite side.  There were about 20 guests there when we arrived.  The menu was a little bit confusing at first.  Interesting that tea (i.e. the kind that the server brings to your table in a pitcher to refill you glass) is not offered - only bottled Republic Ice Tea at $4.00 per bottle.  My friend had hot tea which was loose-leaf and delicious - $4.00.    Appetizers ordered were the Port Pot Stickers (5 for $6.98) and the Saigon Egg Rolls (8 for $7.98).  The pot sticker were delicious!  Crispy without being greasy.  The egg rolls were blah!  Small - think of the little smoke sausages that you eat with tooth pics at parties and then smaller.  Overcooked - almost burnt and just no taste.    I ordered the Spicy Basil with chicken entree - $11.98  It was a good size portion with lots of veggies and chicken; very delicious.  My friend ordered the Yellow Curry with extra veggies - $13.98.  It looked great but was almost too spicy hot to eat (and he likes spicy foods).    Service was o.k.  Nothing horrible but nothing great either.  Marissa was our server.  She was pleasant but there was really no customer service engagement...just going through the motions.",

Okay, so I wrote the review as seen below before I went back for a second visit yesterday only to find out that my Groupon was not accepted for lunch as a lunch is a \"Special\" (as indicated on the fine print of the Groupon.  The waiter didn't inform me of that BEFORE running my Groupon through and marked it as: \"Redeemed.\"  So.....couldn't use my Groupon.....negated it COMPLETELY.  I made an issue of it and was told that the staff has had \"meetings\" concerning the Groupon/lunch acceptability.  Then WHY did he \"redeem\" my Groupon and render it useless?  Since when is a lunch menu considered a \"Special\" anyway?  Well, enough grousing about it - I have another Groupon for this place and will use it at dinner.  Here's my first review as published on TripAdvisor:  Went there on a Groupon with 2 others. We each ordered something different. I LOVE red curry so ordered that. The portion was huge (who doesn't like BIG FOOD?) The only ingredient missing, and I asked beforehand, was Thai basil. Thai basil notwithstanding, the curry was excellent and the right level of heat. Going back tomorrow for more. It IS a hip place like other reviewers mentioned but at the time we went there was just one person at the bar and one other booth filled. Before we left, though, another party of 4 came in. Doesn't matter......came here for the food.....not to people watch!!  C'est La Vie.....just want to warn anyone thinking of using their Groupon for lunch.",

No complaints at all! The spice was between 1-2 Thai hot (I love spicy food, may be too hot for others) my cocktail however wasn't terrible but wasn't on point. I still would highly recommend for others to try out this place!!! Environment was relax, dim, with a wall dedicated to inaudible anime playing.",

The happy hour is only located on the patio and at the bar, which is HUGE so I doubt seating is ever an issue. The bartenders however seemed bored and disengaged. I may have been a little over enthusiastic being my first time in... But I felt as if I was bothering him and asking \"stupid\" questions by the tone of his voice. I will definitely be back, but I'll skip the happy hour and go right to a table. I guess it's True what they say \"what you pay is what you get\".",

There didn't seem to be enough rice for the bowl of curry but I ate it like soup. I can't stress enough how superb the red curry is.  They've got the spice mix down. The service was too slow as I waiting to get back to work and the bar tender kept forgetting about me. I had to ask for a box and then the check and then the check again until finally she apologized.  I hope the service will be better next time and can't wait to try more menu items.  The happy hour at the bar only rule is bullshit.  The inside is nice especially in contrast to the run down strip mall.   Sadly, the booths are not cozy. Why have hard booths!? Makes no sense.  Nice view of the mountain out the window.",

It was super sour, it tasted EXACTLY like sinigang (Sinigang is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savoury taste most often associated with tamarind) if I wanted sinigang I would of asked my mother inlaw. I worked at a family owned Thai restaurant before the Tom yum broth was nothing near how it was suppose to taste like. I thought this was worst then a Vietnamese restaurant serving watered down chicken curry. PLEASE!!  invest in the time to perfect the Tom yum broth. It would of been more enjoyable if the broth tasted like it suppose too. Giving 2 stars for good service.",

Lots of yummy and unique flavored.  Food- so so so good! We enjoyed the sizzling green beans, edamame, tofu lemongrass soup, pad thai and the others got tons of different things and everyone kept saying they loved it all.  Atmosphere- super chic and fun.
