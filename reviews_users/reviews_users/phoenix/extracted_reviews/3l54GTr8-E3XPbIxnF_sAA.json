    "text": "First of all, the restaurant's A/C wasn't working properly since it was quite warm (even muggy.) The server welcomed us briefly and took our order a few minutes later. We waited for over 15 mins until we had to ask another server to bring our drinks and she apologized for her fellow server's mishap. While all of this was taking place we noticed our original server was having a laugh (flirting) with a fellow coworker.  The burgers weren't that good but the fries were very good, though. A tip, order the small version of the burger of your choosing since it's actually quite big. I wouldn't imagine having the large sized burger, unless I haven't eaten for a day or two.  Maybe I had bad luck with my server and the joint's temperature control, but who knows it could be business as usual at RBT. Will not be back in a while.",

Yesterday I came in a little early thinking there might be a wait considering it would be what peak happy hour is (happy hour is all day Thursday!) But instead I was sat immediately, the waitress was so nice and brought me some water while I looked over the menu for a drink. I chose their New Belgium seasonal IPA which wasn't bad for an IPA but I can feel really hit or miss on IPAS, I drank about half of it before asking for a blue moon instead - defeated by feeling adventurous. Never once did she rush when my friend was late, when it took us forever to order as we were catching up, and she was nothing but patient and accommodating the entire time - I was impressed because we definitely sat there twice as long as the other patrons. I ordered the Hawaiian barbecue burger, rare, with the tator tots. Everything was PERFECT. Burger rode the line of rare and raw but honestly I can't even complain about that because there is nothing to me more annoying than ordering a burger rare and getting it medium well at best - kudos guys! She made sure our drinks were thoroughly filled throughout the entire experience and when the check came I was shocked to see she hadn't charged me for the IPA! I was definitely planning on paying for it considering I had drank just about half but that little detail was nice and it was even nicer to see that a year between both visits no amount of customer service, quality or value was lacking. Simply impressive!",

You'll want this sauce on everything! We were lucky enough to have sat down next to one of the chefs at the bar, a super nice gentleman who suggested what I should order and I did not fail to take his advice. I got the PBJ and Bacon Burger which the menu said \"will freak your mouth out with a ridiculously delicious flavor combination\"........ the menu was right! Bacon, grape jelly, sriracha sauce and this amazing homemade peanut butter somehow combine to form a flavor nirvana. I paired this with their sweet potato tater tots which were dusted in some kind of brown sugar love. Yummers! At this point if your hangover is not fully cured, you have to try the toasted s'more milkshake made with dutch chocolate and toasted almond vodka. Next time I'm going to try the spa treated clams and the Jamaican Corn.",

Toppings were ok but they seem to try to counter their mediocrity with huge portions. Fries were underdone and just... meh.

However I stopped in yesterday to grab a to go order about 30 minutes before closing and when I say it was horrible wow it was horrible! I was so disappointed to find the pesto pasta i had ordered was a mush of over cooked noodles, chunky alfredo sauce, and a few diced tomatoes scattered about. I also came across the occasional jalapeno. Maybe was it my fault for ordering a pasta dish at a burger place? I also ordered a side cesear salad and it could not have also been more disappointing the croutons were obviously from a bag, not fresh at all, there was no parmesan on the salad and their menu described only lettuce and these disgusting stale croutons. I paid $15 for this meal and when i say it was the worst $15 i've ever spent i mean it! It's so sad for me to see a restaurant i've loved forever put out this kind of product I hope they get it together, sadly this has turned me away from the restaurant and i doubt i will be returning.",

My burger and all of its toppings were also cold like it had been sitting for 15+ minutes. The grossest part was that I ordered the burger with medium temp. It was not medium, it was practically raw with the center still being cold from the fridge (meaning it wasn't cooked through). I got food poising that night. It's a shame because I had heard so many good reviews on this place. I highly DO NOT recommend.",

The service was also great once we arrived and everyone was blown away by how much food each plate had.  I was told to try the sweet potato tots and I loved them!  They accidentally had given me fries instead, so to fix it they brought out a giant plate of the tots - very generous!  I have to say I wasn't overly wowed by my burger (I did a create-your-own), but it definitely was delicious.  My co-worker ordered the mac 'n cheese burger; I got to try it and I loved the little bit of sriracha spice it had.  That thing was overflowing with mac 'n cheese everywhere; it was quite the sight to see! Loved the atmosphere there with its fun vibes.  Definitely recommend!",

Luckily in the desert there was this funny little place with super great service and a menu filled with creative options.  Usually my husband is pretty apprehensive about trying new, weird food combos but we were on vacation so I think he was feeling adventurous - we got the bacon peanut butter & jelly one and the spicy Mac and cheese one with sweet potato tatter tots and whoaaaaa we were not disappointed!  Please note: This is NOT DATE FOOD!   It's as messy as it is delicious and it really takes commitment to a FULL BITE each time in order to get the fully balance of the flavors. The portions are huge too!  The menu was put together with much  creativity and the staff was really passionate about being welcoming and kind. We sat at the bar and noticed several regulars they called by name - a good sign of a good place.  Highly recommended!",

The staff of Rehab quickly moved everyone inside and shut the doors to keep the offending noise and smells out.

Our waitress was amazing! She was so friendly and helpful, as this was our first time. We didn't get appetizers because we knew some awesomeness was on its way.  I chose a bacon cheeseburger with onion rings, hubby got the pbj burger with fries, MIL got the ghost burger with sweet potato fries and her boyfriend got the bigger beefstro burger with the corn on the cob. All of the sides and burgers were so good!! We saved room for the pot brownies with ice cream. Omg. Best dessert ever! Everything came at a decent time and everything was wonderful and relaxing. We will definitely be back to try new things!",

The hostess was great about getting a table cleaned off for us quickly though.  We were seated and immediately greeted by a friendly server.  We ordered the Corona Ritas because why not!  There were great.  My son had the wings and mixed 2 sauces on our server's recommendation.  He LOVED them.  My daughter had a plain burger and I had the Hatch Chili Burger.  The burgers were so good!  The meat is very favorable and tender.  Fries were good but not the best I've ever had.  Love the vibe of the restaurant too.  We almost went back while we were in town but didn't want to be lame.  Ha!  Wish we had though.",

I found this place incredibly disappointing and I really wanted to like it.  I went there based on the yelp reviews and was really looking forward to it.  I ordered the patty melt which clearly wasn't a good choice.  I like to think of myself as a bit of a patty melt expert, it is probably my favorite cheat meal. This one was not worth the cheat.... a patty melt is supposed to be on \"grilled rye\" the bread was not grilled at all, it was simply dry lightly toasted marble rye, so disappointing, I pulled the burger off of the bread, no use in wasting carb intake on dry bread.  The burger itself was ok at best, I've had better at Denny's and that's pretty sad. The staff seemed friendly but not very accommodating, I don't like over anxious servers but maybe a check in occasionally would have been nice... bottom line, would I go back? Not a chance.",

    "text": "09/26/12  3.5 stars.  For my second visit, I brought Mom, her two sisters, and a cousin along to take advantage of a Yelp deal I bought for Mom.  We couldn't sit at the community table we had enjoyed before, since it was reserved for another party, but we were able to get a five-top by getting two tables next to each other.  The weather was much cooler than on our first visit, so we were comfortable in that aspect; However, the music, which had gone from tropical/surfing sounds to loud contemporary/rap/rock music, so a few of us (at least an aunt and me) were annoyed.  Rehab now offers Four Peaks' Peach ale on tap!  Sheryl (sp?), our friendly and energetic server, informed me that the bar began to serve it this past Saturday-- hurray!!  I'm so happy this has come to pass, since I've only seen this peach ale offered at three other bars/restaurants BESIDES Four Peaks: Tempe's Lucky Break (during a Yelp event held there), Vincitorio's, and Mac's Grill and Bar.  Rehab offers $3 draughts during happy hour!  Be wary of their happy hour food menu pricing though, as they're only $1 off apps...  Since Mom and I had just eaten brunch right before our massage session, we weren't hungry, but I had planned on at least enjoying a half-pint of peach ale or a little bit of wine while my aunts and cousin enjoyed their burgers.  We decided to order the app Sheryl suggested, the Pigs' wings ($9/HH) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA?select=KZrg3VgZMoHE0xJgASMR8Q#KZrg3VgZMoHE0xJgASMR8Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54...</a>, her favorite, which comes with a peach-habanero BBQ sauce made in-house.  An aunt spied calamari ($6.50/HH) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA?select=Ewn0r0HcfU9xW_7-481BgQ#Ewn0r0HcfU9xW_7-481BgQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54...</a> on the menu, and since that is also Mom's favorite app, I asked Sheryl to bring some for the table, as well.  Mom and her two sisters decided to split two Rehab-sized burgers (mushroom and swiss, $11, and green chile hatch, $10.50) and their sides of fries and sweet po\"tot\"oes.  My young cousin thought she was ordering a sandwich when she went for the Chile Con Fritos ($8).  Since I had been disappointed with the chocolate milkshake sample we were given on our first visit, I decided I'd take up Ken's offer to try one of their alcoholic versions on this visit.  Ken was absent, however, so I asked bartender John what my options were, and we decided on a vanilla-based liqueur, Frangelico, and Kahlua concoction ($8).   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA?select=hP3IwyweWGHoAHexT4OhHw#hP3IwyweWGHoAHexT4OhHw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54...</a>  My aunts enjoyed the calamari!  The pigs' wings were also good-- I enjoyed the outer crispiness and the sweet spiciness of the sauce.  I don't think I'd order it again, though, and the same goes for the calamari, which weren't as crispy as I like them to be, plus I wasn't wowed by the \"original marinara.\"  Personally, I'd just concentrate on the burgers.  I waited too long on trying the fries (as I mentioned, I wasn't hungry, and I concentrated on enjoying the sips of peach ale and the milkshake), for they were already soggy.  My aunt had sliced a portion of the hatch green chile burger for me to have, enough for two or three bites, and I still found it very tasty, even though I'd forgotten to add some chipotle aioli.  I don't think cousin enjoyed her Chile con Fritos, which didn't look very appetizing to me (and corn-based Fritos isn't something I can eat any longer) and she, the aunts, and my Mom didn't find the kitchen's idea of using a Fritos bag instead of an aluminum sheet to line the platter amusing.  I thought it showed Rehab's playful side, but you can't please everyone.  Come to think of it, I don't think it's wise to use a bag with so much ink as a liner when food's involved.  Hmm...  Last, but not least, the milkshake, which was much thicker, and that's a very good thing!  I enjoyed the first few sips, but the sweetness started to get too cloying by the mid-mark, and that's with all of us sampling.  I would only order this if I could share it with one or more people, and if I were to crave for alcoholic ice cream, I'll just head over to Lee's Cream Liquors!  :))  Props again to the management/owners on stocking up on Four Peaks Peach ale.  It's nice to patronize local bars/eateries local-based beverages and food!",

It's one of those things that you loved while in the moment but wouldn't try again, like Mardi Gras, lol.

I didn't even finish it. The fries were meh. My friend said his burger was ok but not the greatest chili burger he's had. I think this place really hopes you will down a couple of their tequila shooters from their extensive list so that you won't know how awful the burgers really are.

The calamari was fishy smelling, overly breaded, and really fatty and greasy. The Popper burger was under seasoned and just lacked something. The mushroom and Swiss burger also lacked seasoning. It also didn't even have mayo or some kind of condiment on the bun. Just a dry, naked bun. The sweet potato tots and fries were great.   The staff was friendly and attentive, however. One note I would love for the restaurant to see is that it would be great to have a small place with benches or seats outside for people to wait. I have some physical limitations and sitting on a curb or standing for 30 min for a table is too long.",

Sadly I didn't not imbibe in their mixed drink selection as I can only tell by the fare they'd be luscious as well.  I forget my Waitress' name but she had this attitude and spunk that was perfect and was packed with tips when asked.  That tells me she at least had eaten something there.  So there's two way about stopping your colon, the 10 oz or the 5 oz.  I went the 10oz route with the Porkster and Tots.  Well everyone got the tots.  My Step-Dad got the Ghost, and girlfriend the Mac and Cheese...oh that mac and cheese was delish, like word.  Maybe I'll just sneak back around and get some of that sometime.  I had been waiting to come here after a long workout and am glad I did so this day.  That Porkster was delicious, 10oz of prime ground juicy beef with cheddar and 8 oz of luscious pulled pork all on a pretzel bun.  Just nom.  Can't go wrong here.",

    "text": "This does not happen often that I completely disagree with the rating of the \"masses\" but I really struggled to see what's so great about this spot. I have been in the past to a number of spots specializing in throwing literally anything on a burger (peanut butter, chocolate, sardines, etc) and attracting a crowd just because of that. My genuine impression of Rehab was no different.  The decor is junk yard meets a restaurant, but has some recurring themes to it and tries to be badass with the bikes and all. It reminded me a bit of the theme at the Vortex in Atlanta, just not satanic. Stuff like that does not get me excited, but perhaps some people enjoy it. I'll just skip that and go straight to the one darn thing that matters, the food.  Onion Rings were mediocre, but huge. The Fish burger was quite disappointing, the fish itself was tasteless, but the burger was huge. So just picture getting something huge that you aren't really excited about eating. I've had better ingredient quality at airport restaurants. The pretzel bun was kind of cool and the only reason I'd give this spot more than 2 stars. I presume the idea is to eat this thing like an animal, as there was literally no way to fit it in the mouth. I was fine with that. My coworker had one of the beef burgers and was also rather disappointed by the meat quality. If you do come here, I'd suggest doing it more for a beer instead of food. If you want a damn good burger, hit up Relish Bistro at the Phoenician.",

We often come here when we bike to Old Town Scottsdale, especially for spring training games and general #barcycle rides.  Tonight, I had the Bacon and Blue. The burger has the blue cheese and bacon embedded in it. Does make it a little less messy while eating. I had the kaiser wheat bun. Everything was delicious. I ordered the burger medium rare and it was spot-on. The flavors were amazing. Because, umm, cheese and bacon and beef. Also, try the spicy ketchup. Yum.   Love their fries with the skin on. Beer was cold. There was oxygen in the room because we didn't pass out. This is a great little place right off Scottsdale Rd. Highly recommended.",

During that span of time, our waitress never once asked us how we were doing, um, not like she had to walk very far since she was right behind the bar. When the guys next to us received their meal before us, after sitting down well after we got there, we then inquired about our meal. Our waitress then came back and said \"oh, sorry, I forgot to put the order in\". Was so not contrite about it, she had the attitude, like \"oh, well\". We couldn't wait another 25 mins for her to be bothered w putting our order in. It's about the customer and treating them well. It's not rocket science. Jeez.",

    "text": "We arrived at rehab burger on a Sunday afternoon in late July- thought it would be not be crowded, but pretty much every table was taken.  We got seated right away, and the waitress came over pretty quickly.  We asked for water and some time to kook at the menu.  Took a few minutes, but got the water.  My husband ordered the hatch chile medium well with fries and I ordered the byob with mustard and pickles and onion ringsI ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered a beer.  After a long time -10 minutes or so the waitress came back with a beer and a mixed drink- said no that's not mine and she asked could I repeat my drink order.  I did and about 5 minutes later it arrived.  And then we waited, and waited and waited.  Finally the food arrived.  Hatch burger medium RARE (not well) with sweet potato tots not regular fries.  No ketchup; aioli instead.  My hamburger arrived with lettuce, tomato, onion, mushroom and pickles, no mustard in sight.  I took it all off and asked the hostess for mustard - which she delivered quickly.  I was also given fries instead of onion rings because according to the waitress they were \"still in the fryer,\" and would come out later.  By the time the rings came out I was full and didn't want them.  We then asked the waitress to change our tab due to the problems and she said she would send the manager over.  Well she didn't and we had to ask the hostess to send the manager over.  The manager came over quickly (guess the waitress didn't tell her) and was very sympathetic and accommodating.  She comped the whole bill, even though we were willing to pay for drinks and things that had gone ok.  I think the waitress was the problem here, not the food or the management, but it was hard to know since we didn't eat much.",

Funky music and decor, as well as GREAT service with smile, round out your night!  Open late, makes it a convenient stop for apres anything!  Make sure you share a home made brownie for dessert.

    "text": "Burgers were absolutely delish and were definitely worth 5 stars, but unorganized service caused me to take away 1 star. The place has a very casual, beachy look and feel to it, quite nice! There are two choices in sizes for the burgers 1: the Rehab which is 10 oz of angus beef. 2: the Relapse which is 5 oz of angus beef. But for only a couple dollars more, my husband and I decided to go \"Rahab\" for our burgers and take home leftovers. Well when our burgers came, mine was noticeably smaller than his and I asked the waitress. She said yes that what I received was a \"relapse\" and that she would go check the computer to see what size I had ordered even though I told her  .  I had ordered the \"rehab\". When she came back, she said that the smaller size was what was written down but that she will go and have them make me a Rehab. That was fine with me, I don't usually get upset easily. But she took away the wrong size burger so I was left staring at my husband eating his gigantic chile cheeseburger and nibbled on his yummy tater tots and my onion rings that came with the burgers. 15 minutes go by and another waiter comes by and asks if we would like boxes to take home leftovers! I told him that I have not received my burger yet due to a miscommunication. He apologized and said that he would bring my burger out as soon as he sees that it's ready. 10 more minutes go by and I my burger comes out, but by then I was not hungry anymore and my husband was done eating. So I took a bite just to taste it and to appreciate the freshness. It was so delicious!  Then our waitress came by and I asked for a box. She took a look at my almost untouched burger and actually said \"Stuffed huh?\" I just smiled cause it was actually quite funny how she didn't even acknowledge that my appetite and dinner were kind of ruined because of her mistake. I understand that that mistake easily happened because the place was packed and the music was loud and that \"Rahab and Ralapse\" can sound the same. I just wished they had tried a bit harder to make up for the mistake. Perhaps they could have left me the first burger to eat at the same time as my husband and let me take home the one I ordered? Or maybe discount my check? Idk...but we did think the burgers, tots, and onion rings were delicious and the prices are great.",

    "text": "My rating is more of 3.5 than a full 4 but oh well, its still good. Rehab Burger Therapy is maybe one of the worst names for a restaurant I've heard but still it didn't stop me from going in. Decor has no relation to name. Surfer looking joint. Which is fine. Menu doesn't relate to either concept, surfing or Rehab other than the sizing of the burger being \"Rehab\" for bigger and \"Relapse\" for the smaller.  Walked in on a February afternoon, restaurant is a bit on the warmer side, air's a little thick. Maybe just the day but still not perfect setting. Who cares about setting really, lets talk about the food. First of all the main reason I leaned to the 4 instead of 3 stars is mainly due to the waitress being pretty cute. That's a plus in my book. We started out with the calamari which was a great choice. Really good. They gave a really generous portion and we devoured it right away. Waitress brought us 3 different dipping sauces not sure if thats the norm, one was medium buffalo sauce that they put on the wings which she said \"one of my favorites\", 2nd was a chipotle something another, and the 3rd was the marinara that they give normally. All were fantastic! The buffalo sauce worked really well with the batter on the calamari and the other two were equally great. Like i said, we devoured it. Great start. We ordered beers, decent prices but not as chilled as they should've been. The three of us ordered all burgers, one had pulled pork on the burger but we were told they didn't have any pulled pork. Not good. We eventually ordered the bbq burger, chili cheese burger and the whatever the name was that had grilled pineapple, cheese and ham on this burger. BBQ burger went over really well. Pineapple ham burger also went over splendidly. My chili burger not quiet as good. The chili is good, would've been better as a side dish then on the burger. The whole plate when brought out was covered in chili. The bottom of my pretzel bun couldn't be found as it turned to mush from sitting in chili. Not good. The burgers are large but could use some kind of seasoning, a little on the bland side. Pretzel bun was ok, I've had better. You can buy better at Costco. Maybe they should do a daily run over there every day instead. The fries sucked. Barely ate any. The sweet potato tots were ok at best. Their sides need work for sure. Service even though she's pretty she was not the most prompt and kinda didn't show up for a while even though business was rather slow at this time. So there is some negatives but there was more positives so therefore a positive rating. I like the place but it does have room to improve. Hopefully if there is a next time, and it will be.",

One of the things I like to do is eat at local places that are recommended by local people. (They always know best!) So on Friday evening, they brought me to Rehab Burger Therapy.  I must admit, the name had me just a little worried. But my friends said \"You WILL love this place!\"  I am SO GLAD they brought me here. The atmosphere is exactly what I like about these local places. You could tell the people were locals who came often - because it was good! This isn't a fancy, overpriced restaurant. It's a great local establishment that is obviously busy for a reason! Even though it was busy, the service was friendly and attentive. The burgers are SUPER! I also enjoyed the sweet potatoes - heck, everything was good. If someone from the business reads these, THANK YOU! Next year when I visit again, I WILL BE BACK! After we left, I told my friends that we have to come back next year and they said they go there all the time. I'm going to recommend some Burger Therapy to anyone I know who is heading out west to Scottsdale! Thank you again!",

The staff could tell we had not been there before, so our waitress took it upon herself to tell us everything there was to know.  It was wonderful to be welcomed that way.  We got our food quickly and she even brought over different sauces for our fries/ sweet tater tots that were far beyond the usual ketchup.  The sweet tater tots with pineapple sauce was to die for! Salty and sweet and it hits your tongue just right. (I don't even like pineapple and I ate it up!) The chipotle ranch is amazing and not too spicy for a wimp like me.   The burgers are giant, def order the smaller size, and the pretzel bun is a MUST. We also enjoyed some of the best calamari as an appetizer with the chipotle ranch.  The atmosphere is so fun and it seemed like a vacation within a vacation for me.  I wish there was one close to where I live, I would be a regular.",

Well I sat down and ordered my drink planning on just staying long enough to eat and run.. Then one server sitting down the bar from me was making jewelry, Robin. She was so nice and friendly so we meet and she gave me 2 bracelets made while I was waiting on my food and had an awesome belt she made that I bought right there!! Be sure and ask for her if you like cool and vintage inspired accessories;) she's awesome! So after I meet her I am introduced to almost everyone working tonight, which I think is really cool and makes the visit much more fun;). I met Jon, who was so nice and welcoming also, I believe he is either the owner or manager, and my server was a super cool chick named Chi Chi I believe, at least that's what my recipt said!! She helped me choose what to order and I got the Relapse or smaller version of the build your own burger with sweet potato tots!;) AMAZING! One of the best burgers I've ever had, not too big, perfect for me and those who like a thinner, smaller burger! You can get big ones too! That's the awesome thing about this place, each and every sandwich can be made as the smaller version for us light eaters or huge for those wanting more! Great idea! I hate it when I get a huge thick burger and it's falling off the bun and just feels like trying to eat a brick... Not here! You choose between 3 buns, pretzel, wheat, and I believe brioche.... Wheat was perfection! I loved the peach margarita that my bar tender made, and we talked a bit and later she brings me a glass of what looks like a milkshake with whipped cream on top and says to try this and tell her if I like it... I was a little nervous because that can either go really wrong or really right, but it was great and sweet of her to bring me free desert;). It turned out to be a Fireball milkshake!!! I hate Fireball but this was really good! It was really nice to meet so many of the staff, and they were so nice and said I need to be a regular since I live walking distance away:) I think I will do just that! My favorite place in Scottsdale for sure so far!!",

Our waiter brought out aioli for me without me asking because he said he thought I might like it and then brought me a lid in case I wanted to take some home with me for my left-overs.  Amazing!  It was great service and it was obvious that the people there loved their jobs.  We will definitely be going back there and I will be bringing friends.",

The burgers are cooked to order so I got a medium rare cheeseburger just the way I like it.  I opted for a pretzel bun which was crispy on the outside and soft inside.  The onion rings were really king size with a tasty batter.  Service was as good as one could expect given most all the tables were filled.  No complaints.  The decor is sort of California surfer which is kind of weird in the middle of the desert but I guess it works.  We ate inside but Rehab has a nice outdoor patio.  Would definitely come back again.",

Best part....they have the option of a pretzel bun for all their burgers!! I can't wait to bring my husband back to try another burger and enjoy the relaxed, cool atmosphere! I live completely the other side of the valley from Scottsdale, but I think this will become a regular spot for me! It's just that good.  Oh, and the bathrooms were way cool too.

Tried: skin on fries - GOOD  Shelby's Spinach Salad - huge, beautiful and GOOD  Hatch Chili burger on Gluten Free Bun- He was in HEAVEN  Sweet Potato Tater Tots- SERIOUSLY AMAZING.  I don't even care for sweet potato french fries but something about this being mashed up in the middle and crunchy on the outside with salt.  I can't wait to have them again.  Pineapple Teriyaki Aoli - SERIOUSLY AMAZING 2.  I am slightly allergic to pineapple and don't like mayo at all so I almost never like aoli.  This dip with the tots is the bomb.    Ketchup - what's there to say?  Spicy Ketchup - okay.  what you would expect.  Chipotle Ranch - My second favorite dip.  Chocolate Lava milkshake with a shot of Bailey's - YUMMMM  They had run out of pot brownies by the time we wanted dessert and that made me really sad.  I guess it gives us a reason to return soon though.",

    "text": "Food (4 stars): After consuming so much food since we are on vacation, I wanted something on the lighter side, so I opt in for the Shelby's Shpinach Shalad. It is a spinach salad topped with walnuts and blue cheese and drizzled with a sweet/tangy strawberry vinaigrette dressing. My fiancee got the Chili Cheese Rehab burger. Note: the rehab burger is burger than the relapse burger. The chili cheese burger was not bad, however, I still prefer chili cheese burger from Tommy's in Los Angeles, CA just because there was nothing spectacular about the burger from this restaurant. We substitute the fries for the sweet poTOToes. The sweet poTOToes were a little under cooked so the outer shell of the tots were not crispy and the inside was soggy.   Sauces: We tried Pineapple Teryaki Aioli, Chipotle Aioli, Chipotle Ranch, and Pesto Aioli. We were not a fan of the pineapple teryaki aioli since it was too sweet but if you are looking for something interesting to try then this sauce would be it! The sauce we liked the best was the chipotle ranch.   Service (4 stars): The server checked on us every so often to see how we were doing.   Ambiance (4 stars): There is in and outdoor sitting area on high bench chairs with umbrellas to provide shade. This is a chill place for those who are looking for a place to hang out after work or on the weekends. There is a parking lot next door.   Overall, I would come back for the salad and to try the other burgers.",

    "text": "Came here based on a recommendation from one of our favorite Pattie's bartenders and boy was he right.  First, my biggest problem with Burgers today - a half pound burger should not be your standard size!!! When I was 10, the half pound burger was a novelty item for pigs to order and bring half of it home . Now places just assume \"oh, they want a hamburger? They must want to cry from how full they are...\"   Now back to Rehab - sure, they have the ten ounce patty for soft suicide, but they also have the reasonable, tasty, cooked perfectly 5 ouncer, or 1/3 pound burger that most people remember. It was cooked right, juicy and not bland. I liked it so much, I went there twice during my vacation, and everything was fantastic - the fries are fresh, and shocker - taste amazing with the skin still on them. All their sauces are home made, and their wings are great. Then the burgers - I got pretty similar ones, the second day getting what I call the breakfast burger - with Bacon and a fried egg - combine that with the pretzel roll, and it was most likely the BEST one of those I've ever had!   My friend had some fish tacos that looked screaming and I think he almost lost a finger when eating them.   I never had a Scottsdale burger place I had to stop by - I had pizza (Grimaldi's) Italian(the Italian Grotto) Sandos (Defalcos) and steak (Don and Charlies)... Looks like I now have my burger joint!   Service: 4 stars Atmosphere 5 stars (cool servers, awesome laid back music, outside couches) Food 5 stars (All Good - Burgers, Wings, Fries and Fish Tacos!) Price 5 stars",

Happy hour savings aren't exactly great.  $1 off an appetizer?  Thanks for covering the tax, I guess?  Decor is sort of a beachy stoner motif?  Um...cool?  There's a magazine rack between the stalls in the ladies room?  Um...awesome?   Food was good, though I only shared some appetizers (fries, tots).  These came with an amusing (and awesome) amount of interesting condiments, which I enjoyed, considering my fridge is 2/3 full of dressings and sauces instead of actual foods. The \"small\" burgers are ginourmous, so that's probably why they don't have such good happy hour food discounts (they can't be making a ton of money on these).  Where this place shines is the service (surprisingly good), beer selection and the music.  Could've sworn they tapped into my iTunes...  I'll probably be back sometime, if friends want to go here.",

The salad was also top notch.  It was crowded so we had to sit at the bar - but that ended up being OK.  The burger was perfectly cooked (medium) and loaded with cream cheese.  Melted cheddar on top of that.  Deep fried jalapenos on top of that.  It was loaded and luscious.    The salad was huge - plenty of strawberries, goat cheese and pecans.  I wish I lived in Scottsdale because I would definitely return.",

I was a little skeptical of how this was going to be but with the umami of the beef and bacon and the sweetness of the peanut butter and jelly it was such a surprisingly amazing combo. The only thing I wish they had done was have a better separation between the peanut butter and the pickle. Not my favorite combo in the world.  The hatch burger with a turkey patty was also a great combo.  Try the home made mustard!",

My brother and I sat at the bar, ordered beers right away, got menus then were ignored for 20 minutes. I tried to get someone's attention behind the bar but I guess they didn't hear me. The bartender finally stood right in front of us and I said we were ready to order whenever he was. He looked at us with no expression and after a few seconds he said ok as soon as I serve these beers and he walked away. Not sure what these employees think, but there are lots of other places to spend my money with better attitudes.  We went next door. Had great service. Spent our money there. Now I realize that the $45 Rehab didn't get from us won't put them out of business but if enough patrons are treated like this it will eventually make a difference.  We won't be back.",

    "text": "Wow, I am really sorry that I waited so long to try this place. And really, the only reason I did was because I had a groupon (Amazon Local, actually). It was a deal for couples where you get to share one appetizer and then you each get a burger and then share a dessert. Wow, that was a lot of food! We ended up taking most of it home because their burgers are huge. I ordered their special for the night which had sirracha, peanut butter, jelly, and bacon on it. I know it sounds a little crazy but it was incredibly good. And I loved the pretzel bun; a lot of burger places try to do a pretzel bun but are unsuccessful at it. All the burgers on the menu had a lot of interesting toppings and most of them sounded pretty good. The best part for me was the sweet potato tater tots. Those were fantastic! We also ordered wings which hubby said were pretty good (I didn't try any). And for dessert they were out of the pot brownies so we got a strawberry milkshake which tasted like it was made with fresh fruit. Mmmm good!!  I really liked the laid back island vibe of this place. They had a lot of surfer and beach paraphernalia decorating the walls. It was fun without being too corny. And I really liked the music, too. Some surf and some rock. While we were there they played a lot of Sublime which always puts a smile on my face since it takes me back to my college days. Everyone seemed really friendly and our waiter was awesome!  I definitely will return. I wish I had found out about this place while I was still working in Old Town!",

Themed like a Hawaiian dive, it is anything but. The staff was friendly, the music was always reggae, and the air conditioning was a kiss compared to the dry, desert heat outside.  I had the Know Poblano burger (small) with sweet poTOToes, caramel milkshake on the side. Delicious all around. The owner gave me some 1:1 service, suggesting the spicy ketchup, coming out also with a teriyaki dip as well. I can only recommend this place and will definitely be coming back next time I'm in AZ.",

In my opinion is an improvement from the first ones I tried in Orlando. So, needless to say, I'm hooked. So much so that I have had them for lunch more times than I would like to admit.  The service was great. The place gets busy so be sure to keep that in mind during lunch or dinner times on the weekends. The menu is extensive and they offer beyond the burgers and wings mentioned. It is for sure a spot that anyone can find something on the menu to sample. Check it out.",

I was a bit adventurous and got the PBJ Bacon Burger and it was awesome! Great service, great food - we'll definitely be coming back.",

I ordered the 10 oz bacon bleu burger on the pretzel bun and it was huge! I got the onion rings and they are amazing compared to other places. I also tried the fries with the spicy ketchup which our server told us is based in habanero and it had the perfect amount of kick. If you want a good burger, give Rehab Burger a chance. By the way, never go into other places named rehab because A. Quitting is for wussies and B. The food isnt as tasty!",

However, the sweet potato tots were TO DIE FOR (I found myself craving them weeks later) and the burger was really good. I will definitely be back to try the PBJ & Bacon Burger that everyone has raved about, but the slow service could absolutely use some improvement.",

Figured that was a good sign of how tasty the food was so I ordered a Hawaiian burger (rehab size) to go with a side of sweet potato tots. I wandered around town until it was ready, about 20 minutes later. Took the burger back to my hotel. It was HUGE. I'm embarrassed to say I ate the entire thing in one sitting. Super juicy, and the aioli on the side was amazing. The tots were a bit soggy...was like eating fried mush. Also, this experience cost me somewhere around $12-14. A little spendy. But, it was an awesome, juicy burger. Would do a relapse size next time.",

I really like the chipotle ranch and chipotle aioli.  I've tried just about all the burgers and my top two by far are the Bistro Burger and the siracha peanut butter burger .  If you're on the fence about ordering a peanut butter burger or maybe you've had one in the past and didn't care for it , pull the trigger on this one . The flavors are excellent and it will change your whole perspective on what you thought a burger should taste like . Service is always great and they always have good happy hour specials. If you're in town and looking for a great burger you have to check this place out . You won't regret it . Just make sure you don't order the rehab size burger if you plan on going out drinking and walking around . Rehab size will put you in a good coma and you'll be in Netflix and  Pajamas mode in a hurry . Not that it's a bad thing ...",

The decor inside is cute... definitely surfer/California vibe.  I like it.  It was a bit hot inside... could have used the AC turned down a notch or two.  Service was great... our waitress offered her recommendations and was very friendly/helpful.  The burgers were great... messy, but great.  I had a standard cheese burger with thousand dressing (I don't remember what it was called).  It was fab... everything you'd want in a burger.  The Hubs had a burger with pulled pork on top.  He ate every bite and was in 7th heaven.  Both of us felt our sides were pretty cold... fries for me and tots for him.  They would have been much better hot, but they were still pretty good.  We were able to get some beers on happy hour, which was great.  We will surely hit this place up again.  Next time, I want to try that pot brownie... sounded delish.",

The hamburger was very good, but I probably wouldn't call it great. Mine was a little over cooked and therefore a little dryer than I like. I didn't go with the fries, so I can't comment on them. Instead I went with the onion rings and they were also very good. I look forward to going back and trying some of the other items on the menu.",

While I am not a red meat eater, the menu caters to all types.  Veggie burgers,  chicken burgers,  chorizo burgers and of course good old fashioned beef burgers.   I had a turkey Hawaiian burger on a pretzel bun with Jamaican corn.  They were simply incredible and complimented each other perfectly.   My wife had the turkey bacon cheeseburger with onion rings.  The onion rings were huge and flavorful.   Our server CW was prompt, efficient and helpful.   When we were done,  we all agreed it would be worth the 30 minute v drive to go there again.",

We got the pb&j burger and I really forgot the second one.. he said it was like a big mac.    Pb&j- SO good, gotta say it has super umami flavoring.  Has to be the peanut butter and shiracha.  A warning though it can get overwhelming so I would share this.   Big mac?-  Nothing special just a burger with lots of toppings and overwhelming sauce.  So I guess not knowing the name of it isn't that bad.    It can get crowded so I'd come early if you dont want to wait.  I remember these people right behind me and up in my personal bubble.. felt so weird. But I guess the awesome burger made up for it",

I start off with the fried calamari, which were cooked to absolute perfection, not a soggy piece among them, a whole meal's worth by themselves. For my main course, the Hatch Chile Cheeseburger with a turkey substitute and the pretzel bun, and an overabundance of sweet potato tots with a chipotle aoli sauce to dip them in. I am in food heaven here. THe chiles gave the burger such a good amount of heat and the flavor...intense.   My companion and I then split one of the Pot Brownies, reese's style, cuz you gotta have peanut butter with chocolate to cut that much chocolate. I'm not sure if it's because the dessert was thought up by a pot head or because of the cast iron EasyBake pot it comes in but this darkened brick of brown love is delivered, swimming in a lake of what I soon discover is mallow creme, and topped with (you have to mention you want it or you'll sadly go without) two scoops of vanilla ice cream. It's not a dessert for the faint of heart or with diabetes, because if you don't already have to take regular insulin injections you probably will after consuming it.  Whether stoned, high, drunk, or just come down with a super case of the munchies, this little gem in SoSco will hit all your right buttons.",

What a cute place! It reminded me of a place I bar-tended at in Florida! Very relaxed, reggae on the speakers...awesome! Our waitress was the best! I didn't get her name (and I meant to!) but she was knowledgeable, entertaining, and patient with us...and super fast, though we were there at around 3:30 PM in order to avoid any rush.  I ordered the Know Poblano Burger (Relapse size) on a pretzel bun with the Sweet PoTOToes...it was out of this world!! Cooked to order, in this case medium, and covered in these spicy, grilled onions and a HUGE poblano pepper!! Our waitress brought us each 2 different dipping sauces as well...Spicy Ketchup and Chipotle Aioli. Both were excellent on my Sweet PoTOToes, which are sweet potato tater tots!!  My bestie ordered the Hatch Chile Cheeseburger (Rehab size) on a pretzel bun with the skin on, homemade/cut fries. He LOVED his burger so much I think he bgan a serious relationship with it!!  For dessert (we really ARE pigs!) we shared a Pot Brownie...O...M...G...!!! Two brownies with marshmallow cream in between, baked, and coated with Hershey's Sauce!! It could not have gotten any better!!  This place is a gem! We adored EVERY minute of our time there and we will most definitely be back...as many times as our waist sizes allow!!",

There is parking along downtown: there's a parking lot right next to the restaurant (with underground parking) and there's also three hour parking along the streets.  They have happy hour 11am-6pm daily and all day Thursday. You can check in and get chips and salsa for $3.99.  PIG WINGS ($11.50) - They give about 8 pig wings per order. I really enjoyed the tenderness of the wing along with the sweetness and spiciness of the sauce. It was literally fall off the bone which is always a good sign. 4/5  SPICY MAC-N-CHEESE BURGER ($15.50, REHAB) - There are two different sizes of burger patties: 10oz Rehab and 5oz Relapse. We got the rehab because we were splitting the burger. I expected the burger to be spicier than it was given that spicy is in the name of the burger. The mac n cheese didn't have as much cheesiness or just taste in general. There were a couple jalapenos but even those weren't really spicy. 3.5/5  SWEET POTOTOES - We ordered these alongside our burger and oh my goodness these are so addicting. I could eat these for days and would never get enough of them. I loved dipping them in the orange-colored sauce (don't know what it is but it was delicious together). 5/5  If you're from the SoCal area, this place reminds me a lot of PB Cantina and Cabo Cantina in terms of their decorations and drinks. Their happy hours are a lot better but Rehab has much better burgers and other foods and isn't only a place to get wasted but a family friendly place to get lunch or dinner (doesn't mean you can't get wasted here though because their margaritas are good and strong).",

TVs everywhere but some just show a fish tank and another shows a sponsored channel, very odd.   Burgers were good. They have some traditional and some funny toppings. I had a solid BBQ burger on a pretzel bun. Hit the spot. Fries were delicious but the sweet potato tater tots looked intriguing. My buddy had the PB&J Sriracha burger. He loved it but I wasn't as big a fan.   Near the main stretch of a shopping and restaurant area but not in the middle of it. There's a bit garage and parking lot nearby.",

Our female server was polite, took our drink orders quickly, BUT the stale hot air in the corner was too much to take. We dropped a $20 to our server because it was NOT her fault that the AC didn't exist. If you plan on going here, sit under a fan and it is easier to tolerate the heat. We were sooo bummed because their food looked sooo good in the pictures :(",

And a dash of sriracha sauce balanced out what could otherwise have been too sweet and a bit heavy. Mac N Cheese on the spicy Mac n cheese burger was not as salty or heavy as I expected, and it helped preserve the beef flavor of the burger patty. The combination of flavors was not extraordinary, but the burger was very well balanced and tasty.  The only downside was that the font on the menu was too small to read especially under the dim light.  Other than that, the restaurant was overall good with nice customer service and relaxing ambiance.",

I try to shy away from burgers but this seemed like a good choice. I will say it's a nice room, large and open and not to loud. Service was pretty good and I grabbed a spot at the bar. They have a good selection of beers (as all trendy burger places do) and a pretty good selection of burgers, salads and wraps (as all the burger places do).   I ordered the fried jalapenos burger and I have to say it was less than impressive. I couldn't decide on fries or sweet potato tots so I got both. Good came out quick but for the exception of the meat and the tots everything else was cold!  I don't even know how you do that?  Flavors were good (like every other burger place).   I don't know if I'd bother coming back. There are some places a few block down, but I guess in the immediate area and compared to the neighbors I may.   KT",

I saw Rehab had a really good rating, so decided to get food to go from there. I got the bigger beefstro burger and my husband got the Hawaiian burger. We thought both were ok. We didn't like the sauce that came with either burger. I ate my burger without the wasabi sauce and it was ok. I felt like it was missing something. My husband put bbq sauce on his burger instead. I felt like his burger was missing something too. I think it's expensive for what it is.",

I highly suggest requesting their chipotle aioli and smearing that on your bun...makes it pure perfection!  They also have gluten free buns for those of us whose tummies hate gluten!  When busy, it's a bit noisy inside, but a fun atmosphere.  Staff is friendly, service is pretty good, but the burgers make this a must-visit if you're anywhere near Scottsdale.",

The burgers i recommend there are the spicy Mac n Cheese burger and always choose the pretzel bun for your burgers.  The mac n cheese has a nice little sriracha kick to it which pares great with the meat of the burger.  The second burger i recommend is the PB&J burger.  Yes, i said it PB&J.  By far the best burger on the menu.  Be sure to get the sweet potato tots with the pinapple aoli.  Wow knock your socks off.  There Onion rings are massive and super crispy and the dipping sauce is a chipotle ranch which is on another level of awesomeness!  If you have room for dessert you have to get the pot brownie.  Nice warm brownie with the with the cool feel of the ice cream which is drenched in chocolate, peanut butter, and marshmallow.  You cant go wrong with the menu.  The food there is well worth the wait.  So WAIT!!!  BrandonFitFoodie",

The Beefstro my brother ordered was apparently amazing (I didn't have the chance to try it, he eats really fast!) The salsa was pretty tasty, but I would have liked some better chips.   The place has a fun atmosphere with mostly high top tables, there are plenty of TVs to watch sports, and our server was super sweet and helpful.   When you go, get the fries. I had the sweet potato fries, and they were a little too sweet for my taste, and were in the tater tot style (little pops or pieces I guess).   Oh and beer was cold. Very important. :)",

The chips has a really good seasoning with a hint of lime. The salsa was fresh, had a good bit to it, thick so it stays on the chip and satisfied that little spot that needed instant filling before our burger!   After looking at the pictures I decided that it would be best if the other person I was with and I split a burger because we didn't think we could finish one on our own! My assumption was correct. We got the PORKSTER BURGER and it was delicious!! The perfect amount of meat, you definitely get your money's worth. We got the Sweet Potato tots that are extremely addicting!! And the sauces that accompany it are very complimenting. I enjoyed the Chipotle sauce while the person I was with liked the pineapple Teriyaki best.   The service was excellent. Everyone there was happy, helpful and attentive, which was refreshing! The vibes are laid back and allow you to \"chillax\" which is written on the TV screens of floating fish.   We will definitely be back! :)",

We sat at the bar so we could watch the games while eating. Our bartender was attentive, knowledgable and friendly. They have good drinks specials. Also, they have special burgers off menu so be sure to ask about them.  I ordered the PBJ & Bacon Burger. It comes with peanut butter, grape jelly, Sriracha sauce and bacon. The burger meat its self is just ok. The toppings made the burger very good. The flavors combine extremely well together. It is a rich burger with the peanut butter, but well worth it. My only mistake was ordering the 10 ounce burger. The five ounce would have been plenty of food for me.  For my side I chose the Jamaican Corn. It is grilled and then briefly fried. It creates a very interesting texture. The flash fry hit some of the flavors. If I was to go again I would add some sauce at the end to give some of that flavor back.",

The waiter asked me if I wanted the regular size, which I thought meant the smaller size, but it was the bigger one. It was HUGE! The meat was really good and cooked well. The bread was good and didn't fall apart as I ate it. The mac and cheese on it was ok, but was a little bland. It had bacon and green chiles in it, but could have used some salt or hot sauce to flavor it. I got sweet potato tots with mine and really enjoyed them. My husbands burger was also huge, but due to all the toppings, he felt that the meat to bun ratio was not right and his sandwich was left falling apart from not enough bun to hold it all together. Both of us had enough burger left over to take home for dinner. Next time I would order a smaller burger.   The service was friendly and our waiter chatted with us and provided us with suggestions. The environment was fun. Overall it was a good experience and I would go back again, but I might try something different next time, maybe a spicier burger.",

    "text": "First time getting to try Rehab Burger Therapy. Went with this family on a Saturday afternoon and it was crowded but we were seated nearly immediately. The waitress asked if it was our first time and explained the menu to us and noticed we had kids and (since there isn't a kids menu) named some of the most ordered items for kids. She warned us that the portions were large and are usually split between children.   We ordered the Spicy Mac n Cheese burger and the Jalapeno Popper burger, as well as the Quesadilla and a grilled cheese for the kids. I opted for onion rings and we also got fries and the sweet potato tots. The burgers were delicious as were the sides. The kids were happy with their choice, it was definitely a lot of food. You can't leave this place hungry. The waitress was nice and attentive, the food was great. Definitely happy we decided to give it a try. We will be back.",

    "text": "If you eat here regularly and you eat a rehab burger (not a relapse burger) expect to gain about 20 pounds per week.  The 10-ounce rehab burger, which comes in many mouth-watering disguises, is not a burger for the meek. It starts at about 5 inches in height and, if served with a pretzel bun and a variety of added toppings, it may reach a staggering 10 inches in height. You will find it a challenge to get your mouth around it and when you do be prepared to catch the juices that slop out of the enormous concoction. You want fries with that? Of course you do, especially as they come automatically with your burger. You can have regular fries or sweet potato tots. Chips and salsa--why not. Beer-what the heck, go for broke. Enjoy this exceptional burger joint with its surfing, motor-cycling and California style decor. The waitresses are all very attentive and will serve you with a smile. There is outdoor seating but I don't recommend eating there during the summer as it will be really hot out there. This is a primo burger restaurant that knows how to serve you a man-size succulent repast. If you aren't that hungry order a relapse burger as it will only be five ounces and it will still fill you up.",

    "text": "So I needed to go try out the most ridiculous burger I could and this was the place. You know what, it is more of a kids place than not on one hand, and yet again it is not due to full bar and higher quality/prices.   So the whole party was adventurous, but I went with the PB&J burger Rehab Size w a side of onion rings. So it came in, and I have pictures, and I was impressed. Now the PB ran down the sides and invited for a messy meal, so I went for it with knife and fork as a proper European. It was good. I mean, it was interesting on a novelty level. The peanut butter was powerful, and the jelly kinda just provided a sweet tone. The burger itself was amazing and the pretzel bun was stellar. The 5 massively onion rings was a little disappointing at first, but they delivered. They were huge - in my opinion a little too big actually. I mean it looks great, but the onion becomes slightly underdone this way and provides the crunch to a thick breading. But back to the burger. This place can cook burgers for sure. It was a big meal. I was full all night on this one burger - I didn't even finish all my onion rings.   I will come back here, for the burgers alone - but then I will go for something else. PB&J burger was interesting but will never become a staple. So burger was a hit, the onion rings were not my style. Too big. Fries were good though. And everybody was happy with their burgers.    Our waitress was cute and personable. She gave her opinion on food and drinks when asked for it, which is something I really like. But besides that she was quite confused. She mixed and matched up orders on the bills, and then she lost a credit card - but found it again. Just one of those things that doesn't impress.",

    "text": "Absolutely awful!!!!. This was my third and last visit.   First two visits everything was ok. No complaints. But this afternoon 12-6-16 the burgers were overcooked and cooked unevenly. Asked for medium and got well done to rare. Must have been frozen. Had the jalapeno burger and bit into an avacodo shell. A slab of avacodo placed on the burger was not cleaned all the way and it was suppose to be quacamole. My girlfriends burger was cooked unevenly and she could not eat it. The burgers were plain garbage for place that specializes in burgers  We informed the server several times and shortly after a cook came out and began staring at us. This made my girlfriend uncomfortable.  What is more disappointing is that i am on a diet and only have a  burger every now and then. Needless to say we will find another burger place.",

    "text": "Tough week at work....had to have some rehab.....Rehab Burger that is!  Location & Aesthetics - Located on E. 2nd St. in Scottsdale which was a bit of trip for me from my usually stomping ground in the West Valley but it was worth the drive. Parking is a bit of a mystery as I couldn't figure out where I was allowed to park.  There weren't any signs where patrons was instructed to park so I just followed the crowd and parked across the street where there was a large parking lot.   The restaurant itself looks small on the outside and even the outside patio with its fans and misters was small and seemed crowded with the arrangement of the tables and chairs being in close proximity to each other.  The inside was the same - small.   Another mystery was how customers were seated.  For example, from my observations, a party of two was sometimes seated at a table with four chairs with the two other chairs being unused.  On the other hand, I noticed a party of two with a kid was seated at the long table - a long table with a slew of high chairs on either side of it, where the couple was supposed to sit opposite each other and not side-by-side. The couple with the kid had to put their kid on one of those high chairs which, in my opinion, didn't look too safe or too comfortable. The way the chairs are bunched up together at the long table, was in close proximity to each other, meaning that on a day when the place might be packed, I could envision folks sitting elbow-to-elbow at said long table which is really not comforting in my opinion!  (-1) Thankfully, when we went (on a Friday evening), there wasn't anyone sitting immediately next to us at this long table but rather a chair over from us on either side which didn't make the situation stifling.  Menus - The usual, given upon arrival and when you're seated.  Very large, self-explanatory, and easy to understand.    Service - The staff was nice, friendly, warm, welcoming, and answered any questions we had about the meals. Our waitress was prompt with introducing herself to us upon being seated, and was also prompt with the complimentary glasses of water (which tasted stale), and our drinks. Despite having folks around us and having their orders taken after our orders, we did notice that our orders came well after theirs but it wasn't unnerving.  Food - The burgers were very tasty and creative.  I like the fact the have their own names, sizes (only 2 - Rehab or Relapse), their own particular and peculiar set of ingredients which I think makes each one a unique creation and a taste unto itself. I ordered the BBQ Burger but couldn't tell if it was a Relapse size or a Rehab size as I had forgotten to mention it to the waitress but nonetheless it tasted superbly. I also like you can choose the type of bun to go along with your burger.  Unfortunately, for sides, you're only allowed fries or sweet potato tots (two dipping sauces supplied with it); the latter was very tasty.  I can see the great variety in their burger creations can possibly bring me back despite the place being small.",

(That sounds funny) Been wanting to drop in for a while but it took my daughter and her boyfriend inviting me to actually get it done and WOW was I floored. The place is my kind of joint, beachy casual environment with friendly service.  My daughter got the Hangover (love the egg), he got the Macncheese burger (insane) and I got the Elvis....Win!  All the burgers were great but we all agreed the Elvis was the hands down favorite. Double patty with PB, chocolate, and caramelized bananas.BAM!!  Pretty sure it's only served on the weekend.

Opted for a Hawaiian burger.  It was good, but they didn't bring the aoli that was supposed to come with it.  Finished 1/2 my burger before I was able to flag down the server.  (He never came by to check to make sure everything was okay.)    While waiting to flag down the server for my aoli, the table next to us received a basket of onion rings!!  I guess they decided they had enough now.  They offered to bring us some... if we paid for them.  We were almost done with our meals by that point... we declined.  No drink refills were offered.  We were without water and soft drinks throughout most of our meal.   Overall the service was very lacking...being busy is not an excuse for virtually no service whatsoever.   Even if we lived in the area, we would not return.  Very disappointing.",

We watched all the burgers being served while waiting and got pretty excited for what was in store for us.  While waiting to be seated, we noticed a long table in the middle of the room.  There were roughly 8-10 empty seats at this table.  So we were naturally wondering why we weren't being seated at this table.    There was also another couple standing next to us that had finished their meal and waiting inside.  They had commented that it was just too hot outside to wait to pay for the bill.  And the waitress was taking too long to bring their bill.  The hostess let us know our table was now ready (about 10min wait) and seated us.  So we sat down and started going over the drink menu first.  We needed to cool down!  Once our drink order was placed, we couldn't help but notice how hot it was inside the restaurant.  At first, we thought because it was a hot day and we were waiting by the front door.  But now that we were seated, it was just plain hot.  After carefully mulling over the menu, we decided on two burgers... one Turkey burger and one Spicy Mac N Cheese burger.  Both with the sweet potato tater tots.  While waiting for the food, we loved the vibe in the place.  The cool beachy decor, and 90's jammin tunes... all made for a neat chill space to hang in.  The burgers arrived in good time and looked fantastic!  The tots... perfection!  Though, I think it would be nice if they offered the various sauces in a sampler setup, to dip the tots.  Ketchup was the only sauce brought out.  The mac n cheese burger was great.  The trick is to eat all the mac n cheese first.  It's almost like an extra side meal in itself.  The lil hits of Sriracha were a great flavor adder.  The turkey burger was HUGE.  It was fresh n juicy.  Too many places serve something small and dry.  Rehab does a great job avoiding that pitfall.  So in summery, to get up in that 4-5 star range, Rehab should be offering seats when they are available and be cranking up the AC and fans on a hot summer day.",

The food is good but my only complaint is that it can get very loud in there and is the summer time people come in to wait to be seated and they leave the front door wide open.  Like come on, totally not fair.  The staff should at least say something when the door stays open for a long time a nothing but hot air gets in.  The food is good and I guess it could be worth the hot air blowing in as long as u have a car parked outside with cold air conditioner when you leave.",

We had the bacon cheeseburger with a side of sweet potato tots. Yum yum yum. We also had the frito chili appetizer--holy was that delicious.

It sounds kinda weird but it was delicious. I got the Mac N Cheese burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten! Huge portions too. I could only eat about half my burger and took the rest to go. It was still good for lunch the next day! The service was very good and even though it was a packed house, our food was out in 20-25 minutes. The guy that walks around cleaning the tables is so nice too... Always has a huge smile on his face and speaks to everyone. It's a friendly and enjoyable place with great burgers. Definitely recommend!",

It started off with too much peanut butter in my mouth, it was all I could taste and the Coke wasn't cutting it. I was thinking I needed milk lol.

I won't say I'm a huge fan and I'd get it again anytime soon....they have a lot of other things I'd want to try. Our waiter was good, helpful (sorry I forgot his name, thin man with black hair), and felt bad he recommended it, but I mean I left my plate clean so it wasn't bad.   Definitely get the pretzel bun. Wife had a chicken salad, she liked it, but could only eat half...it that much. The fried were solid. I want to come back for me. The vibe was very cool.",

    "text": "Rehab Burger Therapy has been on my list for a few years now. Unfortunately, my girlfriend and I rarely venture into Old Town Scottsdale. And sadly, the only therapy I'm familiar with focuses more on speech than it does on meat.  Honestly, Rehab is a little different than I expected. I fully anticipated that it would be presented like all of those other \"high-end\" burger joints that are opening up on every street corner. I expected to be able to order a basic burger, and then proceed to have my bank account raped via upgrades, such as grass-fed beef, pretzel buns, premium ingredients, and all kinds of ridiculous tactics to raise your end price.   Surprisingly, none of that is to be found here. Rehab Burger is about showcasing both traditional and unique creations that are executed incredibly well. You can pick your bun and choose how you want your burger cooked, and at least from what I could see, there were absolutely no sneaky \"upcharges\" for any changes we opted to make.  The place itself is decorated in what I'd describe as a beach house. It kind of reminds me of some chain you'd find on the Las Vegas Strip or at a tourist destination. I was prepared for the stereotypical twenty/thirty-something hoity-toity crowd to be out in full force, but surprisingly, the clientele is a vast mix of different people. Everyone from bikers, families, teenagers, working professionals, and those guys that look as if they eat here on a daily basis. It was quite a buzzing, yet oddly comforting environment.  The menu itself is somewhat bloated and can be a little intimidating at first glance. I opted for a Spicy Mac and Cheese burger in a Relapse (5oz), while my girlfriend chose the Hangover in a full-blown Rehab (10oz). We did this so we could split the Hangover in half and I could sample both burgers.  Meat, which we both requested to be cooked medium well, was done perfectly! Great quality and flavor that clearly puts them right up there with the best we've tried. I was skeptical about the mac and cheese, as subpar mac could be the equivalent of dumping ketchup on a juicy steak. Thankfully, it delivered as promised. The spice was present, while not as overwhelming as I had feared. My girlfriend enjoyed her Hangover, but removed the pepper due to her dislike of spice. Realistically, the Relapse is more than enough for one (normal) individual, so after I finished mine, I was only able to have a few bites of hers. I thought it was done quite well, honestly.  Fries were good quality and while sweet potatoes are not my thing, the tots were just okay. I enjoyed the variety of dipping sauces that our server brought out for us to sample.  Overall, I thought their burgers were excellent and we fully intend to come back in the future to sample some other offerings. While my girlfriend wasn't quite as enthusiastic as I was about the food overall, I still feel that it's one of the better options you can find in the surrounding area.   A full five-star bump will require that we return to sample two other burgers and their dessert, which looks quite promising.  Highly recommended!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Burger Rehab for a while. With so many positive reviews, I was absolutely sure it won't be a disappointing experience and it was indeed a very good one.   My husband and I were in the area so we decided to finally try it for lunch. We went pretty late, it was around 3:00pm when we got there. Restaurant had some occupied tables inside and outside. The first thing you'll feel when you sit and start looking at the menu is how relaxing the atmosphere is. The laid back music & staff contribute to this feel, I like it!   I checked in on Yelp and I was happy to find out there was a free chips and salsa offer for checking in. Our waitress (who was great) asked if we'd like to add guacamole and we did. Soon after that, the drinks and chips, salsa and guacamole came out. I must say, their chips was fresh and the guacamole was great! It looked and tasted like it was just made! Great job you guys.   We took our time to look at the menu. My husband ordered their mushroom and Swiss burger, I with so many limited choices due to dietary constraints now, had to go for a less exciting option which was he build your own and I say less exciting only because of what I am allowed to pick! My burger was basically your standard burger with tomatoes, and a small twist, grilled onions. On the side both my husband and I decided to order fries and I asked for some spicy pineapple BBQ sauce on the side.   The burgers came out after a little while and we dug in. The taste of the meat was great. You could tell it's meat (vs fat!). The fries were cooked fresh and the BBQ sauce was super! Overall I enjoyed the burger but wasn't absolutely wowed and I say that and insist that it's not because their burger is not good but because I would have liked a funky burger rather than my basic one. This is how I'm impressed usually!   My husband enjoyed his meal a lot and was very pleased with his choice.   Definitely worth going to especially if you could try their mouth watering options. Oh and by the way, their salads (which a lot of ppl decided to order) looked amazing! I might try one of them next time!   Good food, great service and a relaxing atmosphere! Well done!",

I did a BOYB with avocado, bacon, and cheddar (lettuce wrapped) and a side of coleslaw. Their coleslaw was some of the best I've had (and I eat a ton of coleslaw). My burger was cooked to perfection, very juicy, and had great flavor. They also have some great dipping sauces as well, I'd recommend the pesto aioli. I would definitely recommend this place to someone who loves burgers. They have a couple of options for buns, great service, and the vibe inside is very casual!",

Today I got the spicy Mac n cheese and didn't do a burger but chicken with no bun and lettuce wrap. The Mac n cheese was good and can tell it's homemade. The chicken was flavorful and cooked great. The side sauces they have are awesome and you should always try as many as you can because...sauce. I got the sweet potato tots, wonderful.   The vibe is a California/Hawaii/beach relaxing atmosphere where anyone can come in with casual or suits on. Fun and loose environment. They decorated perfectly and great branding throughout.

It's got a beach theme, which I guess makes sense in an area that looks like an old western town hundreds of miles from the coast?  I ordered the Spicy Mac and Cheese Burger with the Jamaican corn, he ordered the Jalapeno Popper burger with sweet poTOToes. The meat on both burgers was seasoned to perfection. The mac and cheese burger was excellent. The Jalapeno popper burger was just \"eh\". There was too much going on here. There is unnecessary guac on there that seemed out of place. The corn was AWESOME but the tots were kind of smushy.   Overall it was really good but not quite a 5-star.",

I forgot to take a picture before I dove into the Philly Steak Burger, but I can tell you that the image of this masterpiece is indelibly burned into my brain. Try it with the pineapple barbecue sauce (I know, I was a skeptic too, but I followed the waiter's suggestion and didn't regret it. Sometimes experts really are experts).   I know the fact that I don't like beer automatically makes my opinions/reviews suspect, but my burger judging ability should not be doubted (by the way, Large  selection for those who do imbibe. I'll save my money for a Strawberry Sprinkle's Cupcake on the way back to my Timeshare).   Fantastic Service.   I kind of like the neighborhood bar look, but some might find the atmosphere a little disappointing. Then again. If you want atmosphere, go to Morton's, if you want a great burger at a VERY REASONABLE price, this is the place.   We will definitely hit this place every year when we go to Scottsdale",

There were so many choices I wanted to try but decided to go with the PB&J bacon burger which from what the server said is there most popular burger and it was definitely good. The burger comes with nice thick bacon a 10 oz patty and pb&j with siracha sauce , The burger itself has great flavor but be prepared for the news it makes which is a lot but well worth it. I opted in for there onion rings which were really good but I think not worth it for the 1.25 up charge for only 4 onion rings , if I would've known I probably would've just stuck with regular fries. Next on the order was the hatch burger which sweet potato tater tots which are a definite must try . The burger again was a 10oz patty on pretzel bun and it had a little heat to it but overall definitely another great burger can't wait to head back and try something new. Also the server was exceptional not sure of her name but the receipt copy said server FOX so just an absolute pleasure to have you serve us.",

It has both patio seating and inside. You check in at the front door and wait outside. You can also grab a drink at the bar but if it's busy then  pull have a hard time doing so. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm and there was a 25 minute wait. The sun was kinda brutal and shade was scarce but we were lucky to find some.   Granted, I'm here during my spring break so I figured other people are too cause it's like a scene straight out of a college movie. The islander/beach decor and loud groups bring me back to Spring Break In San Diego or Florida.  We got the 10oz spicy mac and cheese burger, pig wings, and sweet poTOToes. I wish the burger lived up to its name because it wasn't spicy at all. Yes there were jalapenos but when you call something spicy I was hoping the bun would also have a kick. The mac n cheese was an interesting and yummy addition. The pig wings were really my favorite because it was tender and a good combo of savory and sweet. The sweet pototoes were crunchy but I got tired of them really quickly.   All in all, this is a great place to go for a hearty burger and to get that Spring Break vibe.",

Looked on Yelp for more choices and we are glad we took a chance at Rehab.  I had the Chili burger, dad had the philly cheese steak and the boys had the Holt?!?, which was pepper type burger.  We all loved our burgers and sides.  Very tasty and filling.   The vibe is very surfer/skate hoarder and relaxed.  Friendly helpful staff.  Burgers around $10+, but comes with a side.  I will definitely come back.",

The burgers are really good but tonight it was a little off; green Chile wasn't hot at all and kind of tough and burger was a little cold. Normally though, I would suggest the hangover burger for sure.  We ordered onion rings for the first time tonight as our side and it was only 5 rings which isn't much when you're paying $14.59 for a burger. The upside is the grilled cheese (one of very few options a picky kid will eat) is HUGE and came with a decent side of fries.  Beers are fairly pricey when it's not happy hour.  Overall I would come here again but I do think it's a bit overpriced.",

They have a huge selection that should meet most people's tastes.  For those that are not in a burger mood, they also have a few other choices like salads, fish n chips, etc.  You can also order other burger varieties such as turkey and veggie.  Tip: Unless you're super hungry or have a big appetite, the smaller size is plenty big.  The fries are OK...not bad but nothing stellar.  I thought the sweet potato taters were better.  They're not crunch like you might expect, which was just fine for me.  Price-wise, the burgers are bit on the higher end of the spectrum for burgers but that's typical for a specialty burger joint.    Overall, a recommended place if you love gourmet burgers.",

The Skinny drinks are amazing too.    They have a great menu to make any customer happy.

I tried the Bacon Cheese Turkey Burger with Sweet Potato tots.  The server recommended Manchego cheese and I thank him for this great suggestion.  The Mushroom and Swiss Turkey Burger was full of flavor and delicious.  The sweet potato tots are the perfect size.  They offer several dipping sauces for the fries and tots.  My favorites include Pineapple Teryaki Aioli, Chipotle Aioli, and , Chipotle Ranch.    I think the secret is out about Rehab Burger.  It does get busy but it is worth the wait.

Note to self: IT'S HUGE!!!  It was a double stacked sandwich that was hard for me to even bite into, but I'll be completely honest...it was DELICIOUS!  Our other friends went for the massive burgers which they both loved the pretzel buns.  Seems that's what everyone raves about so I'm not too surprised.  The only thing that I was kinda bummed about was the beer.  All of our beers were luke warm.  I like my beer so cold it hurts my teeth so it was hard to ignore that it was warm.

Came here with a bunch of co-workers. As usual I couldn't decide on just one thing, so I split two burgers with a co-worker/buddy of mine: the PB&J burger, and the turkey burger.  I believe we got the PB&J on a prezel bun, and the other one on a focaccia. The turkey burger was pretty good (it's main characteristic was the massive 10 oz patty), but it was the PB&J burger that really shone. It mingled sweet and savory, with the textures of tender beef, hearty but soft/moist prezel bun, light jelly and hearty peanut butter into what I can only describe as a culinary journey to another world.   It was gone before I could fully process what I was eating.   Of course the sweet potato fries and the whole host of unique dipping sauces was great.  The other star of the night was the pot brownie (no there isn't pot it in), but IT'S in a large pot... of marshmallows, brownie, caramel, ice-cream... just overwhelming delicious and excess.   Finally, there was a well rounded and delicious selection of beers.   Definitely make the trip if you can.",

Pretzel bun lacked that pretzel flavor (probably not enough salt in the dough) and the Jamaican corn was wrinkly and missing that plump juiciness you expect from corn. Also the mushrooms on my burger tasted like they came from a can... Pretty disappointing.",

    "text": "When we travel, we want to hit up a highly rated pizza place and a highly rated burger place wherever we go.  The reviews and the menu for Rehab looked solid, so we went, and the only conclusion I can come to is that there are a lot of really crappy burger places in Scottsdale.  The food was passable.  The patties were fine and cooked correctly but unremarkable, and the toppings were varied and included some interesting choices.  The potatoes (sweet potato tots and regular fries) were more of the same.  Not bad, but nothing terribly interesting.  But the service.  My God, the service.  I don't know that I can remember all of the things that went wrong, but I can assure you this stands out in my mind as one of the top three worst service experiences I can ever remember having.  We were seated for about 10 minutes before anyone came by to say hi.  We had some salads and burgers and we were here for over an hour.  This is not a fine dining establishment, and we were not loitering.  My burger came out with no fries.  Nothing, just a burger on a plate, and no one thought \"Hey, that looks funny.\"  And it wasn't just us!  The couple seated next to us sat down about 15 minutes after we did.  They probably sat for 15 minutes before anyone came to take their orders.  They got a couple beers about 15 minutes later, and by the time we left, they STILL had no food in front of them!  We told our waiter when we left that these poor people had been completely ignored all night, and we hoped that would maybe get some attention to them.  For all I know, they're still sitting there silently, waiting for someone to give them some food.  The food was fine, but not in a million years would I come back here to be disrespected and ignored just to have a burger and fries.",

Everything I've had here is flavorful yet very distinct from other burger joints - not an uncommon cuisine by any means - with reasonable pricing and a cool vibe.  I like the environment, with the chill surfer decor. With tables and high tops it doesn't feel crowded at all. Although I find it extremely difficult to fit large groups - most tables are arranged for a size of 4. I just eat here with a couple friends so not my concern.  Back to the burgers - fantastic. They have innovative toppings like the PB&J Bacon Burger with sriracha and Ghost Burger with ghost pepper jack. Ghost's my favorite, and the pepper jack is definitely elevated compared to jalapenos but not like sign-a-waiver hot.  My favorites here have been off the menu specials. They have a Mac and Cheese Burger with hatch chill M&C pouring off the patty - twice the radius of the burger itself. And the weekend burger that's essential egg's benedict on a burger.   Get me a 10 oz Rehab size of any of those with my sweet potato tots and I will always leave super satisfied.",

Last time I was there, I managed to eat the Mac Gnarly burger, and we're not talking the \"relapse\" size (which is the size of a normal large fancy burger).  I'm talking the legit Rehab size.  You know, the double patty special that you stare at when it arrives, not even sure if you get get your muscles to pick up the thing.  I've also had the Jalapeno Popper burger, which is great if you're craving something fried and slightly unhealthy.  I love the Mac Gnarly, though, because the large amount of veggies makes it feel *almost* healthy...as long as you order the small size.  We've also split an order of the pig wings, which come with a BBQ sauce even better than it sounds.  I've been hoping to try the Pot Brownies sometime (no illicit drugs included - wrong state, people!) but have been too stuffed from the entree every time and haven't been able to order dessert yet.  I've made a promise to myself... next time I go to Rehab, I'll walk out a new woman, instead of being rolled out in a wheelbarrow.",

The last time I came here was on my 40th birthday but for some reason   I remember the burger having more more flavor back then. The burger tasted a little bland so I added some salt & pepper and that fixed the problem. I ordered the Relapse Hatch burger medium well and it was Huge, juicy, and delicious.  My wife ordered the byob burger, mayo, tomato, onion, cheese, and she said it was great. I went there with my whole family and they ordered all kinds of stuff it was ridiculous. The peanut butter and jam sandwich was huge/delicious, hot wings- good and so was the Alfredo San Carlos pasta. If you go here make sure you bring your appetite because there are no small portions served. The best thing about it was the price because there was 12 of us and the bill was 110 bucks and we had 4 to go plates left over. The only thing that I can complain about here is the wait and bathrooms. Sometimes the wait is 30 mins long or more and the bathrooms are small.",

However, the happy hour (before 6pm) prices for drinks were a great price. I had the Blue Moon pint for $3.50. The servers are also very attentive and nice.

We got the Ghost burger which has Ghost Pepper Jack Cheese on it. Pretty spicy but not burn your face off either. Not sure how a whole one would fare since the last bite of a half had my mouth pretty fiery. The serving was large enough for two people to share, which we did. The Onion Rings which came with it at an extra charge were only fair so maybe stick with the fries.   The server was pretty cool, funny and talented. The place was packed.

On this particular visit I ordered the PB&J Bacon Burger, and was a bit surprised how well the flavors blended together. I also had a bite of my dining partner's Hangover Burger which was also delightful.   That being said, their sides are AWFUL. French fries - so over cooked and bad that I almost broke my sobriety. Sweet potato tots - so soggy and bland that no treatment could help them. Onion rings - enough grease to fill a few shot glasses.  The service was awesome and not your typical Scottsdale vibe.

Great menu options and if you are gluten-free like I am they have great tasting gluten-free items and a large variety to choose from. I ordered the byob burger on a gf bun with the pineapple bbq sauce and it was cooked exactly the way I wanted it and it tasted so good. If you are gluten-free you know how difficult eating out with your family can be and your choices can be very limited,  but not at rehab!  Definitely try the sweet potato tots, they are amazing! The service was excellent from everyone we encountered, the hostess, the manager, the server, and the bartender. My bloody mary was perfect and my husband's beers were ice cold. The decor is very relaxed beach vibe, makes you want to hang out there all day. I'm definitely going back!",

My son was curious, then went with the 10 oz. jalapeno popper burger & fries. Burger was huge & fries were crisp. My husband went with smaller Patty Melt & onion rings. Both were very good. I had the chili burger with no bun & the sweet poTOToes with chipotle aioli. The chili was very meaty & had the right amount of beans. I would have liked it with a touch more heat, but it was still tasty. The sweet potato tater tots were quite crisp & good with the aioli. The atmosphere is definitely bar-like, but I wouldn't have a problem taking young children there. While not haute cuisine, Rehab serves good burgers and a good selection of beer. The rest of the menu looked good as well. I would recommend it to someone looking for burgers in the area.",

    "text": "This place is fantastic. I went here a few days ago and was really blown away. It looks \"ok\" from the outside, a little ran down and kind of shoved back behind RnR off the corner, we weren't expecting much. Little did we know when we walked in how cool, fun and delicious this place would be. It's definitely got the Cali feel to it, with pics on the walls, bikes, surf boards, and fish tanks on the TV! It's really neat the way they gave this tiny place such a big Cali feel.  The place was packed on a Sunday early afternoon, so we sat at the bar. I ordered the chicken pesto pasta and my friend ordered the hangover burger. It didn't take long for the food to get out to us, while waiting we people watched and enjoyed our beverages! The food was AMAZING!!!! The pesto had a weird mix to it, when I ate a bite with no chicken it was meh, on the ok side, but when I added a piece of their marinated chicken in the mix my taste buds went bananas! It was crazy! I started laughing so hard because the chicken brought out so much more flavor of the pesto sauce! Man am I becoming a foodie. Their hang over burger was to die for. It sounds weird at first, but then when you think about it, you're trying to figure out why no one has combined eggs, bacon, colby jack cheese and green chili on top of some deliciously cooked hamburger before! I had one bite of my friend's hamburger and I was hooked. We both started chowing down like we hadn't eaten in days! I didn't think this lunch could get any better, until I checked in and noticed a coupon for their brownies! Ahhhhh man that did us in! The brownie came out super hot (watch your tongue ouchy) with some recess chocolate pieces in it, with of course ice cream on top.....DELICIOUS! I literally don't remember the drive home because I was in a food coma from this place! My friend was lucky they didn't have to roll me out the door!  I can't wait to go back! This place is awesome!!!! Keep it up Rehab, you definitely showed me what I have been missing out on!  PS - Staff was fantastic! Everyone was so happy, smiling, courteous, and helpful, it was awesome! Not one sad face in the whole house! You don't see that much anymore! You're staff is awesome!",

I have heard really amazing things about this place from a lot of my friends. Although I prefer to only eat natural, antibiotic free, grass fed meat, the feedback on this place was so great I knew I had to give it a try. The location is great and parking not too bad. We didn't have to wait to be seated. Once we were seated though, it was 40 minutes before we got our food, which felt like a really long time. Our waitress was a really nice laid back lady, and the other staff seemed really nice. Sadly, my cheeseburger was good, but not amazing. I loved the bun and the meat was good, but it just kind of was like most other burgers, flavored with pepper. The fries were very good, but not quite amazing. The shake came out and was the consistency of chocolate milk, so I asked them to remake it. It came out thicker and colder, but was average, not great.   Maybe I just am holding everything up to a standard from a place that I can't have anymore :) I will have to give this place a try again another day.",

The restaurant is tiny so when it's busy you have to wait a little bit. We only waited five minutes. Got a great waitress who was very down to earth. She offered good recommendations. I ordered the PBJ burger. Kinda crazy. But believe me, it was awesome!  The blend of peanut butter, jelly, bacon, and a sauce was awesome! Messy but tasted wonderful. Then the tater tots are so wonderful. My boyfriend also got a burger of course and loved his! I recommend this highly. Awesome place and the best burgers in town.",

    "text": "Ok, I don't review often, only either very bad or very good.  I'm sorry, I wanted to like this place, very cool vibe but lets get down to the heart of the matter.  They make burgers.  If you don't care about the quality of the burger and are easily distracted by add ons like poblano peppers, chili, mac and cheese and the like than this may be for you.  For a burger purist...um... no.  This is the second time I gave them a try, I order my double relapse burger medium rare so as to have a little juice and flavor....denied!!  I don't know how they get a burger to be pink inside with absolutely no juice left whatsoever!  I'm serious, I am eating a tasteless dry ass pink burger.  I show my GF as I squeeze the burger on the plate with a fork and.......nothing.  Not a bit of juice, no frigging flavor whatsoever.  This tasteless burger is hiding behind all the bells and whistles of the toppings. If you have to go, just trust me and try a piece of the meat without all the crap and sauce.  Bland, bland, bland.  As for the sides, not terrible, but the gf tater tots came out cold and soggy.  They were replaced with hot ones on request, but really!!!  For $40 plus for a beer, hamburgers and frys for 2, you would think it would be hot and fresh the first time everytime.  If you are looking for cool place to chill have a beer and drop $40-50 bucks on very average burgers, then come on in. Otherwise, check out Cold Beer and Cheesburgers, Smashburger, Habit or any one of a dozen places where you won't feel like you just got hozed and a burger comes out like god intended, pink and juicy.",

We ordered and waited about 30-40 mins for our food. 2 parties came in after us and were both served before us by a large margin of time. Our waitress didn't come check on our drinks or ask how our food was, which was OK at best. She messed up a couple of our burgers by trying to memorize and not write our orders down and that was a bummer because we already waited so long. They weren't busy so I am not sure what the deal was. Maybe she didn't like that we all wanted separate checks, but its a business trip. We're from Vegas so we know how to tip, but she sort of ruined that for herself. Shame when people don't do their jobs and then will complain about a crappy tip.",

    "text": "Interesting Atmosphere. Good Burgers     Friends had recommended Rehab Burger Therapy some time ago, but when I reviewed the menu online, it didn't hold much appeal for me.   Finally, the other day when I had a taste for a Plaza Burger (burger with sour cream and chopped onions) Rehab was the only burger place I could identify nearby that definitely had sour cream on the menu.   I walked in for a late lunch, and luckily found a seat at the bar. The place was packed both inside and outside. The staff was really swamped, but my server took the time to flash me a big smile when she came to take my order. I ordered my relapse (small, 5oz) burger medium rare with sour cream and onions. I was about to order sweet potato tots, but the woman to the left of me looked like she was really enjoying her skin on fries, so I decided on them instead.  When my server brought my food, she again smiled, and I noticed that she made a point of smiling at everyone. It was a nice touch. My fries were hot, delicious, crispy and perfectly salted. My burger, unfortunately, was over cooked (well done). I didn't take the time to send it back because I was very hungry, and short of time. I did mention it to the server and she indicated that the kitchen tends to overcook the small burgers. She suggested that the rehab burger (large, 10oz) is more likely to be cooked to the desired level of doneness, but I also might want to order the small burger rare the next time. (I appreciated the information) She offered to have it remade, but I had already nearly finished it. It wasn't bad by any means, just more done than I like. If I could have given an award to her for friendly service, I would have done so.   Overall I liked the place and enjoyed my food enough to go back and take a friend a few days later. We ordered our small burgers rare (with lots of emphasis..) and we received perfectly cooked burgers, although our fries were barely warm. We were short of time and happy with our burgers and let the cool fries slide. She loved the Hatch Burger, and I stuck with my sour cream and onion burger again.",

They seemed to have changed the recipe because when I went there this last time it was horrible. It made me nauseous. I'll never order that again, good thing they still have a menu full of other amazing food.",

But that was just our bad planning.  The hostess up front was so friendly and kept checking in on us to give us status which I appreciated, and once a table became available, their team rushed to get it cleaned up for us.  Their options are great, with something for everyone.  I had my 4 year old with me, and even though they don't have a kids menu, the waitress advised of the options they could make for her.  She had a chicken breast and fries, and she loved it.  Most everyone at the table had burgers and fries, which were pretty great, and the sauce options for dipping were awesome.  I had the Beijing Salad.  It was huge and like nothing I have had anywhere else.  Very spicy, but the waitress offered Ranch to cool me down.  I love hot, so it was very good for me.  We sat outside, and it reminded me of being in Baja.  Loved it. I will go back again.",

It was a nice day out but the sun was beating on us so we decided to move inside.  As we were looking at the menu, we realized there was happy hour til 3.  Sweet.  We ordered a couple of beers and the hangover burger burger (rehab) to share and regular fries.  The burger was a perfect medium with all the juices, cheese and sauces blending together so deliciously.  I could taste a hint of the hatch green chili which gave it a nice little kick.  Loved the fried egg, loved the bacon= great burger!  I'm glad I shared it though because between the beers and fries, I was barely able to finish my half of the burger.",

They have a nice, varied menu and you feel like you want to settle in. It was crazy hot when we were in Scottsdale and I love the heat, but it seemed like the air was a bit too much.

Portions are very large as described in other reviews and photos. No kids menu but my little ones shared a hotdog and fries and left very full. My other daughter had the pasta alfredo and said its the best she has ever had. Even said it was better than olive gardens which is HUGE for her.   Not a lot of parking up front but a parking lot next door. The restuarant itself was smaller. We got there around 5:30 pm on a Tuesday and it was already busy. Luckily we didnt have to wait but if we had arrived 20 minutes later we would have been waiting awhile. We almost didn't come here because another yelper said it wasn't that kid friendly due to sitting. Sitting is rough and I would partially agree with not being kid friendly but defitinely somewhere you can take your kids if they can sit still.   You can get 7% cash back and $3.99 chips and salsa for checking in.   Staff was also super friendly and can handle a big crowd.   Can't wait to go back.",

I came here for a work event recently, and I know it's been in Scottsdale forever but I somehow have never stopped by. The interior is like that of a beach shack, they specialize in burgers clearly, but they also have a lot of other options like fish tacos and some fried appetizers.   I ordered the margatini which was pretty much everything I like in a glass, a fancy martini glass at that! I don't really know where my aversion to frozen beverages came from, but I hate frozen margaritas, and I'm so happy they have a different option. But, that being said, all my coworkers loved their frozen drinks.   We ordered the calamari and chips and salsa to start. The calamari was excellent, the chips and salsa weren't anything special. For entrees many people did the BYOB and sweet potato tots, they all looked amazing! I ordered a turkey burger with a lettuce \"bun\" and their onion rings. I loved the turkey burger itself, but the lettuce wrap was more like a bunch of little lettuce pieces, like a salad. The onion rings with the chipotle aioli are a must!   We as a group skipped dessert. I will say this was reasonably priced and the serving sizes were huge. For a super casual vibe and quick service I'll definitely come back.",

I asked if I could order take out at the bar and was told that would be fine. Walked up to the bartender who said, oh sorry, we're closed.    I did have a chance to speak to the owner, who was apologetic and offered a seat and to keep the kitchen open for me, I'd lost my taste for Rehab Burger.   Would I go again?

For it has become a burger, yes The Hangover is not just a movie & a state of \"man I'm never gonna drink like that anymore\" feeling; you know who you are Mr. Patron! Now a Hangover is also a burger served at the Rehab Burger Therapy!  When I first walked into this bar I thought of Bar Rescue on Spike -- where's Jon Taffer!?  The place had some pretty cool decor and design; surfboards, guitars, and an aquatic background.    Anyways, I sat at the bar where I was greeted with a smile.  Great service here I must add!  Read the menu up and down and decided to go with the Hangover.  Boys, I saw her first!  It was DE-licous with a capitol D!  For Damn!!! That was good!  Medium done with bacon, fried egg, colby cheese, and green chilies - Yum!  I went with the Relapse, which was a smaller version of the regular sized burger.  HH everyday till 6pm so if you can make it I definitely would stop by.    The place has the rock n roll, surfer, tiki ambience.  Reminded my friend of Hawaii she claims.  I've never been to HI, but personal I'm content with being at the Rehab for now with a few drinks and enjoying a Hangover - yes I said enjoy the Hangover. - Enjoy!",

When I mentioned it to our server, she actually said yeah it's 92 degrees in here, our ventilation sucks... So apparently this is an everyday thing, not an a/c on the fritz. 92 is not an ok temperature to have lunch indoors! Temperature aside, the service was friendly but VERY slow. I ordered the Beijing Beefstro salad. It was greasy and just not appetizing. I can take partial blame for ordering a a salad at a burger joint, but wow this salad was just gross. They did take it off the bill when I said it wasn't what I expected, so that's the bright side. My friend liked her chicken sandwich and sweet tots. I tasted the tots, and they were good. I don't think I'll come back here... definitely not in the summer.",

    "text": "This was my second time trying Rehab burger but at a different location (The first was the newer Tempe restaurant). We had a 15-20 minute wait which wasn't bad at all. We had actually tried to go here months earlier but there was a two hour wait so we went somewhere else. We browsed around the pawn shop next door to kill time and came back in about 20 minutes. Timing was perfect because they were just finishing up cleaning our table.   The check in offer on Yelp is for discounted chips and salsa ($3.99), the regular price is $5.50. We decided to forgo the offer since it was just a discounted price and go straight for the burgers! I forgot how many different choices there are on the menu, so many of them sounded good it was hard to decide. Finally, I spied the word Hatch chile... I can't resist anything with Hatch chile in it! The smaller 5 oz size automatically comes on a beef patty unless specified differently but if you get the 10 oz size you can get a different patty. I also spied beef chorizo patty... Chorizo and Hatch chile, what a perfect combo! Our server recommended the pretzel bun and anything up to medium for the doneness of the burger, so I went with the pretzel bun and medium rare patty. You also have a choice of sweet potato tots or fries but can upgrade to chili fries for an extra fee (I got the tots).  It took quite some time for our burgers to be made. I got hungrier and hungrier and the din from the other customers seemed to increase in volume as it got busier. Finally... our burgers arrived! Mine was piping hot with a generous serving of sweet potato tots. Biting into the burger, I liked the pretzel bun and the cheese was nicely melted over the patty. The actual patty was disappointing though. It had a very mild chorizo flavor and was like eating a hockey puck it was so overdone. I pulled back the bun and noticed the chile wasn't your typical Hatch chile color and was a very very dark green instead of light to medium green. It also didn't have the same flavor and texture as a Hatch chile...perhaps they pulled a switcheroo on me and used a Poblano instead?   I liked the sweet potato tots which had a soft sweetness with lightly crisp exterior. They did taste more sweet than your usual sweet potato though... Perhaps they mix in a generous amount of sugar in the sweet potato mixture?  My burger was $11 and I felt it was very overpriced for what I got. I haven't been really that impressed with their burgers so I suppose there's no need for me to go into burger rehab for Rehab Burger!  2.5/5",

The rest of the staff also made sure by always asking how things were every time walked by.    Overall great dining experience.",

We like to split the double Gnarly Mac burger on pretzel bun with fries which is modeled after the Big Mac  (burger is always plenty but might want to order a second basket of fries if you're sharing!) I'm pregnant right now and totally missing their frozen Coronarita's - they're better than anyone's in our opinion! Service is always friendly and they are always busy- tend to wait 5-25 min for a table of 2. Try to hit it up on a Thursday when Happy Hour is open-close  or weekday 3-6!",

We were expecting them to be busy but luckily we got a couple seats at the bar which is open seating. The Bartender was fast with our drinks and very friendly. She was patient with explaining the burgers and the toppings. I chose the Ghost pepper burger and my wife got some mushroom burger with onion rings.   It didn't take long before we were staring down what looked like almost a undoable task. The burgers were huge! We dug right in and my wife was absolutely in love with hers. She told me she could tell this place used real mushrooms, not the canned stuff. As for mine.. Damn, I underestimated the hotness of Ghost Pepper.. It snuck up on me and it was a constant burn.. The whole time. I enjoyed it though (However, I didn't enjoy it 6 hrs later). The burger was cooked to perfection and the toppings were amazing. I do feel like they could have salted and peppered the meat a little bit though. Other then that It was bomb diggity! I will def make it back and try another one of their amazing burgers.",

Decent beer selection and the burgers are legit!  I had the hatch burger on the pretzel bun (beyond yum) and fries.  I loved it completely!    Really fun, laid back place.  I would come back!",

Was surprisingly busy when we went, which was on a weeknight, there were no tables available inside. Sign that this place has got to be good. Also I love the California-type decor and vibes going on, cool looking! We sat outside and the heat lamps were like burning us so when I go again if it's cold I'd probably wait it out and sit inside haha. Our server was awesome, very attentive. Wait staff deserves a high five! The menu was huge, and once I realized you could substitute a veggie patty for any of the regular burgers that made my decision a little harder. I decided to just get the regular veggie burger though because it comes with avocado! My boyfriend had a tough time choosing between the turkey burger or the bacon burger, but he couldn't resist the power of bacon. Another nice thing is that you can choose what kind of bun you want, wheat, pretzel, or brioche. We went for the brioche, but I'd like to try the pretzel! Was feeling indecisive for my side so I asked for half sweet potato tots and half regular fries. Was an excellent choice, best of both worlds haha. They were both perfectly crisp and yummy sides, the tots were especially good when I stuffed a few into my veggie burger. Oh and the veggie burger was phenomenal! It was kind of unique too which I love! White beans, black beans, and panko crusted, yum! Also the avocado on top was so fresh. I usually refuse to cut my burgers in half but this one I had to because it was massive. And messy! But so tasty. I liked the aioli it came with too, was the perfect touch. My boyfriend enjoyed everything as well and we both ate way too much haha. Can't wait to come back!",

Get the smaller one (5oz.) plenty big and cheaper unless you are REALLY REALLY hungry.   Also note, other than fries, the sides cost extra, but the side salad was pretty big. Overall prices were a bit high, even for Scottsdale, and the reviews for the sweet potato tots were not good at my table. Also service was friendly but also slow. On the plus side, they split our bill without even asking. I would go back, but definitely get the smaller burger, and stick to the side salad or coleslaw.",

He apologized for this mistake and told me he would refund the full $5.00 to my husband's card. Well... here we are almost 2 months later and still no refund. Extremely disappointing. The food was adequate. Service was average. And the lack of accommodations for someone with a small child was impolite. I'm suppose to change my child's diaper on the restroom floor.

The result was I thin piece of lettuce on each side of burger. Of course we couldn't pick it up and eat it.   Why would we expect quality on $15 burgers.   The sweet potato tots might've been good,  if they were fresh, but there was no way we were sending back after we got an idea of how the place responded to our lettuce wrap request.   Rehab should seriously go to In n Out Burger or Carl's Junior to see how proper lettuce wrap burgers are done with quality.

Burger was over cooked and not even exceptionally warm anymore. Fries were good. Server looked like she was either having a bad morning or still waking up, at 11:30am.  The grilled cheese my boyfriend ordered was pretty solid, but the milkshake could use something more than Hershey's syrup and milk with a scoop of vanilla.  Overall a pretty meh experience :/",

Our server was so adorable and very friendly.  We ordered the spicy mac and cheese burger with regular fries and I ordered the Hawaiian burger with pretzel bun along with sweet potatoe tots. We waited about 5-10 minutes and our delicious looking food came to us. My server also included different sauces for me to try.   The sweet potatoe tots were yummy with the Ketchum and by itself. They weren't crispy tots but a little on the soft side. Our burgers were hard to hold and eat so we just cut them up. My Hawaiian burger was a little bland, so it helped that I had a pickle to kick in some flavor. My friend couldn't find her patty under the mounds of mac and cheese she received between her hamburger bun, but she said it was pretty good! However, the amount of carbs were getting to her. What I liked most was our burgers were not disgustingly greasy and I didn't feel the nasty heaviness you usually feel after eating an epic burger.  Would really love to come back and try the other burgers though :)  love the friendliness and the ambience.",

Parking is tough so expect to wait a little bit.  As for the meal, the burger is huge and absolutely love the pretzel bun twist. That might have been the best part of my meal. I tried to BBQ burger and it was decent, a little over cooked for my liking.  I also highly recommend the onion rings as a starter for the table to share! Lastly, I ordered a beer with my meal and I waited, waited, and it never came. The server finally realized but at that point I was almost done with my meal. If some of these things get fixed, my review may be able to get to 4 stars.",

I had the smaller of the two burgers, which was huge!  I will be back anytime I'm in Scottsdale, I will send anyone who asks \"where should I go in Scottsdale?\" there.

Has a Hawaii/So Cal beach vibe - like Islands but less corporate.   Burgers are enourmous. Had the Jalapeno Popper Burger, medium rare and subbed in onion rings. Burger was alright. Had a charbroil-flavor overtone to it, which, unfortunately was the predominate flavor. Also, there's too much going on with this burger. Massive amount of guacamole, little fired pieces of jalapenos seated within the guac and well, you need a knife and fork to eat it. I never have a problem with the size of a burger - it's a beautiful thing.   Going to try a more simple, straight-forward burger next time but if the overly-charbroiled flavor persists the second round, it'll be my last visit. I'm optimistic.  It's in line with Scottsdale Old Town pricing - $16 for a badass burger. Cheaper burgers are to be had, and for me, the next time will be less extravagant, which will obviously be better on the ole pocket book.",

The burger was amazing, the slaw was very blan- I wouldn't pay the up charge for it again. Our server was super peppy, smiley and helpful. We will be back!",

The PBJ burger was well cooked, the PBJ was a different combo but enexpectedly tasty, I would get it again. The sweet potato tots and the dipping sauce were a nice change from the usual fries and ketchup.  The downside to the restaurant was the wait. We were seated in under 5 minutes, but after that we waited almost 45 minutes from seated until our food finally showed up! There were people seated after us who got their food before and the same time as us. Not sure what the big hold up was.  TL;DR - tasty food, long wait. I'm not sure it was worth a 45 minute wait.",

You don't buy food, cook it, serve it, get paid and go out partying........ Sadly...that is the attitude at 7 out of 10 places, regardless of city/state....  Rehab Burgers is wonderful. Starting with the extremely friendly hostesses, the exceptionally friendly waitstaff, the amazing bartenders, and the whole time, the owners ARE ACTUALLY THERE, asking if everything is ok?  What a concept! Are you listening Scottsdale restaurant groups? (you know who you are)............So many places serve cheap food with an attitude, and get crowded for  happy hour 2-for-1 well drinks, and the doosh DJ playing loud house music from his jump-drive, wooo freaking hooo.......yes I am over 25....  Ok, anyway, went for Sunday afternoon Burger Rehab. Cold beer, reasonably priced, fresh burger, cooked the way i asked, fresh bun, amazing sweet potato tots, and homemade spicy ketchup (are you kidding me?)  The most important thing ............... staff... Exceeded expectations...  The food is great and reasonable. The staff is exceptional... THAT IS WHAT BRINGS PEOPLE BACK......Best, Duke .........",

They are light and not greasy.  My Brioche bun was a nice compliment to the burger nice and fresh. Wings were  fine but I would say stick to the burger...AKA  why it's called Rehab Burger Therapy...it's a burger place.  Don't forget the margarita...high quality!

    "text": "I love Burger Rehab usually. Our experience on July 6 was less than stellar however. It was after 1 when we got there and of course there was a wait. Not unusual but they have no place for you to really wait so we just kind of hovered for more than 30 minutes. We were told we could wait on the patio but it was 110 so I don't think so. The misters were on but the sun umbrellas were not open for whatever reason. The inside temp was probably 90 so I don't suggest going there on a 110 degree day. Our 89 year old friend we took had a hard time standing for that long and no one offered her a chair. After we had been there for 30 minutes someone finally offered us water.   Now for the food. I have been there many times and usually have no complaints but my turkey burger was not good. It was over spiced and the tomatoes, avocado, lettuce and sprouts all dumped in the middle. I had to take it all apart separate the 2 slices of tomato, slice the avocado and place them appropriately on the burger, I just dumped the sprouts because they and the iceberg lettuce just looked disgusting. My bun was dried out on top and sogged on the bottom so much that it was impossible to pick up. I ended up using my fork. My hubby's chicken was fine but the bun was not right on his either.  Now for the service. Definitely subpar and the waitress was rather snotty. When I asked for extra ketchup and mustard she made a sarcastic remark like she was being overburdened.  I still recommend Burger Rehab but wait until it's cooler when they are not all crabby from being too hot.",

I'd been a few years back and I know the burgers were very good so when my friend told me he wanted to try for his first time I was totally IN!  When we arrived we were advised of the 35 minute wait and waited with no problem. The host was a bit snippy so I didn't really appreciate that but I let it go since he was probably overwhelmed. Once we were eventually seated I ordered the Yelp special chips and salsa right away and they took forever to come. Once they arrived we ordered our burgers since the server was often gone for long periods of time. Don't get me wrong, she was extremely nice and efficient I just feel she was too busy. They should've had more servers IMO. Anyway.. the chips and salsa were very good.  Chips tasted fresh and home made and the salsa is as mild and flavorful. I ordered the hatch burger and my friend ordered the backyard BBQ burger. Both were phenomenal and the small side of onion rings set it over the top. All in all it was a great ambiance and very good food. 4 stars for the snippy host and the Fact we had to stay there for 3 hours because the server hardly came around :/.",

I go back through my pictures on my phone to glance at this burger because I am constantly craving it. Also, my first time having mac and cheese on a burger, and sweet potato tater tots.   I am from New Mexico, so I can't tell you how happy I was to hear that they use green chile from Hatch, NM! The burger was cooked perfect, the mac and cheese was amazing, and the green chile had a nice kick. I was pretty determined to finish the entire meal, but ended up only eating about half (Yes, I took the rest to-go and finished it later). Service was great, I believe our server's name was Lauren, or \"Lo\" - she was awesome. Probably some of the best service I have experienced in a long time. She was super attentive, always filled our water cups quick (it was hot), and made great suggestions. We didn't have to wait for a table either, and we went on a Friday night around 7pm. I think I will make the drive to Scottsdale specifically for this burger.",

We walked in and were greeted right away, and seated. The place was moderately busy. Our waiter Ryan was over right away, with a great personality and a big smile. He took our drink orders, and gave us time to look over our menus. They have two sizes of burgers to choose from Rehab is the bigger one, and relapse is the smaller one. I chose the relapse Hawaiian burger. It came with pineapple slice, ham slice, cheese, sweet mayo, and I chose a gluten-free bun. I chose the sweet potato tots for my side. Our good came out in a reasonable amount of time, and was delicious! My burger was cooked perfectly, and the sweet potato tots were very good. We started with the chips and salsa, as they were only $3.99 with the check in offer! The chips were homemade as well as the salsa and both very good. Ryan made sure our drinks were never empty. The decor is beachy, and there is ample seating inside, and outside on the patio. They have a bar. I can not wait to stop by here again to try another 5 star burger!",

The burgers come either in 5oz or 10oz sizes - we got both in the 10oz, which was a bit much for lunch - would recommend the 5oz unless your really hungry.  The fries are good - but would suggest substituting for the sweet potato tater tots.  They come with an aioli dipping sauce which is a nice combination.",

    "text": "Rehab fully embraces the idea that fried foods play a critical role in comforting society from hangovers and bad days. I showed up because Pig & Pickle had a gas leak, and quickly scanned Yelp for an alternative.  Rehab lets you throw a veggie patty, or any patty (turkey, chicken, etc.), on any burger. So the menu felt expansive. Look closely enough at the huge menu and you'll find endless puns about rehab.   The ghost burger wasn't spicy. Maybe because it used \"ghost pepper jack cheese\" instead ghost peppers. I'm not even sure what that is. The \"relapse\" (two patties) was too much patty; I'll put that one on me.   But the patties themselves were not so great, which was disappointing because the menu called it hand pressed. The guacamole was a disaster, too, emblematic of the American avocado craze gone too far. I only finished about a quarter of my burger before calling it quits.   I will say that the bun was decent and the sweet potato tots were worth the upgrade.  My favorite part of the night was when I was talking with my friend about kids while eating at the bar. A complete stranger waiting at the bar looked over and said, \"Whoa man you don't want kids. See that girl over there? I knocked her up and now I gotta support her, and she isn't even that hot.\" I looked over at him, then down at my burger, uncertain how to respond. I guess burgers and alcohol bring out the honesty in people. It also made me realize that Rehab was probably more bar than burger.  The service was pretty slow . One bartender had to manage fifteen people's food orders, plus all the drinks for the restaurant. I felt bad for him; he was certainly overworked.  If I come back, I'll take the burger into my own hands. I expect to request some toppings combination of fresh jalapeno, onion rings, BBQ sauce, extra ghost pepper jack cheese, hot sauce, etc. Maybe that will do the trick.",

When someone orders a blue cheese burger, it's because they LOVE blue cheese and lots of it. This one did not disappoint in any way, shape or form! I wanted to cry over not being able to finish it from lack of stomach space (I tried really hard though). The sweet potato tots were really good with the pineapple sauce. I also had a VERY generous \"Mike Tai\" (their spin on the Mai Tai). I love it when a place gives you a drink you can feel! The service was outstanding and it seemed the owners were there working too (I can usually tell). They clearly have a lot of pride in their restaurant.  Now that the review of MY awesome experience is over with, I will say that my boyfriend's burger wasn't as good. He was a huge fan of this place already, so it's no big deal, BUT... the waitress that talks up the PB&J burger really should stop (I'm not the only Yelper who thinks so). Some things are an aquired taste. I love Braunschweiger but that doesn't mean I'd recommend it to everyone. The PB&J burger SOUNDED intriguing, but it just did not work for him. He really didn't like it at all and neither did I (of course I tried it!). It was also incredibly messy.",

    "text": "A good burger is hard to find - Flannery O'Connor  Okay, O'Connor didn't say this. . . but if she had Rehab Burger then I am pretty sure literature would be a bit different.  A co-worker and I decided to give Rehab a try after I read a few reviews. One thing about me: burgers are something I crave, not necessarily a frequent on my to-eat list.  My friend ordered the Porkster and I ordered the Hangover.      1)  Each burger patty was seasoned to perfection.      2)  The chef understood what a medium burger should be and it was perfect     3)  The Porkster was great if you really enjoy meats. To be honest, I could have had             the pulled pork alone. The burger patty was just more awesome under a bun      4) The Hangover was devoured by my co-worker (we split our burger in halves and              shared) but I felt like something was missing. I would have preferred to have                 some sort of spicy...something on it . . .or a bit more cheese. Next time, I'll think               about the sauces they provide and request something different.        5) Order the sweet potato fries and make sure they give this white sauce to dip            'em. I am pretty sure that sauce is made from love and a dash of Heaven.  We arrived before the restaurant started pouring in with customers (around noon) so if you're wanting a quick in and out lunch, I am not so sure this is the place.  All around you get what you pay for. I couldn't finish half of my Rehab burger and had a lot of Tots left over. Go there and expect to be satisfied!",

What stands out even more than the food, in my opinion, is the service.  I can't recall having more genuinely friendly service.  John is awesome and made sure I was well taken care of during my visit; however, everyone in the vicinity greeted me warmly and chatted me up as I ate.  I appreciated that, as I dined alone at the bar.    The menu has a variety of items that sound tempting.  It is definitely worth a return visit.",

Our waitress came and was telling us since it was Sunday they were out of alot of stuff. Not a big deal. We ordered 2 appetizers and only received one. We didn't say anything figured food will be out soon so we'll just wait. WRONG! Don't get me wrong she was nice but slow as dirt! The place wasn't crowded at all. She never came to refill our drinks, the nice man that sat us down was the one checking on us. He even said good burgers but the customer service was crap.

    "text": "As far as California surf town joints go, I am a fan!  This location creates the complete surf town ambiance with its beach cruisers, surf boards, and flat panels with aquariums and beach scenes.  You can expect to find bar food here such as chicken wings and chili cheese fries.  And of course there are the burgers.  You can choose from about a dozen burgers, as well as the ability to build your own.  You also have the option of a \"rehab\" and \"relapse\" size.  The smaller of the two, happens to be the perfect size and portion.  Rehab offers a variety of unique dipping sauces, such as their pineapple aoli, chipotle ranch, habanero ketchup, sweet habanero, and their stone ground mustard.  The pineapple aoli is perfect with the sweet potato tots, the mustard outstanding with the burgers because it has a very mellow sweet and tart flavor.  I ordered my burger medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection.  Despite the restaurant being quite busy, food and drink orders were delivered very quickly.  All food tasted fresh and made to order, and temperatures of the cooked foods were perfect.  There were other options on the menu such as sandwiches and pasta, even smaller portions for kiddos - but this definitely is a burger joint.  With the average burger costing $7.50 for a small and $10.50 for a larger version, the prices are very competitive with other burger joints.  This place can become your local hangout with weekly specials such as thirsty Thursdays where domestic pints are $2 and premiums are $3 as well as $4 drink specials and a dollar off on appetizers.  Furthermore, Happy Hour is 7 days week, until 6p.  You don't get huge savings on the appetizers, but you can definitely drink on a budget here.",

Every server we've ever had was excellent and attentive.  I've tried a variety of items of the menu:  * Hawaiian Burger  - It was tasty, but the slab of Ham on the burger was a bit much for me. Personal preference thing.  * Veggie Noogie Sammy - I incorrectly thought this would be similar to Oregano's Veggie Wedgie. It is not, but that doesn't mean it isn't good.   * Shelby's Shpinach Salad - This is my favorite with or without the grilled chicken breast on top. I love that you can get the mini size of this salad w/o chicken for only $5. It is a steal!  I've also tried the onion rings, french fries, and sweet potato tots. The tots are where it is at!  Most everything on the menu comes in two sizes - Rehab (small) and Relapse (huge). Even the small size is really big if you don't normally eat big portions. Be forewarned!",

Got part of my order wrong but i didn't mention that as it was only the bread and I didn't care. Was very warm and dark inside. Temperature outside was 110 so the AC might have been strained. Hard to find home made veggie burgers so for that reason I would go back if i were in the area. Server was great and did not hover. Fun place to go in cooler weather to sit on patio. We got there early so there was no wait, but by the time we left, the line was out the door. Not sure it would be worth the wait but it was definitely good enough to try again.",

As I was people watching, I noticed tables coming in. I also noticed table by table, food was coming out for them before ours. Shortly after we ordered our second round of drinks smoke did fill the small restaurant and we made jokes about our food being on fire, so we chalked it up to our order actually being the cause of the smoke. It was a late lunch so by this time it was past well past 1 p.m. Our server cruised by and said we were waiting on the wings one of us ordered.  Finally the food arrived and it couldn't have been the wings, since they were cold. Both burgers had burned pretzel buns, and one side of tots was half a serving of cold tots. The server said he would bring more, then never returned. The restaurant was quite busy, so we took matter in our own hands and asked someone to bring the tots and fill our drinks, but the burgers weren't great. We ate them anyway because at this point we were just so hungry!  Finally we were waiting for our check to be split and who I assumed is the manager came by our table and asked how it was. We were honest and told him it wasn't great. He arrogantly replied \"Not great? But you ate all your food\" I looked at him and said \"Yeah because I waited a long time for my food while all these tables who came in after us were served their meals\" It was ridiculous, I watched many of those tables leave as well while we were dealing with our tab.   He pressed the issue, even though we didn't want to get into it because a) it seemed petty and b) we just wanted to leave, but he insisted . We told him our issues with the meal and 10 min later he returned with the food removed off the menu. The weirdest thing was his delivery. He pinned the checks on the table facing us so we could read it, and goes, \"How are we doing this\" holding our cards in his hand. I  pointed to my check and said \"I'm the blue card, so that's mine\" He just stared at me. I repeated, \"I'm the blue card\" and reached over to pull the card out of his grip, and he goes, \"Okay, so the $2 on the blue card and the $6 on the red card\"   It was sooo rude. His demeanor was that we were being ungrateful, when we honestly just wanted to leave. When he returned he was full of excuses, (we're a new restaurant, we are very busy, etc.) which is FINE. I eat out all the time, and new restaurants all the time, and I expect growing pains, so I told him I liked the place, I would be back to watch a game, grab a drink. He replied, \"Well we are not a bar with good food. We are a restaurant with good drinks.\"   What the hell? First of all, I wasn't even drinking, so I was just trying to be NICE. Thanks for not taking our constructive criticism YOU ASKED FOR then making us feel BAD about the discount you gave us that we weren't looking for. It was such a turn off, we talked about it the whole ride home and all day I've been telling people what a nightmare it was when they asked me about it due to me checking in on social media  So I lied to the manager... I won't be back. There are plenty of other mediocre burger shops around town that I can give my business to, and if I do end up there again, I'll be ordering the wings and tots. Their burgers are average. For a place with BURGER in the name, there is just absolutely nothing special about their signature menu item. Shoulda gone to In N Out.",

    "text": "Not impressed. I ordered the turkey burger - which I guess, who does that at a burger joint - but I was looking for something semi-healthy, and a good turkey burger done right is pretty good! This patty was rubbery, garbage meat from Frozen Foods of America straight off the truck. To cover it up, they used a pound of shredded cafeteria iceberg lettuce. Woof. Although the portions are big, I'd rather have smaller, better quality. In addition to the crappy food, we had a crappy service. We were a party of 8, so larger table and I get that. But it took an hour (literally) for the server to take our order- after I had to go tell the hostess we were ready to order (also, they weren't busy on a Tuesday night at 7pm). And it took an hour (literally) for our food to come to the table. The atmosphere is fun, and the menu items sounded good, but I don't know that I'd go back. Not even to try the PB&J burger!",

If you check in on yelp you can get chips & salsa for $3.99. The salsa was spicy. Not the greatest chips & salsa.   I also got onion rings and they are pretty huge, I think there's about 9 pieces. They were okay. Also we got 2 order of wings with 12 pieces medium style. The wings were amazing! They were huge & delicious! Also it comes with carrots.   We mostly got build your own burger. They put the mayo, mustard & bacon on the side so you need to put it on yourself. The burgers you can choose 5oz(relapse) or 10oz(rehab). I got the 5oz and it's pretty thick. Also don't forget to add cheese, it's really good and delicious. They also have sweet potato tater tots or fries to choose from. Also you get to choose your bun either white, wheat, pretzel bun or lettuce wrap.",

    "text": "We arrived around 7:00 p.m. on a Saturday evening to an understandably very busy restaurant.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table for three, which we thought was acceptable.  We were seated on the patio, which was okay for a couple of minutes.  There is a large \"waiting for a table\" area on the patio that became a major pain for us.  The first large group to invade our space was a posse of drunk young ladies.  They were loud, obnoxious, and annoying.  They finally move on after 15-20 minutes.  We greatly enjoyed the next three minutes without big mouths.  Next up is a large group of rather intense individuals who made the inebriated girls look like a group of librarians.  At least 30+ minutes of this pretty much ruined our meal as well as many others on the patio.  Obvious suggestion to this establishment's management: get this waiting area off the patio where people are trying to dine.  People who are hungry and are waiting on a table are oil and water with people who are trying to enjoy their food.  Our waitress, who may have been the best waitress I have had (no kidding) shows up promptly and takes our order.  We go with the following items: -Chips and salsa.  Ssssoooo very, very good.  The seasoning on the chips was killer. -My wife had a turkey burger that was similar to a Big Mac, I believe it was called the \"Mac Gnarly Burger\".  She didn't find it \"gnarly\" at all, and stated it was just okay.  She also had sweet potato tater tots, which she absolutely loved and a margarita which she thought was solid. -I wasn't very hungry and just had some chili cheese fries, which were about what you would expect (just average). -My son had the Spicy Mac-N-Cheese burger (he was a fan).  The burger had pepper jack cheese, mac-n-cheese, several different peppers, and bacon.    The restaurant felt very touristy to me, which I didn't care for.  The food was a mixed bag - some very good, some very average.  Our waitress was the high point of our meal, and damned if I can't remember her name.  She deserves a serious shoutout that I am unable to provide (what a loser I am).  Not a terrible experience, but not a place I would visit again when in the area this coming winter.  As packed as they were, and all the stellar Yelp reviews, I'm sure they will get along just fine with my $50.  Worth checking out if you are in the area.",

My husband and I are hooked on the pig wings - small, meaty riblets with yummy sauce.  Makes a great appetizer when you are hungry.   I love that they offer two size patties for your burger. I got the big patty on the Backyard bbq burger and shared with my sister. The variety of burgers is amazing and you can customize anything. I love their pretzel buns, sweet potato tots, and sauces!   They know how to prepare burgers, but their sandwiches and salads are fabulous!  And tots - you must get the tots!",

We were told to wait or go to the bar. Since we didn't feel like waiting we ended up sitting at the bar.  Once seated we tried the following:  * spicy Mac n cheese burger - definitely a burger I haven't tried before, and I liked it. The interesting thing about this burger was the Mac n cheese which I noticed wasn't made of the normal cheddar cheese but more like a jalapeno cheddar cheese  * poblano burger - if you like a kick of spicy but not something TOO spicy then this is a burger that's good for you! Overall I enjoyed this burger thoroughly. This dish came with a side of the sweet potato tots and gosh those were amazing!!  * Beer - I cant remember which beer we got but it was one of the four peaks one. Also really enjoyed this as well!  Overall good place to grab some burgers",

It's super tasty but it's the kind of burger you have to eat with a fork and knife, lol (not a problem for me).   The reason I'm giving the Scottsdale location 4 stars is because EVERY time we've ever gone it seems like they have the AC set to 85 degrees or maybe it's off completely. There's fans but I don't think they do anything other than look good. To me, the environment in which I'm eating has to be comfortable and this one is VERY warm. It's pretty annoying trying to eat a hot meal and feeling all sweaty at the same time.",

Highly recommend if you like peanut butter and meat. If you've not tried the combo but meet the aforementioned sentence requirement, do it.   I got the hangover burger and it was ok. Definitely yummy but nothing mind blowing. If I'm not getting the PB &J burger, I wanna try the Mac n cheese burger! This place has got a lot going on, making it a fun place to come back to!

    "text": "Food was DELICIOUS and price was definitely reasonable. My only complaint is on the employees.  Immediately after making our orders, we wanted to make one adjustment and so I approached the cashiers area which had like 4 girls working and asked them that I need to make an adjustment to an order that was already made. None of these 4 employees offered to help me or even asked what my request was which was so small and could've been so quickly and easily. Instead, one of them said she would go find my waiter. 10 minutes after, I approached the same woman again and asked if anyone was going to help us and verbally explained to her that I'm hoping to make this adjustment before our orders are already completed for both our and the kitchen's convenience. Without any drop of consideration, she rishingly said \"Yeah, he's coming.\" Another 10 minutes later, we see our waiter finally coming out with our PREPARED ORDERS. I questioned whether he was told that I requested to make an adjustment and he said no one told him anything. I was so thrown off. Even though this guys was nice and approachable, he himself did not show any understanding or apology for his coworker who lied to us and made us wait for no reason. Instead, he nonchalantly said he will be back with the adjusted order, which only made us wait longer and made the rest of our food get colder. Afterwards, we both realized that our orders were made incorrectly - they had out incorrect toppings in our burgers. When we brought this to his attention, he simply got a side of the correct tipping and put it in a sauce cup for us. This was just annoying because it resulted in us fingering the wrong toppings out of our already prepared burgers, then refilling them with the right ones that were later given us a side instead. Definitely didn't pay to do that and neither were WE getting paid to do these workers' jobs. It sucks that at restaurants where food is so great, you actually end up having a negative experience because of the poor customer service provided by employees representing these places.",

I dunno. As a 35 year old who has had good food, this place did not live up to the hype. First off it is hot inside. We were outside under the misters and I believe it felt better than inside. I was about to order philly cheese fries until I read they had cheez whiz on top. Ummm ok, gross. Splurge and buy real cheese people. Way to ruin a philly cheese anything. Then the waitress tried to carry 6 drinks in her hands and almost dumped a Coke in my lap. Thank god for good reflexes I was able to catch it. I got a BLT and fries. The bread was spongy and the bacon chewy. The fries were cold and the seasoning was lime and salt? I dunno. My husband got a burger and onion rings. The rings were cold. He asked for a chilled glass for his beer and it was barely cool. So warm beer. Not impressed. Save your money if you actually like good food. If you are in your 20s and like the bar scene and bar food this will be your thing.",

We were seated the moment we walked in the door and our waiter (oh I wish I got his name!) gave us the rundown of the menu since it was our first time there. Crowd favorite: PB & J, his personal favorite: spicy mac n cheese. I love that he offered up his recommendations so of course, I went for the spicy mac n cheese, with sweet potato tots and say what, it comes with a fancy sauce too? I couldn't decide for the life of me, so he offered to give me three different sauces, which was greatly appreciated. The hubby got the bigger beefstro and fries and I believe, chipotle ranch.  Both burgers were phenomenal, cooked to a juicy medium. Not to be biased, I preferred my spicy mac n cheese. Let's be realistic here, this burger is overflowing with mac n cheese and unless you're some sort of burger magician (what am I saying) you're not going to get any mac n cheese on that burger. So dig in with that fork and eat up all that mac n cheese. It was so cheesy, and this is an understatement, but I am a fan of cheese, so this was right up my alley. I was really hungry going in, and as much as I wanted to wolf down my burger, I had to stop myself and just savor each bite. It was that good.  I'm just going to stop myself there, I'm getting too hungry thinking about it to continue. But a word of advice: Get yourself that spicy mac n cheese burger, and no sharing!",

I've had just the mac and cheese and the mac and cheese burger, and I think the burger is the way to go.

They are very efficient and fast paced and yes I'm sure they get lost in the weed sometimes but I've been here twice and I've had a great time both times.  The first burger I ordered was the gnarly burger and I guess it could be best described as your regular ordinary double Dekker burger but it's huge. Next I ordered the spicy macaroni and cheese burger it was smaller than the gnarly burger but it was very good, and you get macaroni and cheese all over the place and it's actually tasty macaroni and cheese.

Our service was fine and food quality was fine, but it was mostly just that - fine. The burgers and toppings were average. The fries were average. I'd say the most fun I had was with their sauces! The sweet potato tots tasted great with all three that I tried (pesto mayo, teriyaki and chipotle ranch).   Again, definitely not a bad place at all. It was laid back and is probably a great place to meet friends",

For seating, there's a small bar area as well as both inside and outside seating.   A friend and I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger Relapse size (4oz of meat) on a traditional Brioche bun with a side of fries and an order of their Onion Ring appetizer. The burger was just alright, nothing spectacular. BUT their onion rings were so good and massive too. The beer batter makes for an extra thick and crispy crunch. It comes with a yummy chipotle ranch sauce for dipping. Yum!   As for service, our waitress was nice but a little slow in checking up on us periodically, so it took a little longer than expected to get our check and pay. This didn't bother me though because I assumed service would match the informal, laid-back atmosphere Rehab is going for.   Overall, OK experience. I might come back for a beer and their onion rings but probably not to have a full meal.",

I think this place depends on its toppings to provide flavor, and they aren't wrong, but I really prefer it when I can't get enough of the meat itself.  The sweet potato taters were just okay- I'd stick to the fries next time.  All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way for this place but I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again.  Its a cute place to hang out too and the wait/bar staff were really nice!",

The food was amazing. We were celebrating a birthday as a group of 7. The staff provided us with service that would make you think you were in a 5 star restaurant. The menu was diverse enough for everyone to choose something that appeals to their tastes and from the chicken wings to the sweet potato tots to the burger itself everything was done perfectly. I had the BYOB burger. I added avocado, havarti cheese, and a fried egg. It was delicious. To the staff at Rehab thank you for treating us like kings. Thank you for the excellent service (especially during the Friday night dinner rush no less) and thanks for the burger therapy!",

My husband had the 'pig wings' which were pork riblets that he said were amazing. They were tender, almost fell off the bone tender and the sauce was incredible--sweet with a bit of heat on the backside.   I was extremely please to find a burger joint with gluten free buns!  My first time ever--usually have to order protein style. Kudos for this wise choice!  I ordered the hatch burger but with a turkey burger instead of beef with the Jamaican style corn on the cob. The flavored were absolutely fabulous. But that heat on the chile...wow, I need ice cream!    We are planning a return trip before we go home.  I highly recommend this place. Great for our picky teenagers as well!",

The burger was plenty spicy and I enjoyed it, however, the burger was not well done as I requested. There was some link in the burger and the fries were cold. Aside from that it was a great experience, although I anticipate Wait staff to be a little more attentive and bring out hot sides. I personally  convinced a friend of mine to come and he was pleased except for the service. Gentlemen serving us seemed complacent or Like he was ready to go. I understand as we've all been there, although if you want to attract repeat customers you have to show them attention. Just a thought....",

    "text": "The. Best. Burger. I've ever had. In. My. LIFE! The boyfriend and I were in Phoenix for a vacation over Memorial Day weekend. Burgers are our thing so I looked into what Arizona had to offer. I came across Rehab on Yelp and saw it was the highest rated place around us -- of course we decided to come.  We sat outside on the patio, it has a laid back and welcoming ambiance. For starters, we ordered the Chili Con Fritos and Nelson's Verde Con Pollo. Both to die for! The Chili Con Fritos is a dream for anyone experiencing an oh-so-unfortunate hangover. Nelson's Verde Con Pollo is SPICY! But the flavor that comes with it is well worth it!  I ordered the Spicy Mac & Cheese burger on a brioche bun. I forget the name of my boyfriend's burger but in addition to the 10-ounce beef patty, it was topped with shaved rib-eye and a wasabi ranch dressing. He ordered his burger on the pretzel bun. And as I mentioned before, both burgers came with a 10-ounce beefy patty. You can choose a 5-ounce patty, \"the relapse\" if you prefer a smaller portion.  As soon as I took a bite of my burger, I looked at my boyfriend and said \"This is the best burger I've ever had in my life.\" Something I never thought I'd say, just because I eat so many burgers! But man, this burger had everything. The flavor, the texture, the crunch, the bursting spice of the poblano peppers --- I couldn't ask for more!  Each burger comes with a side --- sweet potato tots or fries are included in the burger price. You can upgrade to various other options if you wish. I chose the sweet potato tots and I am SO GLAD I did. I also had the pesto aioli and chipotle aioli for dipping. They tasted best dipped in the pesto aioli...or maybe the chipotle aioli...I can't decide! It was all just so good!  We topped off the night with the Pot Brownie. It was made with both Hershey's chocolate and Reese's peanut butter cups, topped with marshmallow fluff and ice cream. Oh my goodness. Who came up with this?! Genius, I tell you.  Later on that night, as I was doing my own random burger research (yes, that's how much I love burgers) I came across an article that listed the best burger joint in every state in America. Funny enough, Rehab was the best in Arizona. :)  Needless to say... I WILL BE BACK! I will refer anyone and everyone, and I will gladly speak HIGHLY about my experience at Rehab.",

Another of our diners did not get the avocado on her build your own burger and had an extremely long wait for her drink.  A third diner received her French fries ice cold.  She did get some that were nice and hot but that took over 15 minutes to receive.  I'm not sure what was going on last night that contributed to so many errors being made.

The rather small space made for an awkward wait in the door way... But the hostess was insanely friendly and answered any questions we had while waiting.   There were 3 different meals ordered. First mine was the PB&J bacon burger with sweet potato tots. I have to say that the tots were awesome, and dipped in their teriyaki pineapple aoli made them a perfect side. I highly recommend that combo. The burger was delicious. Sweet, spicy, salty & nutty. I personally loved it... But I know not all will step out of their box for this kind of burger. It was juicy and messy just like a burger should be. I ordered the small which was a 5oz patty and couldn't even eat half. The Ghost burger (10oz) & regular fries were yummy... The best part about the Ghost burger was the generous melted gooey cheese & avocado. I don't know what sorcery they used to make the huge burger stay together & stacked when eating.. But that was great. The fries good, but nothing special in my opinion. The last meal a large Mac Gnarly burger and Jamaican corn. The corn was delicious... But for me it needed more of the seasoning blend & salt. The burger had a great 1000 island dressing, messy, delicious.. And again stayed together very well for a huge burger.   I'm definitely going back and if you're looking for a great burger check them out.",

During the first visit we were largely ignored by the server - he only stopped by our table after we had been sitting there for 10 minutes, didn't check on us after food was delivered, didn't refill our drinks, and only came back to drop the check.  The fries came out cold so we had to flag down another server to get fresh fries.  To their credit the manager/owner ended up comping the meal for us.  She asked that we give them another try to correct their shortcomings.  The second visit the fries came out cold again (I even tried a fry right when the plate hit the table).  The same manager replaced the fries for us, but again this server didn't check on how we were doing after the food was delivered.  The burgers themselves were okay, but for the price I expected something special.  I've had better at other burger joints in the area.  Burgers: 6/10 Fries: 3/10 Service: 3/10  I wanted to like this place because of all the other positive reviews, but I can't say that I'll be back.",

Burger was perfectly cooked.  Good bread that doesn't fall apart when you start grabbing your sandwich.  I think I've eaten most of their beef burgers except the PBJ (Peanut Butter and Jelly) burger.  PBJ on a burger doesn't really thrill me, but I've heard it's really popular.  My haircutter had the Hawaiian Burger and she loved it, but I think she would loved anything after finishing off three frozen margaritas.

We bombarded this place bathing suits, pool hair, and flip flops and fit in like they made the place for us.  Super laid back, beachy, bicycle on the boardwalk feel.  Absolutely opposite of what we are used to in Scottsdale, thank you for the breath of fresh air....literally.....great open air feel with patio a patio as well.  This place was busy so accommodating 6 may have not been easy, but the owner made it happen. ( The owner alone deserves  5 stars) alright enough gushing... The Food!!!!  We ordered the chili con Fritos appetizer Fritos smothered in just spicy enough chili with cheese and sour cream...terrific! Rodrigo Da Vinci salad~ zesty and creamy with huge chunks of Chicken.  Peppers onions, jalapenos!  Enough for all 6 to share  The tractor pull burger ~burger was cooked perfect medium and the Pulled pork on top was fall apart and rich with BBQ goodness. The PB&J Burger~ Ummmmm.. Go try this, I don't want to ruin the movie by telling you the best parts! The McGnarly~ burger cooked perfect again, it is along the lines of a Big Mac.....yet so deliciously done right. The Tuna fish sandwich~ the tuna salad was loaded with celery and onions.  It was fresh and cold and literally stood a foot high! It was a masterpiece made by cooks who show they care about what comes to your table!  I'm not usually this long winded, but if only one person sees how right these people have got it because they've read my babblings than hooray!",

As extreme food fans, we're always looking for a good burger with a twist, and we found it at Rehab Burger Therapy. We ordered the server's recommendation, which is their 'hangover burger', and we customized it.  This burger has a fried egg, bacon, colby jack cheese and a hatch green chili. We customized it to include their ghost pepper jack cheese and crispy onions with a side of hot sauce - and it was simply fantastic. No hot sauce was needed, the burger stood on it's own merits. :-)  Instead of ordering standard french fries, we opted for the Jamaican Corn, and WOW - phenomenal! I could order that every day. Our server told us that their Jamaican corn (which is a Jamaican-spiced corn-on-the-cob) is deep fried - and cooked this way, it was perfectly done, juicy and perfectly spiced. We've never had fried corn before, but it was definitely some of the best corn we've ever had.  Try their corn at least once when you visit - you will not be disappointed. And the burgers? You can't go wrong! Loved it!",

    "text": "First off, my burger and tater tots were great. I got the large Porkster burger which is a hamburger patty topped with BBQ pulled pork - 10oz of meat overall. It came with cheese on a brioche bun and I could only finish half! The sweet potato tater tots were a nice side, especially with the pineapple terriyaki aioli sauce for dip. No complaints here!  My 10oz burger with tots, mom's 5oz burger with tots, and a lemonade came to just under $30.   However, had a big disappointment with the lunch time service. Our server was nice but way too much of a space case. He was really attentive until we got our food and then went MIA as the lunch hour started to pick up. Never got another refill on my drink, had to grab the usher for a to-go box, and when we finally got his attention after waiting for a bit we asked for the check and to try out the dessert (\"Pot\" brownie). Instead of dessert, we just got our check (sans dessert listed, with no mention of said dessert) so we just paid and left. Ain't nobody got time for that!",

It was crowded, and there was a wait, but they were extremely accurate with their estimate, and we were able to walk around Old Town a little bit before we were seated.  Our server was wonderful - that perfect combination of chatty and unobtrusive, helpful and not annoying.  We started with chips and salsa as something to snack on, and they were good. I loved that there were two sizes of burgers to account for all appetites. I ended up having the chili cheeseburger with fries. It was actually not so messy that I couldn't pick it up and eat it on the bun - a rare feat for a chili cheeseburger.  The beer was cold, the food was good, and despite the crowd, we never felt hurried or neglected. Rehab is definitely worth a revisit the next time I'm in the area.",

It also has sriracha, and I was hesitant to get it at first because it sounds absolutely gross, but you will be super surprised to discover how the flavors combine to create something amazing/incredible/mindblowing. I would have enjoyed just peanut butter on the burger, but the sriracha is a surprising balance to the sweetness of the grape jelly. I went with my family to Rehab Burger, and everybody else said my burger was better than theirs. I'm so happy I got it and I will be recommending it to everyone I know! I got it with a side of sweet potato tater tots, which by itself is enough for a second visit. The only thing I was disappointed with was the soggy onion rings but everything about the meal was worth it! I understand now why it was 45 minute wait.",

I went with their award winning PB&J burger. It's well worth the \"risk\". It was outstanding as were the sweet potato tots I got with it. They also have a great cocktail menu and a decent selection of beers. I would definitely hit this place frequently if I was a Scottsdale local.",

(It wasn't lunch or dinner time, i think it was around 3pm on Sunday).  After perhaps 5-7 mins wait, our table \"became\" available... but it seemed that particular table was available from the moment we walked in..  This place was very busy and slow service was expected.  When our server spilled a drink, she said \"that's why I brought extra napkins...\"    If you check in on yelp, it's $3.99 for chips and salsa.  Chips were thick and I wondered if these were homemade at this restaurant.  I ordered mimosa with cranberry juice. Never had one before and I thought I would try it. I think I prefer one with orange juice.  Now I know..  The burger I ordered was very big, I ate about 1/3 of it and couldn't eat anymore.  Very huge. Perhaps I wasn't that hungry, but I thought I had better burgers before.  Perhaps it was a bad day for me.",

We ordered the chips and salsa which came to us as a thicker tortilla chip and a sweet salsa that complimented well.  We ordered the Porkster and the Bacon Cheeseburger both Relapse sized. I ate the pulled pork first thinking I could eat the burger next, but I was foolish! Add the sweet potato tots to that mess and I was so full there was little room for breathing.  Also keep in mind that Relapse size is still as big as your face, so order wise. Also a good time to go to RBT is in between the dinner and lunch rush. Even though the place serves the biggest burgers, the actual established is small. Lines form fast and in a blink.  We had great service and I also recommend the pretzel bun, just because I can and because it was delicious.",

The Serrano vinegarette was hands down the best vinegarette I've ever had. Gonna stalk you to get the recipe. The burger, although we were missing the wasabi mayo due to being bun less I assume, was hands down best burger my husband has ever had. And this guy is picky! I had the wings, which I always order and seldom like, tasted fresh and juicy. All in all I would definitely come back and recommend to friends. Great job Rehab Burger!",

    "text": "I've been to rehab burger therapy several times and enjoyed it. I've even recommended people go there. It isn't the best burger in town but it's okay.  We had family plans to go last night and made a reservation a week in advance because there were going to be 8+ of us and I know how busy it would be on a Saturday.  When we arrived at the time of our reservation, we were told we hadn't made a reservation. When my mother persisted that we had made a reservation a week in advance she was yelled at the night manager and told that they only had one reservation that night and that it was filled.   ... He was extremely aggressive, condescending and frankly ridiculously rude... he didn't even take the time to actually check the reservations...   ... when he did, he discovered that we actually did have a reservation and came out trying to apologize for the wait... offering no explanation.   Turns out they had given our reservation out to another group and when he (night manager) found out about it, he yelled at the waitress who had made the mistake.   Listen, mistakes are made... that's easy to forgive.   ... But there is NO excuse for the way we were treated and particularly the way my mother was treated my the manager.   They did hustle to accommodate us and gave us free appetizers as an apology for the wait... unfortunately the damage was done.  I'll now actively not recommend burger rehab therapy and certainly won't go back.",

It was extremely messy and difficult to eat due to the thickly sliced pickles, but cutting it up made it easier to handle.  Some little sweet potato tots came with my burger and I also ordered a side of onion rings.  The onion rings were in my top 5.  No complaints there.  They automatically bring you ketchup, ranch, and a chipotle sauce for dipping.  Way to be on the ball, Rehab.  The sweet potato tots came with a yummy pineapple concoction for dipping.  It was good at first, but quickly became too sweet and I had to abandon it for the ranch and ketchup.  Everything was really good.  I would definitely go back.  Even their female employees were easy on the eyes.  Apparently, they are allowed to wear tight, revealing clothing to work.  Again, no complaints there.  In sum, go to Rehab if you like cute girls and awesome burgers.",

It was already buzzing with hungry rehabers. Wait time was only 15 minutes and we were seated at a communal table bench which is always fun!  We ordered calamari and mac n' cheese to start. The calamari was very heavily breaded, almost like fried fish sticks, but our friend loved them. The rehab sized mac n' cheese was delicious, but we could not even finish half of it between 3 people. I can't even imagine how big the relapse size is. I split a pretzel bun Hangover Burger and just half was a nice hearty and heavy meal for one. But because the slab of meat is thick, the inside wasn't as juicy as I hoped it would be. French fries and the tots were pretty standard. Overall, a pretty decent experience.   If you're hungry, Rehab Burger Therapy will definitely get the job done! :)",

Since I know on of the managers here, this was my suggestion.  Love the kitschy beach theme and that there were tables long enough for our whole group.  Everyone at our table tried something different, and thankfully there was something for everyone. The swimmers got their salads, the southern girls got their chicken sandwiches, and I got my ever holy PBJ & Bacon burger. Seriously, dont knock it til you try it. Im from MA, so I grew up eating peanut butter on burgers, but with jelly? And BACON?! I had to have it. Ah-mazing. Messy, but amazing.The sriracha is a nice touch too. It cuts through the sweetness of the grape jelly.  I highly recommend stopping in here. Thank for having us , Dave!",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place!  Very relaxed atmosphere. Surfer vibe but always full.  Price a little high for burger and fries but they aren't a little flimsy patty on a normal sesame bun.  I get the small 5 oz patty but they do have a 10 oz. omg!  Different bun choices like pretzel which really give it a unique flavor.  Never been let down but today we got the large \"gnarly\". Which is all u want to say! It's a Big Mac on steroids!  The most delicious burger I've had here but so big couldn't fit it in my mouth!  Yum.  I was thinking about giving this a 4 star simply bc the service was just mediocre   But the food is really why we go and that deserves a 6!",

It was so so delicious tho, i had the regular fries with it. My fiance had the BBQ Burger, we ordered the smaller one and that was still a big burger also. He said it was very good also and had regular fries with his. The place was so Cali surfs up style but clean. Everyone was nice we were greeted as soon as we walked in.  Im hoping to go today since i have to drop off my rental car in Scottsdale. Im really wanting to check out the PB&J bacon burger i have been hearing so much about and jalapeno popper burger. This time ill try the sweet potatoe tots. I will be doing another review for the other burgers if i end up that way today.",

    "text": "Stopped by Rehab on a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty busy but after a short wait we managed to snag a good spot on the patio.  I really liked the big selection of burgers and toppings possibilities that they offered. I ended up doing a BYOB (Build Your Own Burger) with cheddar, lettuce, tomato and thousand island dressing on a pretzel bun, along with the sweet potato fries. My boyfriend got the mac and cheese burger without the hot peppers and regular fries.  Our orders came out quickly. Mine came out with regular fries and when I mentioned that I had ordered the tots they brought me the tots with no hassle at all.  The burgers are big, even the smaller size. But they were very flavorful and the ingredients were fresh. The bun was nice and soft too - good bun to burger ratio.   The mac and cheese on the burger was a fun combo. They really load it on! And the tots and fries were good too.   Overall it's a lot of food, a cool laid back vibe and solid burgers for sure.",

Having tasted many great burgers over the years, I have very high expectations, and I can honestly say, they were met with flying colors!  First, the service was absolutely pleasurable. Our server was super chill, nice guy and did not bug us every five minutes. He was friendly and helpful.  The food: I tried the PBJ and Bacon burger after some hesitation and man, it was a real great treat! I think everyone should be adventurous enough to give this one a try...be dangerous and live a little! Sweet and spicy, the peanut butter jelly and chili really had a surprising twist - a very much BBQ like taste...very delicious. Instant favorite. I had a bite of my friend's cheese burger and it was great, but of course not as adventurous as mine haha!  The sweet potato and skin-on fries were both delicious, rounding out for a great epic burger dinner. Will definitely be back!",

We put in our order and sat and waited for over 45 minutes for our food. While we sat there waiting... And waiting... And waiting... We watched as table after table who ordered after we had get their food. She also came by and tried to force another beer on me. She then brought my friend his burger, then went to check on the table next to us while the rest of us sat there for another 5 minutes waiting on our food. My friend told her just to cancel his order (I believe he has also written a review). The burger was good... But would have been way better had I gotten it about 25 minutes earlier than I actually did.  I forget my servers name, but she was an older woman, a lot older than the other waitresses there. P.S.

We had the Hawaiian burger  and the Bacon cheese burger, fries and the sweet poToTos. all of their Aioli sauces served with the burgers and sides were really tasty. Did i mention how great the staff was? We gave it 12 stars and will be going back for more!!!!!! I recommend it to any one.",

Our server was very bubbly and explained every aspect of the restaurant and menu to us. I was incredibly impressed. We all order our food. I got the Rehab BBQ burger (11 oz) and our server recommended the pretzel bun. Food came out quickly and it was soooo good. Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. They also had a bunch of awesome dipping sauces and another bottled sauce that's to die for. Everyone I was with loved their food. I was only able to finish half my burger, and I have a big appetite. The fries were great too. It's so nice to find a nicely priced restaurant and bar in Old Town that also has great service and great food. I've already brought friends in again to try it out and they loved it too. Can't wait to go back.",

Even though the night we went there was a big group of people having fun too and it was a little loud at times, we were still taken care of. I saw all ages there.  Burgers are GOOD and could SHARE, but why would you want to??  David our server was absolutely great, especially for us newbies to Rehab. I had the BBQ burger with wheat bun, another had the Mushroom with pretzel bun. The \"outlier\" had fish tacos, which to them were just okay.  I prefer the wheat and it was great but I did try the pretzel bun and it was good.  Everyone LOVED LOVED LOVED the sweet potato tater tots!!! I was quite full after eating just the burger.  One tip I have to share is there are 2 types of burges, the regular sized rehab and the smaller \"relapse\". The bun comes in one size (the big rehab size) so the relapse can look kinda odd being small on a huge bun.  Parking is, I agree, kinda weird, but you still gotta go here!  All in all, the burgers, atmosphere and busy yet attentive waitstaff are worth it. I would definitely go back!",

    "text": "Nice location. We enjoyed sitting on the patio.  Our burgers were cooked to our liking ( well done). My friend got the burger with peanut butter and jelly and said it was delicious. It sure looked good!   My main reason for writing this review is for others with celiacs disease- I decided to try rehab burger after discovering that they had a gf bun and was able to access a list of their gluten free offerings online. I was excited to try! Unfortunately the waiter we had knew very very little about what was offered and that right off the bat made me nervous. All  he knew is that the burger patty wasn't spiced with anything with gluten in it. Otherwise I read off the online list- really the only options turned out to be the build a burger or salad.  I got the build your own burger...Fries were not gf so I subbed a side salad with my burger...after extensive conversation with the server the salad still came out with croutons on it :/ The burger was decent. Not something that would make me return in and of itself.  At the end of the meal and my salad was pushed to the side untouched the the server gave me a funny look then apparently realized that I ordered it without croutons. He was a nice enough guy so I just said don't worry about it (I was a little disappointed to see that he hadn't subtracted it from the bill however as it was an additional charge to have the salad instead or fries for a side).  Overall this seems like nice enough place, just not for those looking for gf options. It's curious to me that they offer a gf bun but are not very gf friendly otherwise.",

    "text": "Have been seeing posts online for a while, and have wanted to give the place a try.  Disappointed to drive from across town to find out their specialty burger has sold out the day before, sounds like poor planning to me.  Anyway, we had the PB&J, Spicy Mac and Cheese and the Calamari.  Wife really enjoyed the PB&J burger, I wasn't as impressed with the Spicy Mac & Cheese.  The mac had a gritty taste, and was served lukewarm, and not the least bit spicy.  The flavor wasn't bad, but it wasn't a $14 burger either.  The calamari was surprisingly good, which is funny because it would seem the burger should be the star and not the appetizer.   Two burgers and a appetizer for $38, to me seems a little steep, but I'm cheap.  Kicker to the whole visit is when I check my bank statement the next day, the upped the bill by $3.  I guess someone wanted a little larger tip than the 20% we paid.  Not sure it's worth driving across town to not get what you want, but I can now say I have been there.  UPDATE: After calling and speaking to the manager, the entire tip amount is being refunded as this was an error on the part of the server.",

Bugers were stellar, both the vegan and the Hatch Chile burger.  I grew up 30 miles north of Hatch NM and can say they did it right.    The Red Stripe beer was fresh!!!  Something you don't see on a regular basis here in AZ  The real surprise was the sweet potato tots!  Usually not a fan of them, but their version just made me a convert!!!

However, I think Rehab has staying power that would even keep Linsey Lohan here!  The patty and condiment combinations aren't that unique but the ingredients are fresh and the sauces are good enough to eat with a spoon. In fact, I really think it is the sauces that make the burgers here. I ordered a classic cheddar cheese burger which I know sounds boring but it was a great choice as it highlighted the yumminess of the chipotle aioli sauce. As many other reviewers have said, the \"sweet poTOTatos\" (sweet potato tater tots) are good but for me, it was once again the sauce, this time the pineapple teriyaki that made the dish.  This rehab center has patio seating complete with a zillion umbrellas, fans and misters. But vampires need not worry, as there is a great interior too that is dim and cool. Also, despite being a super casual place, the bathrooms were neat and nice.",

PROS: the best thing about the burgers was the quality beef--very tasty and just the right balance of lean/fat to make for an excellent flavor. Brioche bun was fresh and lightly toasted. Service was friendly and efficient.  CONS: for me, a good burger must be complimented w/ good french fries.  Regrettably, the spuds came to the table barely warm, and they sure didn't improve as the meal progressed. This cost a star from my rating . . . Side salad came to the table looking like it had been stacked under 5 other similar plates when it was pre-made several hours before. The cheese and croutons didn't help hide the \"pressed\" salad, nor did they inspire the bland taste.  I'd definitely return to Rehab . . . the burgers are worth it. However, I'll be sure to ask for fresh and hot fries . . .   Cheers! RS",

Crisp outside and moist inside.  The sauce was incredible with just enough heat.  Two person portion size.  For a burger I settled on the Spicy Mac-N-Cheese Burger at my son's recommendation.  I was not disappointed.  The homemade Mac with the peppers made the burger explode with flavor.  Very filling.  Go there now.",

But not a big deal.  Service was quick and friendly. Burgers are great. Big and juicy with your choice of different buns. The fires are good and plentiful. My wife like the sweet potato tots.  Get there early on the weekend as there is usually a line but it moves quick. Been here 8+  times and never disappointed. I like the McNarley burger. Be prepared, the Rehab burger is two patties, hugh and messy. Ask for extra napkins.",

The good: - decor is great - prices are reasonable - food is great (side note - I tried the Sriracha PB&J bacon burger.  Yep, you read that right.  It was ok.  I thought the PB took over the taste of the burger but it was definitely a different taste.  My wife loved her bacon cheese burger) - sweet potato tots are a refreshingly different option - tasty  The not so good: - I wouldn't say our server was overly attentive.  When she came by she was very friendly and attentive but she rarely came by.  I had finished my water (prob a 26oz cup) and waited for a while to get a refill.  Most other restaurants you barely get through 1/2 of your drink before a refill is offered.    The service wasn't a deal breaker and I would probably go back.  I think you should give it a try!",

So we came across Rehab Burger Therapy and we were sold since I had been wanting to try this place since its opened. The happy hour is pretty awesome, you can get domestic for $2 and premium beers for $3!! So we got a round of Blue Moons and I tried the Four Peak Peach ale while the fiance got the 8th street. OMG the peach ale was so good! We got hungry and decided to split a burger since we saw a bunch of appetizing looking burgers pass us to other tables. We agreed on trying the hatch chili burger and it was cooked perfectly. They had a lot of interesting sauces like spicy ketchup, teriyaki aoili and chipotle aoili. I smeared chipotle aoili on the burger and it was the perfect compliment to the charred taste of the burger. The fries were okay, we got half regular fries and half sweet potato tots. I will definitely return for more burgers, I am especially interested in trying their hangover burger since I love me some breakfast foods (it has a fried egg and bacon), and of course I'll be back for more happy hours!",

I ended up ordering the bacon cheeseburger on a brioche bun with jamaican corn. Definitely one of my top 5 burgers I ever had, the only regret is that I ordred a small patty instead of a large. (I felt that the bread to meat ratio was a little off.)  My friend ordered a swiss and mushroom burger on a pretzel bun.  The pretzel bun isn't really my thing, but tasted delicious otherwise. Would and will definitely come back here if I'm in town!!",

I wish I could say I was able to enjoy the food this time but after waiting 8 mins to get acknowledged by an employee( over 4 employees walked by and looked at me didn't say a word) I decided to just sit my self hoping a server would acknowledge me.  The server came up 4 mins later telling me I couldn't sit there and that there was a wait with 4 open tables in restaurant. The only wait was 2 people that were waiting behind me and never sat down. Once I asked for a manager they said I was fine to sit and she would return for my drink order.  8 MINUTES goes by and not one single employee comes to ask if we want a drink.  I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN. I can understand if it is busy but it was a Wednesday night with multiple open tables everywhere and no SPORTS playing.  I am 100% about customer service and this is the third time in a row I have had terrible service.",

Our server, Shawn, was friendly, funny, and very capable of dealing with a hungry crew of 10. The restaurant was packed so the service was a bit slow, but the food was worth the wait. We recommend the PBJ burger. I had the chicken sandwich which was excellent. Another friend said the Caesar salad was AWESOME. Lots of choices for even the most finicky of eaters. I wouldn't recommend it for the kids though. We bought our 3 year old and although the choices on the menu were ok for him, there is no kid menu. The restaurant is loud and raucous which is great for a night with friends, but not really for kids. Outside where we sat is mostly high tops so it's hard for kids to sit on chairs that high without worrying they are going to fall off. It's like constantly worrying about your drunk friend falling off the chair, except they aren't drunk..and is 3. LOL. Anyway, we are looking forward to going back for a grown-ups night soon! :)",

I explained to the waitress who wasn't very impressed and grudgingly bought me fresh fries. My burger was raw not medium ( before everyone shouts I eat blue steak) when I  explained this to my waitress she advised me that this is how they cooked their medium burgers and I should have been more specific on how I wanted my medium burger cooked!,,,, Really explain and be more specific!

I thoroughly enjoy a good burger. I was not particularly blown away from the meal. The French fries tasted like the oil needed to be changed in the fryer. In all fairness we didn't go out until 8pm at night: the burger was not bad just not something I was happy paying $14 bucks for. I'll attach some pics. We had the honey medium wings and they were better then the burger. The wings were not fatty, had plenty of meat on them, cooked perfectly, and tossed in a great flavor sauce. It's possible the wings set the bar too high. I chose the rehab hangover burger. This included, bacon, fried egg, 10oz patty, Colby cheese, chipotle mayo, and a very fresh flavorful hatch chili. The idea behind the burger was perfect. The execution was not there. The patty was cooked medium but had an over char to it, giving it a burnt taste, the fried egg was over cooked, I was really looking forward to bursting the yoke! The bacon was over cooked. The bun had good flavor but should have been toasted longer and was a bit tough like it had lost some of its freshness. The hatch chili had great flavor! Ultimately, I will go back on another day perhaps when it's slower to see if the execution is better. The servers and bartenders were polite and friendly.",

    "text": "Loved the beach-themed interior decor. Even on a busy, Fathers' Day lunch there was room at the bar and plenty of time to order. I absolutely loved what I saw on the menu; specialty burgers topped with mac and cheese, or peanut butter and jelly and all sorts of other crazy stuff that people must go wild for! Though we were apprehensive to try those ones, we did grab a BBQ/Onion Ring Burger and the Hatch Chile Burger (not sure if that's what they're actually called). The flavor was outstanding in both, but neither burger was cooked the way they were ordered. In fact, one of them was so dry it was difficult to eat. I am pretty confident that our overdone burger was an uncommon incident, so this place deserves a second chance. I'll certainly be back, and hope to dive deeper into the menu when I return.  Sunday was a memorable experience, for sure, however I wish we'd left the place with more in our stomachs than in the take-home containers.",

I was back in the area a few nights ago and decided to get dinner here with a friend after manicures. The super friendly server seated us and was very attentive throughout the meal. We didn't get any appetizers, but we both had the Backyard BBQ burger with regular fries. The restaurant has a very low-key relaxing vibe, my only (minor) complaint was that for a Wed night when it wasn't brimming, the music was pretty loud. We got our burgers and they were very good. I had the spicy ketchup and if you have your doubts, it is most certainly spicy, but I loved it. Since Old Town isn't really my scene I'm not sure how often I'll be back, but I'd definitely return.",

    "text": "Believe the hype, this place is 2 legit to quit! Went here New Years day, with my massive hangover in tow,  because LOLO's had a 45 min wait. Lucky for me we were sat immediately.  Our server was pleasant and quickly brought all our drinks. The most notable of drinks were the chocolate milk shake and bloody mary; both were exceptional.  Our table ordered a Poblano burger (relapse size), Hatch chili burger (turkey patty) and hangover (rehab).  All burgers came cooked to order and were A-mazing. I had the relapse size Poblano burger with onion rings and couldn't finish it so don't worry about not having enough food!  I had a bite of my husbands Hatch turkey burger that was equally as good! He said he didn't miss the beef one bit because the turkey burger was just as juicy and flavorful. If I had to complain it would be about the onion rings and lemon pepper on the fries.  The onion rings are thick with more batter than I prefer as I like a crispier onion ring that is more about the onion than batter.  The actual fries are great but they sprinkle lemon pepper on them. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  Both of these complaints are just a personal preferences and have nothing to do with the way they were cooked or quality of the food.  Next time I will just get the fries without the lemon pepper : ) I would love to see them add regular tots to the menu for those who are not a fan of sweet potato tots. All in all, it was a great meal and I will definitely go back.",

The location and atmosphere were fine and a chirpy waitress provided hope of a good experience when she suggested the day's special of some kind of thinly sliced tri-tip burger.  The outcome however was disappointing as I bit in to my first mouthful of gloopy bits of meat with what I think were peppers, causing a river of grease to descend on to my plate.  The whole thing tasted of something soaked in oil and when I informed the waitress she simply smiled and replied with 'yea', as though I was simply stating the obvious and that was the intended result.  If you're normally a healthy eater and feel like treating yourself to a burger, you might as well buy one from a roadside burger truck and save the disappointment.",

The food looks good in pictures and even in person but the taste is just ok... My husband got the Bosa burger (Bosa doughnuts as buns) the bottom doughnut was literally sitting in liquid when it arrived and as my husband picked it up it disintegrated in his hands. I got the burger with pulled pork on top and it was swimming in spicy bbq sauce which, if you like spicy bbq sauce probably would have been really good however, I don't like spicy food and it said nothing about it being spicy on the menu. If it did I wouldn't have ordered it. As the manager walked by and asked how everything was I explained that I didn't really like spicy food and was unable to really eat any of the burger she said \"Aw, I feel bad\" and walked away. So we paid $14 for 2 bites of a burger. I live in north Phoenix and would never drive all the way back to this place. It's not worth the time out of my day.",

It was again just ok. Nothing spectacular. Maybe because it was cold or maybe because they messed up our buns. The chips and salsa were pretty good. I can't get overly thrilled about it.

Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and did not make 1 mistake. His suggestions were simple - get the pretzel bun and add a fried egg on top of whatever you get. Needless to say, his suggestions were on point and we all had a wonderful experience! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

I was really excited to try this place after its 4.5 star review from over 1000 people; however, it didn't live up to my expectations at all.   We ordered chips and salsa and for an extra $2 you can get guac, but don't do it, it was bland, the chips needed salt and the salsa had no real heat.  I ordered the hatch burger which came with a hatch chili on it and cheese. That's it. No lettuce or veggies or even a spread (menu said chipotle aioli but that came with my tots, not the burger). The burger and the tots were luke warm at best.   Service was mediocre at best.",

    "text": "I had heard such good things about Rehab, but with expensive, mediocre food and dismal service I was very disappointed with my visit.  My friend and I decided to stop here before a Giants game at nearby Scottsdale Stadium. It was totally packed and there was an estimated 20 minute wait. Not bad, we had about an hour before the game started. Once seated, we all decided on our food quickly, but no waitress was to be found. It had to be at least 15 minutes of sitting alone in our little corner table before the waitress came. I ordered the smaller relapse backyard BBQ burger. 20 minutes later we finally had our food. By the time we had finished our meal and paid the check, we were late to the game.   The food was bleh. No flavor, my burger was cooked well-done when I had asked for medium. The spicy pineapple BBQ sauce was gross. Whoever thought of that flavor combo should be fired. It just didn't work. The onion ring on the burger was soggy. The fries were bland as well. My friend wasn't happy with his bacon cheeseburger either. His burger too was overcooked and flavorless. For the quality of food we were served, we way overpaid. Our total was around $35 for two people.   We came to Rehab thinking we could: A. Save some money, by eating before the game. and B. Have a great burger. Neither of those things happened. We should've just had eaten at the game. Maybe they had an off day, but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",

Sauces were all over the place and weren't anything special. The one with pineapple was just weird.   Highlight of my meal was sweet potato tots. I'm a fan of tots and sweet potatoes. Not sure if they made them in house, but they were good. Beer selection was not focused on quality micros, mostly all main stream junk. Had a Four Peaks that was decent, but that was literally the only microbrew that they carried. Disappointing.   Overall, would definitely not be back unless I had no choice. Pick another place.

But they have a HUGE selection of burgers you can try, and the option to make your own burger. Get the pretzel bun, you won't be disappointed.   The Fries... I believe they're called \"Skin-On fries,\" well let me tell you about these fries... They're the perfect balance of soft and crispy, and that mermaid dust... I only dream about it. You're probably asking yourself, \"What's mermaid dust?\" Well my friends let me tell you, its this magical dust that they put on their fries... and it's best flavor you'll ever taste... I can't even describe how perfect it is. Not to mention that it goes great with the spicy ketchup. YUM The Drink- I got a Dos Equis... and that was only because I was craving it. But I do know that they have a decent selection of beers, and other drinks. They have excellent daily drink specials... and that  is number one in my book.   The Staff... I would have to agree with some of the previous reviewers, they're not in your face... but they're attentive. And they're up for recommending burgers for you. The service overall was impressive, and VERY quick. Super friendly.   Will I come back? HECK YES. I might actually head over there right now. :)",

I wish I could have had a beer with this, but had to hit the road back to Tucson.  The burger was cooked just right, and it the oozing pb and j ran onto my fries for dipping.  It had the perfect combo of sweet and spice.  Good service, nice ambiance - I kinda felt like I was on vacation on the beach - a nice desert oasis.  I want to go back and try more of the burgers - there are so many to choose from!",

Fortunately one day we got off of work a little early and were able to beat the dinner rush. I got the Jalapeno Popper burger and it was such a disappointment. I was expecting fresh fried jalapenos, but they were the frozen/pickled peppers with no taste and to top it off the burger was dry and bland. And then the final straw was the soda was flat and not enough syrup. I mentioned that to the server and she replaced it with a different selection, and even that was flat. We were super hoping to love this place like everyone else, but just didn't meet par with what we'd expect from a burger place. However, the music selection was great - and if we were craving the SoCal vibes and there's not a long line, we might try it again, but I'll just stick with the basic burger next time.",

At first I was skeptical at the sound of such a burger but then decided since I love beef and also love PB and J and let's be real, who doesn't love sweet potato tots, that I would give this burger a try. The Burger was Amazing! It was cooked to perfection and blended well with the PB and J and oh I forgot to mention, Siracha! The burgers we ordered were ready in a timely fashion and the service there was great. The menu had many great options, and was very fairly priced. Would definitely recommended Rehab Burger to all my friends.",

    "text": "Our first visit here. Staff was very friendly. Salyna (pronounced Selena) was extremely nice, efficient, and checked back frequently to refill tea and water. Ordered the MacNCheese burger on pretzel bun. Since I am retired from a national restaurant chain that specializes in hamburgers, I'm discriminating in my opinion. It was an excellent hamburger - we order the relapse size and my wife had a little of it, and I was still full with my portion. The meat - cooked medium - had a little pink, which is what we wanted, and the MacNCheese was flavorful with a good kick from the sirachi sauce. Toppings were fresh, fries were tasty. The fry portion that came with the burger wasn't huge, so if you are a big fry eater you may want to add an extra order. Saw the onion rings go by to another table and they looked large and fresh. Had a frozen margarita which was well blended (probably a machine which we like) with a tasty margarita mix, lots of salt on the rim, and a large portion. We arrived at 11:15AM  on a Thursday morning and by noon they were on a wait. Just a note: we had a small medical service dog with us  and they were very accommodating and didn't hassle us. We will definitely go back and try other burgers and sides.",

Our burgers are always amazing and I love that they have so many other options to choose from for people who do not eat burgers and such (like my vegetarian sister)  So if I were to come I could get my burger as usual and they could have all the time in the world to read up on the rest of the menu.  I like the hangover burger the best because I love eggs especially over easy on my burgers.  Kind of a constant staple for me lately.  I have to go and try their shakes and pot brownies still. so once I try more and the desserts I will add more to this review. But if you are looking for a great burger spot in Scottsdale this is my first choice for this city!  As far as service goes, nothing worth raving about but its never horrible. Consistent is the word for their service but not persistent if that makes any sense. So if you need a refill...Speak up.",

I was looking forward to trying a burger that I has seen on yelp in a picture, to find out that it is a Sunday special only, but the pulled pork that burger that I did get was amazing, I had a yummy lunch the next day too! Service was good, I was surprised by their uniforms or spaghetti strapped belly shirts, but I guess that is what adds uniqueness to an establishment. The place was packed, so obviously they are doing something right. Very upbeat establishment, but parking was hard to come by.",

As a matter of fact they never did ask me how I wanted my 10 ounce burger cooked, but when it came out and I had my first taste I knew it was love at first bight! I dont think I have ever had a better cooked or tastier burger in my life! The carmlized onions were bliss and the pretzle bun had just the right heft to hold up to this massive burger  The place was only 11 days old on our visit so when the Pig Wings didnt fly, that misfire was excused, but with a tad more work this intersting cut of pork could soar. The \"wings\" were just a tad dry and the sauce was one dimentional, but I like the concept.   Our server offered the wedge salad $5 and said it was good- she was flat out lying, it was amazing! By far the very best wedge I ever ate, made myself, or served any one of my customers. Our group of 3 were still talking about it 3 days later, and we are all foodies that work in the Biz.  One of the owners stopped by the table to chat, that was a nice touch and her crazy beautifull smile was a more then welcome addition to our lunch.  Is this the best restaurant in town... Heck No! it's far to cassual to compete with the very best, but its my new favorite place in Old Town. jv",

The interaction of ChB and B2Q coursing through your veins gives you the kind of rush that keeps you up at night. Your friends don't understand, but how could they?  \"Just one more porkster burger... people do it all the time, right?\" Once you've inevitably built up a tolerance to the BBQ pork-topped cheeseburger, and you're jonesin' for more, Rehab is there. You can start doing 10 oz. of patty a day instead of 5 oz. like it's nothin'.  As you spiral further and further out of control, speedballs of sweet potato tots mixed with BBQ pork, pineapple aoli, pretzel rolls, and brioche buns... the kinda shit you'd only heard about... it's all a part of your daily routine.  One day you're a successful young hopeful, the next you're pulling tricks for porksters.  Warning: Rehab once, Relapse forever.",

So,  two in our party ordered the PB&J, bacon & Sriracha burger.  I ordered the Bbq burger with the chef's creation of spicy pineapple bbq sauce. So you need to know the \"Rehab\" burger is 10oz of flame broiled deliciousness and the \"Relapse\" burger much more manageable (but still plenty) with a 5oz patty.  You get a choice of a brioche or pretzel bun..we all opted for the pretzel bun which was perfectly soft but held together well for the burger that definitely is smothered & covered in the respective sauces.   A bit after ordering we realized waitress hadn't asked us of the size of burger & after checking,  she'd assumed the guys wanted the larger size (one didn't) & mine the regular size.  So,  PB&J burger had plenty of thick, crisp bacon, no skimping there!  The grape jelly & peanut butter melt with the hot burger creating a bit of a slippery handful!  One in party said too much pb...he said would order again, without the pb. The other said would absolutely order again.  Mine,  absolutely smothered in tangy bbq sauce, not too spicy & cooked perfectly!  Sauce everywhere!   They did great job with correct meat temp. All had the sweet potato tots-delish! The sweet & savory dipping sauces also very good.  We had elsewhere to be so couldn't take leftovers but was stuffed full!   Ok,  so this is a little thing but in the restrooms they had actual towels to wipe your paws off..this was very nice!   Fun,  surfer - dude decor, good music and bar! Fun place!",

Nice to see a little yelp discount on the chips but not very impressed by the item. Chips and guacamole were both just okay in my book. For our burgers, I rolled with the PB Burger and others had the Blue Cheese Burger and the Burger covered in BBQ Pork I believe (sorry forgot the name). As for my burger, I loved it. The PB was oozing out and oh so yummy. The recommended bun was on point and the fries were good. As for the other burgers, the Blue Cheese filled Burger just missed the mark. It was very dry, I mean very dry and felt bad for family who ordered it. The Burger covered in BBQ Pork was good. Again, burger was a little dry but the pork was good. Overall, the PB Burger was amazing but the others just missed. I would give the spot another try but at this time, won't be giving any super praise.",

The burger (larger \"rehab\" portion) was ENORMOUS, with a ton of cheese and a bunch of sauted onions.  It was juicy and greasy, but in a very good/non-disgusting way.  The onion rings were pretty good, but not amazing.  I was intrigued by the \"pot brownie\" dessert, but had absolutely no room left to even consider it.  Really good food, really good service, and really good value.  If you leave there with any room left in your stomach, you've done something wrong. :)",

I might go into detail later, but all I will say for now is...you can do better Last thing... do not be fooled by the sauteed mushroom swiss burger!!!

    "text": "Fantastic burgers and really tasty tots and fries! Tried the spicy mac n cheese and the ghost burger, both were really delicious. The mac n cheese on the mac n cheese burger could have gotten serious props on its on, but being on a burger just elevated its creamy, cheesy flavor even more. Ask for the diablo hot sauce to try on the ghost burger (SO FREAKIN GOOD).   The fries and sweet potato tots were also super yummy. Great potato-y flavor in both, and they went really well with the huge variety of sauces the waiter brought for dipping. Speaking of the waiter, the service was also very good, with the manner being a little casual and brusque, but everything we ordered and subsequent requests were treated graciously, and brought out very quickly. He also took the down to sit down (casual manner I was talking about), and explain which were the best and most popular burgers. He said the PBJ bacon burger is the most popular, but my friend thought it sounded gross so we didn't order it since we had decided to split them.   We got the smaller (relapse) size on both, and they were more than big enough, especially given the VERY generous portions of mac n cheese on the spicy mac burger and guac on the ghost.   Overall, a very well-rounded establishment with very good food. If you are a burger lover, you'll love this place, and it's easy to see why it was voted best burger in AZ last year. It was even most recently featured on the travel channel (last Sunday I believe).   PS Get the burgers on the pretzel bun!!",

The burgers were cooked to perfection and the fries as well as the bacon on our burgers were crispy and yummy. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I didn't get the egg on my burger and the food wasn't ready when I was supposed to pick it up.

But, with so many great places in old town this just doesn't quite measure up.  The alcohol selection leaves a bit to be desired in terms of variety.   There are however, a lot of different, and unique burgers here. I tried the PB and J burger. I was hesitant to try it because I wasn't convinced the textures/flavors would win me over like it has for others who reviewed this restaurant.  Personally, the thickness of the peanut butter made it difficult for me to enjoy. I wouldn't order it again,  but it was worth trying.    Overall,  its a nice place to stop in if you're feeling adventurous and craving a different kind of burger from the norm.",

Also bartender Cortney was friendly and sweet. I am allergic to high fructose corn syrup. I asked her if she knew what was in the mix. She right away pulled the mix and showed me the label. Quality ingredients and Patron was on special. Oh hell yes! Burger was cooked perfectly and fries were yummy not greasy. It is SO NICE to see a kick back place use QUALITY ingredients. The burger meat is a mix of balanced flavors.  Coming back for sure. Keep it up guys! P.S. the music is perfect mix of beach and mello reggae. Fab. The owner of this business is a genius.",

I had the bacon blue which was tender and cooked just right. Macaroni burger instagram worthy!  You won't regret trying this place.",

This place stood out among the results and we were definitely not disappointed.  I got the porkster, my girlfriend got the wedge.  We also ordered a small side of spicy mac and chilli cheese fries.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The burger was cooked to perfection and the pulled pork was so tender.  Visiting from Chicago, I'd happily return again!",

We decided to come here thanks to you fellow Yelpers, and ordered the much raved about PB&J with bacon burger. I ordered it with the sweet potato tots, and the Chipotle aioli. The sauce alone was amazing, but then with the tots, it added some great spiciness. And okay so the burger was AMAZING. I could not even finish it all, and I got the 5oz (other option being the 10oz). I was hesitant at first, because what a weird combination! But PB&J is a classic, and when you add bacon the smokiness takes it to a whole other level. Our waitress was attentive, and the ambiance is fun. I went on a Sunday evening and didn't have to wait, but I imagine this place can get super packed because one visit just isn't enough!",

    "text": "Let me just say that if I was ever in a burger rehab therapy clinic these would be the burgers I'd want for my meds. I bookmarked this place on Yelp a long time ago but since we live in Maricopa and work in Chandler we rarely ever venture to Scottsdale. But the other day we were like \"F-it, let's do it!\"  There were no wait times when we arrived, which is nice. They have patio seating but the decor was so fun we opted to sit inside. This place was completely decked out in beach decor. We truly felt like we were sitting in one of our favorite food shacks in San Diego off mission beach. We ordered some chips and salsa to start since we had our Check-In coupon from Yelp. If you've read my other reviews you know how super picky I am about chips AND salsa. To my surprise both were great!! Usually there is always one I'm a little \"eh\" about but at Rehab both were really good! For the burgers I ordered the Hawaiian Burger and added guacamole and my boyfriend got the Ghost Burger and we both decided to try their sweet poTOToes. (Yes that's how it's spelt!) Holy beefy amazingness batman! These burgers were delicious! They were perfectly cooked to order and I love the traditional buns they use. The tots came with this chipotle aioli sauce that was a \"I'm-ganna-just-drink-this-sh*t\" kind of good. My only regret is not being able to finish all my food! You know where you're eating and you know you're too full but you keep saying to yourself \"just one more bite...\" Yeah...that was me. It was so good but it was so much food. We all know burgers and fries/tater tots don't reheat well at all so I knew even though I was taking leftovers it wouldn't get eaten. So sad... At least my boyfriend ate all of his. Service was great too! Drinks always stayed filled, food came out at a normal time frame and the staff was very friendly. Overall this was fantastic experience and we'll definitely be making our back here soon with some friends. So should you go here? Yes. Should you come hungry? Yes. Should you expect to feel like an overstuffed thanksgiving turkey ready to bust? Yes. Will you love it? Absolutely.",

    "text": "After making the move to the Scottsdale area from Indiana just a couple days ago, me and my dad were looking for a spot to grab a great burger and beer. Once I began my search the name Rehab Burger Therapy caught my eye. I read the reviews from fellow Yelpers and couldn't help but make the trip to try it out.  Most every review I read had something great to say about the PBJ & Bacon burger, which is what I went with. Now let me remind you that I had already had the best peanut butter burger on earth, the Duane Purvis from the famous Triple XXX in West Lafayette, IN. Don't believe me, just ask any other Purdue alum & they will tell you the same. Although it's hard for me to say it is better than the Duane Purvis, it was damn good. I was a little skeptical about the jelly & bacon part of the equation, but it was a great compliment. An unusual burst of flavor that most any would enjoy, especially if you're the adventurous type.   As far as beer goes, I just had a simple Bud Light. I would like to see them incorporate more beers into their selections. Perhaps some beers from local micro-breweries, since that is all the craze at the moment. But it was nice a cold, just the way I like it.  Safe to say I'll be back soon to try out one of their other numerous burger options!",

The people I was  with though really went all out and got some of the crazy unique burgers on the menu. Like getting a friend egg on the burger. If I ever return I will def be trying something more unique. I am not usually a sweet potato fan, but the sweet potato tots were actually extremely good and the sauces paired with them really gave them a unique but awesome flavor.",

The service overall was okay but one weird thing was the waitress ran up to us when our mouths were full and said \"how's the first bites? Delicious? Okay!\" And then walked away before we could say anything.  Maybe we came on an off day but it seems like they are just hiding poorly cooked burgers with a lot of fancy toppings.

She brought us extra sauces so we can try them as it was our first time there.

Robin offered to get us a new one or to try their Pot Brownie without us even asking. She definitely went above and beyond.   Go!! Great service...good food...prepare to have a food baby o.O!!! AWK",

I would literally eat a bowl on mac and cheese with there burger patties right in top. It was pretty busy both times I went, but that always a good sign because it means GOOD FOOD! The waitresses were knowledgeable of the menu when I asked for suggestions the first time I went as well. Good place for just chilling and good eats. Kind of has a lounge feel to it. No so much a sports bar. Would recommend as a great spot to bring fam and friends who enjoy a great burger.",

Sitting there among the hanging cruiser bikes and surfboards, it feels like you've left Scottsdale and entered a beach bar somewhere. The atmosphere is laid back without sacrificing service. The staff is quick and friendly. Their efficiency was impressive.  I ordered the 5 oz. Backyard BBQ burger. It's stacked with two big, delicious onion rings, Colby jack cheese and loaded with bbq sauce (almost too much sauce, if there is such a thing).   The fries were fresh, and crispy. The pickle spear that comes with the burger is no slouch either. It's not a limpy, weak pickle spear. It's stout and crunchy. Yup... I just complimented a pickle.   If I knew therapy could be this good, I'd have gone years ago.",

That's saying a lot, since we eat burgers in Nashville, Dallas, California and wherever else we may end up.  I could classify my husband as a burger connoisseur.  Burgers are one of his four food groups.  This Reggae playing, Island Beach themed establishment is one busy place.  Get there early if you have a preference for inside or patio seating.  The wait for the food is always worth it!  Rehab has a large selection to choose from and they don't only offer Burgers, which they serve just about anyway one could dream up, (i.e. PBJ Burger, the Farmer, the Porker), they have salads, sandwiches and awesome service by an excellent, humorous, and attentive wait staff.    I usually build my own burger, choosing the Brioche Bun, which is always fresh and not in any way a bland old white burger bun.  One may also opt for a Wheat or Pretzel Bun, which I want to try every time, but I can't seem to refuse the yummy Brioche.  My husband ordered an 'un-hinge your jaw' humongo burger which he thoroughly enjoyed.  To name a couple of their quite delightful sides:  sweet potato tots and deep fried Cajan and Butter seasoned fresh Corn on the Cob.  This isn't an ordinary nor a boring burger place.   It's a good thing Rehab is 4 states away from us!  This is the kind of restaurant where most everyone leaves wishing they hadn't eaten SO much.  Good is not the proper adjective to describe this 5 Star Burger Bar.",

A friend of mine and I stopped in for happy hour and enjoyed a couple of drinks that were both good and reasonably priced. We came on a Monday at 1pm and left around 2:30ish. There was quite a crowd there during that time, many of whom were enjoying some really nice looking burgers. What I liked most was that the patrons were made up of people of all ages, young to old. The ambiance is inviting and easy to enjoy, they have indoor and outdoor seating with shade. The waiter we had was great, no complaints. The only potential problem I can see here is parking. We parked directly north of the restaurant in a dirt patch. Other than that, it didn't look like much parking was available.",

We ended up sitting on the patio (table of 7) during an awesome AZ Winter night. It is not a huge place, so I am guessing a wait is pretty common. I like the semi-tiki theme and am kicking myself for not trying a mai tai or one of their cocktails. I went with a bottle of red stripe from there decent beer menu. My 5 star rating is all about the food. There were at least 8-10 burgers I considered ordering. I went with the spicy mac and cheese burger. Mac, bacon, jalepenos- whats not to love? It was everything I thought it could be and more. Everyone at the table had a burger, many varieties, and they were all a hit. Big flavor, quality toppings, and solid fries on the side as well. When I get that burger craving, the hangover burger is the next one I am crossing off the list. Thanks for the rehab!",

Also, sweet potato tater tots. YUM. The service was great and friendly too. Only 4 stars because I wasn't able to order any adult beverages since I was going to work... But it was a nice place, cheerful folks and GREAT food. I'm totally coming back.",

    "text": "Burger joint in the heart of Old Town with a surfing theme.  I don't eat red meat or pork so I'm always search of a good turkey burger and Rehab did not disappoint.  The menu is pretty extensive and offers everything from your basic fries and sweet potato tots to clams to wings to beef burgers to fish and chicken burgers.  When I'm starving, my eyes are often bigger than my stomach so I opted for a side salad, half order of buffalo wings, and turkey burger with cheddar on a wheat bun.   The salad was made with mixed greens and tasted really good.    I had the wings cooked extra crispy and they came out perfectly.  They were cooked in a buffalo sauce that had really good flavor.  It had little pieces of garlic mixed in the sauce.  So far, these are definitely the best wings I've tasted in Scottsdale.    The turkey burger consisted of a really good size patty that was super juicy (uncharacteristic for turkey burgers).  It was definitely the best turkey burger I've had in Scottsdale.  If you are search of a nice, tasty burger joint with a beachy, hipster vibe, then look no further.  Definitely check out this place!",

My younger ones had a grilled cheese and bbq wings.   Both were so tasty.   The wings also had a kick. It was sweet, tangy and spicy.  Just the way we line it. The outside had a crunch yet moist inside.   The grilled cheese was in thick pieces of bread, like Texas toast.  Great crunch. Cheesy. Your choice of any cheeses. We also had a side of sweet potato tots.  Those were also very good.   Very good customer service. It was busy and our waiter kept up very well.  No errors at all and friendly.",

I got the Backyard BBQ burger, relapse (5 oz) size and my boyfriend got the PB+J 10 oz size because our waitress told us it was the most popular and he wanted to be bold.  Well anyways, the PB+J burger was actually good. What?! Life is full of surprises. The menu says there's sriracha in it but he couldn't taste it at all.  I substituted my onion rings w/ pineapple instead and it was very hawaiian tasting.   The menu is very creative. The burgers were good but wasn't amazing. The sweet potato tots were verrry delicious. I love anything sweet potato. And the sauces made it better.",

To be fair we'd heard of their other locations and had vowed to try them sometime lil did we know Sunday was the day. Craft Burger joints are all the rage these days and we like going to them because they often have Gluten Free Buns, and other GF options.  When we walked in we were greeted by every staffer that walked by even though they were not the Hostess.  This was a nice touch and an indicator of how they roll here.  After a brief wait Kate the manager seated us and within mere seconds Josey our server came by.  We told Josey we were new and had some questions...Josey pulled up a chair and sat down to speak with us as if we were the only people in the place!  Again nice personal touch!  We explained our need to be Gluten Free and she explained the menu in detail and answered each question confidently.  We placed the order and our food came out quickly and correctly.  I must say the food was brought out by a different server which was equally nice seeing the teamwork here.  Josey stopped by regularly to check on us and to be sure our cocktails were topped off, she never missed a beat!   It is worth noting they were dealing with a packed house .  After a great lunch with great service we are hooked!  Whatever they are doing at Rehab good job!  Josey is the real deal, Kate manages a great team and I dig this place and the food!  I wish I could be there more but Scottsdale is a long way from Tucson!  We will definitely be back thanks Rehab for the great food and service!",

You can taste the quality. So the food was great. We also had wings, again, very good.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of he service. We were sat from the hostess and we didn't have a server come see us for about 12 min. And she finally came, took a drink order and then we didn't see her again to give her the order for another 10 min.  She finally came and said she was sorry and that she was overwhelmed bc she had so many tables. I think the manager that was standing chatting with the hostess the whole time or the other waiters could have jumped in to help but there was no team effort in there. We felt sorry for her. We will go back, but not on a busy night for sure.",

I will get that club again but on smaller bread. She said they have a marble rye which is smaller. I will go for that. Waitress was super helpful and friendly!!!

He made his recommendations and we did not oblige.  We ordered our style of burgers...in True LA fashion :/  They made us our burgers as requested and we were happy.  Will definitely stop again on a future visit!",

She was on top of EVERYTHING . When we ordered she helped with the choices .Kudos to her..so laid back and in the cut , even though the place was busy we felt like the ONLY table.    That's just the beginning. The food , wow ! I get it - it's bar food ,but wayyyyyyyy better ! The Pig Wings , dear lord - fantastic ! I'm a complete wing snob admittedly and these were unbelievable. The crispness ,the flavor ,the size ,the sauce(sweet with a little heat) ...absolutely great ! Next time I'll try the regular wings .   The main meal was Pescado Borracho and Poblano burger. Both were fantastic ! The choice of condiments, pickle and sides were plentiful . The food was ALL at perfect temperature. you can smell and taste the beer with the fish dish . The tartar sauce was a perfect compliment . Also , the portions...hell yeah !! BIG portions , no filler -all killer . $40 and a little change was the bill . COMPLETELY worth it .",

It's a crazy combination of peanut butter, jelly, bacon, and burger. Right about now, you're probably saying ewww but don't knock it 'till you've tried it. That burger was great and the pretzel bun was sturdy enough to keep it together.  They have a lot of creative options if what I got isn't appealing. For any burger, get the single or split a double with someone. It's a lot of food. My friend got the fish and that was huge too. You won't leave hungry.  The sweet potato tots were underwhelming for flavor but the burger made up for it. Maybe try the regular fries. Either way, I'd totally go back here. Too bad I don't live anywhere remotely nearby.",

Brian, our waiter, was so good at what he does. His personality was upbeat, excited, friendly, and he really knew the menu even though he said he had only been there for a couple months. When asked for recommendations he gave our table ones that everyone liked and then, since I'm super indecisive and enjoy trying new things, I told him to surprise me with any burger on the menu my only specifications were it couldn't have pork and it couldn't be super spicy. It was as if he knew my exact personality because he literally picked the PERFECT burger for me. It was covered in mac and cheese and was on a pretzel bun with sweet poTOToes and pesto aioli on the side. It was seriously so great and I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great burger! I also hope Brian keeps up his great attitude and smile and gets recognized for that! Thank you, Rehab, for a 5 star experience!",

The waitress came to cash us out and never once apologized for disappearing on us.

    "text": "i don't ask much in my search for the perfect burger. Yes, it's nice to dine in a well kept restaurant. It's also enjoyable when the staff is interactive and friendly. A buzzing atmosphere is always a nice touch.   But when it comes down to it, when I'm looking for the Taj Mahal of burgers, it all balances on what is served. And let me tell you, RBT knows how to serve a burger that will satisfy your deepest bovine desires.   The menu is full of unique and staple burger offerings. The one that caught my attention, however, was the PBJ and Bacon burger. Upon reading the burger's description,  I felt more conflicted than a Southern Baptist at a Castro District drag show.   \"Wait a minute, PBJ does not belong on a burger!\"  \"What?! The patty is drenched in sriracha?!\"  \"I can get it with a pretzel bun as well?!\"  The universe, as I saw it, was collapsing everywhere I looked. None of this made any sense to my respectable burger palate, and I yearned to taste this forbidden concoction of beef, bacon, thai hot sauce, and pb&j. Not to be outdone by the unique burger, I forewent the pedestrian side of fries and ordered the Jamaican corn to accompany my otherworldly dish.  What happened when dinner was served is somewhat of a blur. No, I was not intoxicated (in the traditional sense) - I can only compare it to the moment when you first meet your soulmate. That moment you will never forget, but cannot remember to the fullest detail. With my very first bite, my synapses were firing at a rate that a M134 Minigun couldn't match. My eyes bulged with intense fulfillment, my skin emitted a cool sweat of indulgence, and I could have sworn I heard the faithful tune \"Take my Breath Away\" ringing in my subconscious state of euphoria. I had found it, the perfect burger was in my grasp and I felt unworthy.   The burger, like most fleeting romances, was gone before I could sincerely take in the magnitude of this event. Fortunately, the Jamaican corn was still at my disposal, and may God turn me into a horny toad if that side wasn't an outstanding compliment to the burger. Now the Jamaican corn wasn't from the same metaphysical realm from which the PBJ and Bacon burger originated, but it was more like a swan song for my recently departed dish, an ultimate tribute for the tantric experience of RBT.  RBT delivered when it counted most, and I'm not talking about a swift thrill, I'm talking about the kind of satisfaction that is almost melancholy, as if my burger pilgrimage was finally complete. Time will only tell if this is True, but until then, RBT is the home of my favorite burger.",

Manager came and started making excuses for the waiter. In the end he took our bill and gave us a 10% discount, which would not even start to make up for a terrible experince that we ended up having. Honestly, i would consider this to be one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life. We won't be coming back and i would not recommend anyone to visit rehab burger.",

Our waitress (bless her heart) was the sweetest lady, and even went out of her way to cut an aloe vera branch from the plant outside for my friend to tend to his wounds. Seriously, is that excellent service or what??  I tried the know poblano burger (grilled spicy onions, manchego, and roasted poblanos) which was absolutely mindblowing. The burger was cooked perfectly, the flavors were unique and punchy, and I finished the whole damn thing despite being full 1/3 of the way in.  And on that note, if you're debating if you're hungry enough to get the 10oz vs the 5oz....seriously, don't be a pansy, get the 10oz.",

    "text": "I must have ordered the wrong thing.  I love heat so when I saw they had a ghost burger with ghost pepper cheese I was in! I was asked if I would like a white or wheat bun, I opted for wheat.  I was asked if I would like fries or sweet potato fries, I said fries.  Let's start with the burger.  The bun was oversized and oblong shaped, not round so there was that issue.  The bun was also not toasted at all as you can tell by the lack of color.  This cold bun could have been warmed up a little before putting more cold guacamole up against it.  The burger itself was overcooked and not juicy at all.  The \"ghost pepper cheese\" barely had any heat.  I feel like a slice of jalapeno would have delivered more of a punch.  The \"crispy onions\" were so overcooked that they were black and there was no \"crispy\" at all.  When I hear crispy onions I'm thinking shaved onions that are tossed in tapioca or rice flower then tossed in the deep fryer for 30 seconds to develop a nice crunch like an onion ring would have, not onions sauteed on a flat top.  Overall the burger was quite possibly one of the worst burgers I've ever had.  It reminded me of going to your friends house for a bbq who thinks he can cook and gives you a burger you have to douse in ketchup just to get it down.    The fries although crispy had some weird seasoning on it that gave it a citrus taste almost like a yuzu powder.  Whatever it was was not expected and not welcome. At least I had a delicious chipotle ranch to dip the fries in.    The only reason I'm giving Rehab Burger Therapy 2 stars and not 1 is because the bartender was by far the most attentive bartender I had on my trip to Scottsdale where apparently customer service does not exist.  I wish I would have gotten her name because I never had an empty drink in front of me.  I'm sure I could have complained about the burger but I didn't want to be the guy that asks for the place to cook a whole new burger for me and throw this one away.    I'm thinking either the kitchen didn't care because it was an hour til closing when I ordered and there were only 3 other people in there, or I really ordered the wrong thing since all of the other burger pictures looks amazing and way better than mine.  Either way I'm giving it 2 stars and I won't be coming back with all the other amazing food options in Scottsdale.",

However, it never stops me from going to a burger joint especially this one here. Your probably thinking why does this chic eat at a burger joint then. Well, they have more than burgers. You can choose your meat from Grilled Chicken, Turkey Burger, and Vegetarian Burger at no additional cost. All to pile on top of their mounds of fresh ingredients and toppings. Oh yes! I must tell you that you can choose your bun. I suggest trying the pretzel bun. YUM! You can even choose to build your own burger. My favorite choice, though they have a creative pre-fixed menu with many different tasty items.   The sides are hard to choose from. I love the fries, sweet potato tater tots, onion rings and much more. They offer a variety of sauces to choose from. Many that are unique.   The service is not always the best. The ladies are not very welcoming at times and don't have the friendliest personalities. I can say they have never messed up on my order and bring my food out in a reasonable time.   I have to say \"Just what the doctor ordered.\" I was in food coma. lol!",

He checked on us once throughout our meal and he failed to bring us silverware -- which is such a simple thing to do! Considering I needed a fork to eat my side salad, this bothered me immensely. After the servers (not our waiter) dropped off our burgers, there was no contact from our waiter. What made the situation worse was that it was hard to flag down someone to bring us our silverware and some ketchup because it was a busy night (and we had two babies we were trying to keep entertained while we waited). We almost didn't tip our waiter, that's how uninvolved he was with us.   The food, which was good, was cold and seemed like it had been sitting out for a while. The sweet potato tater-tots were so tasty but could have been warmer, the mac and cheese on my burger was barely warm and my sister-in-law's burger bun was soggy from the sauce. I was really let down by my experience because Rehab Burger Therapy had come highly recommended.   They had an interesting menu and I'd give it a redemtion run if I lived in the area but I probably won't be recommending this place to anyone.",

    "text": "I'm not a huge burger fan but I was excited to try RBT. I found the name to be quite clever and photos of the burgers and sweet potato tots looked extraordinary.   FOOD Burgers come in 5oz \"Relapse\" or 10oz \"Rehab\" for a few dollars more. I got the Philly cheese burger, which didn't have all the toppings I had seen in a photo on Yelp, but perhaps there was a change with ingredients or the customer had a special request.   The sweet potato tater tots were on point, but they seemed to be overly-sweetened. I liked how pretzel buns were an option and it came with a quarter of a large pickle.     ATMOSPHERE The place had a hipster, tavern, beach-desert, bar-like vibe. The table we were seated at was wobbly, as was my chair. Due to minimal lighting, it's not an ideal place for foodie photos.   SERVICE I thought service was going to be decent, but I wasn't impressed. Our waitress was nice but effort regarding water service was minimal. It wasn't very busy at 3 pm on a Friday but it took over 30 minutes before our meal arrived. I would suggest ordering over the phone for anyone trying to swing by for a 1-hour lunch break.     PARKING There's a public parking lot nearby. Finding the entrance was a bit tricky since most of the lanes were closed off.  OVERALL I like the concept, creativity, and presentation but I felt that service and taste could be improved. I could see how some people love this place, but I found it to be average in quality and value.",

Our food was just good and not great.  I like the concept of a rehab burger or a relapse burger with the rehab being larger, but there wasn't anything special with their ground and was just OK.  The worst of it was their mac and cheese fell flat and had a grainy texture instead of a creamy texture like you would anticipate.  Neat place on the inside with kind of a Hawaiian theme.",

I figured I might as well give it a try. I'm so happy that I did because my guess and I was having a pretty good time. And it helped bring a good close to our  already good day.   We got there in the middle of happy hour and there was many happy people ( Lol ). Very good atmosphere mixed with good service. I really enjoyed the decor of the place from The different styles of bicycles, surfboards to the oversize model airplanes. Nice casual grunge thing going on and I liked it along with some good music.   Very good food with many options from gourmet burgers to draft beers even specialty drinks for adults was very good and many options. I started off with a Coco Nutty cocktail drink and I followed it up with the Porkster gourmet burger which has spicy pulled pork on a medium rare burger with sweet potato tater tot's. It so worked for me. I was so full. Definitely done for the day. No complaints. I will be returning here.",

    "text": "Highly recommended by friends, I decided to stop here for my first meal on vacation in AZ! It really hit the spot.  Lots of outdoor and indoor seating. Super friendly and attentive servers. Extensive menu with lots of options. I ordered the pig \"wings\" which are really chopped pieces of ribs. I enjoyed the texture as they were fall off the bone but grilled enough to be slightly dry. However they were doused in too much sauce which was a bit overly sweet. should have skipped this. 3/5 Then I had the must have PB&J bacon burger on a pretzel bun with sweet potato tots. No regrets whatsoever here. It's messy and I had to cut my burger into fourths to eat it. And the PB&j gets everywhere so it's easier to mop it up this way with a fork. Sounds weird but it's a great flavor combo ! Especially if you like pb&j and burgers separately, you'll probably enjoy this just as much as I did. The sweet potato tots were a little softer/soggier than I would have liked but they were still super enjoyable. I ditched the other two sauces that came with it and mopped up all my remaining PB&j with the tots. Me thinks I'm gonna start eating all my fries with peanut butter from now on if possible :p so yum! The weather was perfect for sitting outside and I really enjoyed my first meal in AZ! I'm a fatty when on vacation~",

I can't say I was really hungry but she asked what i wanted to eat. I told her whatever the house specialty was.  Well I got it.   Out came a peanut butter and jelly covered bacon cheeseburger with sriracha sauce. Yeah that's what I said. My tastebuds were so confused I couldn't even tell if I liked it until the 3rd bite. So many different flavors.  However the more bites I took the more I could respect its flavors working together. By the last couple of bites I found myself putting a little of the PBJ that had squeezed out onto the bite I was about to take.   I gotta say, pretty darn good and a memorable dining experience!",

Doubled for the same items as when they opened a few years ago. There are a lot of burgers on the menu that are over $18! What's next a $100 burger? And that's just it. They are just burgers. No special grind of prime beef just chuck. They will surely ruin a good thing by getting too greedy. The reason this restaurant was popular in the first place was it had decent prices and good portion size. Too bad. I am so sorry to see them take this direction. Good while it lasted.",

While good, the burgers seemed to lack that flavor \"pop\" that really grabs you when you have a burger that really stands out.  Especially lacking was a distinct beef flavor from the burgers.  The burger itself was actually kind of bland with the toppings taking the limelight.  Definitely not disappointing but I really did expect more when I read many of the previous glowing reviews.  A plus was the fast, friendly service.",

    "text": "We went here for lunch over the weekend, having heard great things. The place was absolutely packed, which seemed a strong indicator of the quality of the food, and the service was great. Naturally, I was expecting the burger to go hard (this place does have the word \"burger\" in the name, after all), but, wow, what a disappointment.  I had the Know Poblano Burger. First, let me say that the combination of grilled poblano and manchego cheese was excellent. If that had been all I ate, this would be a different review, though. The problem with flavorful toppings is that you cannot use them to disguise an under-seasoned burger, and that's exactly what I got.  There was virtually no salt or pepper on the patty -- a big issue when the beef is 3/4 of the actual burger. Does anyone in the kitchen have basic culinary training? I'm not even a trained chef, and I know that if you forget to season the main ingredient and attempt to cover it up with ingredients that are seasoned, the whole dish comes out bland. You can't put spicy poblano and salty, melted cheese on top of a flavorless puck of beef and expect me to like it.  Even the bun was soggy, which is mind boggling. How does a place that specializes in burgers not know to put some sort of leafy green between the meat and the bun? This is textbook stuff.  Also, the place was hot. When there's a weekend heat advisory, you might want to turn your thermostat down a few notches -- especially when the restaurant is packed with warm bodies.  By the way, that second star is for the fries, which were perfectly cooked.",

He added egg and bacon on it. Both on the white bun. (I really wanted the add-ons but was trying to make it at least a little healthier, lol). Half pulled pork half beef, with a super yummy bbq sauce and cheddar cheese. mmmm so good. Absolutely no complaints. (+) The sweet potato tater tots were amazing! I could eat those all day. And I chose the spicier of the sauces, super yummy (+) Cool funky decor, nice atmosphere  Neutral: ( ) The Pig Wings (Pork on a stick doused with peachy bbq sauce) - it was just okay. The sauce was a bit too much (completely doused, the menu description wasn't lying). The pork was tender, but I wasn't blown away.  This place was delicious. Top two burger places on my list (first is Holsteins in Las Vegas if you would like to read my review).  I would definitely come here again when I'm in the area, and looking forward to it!",

Great servers who always care that they get my orders right, but also take a moment to chit-chat when they have time instead of hiding behind counters and only being reactive servers.  Your cooks are always on point because the many times I've visited, never once has food come out less than perfect.  And best of all, the very reasonable prices are so appreciated.  I get the best quality burger I've found here in Phoenix, jumbo wings graced with outstanding custom sauces, and at prices lower most anyone else.  I seriously can't go back to Long Wong's, or even my past favorite, Buffalo Wild Wings.  Rehab is THAT good!  If I had to complain about something (and I had to grab at straws to find something); is that I guess I'd ask that you introduce a hotter version of your hot sauce, because I typically go with people who like things a lot hotter than I do.  Oh, and that I'm still looking for a replacement for a \"Wild Wing Cafe\" wing sauce flavor I'd had back in Charlotte, NC a few years ago that they called Jalapeno Cheddar.  It seemed to be a mix of Velveeta, chopped jalapeno pepper, and hot sauce perhaps?  Whatever it was it was fabulous, and I miss it something fierce!",

The chips were hefty (thick goodness) and the salsa tasty. I made a comment at the time we were eating these that they were almost like pita chips.   Then my Hawaiian burger arrived. I had ordered the pretzel bun on the recommendation of our waitress (who was very helpful and attentive), and then I worried about it until the moment that I took my first bite. Wow. The blend of flavors of the Hawaiian with the pretzel bun was perfect, and those sweet potato tots were addictive!  The place was packed on a Thursday evening; maybe having happy hour all day long on Thursday had something to do with it, but my guess is the tasty food brings people here. The decor on the walls and ceiling gives the place a real beachy Ron Jon feel. I'm not a big fan of the high chairs and table arrangement, but there are \"normal\" tables and chairs here too; we just ended up with the high ones. Big patio outside and plenty of space inside.  I didn't see a lot of parking spaces other than a few right in front. Most people were parking on the street, and the line stretched down a few blocks.",

I had already been here before and knew how good their burgers or so I was looking forward to it. I also knew to come hungry so it was a good thing that I skipped breakfast! This time around I opted for the Philly cheese burger on a pretzel bun. The shaved ribeye paired with the provolone cheese and sauteed peppers and onions was a match made in heaven. The burger was cooked perfectly and the dollop of cheese whiz they topped it with made me think I was back in Philly. Hubby ordered the Chili cheeseburger on the traditional brioche bun. We decided to split half-and-half and I'm glad we did. The chili was full of flavor and topped with cheese and sour cream. One of us got the sweet potato tots and the other opted for  onion rings and I would be hard-pressed to say which was my favorite. Both were delicious! Neither one of us could finish all of our burgers so we had a pretty good size takeout container to take back to our furry daughter back home. Service was really good and even though they were extremely crowded our server did a good job of checking up on us every now and then. Hubby enjoyed it (as I knew he would!) and can't wait to return to try one of the other many burgers that he wanted.",

    "text": "So everyone in Scottsdale raves about this place, and when we by chance wandered past it, we had to stop and see what all the excitement was about.   First of all, this place feels like a bar more than a restaurant - just some to keep in mind if you're bringing the young kids.  It's not an obnoxious bar though, but possibly not a place for babies if it's a busy weekend.   Peanut butter and jelly bacon burger on a pretzel bun?  This is the standing \"burger of the year?\"  Definitely not something on the menu in my hometown.  Ordered the petite size with tater tots.   The food arrived quickly, after less than 15 minutes. Taste and quality were good, but perhaps less explosive than what I expected after hearing so much raving about this place. Fortunately it wasn't overly greasy, which is surprising considering it was covered in bacon. It's def not on my normal healthy diet, but this was a special weekend for friends so what the heck.    My verdict was that it was pretty good, and I can check it off the list - but don't need to go out of my way to return here again, and it's still simply a bar that sells burgers and has friendly service.",

We were seated immediately and our server greeted us shortly after that. Our server was amazing, super attentive, kind and funny. He offered suggestions and recommendations for what was good.  My mom and I both started off with corona-ritas. They were delicious. You can tell they were not made with a mix, but fresh limes and lots of tequila. Very good choice and worth the price.   With each burger you get to pick a different kind of roll and either French fries or sweet potato tots. Taking our servers suggestions, I got the PBJ & bacon burger on a pretzel bun with French fries. My burger was amazing. Don't be afraid to try this burger. I made my whole family try it and it was the best burger at the table.  My sister ordered the bacon burger, my dad ordered the BBQ burger, and my mom ordered the patty melt. Everyone enjoyed their burgers and how they were cooked, but the PBJ &a bacon burger was still the best.   Overall food is delicious and the prices were reasonable! Definitely give this place a chance!",

    "text": "This place is great! It is by far my husband's favorite restaurant and we are here weekly. Serving sizes are huge! Even the relapse burger (the \"small\" one) leaves me with leftovers. Drinks are great and my favorites are the Margatini and the medium Bloody. For burgers I always go with the Spicy Mac and it never disappoints.   I'm not always in the mood for a burger so sometimes I just eat my husbands tots and get extra veggies to throw in my Bloody. The weird part is they also charge me a couple bucks for the veggies, but $2 isn't bad so it doesn't bug me, it's just weird to me. Other times I get their pastas which are great or an appetizer. My favorites are the queso dip and the calamari. I'm from CA right on the beach so I'm used to picking out your seafood from the traps on the patio and I can tell the calamari has been on ice, but I still order it so it isn't bad enough to not go back for more.  It is deceptively inexpensive too. We brought my parents and a family friend here last weekend (5 hungry adults total) and ordered a burger each, the pork wings, and a cocktail each and it only came to about $100. I expected it to be more than that so when I sprung to pick up the tab I was pleasantly surprised. They also have cash back through Yelp which is awesome because I get paid to eat somewhere I'm already going to be.  We all were pretty let down when we went on a Sunday at 5pm and they were out of pretzel buns and onion rings. They blamed it on being busy and us coming on a Sunday saying that's the norm, but why not order enough materials to accommodate the weekly needs of your guests if that is the case? One complaint my dad had was that the burgers can be a bit overloaded and busy. I think it's just a millennial thing that we do to food and I agree, but as I watch my husband devour a maple bacon donut burger dripping with Swiss cheese and all kinds of sauces, I can't fault them for it. I swear he'd leave me for that burger if you made it a normal item on the menu, lol.  Come with an appetite and be ready to walk out with leftovers.",

They have a fairly extensive burger menu with the option of doing a larger Rehab size (two 5 oz patties) or a smaller Relapse size with just one 5 oz patty. I opted for Relapse because each burger also comes with a choice of fries or sweet potato tots (went with the tots) and your choice of buns (got the pretzel bun!)  I got the Know your Poblano burger and my boyfriend got the spicy Mac n Cheese burger. Poblano burger came with peppers and grilled onions plus a sauce of your choice (went with chipotle aioli) that comes on the side. Burgers are cooked perfectly and come out hot and juicy. Bf's mac and cheese in his burger was seasoned with jalapenos and sriracha sauce and sooo good.   I also really appreciate a place that has pretzel buns (AND doesn't charge you extra) and also has sweet potato tots.   Prices were reasonable. My burger with tots was just $8.75, which is probably how much a pretzel bun burger with fries at a generic fast food chain would cost.  Service was speedy and attentive and super friendly!",

    "text": "I'd had Rehab bookmarked on Yelp for awhile and finally got to go check it out this weekend. My friends and I arrived around 1pm on Saturday afternoon and were lucky enough to snag one of the last two open tables.   We were greeted right away, given waters and informed of their happy hour specials. Yes, you read that right, happy hour on a Saturday! Rehab has HH seven days a week, from 11-6 I believe. I was a little disappointed to see the discounts applied mainly to booze. All appetizers are $1 off, which isn't much, in my opinion. But that didn't deter us from ordering a huge plate of chili cheese fries for the table to share. (And we saved $1, woo!)   On to the entrees. Us girls ordered burgers, one rare and the other two medium rare. The \"rare\" burger came out med-rare, not really a big deal, but mine and my friend's \"med-rare\" were without a doubt overcooked. Mine came out mid-well, and my friend's came out well done. Mine had just enough juice/pink that I ate it anyway, but my friend sent her dish back. For a place called Rehab Burger Therapy, you'd think the cooks would know their way around a grill and proper temps?! Also, on the menu's description of our food it said our burgers were served with condiments; my Poblano burger was supposed to get spicy ketchup and my friend's was supposed to get a chipotle aioli. Both were absent from our plates and we had to ask for them. Weird. Or maybe I'm just a condiment freak.   Our server, Devon (sp?), was super nice, funny and energetic throughout our experience. He apologized for the kitchen's mistake and fixed the situation for my friend.   All in all I'd be back. The pretzel bun I chose my burger to be housed in was delish, and Rehab's fries are slightly addictive. Perhaps I'll try again at a less busy time when the cooks can pay more attention to the grill temps.",

    "text": "I really want to like this place, having seen a couple restaurants come in and out of the building. It looks kind of like the Bonfire did inside (previous restaurant), but it has a surfer vibe, and upbeat atmosphere.   My boyfriend ordered a standard cheese burger, and I had a green salad and garlic bread because I wanted to eat light. My boyfriend eats A LOT of burgers, it is one of his favorite foods, and when he got the burger the bun on the bottom was soggy. As he checked out the sog, I helped myself to some of his fries, which weren't piping hot. It made me suspect that the burger had sat for awhile before they brought it (note to owners).   My salad was pretty standard, I mean, I did order a green salad so what should I suspect? But, the one thing was that I felt they could have done was sliced the tomatoes. I could tell the tomatoes were the same ones that they used on the burgers, and they just cut them in half, meaning that I had to cut them into tiny pieces myself. I also thought that the cucumbers could have used a chop too. I would suggest cutting the cucumbers and tomatoes into smaller bite sized pieces to make a better salad since that is one of the only fresh/healthy things on the menu. On the first bite of the burger my boyfriend said it was good, but 3 bites later he said something tasted funny and he was not happy. We think it was the onions. He didn't finish the burger.   I might give this place another try, but I am not sure...",

Yes, I tried the wings (I always do) They were awesome. They call them medium but they were pretty hot, I ordered a side of hot sauce and that was great,  No complaints. But you must try the PIG WINGS!!! They are like bone-in riblets, pig drumettes, whatever... with spicy sweet peach hot sauce that is just worth the trip. And the burgers are great, 10 oz is HUGE, Everything cooked as ordered. The Hatch Chile burger was especially good. Staff was fast, fun, environment was full of energy and a very ecclectic clientele which I crave here in the desert. The beer was cold, and the bartender whipped up some specialty frinks that would knock even a seasoned drinker on their A-S-S. Try the blue rufie if you're a wimpy drinker, tastes like candy. Also good is the blueberry martini. YES, FULL BAR. Burger buns were really good, maybe they flew em in from Jersey but AZ never gets bread this good. No complaints ...will be back. Oh, and girls hula hoop in the parking lot if you get bored. They will share.",

    "text": "We here with a friend that had been there a week before. The way he described it put me in the mind set I was about to eat a piece of meaty heaven and a cloud like bun. So we went on a Friday night around 6 pm. The place has a nice chill atmosphere. The wait staff is very nice. We started with an appetizer of Pig Wings, which are little ribs on the bone covered in a sweet and spicy peach and hablanero bbq sauce. They were mighty tasty but took at least 20 min to come out.  Like most places in phoenix, they had Four Peaks beers on tap. This is fine with me. So we had a few beers, the ordered our burgers.  I ordered there specialty burger, The Hangover: Fried egg, bacon and a split green chili on it on a pretzel bun. As a side I choose the sweet potato tots. The burger was cook perfect to my order, but lacked seasoning. Even with a green chili on it I didn't get the heat I was expecting.  The bacon was crispy and the egg was cooked nice. The pretzel bun was excellent. It wasn't a bad burger but it didn't have that wow factor I was looking for.  The side of sweet potato tots was great. They even give you a side spicy catsup. This was good, but with sweet potato tots you need to serve them with a maple, or sweet sauce.   So overall I would go back to give this place a second chance. My friend had a BBQ burger that I want to try. So check the place out. It is worth it.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to come here for a long time because I heard really good things. I finally got the chance and came here for lunch with a co-worker today, but unfortunately I was kind of disappointed. We got there and there was a short wait which was fine and to be expected, but there was literally no where to stand to wait without being in someone's way. (It was raining outside so maybe people normally wait on the patio? There are no chairs or benches or anything.) We got our table within a few minutes and our waiter got our drink order pretty quickly. He was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, made some recommendations for us, and we placed our order.   The lunch rush was starting to end shortly after we ordered, so there were plenty of open tables after being there for 15 minutes. But somehow it took a good 25-30 minutes to get our food. When our food did come out, our waiter dropped it off and didn't come back to check on us for quite some time. I wanted to ask for a side of mayo and another side of chipotle aioli (which was really good) but he disappeared. I finally saw him seating another group and I tried to make eye contact with him several times but he just kept going back and hanging out at the bar. I finally got him to come over and he brought my sauce quickly, but then it was the same thing again with our check. Because it took so long to get our food (which was just 2 very simple burgers and tots, nothing too fancy) we had to get back to work quickly. We finally got his attention and we asked for our checks, but it seriously took another 5 minutes for him to bring it. Kind of frustrating.   My burger wasn't that great. I got the hatch burger and it was just a green chile and a really thick piece of cheese that was not even melted. Nothing else, which made it pretty dry (hence my desire for more sauce). I wasn't really impressed at all. I love the mexican burger at Lenny's and was hoping for something similar but it's really the opposite. The sweet potato tots were pretty good though, I did like those. And I liked the atmosphere of the place, they played a lot of Pepper which is one of my favorite bands, so it wasn't all bad. Overall I wasn't impressed and I'm much more interested in trying some of the other burger places around here than coming back.",

I've eaten here 4 times now, good solid burgers.   Sat on the patio, ordered a couple of Hop Knot IPA and waited for our burgers. Now I don't want to under sell my poblano burger, which was good, but my wife ordered the Peanut Butter and Jelly Burger with THICK cut bacon.  WTF???  The combination of these 3 flavors work so incredibly well together it made me dizzy. I didn't even want to eat mine. Mind blowing good. All the melted peanut butter and jelly that dripped out of the burger and onto the plate made a great dipping sauce for the fries too!!  Out of all the burgers I have eaten in my 40 year old life, this will make my top 3 of all time. Shout out to our awesome waiter Pickle for being so awesome too!",

I wish that they serve the pig wings on the East Coast because I would have those every week. I also had the peanut butter and jelly burger which I know sounds questionable, but it works. It's different and you should try it once you get over the fact that there's peanut butter on your burger. Swing by if you're in Scottsdale because this was definitely one of my favorite restaurants we ate that during our trip.",

I wouldn't recommend getting them. For our meals, I had the Jalapeno Popper Burger and my boyfriend had the Spicy Mac-N-Cheese Burger. The star of each burger is in the name: jalapeno poppers and mac-n-cheese, respectively. I loved the creamy texture of the cream cheese in the burger. For obvious reasons, my boyfriend loved the mac-n-cheese burger (there's also bacon). Both were a good size. I don't remember the fries being remarkable. The real star of the show is the creative burger.    Good burger place. Worth trying out if you don't mind the heartburn afterwards.",

I stayed because with that long of a wait, it must've meant the food was good. I gave it 3 stars because of the wait the first time and the 2nd time was the service! Service first time was great! The guy at the bar was awesome! But the 2nd time of me going I feel like within the first 2-3 minutes I should be addressed. Asked for a drink, or acknowledged at least! And I wasn't. I waited about 8 minutes before someone came to my table. And didn't get a \"sorry for the wait\". It was just like... Ok what can I get you.. And even more bothersome, the couple that came in and sat next to me was addressed immediately.. Hmmm. But she did have a different waiter. Other than that. I would give 5 stars.

Oh, and our waitress recommended the PB&J and I thought she was just being cute, but lots of people(locals) around us were ordering it and I think I must have it.",

They have a huge menu and the burger options can be a little overwhelming if you're indecisive like me. I went with the turkey burger that had avocado, lettuce, tomato, and sprouts on top. It was huge and super tasty. The burger came with sweet potato tots that were warm and crispy and there's a unique selection of sauces to dip your tots in. Some of the burgers have the option of 5 ounces or 10 and the turkey burger only comes 10 ounces, so I wouldn't recommend eating it all, especially if you plan on drinking! I didn't drink here, but I hear the margaritas are strong and really good. I absolutely love this place and can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Rehab Burger Therapy is an example of how sometimes 2 rights can make a....not so right. Burgers? Yes! Mac and Cheese? Would doesn't love it! Jalapeno poppers? Delicious! But everything together? It's just not a burger to me, especially if you have to eat it with a knife and fork. Isn't holding in your hands a delicious piece of fresh, ground cow between buttery, fat buns half the beauty of a burger?  I had the Spicy Mac-N-Cheese burger, and our table also ordered Ghost burger and the special burger, the Loco Moco. My burger had mac n cheese spilled everywhere, and it felt like eating a decent burger with a side of mac and cheese. The Loco Moco burger had rice spilling every where...and rice in a burger? Not sure if they even thought about the logistics of it. The burger itself was mediocre....if you're a high end burger joint, you should have a very excellent burger patty as a base.   Service was ok, I think staff could use a bit of training on at least their specials (I overheard at least 2 servers not know what the daily special was). It is, however, very conveniently located in walkable distance from the Giants Scottsdale Stadium, and a nice post-game restaurant to head to. In the end the food felt like messy combinations of anything they can think of putting on a burger. Fun place, but far from being the best burger I've ever had (Fergburger takes the crown on that, and all burger joints need to take note), and not really a 4.5 rank in my book.",

Soda was thick n syrupy w little carbonation (coke) the tea looked ok but had no flavor at all.  I've seen more flavor in a Lipton used tea bag. The food came out as ordered in a timely manner. And beautiful. A feast for both the stomach and the eyes. So we start eating. And we'll our drinks was empty. For 10 mins n no refills.  Looked around the room and I also noticed that everyone else also had empty glasses with just ice. They don't check up on you during meal.  You have to get their attention and that's hard in such a loud room. So a while passes and our waitress is finally passing by and snagging her attention. But we was already done eating and also requested boxes. Note: the rehab size is a very ambitious serving, huge. So we get our boxes. And pack up the food.  But still so check.  So another 15 mins goes by.  And we finally have to ask for the check. The wait staff doesn't pay attention to their customers for drinks or checks.  Not rude. But definitely not conscientious. Or personable. We loved the food. But next time we gonna try the Tempe location. See how service is there.  As for here it's a one n done. Off note: those of you w kids that are picky, they do not have American cheese. Nothing to complain about there. Just FYI.",

I've had hawaiian burger where the pineapple really set off the flavor chemistry but at Rehab, they didn't use a ripe pineapple and didn't properly grill it to carmelize all the sugar from the fruit.   The sweet potato fries were actually sweet potato tater tots, but I loved them with no reservations.   The service was pretty prompt and friendly, all of the servers looked younger. I really liked the atmosphere too, good music and nice decor inside (it was too hot for me outside).",

I did ask what I HAD to have there and that was the top dog.   PB&J burger sounds gross to me but I forged ahead and damn glad I did. The sweet with the kick of the Siracha was totally on point. I was totally blown away and stunned that I liked it.  I also had the Mac n cheese burger that was phenomenal. The server said \"you might look weird eating two burgers!\" She also didn't think I could do it. I finished the burgers in principle and was full for two days!!! The fries are great the tots are delicious and the soda cup size is large and appropriate. I also liked the Jimmy Buffet feel to the place really chill and welcoming.  This place has enough reviews but I had to put my two cents in, it is a fantastic burger spot!!!",

The corn was really good fresh corn on the cob.  Yummy.  The burger.  Oh my goodness.  So yummy and the ingredients tasted so fresh and healthy.  It was not a grease burger.  Lean beef that looked and tasted very fresh.  I orderded it medium and it came out perfect.  The pretzel bun was a nice touch to it.  This is a remake of the Big Mac, or should I say the way a Big Mac should be.  $12 bucks for this sandwich.  It comes with 2 5 oz. slides of beef.  None of the the burgers here are cheap.  That is the tradeoff.  These people know how to do burgers here.  The staff was wonderful.  Very friendly.  This is not a fast food burger joint.  You have to wait 15 minutes for your burger.  It's more like a bar and grill restaurant.",

However, the food was delicious, service was certainly exceptional, and it was jam packed at 11am on a Tuesday (which can only mean great things). I wouldn't personally get the pb&j burger here again, but I would without a doubt come back for another round of burgers. The roommate loved his burger just for the record! If you're in he area - I definitely recommend dropping in for a bite! Food is cheap, but high grade food and delivery! Thank you!!",

The place had a lively atmosphere and was busy on a Monday night. I ordered the spicy mac and cheese burger and it was out of this world! From the pretzel bun to the tasty patty along with the spicy mac and cheese with bacon it was perfection. As I side I got the sweet potato tots which were the best I ever had. The drinks were great too. I don't normally order margaritas but they had this spicy mango jalepeno thing on the menu and damn was it good. The food and drinks were a hit and the service was excellent as well. Connor was our server and this guy was awesome. He made great recommendations and hustled. He swears by the PB&J burger which maybe I'll try next time. If you are in Scottsdale try this place out!",

Side note: I found out they do not take reservations for a party of 2 for indoor seating. But I'm assuming for large groups there is reservations available.  Now on to the burgers. I got the Philly Cheeseburger 5oz, and Hubs got the Ghost Pepper 10oz. We loved the burgers. Nice and juicy cooked the way we liked/wanted The Philly is amazing basically what it sounds like. I definitely paid more attention to my burger than my fries. But they were good too.  Surprisingly the ghost pepper had a kick to it for the hubs. Which is very rare. This is the guy who likes triple jalapenos on his sandwich and burgers with them being stuffed jalapenos and pepper jack cheese. So he gave it a thumbs up!  Now I know where to go, to get some good burgers!",

    "text": "I've always wanted to try this burger joint and my kids wanted to too. So we came here on a Saturday night. I figured it's a burger joint and Yelp says no reservations which makes sense. It's just a burger. My son got here a little earlier than us and tried to get a table inside but found out you have to make a reservation to sit inside. So he got us a table outside.   Outside is not that big with about five tables and chairs on the railing too. Almost all is high top tables. They had the misters and small fans for the heat in the afternoon. I think they turn those off around 6pm. All I know is the outside cause I never made it inside. First time this has ever happened to me.   I ordered the Spicy Mac n Cheese rehab burger. There are so many options. Rehab 10oz. Relapse 5oz. How it's cooked, bun, and potatoes you want. So I got a pretzel bun with sweet potatoes tots. Man was this good but really filling. Thick and juicy 10oz burger cooked perfectly with huge serving of Mac and cheese falling off the burger. Mac n cheese had bacon bits and it really wasn't that spicy at all. I was barely able to finish it all. Tots were good and love the different selections of dipping sauces they have. Really good. Really filling.   My wife and mom got the Hawaiian burger. Had pineapple and ham between the burger. My daughter got the Hatch. Everyone enjoyed the burger but no one could finish their burger but me and my son. Oh well.   The service was great. She brought out our water cups and drinks right away. Kept tabs on us and our food came out pretty quickly. Can't complain about that.   It was pretty fun eating outside. Nice breeze to keep it cool and watching the traffic go by was pretty interesting especially those traveling bars where you have to pedal while drinking.   So great burgers. Filling. Fresh and don't forget lots of options to make your burger special. Service was great and if you like the outdoors it's great. Otherwise I suggest you make a reservation to get inside. Oh yea there is free public parking just steps from the place so you don't have to worry about where to park especially in Old Town Scottsdale.   Enjoyed it a lot and will most definitely be back.",

Plus a variety of other dishes if burgers aren't your thing. A tip for out-of-towners, parking is plentiful and free downtown.

The flavors and amount they give you are perfect. If you're hungry order the rehab if not order the small one you can't go wrong.   The only downside is you feel crammed in but whatever is what it is and you will still have a great time",

    "text": "My friend and I came by on a Sunday evening (after happy hour unfortunately), but had some extremely tasty burgers that came in huge portions! There's street parking as well as some garage parking (which was free on Sunday).  I got the Backyard BBQ burger (mainly for the onion ring inside), rehab size (10oz) with sweet potato tots. The burger was huge and perfectly cooked, and the brioche bun it was on was so soft and buttery. Sadly, my onion ring got very soggy halfway through the burger, and the toppings inside were slipping out, but nothing a fork (or fingers) can't recover. Next time, I'd probably get the onion ring and bbq sauce on the side. My friend enjoyed her jalapeno popper burger and the HUGE mound of guac it came with - they definitely don't skip with toppings. Her fries were decent, but she def stole a few tots off my plate ;)  Doubling the weight of your burger for just a couple dollars is sooo worth, and we were big fans of the sweet potato tots. I hope to be back soon!!",

    "text": "This is a solid burger joint with a ton of options. Nothing is too fancy about it. You can get a 5 oz or 10 oz burger with your choice of bun and tots or fries.   The tots are great and I haven't gotten them both times I've been in. The pb&j burger was good but I'm not too committed to it and will get something else next time I stop in. You can taste the beer in the onion rings batter which I actually appreciated.   This is more of a specialty burger place for me and if you want just a standard burger there are other options in the valley. However, we all enjoyed our burgers and were practically scraping the last bits off our plates.   Reasons it isn't 5 star:  Menus are hard to read with the bubbly/boxy fonts and small writing. I would suggest getting new menus that are much clearer. The other thing that bothered me was how warm it was. They had fans in there and I assume AC but it was just uncomfortably warm.",

I order the Chicken Breast Burger with Avocado and it was delicious. The French Fries were cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.  The portion was a good size and definitely filled me up!  The ambiance is very laid back and the decor has the beach lifestyle.  The staff were very attentive (Conner did a great job), and they work as a team to take care of the guest.  The prices are reasonable and I will definitely be coming back, next time I am in the Scottsdale area!    Sammy (Inland Empire, CA)",

The French fries are seasoned with thing tangy stuff that kind of takes away from any dip or taste of French fry. The burger was meh. The lettuce was too much and the burger had a somewhat interesting taste. The hostess was super unhappy to be there which kind of was weird too because the place has a nice vibe. Our server was sweet and the place was packed with a cool vibe so I understand why people like it, it just wasn't all that I expected or hoped for.",

I got the spicy mac and cheese burger on a pretzel bun and sweet potato tots. The burger was good, but given the Mac and cheese, it was messy. I didn't mind but just warning others thinking about getting it. The tots were amazing though! Loved them. I thought they wouldn't be that good because sweet potato isn't my favorite, but these really surprised me. The pineapple sauce is the real MVP though. I wish they bottled it, so I could take it home.   I took one star off because the service wasn't very nice. The hostess seemed annoyed when I asked to be seated. Also, the waitress rarely came to us. And when she did, she only refilled my boyfriend's water but not mine even though it was completely empty.",

The atmosphere was very laid back and beachy vibes with great music. The outdoor seating area was great and the inside was nice as well.   Nelson's verde con pollo: 4/5, the chips were fantastic with a nice salt/lime seasoning on them. The dip itself was very good with a nice spicy kick.  Bacon & Blue Burger: 4/5, personally I like crumbled blue cheese and bacon on the actual burger, this one has them infused into the patty. Still a very very good burger just wouldn't be my first choice.   The Porkster Burger: 10/5, this burger was absolutely banging. The pulled pork was so flavorful and tender, the bbq sauce was so good I almost used asked for a separate straw to finish the job, and the burger itself was amazing. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to climax from eating food.   Fries: 5/5, the fries were great and the dipping sauces were all amazing as well (Chipotle Aioli, & Garlic Sriracha Aioli)   Overall I was completely blown away by the food here. The fact that you can sub different types of burgers, buns, & dipping sauces at no additional cost is also mind blowing. HIGHLY recommend this spot. The staff were all also super friendly as well. 10/10",

Everyone had a different burger and the only complaint I heard from the table was that the doneness was on the \"less\" side, so, maybe order med-well if you like it medium?

I asked for my burger to be cooked medium well, but it arrived looking more like medium rare. I hate to send food back unless it's really messed up because I know it gets wasted, so I just ate it as it came. The fries would have been good except for their strange flavor- maybe lime?

    "text": "Yep...this was yummy stuff folks.  We had supper here before heading to The Sugar Bowl for youngest son's first birthday celebration.  Our crew started with the Pig Wings. Mine is a family of carnivores and they were all super happy with these little pork nuggets. I tasted them and they were so good! Very tender and the sauce was amazing.  We all had burgers or some sort. We had the smaller sized burgers since we were headed for ice cream next and they were more than enough (for me they were at least!)  My favorite at Rehab was the sweet potato tots. Pure genius. Served with a little pineapple sort of dip. My baby boy and I loved them!   The decor was relaxed and the service was EXCELLENT!  If you are in Old Town Scottsdale don't miss it!",

We were greeted by the friendliest bartender who was super cool with us taking our time to order. I love the laid back atmosphere! They had Four Peaks Arizona Peach on tap, which I decided to try.   I went with the Port-a-Burger and my boyfriend got the Porkster. I've had a portabella sandwich at a few places, but it's usually nothing to write home about. This was the best portabella sandwich I have had in ages. Smothered in havarti cheese with lettuce, tomatoes and sprouts-all served on a delicious pretzel bun. The sweet potato tots were also quite tasty. My boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich as well, which was massive and covered with BBQ sauce.   The decor is very Hawaiian/stoner-ish. The bartender kept us entertained with stories about traveling to different cities and the owner even asked us what we wanted to listen to! It was a pretty cool experience. Food was great, atmosphere awesome and we were there past closing time. No one ever rushed us. Overall a very good experience and I look forward to coming back and having another Port-a-Burger!",

Way too many actually.    But I waited because the same thing always happens.  When I find a great place, I need to keep it a secret because when I come back, it's bombarded with patrons and I can't get the same experience I had before everyone else found out.    Honestly, I don't like crowded places.  I like to enjoy the experience and relax.    Only 4 starts because I really like the food & the atmosphere, but the place gets too crowded.  The patrons are squeezed in so tightly that I feel like we're all dining together.  Not cool when other customers can breathe on the food you're eating.",

I was craving nothing but a really good burger and heard that the PB&J burger here was the BOMB.COM so I had to have it. I arrived with a large party and was told the wait would be 2 hours!!!! I was so mad but set on eating that burger! After the horrible wait (which was more than 2 hours btw) I got to sink my teeth into my meal!!! I also had the sweet potato tots! My husband ordered the Poblano Burger with onion rings and subbed the regular patty for a chorizo patty!!! The food seriously doesn't get any better than this! Although it really isn't for health nuts, the food tastes fresh/in house made/not crap that has been sitting in a freezer! My new fav burger stop!!!!",

They have clams on the menu which I have yet to get to, but so far I have had variations of their Turkey Burger and have yet to be disappointed.

If you get a salad instead of fries, you might as well call it two salads, as the sandwiches have loads of veggies too! Fantastic stuff. Biggest drawback is the place is always packed. Tip...Ask to sit along the rail on the outside patio. That's up for grabs and you can sit immediately! Works fine for 2-3 people. Patio heaters make it very comfortable during the colder months.

I had the bacon cheeseburger, with the pretzel bun and cheddar cheese-- it was super delicious and really a big burger so I saved half for an after-drinking snack.  My boyfriend had the MacGnarly burger or whatever it is called, which is a double decker burger smothered in thousand island dressing, and he had it on a brioche bun, which was really good.  The fries were good.  The sweet potato tots would have been better if they weren't burned, and if they gave me some garlic aioli on the side instead of ketchup (sweet potatoes and ketchup? Ummmm no)  I also had a spicy bloody mary and that thing was DELICIOUS!  Parking can be gnarly around there, but if you park in the structure and take the super short hike to Rehab Burger, then you'll be fine.  Enjoy!",

The wait to seat 4 people took over 30 minutes which was understandable seeing the large crowd and limited seating available. We still decided to wait and explore the food options. After a long wait we got seated, offered drinks and our hostess Lauren was very friendly, suggestive from the menu list to choose our food. We started of with the chicken wings in medium and gold sauces and some onion rings. Both appetizers were really good, wings being made to perfection.  The real attraction were the big list of burgers on the menu. I went with the Hawaiian Burger (medium) on pretzel bun. The burger was just perfect with little pink inside and it was a huge burger. Along with the sweet potato tater tots (best tots ever. Hands down) this burger has to be among the best I ever had. Altogether this joint made me a big fan and I will be visiting here often from now.  Thank you for the wonderful experience.",

I ordered the 5 oz Relapse Know Poblano Burger cooked medium wrapped in lettuce with the Sweet poToToes.  I was surprised how quick it came out and after my first bite, it was obviously undercooked.  Basically it was lightly browned on the outside and cold and raw in the middle.  I sent it back and it was replaced with no problem, but still more on the medium rare side than medium.  The sweet potato Tots were ok, but I think they could offer something of better quality. I was not impressed enough to go back and prefer the burgers and fries at Red Robin over the Rehab Burger Therapy.",

Great burgers - mostly cooked to specifications (maybe a little closer to medium than medium rare).  The menu is large and difficult to choose which burger you want. I like the multiple bun options. Service was attentive.",

    "text": "If you want a burger where the patty itself is the star of the show, you do not want a rehab burger. Here, the patties are overcooked, under-charred, and under-flavored. The menu offers a wonderful variety of fixins to add to your burger, including at least three different types of buns (brioche, pretzel, and gluten free) and lots of package deals like the Hawaiian burger I had last night (ham, pineapple, jack cheese [I think], and a mostly tasteless liquid claiming to be a teriyaki wasabi aioli) but the beefy taste, if it's there at all, is almost entirely buried beneath the rest. And I say this even though neither the ham nor the pineapple were very tasty. My wife had this problem last time with the PB&J burger, which tasted pretty much like a PB&J sandwich without the burger. I'm not telling folks to stay away, but I think they'll find the sandwich descriptions on the menu more pleasing than what they find on their plates.",

Surfer, bicycle, RC Planes and snowboarding props all around. The music was beach themed and fun. I decided to sit at bar to look at some basketball. The bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable. She let me sample a beer that I havent had before. She was very helpful in helping me decide which burger to choose. I went simple and got the huge burger with 1000 island, The MacSomething.  She upsold me to the onion rings which looked great. I also ordered the pig wings which I knew were going to be too much, but I wanted something to munch on later that night. The food arrived and looked fantastic.  I jumped in on the onion rings first, they had a nice golden brown to them. I got 5 with my order.  I picked one up and it was cold. That put a disappointed frown on my face. They were ice cold. I waved down the bartender and explained to her my problem and she said she would take care of it and get me some more. I said no problem. I decided to go to the burger next. I cut it in half and it was perfectly cooked to med-rare. Happy happy. It taste great too. You could taste the smokeyness of the fire on the meat. Darn good. I tried the pig wing, it was alright. Alittle overcooked in my opinion, but good enough. I received my onion rings and \"Viola\", they were the same ones I had originally except they were re-dropped into the fryer and came back dark and burnt, black on edges. Very un-cool. To the owners, is it really going to kill your food cost to re-cook 5 slices of onions? That wrecked and really affected your scoring.  I was the second person to get my food, it wasnt even busy yet. If you are having staff upsell something, make sure the product is delicious. Sounds like kitchen staff made onion rings before burger, and they sat in window along time. I made sure the bartender and, I think she was the manager or owner, see that I was not pleased with onion rings and left them in clear view. They never said anything. Kinda disappointing considering it was a upsell. By the time I was ready to leave, the place was packed. Understanding the business, I know it takes time to get check. I even stood up to get their attention and the bartender finally came over after 10 minutes and asked if I needed anything else. Place needs 2 bartenders. The woman working cant take drink orders and food orders and then run food. She is not Superwoman, and Superwoman couldnt handle that rush either. You get bad customer service. Which I received.  Damn good burger though. If onion ring problem didnt occur, probably would have given a 4 or 5.",

My wife is not a burger person per say, but really like her's which she ordered on a pretzel bun. I on the other hand love my beef, and the sweetness of the pineapple was perfect. The Pineapple Teriyaki Aioli sauce brought it together nicely. The sweet potato tater-tots where the best!  The restaurant is done in a \"surfer\" theme with one TV showing surfing competitions and the rest showing a range of sporting events. Sitting in the bar you expect to walk out onto the beach.

She came back five minutes later and took the guys order next to me and then took my order. Guy next to me got his fish tacos within five minutes. I waited fifteen to twenty for my burger. I understand a burger takes longer than a fish taco but it was obvious they forgot to grab my order when it was done because when I got it, although it tasted good, the burger was luke warm as were the fries. The real kicker is the entire time I waited for my burger I was never checked on. That in itself will cause me to think twice before eating here again.",

I took my brother and his two year old daughter today and the server couldn't be more attentive and super sweet.  My only recommendation would be to offer a couple of options for kids meals, but other than that...  Try the Hangover Burger or the Peanut Butter and Bacon Cheese Burger on Pretzel Buns!  Yes, I said it!  Delicious!!! Top Notch",

Anyways we get seated at the end of a community table and the food was good. Not amazing, but good. The last third of my burger ended up being too underdone for me so I didn't finish all of it.

I think need to take some lessons from their Canadian neighbors chain cactus club and get a better business model than actual hire enough staff and those that want to work rather than chat.  We waited to be acknowledged at door and then took another time to get us seated. Then once seated we were on our own for a good 15 minutes before any welcome.  Crazy.  Our server was super friendly once he spoke to us.  I expect to be greeted at door pretty much immediately.  There were three servers standing at register at back of restaurant chatting.  Do they know who is sustaining their job.  Obviously not.   Food cam fairly quickly with good recommendations. Server was very helpful and attentive.  Good food. Had calamari and poblano burger with onion rings.  We are pretty spoiled in Vancouver so can't say it was outstanding. Corona Rita was ok as I thought it was usually served with full size corona. At least it is in Vancouver.  So in a nutshell first impression was poor but overall I give it a 3 star.",

The hub ordered a 1/2 Shelby Spinach Shalad (he wasn't sharing).   We enjoyed the Fries (I did not see a Mermaid) and Tots (oh so good).   I recommend the sauces in this order  Peach Habanero, Spicy Ketchup, Chipotle Aioli, Stellar Mustard, Teriyaki Pineapple Aioli.    Like we really needed more so we had the Key lime pie.

It felt like it was a little burger shack in California. I liked how diverse the burgers were. I decided to get the PBJ bacon burger. I'm a huge fan of sriracha, so I was sold when I found out that it came on it. I got the sweet potato tots for the side. To be honest I was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong it was a very unique, and good burger. Unfortunately, it was just that.. a good burger. The sweet potato tots were fantastic though.

I will tell everyone I know to steer clear of this place.  No excuses.  Nobody deserves this  treatment.",

Meat was high quality and cooked as ordered. Burger had a full serving of Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was so good I'd have ate it alone. I had a pretzel bun, overall, awesome burger. My father ordered the PB&J burger which he really liked, peanut butter was more of a peanut sauce. Service was pretty good. Place was packed for lunch. Would come back to try some of the other burgers.",

The guys and gals are laid back with that beach cruzer, surfer feeling.  The founders of Rehab Burger Therapy are Wiley Arnett, Ken Likewise and Denise Nelson, who had been with Oregano's Pizza Bistro for the past 18 years and decided to do their own thing.  The menu is small but the burgers are large.  The meat was fresh ground and not over worked with seasonings. The burger patty was formed perfectly, thick and very moist. The cheese was also perfectly melted. There was a double portion of fries.  To wash down this tasty burger, I ordered a Four Peaks 8th Street Ale. Poured into a clean thick glass, it has a clear amber color with a medium head that laced nicely. Aroma is mild, with some hops as well as a slight malt finish.  I believe the trio knows how to get good food to the table.",

    "text": "Made it out to Rehab.  It was Friday night and it was busy.  We waited about 30 minutes and were seated inside.  Our waitress looked super high but was very nice.  She took our drink order and came back with them promptly.  Then she took our order.    Then we waited, and waited, and waited...and... waited.   I dont know exactly how long we waited but it had to be close to an hour.  I understand you are busy but Im talking wings, fries, and burgers.  Did the blazed waitress forget our order?  Finally our food comes out.  She forgot a couple of our requests but we were so hungry we were just happy to eat something.  I had the hangover on a pretzel bun sweet potato tots and some wings.  The bun was awesome.  The burger was a good size and above average.  The hatch chile was almost flavorless.  The tots were not good.  The wings were hot, crisp, and excellent.  My wife had the hatch burger and fries.  She was not happy with her meal and couldnt even finish half of it even though we were starving.  We both agreed the food is drastically overrated and the service is poor.  So then we wait for our bill, and waited, and waited...and wait...theres our stoned waitress doing some kind of charades with another table laughing and hugging them.  We watched her for at least 15 minutes chat and visit with them.  I finally waived her over and paid and left.  I have been wanting to come here for a long time and have heard great things about it.  Maybe it was a bad night.  Maybe a bad waitress?  Maybe I ordered wrong?  I'm not sure but the food was very average.  Actually reminded me of Islands Burgers.  Both the decor and the taste but with a terrible wait time.    If I was in the area and wanting a burger I'd consider giving it another try but its not at the level of recommendation or top burger joint at this point in my life.",

They have plenty to choose from so you can find one to suit your taste. All burgers, and sandwiches , come with your choice of Skin-On-Fries or Sweet PoTOToes, which are sweet potato tater tots. Definitely go with the tots and ask for a side of the teriyaki pineapple aioli. They make it in house and it is to die for. Perfect for the tots. You can thank us later. If you do choose the fries, get the spicy ketchup to accompany them, its' also made in house.

This place is tiny with a great patio and horrible parking but that is a minor hassle that ended up being worth it.  We got seated and began looking at the menu.  My friend is cutting a lot of things from her diet and was able to get a GF bun.  She was happy that the staff was able to recommend some things she COULD get.  Our waiter was fabulous that way!  I love 1000-Island burgers but Rehab doesn't have that sauce so I opted for fish tacos instead, with a side of sweet-potato tots.  OMG, they were heavenly!  The order was huge so I took them home and had leftovers for a week.  The tacos were great but messy.    We had a lovely time visiting with our neighbors at the next table and I noticed a lot of first-timers and was able to compare notes with them and even share some tots.  All seemed happy with the ambience and food, which says a lot about Rehab's menu selections.  The prices were very reasonable, which is always a reason to go back.  I could make a meal out of the tots alone and will become a regular when I can get a cheeseburger with 1000-Island.  Remember, it's a big deal!",

No, that wasn't an exaggeration.  It's too bad. A lot of the pictures Yelpers post here made this place's food look pretty good. Unfortunately, my burger was pretty disgusting with a grease-covered bottom bun floating in a pool of even more grease. Everything was made fresh, sure, but nothing was really outstanding here. Flavorless greasy burgers, mushy sweet potato tots, flavorless onion rings, all paired up with questionable sauces \"recommended by the chef\".  Oh, and our server was horrible too. Apparently we weren't interesting enough for her to give decent service to, as she let our food sit in the kitchen for five minutes while she chatted up with people at the bar... Then went right back to ignoring us after she had finally served us. Not all service was bad here, the table right next to us had a server that went back to them about 8 times compared to the 2 times our server wanted to grace us with her presence.  In summary: I'm not sure why this place seems to get the most love out of the 100 other burger joints you could hit up off of Scottsdale road, but to people who want something better than below average bar food, pass on this place.",

It took over ten minutes for us to be greeted... that's pretty ridic- if you're busy at least stop by and say hey I'll be with ya in a few. Took another five min for our waters to come, then five more for drinks from bar. Once I had my ketel one I was alright tho since our burgers were ordered too. For how slow the service was I thought the food would've been slow too, but it was the opposite. It came really fast so I was happy. I had the hangover burger and man was it good. Slap any burger with a fried egg on it and I'll be sure to try it at least one time.",

The fries are seasoned very well and the portion is generous. Their sauce game is ridiculously on point. Definitely recommend the wasabi mayo, their medium wing sauce, and their honey mustard wing sauce. Service was top notch. We brought a puppy and all of the staff came out to meet him and bring him water. Servers were so nice and incredibly attentive. This place is a must visit. Can't recommend enough!",

We were staying at the hospital for training, and it was great that this place was just around the corner from us. The interior decoration is like a beach hang-out theme, which I totally digged, but I felt like this would appeal more to party-goers and college students... ANYWAY, we were totally blown away with the amount of choices this place has to offer. I couldn't decided between three items until I finally settled for the turkey burger. (There's actually a PBJ and bacon burger on their menu ) IT IS HUGE! And it was very good for a turkey burger. I really liked the sweet potato tots they gave me, I was totally hooked.  I wouldn't mind coming out to this restaurant again in the future and would say this is definitely a place to check out at least once when you're in Scottsdale.",

When we asked whether we would be able to complete our lunch in the allotted amount of time, we were informed that, after ordering, it would only take 15 minutes to receive our food. So, we went for it. After a table was cleared and care taken to properly clean it (very nice touch) we ordered drinks and looked through the menu. I ordered a Hatch chili relapse (single) cheeseburger (which comes with a choice of sides like onion rings, salad, etc.) and hubby ordered the fish tacos. His was the better dish. While my cheeseburger was really tasty (the beef is incredibly good) the chipotle sauce got lost on the pretzel bun (sauce was only found on the top bun) and I could only taste it in one bite. Overall, I would say that the burger was nothing special. However, the fish tacos (the byline under this menu item states, \"We don't need no stinkin' badges!\") were excellent!! We went over our allotted time by only 2 minutes; everyone who served us went out of their way to get us in/out the door in a reasonable amount of time, and we enjoyed our meal. The only cautionary note is that the noise level is `quite loud' and one toddler who came in with her parents seemed not to be able to tolerate it well and added her crying to the general noise level.",

    "text": "With a daily HH from 11a-6p... this place is def appropriately named. With hippie, beach vibes, Rehab provides a great escape for guests looking for a quick drink or a hearty meal.   Drinks: Personally, I like a beer with my burger, but their HH feature a number of alternatives if that's what your heart desires.   Food: **disclaimer** Great burgers are one of two things holding me back from being a pescatarian so I'm slightly biased.  I asked the bartender and the waitress about their faves & worked my way down the list...  The PBJ & Bacon Burger:  A- amazing! B- better try one ASAP!  I traditionally loved peanut butter on a burger, but was def hesitant about the jelly - I hate grape jelly & adding the J felt like overkill, but it worked marvelously! Plus, the pretzel bun sealed the deal for me. Show your kindergarten self some love & try it!   The Spicy Mac-N-Cheese Burger:  Another combo of things everyone loves. Things to note with this one: A- the mac'N'cheese is fab! It made my super Southern, super picky heart smile. B- the burger is ginormous! I think it took me three sittings to finish it. Come hungry, leave happy!  C- about the spiciness... As a NOLA native, I know spicy. I love spicy. I live spicy. There's def a kick to it, but it's more like a tiny toddler throwing a tantrum kick than a black belt karate kick. Expectation management is everything.   Most burgers come in relapse (10oz) and relapse (5oz) sizes to fit your hunger level.  They offer an assortment of accompanying sauces for pairing.  Fries were standard. You can go halfsies on fries/ sweet potato tots if you like.  One of my friends loved the Know Poblano and my vegetarian friends raved about the veggie burgers. The food is def the highlight at this spot.  Service: Expect goldilocks service at this place- not too great, but yet not terrible. They'll prob get your order right, but don't expect much as it relates to attentiveness.   Ambience: Vibrant. Youthful. Neighborhood bar vibes. Great for solo sipping at the bar, table for two, or group outings!",

We were seated in a community table, a long table that could sit maybe 20 people. Was not my first choice and then when a group of 12 came and sat by us it became more uncomfortable.    I ordered the Hangover Burger which has egg and bacon on a Pretzel bun and sweet potato tots. The burger was huge and delish,  the tots looked to good to pass up even though I am not a sweet potato person.  The service was back and forth,  you would get swarmed one moment and then would not see anyone for a while.   Nice patio area but wanted to sit inside, the decor was fun and one that you would see next to the beach. Reminded me a little of Hodads in Ocean Beach,  San Diego.   Great place to eat with great burgers.  Will be back again.",

That being said, they are done well and interestingly topped.  I had the Jalapeno Popper Burger which was tasty but surprisingly un-spicey.  The Backyard BBQ burger had a tasty pineapple based sauce and a huge onion ring on top.  The last burger we tried was simple with bacon and tomato and onion.  We had the regular fries (pretty decent), sweet tots (sweet potato tater tots that were a little sweet for my liking). Fun atmosphere that can get loud.  Overall I like the place but due to the price ($50 for 3 with one beer) I expected more.",

They're pretty large for the price and better then many places I've been in Phoenix but not all that amazing overall.  I had the Hangover Burger. It was a 10oz patty with cheese, bacon, a fried egg and green chiles with a pretzel bun.   The burger looked fantastic however it seemed a bit light on flavor, slightly bland. Usually when I order a burger with a fried egg I don't need any type of sauce however I found myself dipping it in the ketchup they brought for the fries. The bottom bun became soggy pretty quick and it got annoyingly messy.   The service was good and the ambiance was typical for a place like this however the beer selection was kind of mediocre.   I'd probably come here again if other people wanted to try it but otherwise it was worth trying once I guess. Judging from the reviews maybe I just didn't order the right one or they were having an \"off\" day. It happens.",

We came into rehab burger excited to try these CRAZY looking burgers based off the pictures we keep seeing on yelp and Facebook, and we were not disappointed!   The Scottsdale location gives an island vibe to the restaurant and was packed even when it was on a Sunday night. We waited for around 30 minutes but this place was definitely worth the wait.   I came in hungry and I ordered a bbq pulled pork burger win sweet potato tater tots!  I also ordered some spicy Mac n cheese! The burger was HUGE and it was also super tasty! Be ready to make a mess cause you will definitely NOT be able to fit the whole burger in your mouth when you bite into it.  The sweet potato tater tots are soooo good too! They are SOOO much better than getting regular fries that I need to get this every time I come here!   The spicy Mac n Cheese was also sooo delicious! I know you are probably gonna come in here craving a burger, but if you're with a lot of friends, order the Mac n cheese cause it's sooo good!   Overall this place is awesome for some big freakin burgers that taste great! I'm so excited to try the one in Tempe now!   Tips: Come hungry, cause these are are HUGE burgers Get sweet potato tater tots, they're the best side you can get with your burger If you have some friends with you, try the Spicy Mac n cheese, it's sooo good too!  Be expected to wait if you come for dinner, it's pretty packed in there",

We went for my husbands 30th birthday, only the two of us, and after we ordered appetizers and dinner as soon as we sat down, waited an hour for the wings to come out. People say after us were served their meals before the wings came out... Thank god he liked them. Another 50 minutes later dinner came out and it was cold, not even warm. They offered to remake things, Sarah was lovely, but sitting for 2.5 hours to get food is ridiculous. We agreed to have it remade, and paid for the meal. By that time neither of us were even hungry...it was our first time in, not sure if we will be back. So bummed!",

    "text": "Deliciousness - 4/5 Happiness - 5/5  Wow! Talk about blowing you away.   Right off the bat, this has to be one of the most ideal Happy Hour possibly. 11:00-6:00 most days, and one all-day happy hour on Thursday.   That wouldn't matter if this place weren't SO good. The food is high quality and lots of fun burger combos. Plus it has bucked the trend of high-end burger joints by refraining from shoestring fries (a bane of my existence) and instead, offers nice medium-cut fries that look like they came from a potato. The burger was out of control - a hamburger topped with prime rib and horseradish sauce. Obviously not designed for a healthy lunch, but a real plus for total satisfaction.   Best yet, they have multiple sauces. I love sauces, particularly aioli. I was able to taste 3 (horseradish, chipotle and pesto) and all were wonderful and summarily devoured.  But what really puts this place over is the wait staff. They were all very friendly and attentive. But most of all, constantly busy. I was so surprised to watch the bartender cleaning the shelf they have their display bottles on. In all my years of bar-sitting, I don't know I've seen anyone do that. Seeing how hard working and nice the staff is shows that they are being treated well by the ownership and love what they do. I will never turn down a chance to eat at a place like that.  Two small minuses. I really want to try a shake or dessert, but the burgers are ridiculously filling. And then, the beer selection was underwhelming. But neither remotely earns this place anything less  than 5 stars.",

    "text": "Headline: Mac N Cheese is a push up bra for burgers...if you have to use it, you're probably flat.  I have come to believe that if a burger joint needs to add things like Mac N Cheese and Jalapeno Poppers to their burgers, it probably means their burgers just aren't that great. This holds True for Rehab. I went with my parents and we got the Bigger Beefstro, Black & Blue and the Grilled Cheese (odd choice by mom, but I still love her). The bigger Beefstro came oozing out with havarti cheese and shaved rib eye. It was a beautiful site. But once I dug in, I realized that it just was flat. I could barely taste the burger itself and the pablano peppers were no where to be found. The Black & Blue was the same...I would simply describe it as bland. Overall, definitely not worth the hype or the wait. Even though there are cool shops around to help the wait go by pretty quick.  On a positive note, we were all happy with the chili verde appetizer. It came with great chips and was a delicious creamy mix of green chiles and chicken.   True Rating: 3.4 (Ambience-4, Taste-3, Price-3, Uniqueness-4, Chub Meter-3)",

I am so disappointed in our entire order of food.  I took my family from out of town bragging about how good their burgers are. Boy I was shocked at how downhill the food has gone.  The burgers were dry and unflavored.  I had to add salt which I hate doing.  I ordered the chili burger, super bland.  The fries were not fresh. My niece ordered a turkey burger and they brought a vege burger. My nephew ordered no tomato and they brought him tomato. They didn't bring his onion for a very long time, service slow and it wasn't busy at that point. Plus he told them he has a tomato allergy.  Brownie is super hard and dried out and the pineapple dessert tastes awful.  I'm super disappointed.",

The second time, not so amazing. The macaroni and cheese was cold and the sauce was bland. My girlfriend got the MAC burger and thought the thousand island sauce tasted like Kraft. When I asked for bacon (from who I think was a manager) he came back with BURNT bacon. Not just in a couple of places, but totally black and hard. If he really was a manager, why would he serve a guest something terrible and inedible? We let the server know we were not impressed by anything very clearly and let her know about the burnt bacon, yet no manager came around or anything was fixed on the bill. Don't know if I'll give this place another",

Damn good.  I've eaten at the best bbq joints all over the country and, honestly, the pulled pork sandwich would have been great even without being included as ingredients in a novelty burger.

The place is fun, indoor and outdoor seating with a large inside bar,  and right on the edge of Old Town in Scottsdale so easy to walk.  There was parking across the street as only two cars can park in front of the restaurant.  The food was outstanding!  The PBJ hamburger was my husband's favorite of all he's tried, a friend had the Philly burger, salads were fresh and every bite was eaten.  The sweet potato nuggets are baked and exceptional!  We saw the mac n' cheese burger on the TV review and it was being ordered by several people - if you like mac n' cheese, one to try.  Lots to choose, wings, salads, etc.  Add to your list of \"must try!\"",

Ordered a beer and asked the bartender to change the channel to the playoff NBA game. She said there was a group behind me that was watching the baseball game. I asked them if they were still watching and they said they did not care. I let the bartender know and she responded \"to calm down.\" I waited for 5 minutes as she took another customers order and then proceeded to ignore my request. I then asked again if she could change to the game and she became even more agitated and said she was busy, but would check. Almost 10 minutes later after nothing changed, the so called \"manager\" came over to let us know our table was ready. We asked her why they were unwilling to change to the playoff game and she responded that \"she was too busy and didn't have time for that.\" We then said we would take the check and leave since they were clearly too busy to deal with another customer. I will never be back and don't know why anyone would waste there time here since you can find a good burger at so many places in Scottsdale/Phoenix.",

The bar and the atmosphere were very unique and interesting, but you know you're in trouble when your server doesn't write down your orders.  For our party of 3, to have all of the burgers come out every which way, but correct literally 3 times over is inexcusable! It was obvious after the 3rd attempt, I would need to join a rehab.  The starters which were ordered with our burgers, and recommended specifically by the waitress didn't come out until after the burgers because she said \"you ordered the burgers first\".  What made matters worse, the waitress was too busy to come back to our table after we asked to speak with her. The starters were eventually comped, but we were never offered an apology or an explanation.  For a place with 4.5 stars and this many reviews, for me to give a 1 star review, we must have gotten the 1 waitress not in rehab.  All this talk of rehab, makes we want a drink (but definitely not here).",

Yes, they have a lot of stuff on the burgers, but it doesn't make them better. The service was friendly. The atmosphere was comfortable and relaxed. I enjoyed hanging out but I just didn't love the food. I might go again and maybe try their most notable pbj burger since it's won some awards but other than that, I can find same or better burgers everywhere else.

There are more than a few televisions that also act as a distraction. The menu has an interesting (I use that term loosely) collection of burgers, including a Peanut Butter and Jelly Burger. I was quite curious as to what that was like but not curious enough to risk ordering it and I couldn't convince anyone in my party to order it either - so I guess I'll continue to be curious.

    "text": "Came here alone for a super late lunch. I waited up front for a few minutes before someone finally recognized that I needed to be seated. The place was not busy as I came during a weird time (3:45pm). My server, Kristin, was really attentive. She was informative about the menu and paid attention to when I wanted her to come by. Loved her. I ordered the spicy Mac n cheese burger with a pretzel bun and sweet potato tots with the spicy ketchup. The options for burger toppings are pretty superb.  My biggest disappointment was that the food came out at different temperatures. My burger with the Mac and cheese spirals was warm, but my sweet potato tots were cold. How are deep fried sides cold? I ate the burger as is but told my waitress about the tots. I got new tots, and these were hot almost burnt. The spicy burger was not spicy at all. There were a couple of small chunks of chile, maybe, in the Mac n cheese. Overall, this might have been better had I come at a different time maybe? It was tasty, but kinda disappointing as I keep hearing that it's the best place in Phoenix.",

If you want a hoppin' joint, funky and eclectic atmosphere, fun crowd, great service, with ginormous burgers that earn the title Best Of AZ, go to Rehab. Great flavor to the burgers and condiments, heck even the fries were delicious! Decent selection of beer. Not as much as some other local places, but you came here for the burger anyway. They also have non beef and vegetarian options for their burgers. It's not a super cheap place, but it's not outrageous, and you get MORE than your money's worth.  Added bonus, there were two Pokestops within range of our table, so the kids were extra happy!",

Only minor complaint was the bbq burger was hard for a friend to eat (he said he would have ordered the sauce on the side next time bc the flavor was spot on, just super smothered). I had the Mac n cheese burger-- to die for! My husband had the ghost burger and our kids had plain burgers. We all loved everything and the staff was all on point and very nice.  Sweet potato tots were so good too!  The bill was only $112 for a group of 9, and we were convinced there was a mistake-- nope, just super reasonable prices!! We are on vacation but will be back next time we are in Scottsdale!",

The fries are skin on fries, the appetizer was delicious. He had the backyard bbq burger, I had the jalapeno popper burger. The backyard bbq burger was like one you would get at a family gathering, it was full of flavor. The jalapeno popper burger was good, the cream cheese under the cheddar tasted so good; we both had sweet potato tots, make sure you order a side or 2 of their sauces for dipping. A server at a table next to us took time to go over the menu & told the table about their most popular burgers which our server did not & I wish he would have because I probably would have ordered the pbj burger.",

The atmosphere is extremely friendly. They really treat you like you're part of the family and as a newbie to the area, this really means a lot.   During our first visit, there was a glitch in the kitchen, which delayed our order. Our waitress explained what happened and said that we'd get a slice of key lime pie on the house. We thought this as a really nice gesture... until we realized how LONG this wait was going to be. (Note: The Manpanion and I came in HUNGRY, so to have our meal delayed made us really CRANKY.) Since we finally received our burgers near closing time, we took the key lime pie to go.  The burgers (both times we went) were absolutely delicious! Yes. They were SO good that we were able to forgive the long wait during that first visit. The regular sized burgers are pretty hefty and consistently tasty. So far, my fave is the Hawaiian burger. It's meaty, so next time I'll opt for the smaller size. The Manpanion is all about the Hangover. You MUST have the tots or the fries. A major plus is they give you different sauces! Tip: The pineapple sauce goes perfect with the tots!  This is a yummy place and I give the folks major kudos for winning me over, despite a not-so-stellar first visit.",

    "text": "Went for lunch on a Friday in a small group during the workday.  Got calamari for an appetizer round.  Breading was great, good flavor, and dip wasn't half bad especially when combined with their special hot sauce (I guess they also sell it at $5 a bottle - spicy / sweet).  Each of us got a small burger (they're all available in large / small which is great), but unfortunately each of our medium ordered burgers came back well done.  I imagine such a smaller burger would be tough to cook appropriately, but I would hope that a place that specializes in burgers could figure out proper times on these things.  I had the same issue at another burger joint (not to be named in this review).  That sort of thing just blows my mind.  In the end, we'd prefer burgers cooked to order, but we're not terribly picky.  Everything else about the burgers was top notch.  Our server was very friendly, outgoing and helpful - when she overheard a comment about the burgers (seriously, we weren't ones to complain) she offered to comp the meals which we didn't want - ended up hooking us up with milkshakes (also quite good).  Oh, I can't believe I'm leaving this for the last item on my review - but the sweet potato tots.  Oh, the sweet potato tots!  I'll come back here often for those alone.  The texture and the taste, and the dipping sauces...  Amazing!",

All these great reviews but I don't know, are these people to drunk to notice that there's a lot of things going wrong because of it being close to old town maybe it's the liquor and they just don't care about anything. Well I was fully sober coming into this place. The girl upfront is clueless let's just say that I really don't want to be mean but they really hired a girl who doesn't know anything about a simple job of \"Hi welcome to Rehab burger! How many do you have with you?? Would you like to be seated outside or inside???\" I walk in and she was busy so she tells me she will be right there to help me when she's done so instead of blocking the door because the desk is right in front of the door and it being such a tight place I walked outside thinking she will help me. Two other people walk in and the girls at her desk just waiting.. So I'm like okay I guess she's don't doing what she's doing so after the people in front of are done I walk and she doesn't even take me before them which one makes no sense and she tells me 25 minutes of wait.... I perfectly see 3 tables open.. She also had a low voice so she mumbles and you have to ask her a couple times to repeat herself. She just shouldn't be doing that job I guess it's so hard to do (Sarcasm) so she said 25 minutes my friends getting mad because he sees the tables himself but I say I bet it won't take 25 minutes and he agrees. So we wait outside and she calls the other group in 5 minutes and us in 10 minutes and those tables still being empty she asks me if we wanted to sit at the community table.. I think that should of been a question before us waiting because there were multiple open spots so we took them we didn't even care. We sat and our waitress was very nice and was quick I give her props she should maybe switch positions with the other girl but I think that would make it worse i would probably order a cheese burger and get no cheese and she would probably ask me if I wanted cheese after getting the cheeseburger I ordered... Sorry for the joke let's put all jokes aside. I ask the girl what's the most popular and what's your favorite and to both of those was the Peanut butter jelly Sriracha sandwich. So hey why not let's try it.. One, way to much peanut butter that you can't taste the burger meat.. So what's the point of the meat?? And I didn't even taste Sriracha either it had no spice to it at all.. Maybe less peanut butter so we can enjoy the meat because if not just serve it with just toast. My fries were also cold with it being busy should I have fresh fries?? I was really confused. The prices are good the waitress was cool but the burger I got recommended was kinda disappointing..  And the girl in front just needs to find something else to do maybe make sense.. Next time I come here I'll make sure I'm drunk.",

    "text": "It's been three hours since I finished eating at Rehab Burger Therapy and I'm still stuffed.  I had their Backyard BBQ Burger and when it came out with a huge knife through the middle of a soft Brioche bun and with two HUGE onion rings I thought I was in heaven (with a little indigestion).  The burger was cooked perfect and the Spicy Ketchup rocked.  The fries that came with were just ordinary (under seasoned) but the dipping sauces made it worth the calories.  My mother had the hatch Chili Burger which was equally great mainly because of the chili's, chipotle aioli and the incredible Pretzel Bun.  I don't think I would order another sandwich from here without the Pretzel Bun.  She also had the Sweet Potato tots which which were a great twist on regular fries.  We had a very small amount of room left in our tummy so we decided to split an Orange Milkshake. Great decision!  It tasted like the old Orangecicle from my youth.  It was nice and smooth and not so thick that it gave you a shake ache.  Place was fun, service was friendly and food was outstanding.  Will go back again soon!",

We waited an hour for our food because they had printer problems. As you can imagine 11 starving people wouldn't be too happy, but they tried to keep us busy. Which was nice of them.  I feel like if any restaurant I go to offers Hawaiian anything I have to try it. I love pineapple in my food. Period. My Hawaiian burger came with a turkey patty, ham, and a FRESH pineapple. You can tell that wasn't a can pineapple. They also gave you a teriyaki aioli of some sort. It was yummy. My fries are a bit cold and stale, but I'm forgiving.  I don't plan on ever coming back to Arizona, but I would recommend this burger place.",

    "text": "Let me begin this review by asking you this: you remember that kid in \"Daddy Day Care\" that would throw fits and would immediately become docile and mesmerized when someone handed him a dollar? If you don't know what I'm talking about then I'm sorry that you don't have the same love and appreciation for great cinema that I do ;)  If you do remember that kid then this is exactly what happened to me during my first visit. We came here on a whim. Sunday night trying to figure out what to eat, looked up burgers on Yelp. The pictures by Yelpers looked great and this place was offering a Yelp deal.   When we got there parking was easy, and the place looked neat and clean inside.  We got in with about 40 minutes 'till closing time. The staff was really welcoming and friendly. Ordering was made easier with great suggestions from our server (I took the Hangover with fries while my gf took the Poblano and sweet poToToes  We were set, then waited for our food. About 10 minutes into our wait (maybe less) our server informed us of an issue in the kitchen that would delay our order. She also told us we'd get some key lime pie to compensate for the extra wait. That's good service folks! Our food ended up taking quite a bit. But when it finally arrived we were NOT disappointed.   The burgers are BIG. Each burger comes in two versions rehab and relapse (10oz vs. 5oz). While I was able to handle the rehab I think I could have been satisfied with the relapse version of this monster. The flavors of the egg, bacon, cheese and chile complemented the savory beef well. The patty was juicy, despite my penchant for well done meat. I also had a taste of the Poblano and thought it was very tasty. The cheese used on this burger stood out for me as I like a sharp cheese.  If you are in the area consider giving this place a try. I know for certain, future rehab sessions are in my immediate future.",

I love how extensive the menu is. Our food came out pretty quickly and the favorite among my family was the spicy Mac n cheese burger! Very tasty and I would definitely come back for that burger! Also very well priced and even the build your own burger was pretty good. I wouldn't recommend this place for families with small kids, but I would definitely recommend to everyone else! The only really I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of how cramped and tight the restaurant was.",

No big deal. However after ~ 45 minutes and seeing 4 parties be seated who arrived after us, we decided to ask how many people were ahead of us on the list.  The employee informed us there were still 4 groups ahead of us on the list somehow.  Unfortunately due to this individual's lack of any idea what is going on in the world, we decided to leave.  The food did just look like an overpriced cheeseburger anyway.",

Just be careful because it is VERY messy. Also I got the normal side of fries which were excellent.   Andrea was our waitress and she was SUPER friendly and helpful as this has been our first time there. I am a big burger guy and I wasn't disappointed.

The burgers were huge, delicious, and a great price (especially considering the price of ground beef). Sweet Potato Tots are an amazing thing and I don't know why this is the first time I have heard of them or had them. Beer selection is standard, nothing too exciting, but our wonderful waitress Megan added some shots (with our permission) to our orders that made each drink order unique. Speaking of Megan, she is the most fun and outgoing waitress I have had in a long time.  If you haven't already, go try Rehab.",

The young hostess seemed a little aloof at first as she didn't make eye contact, but she was nice when we asked her a question and a hard worker as we saw her multi-tasking between clearing tables and greeting patrons. Our server was super friendly and down-to-earth and a woman who appeared to be the owner or manager also stopped by to check on our experience, which was nice. There is a mix of a young hip crowd as well as plenty of people over 40 (thank goodness!) and there is a cool, fun vibe here. Not a major deal, but the women's restroom was the tiniest one I've ever seen with barely room for someone to wait without being hit by the door. It's located in Old Town Scottsdale so it's fun to walk around and sightsee in the area as well.",

After reading some stellar positive reviews, we decided to try Rehab Burger Therapy out. Parking was fine, we got into a good spot right away, but as soon as we walked through the door, we were disappointed. We stood in the doorway for a few minutes before anyone noticed us, were sat and ignored for at least 10 minutes. We finally ordered and the server returned 5 minutes later because she 'forgot to take drink orders'. 25 minutes later we were served our food... this is the only reason I gave this joint 2 stars-- the food. The Hawaiian burger and sweet potato tots were so delish, but still didn't make up for the super disappointing service-- after all we didn't lunch until 1pm so it wasn't swamped. We will try again, on an occasion where we have more time bc the food truly was yummy!",

He ordered the Swiss Mushroom Burger and after I took a bite out of it it was really bland. The patty seemed to barely be seasoned and hardly had any savory flavors or high notes. I ordered the Backyard BBQ Burger, and the pineapple BBQ sauce was good as were the 2 giant onion rings, however, the patty was also quite bland and seemed to be seasoned the same way as the Swiss Burger. The Sweet Potato Tater Tots that Yelp users seemed to be raving about was just missing something. They were far too sweet. Maybe it was the batter? Perhaps we just caught them on a bad night. However, the SERVICE was EXCELLENT. Very pleasant and cheerful staff who checked on us frequently and we were also seated very quickly. Our food  arrived without much waiting. The ambiance is fun and inviting with a relaxing, casual beach vibe. All in all, it was ok, but not the type of burger place we anticipated.",

Fun atmosphere, although a bit warm inside for us. The hostess and waiter seemed to really enjoy working there. The hamburgers and chicken burgers were fantastic! How great that there are bun choices, the pretzel bun being a unanimous favorite. Three of our group liked the fries, but I didn't particularly care for some spice on them (chili powder?), which is a slight bummer since I'm the fry-person in the family. But I was very happy with the onion rings and will try the sweet potato tater tots next time. The waiter even said he'd let me try a tater first to see if I liked it... what great service! Too bad I was way too stuffed to shovel in another bite. We will definitely be back; only wish it were closer to home.",

One server in particular stands out above the rest....if you have the opportunity you need to sit in Nick's section. If you can't find him ask for Pickle! He'll make you feel like family and his happy mood is contagious! After eating here and seeing how this place runs, I don't think I can ever go to another burger joint again. If you're looking for a great time and some tasty grub this is definitely the place :-)  -Missy",

I had the \"Relapse\" (small) \"Know Pablano\" burger on a pretzel bun with their standard fries. I slathered about half of the Chipotle Aioli on the bun and left the rest for dipping the fries (Belgian Style...). I savored *every bite*. I drank some Four Peak 8th Street Pale Ale to complement the meal, and afterward had a pleasant talk with a local couple who frequent the restaurant. Friendly atmosphere, good music, clean establishment, and a nice surrounding area. I plan to come back and try their other burgers on future business trips!",

My husband had the PB&J Bacon burger, super messy, loads of peanut butter and delicious! Worth the mess, the Sriracha gives a little heat with the sweet. I had the Hawaiian burger and modified to my preference with a turkey patty.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff. They were busy however our wait was super short. We'll definitely recommend Rehab Burgers to our friends.",

Ended up bringing half of it home which was fine by me because it was also delicious.  Spicy and flavorful.  Not your ordinary Mac & Cheese.  The drink menu is rather basic; nothing exceptional.  But you don't go for the drinks; you definitely go 'cause you're craving a burger.  We went on a Friday night.  Very loud and busy and fun.  Plenty of little crying kids in the restaurant too, which can be a good (or annoying) thing, if that's your thing.  Our first time.  We will definitely return.",

The customer service is phenomenal. The servers and bartenders are awesome and give great recommendations. The regulars at the bar there are super friendly with great advice on what to order.  The food, phenomenal!! The burgers are huge and you get great portion sizes. You can substitute anything with no hassles! Their sweet tots, out of this world!

Then I got the Calimari which is meatier and better flavored than any I have ever had. I thought that was great but then the pulled pork sandwich with fries showed up along with my wife's bacon cheese burger. My mouth was druling over the Bar-B-Q sauce on the fries when my wife made me try her hamburger. WOW! Finally I dug into my pulled pork. In order to understand how good this is you need to know that I am a True redneck that smokes pork, beef and poltry weekly at home. This Bar-B-Q  sauce was so smokey and delightfully spicy that I told the owner he should get it bottled. He then brought me a 20 Oz cup of it to take home for free. Seriously I just went into this place due to the name and I wanted a beer. I will make the 60 mile round trip here regularly because this makes my Bar-B-Q suck in comparison.",

It is exactly what it sounds like: creamy peanut butter and grape jelly melting over a juicy beef patty with hearty bacon slices. There is also a little sirano chili in the mix to further confuse your taste buds. It was served with sweet potato tots and a pineapple dipping sauce. I washed it down with a Corona Rita. I probably won't do this one again, because there are so many other great burgers on the menu I want to try next but if you are a little brave and very hungry, give this one a go.

Had the chili cheeseburger with onion rings - a True fork and knife burger, but everything was great, down to the brioche bun.

It's as if they assume because of their location or the head-twitching house beat in the background, the food and service don't matter all that much.   No so with \"RBT\". I loved this place. We've already been there twice and we will definitely be back. The menu is creative (I recommend the \"pig wings\") and the burgers are high quality for the price. I especially like the \"pretzel\" burger rolls, although I wish they were offered on both the small and large burgers, not just the large.  The ambiance is casual beach-boardwalk with a touch of Maui, complete with fishtank HD screens and tropical slide-show picture frames. It's well done but not over-done. The wait staff is friendly and easy on the eyes to say the least. The beer is extra cold and crisp (no \"old tap\" taste like some other Scottsdale establishments - yuk) and they are good at keeping an eye on the level in your glass. I also appreciated that one of the owners came to our table to chat.  I am somwhat stingy with my five-star ratings, but this place earned one easily. Overall, it fits everything I'm looking for in a casual dining experience.",

Staff was polite and friendly - 4 star. Very few servers, and I found that our server was attending to almost all the tables, which made the service super slow (the forks/knives took about 15 mins to come to the table, the napkins took another 15 mins, the check took around 20-30 mins) - 2 star. Menu had quite a lot of options including vegan - 3.5 star for that. But the vegan patty comes only in 10 oz size, which is HUGE - 2 star for that.

I did get to order my side, sweet potato tots, great choice! The place was very busy and I can see why. I've heard a lot about the PB&J burger and to be honest, I was underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just didn't live up to the hype that I've heard. The burger itself was very tasty, the bun was great, I just think I'd pick one of their other many choices the next time I go, and I will go again.",

Although my hubby had to go with the Blue Cheese and Bacon with ingredients on top (vs the 10oz original which has all embedded in the beef), it was definitely rehab worthy. The sweet potato tots are a bit greasy but great. Thanks to the reviews we chose this place and it was well worth it.  Note, it was packed at 11:45am...it is a popular place and the wait could be long. The tables outside were open yet the heat was unbereable (this coming from an islander).",

Now let's move onto the \"burger\" which is what their known for. Issued for American cheese but the server \"corrected\" me and said \"that's not cheese\", I said cheddar and he said yes. My burger came with no \"cheddar\"! It went back to the kitchen and they just threw on a piece of cheddar that wasn't even melted. On top of that the burger was \"dry\", no juices at all. Maybe I just had a bad experience nonetheless it was my experience. Worst $7.50 burger I ever had. Hard working people deserve better than this as are money should not be wasted on bad food and a bad experience.",

Had a bacon cheeseburger, couldn't taste the cheese, although I did see it. Burger itself had very little beef flavor. Sweet potots were ok, would rather have actual potatoes. Also, they were cold when arrived at the table. It was no problem sending them back for a hot batch, though. Onion rings were cold also. Ghost burger is HOT! Women's restroom is odd, and poorly arranged. All things considered, not worth the drive for me to go back. There are plenty of good burger spots nearby.",

Calamari is for me sort of a barometer of how good everything else on the menu might be, and usually I'm disappointed, but not here.  It was a little different than your normal calamari in the breading, but it was perfect!  Cooked perfectly, not too chewy and had a really nicely flavored marinara sauce to go with it, and two lemons, which is nice.  I saw some of the burgers go by our table and they looked amazing, big and juicy.  I wish we had more time so I could have had one.  Will definitely go back.",

There is a wait to get a table from time to time, it's worth it. The bar topically has open seating. Both fries and tots are awesome, put wings are great and as always, the burgers rock.",

    "text": "We decided to try this place while visiting Scottsdale after reading the reviews and seeing the pictures on Yelp, which all looked delicious. We were seated quickly and got the cheesy green chile chicken dip (not the official name) for our appetizer. It was very flavorful and had nice chunks of chicken in it. Our meals came relatively quickly for how busy it was and as ordered. We were satisfied with the taste of our burgers, but disappointed that our french fries were flavored with lime. That might be the restaurant's 'thing', but we were not fans. And I usually love lime on my chips, tacos, etc. but not my french fries. It wasn't labeled anywhere on the menu either.   But overall, the burgers and service were good. I would definitely give this place a shot if you're in the mood for delicious and/or giant burgers.",

Only reason I didn't give the 5 stars is I called and said we've got 10 people can u hold a spot and she said, come right in, we have space.

After entering the building, I was positively surprise by the environment, and the almost full dinning room. Staff was courteous, and helpful when it come to help picking the food. Started with a half order of chili cheese fries, which was big enough for 2 persons. The taste of it was perfect, definitely the best chili cheese fries I EVER ate... hands down... For entree I ordered a backyard BBQ burger, with a wheat bun, and fries. It came out medium, and just right to be considered the best burger I ever ate. There was no other place in this world where I have ate such a great burger. Price of the food is very cheap, considering the quality.  To the management of Rehab Burger...

The food was really good the place was a nice cali surfer beach style spot and I loved it. The margaritas were good as well. The only reason i don't five it more stars is because of the long wait to get served. We sat at the bar to avoid a long wait and still at the bar it took a really long time to get a menu then to get our drinks and even longer to get our order taken. It was Friday afternoon there was a good size friend but the wait was kinda crazy even for old town. Definitely a place I'll go to earlier or during the week to beat the crowd and get better service.",

Weekdays or weekends - doesn't matter. Also, this particular visit I made reservations because it was my birthday. Kudos for allowing reservations. But the table they reserved for us - a party of 4 - was right near the door. And in August, it's awful to sit anywhere near a door that opens & closes as frequently as this one does on a Sunday afternoon. I was so hot I was sweating & could hardly eat. That's seriously disappointing - especially because I was so looking forward to the meal & time with my friends.   So.... long & short is this:  Food is exceptional  Service is super duper pooper slow Seating by the door in summer SUCKS!",

Obviously a burger is what we ordered.  Our table ordered the PBJ burger, which had a nice blend of peanut butter, grape jelly, and siracha...and bacon.   We also ordered jalapeno popper burger and a build you own breakfast burger. The burger itself is a quality piece of meat that hasn't been frozen.

I was not raving about the burgers, and I wanted to try this place out because it was considered to be best burgers, unfortunately I asked for my burger medium and I got well done, it was so dry and I could taste the burnt spots throughout my burger. That alone ruined the taste of my basic bacon cheese burger, because there was no flavor at all or juiciness to it.  The ghost burger was decent but also could've been made a bit juicier and less cooked. But atleast the flavoring of the cheese and guacamole overcame the dryness.   Just wouldn't recommend going if looking for a good flavorful burger because they are overlooked and have no flavor to the patty.",

What kind of chips and salsa is really to die for? None.  We eventually were both able to sit at the bar so we decided to dine there. The bartender working was a hilarious brunette who kept us laughing and of course happy.   I got the hangover burger, my fiance got the PBJ. The siriracha scared me a bit on the PBJ.

To start with the hostess threw off a vibe like she was annoyed with everyone. She didnt even try to mask her aggravation. We werent even sure if we were suppose to be following her when she seated us, Im still not sure. Because after we chose our little corner on the patio she didnt leave menus and walked away and sat another group (with menus). The food took quite a long time. And was just ok. I can say I tried it, and thats done with",

The food is consistently good and menu is so diverse, definitely not a boring, lackluster burger joint, just the opposite!

My burger, fries, & drink were $14 (closer to around $20 depending on how you tip). They try to make the place feel like your in Key West or San Diego. The burger was OK, the service was average. I feel like, with this place, your paying more just because it's in Old Town, which is totally fine. I think there are better, cheaper alternatives nearby so I wouldn't make a special trip for the food. That being said, if your in Old Town & are looking for a burger joint, Rehab is a solid option.",

This was my first time visiting, and I ordered the Spicy Mac N' Cheese Relapse size (5 oz).  All of their signature burgers offer 2 sizes (Rehab 10 oz-basically 2 patties, I believe).  You can tell their mac is made from scratch and it was tasty with chunks of fresh jalapenos and bacon.  As the waiter says, \"don't be afraid to get messy,\" but flavorful and delicious.  The fries are good as well, thick cut and seasoned to perfection and crispy.  My waiter (Ben) was nice and attentive.  And, I watched other servers interact with their tables and it appears all of the wait staff is that way, which makes for a good place and nice environment.

Also out of gluten free buns as well. Been coming here for years but this was a disappointing visit. Ironic cause they open at 11am on Sundays and our server said they ran out of this burger at 11am... then she laughed and said \"great father's day marketing on our part\". The greasewood burger.. how can you \"run out\"? Has all the same ingredients as the other burgers you offer. Poor planning. One of us in our party is gluten tolerant and when a place who specializes in burgers with buns runs out of gluten free buns and only was open for 4 hours..? Management is going down hill here. I counted 3 parties of 2 walk in and leave cause the wait was \"25-30\" minutes yet there were open table tops. Time to find a new burger place.   Edit: went once more, same terrible service.

I also ordered the mac & cheese, and if you like mac & cheese with a kick I would highly recommend ordering it. Even the smaller size is pretty large so it's good for sharing.

I was pleased to learn that this restaurant offered a gluten free hamburger and sweet potato tater-tots that are not cooked in corn or soy oil. I got my order to go, and called ahead to place it so when I arrived it would be ready. I show'd up 15-20 mins later and my food was ready in the time they quoted me. The staff was helpful although it did take longer than I anticipated to pay.   The burger itself was nothing special, it was bland and had absolutely no flavor, they just grilled a meat patty and put it on a gluten free bun, which also wasn't that great. It's hard to find good food that tastes great when you have special dietary needs. All in all I would have been better off making the burger at home. This is a place hyped up by the locals and over all is OK for the price. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone that wants a really good hamburger. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for bland mediocre food that will fill their bellies but put their taste buds to sleep. Also if you have special dietary needs, you should be ok to eat here, just don't expect anything spectacular.",

The hangover burger is really great. Just messy. The egg will pop when you bite in the first time. I will certainly visit again next time I am in town. Our waitress Melanie was fantastic.",

They come with two dipping sauces, spicy ketchup and garlic aoli. I found myself alternating between the two sauces every other tot. Delcious.

Love the story on the menu of how the place was created. The menu is very hilarious to read. It was not too busy when we got there, so we were given choices of regular table, high top, or outdoor seating. The place is not too loud to have great conversations.   The food was super yummy. The burger was cooked to order. The sweet potato tater tots were a smaller side but they cooked up really nice.   By the time we left the bar was packed. Note this was a Sunday afternoon, before a holiday so they must be bringing in business.  The waitress we had was very funny, her personality was great. I think the service team here helps to make the place outstanding on top of everything else it provided.",

The first time in I sat on the patio....waited 15 minutes for a waitress, then went and found her and asked for a beer....never saw her again. But I am very glad I went inside and tried again. The bartender helped me, apologized for the poor service outside and proceeded to make me a convert! I have been back several times since and the staff and owners are great. John and Reno the bartenders, as well as Denise, one of the owners and a very pretty addition to the place, have all been very friendly and made me feel at home every time.

Cold Beers hit the spot while trying to decide on a burger as there are so many interesting and temping things on the menu..  We got the smaller size each and skinny fries and Tots.  The small burgers are really big and quite a mouth stretcher but oh boy are they tasty and cooked to perfection.  Exactly Medium!  Good Skinny Fries which are great with the many dipping sauces offered.  The Tots are popular but a little too sweet for us. Love that they use local beef and Fresh never frozen.   Overall a great experience and my fav local burger.  Got to try the PB&J one at some point.",

Here's the important part, all I wanted at that point was the sauce. Not the management attention, not the rolling eyes of the judging server, not compensation, free food, sympathy, or a hug, just the aioli that was promised on the description. They took it very personally, like their elderly grandpa was back their flipping those grisly hockey pucks..long story short I got the sauce, the burger was comped.

Our server recommended the poblano and I was NOT disappointed...it was done perfectly and very flavorful. The sweet potato tots were tasty and came with a selection of dipping sauces. This place is worth return visits. FWIW, we went on a Friday night and when we stepped inside to check in the ambient noise was pretty high. We ended up getting a table outside which seemed to have a much lower noise level.",

    "text": "My husband, 6 year old son, and I came here last Sunday and am so happy we tried it out! Large portions are served here, so make sure you come with a vengeful appetite! We arrived at around 3PM and the place was packed. We waited for about 20 minutes. No benches to sit and wait indoors. Not so bad to wait outside around this time of year in AZ. But waiting outside in the summer heat for that long... Yikes! Yeah.. No, thanks! Anyway, we ordered my son a hot dog and fries. The hot dog was massive for the little guy but he put up a good fight. They charge extra for fixings. Luckily, he's a plain old ketchup and mustard kind of kid. I ordered the hangover with lettuce and tomato on a wheat bun and the husband ordered mushroom and Swiss with lettuce and tomato on a pretzel bun. Well... Boy was it tough to wrap my mouth around that giant burger! It's like I had to strategize on how to approach it. Should I take a bite from the top, then a bite from the bottom? It was massive! But so so yummy! Egg was perfectly fried. Runny yolk and all! Oh, yeah! Sweet potato tots were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Delicious. In spite of the long wait to get in and get served... We all walked out 10lbs heavier and 10 times happier.",

    "text": "Well... I've been here a few times and have to write a review.  This place is amazing.  Somehow it seems to get better every time I go.  First couple times I just had like a Hang Over Burger and it was darn good and a little unique with the chilis.  Then I had a BBQ Burger.  Hard competition because ya know, everyone has one on their menu, but I was impressed with their own BBQ and of course, the pretzel bun.  Then I tried the PB&J Burger on a whim.  OMG.  Fricken Amazing.  I mean like amazing enough that I will crave it and have to go for it.  All their sides and tots are great and then I tried the Jamaican corn.  Also amazing and totally unique.  So good I went again last night and totally went PB&J w/ corn.  I had to go back though because I was in NYC and someone who travels to Scottsdale says, oh have you heard of Rehab...  YEAH I HAVE.  Tells me to try the Medium/Gold chicken wings.  So that happened.  Cooked perfectly, sauce was spicy and mustardy and delicious.  Off the charts.  Someone else got the pig wings where were also great.  I'm thinking they ought to put that medium/gold sauce on some pig wings or pulled pork too, it would be great.  At this point, it's going to be hard for me to be in the area and go somewhere else.  Also, I should add that every time I've been the crowd has been good and the service is always great and the people are very friendly.",

Thanks to the flat screen TVs giving us views of tropical aquarirums, surfing movies, bicycles suspended from the ceiling and surfboard memorabilia everywhere, we felt like we were at a beach hut!  The platters of delicious burgers coming out of the kitchen predicted a burger phenomenon!  Our server, David, was very laid back and made some excellent recommendations for us, so we split one of our favorites, wedge salad (dressing was especially tart and savory,) and each ordered a \"Relapse\" (single) burger.  My wife went for the poblano burger, cooked medium as David recommended, with a grilled poblano with provelone cheese and spicy mustard and spicy catsup, on brioche.  I went for the hangover relapse, which included a fried egg, provolone, bacon and spicy catsup to dress it, also on David's recommended brioche bun.  We drooled as we ate they were both so tasty!  For a side item we both selected the Jamaican corn on the cob, a full cob grilled with island spices and wonderful.  Top this off with two happy hour beers each, the local Four Peaks 8th Street draft pints, and this was a perfect meal and we were seated immediately (kitchen was a little slow,) but got our bill and got to the theatre two blocks away with time to spare.  Can't wait to go back and try another taste sensation!",

My boyfriend and I practically lived at this place during a particularly rough semester when we needed to treat ourselves to some good burgers and drinks on a more regular basis. The owners are extremely friendly and can always be seen walking around making sure everything is up to standard. The chef is an awesome guy, we had the pleasure of talking to him for a bit during on of their slow times. I love meeting people who are passionate about what they do and no one has more passion than a good chef. He was excited to hear what we had to say about to food and even gave us samples of some of the dishes we had not been able to try yet. If you go on a weekend or during lunch time, expect a little bit of a wait. But trust me it's worth it. And if you go on a Sunday, I would HIGHLY recommend their Benedict Burger! A thick slice of ham on a patty with a nice big egg on top, tucked into a pretzel bun and drowning in home-made hollandaise sauce!!! The next Sunday I have off will be spent devouring one of those bad boys.",

We decided to take our chances and stay and I'm so glad we did.  When we thought we weren't going to make it, the waitress offered to make our lunches to go.  We got our food - gulped it down and made it back to work.  They even brought to-go boxes with the food just in case.   Now, we would have gulped it down even if we weren't in a hurry because it was DELICIOUS!!  My medium burger was perfectly pink and I want more!!  My friend's medium well was also perfect.  The onion rings were beautiful and scrumptious.  Fries were great.  I'm sorry none of us orderred the \"tots.\"  They looked great walking by.  I'll have to go back soon to try those out.  So, environment (tvs, sports, surf board, flip flops) - Thumbs up!  Food -Thumbs up!  Service - I'm out of thumbs so they just get a good tip!!  Thanks for a great lunch and great service.

My opinion is clearly in the minority since we arrived on a Tuesday night in July to a restaurant so a full of patrons that we had to sit outside. Perhaps the combination of the full house and the 4.5 stars on 792 Yelp reviews raised my expectations too high.  The service was a bit slow, which may have had to do with the big crowd in a weeknight, however I wouldn't say it was terrible. The food menu had a wide variety of choices but as a craft beer lover I was disappointed in the beer choices. There were mostly macro breweries with a sprinkling of craft beers, which left limited choices for my taste.  I ordered the pablano burger, which was good but I didn't see why the place was rated so high as I can think of several other places in town that make a better burger.   None the less I indicated to my girlfriend that I would go back and had already decided on a \"3 star\" Yelp rating as the food was good but didn't blow me away and the service was a tad slow but acceptable.  Then I went to the restroom and discovered that THERE IS NO MEN'S ROOM. They have a ladies room and a family restroom. So I had to wait a LONG time to use the restroom. I will not go back to a restaurant that expects me to spend my money there but will not provide me with a restroom.",

The sauces for each were very tasty. Atmosphere is more of a bar so it's probably not what I would call a family restaurant, nor is it meant to be. Prices are reasonable and service was top notch. This was our second time there and won't be our last. Was it worth the drive from Gilbert  just for a burger? Absolutely! Have to try the mac and cheese... looks yummy.",

When the food came out, the burger tasted very plain and to be honest it did not have a fresh taste and it wasn't juicy like I expected it to be. Very dry and tasted microwaved. Our waitress was very distracted. She was taking our order and her focus was on other things. Our Mac and cheese that was supposed to be our appetizer, came out the same time as the burgers which irritated me a lot. The look of the Mac and cheese looked tasty but as soon as k tried it, it tasted very plain as well! Overall, I do not think I will come back to this place but it's always good to try new places.",

The atmosphere is friendly and the service has always been on point for us.   The menu is amazing, the variety of burger options is so great. We always start with the calamari - it's exceptionally yummy for a burger spot (order a side of buffalo sauce with it if you love hot sauce, their buffalo sauce is delicious). I've tried at least four of their burgers if not more and they are all perfect. My roommate always orders the PB & J burger and won't have anything else. I usually just get a classic burger with bacon, yummy cheese and a pretzel bun. Always get the pretzel bun, people. I love everything about Rehab besides the nap I need to take when I leave ha. I'm not kidding, go to Rehab Burger! And try all of their sauces too :) -- forgot to mention that above.",

The hostess (with too much eye makeup) was by far the best employee they have on today. She was running around and helping everyone, while doing her job perfectly.   I ordered the 10oz Hatch Chili Burger, medium rare, with fries and a Dr Pepper. The bill was $13 or so before tip. The burger was cooked perfectly, red and juicy. The burger was not seasoned or very little. I tried a bit of salt but it was still lacking. The chili and the cheese were good, the brioche bun was good. The whole thing as a burger was a bit bland. I used the Chipotle Aioli to season the flavor a bit.  The fries were forgettable and were on the colder side when we got them.   Overall, I did like the place, I would go again. I would just ask for salt and pepper on the burger and a salad indstead of fries.",

Our waitress was so fabulous and friendly and very helpful.  Appetizer: You MUST order the PIG WINGS. Don't think twice about that. They are all meat (no fat at all!) and fell right off the bone.  Burgers: - Spicy mac n' cheese burger was AMAZING!  - The Porkster burger was even more amazing! Get this one if you can't decide between these two. - Get the 5oz relapse size (rehab is way too big)  - Order the sweet potato tots (SO DELICIOUS)   Great food, great service, and great atmosphere.

Everything there that we tried was really well made, especially the onion rings that can be substituted in.   Our other family got BBQ pulled pork sandwiches and the pulled pork was amazing! Definitely a good choice and there was quite a large amount of pork justifying the price.   My main complaint is that the location is pretty small which would not be a problem but the time we went there, it was packed! Which in the end is a good thing since everybody knows how good it is. The service was also really timely and observant of our drinks and helped specify some items on the menu.   My major complaint is that the Spicy Mac N Cheese Burger was not spicy! It had only a little dollop of sriracha on a bit of it but they definitely could have done better with the spiciness level. Still tasty though!",

    "text": "Food is pretty good, but you made a poor choice with one of your servers. There's a guy who works there, best way to describe him is by what I believe is a half-sleeve tattoo.  He wasn't friendly, or at all accommodating.  It's frustrating to go out for dinner and have a server ruin your meal, when you're just trying to have a good time. Rarely do I ever comment on a server, as it takes a lot to really irritate me, but this guy needs some training and how to provide a basic good customer service experience.     Our group could not figure out why he would act like that, when clearly servers should know that friendliness pays, and the tip could be affected if they treat our group like crap.  Please see that he undersrands how to better treat your paying guests. Thanks",

Never had a burger here that I haven't liked, but the PB & J bacon burger is on another level!  ONE OF the best if not the best burger you will eve have.  This is my favorite spot in Scottsdale and they just opened another location in Tempe.  I've MADE at least 10 people try the PB & J bacon burger (a few of them against their will and everyone agreed that it is one of the best burgers they've ever had.  I know it sounds like it wouldn't work, but try it.  I can't stay away!!!!",

If there were a way to give 10 stars, Rehab Burger Therapy would absolutely deserve it!   The burgers were inventive and delicious (we tried the Jalepeno Popper and PBJ and Bacon burgers- trust us the PBJ is WAY more delicious than it sounds), the brews were icy cold, the service was phenomenal, the restrooms immaculate......we seriously could find no flaw with this place. You have to come check it out for yourselves, and need some Rehab from your newfound addiction to Rehab Burger Therapy!",

No watered-down margarita here.  The burgers exceeded our expectations. Husband had the porkster - a perfect blend between a cheeseburger a and a pulled pork sandwich. He loved the pineapple the waitress recommended to add. I had the jalapeno popper burger. Cool avocado and spicy poppers on a great cheeseburger. Sweet potato tots for both of us. Where have those been all our life?  Hubby was driving, so I enjoyed a second margatini - and then a nap when we got home. This place was super!  Service was great, and we will go back.",

    "text": "Very cool burger joint, complete with a full bar and plenty of cold brew selections. The menu, however is the star of the show with a featured PBJ Burger that comes with Sriracha sauce...are you kidding me?  I joined some fellow Yelpers last night for a birthday shenanigan shindig, and we had to keep adding tables as our group of about 20 kept growing, and it seems like a popular party place, for an even larger group took up the center of this bicycle and surf board ceiling hanging therapeutic pub. Plenty of therapy was provided, too, as the servers were hustling, but also taking time to be a part of the crowd, friendly and personable...I like that.   I inhaled the Spicy Mac-N-Cheese Burger, medium well, with a side of their sweet po \"TOT\" oes...so yummy. It wasn't too spicy, either, with just enough poblano peppers to give it a kick. Not usually a big-burger fan (size-wize), so I got the 5oz'er, which is referred to as a Relapse. A larger version, the Rehab 10oz was available if you happen to need that type of therapy!  My Speech Therapy (great way to describe the effect alcohol may offer) was the first thing on the menu, a Kimmy Special...a grey goose and lemon refreshment that went down smooth like water. I could have had about a half dozen, but thought better of it, for I was reminded of our county's' famous TENT Therapy, which is offered to those who forget how to drive.  Great spot to bring visiting out-of-towners for an original, and fun burger hangout!",

I've gone a couple times and ordered burgers I wouldn't normally try. A peanut butter and jelly burger? Sounds well..a little unappetizing. Let me tell you how absolutely delicious it was! It had a combination of flavors I never knew I always wanted, if that makes any sense. The way my server explained the details of this unusual burger left me begging to try it. It really was that good! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was really crowded ( for the reasons I mentioned above I'm sure) and it is a smaller establishment. This made it a bit stuffy.  Other than that it was pure pleasure!",

We had the salsa and chips for an appetizer, while I ordered a frozen margarita and my husband had Kiltlifter.  The problem arose with our son's order. It turned out that they were out of the bread they usually use for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. We were given a choice of sourdough--which our server said most kids aren't crazy about--and brioche. We were hesitant, but decided to go with the brioche. It ended up just being way too thick for the kid to handle. We let him pull it apart and scraped off a lot of the filling, but the thick bread with PB was just too much. He couldn't manage more than a few bites. We were very pleased that we were comped for that sandwich without even us requesting it. The restaurant handled the whole matter very well.  Meanwhile, the grown-ups were delighted with their food. My husband had the Hatch burger and was in complete bliss. I had the Shelby's spinach salad with added chicken, and loved the blend of flavors. The chicken breast was perfectly grilled and quite large.  We'd definitely come here again, and maybe our son could have the PB&J, too!",

My deep love of cheeseburgers and the high reviews here had me convinced that I just HAD to pay a visit.   We arrived around 7pm on a Wednesday night and the place was pretty packed. After a 10 minute wait we were seated. Our waitress was friendly and quickly available. We ordered a couple drinks and a burger each. I opted for a Corona-rita and the Hatch burger, my friend ordered a Mike Tai and the Hangover burger.  The drinks were alright, my friend felt that hers was sickeningly sweet and mine was good, but nothing to write home about. Our burgers arrived quickly, hot off the grill and each with a large serving of fries. The burgers were good, although the bun on mine was fairly burnt in a few areas. I was happy with the food, but I wouldn't consider it amazing.",

When we got there for an early lunch, they weren't busy at all, but the hostess tried to sit our table of 6 at a table for 4, just squeezing extra chairs in.  We had to complain to get moved to a bigger table.  Service was SLOW!! We waited forever to get our order taken, then after 30 minutes when the food finally came they hadn't even put my husbands order in to the kitchen, so he had to wait FOREVER to get his food, we were all done eating when it came out.  The food was ok... I wanted a lettuce wrapped burger but they were out of lettuce so that was kind of a bummer.  Also I ordered well done and my burger was really pink in the middle.  Overall not impressed, will not be back.  I'm not sure why so many people like this place!   *** also to those asking if this place is kid friendly I would say it depends on the kid.  They have no kids menu, and it is LOUD in here.  My almost 2 year old didn't like the loud music.  Also they tried to seat us as a bar height table and stack 2 high chairs for him to sit on, I don't see how that is safe.",

It was our first time in and he explained the \"run down \" of how this place operates! Either you're gonna Relapse or Rehab!  Had the wings, offer a few different flavors and options, they were good!  Outstanding burgers, the best order in our party was the Hangover & BBQ burger. Suggest ordering your patty medium! I also suggest- getting the onion rings, a little more costly, but well worth it!  The atmosphere here is really cool, kinda a beach style scene!  Only downside: an extremely long wait after placing our burger order. However , do to the service we received & how often our server check in with us, we'll let that slide! Also, I wasn't to impressed with my Gnarly Burger. It was sorta plain, nothing special  & just average tasting. When we come again I'll try another burger they offer as they have many different options.",

The atmosphere is very cool- causal and fun, and the outside seating would be prime if we came during the day.   The hostess was very friendly and our waitress was so nice. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and even helped with suggestions when we weren't sure what to try. She checked on us numerous times throughout our meal to make sure we were doing ok and to make sure we didn't need anything.   The unique variety they have for burgers is awesome. They have mac and cheese, PB&J... you name it they have it. The PB&J burger is amazing. You would think it would be a little strange but it's awesome and has a great taste to it.   We ordered chips and salsa to start and the chips were very fresh and crispy. The salsa was great but it had a little bite to it. I'm a plain jane so I ordered a cheese burger but it was absolutely delicious! My sister got the mac  and cheese burger and it was great.   Overall great restaurant, cool and causal atmosphere, friendly staff and great customer service. Would definitely recommend!",

I got the hangover burger and the pepper was grilled, the egg wasn't oozy, the meat was juicy (medium), it was a good burger. I would say it's more on the pricey side, but it's worth it!",

Someone at our table was once an alcoholic, I feel it's completely inappropriate to whine because your bill won't be higher than what you want since alcohol isn't involved in the initial drink order.  Then once the other members of the party decided to have a celebratory drink, he asked how we wanted it and interrupted us to let us know it's one way or no way. I'm sorry, who's paying this bill?   Your food could be free and it excuse the awkwardness at our table from one of your employees. Not sure if he enjoys attempting this hard ass front but it's not cute.",

However, when my Hack Burger came out, it was HALF the size of the others, dry, overcooked, the bacon I requested was missing (as well as the extra aioli sauce I requested) and the waitress brought me the wrong beer as well. She didn't earn a good tip that's for sure, since apparently refiling water was too hard as well.   Although I was not impressed with the service or the burger they brought me, I will say that I think I just had bad luck because my boyfriend's burger was amazing and much more what I had originally expected to get. If I had gotten his burger, I would have been leaving 4 or 5 stars. Give this place a chance, but don't be surprised if you have mediocre service or have to ask them to fix your order.",

UGH, it's like eating mini ribs that were cooked perfectly!!!  ya, the burger is good too. is it the best i've ever had? nope. BUT would it be a place i would come back again to order a burger from? yes. the burger wasn't overly juicy, the patty wasn't super thick so u can taste the rest of the burger, and the buns were good too. maybe if i ordered a burger with one of the house sauces it would have taken the burger to another level. that is exactly what i did when the server asked if we would like additional sauces so do it. ask for additional sauces.   the sweet potato tots were pretty good. i'm not a sweet potato fan myself but my gf is so we ordered it. it wasn't as crispy as i would like it but it was crispy enough. i do like how they were perfectly bite sized though.   the mac n cheese was alright but it's not something i would order again. it wasn't bad but it wasn't exactly great either.  service was very friendly and in a great timely manner. our server was very chill and attentive which pretty much set the mood. i wish they had one of these places in the bay so i can pig out on those pig wings with a beer while i watch a game.",

This place had the WORST service that comes to my mind in the past two decades.  My wife and I walked in when they opened for lunch.  (Keep in mind they were not busy at the time.)  Not a single welcome from the staff, so we sat ourselves.  When some of the other staff finally decided to finish hanging-out from behind the kitchen, our order was taken from some obviously hung-over dude who was WAY too cool to take off his sunglasses.  Not only did it take forever to get our food, but the sweet potato tots were bland and terribly soggy.  The burgers were sub-par, and left on our plates not worth taking home.  Our server came to our table exactly three times; to take our order, deliver the slop, and drop-off the bill.  Our drinks were NEVER re-filled.  There is NO HYPE to checkout at this place.  They don't even deserve a single star.  Spend your money elsewhere if you want better food and service.",

We ate the MacGnarly burger from the recommendation of the waitress (she said it was their version of the Big Mac).  It seemed like everyone in the restaurant gasped when she placed it in front of me since it was easily over half a foot tall.  It was messy, difficult to eat and the flavor didn't blow me away.  Now the PBJ burger was a different story.  I ordered it on the recommendation of yelpers and was very scared to eat this burger that was dripping with hot peanut butter.  I have to say though that I was pleasantly surprised and gobbled that thing up.  I also enjoyed my friend's pulled pork sandwich which was spicy and the onion rings.  The sweet potato tots were a little bland to me.  All in all a cool place and would love to go back when I'm in town again.",

Other people around me had it and it looked good. I felt it was way too much food for me.  It was one of those meals that started out great but by close to the end of it I was getting a little sick of it. Maybe I would go for the smaller burger next time.  Service was friendly and prompt.

    "text": "You must try the new Chorizo-Beef Patty!!  There are rarely new flavors in the Scottsdale culinary world but today, with the discovery of the Chorizo-Beef  patty at Rehab Burger, I can honestly tell you that your taste buds are in for a brave and fantastic treat!  When I was a kid, my grandmother would wake me up with the smell of chorizo and eggs, frijoles and homemade tortillas.  Mama did not call for me, her food did.  The aroma and crackle of fresh chorizo and eggs beckoned me to the kitchen where I would enjoy the spicy flavors of her homeland. Today, with the style and flare that only Rehab Burger can muster, a new chorizo con beef patty replicates the taste that heretofore  only could be found in my grandmothers East Los Angeles kitchen.  You can order any of the burgers with the Chorizo-Beef patty, but I chose the Pablamo Burger.  Wow!!  Ken prepared my burger medium, and it arrived just as it should, with just the slightest pink in the middle. Served with an egg on top, bacon, cheese, a sweet Pablamo pepper, and sauce... the flavors were amazing!!  So many different tastes burst into my mouth, and the spicyness of the chorizo arrives late, almost as an after-taste... so subtle but unmistakable.  Normally I can't finish one of Rehabs generous plates, but this flavor was so inviting, I kept picking up that burger, bite after bite until it disappeared.  Want a burger you can truly call unique and special?  You must try the Chorizo and Beef Patty now! My Ma Ma is gone, but the special taste she produced each morning in her East Los Angeles kitchen lives on! Thank you Rehab Burger for the flavor and memories I thought were long lost!",

This burger was one of the best burgers, if not THE best burger I've ever eaten.  The portion was huge (included fries) for $12.50 This burger has bacon and blue cheese mixed into the patty and it was outstanding.  This burger was way better than I expected and I love the fact that I only have to drive 45 minutes to get an outstanding burger.  I also need to say that the service was excellent.

I always come during lunch and get great service and I thought it would be the same during dinner. It wasn't. We had an elderly server who seemed very forgetful and flustered. I arrived at 4:30pm this past Friday When I first walked in letting my friend, it took her about 10 mins to realize I was there to take my drink order.   We ordered our entrees right away, however when our food came out, she didn't bring any napkins or utensils. She came by and asked if everything was good and I asked for some silverware, she said she would be right back. She never came back. 15 mins later, she comes back to refill by water but no utensils. I couldn't eat my side salad cause I had no fork! Not to mention no napkins to wipe my greasy hands! I went to the hostess and asked for some.   The server took a bit to give us our check, we asked for two checks, she came back with one check. Okay fine, we'll split it no big deal. But she took a good 15 mins to get it, my friend moved it to the other side of the table for her to see we were ready. Another 10 mins go by and she hands us the check... We then realized there was no merchant or customer copy, she never swiped our cards! So we had to wait again for a while until we got her attention again to swipe our cards. Her response was, \"I've done that to two other tables just now too!\" Good thing we're nice people and didn't dip out due to her mistake.   I will still come back but I hope I get better service.",

    "text": "The previous restaurant in this space didn't last long, but Rehab Burger Therapy hit the nail on the head!  They have a great menu of food and drinks and some really tasty beers. There are about a dozen different burgers on the menu and the cool part for me (not a beef eater) is that you can sub in a turkey burger or chicken breast, instead of the beef, for no charge! You also get your choice of bun, and any place that offers a pretzel bun is a winner in my book. Burgers come with skin-on fries or sweet potato tots, both of which are really tasty.  They also serve up a half dozen or so different dipping sauces for your potatoes.    I had their wings on my first visit, in 2 different flavors ... the medium and the Gold Medal sauce.  Both phenomenal!  On my next visit, the server suggested to a friend that his favorite was to mix those 2 flavors for one amazing sauce. I believe it... I'm still sorta day dreaming about those wings.  Mmmm, wings. On this visit I also had the wedge salad as a cooling agent to the spice. This was probably the largest wedge I've had in a while.  It also had about 3 pieces of bacon in large chunks all over it. So good...   Second visit I had the Porkster burger ... I felt like a porkster after eating it! This burger is topped with a heap of pulled pork in their peach-habanero bbq sauce (I subbed in the chicken breast) and cheddar cheese. It is nothing short of magnificent. I ate the whole darned thing, but had to sacrifice and not eat my tots.   The happy hour pricing could be better, but their margarita is pretty delicious and warrants me ordering it again. This is a fairly small place, but its intimate and not too noisy.  I like that they have serene underwater footage playing on the tvs and not just sports blaring at you from every angle. Its pretty peaceful.  And the service here is outstanding.  Both times my servers have been uber-friendly and eager to get you anything you need.  I will be back!!",

The most unique was the Peanut Butter & Jelly with Bacon Burger.  Not a normal combination for a burger....but it was AWESOME! I had a Patty melt w green chili....very good.  It was a bit crowded....but it was also lunchtime on a busy Saturday in Old Town. We only had to wait about 20 mins.  Waitress we had was great and attentive. Nice family atmosphere or great for a date.  Reasonably priced and definitely enough food for your money.  I'm ready to go back and try something else from thier menu!!!",

    "text": "This may be the only restaurant where you can order and receive a RARE hamburger with no argument over company policy! That goes a long way with me. The taste of the meat itself is good but not quite as tasty as Red Robin's Angus beef. Two negatives: (1) The wait staff is so crazed serving drinks that they have no time to check on you once your food has been served. And (2) Like What-a-Burger, Rehab also has a strange and annoying FETISH about condiments. Like What-a-Burger, there are no ketchup bottles. Rehab gives you a little cup of ketchup which is not enough. At least What-a-Burger let's you take as many of their silly  ketchup packets as you want. At rehab, the waiters are too busy and the place is too loud to get their attention for more ketchup. Any restaurant manager who refuses to serve ketchup in bottles has a screw loose and should stop the childish nonsense. Do you hear me, Rehab??",

We both ordered medium well but my wife's had more pink than mine (and she shies away from pink in the burger).  Mine was unique and tasty but not blow-me-away tasty.  My wife said she thought it was very similar to Cild Beer and Cheeseburgers (the restaurant).  We may go again but are still searching for our \"favorite\" new burger spot since relocating to the area last summer.",

    "text": "Rehab Burger Therapy helped me turn over a new leaf. It honestly changed my life!  My name is Bobbi Billard and I was a Boring-aholic. I went to the same restaurants and I ordered the same thing every time. I was about as vanilla and predictable as it gets. And then I went to Rehab Burger Therapy and expanded my horizons. Mind blown! BOOM!   What?!? You mean there is a place where you can go to that actually combines a burger with bacon and adds some oooey gooey peanut butter and grape jelly with sriracha sauce to it (PBJ & Bacon Burger) and you will try it out and not only will you not get sick, but instead you'll think it is out of this world AMAZING? Like it will become the stuff you dream about and can't get out of your head, until you go back and partake in it again? No flippin way, guy! I'm \"Same Girl\"! I go to the same places and order the same thing, every time, like a broken record... I'm scared to venture off the beaten path. I may get lost and never find my way home. Yep, I was a real snoozefest! *Zzzzzzzz!*  It took a little coaxing for them to get me to realize the errs of my ways & maybe it was the fact that I was feeling adventurous because I was on vacation, but once I got on the same page as these people, my life, as I once knew it, was never going to be the same! I've seen the light! This place was so magical that pigs can even fly here. Im not kidding! Order the Pig Wings and you'll see for yourself.   No going back to Boringville now. All it took was a little trust and faith and I've forever changed, 100% for the better. I am no longer \"Same Girl\" and I'm now a recovering Boring-aholic. Admitting that I was one was the first step. I owe many thanks to John (the bartender) and Rehab Burger Therapy. Special shoutout to the other Yelpers for suggesting this place and what to order in the first place! Jon... Black 13! It's on! See ya soon dude! And THANK YOU for saving me from my boring ol' self!!!!!!",

I opted for the coconut porter which was yummy.  We ordered the chili con Fritos appetizer which took a while to come but it was worth the wait. The chili was good and just spicy enough. I opted to the special burger a bacon blue cheese burger. I ordered it on the brioche bun but it came on the pretzel bun instead. I'm going to call this a happy accident because I loved it.  The service was a little slow but it was really busy in there. The food was reasonably priced and very tasty. I would definitely return and may be dreaming of that pretzel bun..",

    "text": "This burger joint is pretty awesome. Very casual, family friendly, yet at the same time got the beach bar/sports bar vibe. Friendly staff and lots to choose from on the menu. Got some crazy burgers like spicy mac n cheese, pb&j, the hangover, etc. I went with the jalapeno popper on pretzel buns, 5oz, with potato fries. My burger came with guac and fried egg. Mm mm, SO good. 4 different sauce they give you on the side are amazing too. My favorite was the spicy ketchup. Overall, I left the restaurant feeling full, satisfied, and happy.",

My guest had the pesto pasta, I had a bacon cheeseburger, subbing for blue cheese crumbles.  As always... You didn't leave room for any disappointment.  Thank you!  See you again soon!",

First off, gluten free and customer service are my issues and this place is solid on both these issues. The creative manner that they can make a burger is spot on. The servers were helpful and professional.   Definitely try the spicy Mac and Cheese, my son absolutely loved it.   Parking can be a little challenging but the lot next door was available. I would also suggest the outdoor patio seating.",

    "text": "Mad props to Rehab Burger!!!      My bff moved to Ohio last summer and when we were texting last night she asked me if I could do a biiiiig favor for her. Being the amazing friend I am, I told her yes of course. What was that favor you might ask? Snag an infamous Rehab Burger pen and mail it to her.  Apparently this is her favorite pen ever and she lost it and she really wanted another one. Okay little mermaid, I can oblige.   I ventured there before work this morning right as the restaurant was opening and told the server (I'm assuming she was a server) my dilemma.  I described the red pen and the server was like, \"Oh yeah! Did it look like this?\" *She flashes me her groovy red pen* \"Yeeeees!!!!\" I exclaim.  She was totally cool and happily gave me a pen I could mail to my bestie despite the fact I wasn't there to stay, eat, and spend money.   My bestie said that the restaurant had a beachy vibe and she really misses it and I need to go eat there.   I vaguely remember eating at a burger joint in Old Town a few years ago taking a picture of a hip skeleton wearing a PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLIOUS tshirt. Same skeleton, different shirt. I had been here before!!!  Thank you to the server and the manager for making my day this morning. I can hardly wait to mail my best friend allllllllllll the cool red Rehab Burger pens. ;)  ~Niki (and Ariel)",

I've cooked great burgers and I've eaten great burgers, but this place takes the cake.  The reason our meal was so great wasn't just the food.  Salyna took us on a damn burger adventure. She helped us to be bold and try the PBJ bacon Sriracha burger and encouraged us to try things that seriously sounded a little silly.  The wings were a mix of 2 sauces and she ordered them extra crispy.  I'm not gonna lie my mouth is straight up starting to water just thinking about them.  The burger was excellent. The wings were incredible. The service was heavenly.  Salyna thanks for making our day. Cheers!",

We ordered the BYOB with bacon, rib-eye, onion rings, and cheddar cheese with the tater-tots, the porkster burger (burger topped with pulled pork, BBQ sauce and cheese) with onion rings, and the philly cheesesteak fries. The burgers can be ordered either with a 5oz patty or a 10oz patty. We opted for the 10oz and they were huge. Definitely will get the 5oz next time. The shaved rib eye was so tender and flavorful and we could not stop eating it. The pulled pork on the burger was so juicy and tender that alone could have been a meal. The fries, onion rings and tater tots were all perfectly cooked and crispy. They have a few different sauce options you can order that come in the side. We tried the pesto aioli, the pineapple teriyaki, and the siracha aioli. The pesto was amazing for the burger and the pineapple sauce added a sweet one sweet combo for the tater tots that tasted great. This is a definite must when in Scottsdale.",

He recommended the PB&J Burger, which sounded like an odd combination: peanut butter and jelly on a piece of meat?   Well, I gave it a try and I have to say that I'm convinced: it's a good combo. Although, I have to say that I'd probably like to eat two smaller burgers: one with this unusual combination and the other one in a more traditional style...it was all a bit too much in the end. So, if you're here with a friend: share this one!  It's a busy place; luckily I was by myself and was seated at the bar right away, but I saw other folks who had to wait for a table for quite some time.",

We decided to get the chicken wings appetizer and our server suggested we mix the medium sauce and Gold Medal sauce, a Southern BBQ mix of vinegar and mustard. Those were delicious and we finished them. For our burger, we ordered and split  the jalapeno popper with the veggie patty. The description sounded promising: guacamole, cream cheese, cheddar, and jalapeno poppers on a pretzel bun. However, all together it was bland. The flavors didn't stand out and there was no kick, the jalapenos weren't spicy and I had to add salt but it didn't help. It needed spice and heat for sure, maybe something sweet to balance too.  Not sure I'd rush back anytime soon, considering how many other dining options there are in Old Town, but the wings were worth it.",

It is...but oh my goodness who knew that something so basic could be the secret sauce! I'm going to just guess that it's creamy Jiff peanut butter. They really load that sucker up to where I'm using it to redip my burger and even try it with my sweet potato tater tots.    The bacon itself was incredibly thick with a slight sweet and smokey flavor.  Although my tastebuds could be confused because of the jam as well. Who cares just know it's good!  This is all wrapped up in a delicious pretzel bun.   The burger wasn't the only thing that was delicious. The sweet potato tots itself was the cherry on top!  Yum!  I do want to note that the a/c didn't work.  It is Phoenix so everyone's A/C breaks down. However I did overhear a customer say \"this place is always hot!\"  I tried ordering something on tap but they said the beer was warm because the refrigerator/cooler where the kegs were was broken. I did end up ordering a Modello instead which was on happy hour.   Would this place be worth it if there was no A/C ever in the hot desert? Still yep!",

We ordered the Backyard BBQ Burger (swapped out the colby jack for cheddar cheese) with sweet poTOToes (so good!), and the Mushroom & Swiss Burger with a side caesar salad.   The BBQ burger was amazing - the flavors were on point, the burger was juicy, and the onion rings added nice texture.  Mushroom & Swiss burger - good cook on the burger, but it lacked flavor. The meat was quite bland and under seasoned, especially since Swiss cheese and mushrooms are both very mild in taste. Not as good as the BBQ burger.   The service is good, portions are very generous, and the prices are reasonable. The menu is extensive and there are SO many burgers, drinks, sides, etc. to choose from. I would definitely come back!",

With surfboards on the wall and TV's with videos of the beach looping on flat-screen TV's, it felt like we had landed in Hawaii and not the middle of the desert! Loved the open-wall style of the restaurant, so you could eat inside but still feel warm breezes.   Hawaiian and Know Poblano Burgers were tasty.  Almond vodka margarita was strong and helped to reinforce the island theme.  :)  Chipotle aioli was fantastic with the fries.  Sweet potato tots tasted like fried bits of sweet potato pie (too rich for me, and I have a sweet tooth).  I'd recommend if you get a smaller burger (\"relapse\" portion) you make sure to get it medium-rare or rare, not medium, if you like your burger juicy.  Service was somewhat slow at the early side of the lunch rush on a Friday (40 min or so to get food).  Our server was attentive and did a good job with recs.",

    "text": "Some of the best gourmet burgers around, made and served by people who care. We've heard of Rehab Burger Therapy for a while now, and finally got a chance to try it out. Wow! The service and the food are absolutely top notch.  We went on a Sunday night and parking was not a big issue - there is a large free lot right next door. Located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, Rehab gives off a relaxing beach vibe with the decor - it's like a cantina in Montego Bay that serves hamburgers unlike any you've had before. Great laid-back ambiance that is enhanced by the friendliness and approachability of the staff. The place is not that big, but the table arrangements are so that you never feel cramped, there is room for everyone to be comfortable. We told the hostess it was our first time, and they just jumped at the opportunity to treat us like VIP's - even the owner, a super cool dude named Wiley stopped by to say hello. You can tell this is a place where management truly cares about every guest that walks through the door. It's not a corporate or franchise atmosphere - it's a local family-style atmosphere, where you feel like they care more about you as the diner, than just getting you to pay the check. This is rare in today's fast-paced high-turnover restaurant industry, and it sets Rehab apart from the others. Our server, who was very attentive and funny, took our orders promptly and got us our beers really fast. We enjoyed the funny stories he told us, especially about some guy who ordered 3 10oz patties and topped that burger off with pulled pork & a fried egg and ate the whole thing! Yikes! While I will never order anything like that, I wasn't quite prepared for the monstrous sized portions you get here. While the prices are in the $10-15 range for the burgers, you definitely get value for your money. We started with some yummy appetizers - chicken wings and \"pig wings\". The chicken wings were the smaller sportsbar variety but they were nice and crispy with a delicious spicy pineapple bbq sauce. I like that the sauce was more of a zesty kick than a burn-your-mouth hot wing. It was perfectly balanced. The pig wings are basically bone-in pork knuckles and are out of this world! The meat was incredibly tender and tasty. We also got a side of the pineapple teriyaki aioli, which was fantastic. I would definitely order those again without thinking twice.  My girlfriend ordered the Chili burger - it was cooked medium as she asked, and she loved it. While I'm not a chiliburger guy, I tried a spoonful of the just the chili and it was quite good, perfectly seasoned. I ordered the Mac Gnarly burger, medium well and it arrived cooked-to-order (this is important as so many places either under or over cook their patties), and omg this thing was a MONSTER. It was two 5 oz patties, with a bun in the middle too, smothered in aged cheddar & 1000 island dressing. Seriously the largest burger I have ever seen in my life - it was a masterpiece. You'd think this was a fork n knife meal, but being the experienced burger eater that I am, I was able to eat most of it with my two hands. I cannot overemphasize how hugely massive and tasty this burger was. Definitely one of the best I've had. Wow factor x1000.  The dessert menu has 1 item, and after tasting the pot brownie, they don't need anything else. This was a supremely decadent and carefully prepared delicacy. As stuffed as I was after the Mac Gnarly, this brownie was just too darn good to let my girlfriend eat alone! Needless to say, we went home absolutely satisfied with our meal.  I highly recommend Rehab Burger Therapy - the quality of the food, the value for the money paid, the quality of service, and the fun relaxing ambiance make this one of the best burger joints in the Southwest. No surprise they keep racking up the awards! When you go...arrive hungry!",

Service was good, bar tender was very kind and polite. It was a good fix. Gives off a Hawaiian/Californian vibe with the reggae music and interior decor. Appealing to the board enthusiast. Gives off the indication that the owner like skateboarding, snowboarding and surfing. Carry a few $20s in yer' pocket because a Heiniken in a bottle will cost you almost $6. Them Cali/Hawaii prices. Maybe when I come back on my next visit my review will be a bit more enthusiastic.",

We arrived with a toddler who was really hungry and the owner bent over backwards to accommodate his needs despite having a packed house on a Thursday night.  I had the PBJ burger and my wife had poblano and both were excellent. At first I thought PBJ would be a little gimmicky, and though I'm always seeking out highly-regarded burgers wherever I go, I felt this was something genuinely innovative and well executed.  Visiting from Austin, this place reminded me of a many of our local favorites: Hut's Hamburgers (menu), Hula Hut (tiki bar atmosphere) and Freebirds (decor/quirkiness) with an extensive bar on top of that.   I returned to get something to go on a Sunday at 3p and every seat at the bar was full along with half the tables so it's no secret that this place rocks.",

    "text": "Waking up with a hangover from the night drinking before, my friend and I scoured Yelp to try and find some food that would catch our eye.  Upon seeing a highly rated burger joint with 'Rehab' in the name, we knew it was meant to be so off we went.    I wasn't sure what to expect but on first glance it seemed like a restaurant I'd find on the beach, with colorful decor and reggae playing throughout.  Our waitress (and hostess) immediately greeted us with a smile and asked where we wanted to sit, and being how perfect it was outside, we chose the patio.    The first thing that caught my eye was cheap beer for happy hour.  $2 domestic and $3 imports had me rethinking my hangover from the night before but I stuck with a soda instead.  Next thing was to peruse the menu.  Based off recommendations on here, I knew I HAD to try the Sweet PoTOToes with whatever I got (I love me some sweet potato fries whenever possible) so that was one less thing to worry about.  I ended up going with the Porkster burger (BBQ pork on top of a 5oz burger) and it was EXACTLY what I needed.  I ordered Chipotle Aioli with the poTOToes and, as always, that is a killer combination.  The meal was the perfect cure and it helped that the service was top-notch.  The waitress had a smile, joked and seemed to know the right things to say and was speedy as can be.  I can't wait to go back and give it a go again, as they have won a customer for life!",

She did not notice until I did and was so hungry that she decided to eat it and  only bring it to the server's attention versus complain.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich and it came piled high on \"Beach\" toast with layers of avocado, tomato, havarti cheese and sprouts...it was a delicious monster of flavors and came with sweet tater tots (you also have the choice of french fries) which were to die for. Shame on me,  I also ordered a chocolate lava shake which was delicious and not too sweet. The shake was served in a tall glass topped with whipped cream and M&M's.  The restaurant itself is not pretentious at all and rather casual in atmosphere sporting surfboards against the wall and cycles hanging from the ceiling.  Overall, it was a nice experience, a good discovery and a nice change from the other burger joints. I enjoyed the fact that RBT is more of a sit down place versus standing in line to have to order your food. It's also nice that the burgers and sandwiches come with a choice of fries versus having to pay extra for them. The restaurant also has a full bar and a heated patio.",

The owners are always around and will stop by to chat, they really want the experience to be a good one for their customers.  The sweet potato tots are awesome, especially with the special dipping sauce that has some heat to it.  I always get the smaller sized burger, and with all the toppings and the tots, it is more than enough food.  My favorite one is the Hatch Chile Cheeseburger, just enough heat and they always cook them perfect (I like mine medium rare and I am always getting them overcooked!)  The Turkey Burger is also a solid choice with avocado and pepper jack.  And, unlike many of the other burger places, they have other stuff on their menu too, pastas, sandwiches, and salads.  If I need a burger fix in the Old Town area, Rehab is my top choice.",

The burger was delicious. The problem came with the service. I watched the gal take my check and money and run back to the cash register. Then I watch her chop it up with staff and just kid of stand around. So I had to go and get her to get my change. She goes, oh yeah your change. I was thinking, how can you forget that. Then she asked her coworker to give her some change  for my bill and hands me 8 bucks no receipt. I then ask for a receipt. As I was walking out, I looked at the receipt and it showed total charge, $9.45. I gave her a twenty and got 8 bucks back! I go back and say how did you short change me so much? So, then she hands me ten dollars...and I look at her like, where's the other 45 cents? She and her coworker told me that they don't keep or give our CHANGE! I said, well your not keeping it! Then she hands me a whole dollar and I look at her like, Are you serious? I hand her back the dollar and told her to keep it. I then called and complained to management which said, shes been here for a long time and we haven't had any problems with her service. Really?? I'm scared to go back for fear of my food being harmed...#Rehabbing from being pissed right now!",

Having babies with you comes with a lot of accessories...diaper bags, stroller, shopping bags, and the crazy kids! They were unscathed by all of it, and helped us out. The hosts went out of the way for us, and made our whole experience terrific. They were attentive, made small talk, and played with the babies.   The food was good.  The Bloody Mary's need some work.

Waiter seats us, gets our drink order, we receive it, and he vanishes, never to be seen again.  Waitress walks by, spills a plate of food, I get hit with some sauce all over my pants, and waitress vows to come back with something to clean my clothing with.  Evidently she vanished with our waiter because she never returns.  So..after all that smoke, wet clothes, no service, we walk to the cashier, explain what happens, pay our bill, and get nothing even resembling an apology.  So, we vanished too, not coming back, if we see the waiter and waitress out in the other dimension, we will tell them to go back to work.",

The waitress took 20 minutes bringing our drink orders over to the table, and by the time they arrived, the ice was melted, the beers were warm. When someone commented on the wait for the drinks, she made them feel as if it was our fault.  Rude, unprofessional, burgers poorly cooked.  Far too long a wait, and the price too high.  McDonalds would have been a better choice than this poseur of a \"hip\" restaurant.  If you want to pay too much for a burger, have shitty service, and a lackluster kitchen, by all means, waste your money here.",

For the price, you can't really ask for a better burger or portion. Cheaper than Zinburger and also superior.",

Dang, maybe that's just me coming from LA and expecting $9+ for a beer, but regardless, still happy to see that.  I got the Turkey Burger which was delightful and light enough where food coma was no that H(ard) Core.  It came with sprouts on top which was a first for me to have tasted on a burger and it was not poorly regarded.  I am also a big fan of TOTS!!!  I got the sweet potato tots in place of the fries which of course made me happy!  The plate also, much to my delight, came with 3 AWESOME dipping sauces, garlic aioli, chipotle mayo, & spicy ketchup.  Each sauce was just awesome!  I had to spread the sauce on my burger for each bite i took!  Man oh man!  It was definitely a very satisfying lunch.  I would recommend this spot to anyone, happy hour from 11a-6p :)  Cheers!",

Our waiter provided great service, and I really appreciated that he told me to best order my relapse-sized burger cooked medium. I prefer my hamburger not have pink in it but sometimes when I ask for medium-well, the meat is too dry. Medium was perfect. I had the poblano burger with sweet potato tots and it was all delicious.

Burgers were really yummy - I had a bbq burger and my hubby had the special, a jalapeno popper burger. Sweet potato tots were fun and the regular fries had great seasoning. Service was great, super friendly. Nice patio seating area.",

The burgers were great.  I had the poblano burger and my friend had the blue cheese and bacon burger.  Both burgers were excellent. I am knocking it down one star for the wings. People raved about them.  Not me....mine must have come from a hen as they were what I would call skinny wings.  No meat and all bones.  I will definitely come back.  One other issue is that the head is a one staller.  Don't like to wait when duty calls.",

So I'd advise getting there early or expecting a little wait. To recommend, the Spicy Mac 'n Cheese burger is so good and gooey and the Jalapeno Popper burger is a favorite. Good fun place for singles, families, or couples. Always recommend when friends and fam are in town.",

I wish I lived in Scottsdale or could ship it up to Seattle.    Has it been awhile since you had amazing service? Well it has been a long time for me. My streak ended here. This was hands down the best customer service I had ever recieved. We were greeted at the bar with a big smile and recomendations. We were served our drinks promptly and Bar tender was amazing. Our drinks were fantastic! Our Bar tender was very informative with her menu! She was nice and attentive and the same with the patrons around us. Thank you so much!  I had the Know Poblano Burger with a Lettuce wrap. The spicy grilled onions were delicious. I ate the whole burger it was so good. I'm so happy they have the lettuce wrap option. I'm a low carb type of gal and they made it so easy!  Drinks were also happy hour priced! Lucky us! Our lunch was somewhere around $30 for 2 meals and 4 Drinks! We left a hefty tip since we were so pleased!  You can't beat the taste, atmoshephere, service or price. If you want a great burger and a great experience, Come here!",

I got a frozen margarita and oh my goodness it was boozy. As I am writing this, I am still tipsy from that single beverage...wow. For dinner I had the hangover burger on a pretzel roll....it was delish! The burger was perfectly cooked and it had egg, cheese, and bacon on it...how could it be bad? It was super delicious. The sweet tots were just ok, but the BF's fries were really tasty. He also liked his turkey club. The service was prompt and friendly by our nice server Pickle. Anyway, I will most definitely be back and next time I will get a pot brownie :-D",

For sure the Relapse burger was more than enough, can't even imagine the size of the Rehab. Love the option of not only picking a size, but also sub out the burger for turkey or chicken at no extra cost (which I forgot to do). And just a side note, this is a place that butters and toasts the buns, so if you don't want it too greasy ask for a bun right out of the bag. Decor is super fun. Would be a great place to take someone new to AZ. Happy hour every day until 6pm, can't beat that!",

Luckily the hostess followed us because we couldn't find 2 seats together like a fellow customer had thought she'd seen.  She put us in between a couple groups at the long table, one was about to leave anyway.  Service was prompt, food was prepared in a reasonable amount of time and served hot.  Is that too much to ask for?  In Scottsdale, so often it is.  It was refreshing.  The burgers are solid.  I had the chili burger with sweet potato tots.  Love the tots.  They were cooked perfectly.  Burgers were done to order.  I really liked their creative sauces - chipotle(?) aioli, pineapple aioli, spicy ketchup.  We also had the calamari which was great.  The prices are pretty solid too, but the portions make up for it I think.    We also did the Reese's pot brownie with ice cream.  Get a dollar off if you check in on Yelp btw!  Paid for the ice cream addition.  :)  Its a brownie on top of Reese's I think in a bed of marshmallow fluff topped with ice cream if you add it.  Very sweet, probably nice to share with like 2-3 other people to get a good portion without feeling sick.  All in all, its a worthy establishment that justify the pricing with great service and solid food.  Happy hour deals are mostly just drinks at this point.  A buck off appetizers too, but not great for food as far as happy hour goes.  Updating my review to add the backyard bbq burger - its awesome!  Burger with bbq sauce and a fried onion on top.  YUM!",

Relapse (5 oz) was wayyyy more than enough for our two day worth of caloric needs. $2 more to double the size of beef patty sounded really appealing. But your arteries and waistline would thank you.   My husband and I almost made the mistake of not accounting the crazy amount of toppings and sides included in our burgers. The nacho taco burger had enough taco meats to make at least two tacos. My beefbistro had enough rib eye to make another hearty sandwich. Topped with ooey gooey cheese, oozing condiments/sauces - we struggled to even lift our burgers. And who could forget the sweet poTOToes - stuffed to my the brim from the burger alone, I couldn't leave these sinful, bites sized treats alone. \"They are small, I'm sure my stomach has room for one more\".   You honestly can't go wrong with any of the options. Very fun combinations, explosive flavors. Wished we have a Rehab back in LA for us to try more of the burgers!",

And holy crap, (we're from California), the burgers are amazing! I ordered a PB&J burger just so I can be different and not a typical basic person and I'm glad I did! I was scared at first, PB & J in a burger?! But the moment I put that thing in my mouth, I felt like I was reborn/rejuvenated whatever you want to call it!  I now have a reason to come back to this dead city :P. Or is it not dead? Prove me wrong :X",

We were told there would be a 15 minute wait which is fine, but we were confused when groups of 2 came after us and all got sat at the bar immediately. We were never asked if we wanted to sit at the bar instead of waiting. Granted it was a busy day, but it was frustrating seeing empty tables but waiting to be seated because the table wasn't cleaned off yet. When we sat down, it took a while for someone to offer us water or even stop by our table (did I mention it was over 100 degrees outside?).   In terms of the food, I didn't love the wings (with the gold sauce) or the spicy pineapple bbq burger. They were both okay. My favorite food item was the sweet potato tots but I've had similar ones elsewhere. The menu is quite large so maybe we just ordered the wrong items but I don't think it was worth the wait. Overall my experience there was just okay.",

    "text": "Time for another review of my favorite burger joint.  Stopped going here for a bit because of the horrendous management change a few months back.  After the manager refused to take to go orders because they were \"too busy\".  This happened TWICE and I am a regular who spends a lot of money here.  Don't tell me you can't make a to go order for a regular.  Decided to go back because we missed Alicia!  She is amazing and always such a fun time.  If it wasn't for her, we would never have come back.  Glad we did too because Alicia was still there and made us decide to give it another try.  She is always on the ball and the best server.  Unfortunately the weekend and night manager whom I believe is called Cass is still there.  She has NO MANAGEMENT skills whatsoever.  She's been rude to customers and even rude to us.  She acts like she can't be bothered and the way she treats the servers in front of customers is appalling.  I even tried to ask her a question once and she couldn't be bothered.  Instead shouting,  I'll send your server over!  She's rude and unprofessional and has hurt this stellar location.  If only they would get rid of her it would be back to normal.  But for now I'm good because I know Alicia has me covered.  Oh and what's this $2 credit card fee???",

    "text": "I ordered here tonight and I am leaving incredibly dissatisfied and still hungry, oh and with a swollen eye. I ordered a bleu cheese burger wrapped in lettuce WITHOUT bacon, which I made very clear while ordering. Then other servers came by and tried announcing what I had ordered and I tried to raise my hand and say that was mine as I asked \"without bacon right?\" And they said no there's bacon in this, it's on the inside. I let them serve it to my other friend who ordered the same thing. Then I was the last one without food and they brought my plate around to me and took off immediately. I assumed since I had stated twice that I didn't eat bacon, and I didn't see it on my meal, it was fine. Well my first complaint was that there wasn't a lettuce WRAP in front of me -- just a burger with lettuce on and below it. Messiest meal ever.... I got half way through the burger (with my knife since it wasn't easy to eat, I might add) and said, \"hmm I feel like I DO taste bacon... that doesn't make any sense right?\" And then my friend and I both checked our meals and sure enough -- I just consumed bacon for the FIRST TIME IN OVER 10 YEARS.   Not cool.  Then I was trying not to freak out, not knowing how I'd react to it right away, and I asked our server if I could just have another order because I wasn't going to eat mine. I literally ordered a pb&j sandwich like a child. It was good, but they made me pay for both my original meal that was misrepresented to me, AND the second meal of pb&j solely because I was still hungry.  And now I've woken up with puffy swollen eyes and spent money on a place where I left still hungry. By the end of the meal too, we all talked about our meals and I think only one person of the five of us were satisfied. Nobody had a to-go box because none of us wanted what we were eating because it was cold or not what was described to us.  It may be good for some happy hour beers, but I won't be returning to Rehab Burger and my friends seemed to be on the same page as me.",

Well I didn't, but people at our table did...  And I think they were 10 OZ. burgers. You had your choice of 2 sizes; rehab or relapse. We're talking some big burgers here! They said the mac n cheese was very good and the pb&j was very interesting. Both plates left not a crumb, so that tells you something, right? I especially liked the choices of buns & sides and the sauces to accompany them were great.   We started with calamari which I thought was a wimpy thing to do since they serve it everywhere. However, they proved me wrong because it was really good! Breaded strips of calamari steak with a fantastic marinara style chunky sauce. Yum!  I opted for a lighter fare - or so I thought, and ordered a salad. Here's the lowdown on it:  Rodrigo Da Vinci -A spanish masterpiece created with a blend of iceberg and romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, scallions and corn tortilla strips tossed with chipotle ranch. Then topped with spicy grilled chicken sauteed in peppers and onions, more tortilla strips, shredded cotija, cheddar jack cheese, a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of cilantro. it's art for your hunger! it was really tasty. My only complaint was that it was way too overdressed.  I should have thought to say light on the dressing or order it on the side.  Next time...  All in all, a terrific place and the service was great too!",

Burgers are offered in 5oz and 10oz patties. With all the choices some of the favorites include a PB&J burger, Hawaiian burger, and my favorite, the jalapeno popper burger. A pet friendly patio allows your dog to hang out, and who knows, fido just might make new friend.",

    "text": "We came here on Cinco de Mayo for dinner.  The place was packed but they were ready us since we made a reservation.  It was a noisy and loud evening with several sports events on the television screens.    Our group of five ordered several different burgers from their creative menu. My Hatch Burger was very good.  I got the 10oz Rehab not the 5oz Relapse version.  The burger consisted of 2 or 3 large pieces of grilled green chile peppers of the famous New Mexico Hatch variety, melted cheddar cheese and chipotle mayo.  I went with the whole wheat bun option.  Delicious!  The bun held together even with the juicy meat and mayo.  The fries that accompanied the burgers were also good  I tasted the Bacon and Blue which was a little dry.  The bacon and blue cheese are inside the meat.  I wished they had been on top.    I also sampled the Ghost Burger.  It is made with two 5oz patties.  I was sure it would be too hot. The chilies are actually in the cheese and added a great spicy flavor to the meat.  An order of the tater tot like sweet potatoes were a very nice addition.  The are well prepared and tasted much better than I imagined they would.   The place had good quick service even on a crazy evening like Cinco.",

    "text": "I've eaten here enough times now that I am confident in my assessment... this is my favorite place for burgers on Planet Earth. I had to try many other burger joints before making such a bold statement, but the quality and variety of ground meat-between-the-buns is second to none.   I always make a point of going for the Rehab Burger (which features jack cheese, fire-roasted green chiles, bacon, and a fried egg), the Jalapeno Burger (with jack cheese, fried jalapenos, and onion straws), or the ghost pepper burger (with ghost pepper jack cheese, guacamole, and carmelized onions). They're all excellent.  The optional sides of sweet potato tots or \"Jamaican\" roasted whole ear of sweet corn are fantastic. The onion rings are huge and also delicious.  Finally, the availability of a full bar, piped-in reggae music, decor, and vibe make it great place to spend some quality time on a lazy afternoon or evening. I can't wait for my next trip to Scottsdale. In fact, maybe I'll start planning it now.",

That being said, I know Arizona is not known for its food, it is very hard searching for an amazing place to eat out that is also consistent. I found some ok and above average burger places like delux and zin burger, both very good but Rehab Burger holds the crown hands down.   My only complaint ever is the wait times can be that of were ancient asian meditation techniques are required to contain the hunger wrath from the scent emanating from the kitchen, that place gets PACKED.   My absolute favorite is the McKnarley Burger with a side of onion rings - you must try this!  I can't wait to try the other locations, the location in Tempe now offers Yelp cash back at 5% to that place is locked and loaded in my crosshairs.  Excellent job from the service staff and chefs! 5 times over and not one let down. Keep it up!",

We came at a busy time with a 20 month old who was hungry,  tired,  and cranky from sitting in an airplane and then a car seat for hours.   Even know there was a wait, they seated as quickly and one of the ladies, who later I found out was Denise, one of the owners, brought out a plate with chopped turkey, ham, cheese, and strawberries for our little one to start munching while we decided what to order.  So kind!   I had the poblano burger on a pretzel bun with a side of Jamaican corn and my husband had p_b and see a burger on a brioche bun. He opted for sweet potato tots his side.   The place had several children, but no children's menu. They were so nice to tell us that they could do a variety of different things for the kids and we ended up getting a taco with chicken and cheese for our son. We asked him to please bring it out as soon as possible even if our food wasn't ready yet. They brought it out very quickly and when the bill came, the even said the taco was on the house because they knew how hungry he was and they didn't bring it out fast enough for their liking.   Such a wonderful place, a wonderful atmosphere, kind people, an excellent food! If this place was in my hometown, I would be there every week.",

Unfortunately, the burger that I requested to be cooked \"medium-rare plus\" was more medium-well (see pic) so I didn't enjoy it as much as I probably would have had it been cooked as ordered. Nonetheless, the onion rings were good and the service was cool so giving it 4-stars. Total bill (including $4 tip and almost $7 Stella that I ordered) was $24.24. I would take a 1/2 star away if I could since that's kinda a lot for a meal that I didn't fully enjoy or consume.",

I could only eat half b/c this is a BIG...Definately this is a burger you could share!!  We ordered take outsince my friend had her pup with her but we will try again & next time we plan on eating in on the patio.  I do wish this place had a bigger patio. It's a little pricey but worth every penny. This is the best buger that I've had & you will be very satisfied...Can't wait to go back & try some of the other burgers & some wings baby!!

Out of 7 visit, this is the only time I dealt with impatience, mostly because of how short staffed they were for Friday around 3:30ish. My server forgot a couple of requests I put on my order, and it took a good 15 minutes to get his attention because he was so occupied with every other party in the room. There was one server taking care of the entire floor, literally (besides the bar). It was unfortunate for the server cause he was bustin his balls, and for my tummy because I waited for my extra add on before eating! My only suggestion would be extra staff on Fridays. Cause I know this place gets packed every Friday, better to be prepared with more staff than having one guy run the show!",

The pb & j was recommended by our waiter Ryan and it was unbelievably delicious. Our friend who had the mac and cheese burger said it was the best burger he had ever had. Ryan said we had to come back the next day for the Saturday special.   We came back the next day and 3 people in our party of 7 had the special. It consisted of a 10 oz patty with cheese, bacon, ham, maple syrup, a fired egg and all of the fixing on a bun that was a glazed donut for the top and 1/2 glazed donut for the bottom. They loved it!  For me it was the jalapeno popper burger, it was fantastic. Our waiter, Devin, was a lot of fun, as was Ryan.   The onion rings and sweet potato tots are the best.   With 10 days left in our trip we plan on going back for more of this \"health food\".",

The menu is very large and the options are plentiful for any palette. Secret... they have an amazing soup that is not on the menu. It is a bit spicy and the ingredients are very non-traditional but it is something you will crave after you have tried it once. I won't tell you the ingredients here... you will have to discover it for yourself! Oh yeah... did I mention they have awesome sweet potato tots? Those are great with the soup and pair well with any of their burgers too! Swing on by and try it sometime..

Oh so delicious, the exboyfriend & I both agreed it was one of the best burgers we both had in awhile. I can't recall the name of the ones we ordered, I remember one had peanut butter. Yes. Peanut butter! Don't knock it until u try it! The pb just added another taste level to the already tasty pretzel bread bread & flavorful juicy beef burger. Along with the onion rings ...oh my.  I wish this was in my state near my house so I could get my once a month burger fix. I have yet too find a place that delivers one so scrumptious.",

It's been a long hot day and my girlfriend and I were craving a ice cold beer. My girlfriend had a question about the size of a beer and he insulted her intelligence and told her she's acting like a 19 year old. This obviously upset her right off the bat. He also mentioned that because of our California license being vertical that we cannot order our drink. Major let down. Must be the law, but we double checked and the law passed April 2016 that it IS accepted. The second time he came along we showed him the law article just to kindly ask if we could order now. He came off stand offish and threw his hands up in the air and said \"idk man\" and then we ask for the manager and he threw his hands up again and walked away. No one came. We felt so disrespected as customers and he made us feel like we were being jerks. We looked at each other and walked out equally feeling pissed off and really ruined the excitement. This guy had a buzz cut and arm sleeve tattoos and really needs to be mindful on how his words and actions come across to others. It really gave us a bad taste in our mouths.  Now we're enjoying our dinner down the street and along with a delicious cocktail.",

Their patties were from a pre - packaged store, like Costco ' freezer section...I could do that bland at home. I had the Hatch Chile Turkey Cheeseburger (I don't do pork or beef) and it was good; the toppings and the pretzel bun put the bland formed turkey patty to shame. My sister had the Know Poblano Burger (turkey too), she liked it and LOVED the pretzel bun. O'rings were good and so were the fries; better than most.  I was a bit disappointed because of the use of pre-formed turkey patties because it didn't really appear that they seasoned the patty and they charged extra for the choice of turkey. I understand it's a burger place, I know their speciality is beef...but pre - formed turkey patties...meh!  I will say, the other diners looked like they were enjoying their chow.  Don't know if I will go back, unless they figure the turkey patty thing but I will say...looking at the other diners eating their beef, they looked pretty happy. So...you eat beef...go! Turkey....just don't be shocked about the bland pre-formed patty...BYOSpices!   Tip: Get the Pretzel Bun...it is nice and light...D-licious!",

We were five seconds away from happy hour ending and he let us sneak in our orders so we could knock a few bucks off the bill, score!   To start we shared the chicken chile lime dip, I think it was called. So good and spicy. Their homemade tortilla chips were really great too.   I ordered the hangover burger with the sweet potato tots and my man ordered the porkster burger. Thank goodness we ordered the smaller, five ounce ones, because we hardly finished what we got. I wasn't crazy about the tots, but  I did enjoy the sauces that were brought out with them.   Major props to our server and this place for standing out in this town.",

I was disappointed that they only had two local-ish beers on tap and the one I had (the Four Peaks Eighth Avenue) was not very fresh. Service was decent. I probably won't go back as there are too many other better places to eat in Scottsdale that aren't as aggressive with their decor theming, overly loud music, and multiple television screens blaring from every wall.

Featuring a beef patty and a healthy serving of BBQ pulled pork that is then placed between a pretzel bun and topped with cheese. The pretzel bun is the perfect platform to savor the flavor of meat. Unfortunately, the burger I enjoyed was more of a pork sandwich than a burger, and the BBQ sauce was just a little bit too peppery (making me miss out on the all the flavors of the beef). The beef was very flavorful and the bun was perfectly moist and tender. If the BBQ and pork were toned down just a bit the burger would be in elite territory.",

I was annoyed so in fact I asked another server \"do y'all not want me to pay?\".. Finally a third server took my card over to Lexi who then took my payment   2) they didn't give me any plastic ware or napkins or anything   3) disappointed with the sweet potato tater tots  The veggie burger was delicious! I asked them to give me crispy onions instead of lettuce and tomatoes. Loved it!! It came with some sort of dipping sauce - I think cilantro lime which was super duper Yum as well!

Great service to get cold beers and onion rings out fast. They followed up with constant checks on water refills and to make sure the food was to our liking. We split a Patty Melt....at the suggestion of the bartender/waiter who said it came with 2 large patties of beef ( he wasn't kidding!). Thank goodness....it was all we could eat! Would have loved to try their desserts. Everything reasonably priced and served fresh. Only dig was that bathroom only had one spot and the party prior to me.....took forever. Aside from that, great time!",

    "text": "Caribbean Island themed restaurant tucked away in the middle of Old Scottsdale. The menu had alot of interesting choices for those craving a burger that would easily add a few inches to anyone's waist size. I went with the Bacon and blue Rehab Burger on a pretzel bun. ( 10oz. burger with bacon and blue cheese cooked inside of it) and I had normal fries. I've had better blue cheese burgers than this at other places.. I couldnt put my finger on it but something just tasted a little off with this one. So I was disappointed with that. I should have just got the same thing my wife ordered. She opted with the spicy macaroni and cheese Burger. With sweet potato tots. She gave me the rest of her's and I enjoyed it much better. So I'm not doubting that this place has good burgers, I just made the wrong choice off their menu. But if your looking for good food that will make your gut feel guilty then look no further.",

    "text": "Once again Yelp comes through. Over 1100 reviewers rate this place 4 1/2 star average. They were right on. One of my Yelp friends wrote a review that convinced me to come in for Therapy. My wife and I came here for lunch. First of all let me say parking shouldn't be a problem as there is a parking corral just behind the restaurant. The decor is tropical leaning toward a beach theme. We showed up around noon on a weekday and were seated immediately. Right away I got a coupon when I checked in for $3.99 salsa and chips. Our waiter brought them right out with our drinks.  I got the Ghost Burger. This comes in 2 sizes. The relapse size which is like a quarter pounder, and the rehab sized which is like the half pounder. After reading other reviews I knew I should only order the relapse size. The Ghost Burger rehab size comes with two relapse burgers grilled to order, blanketed in ghost pepper jack cheese and topped with crispy onions and fresh guacamole. The relapse size comes with one burger.  The chips and salsa were amazing. They use flour tortillas and deep fry them making the chips a crispy golden brown. The salsa is made fresh and has a little bite to it. The Ghost Burger is a fire ball of deliciousness. The burger was juicy and grilled to me specification perfectly. For a little added kick I asked for some siracha. I chose to have mine on a Kaiser roll. It's a little larger and held all the toppings well. We were planning to get dessert, but had no room. I will have to return to try some other unique burgers.",

I've heard about this place that mixed peanut butter and jelly, sriracha sauce on a burger made of choice, and no, it wasn't from someone who was pregnant.    I scoffed, but the look on their face showed they were serious about how much they liked it.   I had to try.      We rolled in and gave it a try.    The place has atmosphere, which I liked immediately.    The service was johnny on the spot;   friendly, and fast at the end of a work day.    Our waitress was funny and was spot on.   We liked her immediately.   Then the food came out.    BP&J Bacon Burger:   its ridiculous.    I like to think I know my way around a kitchen, and am a bit creative bit this thing changed my life.   It was epic.   I didn't even know you could do that, but they did.    It was seriously sloppily delicious.   I'll go back, but next time with a knife,  fork and a giant napkin that won't be big enough to to wipe  the smile off my face.   The only star I can knock off, is the chef wasn't quite paying attention to the difference between medium rare and well done.   A couple burgers had to go back, and still weren't right.  Don't ask how you want your burger, if you're not going to cook it that way (or the chef doesn't know what the difference is as it pertains to his brain and when to flip the burger).   You guys almost have it nailed!  Nicely Done Rehab Burger!",

Rehab has that same vibe, although it focuses almost exclusively on burgers and doesn't have the same menu selection that Pischke's had.  However, the burgers are really good, so that makes up for it. If you're really hungry, get the Rehab size burger and if you're not so hungry get a Relapse. However, either way, get a side of sweet potato tater tots to go with them and you'll thank me later.  Service is fast and friendly, seating is ample, and there's rarely a wait to get a table. If the weather is nice, go ahead and sit on the patio. But most of all, just relax, rehab, and have a great time.",

    "text": "If you go home hungry, its your fault.  This place reminds me a little bit of Hodad's, a hugely popular burger joint in the Ocean Beach neighborhood of San Diego that emphasizes a laid back beach style atmosphere with crazy burger concoctions.  Seems like owners Ken Likewise, Denise Nelson, and Wiley Arnett had something like that in mind when they opened this place in 2012.  And being that all three owners are former Oregano's execs, the food portions at Rehab are (like Oregano's) somewhat ludicrous.  Seeing that so many fellow Yelpers have been here with such positive results, a lunchtime stopover seemed long overdue.  Located in Old Town Scottsdale on 2nd Street just east of Scottsdale Road, Rehab is hard to miss.  The beach style decor, outdoor patio, chill background music, and stacked bar all beckon you in (you could be forgiven for at least initially thinking you were walking into a tourist trap).  I came at opening expecting the Saturday lunch crowd would quickly swell (which it did), and grabbed a spot at the bar inside.  There's seating for probably 75 inside and another 25 out on the patio out front altogether.  Plenty of TVs here if you want to come and watch a big game.  Otherwise you can just admire the surfboards, beach cruisers, and other beach themed decor on the walls and ceiling.  As other Yelpers have noted, Happy Hour extends from opening all the way to 6pm so plenty of opportunities for cheap eats and drinks earlier in the day.  They also have a $4 chips and salsa Yelp check-in deal (just over $1 cheaper than their normal price), but I wasn't here for chips and salsa.  I did grab a $1.75 can of PBR, well, just because.  But the burgers were the real driving force here.  Take your time deciding though as there's at least two dozen burger options by my count.  And that doesn't even count the different burger sizes, buns, and sides options.  One burger that immediately leaped off the menu for me was the Porkster.  I like pulled pork, I like BBQ sauce, I like beef, and I like cheddar cheese.  And yes I would very much like to try all four at once in between a bun, thank you very much.  I chose the house brioche for my bun as I love brioche.  My side of choice was the sweet potato tater tots.  Total cost for the beer, the food, tax and tip came to $20.  I should note that I ordered the Relapse size burger, which is the smallest size they offer. The Rehab size is twice the size of the Relapse for only $2 more, but after seeing my meal, I'm sure glad I stuck with the regular.  This thing was huge.  Overloaded with pulled pork and copious amounts of cheddar cheese.  The bartender alertly gave me a big stack of napkins with my meal knowing this would be messy.  I had to chip away at some of the loose pulled pork (which was solid by the way), before I could attempt to grab the buns with two hands.  That first big bite was awesome.  Great mix of beef flavors and the bun was perfect.  I also liked the tater tots (including the sauce it came with, which I believe was a chipotle ranch).  I had absolutely no room for dessert this go around as I was totally stuffed.  So I'll reiterate what other Yelpers have said and confirm that yes, the hype is well deserved.  The portions are huge, the staff is friendly, the atmosphere is super chill, and the menu is as inventive as it is expansive.  If this is what Oregano's looks like in burger form, chances are the owners of Rehab will be here for a long time (and likely opening more locations in the near future).  Time for me to go to rehab, for a food coma.",

Hubby had the PBJ burger and couldn't believe how great the combo was. I had the spicy mac burger and it was also amazing... and I don't usually care for Jalepeno!   Definitely a stop for anyone who likes good burgers!!",

The service here has never been shitty but it's possibly because I choose to eat at this pretty popular and tiny restaurant at non-peak hours or take my food to go.   My personal favorite, the peanut butter jelly bacon sriracha burger, sounds gross but i've recommended it to people before and the daring few who have tried it, enjoyed it. Their spicy mac n cheese is pretty good, not the best but definitely worth the price and if you like a kick of heat with your cheese. I've tried several of their burgers and none have been a disappointment, so I feel this place is worth trying especially if you enjoy trying weird burger combinations or just want a tasty gourmet burger in general.  They also have a good happy hour.",

They should come with a warning sign that you're going to need about 40 napkins and maybe a fork, because some of these burgers are really stacked. Mac and cheese burger was exactly as awesome as it sounds. If you've never had a PB&J burger, this is the place to try it. Sounds weird but was really good. Fries and sweet potato tots are both amazing. Went back multiple nights in a row just to try different burgers.  Decor is really fun, too. It's small so it gets crowded fast. I tried to go early, around 4PM for dinner thinking it would be emptier but it was just as packed.   Staff was super friendly and attentive. The only thing I didn't understand were the way they set up the drink specials because it was like a \"pick your own\" alcohol plus soda but it never really worked for me. I'd stick to the regular drink menu.",

All three burgers were cooked above ordered level.  All three burgers were so dry, you thought  you were eating saw dust.  Also the flavor of the meat was nothing special.  Seriously people, you must be kidding if you think this is a good burger.  I bet if you try just the burger, without all the toppings, you will realize the burger is not so good.  Maybe this is why they offer so many burgers with toppings.  Oh, after our burgers came, and asking twice, our napkins and silverware came.  My son liked the hot dog.  My daughter thought the chicken was overcooked and dry (I could see burnt pieces).  The onion rings were excellent.  The sweet potato tots were really good.  This is why I gave it 2 stars, otherwise, I would have given this place a 1 star.    We planned on ordering dessert.  The waitress came by, in passing, and dropped off our check while our main plates were still on the table.  We thus assumed she did not want us to order dessert, and we left.",

My hotel is close by and it was walking distance, but for some reason I didn't know where anything was because it was so dark out in Old Town. I'm from Houston, and we like a lot of light.  Anyway I walked in and loved the decor.. It kinda gave me that fun playhouse surfer type beachy feel. (sometimes when I explain stuff it sounds weird, but you'll get it when you see it)  I sat at the bar and read the menu, I decided to order the Bacon Bleu on a Pretzel bun togo.  It took like maybe 10 minutes.   When I got back to my hotel. the burger was okay... It was my fault for not asking for lettuce and tomato, but the burger was okay... Not the best but not the worst either. I'll go back again to try a different burger, and give you guys feedback on it!!  I also wish hey had given me napkins for my togo order though.. :-(  Sidebar: there was this girl that worked there, she sounded like and kinda looked a little like Lindsay Lohan... (I'm random I know).",

She wasn't rude or anything, but she wasn't particularly helpful.  The decor and ambiance of the place are really dingy. You'd expect from such a popular place that they could put a bit more effort into presentation. It wasn't like the food was cheap, either. I think I've been in nicer McDonald's, actually. The whole restaurant was uncomfortably hot, everyone smelled like they'd been in the sun all day, and it was as loud as a bar you go to find a one-night-stand. But it was 1pm on a Sunday, so that was really bizarre. Would it kill them to turn up the A/C? It is Arizona, after all.  I wanted to order one of their spicier menu choices, but I could barely stomach any food at all because of how stuffy the place was. I stuck with a fairly bland cheddar burger with thousand island dressing. I did not have any complaints about the burger, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  My brother ordered a frozen strawberry margarita to cool off. I'm glad I held off ordering one myself until I tasted it, because it tasted like that cheap corn syrup mixes you get on the bottom shelf in the liquor aisles at Walmart. I can make better at home, thanks.  I really expect better from Scottsdale than this, especially when this place has so much hype. Maybe it was an off day, or maybe not. There's dozens of awesome places in town to get a burger, and this one -- despite all the raves -- doesn't make my list.",

First of all definitely not what I expected, to be honest I was expecting more of a \"Five Guys\" setup but to much pleasure it was a more intimate, personal and relaxed environment.. The surfboard outside kind of hints at the environment inside.  But wait I was in basketball shorts cross trainers and a tank top normally I wouldn't wear this to a sit down restaurant just personal preference but the very nice lady informed me they do take out as well. Perfect. I paid after settling with \"The Hangover Burger\" which sounded amazing. It was about $14 not the cheapest but I'm from CT and that's what I would expect to pay for a good burger.   I waited outside in my car since she said it would be 15 minutes, called a friend and in 12 minutes she came out with my food without me asking. That was very sweet of her to do so. I drove back to the hotel go to my room then remember I didn't ask for any utensils or condiments! To my surprise though it was all there paper plate, utensils, napkins and even an assortment of condiments. Wow, I was pretty impressed with the customer service and I haven't even tried the burger yet.   Since I know this review is getting lengthy let me just say the above and beyond customer service was not let down by the phenomenal food. Cooked a perfect medium as requested with some sweet potato tots I have never tried that were simply put, addicting.    I will definitely be recommending this place to friends and those who love to get lost in different cities and try great food. Bravo Rehab Burger bravo.",

The meat lacked seasoning, bacon was a little under cooked and I thought that the chilies should have been diced.  The fries were cooked and seasoned well but the two dipping sauces where store bought, kinda lame in my opinion.  I will not be going back to Rehab!   Food Guy Out!",

When it came out I cut it into 4 pieces just to make sure I wouldn't make a mess (this is one messy burger) It was cooked perfectly medium rare, which is apparently harder to do than it sounds. Words can not describe how good this burger was, its a must try. The fries were pretty good as well.   If your looking for a good burger and your in the area, stop by, you will not be disappointed.",

Burgers were great, I had the hatch green chili burger and it was phenom. Service was quick and to the point. .  Missed: Wasn't as big a fan of hubby's PB&J burger, but it was definitely a fun experience to try. They were out of the famed tater tot so we had to miss out. Also, worth noting that it definitely feels more like a bar than a restaurant - \"not that there's anything wrong with that...\" but make sure you get in the mindset.   All said, a good experience and fun to try something different. .",

Twenty to thirty minute wait on a Tuesday evening even though it looked like there were some empty tables left?  Check.  Would we be disappointed??  NO!  It was FANTASTIC!  Our waitress was very attentive and the food was all great.   The onion rings were some of the best we have had and the burgers were cooked perfectly.  I had the chili cheeseburger and my husband had the bacon cheeseburger.  The sweet potato tots are delicious, as are all of the various dipping sauces they offer.    Caution:  the burgers come in two sizes.  Do not overestimate the size of your appetite.  We both brought a good chunk of our meals home, too stuffed to continue.",

I got the sweet tots for an appetizer, which were really good.  You could also get it as a side for a burger.  I ended up with a turkey burger, which was okay.  I got a side of onion rings with it as well.   The rings were only alright.  The rest of my group had burgers, which they said tasted pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary for the cost of the burger.  My group didn't like the beer selection, I'm a fan of the four peaks beer, so I wasn't complaining about that.  All in all, it was a pretty average experience.",

Also, best bloody mary I have ever had in my life, and let me tell you I have had my share of bloody marys. I even get virgin ones because they are just THAT good. The sweet potato tots are out of this world, I'm getting hungry just thinking about them. All food aside, the service is amazing! The servers are so nice and friendly and accommodating, I was absolutely stunned. One day I came in extremelyyyyy hungover, so obviously hungry and the waitress took one look at me and knew I was dying. She literally whispered and purposely sat me at the furtherest table away from the bar so I wouldn't have to see any alcohol. LIKE REALLY? Talk about going above and beyond. Not to mention that we got our food in like 10 minutes! Sooo basically: amazing food, amazing service, and amazing price. My favorite place to eat in Scottsdale!",

Fries are usually pretty hard to beat but the corn was a stunning surprise.   Wow.  And the burger?  Couldn't put it down.  Definitely a new favorite to add to the rotation.",

You can't make a burger like they do over at Rehab, unless you decide to put on your burger whatever you can find in the fridge.  That's pretty much how their Sunday specials work, but you won't make a Sunday special as good as theirs.  And always get your burgers with the pretzel buns.",

I always get the Bacon cheeseburger, mainly because I am to scared to try new things....but....the other day my friend tried the PB&J burger...I know, that's what I was thinking too, how gross peanut butter and jelly on a hamburger, disgusting.  OMGawd!!!!!  IT WAS AHHHHHH-MAZING!!!!  It was so good! The sweet potato taster tots are awesome too.  Feels like it's always super busy when I go there, but I guess that speaks to how good it is.  The wait staff is not the best, every time I go no matter what day or time of day, the wait staff is pretty slow and sometimes forgetful.  If you can overlook the so so waitstaff (they are always friendly) and go solely for the food...you will NOT be disappointed !!",

We had a variety of burgers and sandwiches and everyone enjoyed their meals. Service was fine. Sat outside and it was a perfect night for it. Glad we were outside as inside gets really loud. Only complaints -  the appetizers came out with the meals, and our burgers were inconsistently done. Three of us ordered medium, and they were all three different - from well done to rare. Guess I expect more from a place that specializes in burgers... It won't keep me from going back though!",

The chocolate shake tastes like it was made from Hershey's chocolate syrup and low quality shake base (disgusting). I prefer sweet potato fries over sweet potato tots. The tots taste like regular potatoes to me. We got the BBQ pork wings and some of it was good, some were dry. It was also way to barbecue-ee for my taste. The place was way too loud.",

We stopped by today right when they opened and snagged a great table on the patio with our pooch...the host recommended a super dog friendly table and brought out some water for her.  Our server was great - friendly, efficient and so nice to our dog.  The food was fantastic too...we tried the chili cheese fries to start (don't judge...we went to the gym that morning) and each of us had the hawaiian turkey burger - one on a pretzel bun and one on a wheat bun with sides of fries.  The portions were really large (I took half of my burger home) and everything was made fresh.  This is a great spot to enjoy the nice weather on the patio with some good food and drinks or inside to catch the games.  Definitely worth a visit!",

Unfortunately after sharing an appetizer and burger, we were too full for dessert. I also feel like since we didn't want the extra food to go to waste that we over stuffed ourselves and couldn't really enjoy the meal as a result. Some day soon I would like to go back there and get a smaller meal so I can fully enjoy it. Over all the quality of food was great and I LOVED the \"dive bar\" atmosphere!!",
