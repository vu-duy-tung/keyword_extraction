    "text": "This little place was different from your usual albertos, jilabertos or any of the other bertos out there.  First off the menu was smaller than most of those types of places.  They have a small seating area outside, another small seating area in front of the counter where you order.  And a third in the back. We ordered a green chili crisp, which was like an open quesadilla and man that chili was hot.  Great flavor, but hot.  I had the red chili fry bread taco.  The red chili had great flavor and was not as hot as the green.  The Taco had cheese with a little lettuce and tomato on the side.  My wife had the open fry bread taco with shredded beef.  The beef had perfect seasoning, and the taco had beans with lettuce tomato and cheese.  After seeing hers I would have ordered open also as even though mine was closed tt was so sloppy I had to eat it with a fork anyways.  As I had not been here before I ordered a side of rice and beans.  The beans were quite tasty,though the rice was a little bland.   The chips that came with the food were different than ordinary chips, they were a little puffy with a nice crisp.  There were three salsas that varied in flavor but all were good.   They place is called Maria's Mexican food and fry bread for a good reason, get the fry bread you won't be disappointed",

No complaints here on \"too much toppings\" as one reviewer mentioned. Simple fix for that? You scoop it off with a tortilla chip and enjoy! We also tried their menudo which was better than what I had anticipated. To quench our thirst, we had some horchata which I can tell was homemade and not out of some premixed drink dispenser. We ordered plain Indian fry bread with honey and powdered sugar as dessert. It was oh so satisfying. The young man at the window was very nice to us (we told him we'd never been there before) and he let us sample some red and green chile. The green chile was very tasty and what we chose to have with our fry bread. Great customer courtesy and service, food was delicious, and they're quick (we went through the drive-thru). I recommend you give it a whirl if you're in the area.",

All of these five-star reviews are celebrating this establishment's ability to take a store-bought tortilla, stuff it with something that comes out of a can, sprinkling cheddar cheese on top (CHEDDAR on Mexican food???), and plopping that mess in front of a customer.  The bottom line for me is that the food here is below average. If you want to sample some really amazing, authentic Mexican food then go check out La Santissima in Phoenix or Glendale. Now THAT is real food, not the cheddar-cloaked garbage like this place serves. Maria: Stick with frybread, you suck at Mexican. Even Macayo's tastes better.",

They are generous with the toppings, so much so that we ate half of ours and are taking home the rest. We also ordered a plain one to have for dessert later, definitely looking forward to that. They also brought out fresh chips, still warm, really delicious. Can't wait to eat here again!  The service is super friendly. My wife went here last week for her bday lunch and they surprised her with a dessert fry bread when they overheard about her birthday. They were so great today too when we just stopped for lunch. Really just excellent service, and so fast! I ordered, went to the bathroom, and the food came out as I sat down. Less than five minutes, tops.   There's a small room in back that looks like it's for parties or groups, fountain drinks and bottled drinks from a fridge, and tables on the patio if you want to eat outside. The bathroom was clean and well kept. It's a fairly small place but obviously well taken care of. It's really inexpensive, which makes my very frugal wife incredibly happy. Yet another reason we have been here twice in the past month, and will likely be back quite soon",

Was it clean? I believe the inspection team at Phoenix Children's hospital would authorize it for an appendectomy. What about the food? You won't be dissatisfied with either the Chorizo and egg burrito or Frybread taco. Both were cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. The table salsa mixed a savory side with the mini tortilla chips. The service was prompt and professional and nothing short of a friendly reminder of how we should treat each other in a fast casual setting. I'm not naming names....but you know who you are!!

Had a wonderful lunch at Maria's and the service was excellent. They checked on me throughout my eating experience to see how everything was. I ordered the sopapilla since it was vegetarian. The owner also provided complimentary guacamole (yum!). The fry bread was thicker and slightly soggy due to the toppings, but it was very filling. It was a pleasant surprise when the owner provided a complimentary fry bread (the dessert version). Added my own amount of powdered sugar and honey. YUMM.. loved the crispiness of the bread.  I was told that there will be more vegetarian items on the menu.   If I'm in the area, I would come back again.",

    "text": "Maria's Frybread & Mexican Food is a family affair. You'll see Maria in the kitchen and her son Alfredo at the counter. They are so nice that you might be inclined to award five stars just based on likeability but there's no need. Maria's prior 26 years in the kitchen are on full display. Open only eleven weeks, this tiny restaurant is well on its way to becoming a huge success story.   I haven't had a chance to sample the full menu as of yet, but I intend to over the next few months. A simple chicken taco? Served with white chicken breast meat. Sold! Some of their most popular items are the Frybread Tacos and, of course, the Sopapillas. No bulk processed microwaved refried beans to be found here. They're made fresh on the premises, as is all the food.  The dining room is very small, but there is a small overflow dining room in the back of the restaurant. There are also some orange picnic tables out front, remnants of the Two Hippies business that formerly occupied the space. Maria's doesn't mind your pooch joining you at these tables, but the landlord apparently does, having posted a \"no pets allowed\" sign back in the Two Hippies era. Dog friendly? Perhaps. You tell me. There is also a drive thru. You'll be rewarded for stepping inside, however, with fresh homemade chips and red and green salsa. There is no kids menu per se, but they will make scaled down versions of some items upon request. Just ask.  importantly, they are listening to their customers and still actively making improvements. They're planning on adding some more vegetarian options and perhaps gluten free items, no easy feat in Mexican cuisine. They're also thinking about extending their hours. And the candy under the counter? Added for nearby high school students who drop in. I suspect they're going to need a bigger dining room!  What impressed me most is when Alfredo approached me on my first visit. \"I don't think I've seen you before...\" A ten minute discussion about his mom and the restaurant ensued. A few days later, when I visited again, he called me by name. Did I say impressive? I can easily see why Maria's has a five star average on Yelp.",

I basically did not read any negative reviews on Yelp before deciding to try this place.  The owner told us they only opened about 10 weeks ago.  First of all, it is tucked away so please make sure if you are using google maps, look for the bright yellow van with Maria's Frybread written on it and it is in that shopping plaza.  When we walked in, my friend and I obviously looked confused so the guy working there asked if we needed help and gave us recommendations.  My friend is a vegetarian so she had the sopapilla with just no meat but I had the sopapilla with the green chili.  It was delicious!!!  We ordered at the counter and had our food delivered within minutes.  They also said the tamales are great as well so I definitely want to come back and try it!  The green chili had a little spice to it.  They also give you a green salsa on the side as well as a red one.  I liked both but I liked the red one a little bit better.  My friend thought the red one was spicier.  I wish I lived closer because I would definitely come here a few more times.  I also felt that it felt very family run and the service was great.  They noticed that my friend had stepped out for a while for a phone call so they offered to wrap up her meal so it didn't get too cold.",

Their red chile is the star, as the green chile sauce has more beans and meat than chile. The sopapillas were incredibly fresh, and the service was  phenomenal. We asked for a lot of extras and sides, and they were accommodating at every turn. We will definitely be back, but if you are looking for a place that mimics Sadie's this isn't quite that.",

High praise indeed.",

Located on the corner of a two-story commercial building, this little place is the real deal.  The fry bread is great and a nice alternative to flour and corn tortillas, but it's the sauces that keep me wanting more.  The red sauce is made from pickled jalapenos and garlic and has an incredible pepper flavor without just beating you over the head with heat.   I only get down to Phoenix once a year, but this is definitely a place that I plan to go back to next year.",

    "text": "Worth Every Calorie  If you're searching for a fancy restraunt to dine then Maria's isn't for you.  However,  if what you're looking for is hot, crispy, and delicious Frybread, then look no further, Maria's Frybread and Mexican Food is calling your name.   Maria's Frybread and Mexican Food is a real gem. The decor is not fancy by any means however, the restraunt is comfortable, clean, and the staff is accomadating. The menu at Maria's has something to satisfy everyones taste, from the sweet to the savory. I wasn't sure what I should order on my first visit to Maria's. However, the owner took the time to explain the menu, gave samples and helped me decide what kind of frybread to order.   On this visit I opted for savory rather than sweet and settled on the red chili beef Taco, made with refried beans, red chili beef, onions, shredded cheese, and lettuce. My lunch companion went with the green chili.   As we were waitng for our fry bread we were given a complimentary basket of hot tortilla chips and salsa.  The tortilla chips at Maria's were absolutely delicious and were everything a torilla chip should be, fresh, hot, crispy, and lightly salted. I could have ate the entire basket myself.  After our chips it was time for our frybread. Although, the fry bread is made to order, our frybread was served quickly.  The frybread portions at Maria's are big (larger than the plate) and are delicious. The frybread was light, airy, served hot, and so flavorful and the red chili meat was lean and delicious.  I can't recall a time when I had better tasting frybread.   Just when I thought my meal couldn't get any better the owner came out with a hot basket of complementary sopaipillas with honey, cinnamon, and powdered sugar, and the sopaipillas were fantastic. I couldnt beleive how much delicious food we devoured at Maria's but it was worth every calorie.  If you ever find yourself with a hankering for frybead, at a restaurant with great customer service and wallet friendly prices give Maria's a try, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Maria's had good ratings and my girlfriend loves fry bread so we gave it a shot.  I had two green corn tamales and a shredded beef taco. My girlfriend had two beef enchiladas and a plain fry bread with honey and cinnamon & sugar. The tamales were really good but what blew me away were the salsas. The tomatillo salsa had a really good flavor and like most just a little kick. The hot salsa was just hot enough to remind me I was eating fresh made authentic salsa without over powering the senses. It has a lot of flavor which goes out the door with a lot of hotter salsas. The other red salsa was amazing. I couldn't get enough of it, think it had about half the bottle. The gentleman working told me it was picked jalapenos and tomato.  The fry bread was done very well. It was fried perfectly, had a nice tanned color and was not greasy at all. After our meal it was big enough that we could both split it.",

The food was delicious and the owners were amazing - they were just as concerned with my 10 month old sons happiness as they were mine!  I watched return customer after return customer place their order and the owner remembered not only what they ordered but how they ordered it. If that doesn't get you all warm and fuzzy, I don't know what will! OMG! I almost forgot to mention the tomatillo salsa!  If it would be socially acceptable to bathe in, then count me in! Only somewhat joking!   But seriously, the place was very quaint, the food was delicious, the service was fast and the ambiance was relaxing.  If you are in a rush, don't forget there is a drive-thru! They are a bit of a hidden gem, so as another reviewer mentioned, look for the yellow van in the front of the parking lot and it is located behind the Pet Club.  Enjoy!",

I can't wait to go back! Next time I'm getting my own fry bread.   Also worth noting, the guys behind the counter were incredibly nice. They helped explain the menu choices, made recommendations when asked and checked on us 2 or 3 times while we ate. It is fast-food type restaurant, but served with real plates/silverware and attentive service, even though the place was full.   Try it out. You will be glad!",

    "text": "Great new restaurant in a tough to spot location. Look for a bright yellow painted van in the front of the parking lot.   Live nearby and have stopped twice now. The menu is shorter than most people expect from a Mexican-type spot, but to me that's a the sign of a good restaurateur: do what you know, only what you know, and do it right. Maria's does that. Food both times was absolutely delish.   On top of good food, this really is a family owned AND operated business by people who couldn't be nicer or more accommodating.   So do yourself a favor and find the yellow van.   Update: I have made this one of my go-to spots - a couple of stops per week for breakfast burritos and one a week or every other week for lunch / dinner -  and tried a number of items. Everything has been absolutely delish. Green chile fry bread is off the charts. Breakfast burritos are huge and very good.   Give them a try. They're in kinda a tough location (hard to see fm the road), but this is absolutely one of those family joints worth supporting and keeping in the neighborhood.",

The menu consists of Mexican food such as tacos, tamales, and burritos as well as the famed frybread. I had a vegetarian frybread with beans, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, onions with a side of guacamole and a horchata.   The frybread was perfect. It was just the right amount of light crispness, not too doughy, with a slight amount of chew. The toppings in the frybread were fresh and went well together. The side of guacamole was a good portion to go with my meal.   The meal came with a selection of salsa/hot sauce and chips. The chips were thick and crispy. I loved the 3 different bottles of hot sauce/salsa (Red, green, chipotle). They aren't afraid to pack a spicy punch! I made my frybread XMas style putting both green and red sauce on it for maximum deliciousness!  The horchata was freshly made, light and sweet. It had too much of a powdery taste for me though.  Service was fast and friendly. The total for my meal was a little less than $12.  I'd love to come back here again for more of that delectable frybread!   4.5/5",

Now, I am a fan!  Service was excellent and the food was, too. Total dive. I got the carne asada and ground beef taco just to try. Both were good. My friends each got a red chile frybread. They gave me some and it was so good I almost didn't give them their food back! They give a lot of food, too. And leftovers are just as tasty. Everything re-heats well.  I washed everything down with something from heaven that I never had before: an hibiscus juice. The waitress said that it cleanses the body. It is almost up there with getting baptized!",

    "text": "Okayyyyyy, now I know why this lovely place has such great reviews on Yelp! The second we walked in, we were greeted with big smiles and had the entire menu explained to us since we were first-timers! We even got to sample the red and green chili beef so that we could decide which one we wanted on our frybread! My husband and I both chose the red chili - it was SO delicious! The frybread was packed with beans, red chili beef, cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce. They serve fresh chips and homemade salsas {mild, medium, and hot} on the side as well. I highly recommend dining in because their service is so friendly and sure to brighten your day! It was like they read our minds with water refills, and everything. I'm so excited this amazing place is in the neighborhood, we'll be back!!",

It is located on the Southeast corner of Thomas and 40th street behind Pet Club. It is a very small restaurant, I think there were only 5 small tables inside. When ordering, I was standing directly next to someone who was enjoying their meal!  Now, to the good. We order a bean & cheese fry bread, red chili & cheese fry bread, a powdered sugar & honey fry bread, chips & salsa, and a massive pickle (random, I know). All of this was to go.  The portion size was huge and the toppings were overflowing. To our disappointment though, they did not include powdered sugar or honey... only a plain fry bread. Now this wasn't a huge deal since we had both ingredients, but if I were visiting from out of town, it would have been a heart breaking moment!   Overall, we will be back. They don't only serve fry bread, they have a nice list of other Mexican entrees.   Oh and before I forget, if you like pickles, try one! They are huge and delicious for only $1!     Happy eating!",

To be fair, the fry bread per se was good, but the meat lacked any sort of seasoning, which was strange. . . Overall very low quality food, reminiscent of taco bell.",

I ordered the green chili taco , my husband the carne open faced taco . Absolutely mouth-watering. The best meal we had in Phoenix . The service was super friendly and helpful . When we ordered a sweet fry bread with our meal , they continued to see where we were in our meal before bringing the sweet bread so that it would be hot . My only sadness is we live in Georgia and so far from this wonderful place and amazing food . Well done Maria's !!!!",

My wife got a cheese enchilada, which she liked,  but said the red sauce was a little bland, and I got the  carne asada frybread taco, and the carne asada tasted like something in between corned beef hash and the smell of dog food. I ended up throwing 3/4 of it away. The beans were good, but the rice was nearly flavorless. My son has chicken street tacos, and they were ok. If I go back, I'll definitely avoid the carne asada.",

I cannot say enough about the people who run the place. Both times they were very polite, attentive, and friendly. My wife wanted menudo but because it's hot weather they only make it on Saturdays and we went on Friday. I tasted my wife's menudo last time we ate there and it was as good as any I've had anywhere. It's beef tripe which means those who don't eat pork can partake. This place makes excellent frybread, refries from scratch which don't taste anything like Rosarita's,  and they even make their own chips. This is food made like you'd do it at home, and Maria's son said that's how she makes it. If you're looking for fancy you're in the wrong place. If you're more interested in authenticity you've made a good choice. Both times we were there others also left pleased with their meal.",

The restaurant sits in an unsuspectingly small corner, which is fine because the staff (presumably the owner) were all super friendly, enthusiastic, and obviously enjoyed what they were doing. For about 8 bucks you can get a huge frybread taco that is enough for two meals. By no means did they sacrificed quality for quantity. The fry bread was cooked to perfection, a nicely browned exterior with a soft spongy interior. I had the green Chile and red Chile beef split half and half and honestly cannot say which side I enjoyed more. Highly recommend this place and I can't wait to go back and explore the menu further.",

    "text": "With all the stellar reviews, I was probably over prepared for my experience at Maria's Frybread & Mexican Food. This small neighborhood Mexican restaurant in central Phoenix offers a standard taqueria style menu with the notable addition of fry bread options. They are located on 40th & Thomas in the strip mall on the southeastern corner with the large FRYBREAD sign in the window.  I am a fry bread junkie. There is just something about a deep fried piece of warm and chewy dough surrounding sweet or savory options. I know the troubled history of the bread and its unique status among modern Native Americans, but I can still appreciate its place in modern cuisine. Maria's was listed very high on Yelp for this, and I always appreciate my Mexican food when visiting Phoenix.  The interior of the restaurant is typical of most taquerias in the Valley, but the service was especially warm and friendly. My order was taken and served quickly, with a fry bread taco with red chili beef. I was rather disappointed with the overall choice. The fry bread is more like a sopapilla lacking the chewy and pliable texture of native fry bread, but even as a sopapilla it was rather bland. The red chili beef was also rather mild compared to many other places in Phoenix.  The chips and hot sauce were as warm as the staff which was nice, but it is hard to overlook the fry bread especially since it is part of the restaurant name and advertising. The mild flavor of the red chili beef would be expected at home in Sacramento, but seems especially mild for the Phoenician palette. I am glad I tried Maria's, but there are just too many misses to recommend coming back.",

Menu is pretty standard Mexican with the addition of the fry bread options. Think thick fluffy fried tortilla covered in green chili beef and beans. See picture. My favorite dish to order is the Pozole. That's right, Pozole! Is your mouth watering yet?  At your table they give you salsa and house made chips. They range in spice level from hot, medium, and mild. They are all good, but I like the spicy green salsa the most.   The decor is homey and fun. They have a drive through for call in orders but I haven't used it myself. You can tell they really care about their business and their customers. Well deserved.",

    "text": "We don't have frybread places in the Bay Area that I'm aware of, so decided to check out Maria's Frybread during my last trip to Arizona. My friend and I came for a late lunch around 2pm on a Thursday, and it wasn't busy at the time. We ordered and paid at the cashier, and they delivered our dishes at our table less than 10 minutes later. We tried:  -Carne Asada Enchilada w/Green Sauce ($3.49, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=x8LeSyv0cmGe9rvqCAAi3Q&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Yum, this was an awesome price for an enchilada, and I loved the cheesiness of this dish- Recommended! -Green Chile Sopapilla/Frybread ($8.49, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BNWV62Jzm6EUUTBFdGLaCA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): This is a GIANT piece of frybread, and it is loaded with toppings. I liked the chewy-crispy consistency of the frybread, and was glad I tried this, but I actually liked the enchilada more. This is worth trying once though.  -Guacamole ($1.49): Good, but not the best guacamole I've had. Worth ordering only if you are craving guac.  Service is ok, they are helpful but not the friendliest. There are a few tables to dine in, but they also have a drive thru option. If you dine in, make sure you use the different sauces available in the squeeze bottles in their soda fridge! I would definitely come back to try additional dishes if I lived in the area. Parking wasn't bad when we came since there were plenty of spaces, but the spots are on the smaller side.",

I could snack on this bread all day be perfectly satisfied, and not at all ashamed. *giggles*  The small restaurant has dine-in seating at a few tables and even a drive-up window.  I was thrilled to get soda from Mexico. There is a more intense taste. I normally buy Mexican Cokes, Maria's also carries orange Fanta. I ordered it and gulped down the entire soda.  I also enjoyed the taco with ground beef and a dessert fry bread to go. The dessert fry bread reminds me of an elephant ear from a fair. It comes with honey, cinnamon sugar, and powdered sugar. YUM! My order was right around $15.  The staff is friendly and accomodating. There is plenty to choose from on the menu. I can see why this place is a favorite of local Yelpers and travelers.",

Located in Phoenix, this tiny hole in the wall restaurant has impressive stats: 300+ reviews averaging 4.5 stars. BAM!!  We were greeted right away by a very nice gentleman when we walked in. It took us a while to peruse the simple menu posted by the register. The worker explained patiently and even gave recommendations. Thank you!  Green chili frybread taco ($7.49): I was picturing crispy shell and I was a little disappointed for a second when I took a bite of the chewy frybread. It's not bad, but I was expecting a crispy taco shell. My bad!   The green chili was amazing. The world stopped for a second and I was immediately transformed into my childhood, which was weird because I never had green chili when I was little. The worker asked how I was doing and I couldn't really answer her. The juicy pork nuggets were bursting with flavors. The sauce was perfect.   Carne asada frybread taco ($7.49): I took a bite of the carne asada and it was just okay.  The service was fast, helpful and attentive.  4 stars!!  Maria's Frybread & Mexican Food is yummylicious!!",

My husband split a sopaipillas before a beer tour, and it was plenty filling.  Bonus: there were three different types of salsas to top our savory fry bread with, all of which we liked.  Bookmark Maria's for a future budget-friendly lunch, and you won't be disappointed.",

I had the chicken enchilada combo with both the very tasty red adobo sauce and the slightly more spicy green sauce. I would go back there anytime.

It's not easy finding a place where all six of us are thrilled but Maria's Frybread happened to be one.  The service and hospitality were also A++; food always tastes better with great company.    We tried a variety; big burrito, cheese enchiladas, chicken and green chile enchiladas, a couple different frybreads of course, the tomales and finished with a fresh hot frybread that we put honey and cinnamon sugar on for dessert.   All was fantastic and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day.  Will definitely be back!!",

I got the frybread taco and my husband got the savory sopapilla. We got it with green chili that was amazing. I could have just eaten the green chili by itself. The meal also came with housemade tortilla chips and three kinds of salsa. The tortilla chips are addicting and the salsas are spicy and flavorful. The guys working there were really nice and helpful. I was kind of expecting a bare-bones operation, but they brought the food to us, checked occasionally to make sure we had everything, chatted with us about which menu items to order, etc. The decor is charmingly hole-in-the-wall, which I liked. We will definitely be coming here on a regular basis!",

I got the red chile frybread with beans, lettuce, onions, & cheese and it all overpowered the bread. The size of the plate was nice but I couldn't see my frybread at all, let alone taste it under the mountain of toppings. Its a shame because I was really looking forward to coming here. My girlfriend got a simple frybread with just beans and cheese and she too felt that hers was over-topped.

The burrito was large but the taste was not there.  Food was lacking in salt and seasoning.   The fry bread with beef, beans and cheese was super large but again, not tasty at all.  I added salt and it still did nothing for the dish so we both packed the food almost intact.  That was a $20 hit and no dinner.   The fry bread itself was tasty but after the beans and the cheese on top (not melted just Kroger shredded cheese on top), the fry bread became limp.  The beef tasted cooked, not grilled as there was no char on it.  Not flavorful at all.  Both dishes were disappointments.   I see all the 5 star ratings.  That just means that people don't know flavors or don't cook themselves or don't know what it's really supposed to taste like.    I wish them continue luck as they clearly have a following but it won't be me.",

I ordered the open faced fry bread with carne asada, light refried beans and green chile. Pretty authentic to me as I lived in New Mexico for many years so I know how fry bread should be. The bread was fried just right. Oftentimes you can see when the fry bread is over done because it is too crispy and burnt, but this was definitely not the case. Excited to go back and try the pozole next time.",

Being from the east coast it's hard to find authentic Mexican food so when I come west that's a first \"must do\" on my list.  I ordered  the Frybread taco with shredded beef with a side of guacamole!  My dining companions ordered the same!  Let me first say that the Frybread would have been perfect by itself!  Adding the refried beans, beef, veggies & sauces made it taste like a fiesta was going on in my mouth!  I also had the \"Jamaican\" juice which was very refreshing on this 109 degree day!  So, my advice is if you're ever in the area you will not be disappointed if you come here!",

It tasted like a cross between a taco and nachos. We also requested guacamole on the side, which enhances the dish further.   The red menudo was delicious! It came with a side of onions, cilantro, corn tortilla, oregano and red pepper to complement the dish. However, it did have a little bit sodium than I wanted (I was so thirsty after).

I was confused at first why there are bottles of salsa on the table and the chips are delivered with no bowl for the salsa. Solution? Add salsa to food. Eat food. Use chips for the remains. Perfection.  Tip from the hubby: Upon arrival at a new place, ask the employees \"what's going to rock my world\", or \"what will change my life\".

Don't forget to wash it down with horchata. Thanks for a great meal :)",

Started bad when I pulled up to the drive thru window and sat there for 5 minutes without being helped as I can see the girl who's supposed to be taking our order inside on her phone. So I finally gave up, went and parked, and went inside. As we walked in, the girl at the register still wasn't paying attention until we were directly standing in front of her. I asked a couple simple questions about a couple items on the menu and the girl was very short and in my opinion flat out rude with us. I ordered a burrito and when I got my food it was cold, there was a ridiculous amount of cheese that wasn't even melting, and overall tasted disgusting. Based on my experience, I personally would tell everyone to steer clear from here. Bad food. Bad service. Very unhappy customer.",

    "text": "OMG! I love this place. I would definitely say that they offer great comfort food with the frybreads! The bread had a really nice crisp outside and a lighter and fluffy inside. I would think that the frybread would be a little greasy but it was not greasy at all! I ordered the sopapilla with carne asada, which comes with refried beans, lettuce, tomato, and cheese on top of the frybread. Personally for me the bean made it a little to heavy for me even though the sopapilla itself was phenomenal. Next time, I will probably replace the beans with gaucamole instead and ask for extra lettuce for a more fresh and crunch aspect that I want. The salsas that come out in the bottle are really good. My favorite was the spiciest salsa that they have. It had really good flavor. I was a little disappointed because I was hoping it was going to be really hot but it was a little more on the mellow side. The chip here are homemade and I would not expect anything less of this family ran restaurant. The chips were delicious! The chips are thick and they are cooked perfectly to have this amazing crispiness and the texture was on point! I love that they have the fast food quickness but have the option to dine-in with actual ceramic plates. I really feel like I was coming into their home to have dinner. On top of it, since it is a family owned restaurant, the service was impeccable. The people who own this place are extremely friendly, helpful, and clearly care about the product they put out and their customers' needs.",

It may not be the roomiest place you've eaten in, but the food is great.  I haven't had fry bread for a long time, and last time I did, it was more of a taco style. This place serves it more tostada- or pizza-style. I probably could have picked it up and folded it into a taco, but I ate this one with a knife and fork so I could keep my fancy air-travel clothes clean (no, not really). Everything was fresh and tasty and I left full and happy.  I didn't think the green chili was terribly spicy, but it had good flavor on its own. Additionally, all three of the extra salsas had great spice and different flavors. Those were served with a bowl of chips while we waited and the chips were crispy and delicious.  They have more than just fry bread: enchiladas, tacos, tamales and more. I need to go back and try the other things! (So many options and so little time!) They even have family packs for take out (multiple tamales, enchiladas, beans and rice) at a bundle price of around $30.   Service was friendly and fast and I recommend this place. I'll be back for sure when I'm in the area at a meal time.",

It is a mostly Mexican food place but they serve Frybread by itself or in a variety of tacos.  The tacos can be green or red chili, carne, shredded beef and they will ask if you  want it folded over or flat.  On a corner of a small shopping center, they have tight indoor seating either near the front or down a corridor to the back.  Outdoor seating is also available.  They offer soda and Mexican drinks like horchata.  Place is clean and well kept. Very friendly staff who checked on our group of four often to ensure we were satisfied.  No issues other than a small seating area, and very casual, with take out, and similar to any small Mexican fast foodish kind of place.  Lots of owner investment.",

The people were very nice and accommodated all of our requests (even our after-orders)....  the cheese crisps were huger than the rest of the huge orders.  None of us could finish our meals.

We were greeted as we walked in the door, several people were already tucked in and eating their lunches and the smell was amazing!  I asked what should I get because I am a gringa and can't eat too much spicy food.  I was given a taste of the green chili and red chili so I could see what I could tolerate - thank you for that.  Who knew that I actually like green chilis?  When you are raised in the midwest from midwest parents, it's not ever on our menus.    I ordered the fry bread with green chili beef- not overly spicy, but zippy enough to get my taste buds excited.  It was the best thing I have eaten in a long, long time.  The building is small, with a limited number of inside tables, but there are additional tables outside and there is a drive thru.   I liked the fact that even though we took up a table for quite a while, no one rushed us out, we were able to catch up with family we haven't seen in a long time.  After our two hour lunch (with an additional fry bread with cinnamon sugar that I couldn't resist), we pushed back our chairs knowing that we experienced something really special.  Thank you.",

We enjoyed one frybread taco each (one green and one red) and it was more than enough for an entire, large meal! The portions are generous and the quality is great. If I lived in Phoenix this would be my go-to for a comfort food meal. So good!!",

I was greeted by a kind man who took my order: open fry bread w/shredded beef. When my credit card was returned to me, he said \"here you go Malinda!\" - saying my name was a nice touch! Once I got to my destination, I realized that my frybread was packaged nicely - sturdy plate with another plate on top and wrapped in foil. The utensils were taped together which I liked and I was also given to small containers of salsa. I enjoyed every bite of my delicious lunch!   Thank you for the excellent customer service and delicious meal! I can't wait to return! I'll be sure to spread the word about this place :)",

Never had frybread before & this is our 1st trip to Arizona so based on previous yelp reviews decided to make a trip. SO GLAD WE DID!!! frybread is delicious but the star is the AMAZING, DELICIOUS, SAVORY & A BIT SPICY GREEN CHILI!!!!! i have never, ever had a green chili so fantastic as this (my Abuela was a wonderful cook from Zacatecas but her chili verde would come in 2nd). Its got such great flavor and mixed with those creamy beans in the airy, light frybread, it was a party in my mouth and feet were doing a happy dance with each bite. The place is immaculate, small but table seating outside is available as is a drive thru. Everyone is so friendly and the service is quick, just fantastic. This was a meal i won't forget anytime soon and i may have to make a trip back to Arizona just to come to Maria's!",

Man behind counter efficient and pleasant, waited while I debated, then took the order smoothly. Food showed up in. A minute or two, three different salsas, mild, spicy and picante. Bowl of flour tortilla chips, unusual. The mild salsa is pretty mild. Tomato-ish. The spicy is green and full of flavor, with a nice kick. The picante is sufficiently so, with a smooth finish. Was hoping that the burrito would somehow incorporate a piece of frybread, but instead came wrapped in a standard flour tortilla. Will have to be more explicit in the future. Carne asada is tender, no gristle, and flavorful. Flour tortilla uninspired. Salsas are all nice, prefer the warmer two. The small side of lettuce and tomato was pleasant and fresh tasting. Maybe I'll come back here again, and next time make sure I get it on frybread!",

With our craving unsatisfied, we looked around for another frybread place and found Maria's Frybread & Mexican Food. We ordered the frybread taco from the menu. While we were waiting for our food, we were given tortilla chips with three different salsas: a mild green salsa, a \"medium\" green salsa, and a habanero red salsa, which was the \"hottest.\" When we tasted the three, we actually found the medium green salsa the hottest. My husband and I eat a lot of spicy foods, and I know that I have built up a tolerance to red chilies, so although the habanero red salsa was pretty hot, the medium green salsa was actually hotter for me.  After our frybread tacos came out, I used the green salsa to flavor my frybread. It made it spicy in a good way. Although it was a little greasy, I liked the flavors of the taco. My husband enjoyed his, too. If we are back in Phoenix, we will probably try Maria's again.",

Plenty of parking with parking in front and on the west side of plaza. Smaller place with a lot of seating for the size. Clean and neat. They have a small separate seating area to the rear of the restaurant.   I had the \"signature\" sopapilla w/red chili and my lady had the frybread taco. I joked w/the owners that their food actually looks like the pictures displayed. :-) The frybread was freshly hot with a good amount of red chili. They offer three varieties of sauce in squeeze containers; red, green, and \"hot.\" The red is a touch salty for my taste, but good. They serve you at the table and bring you pita-style salted chips. We were expecting a tortilla style chip but these were good.  Good size portions; a lot of food quickly delivered. We only waited a few minutes for the plates so if you have just an hour for lunch you should be fine. A drive-thru is also available. When you're almost done, have a plain, hot sopapilla for dessert. They will bring you cinnamon, sugar, and honey for toppings.  The owners are nice and friendly. It made the meal that much better.  We're from south Scottsdale so no more need to go to Fry Bread House on 10th St. and Indian School for fresh fry bread. Thanks guys!",

Very sweet, professional & beyond accommodating!  Was more than willing to answer any questions I had for him about the menu & his recommendation.  Also, a mother came in & asked for the use of the restroom without purchasing food but they didn't even hesitate in letting them use it. Like I said very sweet. Plus kept asking me how was my food & if I needed anything else.   The green chili w/ beans SOPAPILLA (it's open face compared to fry bread taco: which is folded). The green chili was drool worthy lol.  I could've ate an entire bowl, pot whatever they wanted to give it to me. Ok SOPAPILLA won over a bowl since it's edible & yummy.  And it came with homemade chips.   Love the fact it wasn't greasy; because, it made me feel a tiny bit better that it wasn't 'healthy'.  Definitely will come back & recommend.

First, let me say that the staff (all of them) were 6 star good! I see why the ratings are all so high! The place was clean and we'll stocked, a well run restaurant.  The food used good, quality ingredients AND the taste was just average. By average, I would visit this place again if it were back home.  But, I would not drive out of my way on vacation again.  This is a solid/basic Mexican fast food Mexican restaurant (3 stars) with excellent, friendly and attentive customer service (6 stars), overall 4.5.",

They have a few different types each day and we got a vegetarian one and green chile chicken one. Both were to die for and five stars for those. TBH though, I wasn't a fan of the sweet frybread here ... it was very thin and drowned in the toppings. Maybe better as a taco. But those were a two star. Everything was very expensive ($6+ for the frybreads). Then the people weren't very friendly, so the inconsistencies in everything brought me to my 3 stars. Just come and get a tamale and you'll leave happy!",

Super friendly and helpful. They made accommodations to make something our picky 3 year old would eat. They had great local recommendation and gave us samples of some of their other meat sauces. If we were locals we would be regulars. Great people and great food. Please support them!",

The place is nice and clean with a small dining area and additional seating in back of the restaurant. I had the green chili frybread with rice and beans. And, horchata for my beverage. Carlos (Maria's son) greets you with a big smile. I could see Maria in the back cooking. The green chili was tasty with chunks of beef. Also, the rice and beans were really good. My friend and I got a sopapilla to share. It was delicious and we got to add the powered sugar, honey and cinnamon to it. Overall, this place was a yummy local find. I hope the poor location doesn't cause its demise. Try it and you will not be disappointed.",

I am a vegetarian and my mom and I are both pretty sensitive to spicy foods, but everything we ordered was still jam-packed with flavor and the man at the front desk (wish I got his name ) was insanely helpful to us when we were deciding what to order, I had the frybread without meat and my mom had the shredded beef. I also highly recommend ordering the Jamaica juice if you have a sweet tooth! We also got an order of the plain sopapillas to-go because we were too full and I really wish I was able to enjoy them fresh from the fryer because they were still very tasty when we got home, but I can only imagine how good they would be right away!",

I'm a huge fan of frybread, and I've had some trouble finding a good place to get it in Phoenix. They offered a variety of different Mexican dishes, and I decided to try their red chili beef frybread. It was delicious! The dish is huge, and is covered in red chili beef, beans, lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes. They also serve tasty tortilla chips, and have three different hot sauces to choose from. It was about $7.50 and super filling. This combined with their horchata was perfect.  The workers were very friendly and welcoming. If this place were closer to Ahwatukee, I'd be coming here all the time. I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some top quality Mexican food and great service.",

My only tiny complaint is that my meal was about 10% more expensive than I would have thought - mostly through the soda - $0.80 cent refills on a $1.79 fountain drink?  I plan to return and eat there again - overall a very good meal and a good experience.",

The Green Chili has a slight kick but not to spicy and the carna Asada is solid.  The funny thing is the Frybread is the same thing as the sopapilla except the sopapilla is open faced and the Frybread is folded and the sopapilla is one dollar more.  The Frybread is not as fluffy as I am used to and a little bit more firm, which is not a negative,  but just different. I did like the crunchy texture of the frybread.   One thing I have to note is this is a small family owned restaurant and the people there have exceptional customer service,  they must have asked us 3 or more times if we needed anything else and even gave us a plain sopapilla to try with honey and powdered sugar. Super nice people and a different way to eat besides the old burger and pizza lunch.",

Everything is fresh and the salsas are great, especially the hot one in the small yellow container. Chips are hot and small (like a Tijuana surprise) and the guys running the place are the real deal - grateful you came in and proud of their food.   Positive on all points - I'll be back!",

Open for just under one year, the lack of a website or answered-phones making the storefront with a Drive-Thru the sort of place best visited without a lot of research, it was half-passed one that a party of three entered the former Burger Joint, an expectedly ethnic decor speckled by oddities such as octopus vases on the counter or Barbie and Ken on a swing hanging from the wall.  Dining with Spanish-speakers, though the staff was English-fluent, it was after brief perusal of a short menu that an order was placed, one large Horchata in a Styrofoam cup presented with complimentary Chips and three housemade Salsas ranging from mild Tomatillo to what the server described as \"inedible hot.\"  Waiting mere moments for plates from the kitchen, a few other diners previously present enjoying their Food, it was with all three plates presented at once that the small table was flooded, first bites of a crispy Tostada with refried Beans and Green Chili impressive in the range of its flavor and downright irresistible to a friend who reminisced of where she had previously experienced the smooth yet spicy taste.  Moving on to two Fry Breads, the word Sopapilla used to describe a plain disc served with Honey, Cinnamon and Confectioner's Sugar meant to be dressed to taste, the second selection was served folded with the puffy Shell light and virtually oilless around tender house-braised Beef plus bright vegetal flavors , Beans and Cheese.",

You can dine in the small shop or drive up to the takeout window, which is literally a sliding window on the far end of the tiny dining area near the counter and kitchen.     To me, the food was just ok. I tried the frybread taco which came with either green or red chili served on top. They offered me a sample of each and I opted for the green, less spicy chili. Not many toppings were served on the taco, mostly lettuce some cheese and a few tomato sprinkles. Came served with a few different salsas in squeeze bottles, the kind you usually see ketchup and mustard served out of in other restaurants.   I will say the service was really great. Very friendly staff. When I told them I had my own water they even offered me a cup with ice so that it was nice and cold. Super sweet and seemed like it may be family owned with the mom cooking in the back and father/daughter working the front area. Who knows if that's the case but they also seemed to know their customers personally and took time to make sure everyone felt welcome.",

My wife and I ordered the fry bread taco, one green chile and the other half each red and green. Both dishes exceeded our expectations.  The chile sauces were excellently prepared, delicious hot green Hatch and red chile carefully prepared to tease out every nuance and depth of flavors.  The chile sauces are among the best I have had and I spent 9 years traveling across most of the Mexican States where I sampled hundreds of different sauces, many uniquely, deliciously unforgettable. Maria is the queen of the kitchen and True master of this type of Mexican cuisine.  Her chile sauces are addicting as they are delicious.  If you enjoy Mexican food, you have to try Maria's.  I live an hour's drive one way to Maria's restaurant and I plan to return next week.  This place is a gold nugget among hundreds of copper shards.  Frank Rio Verde",

Still very enjoyable. I was not a fan of the carne asada and shedded chicken frybread without sauce, as it is very plain tasting in comparison to the green chili frybreads. One of the people who works there did let me know that the red chili is a milder option! The texture of the Frybread is definitely a key to what has drawn me back many times! One frybread will likely leave you unsatisfied so I recommend ordering an additional side. Overall, Maria's is worth a try if you are in the area!",

With the beans, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese on top, the fry bread was almost enough for two people. I was keeping the spice level low so I used the mild red salsa.  The whole combination was delicious. I switched between the fry bread and the chips as a vehicle for the meat, beans, etc. I couldn't finish it, but it was so good, I wish I could have!",

Chunks of beef in a green chili sauce that was perfectly spiced so that you knew it was there but not overpowering, served over a crispy sopapilla and topped with lettuce, cheese and tomato. To top it off, they served it with a side of house-made chips and a selection of salsas. My only regret is not being able to try the enchiladas or the tacos, or the dessert sopapillas.  Employees were very friendly and answered all my questions about how the beef and green chile sauce was prepared.",

I grew up eating frybread and was super excited about the reviews saying it was the best fry bread in town. First of all it came out really quick like the frybread was already made and not cooked to order which is fine if you can make bomb ass fry bread you can get away with it. Bread was cold and dry like crackers. The bread is the foundation of the taco when it comes to frybread tacos. You can have the best toppings on it but if your fry bread comes out blah you're going to have a blah fry bread taco. Gave 1 extra star because staff was friendly and there was good energy in the place. Toppings were good too but again the bread is where it's at.",

    "text": "We came for the fry bread, which was great, but really fell in love with the salsas. Both the red and the green salsas are excellent... and different from most other places in town. Lots of flavor and just the right amount of kick. Even though Maria's isn't close to home (we came here because we picked up a friend from the airport), we'll definitely be back. Oh... the staff was super friendly and helpful.",
