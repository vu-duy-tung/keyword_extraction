Great bar snacks and plenty of drink options during social hour, although I wish they used less gin and vermouth.  They may have had the best roasted nuts I ever had.  I already had dinner plans and didn't order an entree so I can't speak much about the actual food.  I did take a bite of my friend's cobb salad and it was pretty darn good, even though it reminded me of the smoked salmon salad at LGO.  I wish I got out of work earlier to catch their happy hour more frequently.",

The waitress was nothing but a fountain of knowledge about all things on the menu, which was helpful in making our selections for dinner.   Starting off with some fun, different, and delicious drinks was a great suggestion, and the mac and cheese on the appetizer menu was to DIE for. Great mix of food and fun here. Dinner came out perfectly timed, and our waitress was attentive and helpful. The food was awesome and quite different than we would normally get. Great options, and the chopped salad is awesome, and I don't like salad, so that's saying a lot.",

Citizen Public house simply substituted scallops for the shrimp and it turned out great. For desert I had milk and cookies. No kidding.  I've not had milk and cookies since I was a kid, and it was all that I remembered it to be. The cookies were an assortment of gourmet locally made gems so whatever type of cookie you remember from your childhood, it's probably represented here.  Some soft, some a bit on the hard side, which needed a little longer soak.   There are some great new cocktail ideas on the bar menu as well as some old classics that they manage to pull off quite well. All in all, CPH is a great restaurant.",

    "text": "Absolutely love this place! Came here on a date on a Saturday night in December, and the place was packed. With a reservation, you shouldn't have much of an issue though. Just a heads up, as with most places located in Downtown Scottsdale, you may have a tough time finding parking depending on the day/time you stop by. Anyhow, the place is adorable. It's a decently-sized restaurant with a lot of character. It's modestly decorated and the ambiance is pleasant.  My date ordered a gin cocktail, which was absolutely amazing! Taste was perfect and not too much flavoring to overcome the gin, which is always nice.   For dinner, I ordered the scallops and he ordered the prime rib. I didn't try any of his, but from what he said it was delicious. The scallops I had were the best I've ever tasted in my entire life. They didn't have an overpoweringly fishy smell or taste and literally melted in my mouth. Absolutely delicious! The only thing I would have to complain about would be that the greens the scallops are served with are rather tough, hard to cut through, and hard to chew. For dessert, we shared the bananas foster dish that they have, and it was pretty delicious as well.   Overall, I would absolutely return!",

We had booked a table but arrived early & instead of waiting, opted for 2 sides of a corner at the bar. Great choice, as the bartenders were chatty & generous with the drinks. The chop salad that everyone raves about is NOt over-rated, so get  it, & split it as an appy. My husband got the pork belly pastrami & I had some chicken entree, both were really good & our total tab was less than $80! I know I am used to SF prices but were happy we chose this place for dinner. I hear there is an outside patio but never saw it, but sitting at the bar is always fun & most times you can walk in & get a seat without waiting long or making a rez",

    "text": "Drove 30 min to check this place out. It made the perfect date night out with the husband. White table cloth, candle, menu that provided lots to talk about.  We got here 6pm on a Sunday night and were one of about 3 tables in a surprisingly big restaurant. By the time we left at 7:30 it was filling up nicely, but no wait.  Traded seats with my husband to have a better view of the bar which was romantic and manly at the same time (the bar, AND the gesture).  I ordered a Moe'scow Mule to drink (first one ever). Tasty and stayed ice cold my entire meal in that cool copper mug.  Hubby got the Original Chopped Salad and I got the other chopped salad - started with an M...Mir...I can't remember.  We SHARED which I highly recommend - these salads were a tastebud sensation - lots going on and they were different but both delicious.  Hubby ordered the Scallops (3-4 HUGE savory scallops, with gritts) and I ordered the Filet Mignon (cooked to perfection, awesome piece of meat, plenty to share with husband, on mashed potatoes and mushrooms).  We skipped dessert since we had Ben and Jerry's waiting for us at home. So lame I know.  Some deserts looked interesting - some involved BACON.  Bill came to $96.  This is a place that will keep you talking and bring out the foodie in anyone.  Enjoyed the ambiance, old 1920/1930's photos on the walls, and our knowledgeable/attentive server.  I'm feeling stingy with holding back that last star because I thought about a restaurant like DURANTS that might have a leg up on CPH.",

    "text": "Five stars for the cocktails, desserts, and service, four stars for the entrees I've sampled so far and the ambiance.  Over a total of four visits to CPH, I've sampled five of their cocktails and a number of their appetizers and desserts along with two entrees, met and interacted meaningfully with all three of the owners (including the at least locally-renowned Chef Bernie Kantak, creator of Cowboy Ciao's Stetson Chop Salad [which is recreated here]), and generally thoroughly enjoyed myself on each occasion.   The space is large enough to accommodate large parties or couples with equal aplomb. I've twice now toured the private upstairs space, and look forward to finding a fitting occasion to fill it with close friends.   I've had fantastic service upon each of my visits - twice sitting at the bar, once at a Yelp event, and finally for a normal dinner, and feel completely confident in suggesting CPH to the most demanding diner.   I'll update or edit this review to talk more about the food once I've had the short ribs and the lamb burger. The entrees I've tried thus far (the salmon and the chicken) didn't quite plumb the depths of my soul, and while the appetizers I sampled on other occasions were excellent, I don't remember any of them well enough to cover them in any detail. Hey, it was a busy month! I will say that the salads I've tasted are all amazing and that the bread pudding dessert was an absolute revelation right up there with the one delivered to John on the Isle of Patmos.  I've saved what I feel to be the best feature of CPH for last: the drinks. I could attempt to describe the feeling of anticipation I felt watching Richie rinse the old fashioned glass in preparation for a sazerac, or the deep happiness the feel of the froth of the pisco sour brings me when it hits my lips, or even the wistful yet satisfied feeling I got when I drained the last drops of the bijou (pronounced bizh-OOOh) from its martini glass, but I won't bore you any further - just go and taste (and *feel*) for yourself.  The wine and beer lists will certainly offer you something you'll love, should your tastes run that way.    In sum: good food and great drinks served by lovely people in a nice setting for reasonable prices. Far and away my favorite bar in Old Town.",

This time they brought out the wrong salad and brought out my partners 1st. You guys are great but I think you need to get that simple part solved. It's not fun when you guests get there's and your still waiting for yours.

    "text": "2nd time at Citizen and it continues to impress me. We recently went in for my a big birthday celebration. Not only did they accommodate our larger group of 8, but also put us in the best seats in the house located half indoor/half outdoor.  We had an earlier reservation which was great because regular dining was allowed to partake in happy hour dining and appetizers. We enjoyed $5 glasses of champagne, rose and house wine. A friend ordered a Mint Julep which he loved.   Service was friendly, quick and very knowledgeable. Everyone enjoyed their meal. I had the scallops over corn grits and it was fantastic!!!  Perfect portion of food. Don't let the three scallops fool you. They are large and tasted delicious paired with the corn grits.   I highly recommend for cocktails and appetizers or a meal. Great for a special occasion as staff goes out of the way accommodate and make your experience wonderful.",

Located downtown, tastefully decorated we were greeted and seated immediately.  At that hour still a lot of diners which was a good sign.  Menu has a lot of unique and interesting selections.  I ordered the duck burger, others the short rib tacos, the Mac and cheese and the meat loaf.  Everything was very good although some of spice combinations weren't to our liking.  Ate about half (portions are big) because we wanted to try desserts.  Had the chocolate cake, the ale cake and took home the bacon brittle.  Again, everything was great.  Service was fantastic and our server was a blast.  We'd definitely come again.",

We found this place on Yelp, of course, and saw that it had stellar reviews.  We got right in and were seated in the outdoor section and had AJ as our waiter. It was a fun atmosphere, well kept, and had a great appearance / decor. Our waiter was quick to give us recommendations when we were trying to decide between items, and was the first to tell us when he thought one thing was better than another. This is much appreciated, and as with other similar experiences, we've found the waiters who are willing to do so make excellent recommendations.   Our food was prepared perfectly. I had the lamb burger, which was seasoned well and came with a side of fries. I also tried their seasonal cider which was good. They have a full bar and wine selections as well. The patio area had a nice view overlooking the street. The price level was fairly average for a popular restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale.   My wife had the truffle grilled cheese, which she also enjoyed. For dessert we tried the brownie. It was a fudge brownie with chocolate chips and a scoop of ice cream on top, as well as, a caramel garnish. The only thing I would say that would make it better, was if the brownie was hot. Overall we had a good experience and I would be interested in coming back and trying other options on their menu.",

The room is a bit on the dark side but it's crisp linen and shiny silverware. The menu goes from very casual with bar food to sandwiches to maybe about a half dozen dinners.  Upton entering we were greeted warmly and whisked to a table. Our server was very professional, explained the specials and was friendly. The cocktails we tried were good and also packed punch.  We started with a special appetizer of an all house made plate of Tasso that came with  mustard and pickles. Everything was excellent even the pickled okra and pickled watermelon rind.  My plate of Pacific Rock-fish with curry millet and stewed okra and tomatoes was delicious as well. The fish was fresh, seasoned and prepared well. The curry millet was a curry for curry lovers meaning full strength flavor and was an interesting healthy alternative grain to use. Bird seed just never tasted that good before. I sort of feared stewed okra because I have had it before and didn't enjoy it's texture but in this dish it was enjoyable and anybody would like it because it had a fresh crispness to it and picked up the delicious sweet flavor of the small tomatoes.  I was too busy with my plate to try my husband's Amaro Meatloaf but he said it was very good and also enjoyed the potatoes. he said, \"they taste just like your potatoes\" I take that as a compliment.  The waiter described a very refined adult style nut butter and boozy fruit sandwich as dessert that I wanted to try but unfortunately I was too busy with my plate to have room for it.   Very very good  don't know if everything on menu is as good as what we tried but what we tried was excellent.",

Lastly, the chicken fried duck leg was not bad but compared to the other options I thought it was just OK.

We showed up at about 8:45 pm, put our name in and were told that it would be an hour wait. Normally, and hour wait for a popular place wouldn't have bothered me. Saturday night, Spring Training, etc... I get it. The only problem in this situation, was that the restaurant was half empty. I counted no less than 15 empty tables. So I pressed the host a bit and was told in a rather rude manner that the empty tables I saw all around me were reserved and that the best he could do is call us if something opens up. At this point I'm thinking to myself \"Hm, the place is only open for another 3 hours and all those tables are reserved?! There was no line of people outside, no one waiting to sit down inside and a bunch of empty tables... I'm confused.\"  I definitely felt like he, for whatever reason, just didn't want us in there. Maybe it was that we were still decked out in our baseball gear from earlier, maybe because I didn't stroll in wearing a Rolex and offer him $200 for a table... in any case, I've never felt so sized up in my life. Kinda ironic that the name of the place is Citizen Public House... clearly they're not interested in serving an average everyday citizen.  Can't offer anything one way or another on the food because I never got a chance to try it. What I can say, is that I left that place very upset. Not a welcoming place, at least it wasn't last night.",

    "text": "A double date dinner ensued within a strange blend of cacophony & a bit of intimacy--as long as our conversations were more vociferous than usual.  As a gastropub, nestled in the Old Town of Scottsdale, CPH equally focuses on their large, encircling bar, practically in the center of their contemporary, fine dine-esque ambiance.  Speaking of bar, I began imbibing on this weirdly calming Persian ($9), evidently consisting of cucumber juice, wild tea vodka, & the wondrous St. Germain elderflower liqueur.  DL, Angela T, Kurdy S, & I initially shared with one that's highly recommended that you'd have to check CPH's Facebook for their ingredients--we knew & tasted why.  The Original Chopped Salad ($12) was marvelously delicious & amazingly textured for its strong yet well-balanced ingredients: smoky salmon pieces, perfectly firm couscous, verdant arugula, perfectly crunchy freeze-dried corn, humble aged asiago cheese, & intricately robust yet controllable dressing.  It may look so modest, but based on the numerous items (including some I didn't list here) I can imagine splurging half of them just to amalgamate this healthy salad.  Then each of us got an entree that we were personally hankering for.  I persistently leaned on the Lamb Burger ($13), which I thought it was juicy, well-seasoned & quite vigorously gamey.  The Kennebec Fries were consistently textured well while surmounting a strong aroma of truffle oil.  Though to be frank I would've greatly raved for this burger if the Serbian Lepinja roll (aka the buns) weren't stiff, which deemed too difficult to cut it and become safely shareable.  At 1st we were expressively reluctant to order the Buttermilk Roasted Chicken ($20), which was a white meat dish.  But after asking questions & then receiving well-thought consultations from our exuberantly friendly waiter, we're so blessed that we didn't choose the alternate (which was this Rockfish plate). It was the biggest chicken breast I've ever delved into--at 2 days of marinating, followed by some grilling sensation--pleasurably savoring into such incredibly moist, sweet & savory, & complexly scrumptious hunk of lightly colored meat.  Whether eaten alone or with the poultry the sweet corn-butter bean succotash was indescribably tasty, though the Brussels sprouts here were more in a bitter side for my palate.  Conclusively, I would have graded CPH slightly lower due to the burger, noise bouncing off the walls all-over & difficult menu-perusing in a very dimly lit atmosphere that maybe a few chandeliers would be more helpful, esp for photo-taking =P.  Fortunately, our applauding, exceptionally knowledgeable waiter &, consequently, the utmost deliciousness of the chicken and salad made a surprisingly outstanding dinner for me that I'll gladly present this Scottsdale eat a 4.5.  Although we arrived w/o reservations, the increasing crowd later in the night would speak for itself.  And if you're completely unfamiliar w/ its neighborhood, you can either park street for free at their 3-hour limit or, if they're not available, on one of those parking garages.",

Service was phenomenal, we had a very professional yet personable waiter who knew the menu backwards and front.  Our main course included the the chop salad, coffee rubbed shortribs (cherry bbq sauce), and amaro meatloaf w/potatoes. The rib portions were small but made up for it in taste and quality of cut. Our heart of caramel and mint chocolate budino were perfectly refreshing as finishers- both the mint ice cream and roasted white chocolate ice cream were incredible!  Presentation was all very photo worthy, but we restrained ourselves ;)  Atmosphere is open and lively, moderate lighting and white table cloths, small candles atop- the bar is right in the center of the room. Our party of two went on a Monday night- I'm sure it would be much more crowded on a weekend. It's right in Old Town Scottsdale, after all. I definitely recommend anyone to try this place- I'll be back soon.",

The menu changes, but there are some items that have been there from the beginning.  The chef was big into bacon when he first opened up the place, but there are still hints of it like the bacon flavored popcorn.  I do miss the bacon in the bread pudding.   The place is really noisy.  Low ceilings with hard surfaces tend to reflect every word across the room.  Their sister restaurant The Gladly has a similar menu, but is much more quiet because of the high ceilings and carpeting.  The only problem is The Gladly is by the Biltmore Fashion Square and I live and work in Scottsdale.",

He was a fountain of information and did a wonderful job explaining the whole menu. He recommended the tossed salad as an appetizer and it was a great mixture of texture and taste that was refreshing. I chose the meatloaf entree and yes you may think it is just a home style classic but this meatloaf was elevated in taste and the zucchini was cooked perfectly (wish I had gotten more than three slices, but succulent each of them). I was stuffed but when the desserts were explained to me, I could not resist and ordered a the trifecta dessert that included fudge, strawberry ice cream and brittle. Delicious! This was a great find in Scottsdale that was pretty close to our hotel. Bonus!",

I am from the south so I was a bit weary about trying grits in Scottsdale, but they did not let me down :)  Meatloaf I didn't have much to compare to but it was pretty good and my boyfriend loved it.

    "text": "Meh.  If anyone asked me what I thought of Citizen Public House in Old Town Scottsdale, that would be my reaction.  The ambiance was meh. The food was meh. And the sangria was meh.  In fact, the highlight of my meal was when one of the cute bartenders (at least they have that going for them) delivered our drinks instead of our server.  The interior is bare bones and plain. The white walls are covered with a smattering of vintage photographs you'd have to squint to see-from a table not by a wall, the atmosphere isn't artsy, it just looks like bad decorating in someone's living room. I didn't really understand why butcher paper covered the white tablecloth-covered tables, since that sort of took whatever class the spot had and negated it. The seating wasn't comfy, and even though there was a patio, it was tiny and overlooked a parking lot.  There weren't many vegetarian menu options on the small American menu, so I opted for a Grilled Cheese ($12). My gut told me to leave off the Peruvian Sweety relish, a weird red mixture, but I kept it on because I figured it had to contribute to the sandwich somehow. I was wrong. It tasted gross, and I ended up scraping it all off and wishing remnants weren't still stuck to the sandwich. I got it with a non-noteworthy salad, and I've had much, much better artisan grilled cheeses that were less expensive and more filling.  My friend said she liked her chopped salad, the same one I've had at Cowboy Ciao (it's a creation of Citizen Public House chef/owner Bernie Kantak, who used to cook at Cowboy Ciao.) I also liked it there, but it's so tiny, I can't justify paying $12 for it-especially since I'd leave the meat off.  Like I said, the sangria failed to leave a big impression on me, other than that it wasn't strong. For $9 a glass, I expected something with a little more kick to it but was left disappointed.  I can't think of any reason I'd tell someone to go to Citizen Public House. If the atmosphere had been a little prettier or livelier, maybe it'd be a fun destination, but the company I had was the only thing that kept it from boring me.",

We were on the waiting list so we went to the bar for some drinks and noticed that there were at least 2 table in front of us that were clean and empty. Waited for a bit and asked hostess why we weren't being seated when there were tables available. They seated us right away thereafter.   We ordered family style - mac n cheese, pork belly pastrami, chicken & waffles, crab cakes, and bacon popcorn. Food was great. Loved the cheese they used for the mac n cheese; pork belly pastrami I wasn't even look at on the menu but tasted it and it literally melts in your mouth; the breading on the chicken was unique (in a good way, not your typical breading) and the waffles and syrup with some kind of nuts on top that was delish; bacon popcorn i didn't see what the big deal was but then again I don't get the whole bacon craze but all the guys devoured it at the table.  Tried 3 different cocktails all with a unique taste, all excellent. Bartender isn't too attentive, it was hard to get his attention may be because I wasn't sitting at the bar? But it wasn't like he was busy or anyone else was asking for drinks so no bueno on that.  I asked the server (2 because they switched on us in the beginning) to bring out bread because I was starving and the menu said you had to ask for it. The bread didn't come out until after the food, major disappointment.  Overall I can't say much for the service but the cocktails and food are good enough for me to want to come back which says a lot about the eats. Everyone was friendly but may cause I came at the end on a Saturday they were tired? Anyways, worth checking out and definitely order family style.",

Then I tried their signature chop salad and I highly recommend it. For dinner I had the filet mignon which came with potatoes and a veggies.... Yumo... The other attendees ordered both scallops and the buttermilk chicken... All looked amazing. The dessert was nothing to brag about and def. not their strong suit. I had cypress Chardonnay (wow) and their coffee wAs amazing. I will def be back. They aren't cheap but the good was worth it...",

It has it's own bar and it's a great spot for parties or I guess for a romantic date (there're no cameras, I believe, lol).  The food was good, like in between of good and really good (not outstanding, though).   The service was great and friendly, but I guess this is irrelevant when it comes to a private room, I mean, if you get bad service there, the place just sucks!  We tried several dishes and i can't remember anyone that I didn't like.  The salad with steak was tasteful, the fondue was really good as well as the mac&cheese, maybe one of the best mac&cheese that I've eaten recently.   The pork belly was good too.  Short rib, steal head and filet were solid but not memorable. The filet was a little hard, if you ask my opinion but it was cooked right, which is hard to find in AZ.  The apple pie was also pretty good and a normal serving, not the typical \"feed 10\" disgusting kind of desert.   Great place for parties, dates or just friends dinner.   It worth the try.",

I made a reservation 2 weeks before and our table was ready 15min before (awesome!). The service was perfect, professional in every way and polished. The prices I felt were very reasonable especially for a holiday. A few places I'd called had a pre-fixed menu (as did Citizen) but I felt more drawn to their offerings so came here. Everything and I do mean EVERY THING we had was absolutely delicious! I'm still thinking about it.....One of us is a vegetarian and I LOVE being able to go someplace that knows what to do with veggies that isn't boring. I had a spectacular cauliflower steak over a farro salad that was just amazing. It had everything I loved, flavor, textures, good portion and a nice balance that was quite filling. As an appetizer I had the chopped salad w/out salmon and one bite in understood why everyone raves about it so much. WOW!!!! Definitely will be going back. My gf ordered the filet mignon which was served w/sweet purple mashed potatoes, wow. All in all, excellent meal and experience. Definitely would go back. Looks like an awesome place to celebrate happy hour, special occasions, date night or a night out with friends. Loved the vibe. Thank you Citizen Public House!",

After a long day, my best friend and I got hungry and were craving mac 'n cheese so we strolled into Citizen Public House.   We were warmly greeted by the most amazing and kind-hearted bartender, Will. He was super quick with getting us our drinks, and (I swear he was lightning fast) getting our order of mac 'n cheese in. They all must've known how hungry we were 'cause our food came out in the blink of an eye -- or so it seemed. The cheese was ooey gooey, and the pasta was cooked exactly perfect. It was topped with a tomato something -- which gave it an unique and mouth-watering flavor.   The mac 'n cheese was so good it was gone in 2.2 seconds. And what's the logical thing to do when your amazing mac 'n cheese runs out? You order another bowl, of course!!! Will was so incredibly sweet, he bought us our second bowl of mac 'n cheese, which totally made our night! Thank you, Will. And management -- he deserves recognition for his superb customer service (perhaps even a raise? Christmas bonus?). Matter of fact, the whole staff deserves recognition for their excellent service -- from the bartenders, to the bussers, to the kitchen that prepared the scrum-dilly-umptious food. The whole experience was incredible! The staff was quick, attentive, friendly, personable, and anticipated guests' needs before they even had to ask for anything. Keep it up, guys and gals! You're awesome!!!   We couldn't finish our second bowl of mac 'n cheese last night so we took it to-go... Smartest idea ever!!! I'm reliving the amazingness of last night as I write this review. So.Incredibly.Yum! Thank you, Citizen Public House!",

They call it the \"Family Room\" ,I felt so special and VIP!  We ordered a round of specialty cocktails and we each tried a sip of one another. They were all very good.  Not your typical mai tai or sex on the beach drinks but one that required some skills.  Since it was late and we've already had dinner, we ordered some bar snacks and starters.  The waitstaff was extremely patient with us in explaining the drinks and menu, taking pictures of our group and efficient with our orders and requests.  Kudos to the team!  All the snacks were delicious ! My favorite was the burrata and the bacon fat heirloom popcorn.  if I lived in Scottsdale, I'd visit again. Until next time...",

When we arrived we were told to wait another 15 minutes for our table, but it wasn't a big deal. The restaurant is very loud, rowdy, crowded. It seemed like everybody was celebrating their birthday or bachelorette or something or another in here.   I opened up the menu and was surprised to see that it was actually Asian-fusion. When I had originally seen pictures on Yelp it looked like more of a gastropub/American restaurant. I had planned on getting the chopped salad because it looked so colorful and yummy in pictures, but couldn't resist the Duck Burger when the time came. My man ordered the Buttermilk Chicken. To share we ordered the Grilled Octopus as an appetizer.  The octopus was great but was soaked in a very strange spicy tomato sauce that was lukewarm. The whole thing kind of tasted like it was sitting on a bed of ketchup, honestly. I think mostly what threw me off was the temperature. In addition to small cuts of octopus, the dish came with hard cubes of grilled bread that were tough to chew.  My man's buttermilk chicken was delicious. It was very tender, moist, and flavorful.  My duck burger was just ok. The duck was honestly rubbery and not very flavorful.  Thumbs up for some risk-taking with the menu options, thumbs down for the quality and delivery.",

    "text": "Came here this evening with family while I was visiting from out of town. The area where the restaurant is seems really lively and hip but it seemed quiet, even for a Sunday night. One down side was that the restaurant seemed to lack atmosphere. It seemed really dark in there too.   We were seated immediately and our waiter was really great. He was really knowledgeable about the food and drinks, asked me where I was from (and even remembered at the end of the meal), and truly made us feel at home.   We decided on the bone marrow to start. The pancakes it came with were delish, but I didn't really taste the marrow. The meals were: short ribs, cod, scallops, and the deconstructed chicken Cesar. Everything was really delicious. I had a particular craving for meat, so the short ribs totally hit the spot we finished our meal with the peanut butter push pop and some of their bacon brittle. The push pop was good, but the brittle was hard to eat... my teeth were not diggin' it. I had really wanted the cake, but they were out!   Overall, it was a lovely evening! I'd definitely recommend.",

I was coming in and was told that I could not bring in my water to the restaurant.  I have been to five star restaurants and I have never been told this, however here, no water.  Go figure.  It does not even matter if you have health issues, you cannot bring in your own water.  Very strange.  The service was very good and prompt.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable on all the different drinks and recommendation on the menu.  Very genuine as well.  We settled on the Pork Loin for dinner.  The salad was just ok as the house dressing has a blue cheese kinda look and feel and taste.  Not my taste and no Ranch.  They really do hate California in Az.    LOL   The main course was cooked to perfection!  It also tasted as if it was brined.  So juicy and tender!  Highly recommend it!    For dessert we had the peanut butter push pop ice cream dessert and that was also very tasty.  So great service, very good food, just don't bring your water!!  LOL!!!",

I couldn't take them just anywhere with sub-par food...that would make me lame. So after some thinking we went here. And I'm so glad we did. They accommodated us by giving us our own private area, which was super nice with two young children. The interior was nicely decorated and dimly lit, making it a romantic and intimate setting. However, we noticed it was quite loud inside. On to the food.   The food was fabulous. I highly highly recommend the chopped salad, which is what they're known for. It is so popular, the salad has its own Facebook page! We also had the pork belly pastrami, the grilled octopus, and the bacon fat popcorn for appetizers. Every single one of them were unique, savory, and very good. I was happy with all of them.   Our entrees were the scallops (ahhhhmazing!), Chia crusted tuna (very good!), Italian beef sandwhich (sooo good), meatloaf (big portion and savory!) and Cornish hen (though tasty, not the best dish).   We are very pleased we came here for dinner. We had excellent service from our waiter, Kent! This is a new favorite.",

It's a lively place and very trendy. For dinner, we split the pork belly pastrami and chopped salad as appetizers. They were both so amazing! The pork belly was tender and delicious and just awesome. Seriously, get these two apps and you won't be disappointed! For our mains, I had the scallops, and the others had the bavette steak and duck burger. We all LOVED what we had. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the grits underneath were to die for. The steak was super tender with awesome flavor. The duck burger was the same.  We topped it off with a fabulous cab from Conn Creek. I highly recommend trying this restaurant. We would certainly return if we're in the area again!",

    "text": "I wasn't too excited to come here, since coming to Arizona I expected to be eating Mexican food. Now I'm sad this gastropub isn't on the East Coast. I forget the name of our waiter, but he was very friendly and extremely tall.   The food was delicious. Here's a rundown.  Appetizers: The Original Chopped Salad (corn, couscous, smoked salmon, asiago, pepitas, tomatoes, arugula, currants, buttermilk pesto dressing) - Despite all the raving reviews, I was really skeptical on how good a salad would be. Damn it was good. The textures were party-in-my mouth good. The buttermilk pesto dressing gave it a perfect tang. Do yourself a favor and order this above anything else. <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTheOriginalChoppedSalad%2F&s=39ea96a931358d9908ed67d81492bfe47e335359c16f011580b25824771fe220\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">facebook.com/TheOriginal...</a>  Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut, mustard jus) - The pork belly was melt in your mouth, although some off-putting parts were all fat. The brussel sprouts were shaved leaves. I was confused by the rye spaetzle. Couldn't tell if it was meat or not, but overall the flavors of this dish are good.  Chia Seared Tuna (Thai purple sticky rice, asparagus puree, fried leek & micro green salad) - This dish was a bit bland overall. Both the puree and tuna had no flavor, but the purple rice provided a good contrast of texture. I love purple rice in general though.  Crispy Chicken Gizzards (pickled lemon, garlic yogurt, shiso)- The gizzards were dry, made a little bit better with the sauce. A little lackluster compared to the other appetizers.  Entrees: Tender Belly Pork Chop (dried apricot sorghum, shaved cantaloupe and asparagus salad with pink peppercorn vinaigrette) - This is on the pricey end, but definitely get this for entree. We ordered this medium and it turned out very juicy and well marinated. Good pork flavor. The quinoa provide nice contrast of texture and dried apricots provide extra sweetness.  Fair Trade Short Rib (coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg) - I also recommend this for an entree, despite being pricey. So tender and the flavor was delicious. The bed of mashed turnips was a good combo. The tangy sauce is an explosion of flavor when it hits your tongue.  Yum Neau Wrap (grilled beef tenderloin, watercress, cucumber, mint, cilantro, yuzu vinaigrette, Thai eggplant & pickled cabbage slaw) - This was so overpoweringly salty. I could not taste anything it was wrapped with. The best part of this dish was the pickled vegetables, but overall I would not recommend ordering this.  Desserts: Pig in the Orchard (Apple bread pudding, bacon, brown butter ice cream) - This was recommended by our waiter as his favorite. Good recommendation by him, because this made dessert my favorite part of the night. The bread was so soft. Not sure I could taste the bacon This is a must get dessert  Cocoa Jar (chocolate coffee pudding, crispy rice crumble, whipped cream, cocoa cookies)- Not a big fan of cream, but everyone else in my family loved it. liked the cookie crumble on top and the cocoa cookies. There is a cookie/brownie at the bottom of the jar. Make sure you dig into the layers to get every layer in a bite to bring it all together.  Dim Lighting, fantastic food. Extremely popular so make a reservation if you can. I will definitely miss that Chopped Salad very much.",

All were good but glad to have split the burger as it was very rich and intense. Loved the fries as they cooked very crispy on the outside but pillowy soft inside.   Bone marrow - wasn't a ton of it but liked the mini pancakes underneath. The hush puppies were the best out of the apps. Chopped Salad is always a winner, great crunch and flavors.  It wasn't too busy for a Friday night but our Server wasn't around as much and noticed he was more attentive to the other tables around us. The only difference was that we were around 20 years younger than the other tables. Other than that, enjoyed our meal and drinks @ CPH.",

Burrata - if you only get one thing, this should be it. Short Rib- presented on the bone with a new coffee rub and a cherry vinegar sauce on the side, a parsnip puree as the base - cloying without the vinegar. Duck - thick sliced, I suggest ordering medium plus (the medium order was a little rare), excellent quality, nice flavor. Flourless chocolate cake, very nice but I think I've seen them at AJ's.  Nice selection of after dinner drinks.  Ok wines by the glass.  Great cocktails.  Loud loud loud, mostly tables.  Really good service.  Reasonable prices.  Ok but not awesome.

We had the highly rated items, which were also put forth by our server:  Chopped Salad, pork belly, and the sushi-grade scallops.  Yes the salad was good, but it's a salad.  It won't bring world peace.  However, the pork belly and scallop preps that day WILL change the world.  For the better.  These are hands-down the best scallops I have had in a long time.  And I am a snob ;).  Service was efficient and friendly.  I could see the crowd being annoying (for my taste) on a busy night, but the food is seriously good and the setting is comfortable.  I will be back for another afternoon snack.",

I honestly didn't expect much out of this city when it comes to comestibles. But Citizen Public House surprised me on all levels.   The cocktails here are crazy good. They even have a little 'speakeasy'-ish mixology lab upstairs that's all secret and only accessible by... wait... can I tell? Anyway, these folks are making some interesting drinks with house-made infusions, tinctures, and various chemistry equipment. Better than the best drinks in PDX? I don't know about that, but impressive all the same.   The food is a very big surprise for me. The chop chop salad is, from what I understand, legendary, and from tasting it I am not surprised. I also sampled some tasty meatloaf and delicious scallops. The fact that I can't recall the dessert doesn't mean it wasn't memorable, I think it had to do with my focus on the drinks and mains. I recall everyone at the table enjoying them.   Service? Impeccable. 'Nuff said.   Consider me a little humbled.",

They were great about taking and honoring our large reservation, and we only waited about 15 minutes for our tables to be set up, which was pretty reasonable for the group size we had. The servers that helped us did a great job of keeping our glasses full, and were very attentive, despite how many of us there were. My boyfriend and I started with the deep sea crab cakes, which were amazing!! I'm also a huge fan of the chop salad, so I knew before we walked in the door what I'd be ordering! No one in our reservation had any problems with their food, and everyone seemed to really enjoy the dinner. I'm so glad I chose CPH for the occasion; the ambiance is great, the food superb, and the service wonderful as always! Thanks for a fun, celebratory evening!",

Tom, our bartender, for most of the night, as we sat at the bar was incredibly friendly. After hearing it was our first time, he tossed us some free bacon popcorn (popcorn with bacon lardons on top). The drinks here are top notch. At happy hour (4-6) you can get half price beers and half price on many cocktails. They have a bunch of house aged cocktails which are killer.  The food here is not to be missed. The chicken, yes, i said the Chicken, is great. Sure, most restaurants have chicken on the menu as their throw away dish, not here. Here they braise the breast in buttermilk and serve it will Brussels Sprouts and a sweet corn and butter bean succotash. I also tasted the house made pork belly pastrami. Everything here is great, and the bartenders are all friendly.  If you are here for business or pleasure, you want to stop at citizen public house.",

    "text": "I really want to like this place, the service was fantastic, I liked the decor, but the food was just 'Meh'...in my opinion, where my hubby thought it was outstanding, so I will go with 4 stars and tell you my tale.    We were at fashion square doing some Christmas shopping and needed dinner, and we desired a 'gourmet' burger, when we did a yelp search this place came up. With the 4.5 Star rating we decided to try it, before reading the reviews. We called and were able to get a 9 pm reservation, which allowed me to do some more shopping. Perfect!   We arrived and were immediately seated. However, we kept getting the wind from the entrance. We asked our server if we could move, and he was more than accommodating, and we had a new table in just a couple of minutes, even though the place was very busy. The new server was just as great. You can tell, they focus on providing an awesome dining experience through service. I LOVED THIS!  This is what I didn't like - the place was so loud, that we couldn't have a conversation. In fact, I got a headache before our food even came out. There are two factors at play - the bar is in the middle of the restaurant, and when people drink they get loud. Also, they have high, open ceilings, without anything to 'absorb' the sound, so the loud laughing and all conversations, bounced off the walls. This esculates as the place fills up and when it is full, like it was last night, everyone is talking and laughing louder than normal, to the point where I heard people almost screaming. All this is bouncing off the walls, giving me one large headache. So there we sat, in silence, texting each other and facebooking because it really was too difficult to have a conversation.    After looking at the menu, and asking the server if they have hamburger, we found out they only had lamb burgers. While the reviews are good, they really aren't our thing. So much for Gourmet Burgers. We felt the menu was limiting, and our eyes were more focused on the desserts than anything else. The appetizers also looked better than the entrees, it seemed that there wasn't that much I liked, or if I did I felt it was overpriced. However, we were hungry and you yelpers love this place, so we decided to try a couple of entrees. We ordered the Chicken and Waffles appetizer (for the kid), while we split the scallops and the buttermilk chicken entrees.   We also ordered bread, which brought my attention to the fact that there were no salt and pepper shakers on the tables. I happen to like a little salt and pepper in my olive oil for the bread; which tells us, as foodies, the chef thinks that everything is prepared to the perfect seasoning and you don't need salt and pepper shakers. I will tend to disagree. I probably should have asked for them, I am sure they would have brought some, but I didn't.    Our food came. I got 3 scallops for $24. They were fantastic; however, 3 scallops and some greens, no matter how good, is not worth $24, maybe $14. Thank goodness we split the entrees! I thought the buttermilk chicken was good, but not outstanding and liked the corn, it had a bit of a kick. However, I will say I do not like brussel sprouts, and I liked these (A+ for those). I sampled the kid's chicken fingers and I LOVED it! You can tell it was prepared in-house. The kid didn't care for the chicken fingers all that much but he loved the waffle, it was gone in about 30 seconds. And I felt the $10 price was spot on. The hubby actually didn't care for chicken fingers, but really liked the buttermilk chicken and he also loved the scallops.    Because all the desserts looked amazing we had to try them. Again, I was a bit disappointed; they all had great flavor; but nothing I would crave again. The pudding jar was such a unique dessert, but I felt like I was eating peanut butter out of the jar, and I was hoping for something a bit lighter...a pudding consistency. The apple pie was good, but it was all crust, it needed more filling. The gingerbread pudding - very good! (I was not disappointed, even the ice cream was awesome).  So, has you can see, I am torn in the review because there were some things that were truly outstanding, where others fell short. I liked the concept, I like what they are trying to do with the menu, I like the decor and I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the service. I wish there were a few more entree selections. I would not rush to go back here, but I do want to go back. Also, I wouldn't recommend bringing your children, especially if they are picky like mine is!",

Every plate we ordered was delicious, except for the dessert. We ordered some flour less mint thing (I think?) which wasn't that great, but everything else made up for it.

He also had stories and recommendations that would have made me order a plate of dirt, he was very convincing and passionate about the menu.  I also sampled the dishes that my other friends ordered (scallops, chicken) and those were excellent as well.  OK, so now that I got that out of the way, WHAT THE HELL IS WITH THE CORKAGE (OR LACK THEREOF) IN ARIZONA?!??!  We brought a bottle of wine, an expensive bottle, and as soon as we walked in they informed us that Arizona has only one or two restaurants that allow you to pay corkage and drink your own wine!  I thought Arizona was full of conservatives, and we all know conservatives love to drink so what's the deal?    We were disappointed, we wanted to drink our delicious wine, and since we were there for spring training and the night was young, we carried around an unopened bottle of wine all night and had to explain at every single bar we entered what it was all about and had to also promise not to open the bottle in the bar, as if we would waste such a great wine on just getting drunk!  Annoying. I will not deduct a star from this wonderful restaurant because of the wine situation, but I will tell you that I am giving the WHOLE STATE OF ARIZONA only one star for their stupid corkage regulations.",

    "text": "Having read these reviews i expected more. So very compelled to review myself.   Service excellent, atmosphere classy and chill, menu, same as atmosphere.   Gastronomically this place is classy, definitely aspires for that modern blend of fresh farm ingredients and high fat natural  elements like butter, cream bacon and cheese. TOO much bacon on this menu for sure, jews and muslims must not apply.   Food:  Pita and Hummus from Bar side of Menu: Oddly the best of the 7 things we had! I ate it up! the pita is too good, i think it's fresh baked, falls apart into s gooey bready goodness, the eggplant hummus amazing especially when combined with these little sour pickles that it's served with. YUM  Gaspacho- the tomato puree with slices of cucumber and radish was only ok, flavor profile definitely weak, resembled baby food to me and i LOVE good gaspacho, could have backed a little kick, even pepper would improve it, but the 2 shrimps that came inside it were cooked to painful perfection. Definitely executed well, the recipe itself is blah, won't have again.   Chopped salad- everyone raves about this salad, and it's good, but it's really not that good at all, it's own facebook page? ah sounds like a fad to me, the dry freezed corn in it is a let down, it's crunchy sure, but the seeds are enough crunch in there, but actual corn like grilled off the cob would have given this salad a gravitas it really needs, ground it, earthy it up, because it's  very light, it's got lox and seeds and etc so it's got various textures, but somehow nothing stands out so it's like a pleasant mush in your mouth, i think most of all it could be improved by a better dressing than the generic ranch it comes with, i might have had an entirely different impression of it if the dressing was lighter, sweeter, more acidic and again perhaps more peppery or spicy-sorry to say but this salad didn't stand out for me, and i live for salad  Watermelon salad- very different, never had anything like it, worth having just to try, beautiful on the eyes, but really is more of  cheese and watermelon plate, playing on the old and wonderful combo of fruit & cheese, take a bite of your watermelon with a bite of the cheese and maybe a salad leaf, it's tasty.   Scallops- Good normal well assembled dish....TOO MUCH BACON, must the gorgeous delicacy of a well prepped scallop always be obstructed by bacon? Over wrought, I feel like this trend ought to be retired, i get the appeal of surfy turfy plates, but scallops themselves are enough, i don't need them floating in bacon fat(not literally, they are served beautifully) surrounded by chunks of piggy, it's not that clever bringing the demise of these very contrary creatures onto the same playing field, we get it, none of gods creatures are safe when humans crack open their cookbooks, the novelty has long worn off for me, decadence is better served by letting one or the other shine, and not having them struggle on a plate for attention like two adopted siblings.   Grilled cheese sandwich - Sort of awesome if you are willing to take in about a weeks worth of fat and cholesterol, it's stuffed with mashed potatoes, you can taste the cream in them, truffle oil, caramelized onions and cheese, bread is soaked in butter cooked with egg, it's rich as hell, tastes really good, i could go with a little less rich and  little less butter, but i am not sure if the function of a good grilled cheese sandwich is not precisely to be rich, so i am torn. I think though i would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't such a heartattack cubed on a plate, came with a cute salad i enjoyed, and strange throw away veggies that looked better than they tasted.  Bread Pudding: We had to send it back, may be the worst i ever had, and that's rough but not an exaggeration. Hard dry old tasting coarse bread situation with icecream on top. Huge let down and not consistent with the quality of the food they served prior to it. i expect something of sublime quality even if not to my taste, but it was just a yucky afterthought.   Pros: other than the Bread Pudding food is quality, carefully assembled, thought out fresh and pretty. Everything is Cooked right. Service GREAT   Cons: Bread basket, stale and boring with surprisingly not good olive oil. no way to start a meal.  No coffee drinks other than espresso and no milk variations other than whole. a non fat latte would have really made my night.   Happy dining.",

    "text": "This place is wonderful.  We arrived during happy hour (Sundays until 6 PM) so several of the drinks were half-price as were several of the Appetizers. We had the original chop salad which was fantastic (rate it a 10) and was tossed at the table. We also had the butternut squash gnocchi which I would rate an 8.  We also had the Barada which is an eggplant, mozzarella,  grape tomatoes, kale and breadcrumb dish which i would rate a 9. The only negative of the entire experience was the pork belly pastrami which we found to be very fatty and had to return. Our waiter Sam was absolutely excellent and added to our experience greatly. Overall great Experience.",

I had the Citizen and she had the Mule (a vegetable type of adult beverage).  Finally we had the bread pudding dessert which was good. Restaurant was half empty but we were lucky they could squeeze us in without a reservation so I suggest you reserve before you go. Overall an enjoyable experience.",

    "text": "Citizen Public House truly epitomizes modernist cuisine.  For example the pork belly is prepared as a pastrami, the entire preparation from before its even cooked, the spaetzle resembled french friends and even includes brussels sprout sauerkraut.  Some of the cocktails such as the Im-Port, featuring leather and tobacco bitters, sound really strange but when combined with the other components just work.  This a truly first class dining destination and one of the few places I've been to in Arizona I could see working in east coast cities such at Philly, NYC and Boston.",

Hands down best cocktails in old town, everything from their sangria to their Manhattans are made fresh and it's clear the recipes have been thoroughly tested. Same goes for the food.  We mostly go for the drinks and the reverse happy hour appetizers, but their dinner menu is also superb.  There isn't a huge vegetarian selection, but what they do have is tasty and filling.  Some of my favorites are the kiltlifter fondue, hummus, burrata and kale starter, and the truffle grilled cheese.  I've honestly never made it to dessert because there is never any room. Someday... but as long as they keep up the quality I'll be a CPH superfan for life =)",

The food here is solid, the drink menu is pretty decent, the ambiance is nice, menu is good, service is eh.  We, like others, sat around a while waiting for a drink order to be taken. We ordered the flat bread with hummus and tzatziki. The hummus was excellent and the little pickled veg that came with it was excellent.   I had the original chopped salad after that and it was really, really good. I loved the combination of the flavors and textures. The waitress mixed it up for me and I had only a drizzle of the dressing since I didn't want everything swimming in it. A drizzle was plenty! I had mine with the smoked salmon, our friend had hers with the chicken. I would come back for this salad alone (and those pickle things).   Husband had the pork belly pastrami which was just a little bit too salty but the flavors were great, the rye spaetzle was very unique and the brussel sprout saurkraut was very good.  Overall, I would come here again even if the service isn't fantastic because the ambiance is nice enough that waiting around and enjoying good company is fine.",

The food was also excellent. We started with the chopped salad, which is the classic Cowboy Ciao chopped salad you could never go wrong with. I followed this with the chicken which was cooked to perfection with a risotto side.  My wife had the grilled cheese which she enjoyed (though not her favorite).

I order my first drink and an appetizer. Some guys sit by me.  They are having their first drink if the night.  And after 20 mins the bar man gets a stick up his ass about all of us and refuses to serve us all and returns all the food.  I have no idea what the hell got his goat.  After the other two guys left I was so disappointed I called over the manager who supported the bar guy without question!  Really?  Whoever the owner is they need to really look at the over sensitivity of their managers. Great food, great vibe,... Usually...  Unfortunately spoiled by poor management staff with self confidence issues. Good luck guys you just lost one regular and a few locals.",

    "text": "Great service, reasonable prices and a lovely atmosphere.  I'm giving it three stars because the menu was a bit limited and I wasn't entirely happy with any of our food. We started with the pastrami appetizer. The flavor was great, but the meat was a straight up slab of fat. I mean, it was the type of fat that you cut off your meat and push to the side of your plate. I would never knowingly purchase a slab of fat, so it was pretty disgusting. When I asked what was in the chopped salad, they explained to me that it had salmon. Since I like Salmon, I ordered it for my entree. The problem was that the salmon was not the grilled kind, like I had figured it would be, but the smoked slimy lox and bagel type of salmon that I hate. It was all mixed in my salad, so I just did my best to eat around it, but it was pretty hard to do that and it ruined what seemed to be an otherwise great salad. I think they should tell diners what type of salmon is in the salad. My husband ordered the lamb burger and his response was \"Meh.\" When I asked him what was wrong with it, he just said \"It tasted kind of bland, like something was missing. That said, the prices were good and I really wanted to love this place. I just don't think I'd go back, unless they changed their menu since everything we ordered left us a little disapointed.",

After dinner as we were leaving I remarked to our waiter about our experience.

The hummus platter appetizer was definitely better than any I've had.  The homemade pickles on the platter and on my lamb burger were delicious--remind me of my grandma's in Iowa!   I would have given them 4 stars, but after filling up on the flatbread and hummus, I ate less than half my dinner and had them box up the leftovers. Should have been a red flag when the gal took multiple plates back to the kitchen. What a bummer to open my box this morning hoping to see lamb burger and fries and see somebody else's leftovers. Not only am I mad, but whoever got mine will be disappointed too. One mistake--two unhappy customers! I suggest they bring the boxes to the table or have the staff label them.",

The mixologists (dare to call them Bartenders haha) explained history and components of each of the drinks which was great and also gave some reccomendations based on the palate of the group.

Best bang for the buck, if you will. That may not seem like much based on my number of reviews, but I've been around - The Mission, Roaring Fork, FnB, La Petite Maison, 5th & Wine, Mastro's City Hall, Tommy V's...I really should have started a Yelp account a long time ago. In any case, with the exception of the lamb burger, I have been thoroughly pleased with everything I've tried. Their bar is well stocked, and service is great - somewhat casual but appropriate, attentive, and not overbearing. Two recommendations: The pastrami (starter) and the scallops (only 3 to an order, but still worth a try). The chopped salad is good too, just a tad small. Remember to take a picture of it before it gets tossed tableside.",

Very funny and knowledgeable of the menu and knew the dishes inside and out.  We started with the tzatziki and hummus plate..so addicting.  We shared the signature chop salad and let us make it very clear....GET THE F*ING CHOP SALAD!  The way it's plated is all separated and mixed table side. The salad has a unique blend of marinated tomatoes, smoked salmon, pepitas, couscous and a bunch of other shit I forgot. I should have said before the food I had a martini or two so my attention to detail on the menu was a little skewed. We also shared the scallops that were cooked to perfection placed on grits and spinach.  Even the bread and olive oil were delicious.  One of my favorite places to dine in Old Town Scottsdale.  Will definitely return and highly recommend!!",

    "text": "One of the best restaurants in Scottsdale. I'm a foody and have high expectations when dining at nice restaurants. So often I leave underwhelmed. Not the case with CPH. We ordered the crab cakes to start, had the applewood smoked duck and the pan seared scallops. Lastly we washed it down with Tracey Denpseys apple pie creation. The food was wonderful and reminiscent of the fine food you get in NYC....and to top it off, the service and ambience was Stellar, though a tad noisy. Our server Lex was on top of it and the food came out fast. This is one of those places that even if the service was horrid, the ambience stunk, and the wait staff were ass weasels,  you'd still find your way back here because the food is that good. Well done Bernie Kentak!",

We decided to order off the regular menu and everything we got was so delicious. The burrata was great and was served on top of an eggplant puree--I hadn't burrata served like that before, but really enjoyed it. I ordered the rockfish which was great; however, the curried millet with okra that it was served with stole the show for me. I seriously could eat that every day and might have to try to recreate it at home. My husband ordered a fish that was the special for the evening. I can't remember what it was, nor did I try it (isn't this review incredibly helpful??) but he did say he loved it and ate every bit, so that can't be a bad thing ;) Peach and berry pie for dessert was great, although it was heavy on the berries and light on the peach. But who can really complain about that? The service was great; our server was attentive and the food was timed nicely. Overall a great experience!",

The room is very spacious and beautifully decorated with a nice ambiance. The service kind of confused me, because I'm used to servers wanting you in and out as soon as possible. Here, they get your drink order, then get your appetizer order. They don't get your meal order until AFTER you finish your appetizer, just in case you change your mind after eating the appetizer. The head chef, I believe, of the restaurant personally delivered our appetizer and chatted us up for a good 15 minutes. We got the pork belly as our appetizer and it was really good, basically melted in your mouth. I ordered the AZ BLT and my friend ordered the grilled halloumi cheese. Both were REALLY good. The BLT came with homemade bacon and the cheese on the grilled cheese was super tasty. I ended up switching sandwiches with my friend because I enjoyed the halloumi cheese more! We finished off the meal with the bread pudding which, like everything else, was absolutely fabulous. I'd give the restaurant five stars, but the drink orders took FOREVER. This was there only downfall. Besides that, I would definitely return, especially to check out the sexy, bald bartender with the tattoos.",

The Meatloaf was dry and taste more like a Salisbury steak.   The bad:  Service was the worst. The appetizers came out quick, then the waitress forgot about our drinks, entrees for a good 40 mins. She finally came around and realized that we were not being served and finally got our meal which was room temperature (because she didn't pick up when it was ready). She was serving a larger party as well, and was tending to that table the majority of the night while neglecting us.   Not sure what all the hype is about, but you can easily get a better meal elsewhere along with better service.",

Another must try which is great for sharing is the signature salad. Im not a salad person so very rare that i'd recommend to try it.. Its that good!   Be sure to also indulge in there amazing hand crafted cocktails as well. Happy Eating!!!",

Just thinking about it makes me want it. If i were to revisit Scottsdale, Arizona this may be the first spot i go to or the only spot i go to. Not only for their salad but also for their scallops with grits and pork belly pastrami. Citizen Public House delivers with ambiance, service, and obviously delicious food. Looking around at what the other tables ordered and from what our server had said each dish they offer is a customer favorite (and each table either had exactly what we had on our table or other dishes we thought of getting) and I believe him. Each dish we had was rich with flavor, seasoned perfectly, and just melds perfectly at each bite.",

CPH did the latter. Tonight's example was the entree. Simply the worst piece of Ahi Tuna I have ever seen. It was prepared perfectly, but the filet itself was pretty much one piece of connective tissue. Whomever was cooking it should have rejected it and not served it up in the first place. Our waiter gasped when I showed him. He knew it. The whole inside was a white inedible chunk. I couldn't get my knife through it. Furthermore, I hate being that guy to send something back. I've eaten many a grizzly piece of whatever because I feel uncomfortable being that guy. But in this case it was totally warranted. In less than 5 minutes I had it replaced with the scallops entree (which was fantastic), and was also comped another beer, and dessert. As for the rest of the meal I had the Grilled Octopus appetizer with the spicy watermelon gazpacho. It was exceptional. 10 out of 10. A truly memorable dish. In a town with a lot of great octopus appetizers (Virtu, Sassi), this was creative and delicious. A can't miss. My wife had the famous chopped salad, which she said was great as well. She had the tuna crudo for an appetizer and it was also delicious. Service 5/5 Food 4.9/5 Despite the error with the ahi tuna Citizen Public House is becoming one of our favorite restaurants and we'll be back again and again.",

The wagyu burger, made from meat that is considered one of the most fatty cuts of beef, was dry probably because the chef cooked it medium well instead of medium rare per our request.  Minus 1.   The fondue light kept going out, minus 1.   But the waiter made it his mission to keep it lit all throughout dinner, so plus 1 for service.   The fondue accompaniments were aite.  Nothing to write home to mom about but they did have asian pears.  Plus 1. The pork belly dish was freaking amazing.  Caramalized brussel sprouts, spaetzle, it was all done to perfection.  The only thing wrong about it was that there wasn't enough.  Plus 2.   Beers during happy hour were 2 bucks.  Plus 1.  -1-1+1+1+2+1=3 stars",

I ordered the Sangria, which is house made and it was quite good but a bit sweet for my liking. The scallops were from Maine and the entire dish was enjoyable but scallops were more gritty than normal (I love scallops). The purred grits that they are served over top of was very tasty and it will give you a cream fix for those who don't, or can't eat cream based sauces. I can't usually do desert but I was able to love and tolerate the flour-less, gluten free chocolate mint cake. It was more like a fudge but way lighter! I also had a a nice glass of ice wine from Canada (the best area by far for ice wine) and it was perfect!  The waitress (Cat) was very very sweet and pleasantly knowledgable about the menu. Perfect for this type of Restaurant, while attentive and happy! This is a fine stop in Scottsdale.",

We were starving afterwards and I yelped this place. I'm so glad we did because it was one of the best places we've ever eaten at ever.   A lot of credit goes to out server, Gib, who was just as excited about the menu as us. Hubby was craving a good sandwich and Gib recommended the BLT. Hands down, BEST BLT ever thanks to pork belly bacon!!! It was thick cut, tender, and crispy. It elevated the BLT to a much higher culinary level. I opted for the chopped salad which has been reviewed in top mags and culinary shows. With it's mix of greens, tomatoes, sweet corn, pumpkin seeds, currants, and this amazing buttermilk, herby dressing I almost ordered a second one! We had the gorgonzola Mac and cheese to share and it was perfect for 2 people. It was super creamy, delicious, and decadent.   For dessert, Gib recommended the pork belly bread pudding. Holy bacon!!! It was the perfect combo of salty and sweet with a scoop of vanilla on the top. I had the cream cheese donuts with 3 different dipping sauces: strawberry compote, key lime pie, and caramel. So delicious!!  We were incredibly surprised by this place. Not only is the ambiance beautiful but Gib definitely made the experience better. The food was some of the best we've ever had. In fact we haven't stopped talking about it since we left and I've never yelped a review faster!! The food reminds us of how delicious food is in the Bay area where we're home. We would easily drive down from Vegas any weekend just to eat here. 5 stars!!!!",

They offer a full menu at the bar as well. The happy hour is arguably the best in town.   If you prefer to sit at a table you will be graced with an attentive server with an exceptional knowledge about the cuisine, cocktails, wine list and much more.   I suggest Citizen for small or large parties. If you call ahead and need special arrangements they are always accommodating.   Personally I love sitting at the bar, grabbing a Bijou from Thomas and enjoying some of Bernie's Mac'n'Cheese.   But in a larger crowd, Gary is always wonderful at coursing our dinner and making sure the group has enough to eat and he always sneaks in a few laughs.   Overall I love CPH! And you should too!!!",

We got here pretty late so I was surprised they were willing to seat us.    We had the 'Tender Belly' Pork Belly Pastrami, 'Kilt Lifter' fondue, and we were intrigued by the \"Pig in the Orchard\" Bread Pudding so we ordered that as well.

However, the majority of the food just felt \"meh.\" The cheese fondue, although cute in appearance, wasn't very tasty. The crab cakes had a bit too much breading and the short ribs were a bit too dry and over cooked and scallops were a bit chewy.

    "text": "This place has it all:  creative chefs, customer service, family friendly and a good bar.  Let's start with creativity.  Each menu item had a unique twist to it, and it was so much fun to try it all.  For appetizers, we had bacon popcorn (what a combination!) and the grilled endive salad.  The salad was so unique and so amazing, I would love to be able to create it.  For main dishes, my daughter and I shared the scallops and the short ribs.  The scallops were served with sweet pea greens and sweet corn grits.  The short ribs were served with a parsnip base and greens.  We loved everything about both plates.  The 3rd person in our party got the trout which was also a hit.  This is a tablecloth and linen napkin, dimmed lighting and front-and-center bar kind of place, but it's also family friendly.  We were there with my 3 month old grandson, and I could tell that kids are definitely welcomed here by the attention that was paid to him.  Speaking of creativity, the bar menu was delightful.  They have classic drinks on the menu, but they have created their own signature version of each drink.  I wanted to try a drink, the Blood Moon, but thought it might be too sweet.  Our server said she would have the bartender make it for me, and if it was too sweet, she would take it back and I could try something else.  Well, it was too sweet, she took it back, and I got their version of a Manhattan that included maple syrup.  Knowing I didn't want something too sweet, our server asked the bartender to take it easy on the maple syrup, and my drink was perfect.  The only downside to dinner, but not enough to take a star off my review, was the maple Pot de Creme' that we shared for dessert.  The ginger snap cookie in it was yummy, the flavor of the pot de creme' was good, but some of it was gritty or grainy like they didn't quite get it cooked correctly.  Did we eat it all?  Yes.  But after a perfect dinner experience, it was a bit of a disappointment.  Next time I'm in Scottsdale, I want to return to CPH.  There are menu items I still want to try.",

Wife and Son had the short ribs - they loved them. Huge portions. They only ate half their meal.  Should have split.   I had the scallops. Very good.   Drinks were perfect as well.  Just a super experience all around.   Thanks",

    "text": "I never would've imagined that I'd write a review based on a salad! I don't even like lettuce! Yet, here I am...writing about the world's best chopped salad!  1) Occassion:  For my first birthday weekend in AZ, Ryan made a reservation for us here. As soon as we walked in, we were seated at a very cozy and romantic table(it had a candle, that's romantic right?!).   2) Service: Our server (also named Ryan) was the sweetest guy we've ever met! He had the warmest smile and treated us like we were the only customers there! Although he was servicing several tables by us, we felt he was there the second we needed him!   3) Food: The chopped salad is to die for. When it's brought out, the ingredients are layered vertically. Our server mixed it up for us with the dressing and I think that's the best way to eat it. I saw a table near us eat one section at a time and I think that's missing the point! (Who watches others eat..this weirdo)  The salad consists of lettuce, salmon, sunflower seeds, corn, and some sort of green dressing. It is super good! I want the recipe so I can make it every day!  *Seared scallops: Also to die for!   4) Ambience:  It's a fairly small restaurant with cozy seating. There is a bar in the middle. Although we were here for a birthday, it seems pretty awesome for happy hours etc.  We'll be back regularly!",

Perfectly tender and moist, the chicken was served on a bed of some vegetables (wish I knew the name) covered with sauce. You'll probably have room for a dessert!   The service was exceptional. Our waitress was very attentive.   I would also describe this place as upscale casual. The tables have white cloths, but I noticed other patrons wearing upscale casual attire with flip flops. I'd definitely recommend a reservation if you're coming in with more than 4 people and during rush times!",

We ordered the burrata, the house chopped salad, and the short ribs are must haves if you can't decide. I'm not even a large salad fan but the chopped salad is pretty famous for a reason. Service is excellent and man those mixologists are skilled because all our drinks were great. We came as a group and I read a review that says it's not good for groups, but I completely disagree. This spot is perfect for a group of 10 as long as you put your reservation in far enough in advance.",

This last time that I went we ordered a few of their barrel aged cocktails off of their happy hour menu and these did not disappoint at all! Great flavor and even better prices. The happy hour hummus and flatbread is an incredible deal too. I ordered the scallops with grits and the scallops were cooked beautifully but there were only 4 medium sized scallops on the plate. I understand that scallops are pricey but I think they should have been much more generous with the amount of grits to compensate for the small amount of scallops. Service was awesome this last time that my wife and I came. I believe the servers name was Paul and he did an absolutely fantastic job. Overall a great place I just think it was a little small for the prices. Would absolutely come back for happy hour!",

Their cocktails are amazing and the food was even better. The table shared the Mac and cheese - superb, chopped salad - probably one of the best salads I have ever had, and the hummus and tzatziki plate. For dinner we ate the meatloaf, short rib, filet mingion, filet mingion tacos, and the hamburger. Everyone was more than satisfied with their meal. We topped it off with bread pudding and the peanut butter chocolate cake for dessert. There are a ton of great restaurants in the area and this one did not disappoint. My only complaint is that it was a little loud inside so at times it was hard to hear one another but otherwise we really enjoyed ourselves.",

    "text": "We stopped by for Restaurant Week (and as a final hurrah before getting on the keto diet bandwagon - wish me luck) but even though Citizen Public House currently sits at 1600+ reviews and four and a half stars, it was a little lackluster.  Tip: You'd probably want to call in more than a day ahead of time to get a seat inside the restaurant and not at the bar. We didn't think of this beforehand and wound up with patio seating, which though limited, was actually pretty nice. It's a lot quieter than it is inside, which though wasn't a bar, had the noise level of one. One downside was that it seemed like our waiter handled all the tables outside. So I'm not sure if he was stretched thin or he was having a bad day, but I've had cashiers who were more involved than he was as a waiter.  That aside, the food was mediocre. I was blown away by the salads - both the chopped salad and golden and red beet salads were amazing. One was savory, the other sweet (in that order) but they were by far the favorites for me of the entire dinner. Not saying they weren't phenomenal, but the other dishes were kind of...meh, in my opinion. For the main course, my husband ordered the scallops while I got the monkfish. I preferred the scallops even though I thought I'd prefer the monkfish as it sat in lobster bisque but I guess I had expected more, but it wound up being a dish with the same flavor throughout - no nuanced flavors and textures as I would have hoped. The scallops weren't spectacular either but I just like scallops so that was pretty much it there. Unlike the many other restaurant week offerings from the other restaurants, I was a little disappointed to see that Citizen Public House only had one option for dessert. It was a cobbler which though looked good, the saving grace was the shortbread which had a bit of lemon in it to cut the onslaught of berries and compote. I love berries, don't get me wrong but well, I expected better.  It was a nice dinner and I'm glad that I stopped by to curb my curiosity, but next time this place comes up, be it during restaurant week or otherwise, I don't think I'd be as eager to stop by.",

Also I asked to keep my burrata left over app to eat with my salad since that's the only protein I they had Togo with the salad.   The Burrata is amazing and their drinks and food are good but on the pricey side.  We have two people order the trout and one chicken dish.  They came with amazing vegetables and sides.

We did not have to wait for a seat on a Friday evening around 7pm for two people. I can imagine a long wait on Saturdays though.   We shared the pork belly pastrami, chopped salad, and meatloaf. It was way more than enough food for two people. My favorite dishes were the chopped salad and pork belly pastrami. I love the way the food was presented as well. I thought the meatloaf was just okay. I would probably pass on that next time.  The waiter was so nice and split our meatloaf into two separate plates for us because he knew we were sharing the entree! At first we thought he accidentally ordered 2 of the dishes, haha. Overall this is a great restaurant with amazing food and would recommend it to anyone!",

Citizen Public House is right up my alley.  Excellent service, drinks, and of course, amazing food. When our crew eats out, we order almost everything and share family style (whether it's an Asian restaurant or not). We tried practically everything, and I loved almost all of it.  Highly recommend: - burrata appetizer - cornmeal fried catfish appetizer - pork shank entree (giant entree btw) - any fish they have (they know their fish)  Hard pass on: - Mac and cheese (sounds great but had zero flavor) - meatloaf entree (just ok)  Watch out for: Paper cuts on your forearms from the paper they lay on top of the tables. SO PAINFUL!  This is one place you will leave happy, full, and ready to take on the Scottsdale party scene as the restaurant is located right in the center of the action.",

    "text": "The ambiance is stylish and relaxed and the menu offers a manageable selection of American fare with a nice twist making them each inventive and unique. I figured we should try their prix fixe menu due to the special event week, but decided to delve into the regular menu for an additional starter. Their Grilled Octopus caught my eye, served with spicy watermelon gazpacho, chorico, fennel, fried capers and bacon fat brushed Noble bread. It was a stellar choice - stunning and delicious!  For their Restaurant Week selections our table opted to begin with their famous \"Original Chopped Salad.\" This amazing salad even has it's own Facebook page! Trust me, I know..I looked it up! And they even give out the recipe on it. Well, it was absolutely scrumptious and you can bet, I'll be trying it out for myself. We also tried their Clam Chowder, done exceptionally well, creamy yet light, topped with herbed croutons and a drizzle of finishing oil.  For mains we selected:  Pan Seared Scallops with tender belly Hampshire bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens and cola gastrique. Seared Ling Cod with bok choy, red miso beurre blanc, pickled papaya and hazelnuts. Grilled Pork Loin with fava beans, baby shitake mushrooms, fennel puree, pickled mustard seeds and pork demi.  I did say inventive and unique! They were all super yummy and nicely adorned.  Dessert was included, although unnecessary as we were quite satiated with our meals. However, knowing that Tracy Dempsey was at the wheel creating their luscious sweets, we had to try one of each. The Black & Tan, a chocolate pot de creme with salted caramel pudding, whipped cream, roasted white chocolate streusel and browned butter shortbread. And the Bourbon Peach Bread Pudding served with vanilla ice cream. Are you salivating yet? They were seriously decadent, but kindly served in small portions with just enough to satisfy the four of us.  Our server, Greg was personable and friendly, knowledgeable and attentive ensuring we were well taken care of. Yes, this is going on my repeat list...I'm definitely going back for another taste. And since I was duly impressed, I plan to try Bernie Kantak's other restaurant in Phoenix, called The Gladly!",

This was my second time having it and it was worse than my first; maybe I just don't know how to appreciate marrow. Or bones, really.  Squash was delicious and the ribs just melted in my mouth - went really well with the mash potatoes and mints. Def recommend if you are in the area!",

I did like everything they served me, with the exception of the mashed parsnips.  It was very nice on the inside and a relaxing classy atmosphere.  When we arrived there were only 2 other tables of people seated in this large place.  They seated us all in a row, right on top of each other and we did not understand why they wouldn't seat us all in more of a private setting.  This really took away from the experience since we're were packed on top of each other when we all could have been seated in different areas.   We started off with the melted cheese dip, which was good. We dipped bread, pear and sausage into the dip. We also ordered the side of olives which was yummy, Just fresh green olives to share.  For the entrees we split the chopped salad, meatloaf and the short ribs. All were good and we enjoyed them.  So why the lower review? Compared to other meals at this cost, we weren't blown away.  I do take this into consideration when I rate places.  I do have to say that the chopped salad was bomb!  If I ever go back it will be for some happy hour appetizers and for that delicious chopped salad!   Lastly we ordered the push pop dessert. I did not care for the brownie nor do I like frozen bananas.  We did have great service though and I loved my mixed drink of the day.    It was a toss up for me on what to rate.. but after all this was a pretty pricey meal that just wasn't very memorable.",

I got on the short bus and started the ride with a Hemingway Daiquiri (I thought it sounded studious, it certainly tasted smart) and some bacon popcorn--no surprises here, but hey, it's bacon right? The bell rang and first period began with pita, hummus and tzatziki.  From there I got seriously edu-ma-cated on cuisine 101. Second period brought the chopped salad, it was everything it was chopped up to be, a fantastic formula of texture and style that managed to balance salmon, cous cous and freaking trail mix, which is an equation I'll never unravel. On to third period, a study break with the Lost in Translation cocktail, an immensely lush melding of tequila, yuzu juice and lemon peel. Fourth period delivered scallops on roasted corn grits with--you guessed it--more bacon! I'll just say this about the scallops: the best I've ever had in the waterless West. Oh, and I couldn't remember all the answers so when the teacher wasn't looking I had a bite of Aimee's Amaro meatloaf, which made me so fat it almost got me expelled.   I seriously considered skipping fifth period. There wasn't any room left to cram. But when the bread pudding and fudge brownie walked up to the chalkboard, all of a sudden I was hungry for more learnin', which was miraculous because I now know that \"bagel crisp streusel\" isn't just food, it's a straight-up philosophy.  This is your brain on bacon, butter and bagel. You'll be cooked.",

He is Vietnamese so he is hard to please.

It actually was not the kind of place I'd normally really choose to go to, and I kinda felt weird about the crowd when we pulled up outside but it ended up being better than expected.  Despite the name, it is a very chic kinda wine bar small plates kind of place which is what I was surprised about, but out of real options and starving we went in anyway.  They had a decent but pretty small-ish sized selection of craft beers.  That said, I ordered the lamb burger and I'm really glad I did.  It came out and it was just perfectly cooked, a perfect, juicy medium rare, with incredible tzaziki sauce, delicious cucumbers, all on a quality ciabata type roll.  It came with good fries and homemade ketchup.  I really don't remember much else because I scarfed down the whole thing but remember it being incredible the whole way through.  Anyway, I don't know that this place is my scene overall but I do think that the lamb burger at least was definitely worth a stop in to try.  As a side note, it was also romantic than you'd actually expect from a restaurant with that name too.",

The dumplings rubbery and not sure why it was on the plate. I had the taco from the sandwich menu. Corn was just awesome perfectly seasoned. Tacos I expected the meat to be a little more moist a nice salsa would have worked better than the onion thing that came with it. All in all food was ok with some real standouts but the price... Not a great value.",

It made me look at salads a whole different way.  Stay away from the chicken and waffles. I'm not sure if I just got a bad batch but it was way too salty.",

Front of house staff were so kind and accommodating, and the service didn't end there.  Bradley - thank you for all your suggestions.  You perfectly timed the courses, helped with the wine decision, and were simply great.  When I looked at the menu a Chopped Salad was listed so I asked.  Turns out the chef at CPH was the chef at Cowboy Ciao who developed the Chopped Salad.  As far as we could discern both salads were identical and equally delicious.  Hubs and I shared the Scallops and Buttermilk Chicken.  Scallops were perfectly seared and served over corn grits w/bacon that were the lightest I've ever eaten.  The boneless chicken - difficult to cook and not dry out - was so tender and moist, served with Brussels sprouts and succotash, a great combo over the typical (or what I serve) mashed potatoes.    The only negative I would add is that this place is LOUD, and could definitely use some noise mitigation.    Absolutely no room for dessert, we waddled back to our hotel.",

The beer (6 drafts) is half price but NOT in mugs as some other reviewers have said.  Standard pints.  For $2.50 a pint, it's still not a bad deal.  Today they had Jever pilsner, Chainbreaker white IPA, Firestone DBA, Hop Knot, and Guinness for $2.50  and Goose Island Matilda (12oz) for $4.  Dead on HH on Friday.  They are clearly more interested in the dinner crowd.  I'd also rate this place three $$$ as it's VERY pricey.",

The entrees were average to small portions. I had the short ribs which were dry. The greens were undercooked and extremely bitter. My wife had the meatloaf which was also very dry.    The kicker to the evening was when we asked out waiter James to split the checks. His reply was rude and condescending but did eventually split the checks.

The drinks were incredible and would make any mixologist proud. Very interesting yet high quality ingredients were used to make delicious  cocktails.

Since they knew we were sharing our food, they divided the entree to 2 dishes. Wow! That's service. Scallops were cooked to perfection. Very tasty and I wanted more!  We got the Bernie's Mac 'n Cheese and was also really good.  So CPH is known for the house cocktails. We HAD to order. Midwest Manhattan and the Sangria are amazing. If you like a good manhattan, go for this one!  As for dessert, we shared the blueberry pie with graham cracker ice cream!!! I LOVED it!  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with CPH.

While in Scottsdale for a meeting last week, I was tasked to find a great place for dinner and this place was recommended.  When we first arrived, I immediately liked the vibe and trendy look of the place.  Dim lights and their cool interior created just the right casual elegant atmosphere that I love. When we arrived, our party of 11 were seated quickly in a semi private area alongside the dining room that was perfect.  All cocktails and food were excellent and exceptional which is important for any 5 star rating.  But what solidified 5 stars for me was our stellar waiter Sam.  Talk about exceptional service and someone who so naturally has mastered the concept of connecting with customers.  He was funny, sociable,  enthusiastic and addressed me by name.  He flawlessly handled our party's cocktail demands without a hitch.  We went through quite a few rounds but he was on point and attentively got our cocktails ordered and served with such efficiency.  He then suggested we leave the ordering to him, where he would help decide on the best appetizers, mains and desserts to serve our party.  He nailed it.  We all absolutely loved the fondue, burrata, chopped salad (extremely tasty!), seared tuna, rack of lamb, scallops, shortribs and chocolate and caramel desserts that were just too luscious to describe.  We literally just sat back, relaxed and enjoyed an exceptional meal and service.  Bravo Citizen Public House, for standout food, service and such a star waiter like Sam!",

My waiter was awesome, energetic, and fully detailed each course on the menu. I would probably come back for the service more than the food itself.   Sausage of the Day Very tasty and something I would eat on a cold day. Would be be something I order again? Maybe, I would prefer to see what else Citizen's has to offer.   Crab Cakes Something I would not order again. Bland, and it tasted ok. Usually Crab cakes wow me. This was like something to fill me up. The waiter did a good job at putting this one in the middle because if this came at the end, I would have been disappointed.   Chopped Salad This dish saved my food experience at Citizen's. The chopped salad is very comparable to Wildflower's salad. The only exception is that here they add raw tuna. From the the couscous, sunflower seeds, dried corn, it's almost identical. I ate at WIldflower the day after and noticed that the difference was the dressing, Alaskan salmon, feta cheese, cranberries, and adds diced red peppers. The only difference is that this chopped salad porportion is smaller and cost more. I must say it was a nice touch with the raw tuna, good quality!",

I love that it was mixed table side and my favorite component was strangely the freeze dried corn, very creative! All ingredients went together perfectly. I am not normally a smoked salmon fan either but it all just worked. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable not only about the menu but also wine. Entrees left a bit to be desired...I got the seabass, it was 2 thin filets with skin on. I have always had my seabass as a thick filet and this preparation just didn't do it for me. We did get a bag of their pecan bacon brittle to go and it is delicious, not overly sweet and a bit smokey from the bacon which was nice. The brittle is a great gift and a nice local item. If I lived in Scottsdale I would swing by for a lunch of chopped salad but didn't have strong feelings about return for dinner entrees.",

Some say that this is the next Food Mecca of America. I disagree TOTALLY. I had a chance to try three dishes:  Truffle Grilled Cheese-Tasted like slightly cheesy potato on bread Lamb Burger- No flavor. The kennebec fries tasted odd, but went well with maple syrup. Piggy & Waffle- I think this was the best dish out of the three, but it was just ok. At least the pork was moist.  Overall, I think this place just tries too hard.  2/5 Might come back to try the chopped salad.",

I sat at the bar and ordered the grilled peach salad and the hangar steak.   The peaches were tasteless and rock hard (although perfect grill marks) and although it was not over dressed, the vinegar just took over because there just wasn't enough flavors on the plate. Even the bacaon lardon crips were 'eh' and I love pork.   The hangar steak was so-so. But maybe this is my fault. Hangar steak is a great cut of meat if done right and personally, i think the only way to do Hangar is sous-vide that thing for a long slow bath. Otherwise, you don't break down the tough pars and the center is under cooked.   They slapped some asparagus on top, heaped a bunch of chipolini onions on the side and went light on the sauce.   There is good potential here and I probably ordered way wrong. I'll give it another try next time i'm in town but I was not overly impressed based on the many stellar reviews.",

It wasn't bad, but just didn't meet the mark.   Pork belly pastrami appetizer - This was good, but the ratios were a bit off.   Rack of lamb - Lamb itself was cooked to the right temperature, a simple preparation. The flavoring of the dish was light and the sherry reduction a bit thin...Leading to a dish that was good, yet underwhelming.   Rib eye steak - Meat was over cooked and not to our liking, so this dish was sent back. (It was served with a Serrano mushroom compote, which was quite interesting and tasty.)  Mac n cheese - This was good, had some interesting sweetness to it. Would be a good dish to order for the table alongside entrees.   Pork cheeks - Good appetizer, flavors were an interesting, compliment.   While nothing was necessarily bad, the food wasn't good enough to return to this restaurant in the future. While we may be quite spoiled with the LA food options, this place was unmemorable and underwhelming.",

They are never overcooked, and the grits they are served on are delicious as well.  The prices are a little steep, but I will say that the quality of the food and the cocktails is very high.  Also, the serving staff is AMAZING and always very friendly.  Also, you can make a reservation through OpenTable, which is always quite handy.  I take out-of-town guests to CPH, and they have all really loved it.  Again, if the prices were a little lower and if the menu had just a few more choices, I would have given it 5 stars.",

Our waiter, Gary, was AMAZING... and I don't use that word frivolously! He was friendly, fun, outgoing and totally made our visit exceptional. Note to other waitstaff - THIS is how you earn a big tip! The offerings on the menu all looked so good so we asked Gary for his recommendations for both our drinks and between a few of the entrees. He was very knowledgable about everything and went into detail about our options, asking us what we liked and making suggestions accordingly. Even though he was obviously very busy, he took the time with us to make sure we got what we were going to love. He even offered to get us new drinks if we didn't like what we ordered.  Anyway, for food we ordered the meatloaf and side of mac n' cheese to split between my friend and I... per his suggestion that it would be a lot of food. They even split it on two plates for us and it was more than enough food... and I'm a pretty good eater! The meatloaf was absolutely awesome! I really liked the mac n' cheese too but my friend didn't love that it had a kind of spicy salsa topping - but that could be easily omitted.   Sadly, we were too full (even after splitting an entree!) to order dessert! So bummed we missed out on this since everything looked so good. But we were going out dancing and didn't want to be stuffed.  Can't wait to go back when I'm in Scottsdale again! Thanks Gary and the rest of the nice staff!",

The Chopped Salad lived up to its hype. Ingredients were so fresh and flavorful. Unique presentation given that the server mixes everything at the table. One of the best salads I've had in a long time. I'm typically a wine drinker but followed the bar tenders recs for tasting a cocktail off the barrel aged list. The Americano was perfect, and I learned it was the drink that James Bond originally drank ;) such a home run night!",

    "text": "Let's talk about a really good dining experience that was brought down by a HORRIBLE HOSTESS. We were in the area after some shopping at the mall close by and decided to check out this restaurant after doing some research on Yelp. We arrived around 8:15pm and requested a table for 3. The asian hostess, Stacey, snubbed us and told us that there was a 2 hour wait. We did not really have a problem with that since it was a Saturday night and the restaurant appeared busy. However, I decided to hop on Open Table to see if there were any reservations available. Low and behold, there was an 8:45, 9:00, 9:15... reservation for 3 available. We decided to reserve the 8:45pm reservation and hang out til our time was up....  We returned to the restaurant at 8:45pm and let the hostess know that we had a reservation. Again, SNUBBED BY STACEY and surprise, there was a table available for us! We were shocked at how she did not seem to care that she told us that there was a 2 hour wait when we were able to reserve a table for 30 minutes later...  Beyond the horrible waitress, I would rate this restaurant 4 stars.  Our waiter AJ was amazing. He should get 5+ stars He was friendly, had great recommendations and was very attentive to our needs. Everyone that served us was friendly and super attentive!  The food was 4 stars. We enjoyed the following items: - The Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn -- This was probably the most disappointing dish we had. There were hints of bacon fat but it needed some kind of kick like an herb to make it pop? - The Original Chopped Salad -- Apparently it has it's own Facebook page. It's definitely worth the hype! It's similar to a tea salad at a burmese restaurant in the way it is presented. - Buttermilk Chicken -- The chicken was juicy throughout. - Pork Osso Buco -- Fall off the bone good. - Pan Seared Scallops -- Recommended by our waiter and was delicious!   Overall, I would've rated this place 4 stars had it not been for our horrible hostess situation... so it's gets bumped down to 3 stars. To add insult to injury, I also want to add that I just received an email from Open Table stating that I \"No Showed\" for our reservation. I guess Stacey once again reiterated how much she didn't want us there...",

That's not the name of it, but I happened to be dining with two expecting mothers in my group. As the only other non-drinker, I was happy to sip water. However, when these ladies got their fruited drinks and saw my simple H20 they took it upon themselves to ensure I joined the fruited party. They order the \"pregnant lady drink\" for me. Seeing the opportunity, the restaurant did it up right and packed more fruit and garnish in that drink than in most grocer's produce section. Well played.  I lied--the meatloaf also stood out, the scallops were outstanding, and I had a steak. I rarely order a stake, but when I do I order it rare. So tender. So simple, but with a nice, rich sauce to accompany the beef.  Honestly, the evening is a blur. The server handled our big, rowdy crowd with aplomb and grace and deserves a huge pat on the back for the effort. They showed us a tremendous time. The space is gorgeous, happy, and legitimately serving up some fantastic dishes.",

    "text": "We came back for dinner on Friday evening and it was everything I hoped it would be.   If you're an alcoholic...err... \"alcohol aficionado\", this is the place for you.  They offer barrel aged cocktails which is a truly unique experience.  They're a bit spendy at regular price but if you go during \"Social Hour\", they're half price and a steal (note to CPH: I appreciate not being forced to be happy.  Thanks for validating the preferences of pissy people everywhere.)  The term \"craft cocktails\" is starting to go the way of  sun-dried tomatoes (sad and overused), but currently there isn't a better description and this is definitely a destination for a twist on the sauce.  If my husband were granted full access to their bar and nifty ingredients, I might never see him again.  (But granted, it's been a good run.)    We ordered the mac n' cheese, chicken and waffle, and crab cakes for appetizers.  All were fantastic.  I thought the chicken and waffle was a strange offering but an app but it works.  For din-din, our table had the short ribs, filet, duck, and meatloaf.  Six loud tipsy people were quiet for maybe an entire minute which should tell you something.  Desserts were an exercise in competitive eating but we managed.  Our table had the pumpkin bread pudding, apple pie and dream pudding.  YUM.  We then accomplished a gastronomic feat by indulging in their house-made egg nog.  It was a thick, creamy, delicious glass of shame.        The service was fantastic.  Our waiter was friendly, funny and engaging.  They did a wonderful job of taking care of us without hovering.    I'm not the biggest fan of Old Town thanks to the douche bag/Ax factor but this is definitely a compelling reason to make my way through guys in too tight t-shirts who say \"dude\" excessively.",

My own fault. The Gio Osso Burger is the best burger in the valley I think.  The peppercorn filet mignon is super tender and mine was cooked exactly to spec for the medium rare I ordered. The fair trade short ribs are terrific and tender but a bit on the small side if you are a big eater.   The best dessert in my opinion is the Black and Tan. The push pop is just okay, more something to laugh about than thoroughly enjoy, but ymmv. The apple crisp is tasty but could use more apple frankly.  My big complaint about Citizen Pub House would have to be the noise. Put up some acoustic panels or tile please so diners can converse without shouting across the table!",

Highly recommend walking through Old Town to get a feel for the area, though of course the weather might dissuade you.   Sat at the bar.  Had two Manhattans, olives, and the Scallops.  The bartenders were professional, courteous, and very friendly.  Even gave me a slight discount because I changed seats so another party could all sit together.  Little things like that really make me advocate for a restaurant.  Beyond that, the food was wonderful.  You can tell a lot of thought and passion went into their menu selections, and I was happy to partake in the offerings listed above.  I'll definitely visit again the next time I'm in town.",

The earliest we could get a same day reservation was 8:45 PM, so we had drinks and appetizers elsewhere. Upon arriving 15 minutes early for our reservation, we were promptly seated. We enjoyed the cocktails. We shared the OMFG chopped salad, which was just as advertised! Such a unique mix of flavors and textures - I really enjoyed this dish. The server explained that this is a signature dish at all restaurants by the same owner, which was neat.   Because we already had appetizers beforehand, I opted for a second appetizer as my main course. The yellowfin crudo was absolutely delicious. Very fresh and crisp tasting. My husband really enjoyed the short ribs - the meat was melt-in-your-mouth.  Service was good. The server was definitely busy and apologized several times for our wait, which was fairly minimal. The bill was certainly high, but on par with what you would expect given quality of food and atmosphere. The one knock I would say was that the restaurant was somewhat dark and loud.  Would definitely recommend!",

    "text": "I really struggled with what to rate CPH and contemplated over a few days......Yep, I care about my fellow yelpers that much. So as for my dining experience, it was very disappointing. I selected CPH not just for an early dinner, but to take my wife out for her birthday. Upon arrival, CPH was very quiet and only two other tables were occupied. With that said, you would think we would have been provided with a somewhat intimate birthday dinning experience...ummmmm, not so much.  We were taken over and plopped right next to the other two tables. The whole place was empty and we were placed there?!?! Really?! My only thought was staff were trying to save our waiter steps. Anyhow, we rolled with it.  For dinner, I noticed we caught happy hour and we decided to try their olives and cheese fondue that came with bread, sausage, and pear. The cheese fondue was good and the sausage was tasty. I was also pleasantly surprised how well the pear paired :) with the cheese. For dinner we decided to try out their signature original salad, the meatloaf, and the short rib. I forgot to mention our daughter came with, so don't be thinking we killed all the food alone. The salad was good, not five stars good in my opinion but good. Was glad my wife enjoyed it. The meatloaf was okay but not amazing. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes that came with the dish. As for the short rib, it was awesome. I loved the sauce that came with the dish. Unfortunately, the parsnip puree that came with the dish was not good, but I would definitely recommend the dish and ask for mashed potatoes as the side. Just my thoughts.   Now as our dinner experience was coming to an end and aside from where we were seated the night was decent. The food was pretty good, not Top Chef kind of good, but fine. So for dessert, I assumed there would be some sort of acknowledgment of my wife's special day. When I scheduled our reservation, I informed staff of the reason for the visit. I also confirmed upon arrival that we were early for our birthday reservation. So as you can guess, she got nothing. No happy birthday, no little treat, nothing, nada.  Our waitress just quickly laid dessert menus in front of each of us and waited for our thoughts. At this point I am thinking maybe they will do up the dessert we choose and so after review of the menu we ask for the push pop dessert. So after a minute or two, out comes the push pop as plain as can be. No happy birthday, nothing. To top it off, the dessert was clearly not designed for three people. I take part of the blame as I thought the components of the dish would be functional for more than one mouth but at the same time, staff could have spoken up and offered their thoughts since they have seen the dish before. The icing on the cake for the cake she did not get was as we were getting up to leave, I noticed the table two over was provided with a little cake and candle. Good to see it does exist.  Anyhow, overall we left disappointed.  I expect a certain level of perfection when you are going to spend the cash CPH asks for. I have no issues paying the price, but just did not get what I was hoping for for my wife. I felt very sorry her night did not go as I planned. Bummer.",

It wasn't too crowded, but we wanted to keep it casual and sat at the bar. Our friendly bartender came over and went through the menu with us. He spoke with such enthusiasm and passion for the food. We decided to go along with all his recommendations.  Appetizer: The Original Chopped Salad: By the name, chopped salad sounds like rabbit food, but our server warned us that we would soon be chopped salad addicts. He was absolutely right! WOW! It was one of the best salads we had ever eaten!! The separated ingredients were beautifully presented to us on a platter and then mixed together with a delicious dressing. Smoked salmon, couscous, dried corn, diced tomato, trail mix, arugula, creamy dressing-the perfectly articulated combination. The texture and flavors were really incredible and we all fought for the last few bites. I would come back just for the salad alone! I found out later that this particular salad has its own Facebook page: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTheOriginalChoppedSalad&s=16ef6ac7030348b87319fc9328d098a9ffe8e99a4c6237dddf0a23c2dd366d89\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">facebook.com/TheOriginal...</a>  Crab cakes: Scrumptious and served with unique crunchy cole slaw. There was a decent amount of lump crab in the cakes for being in Arizona and not near the ocean.   Entree: Duck burger with duck fat fries, how meta! The duck burger was mouth-watering with shishito aioli, fried egg, tomato, spinach, and potato bun. Juicy and incredibly flavorful.   Short ribs: We were drawn to the dish because of the local coffee rub. The meat was super tender.   Dessert: The Dude Jar: Intrigued by the name, we tried out this dessert. Basically it tasted like pudding with some crunchy cookies.   Anyway, back to the main star of this meal- the chopped salad! You must try this dish! So thankful that our server made this recommendation. Absolutely superb service and food! What a fantastic way to start the new year!",

The staff was very friendly - from the moment we walked in - and the food was pretty good.    The reason I didn't rate it higher is because the Filet Mignon AsadaTacos that my husband ordered were \"street\" size, which is fine but not for $16.  It should've been listed as an appetizer/small plate instead of on the entree side of the menu, or add that they're street tacos to the description.  Also, the filet was not very tender and a little chewy at times - seemed like it might have been a different cut of meat.  My husband was still hungry when we left.  However, I ordered the Green Chile Burger and loved every bite!  It was big and juicy - I ordered it medium and it actually came out that way!  The roasted corn salsa and Anaheim Green chile sauce - AMAZING!  I couldn't finish all of the fries that came with it and only ate half the bun (trying to keep it somewhat healthy... too late, lol).    Tip: Split an appetizer and an entree for a more budget-friendly experience.",

I had the beef ribs and while they were delicious the sides were not the best- we had an appetizer of the bacon popcorn which was amazing and I highly recommend it. One of my dinner mates got an amazing drink called Instant gratification with a 12 year old McCallan. Would probably go back for appetizers and cocktails. It's a bit loud in there and the decor is nice. The staff were all very kind and on the ball.",

I had heard great things about this joint (specifically the salad) and had the opportunity to visit with some colleagues. Reservations were made for a 6pm visit and for a group of 6 we had a really good table with a nice view of the restaurant. Service was excellent throughout the meal and the staff is genuinely good at what they do. The bar has a diverse selection of booze, not so much for beer. The menu offerings are somewhat limited but that was not an issue for me. As a group we had started with the heirloom pig fat popcorn, Noble bread plate, and fondu; all were extremely complex and packed with flavor - seriously...go for the popcorn. The main entree I ordered was he filet at medium well. It was cooked perfect, had a nice buttery texture, and the flavor was very nuanced. The accompanying items on the main dish were really good, too. The purple sweet potato had a creaminess to it that complimented the flavors of the meat nicely. Interior architecture is fantastic. Good place to people watch just be aware of the parking situation.",

My husband, friend and 4-year old daughter went to CPH on August 30th for dinner.   We were quickly sat and that's where our incredible experience began. Gina was our server and because of her excellent service, our entire meal and experience was one of the best I've ever had.   She knew exactly when to step into our table, to refill drinks, to take plates. She timed everything perfectly and never asked us if we needed anything, she just noticed and was proactive. She was kind and accommodating to our daughter, which was a nice touch!  My husband and I have talked about our dinner at CPH now the last couple of weeks and how memorable it was. The atmosphere was sexy, the food was incredible and the service was the best we've ever had.   Thank you  to CPH and to all of your staff for making our dinner one to remember! We will be back and will recommend CPH to all of our friends and family in the Phoenix area!",

When I ordered the flatbread, I was expecting a flatbread pizza but thought the bread and hummus were good. We then the beet salad and the chopped salad. We ordered the chopped salad based on previous reviews but we found it to be bland. The beet salad, on the other hand, was great. The touch of honey was perfect! We next both had the scallop. The scallop was ok but the sides were amazing! The sides really make the dish. We had the cobbler dessert which was not great. The sauce was cooked into the fruit enough. The service, I thought, was not very basic and slow.   Bottom line...this place is good for happy hour but for dinner the food quality overall is mediocre besides the beet salad which was great!!   Pros Location  Ambience  Happy hour drinks and food options  Beet salad   Cons  Chopped salad was bland  Service was slow and not that friendly",

My hubby had a burger (forgot the name) and it was good. We also ordered popcorn with bacon (yeah, right?!) for appetizer. Two of my hubby's favorite combined. Even though I don't like popcorn but I still ate quite a bit. I also wanted to point out that not until midnight that night I realized I might lost both of our sunglasses there. But since they don't open till next day 4pm and we were back in Vegas already. I called and asked if they can mail the glasses to me and I would pay for the shipping. The lady who answered said she would ask manager. Within a few days, I received them nicely packed in the mail. So thank you very much for your great food and great customer service!",

You get smokiness from the salmon, leafiness from the arugula, chewiness from the couscous, and crunch from the dried corn and currants. The dressing did not dominate the salad and allowed you to taste every flavor. It was simply a perfect salad.",

We had a special request to alter the food to exclude wheat products for my husband and they really went above and beyond to make sure he didn't accidentally have any in his order. They were so good with our kiddos and made our meal very enjoyable.  The food: you must try the chopped salad.. it's very unique and delicious. The scallops were fantastic.. we subbed the grits for mashed potatoes and it was still great. The burrata was good.. we had to remove the pesto since it had breadcrumbs but I'm sure in its original form it would have been amazing. The kids had grilled cheese and buttered noodles which were a hit. The drinks are great! Honestly it's a must try in the area.",

The bacon-fat popcorn kicked off the night (Greasy and totally bad for you but totally the bomb). The deconstructed pork belly pastrami was out of this world, their famous original chop salad w orzo was so delightful, the burrata with romanesco cauliflower and yellowfin tuna w smoked tomato water - both spectacular.  Service was swift and wine list n cocktails were also notable.  Try to snag an outdoor seat to catch the action in old town.  If CPH was its own country- id definitely be a citizen! I'll be back.

A nice corner table in the back that was semi-private and great for people watching.  Even though you can show up in Jeans and/or shorts the Citizen is definitely upscale. Linen table cloths, excellent service, and wonderfully strong craft cocktails and of course a strong menu gives these guys an easy 4.5 stars.  Plus 1 ordered a Ketel One Martini with blue cheese olives. Her quote \"This is as good as the ones you make at home\". I went big with The Beast: Herradura silver tequila, Ancho Reyes chile liqueur, Averna Limoni, Aztec chocolate bitters. This is a one and done cocktail especially if you already had a robust HH and are planning to barhop post dinner. I would gravitate toward this craft cocktail on my next visit.  Appetizer was Chilean Crab Cakes: roasted corn salad, Oaxacan chile remoulade, micro cilantro 20. What, you thought they were your standard Krab cakes thing again as nothing is standard here. The two cakes are easily shared and ours were cooked perfectly just a tad crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside.  My main course was their gypsy pork shank. According to our waiter this dish is adapted from the chef's Hungarian family recipe. It was fall off the bone tender and I did not want my meal to end. Plus 1 stated that her smart chicken entree was not that smart. Surely not a bust but she said she was expecting more flavor. Now the Brussel sprouts were another story. Perfectly cooked and seasoned.   Throughout the meal our waiter made sure we were well taken cared of and we never lacked for water or attention. I read that their HH is a great deal so that's on the short list for a return visit.",

I've enjoyed the Original Chopped Salad under a different moniker for years at Cowboy Ciao, so we decided to go with the Mirilton Chopped Salad: greens, tomato, popcorn, halloumi cheese, cucumbers and onions. The haloumi cheese was a unique treat, though overall it didn't really compare to the OCS.  We ordered the Pork Belly Pastrami starter, which was kind of a deconstructed reuben over spaetzle- it was almost perfect and the pork belly just melted in my mouth. The sea scallops were also heavenly, seared just so and served with buttery corn grits and a vinegary gastrique. We capped it all of with a pot de creme: super rich and just right for sharing.  We also enjoyed some red wine from Merkin (yes, THAT Merkin), the Maynard James Keenen winemaking venture- kind of neato, I haven't seen it in a restaurant before (watch \"Blood into Wine\" if you're lost).  I think this place has a little something for everyone, and for someone like me, it has it all. Its food is artful without being fussy, and the ambiance is cool without trying too hard.",

    "text": "I'm gonna file this one under Summer Is The Low Season In Scottsdale.  Nice decor, but as far from the look of a Public House as The W is from a quaint B&B. Came in for a drink and apps.  The chopped salad was tasty. Weirdly it came with smoked salmon and my wife hates smoked salmon.  We didn't know this when ordering because the description on the menu was just a URL to a Facebook page(!). I guess the salad has its own page that we should have consulted.  I had the mac n cheese which was named after somebody so I figured it had to be good, but it was just regular mac n cheese with salsa on top.  No Bueno.  The kicker was that my wife's Manhattan cocktail arrived within 15 seconds of ordering it!  Sounds good but when we asked how it could be that they whipped up a craft cocktail so speedily the barman told us it was for an earlier customer who didn't want it.  And was warm.  As least he took it off the bill--when asked to.",

Had reservations with my husband for our wedding anniversary and from the beginning we had a change of heart about the place. From being handed black napkins so that we would not get lint on our clothing, to the bread service (neither of which happened on previous visits) everything was outstanding! Our server Gary was prompt, friendly, knowledgeable, and made us feel very welcome.  I again had the Filet, which of course was AMAZING. We tried the Mac N Cheese but it really wasn't all that impressive.  I really cant wait to eat there again, and bringing more of our foodie friends with us! Thank you CPH crew for making me see why this place gets 5 stars!",

My favorite so far is the Scallops but the meatloaf is great too as is the filet.  The Chopped salad is a must have!!  And they make kick ass drinks here.   The only thing keeping me from giving this place 5 stars is the overly attentive service.  The service can make of break a restaurant and the service here is good, but on two different occasions while I was dining here the servers kept interrupting to ask if we needed anything.  I was enjoying my company and conversation and both times had to let the server know to back off a bit.  And they didn't.  I appreciate attentiveness but this was too much.  I'd appreciate a little presence and intuitiveness over the constant tending to.   I won't let the minor complaint keep me away from this delicious food.",

    "text": "Made an 8:15 reservation on Yelp for a late Vday dinner with the Mrs. last Friday. Wanted to check out Cowboy Cio, but then saw the reviews about CPH and decided to give it a try.   Got there at 8pm and was greeted with a smile. Our table was still at 8:15, but the hostess said we could hang at the bar or the stinky patio. Had quick service for a glass of Pinot and Tanqueray and tonic ($20 without tip). OK pour.   Short wait and we were whisked away to a table for 2. Was greeted by Clark who quickly got us more drinks and asked if we had any questions. Good guy, very helpful and honest about his choices. We switched gears to a Lagunitas IPA ($5) and sangria ($8), which was served nicely.   Read about the Pork bellly Pastrami app and the Citizen Chop Salad, so we ordered both. Clark hooked it up so we could have each in courses per say. Pork belly was awesome! C'mon - rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut = goodness. Citizen Chopped - chayote, snow pea greens, grape tomato, heirloom popcorn, grilled halloumi cheese, cucumber-onion salad & parsley-garlic dressing! Very unique tastes and refreshing. Would like to have that salad in the summer for sure!  Main courses - The Mrs. had the Short Ribs ($28) and I ordered the Meatloaf... yeah, I know... I was hoping for something epic in meatloaf, but it was good. Nuthin special. The Short ribs on the other hand were EPIC! It is served with this dried cherry bbq sauce that you would not hesitate to lick the small bowl dry! The short rib had a dark right out the BBQ pit look. It was AWESOME! Comes with roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg.   Dessert - \"DONUTS & COFFEE\" ($10) - Bourbon glazed donut bread pudding, vanilla sauce, cafe au lait ice cream, brown sugar streusel... + More AWESOME! If you go, get it!   Overall, A good experience. I want to give it 3.5 stars. Service was prompt, Food was good, but it was the surprises in the ingredients that made it fun. Good mix of people too. The price is a little high by a few bucks for items in my opinion. I mean a $20 meatloaf should have been effin epic - Right?!",

He was prompt, gave great suggestions and added to an overall positive experience. Now onto the food, for an appetizer we got the crab cakes, we both enjoyed the flavor but agreed that for the price the portion was a bit small. For dinner I got the scallops and my fiance got the meatloaf. They scallops were very flavorful and cooked to perfection. The meatloaf was very juicy, and had great layers of flavor. Dessert was so-so, we got the peanut butter pudding cup thingy, all the flavors were good I just don't think it catered to my taste. But overall everything was good and we really enjoyed our experience .",

It is a little tricky to find as the entry faces East so you access the front door from Craftsman Ct instead of 5th Ave. But the experience is worth the hunt for the door. What can I say?

It was a set menu, I chose the chia tuna as my 1st and my Husband (JB) had the chop, both were amazing! I LOVED the chop!  JB loved the tuna! My second was the scallops, and it was up there as one of the best plates I have had. JB had the filet and it was good, but not amazing.  I noticed it had that same sauce as the meatloaf from when I was first here. I just don't think the taste is fitting to the dish.  Then dessert, the caramel sauce made the red velvet perfect and the flourless chocolate cake was so great! I think the texture made it the best!! Beyond rich! Soooo good! I look forward to another visit for sure! Maybe happy hour, I love a budget gourmet feast, the $170 tab for tonight was a little much, but very much worth it. It was the perfect way to end our romantic day!  Side note ... Thank you/sorry (what ever fits) to the fellow diners that had the deal with our loving affectionate way of dining... The feeding each other and kissing constantly is how we roll... :P  I love you SBM!! Thank you for an amazing Valentine's day!!!",

From the very beginning we noticed how consistently attentive and friendly the staff was. Over the top! Once we got to our patio table, we were greeted by our waiter, Sam. Sam had a way of talking and presenting the food we ordered that made everything feel like we were in for such an amazing treat... and he was right. We ordered the chopped salad to share. It was the best we've ever had! We were in the middle of trying to figure out how it was made (so we could try to make it) when Sam came back to see how we liked it. We told him what we were doing and he helped us! Then he said, \"Ill be right back with a surprise.\" When he returned he had a printed recipe card for the chopped salad which he gave to us. Who does that?! I could go on and on about the details for the rest of the evening, but they all played out just like it started... AMAZING. Thanks for the great food and great memories. Even though this is a 5 hour drive for us, Citizen Public House is one of the main reasons we will go back to Scottsdale. Soon!",

Got there, really cool granite counter for the host stand.  We were greeted by smiles and shown to a table behind the bar.  The atmosphere is really cool, dimly lit.  Gina was our server and she was fantastic.  We ordered a bottle of \"The Boxer\" and it was fantastic.  Gina knew her wine and really seemed to enjoy talking with us about different vineyards.  She even brought out samples of another wine similar to what we were drinking so we could see the difference in color.  Now that is really great service, so great, we opened another bottle.    The food was fantastic, very well prepared and came out with great timing.    Gina's brother, Richie, is the Mixologist-Partner here and he came out to the table to talk wine with us as well.  We ended up all exchanging info and talking about a few hard to find bottles.    AMAZING service here and the food is great.  Ask for Gina if you come in, some of the best hospitality I've ever had.",

Food: For starters we split The Original Chopped Salad. We weren't aware that it has Salmon mixed in it...and I cannot stand salmon...so I barely had it. My wife liked it though. Entrees - TRUFFLE GRILLED CHEESE (white truffle scented mashed potato, Emmental, melted onion, French bread, simple field greens) which was very oily and buttery. The bread was a little soggy and not toasted enough. FAIR TRADE SHORT RIBS (coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce,roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg) did the job for my wife but I thought it was ok.  Dessert -  PEANUT BUTTER STRATA BAR (white chocolate ice cream, strawberry jam, peanut butter crunch) was eh. PB was flaky not creamy.  Atmosphere - Loud and modern.  Service - Good, no complaints. The hostess did hook us up with a seat without having a reservation. We tugged on her heartstrings.  Prices - Expensive. I am all for paying for a great meal but if you add a couple of drinks your dropping bucks here.  I do admit if you want to go for a drink and be noticed, this a good place to go.

    "text": "Let me start my saying that we had fantastic service at Citizen Public House.   I was not impressed with the atmosphere. The famous Chopped Salad was probably one of, if not the best salads I have ever had.  My friend had the Seabass and it was not a thick filet like we are accustomed to, instead it was two very thin dry pieces with a strange tasting sauce.  I had the short ribs which were flavorful, but inconsistently cooked and the parsnip puree and greens again had a strange taste. At the price point, I would have expected more.",

All of the food that should be was HOT which means it was delivered immediately upon completion.  I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu options!",

Serving largely as a gastropub, of sorts, and with a menu laden with all sort of upscaled American comfort food it really was not WHAT Citizen Public House is doing that would end up wowing, but rather how well they do it.  Greeted and seated at a table near the window where our server, Clark, would stop by frequently throughout the evening to make sure we were never for want of anything, menus were present on arrival and with little effort we both honed in on appetizers, mains, and desserts that fit our palates perfectly - honestly, I don't know if I have ever seen a rather short menu put together so many things I like in a trio of plates - and when these plates arrived each were as good as they read.  More or less a collection of small plates featuring big flavors the meal began with soft pita and grassy olive oil before moving into spiral pasta thick with cheese and balanced with bright tomatoes alongside crispy chicken over a toothsome waffle that could have easily fit the role of breakfast or dessert as well as an appetizer.  Next up, a plate of tender and rosy duck given texture not by crisp skin but rather crunchy pistachios and millet nearly the texture of mashed potatoes tinged with rosemary and bitter greens.  Not to be outdone, my mother's meatloaf was rich and artistically plated; a classic texture made unique with rich herbal/earthy notes to balance the briny demi-glace and pork.  Heading to the home stretch and opting to outsource sweets to Tracey Dempsey, a wise move made by many local kitchens, I think I can confidently say that what landed before me was good but what was presented to my mother is a dish she still talks about today - a layer-by-layer temporal change in texture and flavor that was not quite a budino or a pot de creme, nor a parfait - just a decadent sweet-meets-salty amalgam that was truly amongst the ten best desserts I enjoyed in 2012; a reason in and of itself to visit Citizen Public House...amongst many others.",

Fondue was typical but good. Mac n cheese was also decent but nothing special. The same cheese in the fondue is used in the Mac and cheese. The meatloaf was the best part. It was cooked well and very juicy. The zucchini on the side competed the plate nicely. Got the Black and Tan for dessert and surprisingly did not like it. A decent place but nothing extraordinary. It's sister restaurant The Gladly is much better but pricier.",

Last night was our 2 month anniversary (insert your sarcasm here) and chose to revisit CPH. I made an online reservation and stated in the notes the info about our anniversary and if they could do something special. Who knew they actually read those things.   Although we had a reservation we had to wait 15 for a table to open up. The place was packed. No biggie. We saddled up to the bar for some drinks. My girlfriend wanted to start drinking bourbon. I asked if they had an obscure brand that was a mellow starting point as far as bourbons go and they did. Every 5 minutes a different host came up to us to let us know our status and that we would be seated shortly. And we were. The manager came over and wished us a happy anniversary. Much appreciated.   When we were seated the server brought us a little gift which was amazing and a great surprise.   The food was amazing and so was our server. The entire staff was friendly, attentive, gracious, funny and welcoming. On the way out I thanked the manager and let him know we'll be back each month to celebrate our first date there. What a great and unexpected experience. More restaurants should take a queue from CPH on how to treat customers. Thanks for making our special night yet another night to remember.",

Apps: Pork Belly was sublime with perfect meat and memorable flavors.  Tracy's chopped salad earned a smile at first bite.  Our little girl liked the mac & cheese.  Had the ribs for our dinners.  BEST.  RIBS.  EVER.  The cherry-based BBQ sauce was grin-worthy.  Greens were cooked perfectly and the mashed yams/potatoes combined perfectly.  And the bread pudding was loved by all.  The staff fit us in even though we didn't have a reservation.  I think they were kind to us since we had a baby in tow.  The front staff made faces and cooed at her.  Kat took care of us and earned her 25% tip.  Orders were fast; apps hit quickly followed shortly by entrees once the first plates were cleared; drinks never went more than half empty; and she was our 5-year old hit it off.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying we were pretty excited to try this place, especially since a few of us even had this bookmarked on yelp...   But damn this place is dissappointing.    A bunch of us are in town for Spring Training and tried to hit up Citizen Public House.  The place wasn't too packed... more open tables than filled tables.   We showed up at around 10:30 on Saturday night walked up to the hostess and told her we had a party of seven.  She confidently told us \"Sure, just a few moments\", looked us all up and down then walked away into the back.   A couple minutes later, she comes back and says \"Sorry, we can't seat 7 people right now.\"  ......  Seriously???  WTF?!?!?!  We asked about all the empty tables and she said we can't sit there.  I'm assuming they didn't want to seat us because we were slightly dressed down (even though attire shows 'casual') or because we weren't a group of the standard middle aged white dudes in button shirts, jeans and dress shoes.  whatever the case is, it came off as a kind of pompous place with a hostess (or manager) who looks down on people.  You guys missed out on a few hundred dollars plus a big tip from us.... not that you care though.  ***this review is soley based on service since we never got the chance to eat here***",

    "text": "Came here for Restaurant Week as the reviews for this place seemed pretty stellar.  First things first, outstanding service (almost alarmingly so).  Our server Gary took great pains to ensure the four of us had a good experience and were taken care of.  Props to Gary for going the extra mile for us.    Now to the food.  Again, went with the restaurant week menu for this visit.  For the appetizer I of course went with the chopped salad.  As expected it was outstanding.  Great presentation, tons of tasty ingredients, and just the right portion.  I think the chopped salad at Cowboy Ciao might be a little better, but just barely.  For the main course I went with the scallops that were covered with greens, tiny pieces of bacon, and doused in a cream corn sauce.  Great dish.  Portion was healthy but not over top.  I had a piece of the buttermilk chicken dish from my girlfriend's plate and that was also good.  For dessert I had the caramel bread pudding.  Portion was fairly small, but tasted good and when all was said and done I didn't feel uncomfortably full.  The reason I dock one point wasn't the food or the service, but the noise.  I literally had to yell across the table for everyone to hear me.  The acoustics are such that even the smallest noise bounces everywhere.  Probably wouldn't be a big deal if I were just hanging out at the bar, but I didn't think the sounds would be so overpowering in a sit down restaurant.  Overall though, cool place and great food.  Just make sure your vocal chords are adequately prepared.",

It is served on focacia bread with fries and pickled veggies. Someone got the chicken which was also highly rated, but it really didn't taste that good. It tasted rubbery and bland to me even though there was truffle oil on it. The highly rate chopped salad was good too although not very filling. The prices were okay. I will be going back.

Though I just realized that every time we've gone we've been seated at the wall half booth tables, which I guess is kinda annoying. The waiters are friendly though can be a tad too chatty, practicing for their reality show auditions. Also, if you order meat or a burger, the kitchen has a firing problem. Your food will be over cooked. Order a medium lamb burger and it will be well done. That's not that big a deal, though their lamb burger is not good at all. It and the fries taste like cardboard, so over cooking doesn't help. But an over cooked steak is a tragedy. So if you want it one way, order it rarer. Must be a timing issue in the kitchen. We've been 4 times, and this has happened twice to multiple plates in the party.",

Watermelon and cucumber salad was cool, refreshing, and an interesting presentation. Their barrel-aged cocktails will knock your socks off - almost literally - heavy on the alcohol, which I consider a plus in my drinks. Loved the coffee-rubbed short ribs. The accompanying cherry BBQ sauce was the perfect blend of sweet/tart, and wasn't thick or gummy as so many BBQ sauces can be. My only complaint about the short ribs was a personal preference issue on the side ... I HATED the pureed parsnips. Think of nasty mashed turnips, and then make them sweet .... BLECH!!! Thank heavens they didn't contaminate the ribs (lol). The waitress kindly brought me some mashed potatoes instead. Friends had the Cuban sandwich (pronounced both \"tasty\" and \"huge\"), and the chicken (\"spicy and delish\").  Friendly smiling staff, attentive but not hovering service, altogether a great experience. Word to the wise for anyone with hearing aids or other hearing issues - concrete floors mean the place is super loud.",

I'd had a meal Mastro's the night before, this meal was much more tasty and about a third of the price. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it was a little on the loud side-not too loud to carry on a conversation though.",

Some of the best stuff that we all tried at our table was the Bacon-Fat popcorn, short ribs, meatloaf, the Original Chop Salad and the Ruben appetizer.  For all you Gluten-Free people out there too, there are a TON of options on the menu and they are called out, so it makes ordering easy.

    "text": "When I review restaurants . . . service, atmosphere and food get weighed almost equally. Maybe it was an off night for CPH, and perhaps based on previous reviews, my expectations were too high. I so wanted to give it five stars. I took a friend from out of town there for the last night of Arizona Restaurant Week.   The Pros  Food - (5*) The menu choices were fantastic -- something for everyone. We both ordered the Original Chopped Salad and the Scallops. Both were delicious. (FYI - I had the Kantak Chopped for three nights in a row now, twice at Amaro in Cave Creek. It is my new favorite!) The flavors and textures in this salad are perfect. The pan seared scallops were tender, juicy and sweet. Desserts for me were overkill, but it came with the meal. The \"Pig in the Orchard\" Bread Pudding was delicious, but not as delectable as the Irish Coffee Pot de Creme which sent me to Cloud 9.   The Cons:  Atmosphere (3*) Even on a Sunday evening, the dining room is really loud. Even though we were sitting next to each other, we were borderline shouting just to be heard. Nevertheless, the design is cool and inviting.   Service (2*) Our server had zip personality, made no suggestions whatsoever, and didn't bring any bread. She brought our entrees to the table when I was clearly still working on my salad. (One of my biggest pet peeves!)   Will I go back? Absolutely. Based on all the other reviews, this just might have been a peculiar instance so I'm willing to give it another shot.",

    "text": "Citizen Public House is a great addition to the Old Town dining scene. I love seeing restaurants crop up in that part of town that aren't just catering to the bar scene and making the food an afterthought. My girlfriend and I made reservations for Friday night expecting Bernie Kantak's new restaurant to be packed. Much to our surprise when we arrived, the place was pretty dead with tons of open tables. We purposely arrived early to enjoy a cocktail at the bar and even though we could have been seated right away, we pressed forward with our original plan.  At the bar, I ordered my usual cocktail while the GF ordered a sangria off their cocktail menu. We also ordered an order of the bacon fat heirloom popcorn from the bar snacks menu. My cocktail was perfectly made and my GF loved the sangria. The popcorn took forever to come out, but when it was delivered they also brought out an order of the calamari compliments of the chef. The popcorn was a little bit burned and we both thought it could have used some salt, which was surprising since we thought the bacon fat would have provided that flavor. The calamari was perfectly cooked and not greasy in the least. I enjoyed the pickled fennel on the side, but my GF isn't a fan of fennel, so she didn't try it.  After we finished our cocktails at the bar, we moved to a table for the main event. In an unusual move for us, we skipped wine and stuck with beer and cocktails, but I did eye some good finds on the concise wine list. For our appetizer, we ordered the sausage of the day, which was a beef based sausage with a cabbage casing. It was very unique and we both really enjoyed it. For our main courses, the GF ordered the AZ B.L.T. and ordered the Pork Tender Loin. The B.L.T. had tons of perfectly crispy bacon on it, but we both agreed that it was really good , but not great overall. The Pork Tender Loin, on the other hand, was excellent in my opinion. I loved the figs and the sweet potato-chevre strudel. Of course, you could put chevre on anything and I would like it.  When it was time for dessert, we knew that we had to try some of Tracy Dempsey's latest creations. We normally split dessert, but decided to each get our own. The GF got the cookies and milk and I had the chocolate toffee bread pudding. The cookies are delivered in a bag that you can take home, which is great because you probably won't down the generous serving of cookies in one setting  unless you're sharing. My GF was quite happy to take home a little bag of cookies to enjoy later. My bread pudding was awesome and I wish I could have purchased a gallon of the Maker's Mark ice cream to take home with me. I'll definitely be craving this dessert in the future.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is a little austere, even for my taste. It just seems like they could a little bit to make it a little bit more warm and inviting. Service, while extremely friendly, was a little bit uneven throughout the night starting with the snacks at the bar taking a long time and continuing with confusion over what tables plates should be delivered to. Keep in mind the restaurant has been open for only a week, so these are things that can be worked out.  We were really surprised to see the restaurant so empty on a Friday night, so I hope more people give it a try. Citizen is a really good neighborhood restaurant that has the potential to be great. We look forward to trying it again to see how it improves and evolves. I'm really hoping it's a successful staple in Old Town for years to come.",

    "text": "I picked this restaurant for an out-of-town dinner based on the Yelp reviews, and was very disappointed. I don't know if everyone else here just came on a better night with a different staff or what, but this was not the dining experience you all described. The food was just OK, not awesome or Earth-shattering. We had a variety of appetizer plates - mac n cheese, crab cakes, chicken & waffles - that were way overpriced and just average at best. We didn't get the pork belly because they wouldn't serve it without the sauerkraut - made from brussel sprouts!?! (seriously?) The server also raved about the drinks there and the \"awesome mixologists\" but the bar selection was tepid (no Sapphire, only Beefeater?) and they couldn't even make a mojito? I know that can be a  'specialty' drink in some areas but we saw plenty of them on other menus around Scottsdale. But the worst was the service and attitude of the staff; we were IGNORED all night. The server was affable and friendly but would disappear for long stretches of time. 20 minutes to get drinks, when the bar wasn't busy?? And our appetizers took almost twice that long to appear. He also forgot the bread, and didn't ask about another round of drinks until we were ready to leave! The place was a little busy but hardly packed (it was after 9pm), so we couldn't figure out what was going on.  It seemed like everyone working there was more concerned with enforcing the cool hipster vibe than actually doing any work. Except for the hostess - whose job apparently involved stomping through the restaurant periodically and angrily glaring at us like we were keeping her from something far more important. Seriously, we barely interacted with this woman (other than to ask for a table) and yet we were ducking the daggers shooting from her eyes all night. WTF was that all about? Look, any restaurant can have an off night; maybe they were short-handed in the kitchen or something. But to not acknowledge it all and generally avoid your patrons is not the tactic I would have run with.",

    "text": "Citizen Public House is just one course away from 5-stars. It was sad really because it is that last dessert course, the final swan song of the meal, that I most remember and it was terrible (some of the most awful dessert I have ever had). On the upside the dessert did have a really tough act to follow; the cocktails were amazing, the appetizers scrumptious, the main course delicious, and the service excellent.  The hummus appetizer had some of the best hummus, pita, and pickles I have ever had. For the main course I had the Smart Chicken and for a chicken dish it was outstanding. Now they tell you that it comes with mushroom onion hash, but really it is just a saute served over the chicken which is perched atop a lovely corn risotto. It is the flavor that counts and that was out of this world. There is just nothing like a dish that presents such dimension of flavors and delights the palette. My co-diners were all equally pleased with their mains.  Sadly things took a serious downturn at dessert. We ordered the cookies and the strawberry pound cake. There were about 4 different cookies in a bag presented to us, they were not warmed, and honestly out of the four of us we couldn't find one of them we liked. We felt a place and bake cookie from the grocery store would have been better, *sorry* but I have to tell the truth. The pound cake was supposed to be an olive oil cake, which I have had many of in the past and so when I got this dry scone-like cake instead of something moist and perfectly rich I was greatly disappointed. Not to mention there wasn't one fresh or macerated strawberry on the plate, in fact those that were cooked into the cake were not even identifiable as a strawberry any longer.  Despite the sad ending to our meal, I would highly recommend you give this place a try, just skip dessert. They have only been open about a month and are doing a phenomenal job. I will definitely be headed back when in Scottsdale again.",

I've been a patron 8+ times now. he is singlularly responsible for the 2nd visit which has turned into unplanned but definite neverending visits to cph.  i order out here and there from cph.  when i came in one night to pick up the food he rang me up and i told him to keep the change, as i always tip when picking up take out.  (i'm in the service business). he thanked me and then asked if he could get me a drink while my order was being bagged.  i pick up all the time and am never asked this by waitstaff. this made the difference. i enjoyed a shirley temple in a to go cup and naturally he served it without charging.  i don't own a large operation like cph but how nice was it be served a non alcoholic beverage grazie.  again, the little added touches are what keeps a customer coming back.  if only other establishments offered free soft drinks while waiting for food.  the women's bathroom appears to be cleaned every time i've had to use lady's room. i've not yet (can't believe it) consumed any dessert.  i'm also wanting to try the grits app.    every person i've taken to cph has enjoyed it.",

Burrata was our starter -  Good but again nothing that left any real impression.  Not the type of place that left me thinking \"Gosh I cant wait to return\".  Probably wont.",

The salad has smoked salmon, Israeli cous cous, arugula, tomatoes, sun dried cor, pistachios, almonds in a buttermilk pesto dressing. I have been thinking about it ever since. I had the butternut squash chowder, which is not like most butternut squash chowders. Think bacon, squash, corn, chicken broth. Yummy. Food is delicious every time.",

    "text": "Do what you do and stop trying to be gimmicky/cute.  That's the only advice I'd have for CPH.  They certainly don't need any advice on decor, food preparation, or service because all were stellar. The wine list and beer selections were very good and the menu itself is drool-inducing.  Here is what I mean though...it's called a \"Public House\" but it's a very sleek and upscale restaurant. It's not a pub and I get that but that sort of \"we're being cool\" irony bleeds over into the menu, the food, and the experience.    Another example, happy hour isn't happy hour, it's \"Social.\". Yeah, ok.  Awesome.   Furthermore each item we sampled included some sort of out of the ordinary ingredient that seemingly didn't belong. This worked terrifically well on the chopped salad.  This dish was just a unique medley I would have never thought to mix.  However the odd ingredient technique fell flat with the pork (fruit??) that was otherwise a terrific dish.  It also didn't work with the bread pudding (bacon).  Now, I know what you're saying, \"bacon is never a bad idea.\"  While that is usually accurate it was completely unnecessay in this dessert and actually disrupted the flavors.  Strip out those mediocre additions and those dishes would have been perfect.   Overall, while gimmicky the food is executed professionally and if in Scottsdale you won't go wrong here.  Maybe one day I'll come back to \"Citizens\" for \"happy hour\"...that'd probably be a 5-star review!",

But the flavors, textures and aromas - nothing harmonized. I literally had an upset stomach afterwards.

    "text": "This place is fantastic.  In town for the weekend, and tired and criminally under-dressed in a hoodie and jeans, came here after not finding much else that tripped our trigger in the downtown area. Boy, what a surprise!  Classy inside, with the New York-like black and white interior, with lots of sleek lines and glossy surfaces, we were welcomed immediately and led to a table where our server showed up attentively, but long enough for us to get settled in. It's a talent I wish more servers had.  Ordered cocktails, which we enjoyed, but the real shining star was the food which was outstanding. Let me recount:  Bacon Heirloom Popcorn Chicken and Waffles Mac n' Cheese Pork Belly Pastrami Truffle Grilled Cheese  Aside from being WAY too much food for two people, everything on that menu save the grilled cheese was delicious, and the grilled cheese only didn't reach that mark by a notch or two. They have many main courses, but if you don't get the pastrami and the chicken and waffles, you're cheating yourself.  Prices are what you'd expect for this type of atmosphere and location, and I'd suggest getting lots of appetizer type food rather than getting a full-on main course, though I'm sure those are delicious as well.  Also an excellent place for sending guests who are from out of town for weddings in the area for dinner the night before.",

Scallops were huge and savory on bed of grits, but it felt a bit stingy to only give 3 scallops.  4-5 would have been better, and not cost them a lot more really in ingrediants.  Atmosphere is upscale, trendy, clean lines, what you expect from any new upscale restaurant.  Service was extremely good.    So why 3 stars.  I could easily have put 4 stars.    But the food was NOT outstanding.  Good definately.  Very good, mostly.  Just nothing stood out as mind blowing.    Which is fined except when you are dropping around $100 for two people.  For $100, I expect outstanding.  Would I be back.  Sure.  Great place to go out with another couple, enjoy walking around, enjoy a good meal.",

It was trendy with it's wooden accents, lit candles, and stark white linens.  The service was outstanding. Couldn't have asked for a more knowledgeable and sincere guy. Even when someone in our party ordered something that is normally sent back he let her know, and then gave her another option that would go with the tastes she was looking for. He was wonderful at pairing the perfect wines with our food.  The food was out of this world. We shared the Chopped Salad (which has it's own Facebook page, lol). It was hands down the best salad I've ever eaten, and I'm not a salad person. We both ordered the filet mignon which came with some greens and smashed potatoes. I've have never had a more tender and juicy filet in my life. It was absolutely fantastic! Hats off to the chef!  Please know this place is quite pricey so be prepared for that. Our salad, two filets, and his two beers came to about $93 but it was so amazingly worth the splurge.",

The interior and vibe is cool, although I did find it to be a tad on the noisy side, but that is not the reason for the three stars.  I only gave three stars because I was really disappointed in the food, maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt let down.  We started with the Pork Belly Pastrami, and while it tasted good, we weren't blown away.  I love spaetzle, but I found this version to be dry.  We did enjoy the chopped salad, I wasn't sure that I would because I am not a fan of salmon, but it was by far the best dish we had, but I didn't love it enough to warrant a return visit.  I had heard such great things about the seared scallop dish, and it was served with things that I love...bacon...spinach...grits...it should have been a winner, but it was not!  The scallops were really mushy, and the cola gastrique was overwhelmingly sweet and overpowered everything else on the plate.  I didn't even bother eating the third scallop....it was sad :(  By friend ordered the Pacific Rockfish, it was cooked fine, but it was bland and the other stuff on the plate really didn't add anything or make it taste any better.  Since we were celebrating, and still hungry because we didn't eat all of our sub-par entrees, we ordered dessert.  We got the PB&B Bread Pudding, it was rich and delicious, with banana ice cream, peanut butter and chocolate all swirled together.  We enjoyed the dessert a lot, so it made up for our lackluster dinners.  Maybe since it was a Wednesday it was an off night, but I would be hesitant to try it again anytime soon.",

We didn't have reservations, so they said it would be 15-20 minutes, which was fine, but this was a Tuesday night and there were at least 7 open tables, some of which were never filled while we were there. They also seemed to seat one of their friends who didn't have reservations as we overheard. That was a little frustrating but I was still excited.   We sat down and our waitress was very friendly. She apologized for the wait and immediately took our drink order.   I tried the beef short ribs which I thought was good, though, very fatty and somewhat small portion for 31 dollars. My friend had the lamb burger which he said was good, but somewhat dry. Overall, it was a pretty good experience, the food made up for the rest of the experience and I will go back again to try more.",

    "text": "What a fantastic break from the monotony! Although I have been here before this place truly never disappoints. We arrived around 7pm to a packed house. There were a couple of seats at the bar and we walked on up. The bartender Will greeted us right away and crafted cocktails for us. We were looking for a great Cosmopolitan and in lieu of that he presented us with \"The Socialite\".  Very tasty, light, sweet with a non abrasive tartness and a hint of effervescent. Now for the edibles. The Jucy Lucy, stuffed with two cheeses, one being Velveeta and cooked to order fries that arrived hot and crispy and perfectly seasoned. The Original Chopped Salad which give you the best part of a salad without all that annoying lettuce in the way. Cous-Cous, smoked Salmon, corn and so much more, tossed table side and perfectly dressed. And of course there's the Mac N Cheese. Although, the noodles were a bit aldente, the sauce paired well with it. A happy marriage of Gruyere, Swiss, emetic and spices and the best part a tomato onion relish tested on top. Each bite of this decadent pasta paired so well with the relish as it cut through the heaviness of the cream sauce.   So in Short awesome service, fantastic food. No wonder they were busy.... We will be back!",

It had a really intense flavor. The pan seared scallops were delicious but the sauce was a bit tense too. Overall, I believe the flavors of the food are really intense and a bit heavy for a hot day in Arizona. However, it's perfect for a pub.",

This is a sister restaurant to The Gladly. If you've been there there are many similarities.   The crabcakes are to die for, fondue was good, filet mignon tacos were just OK, short ribs were pretty good but the parsnip puree was amazing!  Black and tan dessert was also spectacular.

I will say their take on a salad is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone, but their bread is over cooked and smells like smoke trying to make it fancy and the butter they serve with it isn't any good either trying to be fancy. (Can't recreate the wheel, Its butter!!) my wife got the filet mignon which could have been ok but instead of just serving a nice steak they stack it with their purple potatoes, green beans that have a sauce, and pile onions on the top. You add all that stuff to a cheaper steak to improve its taste. When you are getting a filet you don't want it hidden in a pile. I got the scallops and i will say they stand up to their recommendation and i would get those again. For the price we had to wait quite a while on our waiter regularly also and although this is a restaurant and we were there at 6 pm we had to scream across the table to each other do to a 10 person group of guys acting like they were in a bar at 1 am.",

Finally, a friend was in town and wanted to grab dinner in old town - he said gastropub, so I told him to meet me at Citizen.  I didn't realize that the Cowboy Ciao chef who originated their fabulous chopped salad was the man behind Citizen Public House - when I found that out, we had to start with that!  In case you haven't had it, please allow me to explain.  The plate arrives with lines of chopped salad items, looking like a bunch of colored stripes.  The stripes include dried corn, Israeli couscous, smoked salmon, asiago, pepitas, tomatoes, arugula and currants.  That is topped with a housemade buttermilk dressing and mixed up.  It's a fabulous mix of flavors and textures - a truly wonderful thing to eat.  If you haven't eaten it before, stop reading this and head to Citizen Public House.  Now.  It's ok, I'll wait.  I decided to try the buttermilk chicken for my main course.  Wow.  I was expecting fried chicken (that's usually what comes after 'buttermilk' in a chicken recipe title), but it was grilled.  It was incredibly flavorful.  Very very good.  We ordered a couple of desserts for the table:  Pig in the Orchard (apple and bacon bread pudding with maple ice cream and blueberry sauce) and the Peanut Butter Strata Bar (white chocolate ice cream, peanut butter crunch and strawberry jam).  The Pig in the Orchard was spot on - order it.  I was a bit 'meh' on the Peanut Butter Strata Bar.  Cool vibe at the restaurant, and right in the heart of Old Town (kitty corner from Cartel Coffee - which, of course, you know already, because you always get your espresso there, right?)",

The food, service and atmosphere were perfect. We enjoyed the famous chopped salad, pork belly pastrami, and Swordfish. The Swordfish is supplied by Chula Fisheries. It is line caught and delicious. We would definitely return.  Tonight I had one of the worst dinners of my life at CPH. We are basically talking about the food from start to finish.  The Apps we had was the chunky Hummus. It was supposed to be creamy.   App 2 was the Pork Belly Pastrami. It was ok with a sloppy presentation. App 3 was the original Chopped Salad. Of course it's not original. It started many years ago at a restaurant on Stetson in Scottsdale named Steven. And the salad was called the Clearwater Chopped. Clearly a copy. And Stevens was much better with better quality ingredients. Dinner was awful. Swordfish tonight was overlooked and really salty. Airline chicken( was like it's name. It belongs on an airplane. A hunk of dried out breast with no flavor.  Service was fair but accommodating. Ugh!! On the rest.",

Appetizers: 1) Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut) 2) The Original Chopped Salad Please order both. They were both delicious! I was in love with the salad especially.  Entrees: 1) Lamb Burger (Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion, tzatziki, Kennebec French fries & house made ketchup) I tend to be very picky about my lamb... Actually I'm not reallly a fan of it/the particular taste and smell lamb has. Why I ordered this, I don't know, but I can tell you that I liked it. The taste/odor of lamb wasn't overwhelming and it was juicy. 2) Pan Seared Scallops (Hampshire bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens & Red Rock cola gastrique) 3) Amaro Meatloaf (Montenegro Amaro Italian liqueur, pork, beef, parsnip meatloaf, smashed Yukon gold potatoes, roasted zucchini, veal demi-glace): the server described it as very meaty and meaty it was! Usually meatloaf is fluffed up with a lot of bread crumbs, but this one was mainly just meat. The mashed potatoes were very good as well.",

I am not a fan of previous short ribs I have eaten so I got the chicken.  My husband told me that this meal is better than Houston's ribs.  I said \"No, way\".  I must say when I took the first bite of his short ribs when they came out, I was in heaven.  He was right, the short ribs were better than Houston's ribs, by far.  It was like big chunks of perfectly cooked roast over amazing, sweet potatoes and an amazing BBQ like sauce.  It is all I can think about still.  Yummy, delicious, mouth watering, tender, .........  On my chicken:  It was good but compared to the short ribs it was just \"okay\".  It was seasoned well.    Now I must also mention the amazing \"Original Chop salad\".  I had had this salad at the Gladly with salmon and was not a huge fan.  So, this time I got chicken and Oh my!!!  It was seriously the best blend of flavors and textures.  Again, this is not something I would have ever ordered on my own but I am so glad my husband pushes me to try the things he knows I will like.    It is a bit pricey but the salad and the short ribs are worth every penny!  For the drinkers, my husband swears by the Manhattan and the Moscow mule.  We did not get desert so I can not comment on them.    I could go on and on......  I would HIGHLY recommend this place ( and over Houston's too!  (sorry Houston's)) I promise you if you order just the salad and short ribs you will not be disappointed!    Enjoy!!!",

    "text": "Went here because of restaurant week and just had to try the \"famous\" chop salad.  I am wondering if that was the regular size or a smaller portion as part of the meal.  The scallops were huge so getting 3 is no biggie, I am actually about to eat the rest of it.  My hubby got the lamb burger, he loves lamb, and it was really good but a little greasy/oily on the bottom.  He liked the fries with the cardamom ketchup but I didn't care for them, but I did really enjoy the \"pickles\".  The restaurant is open but with that come loudness, the acoustics aren't very good.  Really liked how the bathroom looked and how the stalls didn't make you feel like you were trapped in a tiny box.  The host guys were super friendly, both on the phone and in person, I called today to make a reservation but ended showing up an hour early.  Bussers quickly came by with water and Kent introduced himself as our server.  Dinner started a bit disappointing and my side plate was dirty but then became much better after the first round of food came.  Will definitely go back again.",

The open, bistro feel with a lively bar crowd-the noise level is high but not annoyingly so. We had cocktails, which they are famous for-not too sweet and complex. We decided to try 4 appetizers-the stand outs were definitely the pastrami pork belly and the chopped salad. Service is efficient and casual, just the way I like it. I can't wait to come back and try the lamb burger and some of the entrees.",

Went with the bf on a Friday for a date night. We got there around 7 or so and the place was relatively empty - I was slightly nervous but I'd heard so many good things about this place, I knew it must've just been early.   We started with two dirty martinis, more like filthy martinis - just how i like it. Then we ordered the Chicken and Waffles appetizer, so good. It was mouthwatering delicious, I probably could've eaten 5 more plates. Then we had the Chopped Salad. It's effing amazing. I dream of this salad - I mean it does have its own FB page. Writing this makes me want it in my belly this second. For dinner, the beau got the scallops and I got the short ribs. Everything was cooked to perfection. Oh don't forget to have a moscow mule while you're there too.   By the time we left, the place was packed and I was so full I thought I needed a wheelchair.   I'm sure I'll be back for that salad and to try just about everything else on the menu.",

    "text": "For two people we ordered a lot of food (4 stars):   Chopped Salad is by far the most amazing and distinguished salad I have ever had. It comes with dried corn that acts like croutons of a typical salad, crunchiness, but unlike croutons, it adds a sweet flavor to the salad. Smoked salmon for the protein of the salad. There were also fresh chopped tomatoes, sun flower seeds, couscous, asiago, currants, and finally arugula as the main greens of the salad. Then it comes with an amazing sauce in which you have to mix into the salad.  Chicken and Waffles is a definite must try. The chicken is coated with a unique batter and topples over 2 pieces of waffle. There was too much butter on the waffles. This is kinda pricey for chicken and waffles, since in Los Angeles, there are places that service chicken and waffles at a cheaper rate but the flavors are unique enough for me to tell you to try it at least once from this restaurant.   Pork belly pastrami is overrated. I did not taste any unique flavors in this appetizer.   Lamb burger was too game for me. I usually eat lamb, but the lamb burger was too much for me. It was a decent burger but I would not get this entree again since it lacked flavoring.   Service (3 stars):   The waiter was very nice and we stroke up a couple of conversations with him. However, we noticed that other tables got bread and olive oil and we did not. In addition, we noticed that others that ordered the chopped salad, the waiter would help them mix the salad, we were not offer such service.   Ambiance (4 stars):   This restaurant is dimly lit, which sets a romantic atmosphere for those of love birds that want to only concentrate on each other. There is also a bar area that seems to be perfect for those are just got off work and want to have a good time with some co-workers.   Tips: Free parking is located in a lot around the corner of the restaurant. I would recommend making reservations since it can get packed during certain times i.e. dinner. We came around 630pm on a Thursday night and the restaurant was not full.",

For our main courses we had the meatloaf( a True \"meat\" loaf, very flavorful and filling), the short ribs( so tender they fell off the bone with a mouth watering BBQ sauce), the scallops( perfectly cooked with an amazing sauce), and the fish of the day on a risotto( mmmmmm, delicious). For desert we split the berry cobbler with a lemon ice cream...Wow, a perfect end to a perfect meal! As locals, we can't wait to come back and ask for Gary!",

I felt like the walls in this place needed a more color or something... Decor seemed to be pretty plain and didn't really go w/the vibe of the place. Cocktail of choice for the evening was The Persian and it was light and refreshing. I chose the whitefish special while my husband went with the short rib. While I preferred his short rib dish, both were delicious. Was not a fan of the Bacon Peanut Brittle. Overall I'd be back when in town.",

    "text": "The food and service were outstanding but the cocktails were a surprising fail.  We enjoyed the food immensely.  I never would have ordered the chopped salad without the advice of the other Yelpers and it was amazing.  What made it special was not just he flavors but also the way everything was chopped (of course) into very small pieces so it was easy to eat with large spoonfuls and get every flavor in every bite.  THe pork belly pastrami killed and was the best of the evening.  The scallops were excellent according to the guy that had them and wouldn't share as were the short ribs from the guys who was much more generous.  The beet appetizer was very good also.  Our server (Greg?) was excellent and really engaged with us and offered knowledgeable & confident advice on food, wine, and the unfortunate cocktails despite being very busy.  All this excellence is why I was surprised by the poor cocktails.  I started with The Beast - which tasted like blanco tequila on the rocks.  Now I love tequila, but that isn't what I ordered.  I'm a huge fan of Ancho Reyes but couldn't even pick up a hint of it or the limoncello or bitters.  I would have chalked this up to a mistake at the bar expect that the next cocktail - The Mexcacillin was only slightly better.  Despite being warned by our server that the smokiness could overpower lighter food - it wasn't very smoky at all and was itself overpowered by the grapefruit and lemon.  Not balanced at all.  Citizens need to get a mixologist with a better palette involved with the cocktail recipes.  Or at least stop promoting innovative and great sounding cocktails that are so poorly done.  But everything else is awesome.",

We were really excited to dine here and I reserved for 5:30 since it was still Social Hour until 6 and we could take advantage of those deals in addition to our main meal.   We were seated promptly and the restaurant was pretty empty but it was early. It quickly filled up so that was a relief.   We ordered a featured rose off the social hour menu and my husband ordered the Julep (barrel aged cocktail). My rose was excellent and supposed to be $5.   We decided to go with the Charcuterie Board to start and it was a good choice. Great meat and cheese selection with an amazing apple butter and ground mustard and omg, the bread was so good!  Suddenly I was full so we didn't order another dish. However, my husband wanted another cocktail and we were hoping to take advantage of the social hour price but our waiter didn't come to our table from 5:50-6:06. He didn't offer my husband the price on the social hour and instead came back to the table after we ordered the drink at 6:06 to say it wasn't on happy hour anymore and were we ok with that.   I've been to plenty places and when the happy hour is about to end the waiter either comes to ask if we want anything else or they'll honor the price if they're late to ask.   Then our check came and my rose was $10. No way. I got the waiter to correct it but come on...I shouldn't have had to point it out.   Sigh. Perhaps this is quite the spot and they don't care about lost revenue from visitors like me. Or maybe the waiter was mad bc we didn't order anymore food. I wasn't hungry anymore though and don't want to stuff my face just to get good service.",

    "text": "We had some people for out of town visiting and we were looking for a reservation for a large party and found Citizen Public. Me and my wife were the first to get there and right away the hostess tells us we have a hard out time at 8pm. We had a 6pm reservation. Sort of strange to me to pressure us right away but oh well  So they seat us in this semi private area with a large table away from the open dining area. You can see the dining area from our table. It just seemed like our server and hostess was very nervous to make sure we were out of there by 8. Anyways, our friends were a half an hour late which didn't help but oh well  I started off with the OMFG Chopped salad. It had raw salmon, dried corn, tomatoes, greens, etc with the dressing on the side. Mixed it myself. It was okay. Good salad. Would i order again. Not sure  I had the fair trade Short Ribs. Only reason I ordered this was because it was described as local coffee rubbed short ribs. Love coffee. You get four fairly large pieces of ribs with a dried cherry sauce on the side with some type of mashed potatoes and leafy greens. Ribs were moist and fell apart on a touch. Poured the cherry sauce on top and it was pretty good. Not great but good. The mashed potatoes were pretty good but just didn't think the greens went with this meal very good. So overall I thought the dish was ok.   My wife and son got the Amaro Meatloaf which was veal with mashed potatoes and roasted zucchini. It was pretty good. Moist and good. Thought the zucchini was overly seasoned but just my thoughts. It was a pretty good meal.   My mom and others got the tacos and it turns out this is three small street tacos. They said it was okay. Not sure. Didn't try but wasn't a lot.   Service was pretty good. Had people fill our water glasses. Check on us and took away our plates in a timely manner. Only thing that irked me was them constantly pressuring us to get out by 8pm. We left at 7:45 but felt pressured. So this didn't really help our meal. Didn't seem as pleasant as it could be.   The ambiance was very Downtown Scottsdale. Very loud. Upbeat. Dim lighting. Bar in the middle of dinning area.   So overall, the food was okay. Not great but good. Service really good but the pressure to get out was too much. Great upbeat ambiance for a younger crowd. Not really for older people who like peace and calm. Just really didn't feel the love at this place. So I give this place a 3 and a half star.   Will I ever come back is the True test. Not sure. The menu didn't really intrigue me but possibly I would give it another try.",

The decor and ambience was warm and inviting. The place has a huge bar and wonderful wine list and is the perfect place for a date night.  Because we had a big group We were seated in what felt like a private room at a large family style table. We started with a charcuterie board, asparagus and cocktails. My husband had the meatloaf and I had the pork dish for dinner. Both our dishes were amazing! At the end of our meal we all shared each of the desserts which were delicious ad well! We can't wait to come back!",

We sat at the bar and the bartender was nice and personable, filled our wine glasses from the bottle for us when it got low.  The wine was good and reasonably priced and the crab cakes were on point.  After I mentioned to some people that I went here, there seemed to be a common theme, did you try the Chopped Salad.  Well after hearing that on repeat for a week I went back and tried it- it was one of the best salads I've ever had!!!  I mention that I moved here from Chicago earlier to enhance my credibility on my delight for this salad.  It is a must and there's no wonder why people rave about it!",

The bar team is super friendly, answering questions about unfamiliar ingredients in their drinks, and even letting us taste a few samples before deciding on what to order.   We tried three from the barrels- all were good, but the Bonded Boulevardier was my fave. The barrel aging really mellows out the Campari. B went with the Instant Gratification (cognac/scotch/amaro/grand marnier), also very good.   Grab a seat at the bar and watch the talented crew do what they do best- if you're lucky you'll even see them light something on fire. :-) Great place to start the evening.",

The pork shank was amazing, and the short rib was amazing and amazingly rich too.   When we got there it was so crowded we didn't think we get in, however they were happily able to assist us in seat us right away. Our Puerto Rican server was a blast. She had a big personality. I'll bet if they took some of her abuela's recipes they'd be in seventh heaven. Actually no, as there food is wonderful.   It should be noted, there was a patron who got out of control with his drinking & the bartender asked him to leave, the staff handled this jerk professional and quickly.   Love this place!",

    "text": "Beautiful atmosphere and great service. Unfortunately, the food was not up to the same standards.  We walked in on a Monday night and the place was largely empty, which worked well for us. We sat outside on the patio, which was well lit and nicely appointed with a great view of the restaurant itself. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered the Deep Sea Red Crab Cakes to start, and really admired the flavors. The crab cakes were well cooked, and the red pepper aioli added an unexpected but delicious kick. Unfortunately, there was just far too much aioli on the plate, making it the star of the dish, not the crab itself, as it should have been.  As it was quite late, I decided to skip an entree and just order another appetizer as my main course. The butternut squash gnocchi with pecan pesto and brown sugar sauce sounded amazing, but it was probably the worst thing I have ever eaten in a restaurant. The gnocchi seemed to have been deep fried, so they lacked that soft, melt-in-your-mouth taste that I love in gnocchi. They were chewy and meaty - in fact, when I passed one to my husband, he asked, \"What kind of meat is in this?\" The \"sauce\" was a very light slop that did little to mask the texture of the gnocchi. I actually had to stop eating because I thought I was going to be sick if I put another one of those gnocchi in my mouth.  Perhaps I just didn't order the right things at Citizen, but I can honestly say I will not be returning for another go.",

So when I walked in and saw a plain Jane restaurant with a concrete floor and nothing to absorb the noise, I was surprised. It is loud and there is not much ambiance. On a brighter note, our waiter was one of the best. He brought us drinks quickly and gave us good advice. Our table started off with the fondue which was very nice and great for sharing and the tzatziki. For dinner we ordered the scallops, the meatloaf, the short ribs, and rabbit (not my order). Overall it was okay, but not amazing. Apparently the rabbit was the best meal on the table. My short ribs were a little dry but the parsnip puree that accompanied it was delicious. We had the dude jar for dessert which won me over. I would give the food and ambiance three stars but because of the waiter I bumped it to four stars.",

Chopped salad was delightfu and pretty. I love my truffle cheese sandwich.  It was delicious,  first bite was heaven. Yummm The gnocchi was alright, I felt like they open a can of tomato can paste and threw it on a plate.   drinks, The hot pink Paloma was a bit bitter, but thw after taste was perfect. My friend had the sangria, all I taste was the juice. It would be nice if they made it stronger.  $2 per person to cut OUR cake..... umm yeah. There's three of us. What if we had a huge group?!!?! -he up sale my entree without telling me, but he comp me.  I shall come back!!",

    "text": "Gastronomic greatness, at happy hour prices! -------------------- We were in town visiting some friends, and they recommended we check this place out. We were VERY HAPPY we came here!  Sat at the bar at around 3:30 in the afternoon. Then we learned there was a happy hour with 1/2 price bar snacks, cocktail drinks, and draft beer. Score!  What we got: - house hefeweizen: just a little more \"hoppy\" than I'm used to, but still crisp and refreshing. Plus, it was only $2.50.   - chopped salad: have you ever had a salad that has its own Facebook page? Didn't think so.  This was a very colorful and delicious mix of chopped smoked salad, Israeli couscous, toasted pumpkin seeds, arugula, and fire roasted tomatoes.  They mix this at tableside. What an explosion of flavors and textures: creamy, salty, smoky, nutty, soft, crunchy.   - Pork belly pastrami - GET THIS!!! This is a popular choice, with succulent pork belly that melts in your mouth. This is paired with fried spaetzle, and sauteed brussel sprouts.   - chicken and waffles: chicken thigh meat, fried to golden crispy perfection with rice flour. Comes with a small waffle with a dollop of savory butter.  Served with a small ramekin of honey. If you aren't a douche, they might give you a bit of maple syrup as well. Extra bonus!  This place is definitely worth checking out.",

Get the smoked salmon version okay.  What makes its special is the great mixture and variation in texture of the different ingredients.  And I am not a very selective palate eater and cannot usually detect any subtle differences, but this mixture of ingredients screams very soft, to soft to medium to medium hard to hard to crunchy.  Its very well balanced.  I had meatloaf and it was very good, the sauce they use to coat the meatloaf gravy is very good.  My friend had the scallops and it was cooked very well.  Just right, not over cooked and rubbery or undercooked and raw.  U may think its not a big deal but trust me, not a lot of restaurants can do it properly.  service here is top notch and everyone is very nice and polite.  the place is a little noisy and can get crowded which might make it a tad noisy to have conversation.  but its pretty good overall and I had a wonderful experience here.",

So, where to start. We looked at the menu and honestly everything looked good but because I wasn't that hungry we just ordered enough for my husband.   We ended up ordering the Original chopped salad (this is a must order!). You will not be disappointed.  The ingredients is like a chopped salad  like no other.   For the entree we ordered the Amaro Meatloaf.  Omg!  This Demi glaze sauce could have been a tad more generous but the entire Dish was unbelievable.   We finished off with the Black and Tan dessert.  Eat it In small bites cause it's a little on the heavier side but delicious.   I really wanted to come back here to try the scallops, the pork belly, Mac n cheese, the pork cheeks, the crab cakes, the gold and red beets I mean really?  Need I say more?  Strong Yay get yourselves down here to try.",

Had the filet Asada tacos and the catfish poor boy....meh.  They were ok, neither was anything special.  We both agreed we should have stuck with the fondue and each gotten a salad.

    "text": "Citizen Public House is a very popular fine dining establishment with a brew pub atmosphere.  The food is uniformly well-prepared, tasty, and attractively-presented.  The portions tend towards large, especially the rack of lamb which has about a pound of meat in it. The service is exemplary; the staff really tries to provide whatever you need (or think you need) and with genuine warmth instead of a frozen smile.  Should be five stars.  But what's the story, Richie?    Well, the story is that Citizen Public House doesn't measure up completely as a five-star fine food establishment.  The food is not innovative and the flavor profiles are simple.  Worse, it is just too darn LOUD!!  Noisy restaurants are a \"style\" today, but not my style.  On the other hand, Citizen Public House doesn't qualify as a five star casual eatery, because the prices are too high.  I really would like to sample the cuisine again, but I am not willing to subject myself to the audio assault (if you use a hearing aid and can turn it off, it might be okay).  I would like to go when it is not crowded, but apparently that is never -- be sure you make reservations.",

It's been more than 10 years since we've been to the old Scottsdale area and while some things are the same, it seems the dining scene has improved significantly.  Citizen Public House is an example of that.  With classic minimalist decor, we felt a comfortable yet energetic vibe from the minute we walked in.  The service from the hostess who greeted us to the waiter and bus staff are friendly and eager to make your experience a great one.    After a quick tour of the menu and some stellar cocktail selections (the Capital Paloma was amazing) we landed on Crab Cakes and the obligatory Chopped Salad to start.  The salad is absolutely a signature dish and their spin on it makes it like no other chopped salad you've ever had.   For our main courses, we tried the scallops, short ribs (the parsnip puree on the side was delightful) and a few orders of the short rib tacos.  On the side we shared an order of the Mac 'n Cheese - it was delicious with a spicy tomato salsa on top.  Honestly, I would return for the salad and that dish alone!  We were stuffed but made room for dessert...The Dude Jar and The Heart of Caramel.  We thoroughly enjoyed them both.  Citizen Public House should make our \"Best Of Scottsdale\" list for sure.",

I selected the Zacapa 23 in a snifter and a rock. Single barrel whiskey and Riesling rounded out the table. We shared the bacon fat popcorn and chopped salad. Both best I have ever tasted. Yup best!  My selection was meatloaf. WOW it was presented like a dessert. Just try it. The chicken and yellow rice equaled the cuisine in Miami or Tampa. Who needs dessert...",

The food was thoughtful and modern, but still really accessible. We ordered a few starters and a couple entrees to share. I definitely recommend the chopped salad and fried catfish. The buratta and filet asada tacos really good too. Highly recommend if you're visiting Scottsdale and want a have a casual, yet sophisticated night out.",

Some of the food was served cold, and the lamb was served undercooked from what was requested. We mentioned it to the server and requested the lamb to be cooked a little more, as he asked how our meals were. He went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied with not only our food, but our experience at this restaurant. Everything was exquisite.   I've never felt more appreciated by a restaurant for our patronage. With all that was done I can't bring myself to give less than 4 stars, even for an imperfect meal. Hopefully on our next visit it will be a solid 5!",

    "text": "FINALLY. Got the chance to try this chop salad so many people rave about...  We got the Spam Cuban, Chopped salad for a late lunch, the Instant Gratification and the Beast for our midday cocktails.  I like how they age their own alcohol in barrels next to the bar. Pretty neat and aesthetically pleasing. Hubs got the Instant Gratification which was a blend of bourbon and whiskey? or something like that... Anyways... it was an extremely smooth drink. I liked it a lot.   The Beast was a Tequila based drink which the server said, \"is sorta like a margarita\". Which in my humble opinion, was not the case. It was better than a margarita :) the citrus wasn't overwhelming and the balance between the mixes and the alcohol was perfect.  Onto the food... Spam Cuban was very good, great balance of the sweetness of the pineapple and Hawaiian bread with the mix of spam and pork. The home made dipping sauce for the fries (cuz Heinz wasn't good enough) was this chipotle sauce that had a slight kick to it, which provided a nice subtle touch to the fries.   My salad... oh my salad. I see why people rave about it. From the surface, it doesn't appear to be too complex but I'm sure even if I tried, I'd never be able recreate this salad at home. There is a certain level of umami going on in this dish. I'll have to go back several more times :)",

Don't get me wrong, the food was pretty great, the service was good and the drink menu was awesome and unique.  I had the Lamburger which is basically a Gyro on a bun but kind of deconstructed.  It was very juicy and flavorful but I probably should have ordered it mid-well instead of medium as I freak myself out over undercooked ground meat.  My fault though, not the restaurants.  Definitely worth a try.  Give it a go!",

    "text": "Me and a couple friends from San Francisco were in Phoenix for a conference, so we went on Yelp to find a decent place to have dinner and drinks.  CPH's high rating caught our eyes so we decided to give it a try.    We went on a weekday around 6:30pm and we were seated immediately.  I don't drink, but they seem to have a decent selection of drinks there and my boyfriend really liked the beer he got.  Our waitress (excellent service by the way) highly recommended the chopped salad ($12)so we ordered that, the cheese fondue, the seared scallops (entree, $24), mac & cheese and crab cakes.    I'm normally not a salad person - being Asian, I preferred my veggies cooked.  However, I do love smoked salmon, so I tried a bite of my bf's chopped salad.  Wow!  I was impressed.  The mix of spinach, corn, couscous, pumpkin seeds and salmon created a unique texture and the flavor was perfect with the dressing.  I ended up finishing my bf's salad after he was filled up on the cheese fondue, which was also excellent.  My seared scallops were fantastic as well.  They absorbed the flavor of the bacon bits and were very tender.  I tried a bite of my friend's mac & cheese and it was delicious as well.    Overall, we were very impressed that such a gem exists in Scottsdale.  We couldn't help but think that if the place were in the Bay Area, it would be PACKED every night.  Also, the pricing is very reasonable for the quality of the food and service.",

Citizen Public House has a cool vibe; good lighting, a vaulted cieling with dark wood beams, a large open patio, and a bar in the center of the room where all the drink magic happens. I didn't try a cocktail last night, but the drink list looked really good. A lot of classics with a twist.   Our server was awesome - very helpful and passionate about the restaurant. We decided to share the wagyu burger and the grilled cheese of the day. Both were excellent! They came with pickled vegetables on the side (awesome flavor) and \"healthy\" fries (if you don't like greasy fries, these are perfect) served with homemade ketchup. They also rotate a sausage dish of the day (interesting combos such as Schreiner's sausage chorizo corn dogs).   I'm excited to go back to try entrees and drinks. Yay for CPH!",

I normally drink red wine when I go out but last night I decided to step out of my comfort zone (thanks to one very knowledgeable and helpful bartender) and try a cocktail.  Thank goodness I did!  The Moe'scow Mule was fantastic and exactly what I wanted.  I told him I didn't like sweet drinks and he picked the right one for me.  Vodka, ginger beer, lime and cucumber.  It  was refreshing and delightful.    Next up comes some little samplings of their flavored tequila courtesy of that same bartender. Now that is what I call great service!  I actually don't like tequila but these were actually decent.    Choosing what to order for din din was difficult because everything sounded great!  I decided to go for the AZ BLT which had bacon, Campari tomato, and greens all on caramelized French bread with some sort of mayo heaven on it.  O-M-G!  It was by far the most delicious, perfect BLT I have ever had!  Seriously....I couldn't get enough.   After dinner, Richie the Mixologist came over to us and my friend asked about a Bananas Foster drink she had over at the old Estate House.  Richie said he would make us HIS Bananas Foster drink to see what we thought.  Next thing you know he is lighting things on fire with a blow torch and mixing it all up.  Wow!  Quite a show and the finished product was heaven.  The perfect ending to a wonderful experience.  The staff is very knowledgeable and passionate about their restaurant and it shows.  So warm and welcoming!  Citizen Public House is a diner's dream and I can't wait to go back to try everything else on the menu.  If you haven't been, you are truly missing out!!!",

For dinner my wife and I got the Smart Chicken and the Wagyu Burger.  the Smart Chicken was rich and tasty.  Definitely a good call.  The burger had some very interesting flavor combinations that were all a good call.  The sliced carrots and pickled onions made a nice crunchy taste to the burger.  The Challah bun was a nice touch, but ended up being a little more dry that I would have desired.  To provide some honest feedback, I told our server that the food was great, but that the bun was a little dry.  She went and talked with the Chef and came back to tell us that they were really sorry that the bun was dry and that they wanted to comp our burger.  Wow, that was completely not necessary, but incredibly nice!  They said that they wanted to be sure we were completely satisfied with our experience and were sorry that it was not as perfect as they had planned.  This place was top notch on their presentation, service and quality!  I would go back in a heartbeat!  Many Thanks Citizen Public House!",

It's the best. I had the scallops over a corn risotto and cola glaze. My wife had the buttermilk chicken, which had a surprisingly nice, spicy kick. Both definitely delivered.

    "text": "Parentals brought yer boy here for bday #29. The wifey and I were early so we sat at the bar. I ordered a Manhattan. That ish was turnt to eleven. Bartender made us feel special. Sparks were flying on the conversational tip and literally as well. There was fire involved with the assembly of my drink. Fire is dope. Ma n Pah arrived so we moved from the bar to our table. The ambiance was sessy in the dining areas. Dim. Candles. Music. Booze. If you are trying to get under some garments then I recommend bringing your date here. Our waiter danced through the menu for us.. highlighting all his favorite items. Dude was like the Fred Astaire of wait staff. His charm worked too cuz my party ordered like everything off the menu. Pork belly. Fondue. Mac n cheese to start. I recommend you not order both the mac n cheese plus fondue because they use the same cheese for both. Good shit none the less. Belly was ill too. Dem brussel sprouts on the belly had me smiling.. the 16 year scotch which I transitioned to probably loosened that grin a bit too. Yum. Mom got ribs. Wife got chicken. Dad got meatloaf. Birthday boy (muah) got the duck. I tried each dish. All were spectacular. The chicken stood out though.. and usually I'm like: fuck ordering chicken at a nice(r) establishment. I remember thinking, \"For reals boo? Chicken breast?\" But oooh weee was I wrong. Delicious. Bread pudding was sweet to start then finished spicy as a damn Puerto Rican. What a great time!",

    "text": "Even without taking advantage of the wonderful specials for Yelp Restaurant Week, CPH is one of my favorite restaurant samplings.   Waiting just a few minutes for our favorite foodie friends, we sat at the bar, having a brief chat with the charming bartender, who was very familiar with the yumminess that is Tito's Handmade Vodka and other great Texas food and drink.  Our friends arrived before we even had a chance to choose a beverage, so we moved to our table. After perusing the cocktails, our friends chose a Moe-scow Mule and a Sazerac, while my husband selected the Berried Alive and I ordered the Count Negroni, never having tried Campari.  Our waitress (Gina?) was a delight, telling us about the specials and reminding us the drinks were all hand-made so there might be a slight wait.  Moments later, with drinks in hand, we had appetizers on the way (we chose the sausage of the day and the famous chopped salad, then later added the crab cakes and the bacon fat popcorn).  The drinks were described as \"another one of these would kick my butt, but it's really good\" (Sazerac), delightfully refreshing (Moe-scow Mule) and very good (Berried Alive).  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with my choice.  My husband jokes I'm the only person he knows who likes the taste of Nyquil and Pepto Bismol, and I generally do enjoy very strong drinks, but the Count proved to be too bitter for my palate.  As if she had donned her Carnac the Magnificent hat, Gina came to check in and suggested if we didn't care for our choices, she'd gladly switch them out.  Oh, yes ma'am!  I'll take a Berried Alive, please.  The chopped salad was a pleasant surprise, but I'm not sure it's at the legend status of having its own Facebook page.  The crab cakes were very tasty, my only wish was for a bit more of the aioli.  My favorites were the sausage of the day, slightly spicy and served with braised greens and the bacon popcorn, but of course, how bad can anything be drenched in bacon drippings?!?! The lovely L.C. and I each chose the scallops (at half price thanks to the Yelp R.W. special, quite possibly the deal of the century).  Wanting some wine with the scallops, I wasconsidering an Argentinian pinot grigio or an albarino from the Central Coast (intriguing because most albarinos I've had are Spanish).  Asking Gina for her recommendation, she quickly offered to bring me a taste of both, as well as another Spanish white.  Gina, you are definitely my kind of girl.  While I would have easily enjoyed any of the 3, my top pick was the Central Coast albarino. When presented with the scallops surrounded by sauteed pea shoots and atop a lovely bed of corn and bacon grits,  we both were delighted with the flavor combination.  Due to a bad experience with scallops several years ago, I had been off the shellfish for quite some time.  Chef Bernie's treatment convinced me that yes, scallops are good again.   The boys went with the pork loin (another special) and the coffee rubbed short ribs.  I didn't taste the pork, but our friend proclaimed it very good.  I did get my husband to part with a small sampling of the short ribs, parsnip puree and cherry bbq sauce.  Oh my stars, it was quite possibly the closest I have come to the flavor magic that is delicious Central Texas barbecue (for those of you who have had the privilege to sample Smitty's, Kreuz, Black's and the original Cooper's in Llano when those temples of carnivorous delights are at the top of their game, you know what I'm talking about). After all of this, we still managed to order 4 desserts.  Our friend is a major chocolate hound and had to have both the Pots de Creme AND the chocolate pecan bars.  It of course helped that they were part of the special menu.  My husband went with the bread pudding (any type of bread pudding/custard/flan/creme brulee are among his favorites).  The delightful Gina also told us about a new trial dessert not yet on the menu: donut holes dipped in cinnamon sugar and served with 3 dipping sauces.  HELLO GORGEOUS, you had me at cinnamon sugar! The donut holes were by far my husband's and my favorite, especially when I drizzled them with a bit of each of the sauces (lemon, blueberry and caramel).  Usually a fan of bread pudding, my husband admitted it was not among his favorites.  He said it maybe could have been served slightly warmer   It was probably just because although good, it paled in comparison to both the donut holes and the pots de creme. After a delightful evening made that much better by the company of our dear friends, delicious food and drink and warm, professional service, we left sated.  We will definitely return, hopefully soon.",

Thomas and Richie Mo behind the bar consistently deliver some of the most innovative and tasty concoctions in town. The appetizers are to die for. My girlfriend dreams about the pork belly pastrami and the chopped salad is second to none.  Then there are the entrees. Hoo boy. The duck leg is some of the finest around, and their nightly specials can't be touched. Top it off the service is all around amazing. I cannot recommend this place highly enough.

The atmosphere was warm and comfortable it was easy to pull up to the bar and spend hours talking and enjoying the different offerings. The service was spot on- both bartenders were there when we needed anything and both were genuinely friendly people. The food was absolutely perfect, good size portions, the flavors were excellent and at a good value.  We had the popcorn bar snack, the chopped salad, scallops, and the chocolate jar dessert as well as their bread pudding. The only thing I probably won't do again is the popcorn- but I am not typically a popcorn kind of girl. Every aspect of the food and presentation exceeded my expectations.    Am so glad they participated in yelp eats week- it motivated me to make it a point to eat here. I live in central Phoenix  and I am not sure I would have trekked over to Scottsdale for dinner over eating somewhere closer to home before. But, I can gaurentee I will be back often, it is well worth the extra drive.",

They fell right off the bone and had great taste.  they pair it with a mashed potato that had a weird spearmint taste that overwhelmed the dish.

It's still a good restaurant, but I expected great, so that's influencing my rating here.  As for the deets... atmosphere was excellent and I'm glad to have a place like this in the area. We had mixed reviews on the food, however. The bacon popcorn was interesting and tasty. The chopped salad was amazing and I agree completely with other reviewers on that one. I would have liked that as an entree size and skipped my main plate. I got the pork sirloin, which was dried out and the flavors were trying too hard. Maybe it was exacerbated by the contrast between it and the salad before it, which was so lovely and subtle in how it came together. I was disappointed. I got my fiance to agree to split the entrees and had part of his Smart Chicken. It was certainly better - well cooked and juicy, with delicious crisp skin on top, but the flavors were overpoweringly earthy - the balance wasn't to my taste with too much mushroom (I love mushrooms but to be fair, these were one of the few kinds I don't like for this reason). As for dessert - I had the bacon apple bread pudding, and though I liked it, some of the bacon inside was too soft and put me off as far as texture. I also didn't like the strong smokiness left in my mouth in the end of the meal. I've had bacon in desserts before that did a better job balancing the sweetness with the meatness and this was just ok.",

It was nice to get a free chopped salad because we got a bottle of wine.  The chopped salad was amazing as always (cowboy ciao original) Since the weather has still been nice out, the patio was packed.  Unfortunately the draft beer lines were not cooled (I experienced this managing a bar....not fun) so no beer on draft was available.  Not a big deal having had the bottle of win.

My friends had steak and pork rib, and the pork rib was easily the best dish. It was infused with a subtle flavor none of us could place, and was perfectly tender. Many of their desserts had bacon in them, and it was good, but I am partial to not putting bacon in everything.

We booked our reservation on Open Table. We were seated right away, water poured , Katie our server introduced herself and wished us a Happy Anniversary right off.  We started off with Cocktails: Manhattan and a Thai Margarita, both were very good. We opted to make a meal and share appetizers so we can taste a variety of dishes. We started with the \"special\" Uni Shooter, not a typical shooter style, the piece of uni was a good size but was overwhelmed by the Asian pear mushroom compo. We then moved onto The Original Chopped Salad (corn, couscous, smoked salmon, asiago, pepitas, tomatoes, arugula, currants, buttermilk pesto dressing) and the Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut, mustard jus). Both dishes were excellent. We then had the Chia Seared Tuna (Thai purple sticky rice, asparagus puree, fried leek & micro green salad) and the Deep Sea Red Crab Cakes (smoked re pepper aioli & celery root slaw), we both felt the tuna was good but the asparagus puree was odd and weak. The crab cakes were excellent. We ended the night with Katie delivering a wonderful complimentary Anniversary desert of a Chocolate Cake with Ice Cream topped with the best Carmel sauce I've ever had and a sprinkle of the bacon popcorn.  Atmosphere was very nice and trendy, service was excellent \"thank you Katie!\", food and drink were very good. A restaurant that is a must try.",

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was you'd better have a LOT of time to kill for dinner, as we were there for over 2-1/2 hours all told.  It is quite loud in there when it is a full house.  It makes it tough to converse but it's a good vibe, so it isn't offensive.",

Every part of this salad is done right and tossed right.  A must order.  Then we had the meatloaf and the potato and zucchini was the best I have ever had!!! Hands down the best restaurant experience I have had in two years our server Gary was the best server I have ever had.  He knew when to leave us be in deep discussion.  Our water was always full.  Our food always tabled properly he deftly knew what we wanted and when we needed anything.  He represents Bernie as a down to earth amazing man and executive chef.  We finished our meal with the heart of caramel.  The chocolate was unbelievably good and the ice cream was excellent.  I can't wait to go back!!!",

    "text": "We really enjoyed our meal at Citizen Public House.  Our first move was to order drinks - my wife's sangria was particularly refreshing.   Our first bite was the optional bread service, served with a notably good olive oil. For starters we had the much acclaimed chopped salad. I typically don't address salads much in my reviews, but this salad was one of the highlights of the meal and our trip - it was awesome for a couple reasons. First, the flavors were great.  I didn't catch all the components, but the freeze-dried corn added crunch, and the protein came from smoked salmon. Second, the theater of the salad presentation and preparation was awesome. The server presented the salad with its ingredients nearly arranged in rows, and he added the awesome buttermilk dressing and tossed it at the table. The results were amazing. Our second starter was the Chia Seared Tuna, with purple sticky rice, asparagus puree, fried leaks and greens. The colors and presentation were great but the flavors were more muted. We liked it and it was fine but it was far overshadowed by the salad.   For entrees my wife had the scallops and I had the filet. The scallops were exceptional - perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned on a puddle of creamy and buttery grits. Loved them. The filet was fine but not really exceptional. I liked it a lot and the preparation was fine but it wasn't really all that memorable. I did like it though. I really wanted the scallops but decided not to order the same entree as my wife.   For dessert we had the brownie sundae, which was good but not exceptional. The brown butter ice cream was a little icy - not offensively so, but it didn't taste like it was made same-day. The brownies were ok too.  The bartender was particularly attentive (in a good way). My brother-in-law (to be) was interested in trying a couple varieties of Scotch and the bartender came to our table and delighted in detailing his thoughts and letting him taste several options.   One more comment on Citizen Public House is that it could really be anywhere - from the menu you wouldn't know you were in the Southwest - I didn't see even a single solitary chili pepper on the menu.  Recap: chopped salad, scallops and service were all high points. Great place. Thumbs up.",

    "text": "Second time here was not as pleasant as the first visit. This was during restaurant week. I loved dining the first time and was excited to dine the second time. This time around I tried the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn for $5, their Fair Trade Short Ribs which is prepared with a coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veggies for $30; and their Bread Pudding for $6. The Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn was regular popcorn with bacon bits and fat. If you're a bacon lover you might want to taste this. It's a simple snack to munch on while reviewing the rest of the menu.  Hmm how shall I put this ....... I can only equate the entree dish to nothing but \"Fair\" - exactly as it says!! And I didn't get a fair trade at all either for $30. It was coffee rubbed so dry and over cooked that my jaws  were gnawing on each piece pretending to like that darn meat! I dipped each piece in the cherry BBQ sauce but it was still parched and punishing experience to the mouth. Luckily I had asked for the bread pudding which was well hydrated served with strawberries and cream. This is a restaurant week dessert not in their main menu.   The final straw of the evening was the check for a party of 9. At the bottom of their menu it states in fine print: Split checks unavailable for parties larger than 8. First of all, the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own separate check leaving 8 people left. If you allowed one person then you must do for the rest at the same table.  Was she afraid she wouldn't get her 20% or more gratuity? If the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own check the group becomes 8 people or less. Which means we CAN technically split the check any which way. Instead the waitress proceeds to tell us she can't do that. And on top of that she proceeds to tell us that we need to calculate our own tax and tip!! You mean to tell us that a nice sophisticated restaurant lacks a POS system with zero capabilities of generating the math for you?!?!?!  Here's another kicker: At the bottom of the original receipt the waitress hand wrote herself a 20% gratuity. Again, the POS system lacked being able to incorporate the added gratuity on a receipt and the total cost. I find that a shocker. After the whole fiasco and doing our own calculations and making it inconvenient for us diners we were glad it was over. The experience overall was a disaster but the bacon popcorn and bread pudding made up for a bit of it.  Maybe a hit and miss type of deal. :/ Never dine here with a group more than 8.",

    "text": "Dining here with a large group was a trip. Eating in groups larger than 8 can get interesting, but the peeps at CPH were on their \"A\" game from start to finish. Service was seamless and so was the food.  The Chopped Salad alone was a 5-star experience. WOW! It's been a long time since a salad has left me in a state of \"awe.\" This is no exaggeration my friends. Israeli Cous Cous, roasted corn, tomato, pepitas, smoked salmon, arugula and currants with a wildly delicious buttermilk pesto dressing. This salad certainly does have it's own Facebook page, and I LIKED it! The salad is dressed and tossed table-side. It was love at first bite and I can't wait for my next visit to PHX to fall in love all over again.  Next, that bacon popcorn was delectable. Not really sure what makes popcorn \"heirloom\" popcorn, but that bacon fat and bacon lardons mixed in were perfection. This wasn't the first time I've eaten bacon popcorn, but it was the first time I didn't find it overly greasy.   U-10 scallops were my choice for dinner and they were seared to perfection. I'm not a fan of lot's of sauce and reductions on my seafood, so the dish was little on the rich side for my taste, but I think this would be winner in most people's books.   By the time dessert came around I wasn't quite sure I could take another bite of food I was so full! By this point I was entering my food coma and this part of the evening is pretty much a fuzzy.   I'll definitely be back to CPH. Food and service were excellent and they really made sure our group had a wonderful time.",

    "text": "I came here the other evening for happy hour and ended up staying for dinner.  I am very impressed! We ordered the crabcakes, which were light, fresh and tastey. They are deep friend but it didn't feel unhealthy or overly saturated in fat which was great. I ordered the scallops because of all the wonderful reviews on here, and yet again yelp did not fail me! My friend ordered the short rib, which was also excellent, I like how they serve the sauce on the side as to not over power it. One thing to note though: my scallop dish was very small (3 scallops) and my friend got two massive pieces of short rib. The portions were way off. I was still slightly hungry after my scallops and 1 crab cake, so of course we ordered the apple bacon bread pudding, which was nice. The blueberry sauce they put on it is great, not too sweet and compliments the other flavours nicely.  The ambiance is also very nice, with lots of light and fresh air coming in, crisp white tables clothes while still giving the allusion of being somewhat casual.   The cocktails were okay as well, the ones that we tried from the menu didn't amaze me. But weren't bad either, I'm rather picky admittedly. I did have the bartender make me an extra dirty martini which for once in Arizona was done almost perfectly. I don't know what is it with the desert but they can't make a martini to save their life. But here it was pretty good, I'll be returning for that. I should also note they have Sipsmith here! Haven't seen that in other bars in the area so I was very excited as that is my gin of choice.  All is all - nice place, good food, decent price, acceptable cocktails.",

    "text": "Wow, we were blown away with our dining experience! It was completely unexpected. We truly enjoyed the delicious food and service was OUTSTANDING. I rarely identify people in my reviews, however Gary deserves the praise. From the moment we sat down, he was friendly, charming, and attentive. His positive attitude and demeanor was infectious and it absolutely made our dinner more special. Even as he tended more tables, he hustled to get to everyone. We were so pleased. To top off an amazing evening, he waited for us at the entrance and held the door open as we left!  The Good Citizens Social (H/H) is 3-6pm daily. All bar snacks, draft beer, and glasses of wine are half off, their barrel-aged cocktails are $5, and three appetizers are discounted. We were dining unusually early since we wanted dinner before the Jason Mraz concert, however, we were able to take advantage of the Social.  Ruben opted for a pint of Anchor Brewing California Lager ($5; H/H $2.50). I settled on The Craftsman ($12; H/H $5) made with Barrel-aged Jameson Irish whiskey, Cocchi Americano, and Charbay Green Tea Aperitif.  Rosemary Roasted Nuts ($5; H/H $2.50): A mixture of nuts roasted with rosemary. Great flavor and a wonderful snack to munch on while having a couple drinks.  Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn ($5; H/H $2.50): The popcorn was very lovely and the addition of bacon and its fat was scrumptious. Another fantastic snack!  The Original Chopped Salad ($12): Smoked salmon, Israeli couscous, arugula, trail mix of toasted pepitas, black currants, and aged asiago, freeze-dried corn, marinated roma tomato, and pesto buttermilk dressing. Wowza! I knew the salad was popular (I mean, it has its own Facebook page), but I didn't expect to be hit by the combination of flavors and textures. It is so, so good and surprisingly light. Great dish to split as an appetizer. The recipe is available on their page, but it's much more complex than I thought and it's one I'll leave to the professionals. I would absolutely return just to eat this salad again..and again.  Buttermilk Chicken ($20): Roasted Smart Chicken breast, Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, sweet corn-butter bean succotash, and Pecorino. We chose to also share our entree and our server was kind enough to split it for us. The chicken was moist and flavorful, the succotash was creamy, and the brussels sprouts were perfect. All the flavors worked and it's probably one of the best chicken dishes I've had.  (All their desserts are made by Tracy Dempsey Originals, a local company creating sweet and savory confections)  Bacon and Peach Hand Pie ($11): Candied bacon, salted Bourbon caramel ice cream, and peach jam. The pastry was perfection combined with the sweet and salty bacon, ice cream, and not-too-sweet peach jam. Fantastic dessert option!  Bag O' Bacon Brittle ($10): The Original Bacon Pecan Brittle packaged to go. My family and I love brittle (and c'mon, bacon?), so I picked up two bags to take back to Vegas. I haven't had a chance to indulge yet, but I will update when I do!  I highly recommend dining at Citizen Public House. Although I like to try new restaurants on future visits, this is somewhere we won't want to pass up!",

    "text": "Happy Birthday Elizabeth. I'm still smiling that your birthday is on the same day as my oldest daughter. Happy Birthday TJ.   This is a wonderful dinner house in Old Town. The use of white and black in the interior design creates a stunning and dramatic decor. White table cloths and napkins. Intimate nooks where a family or group can dine at a large table. Family photos framed and grouped on walls in a very precise manor. Excellent touch.  I begin with a Junipero martini 12. with a twist of lemon from Elixabeth. Did I say that right? A superb intoxicologist, super friendly and very sharp. She introduces me to Andrew Fritz, one of the partners and very friendly front man.  We speak of the upstairs, mixologist, partner, Richie Moe and I am sure that their new venture Citizen R+D will be cool as hell. Not to spill too much about the new venue but I can confirm the existence of a program known as Citizen Research + Development, upstairs over the Public House, that will showcase experimental procedures from the land of craft cocktails and spirits. Richie may become the worlds greatest living mixologist.  Last but not least Chef and partner Bernie Kantak. Bernie will be preparing a pork belly pastrami rye spaetzle with brussels sprout sauerkraut. 12. This appetizer is presented beautifully. These flavors mingle and marry and are a very nice treat. A little shout out to Thomas, I think we were having a little fun but after two drinks, I can't remember.  And I left forgetting to have desert, coffee and donuts 10. Next time my friends, next time.",

They had a set 3 course menu for $55 due to the holiday which was not clear when making the reservation, however we went with it figuring that it could be more expensive elsewhere. I had the Lentil and Sausage soup - which is good and tasty and my wife had the greens, both were pretty tasty.  Next up was a Filet for me and Butter Chicken for my wife.   I would say I got the better end of the deal but the food was all good.  To finish was a chocolate tart and sorbet \"duet\".  This was ok and probably the weakest part of the meal. Beer selection was good (we are not wine drinkers) they even had Framboise which is unusual. All in all a good start to our NYE celebrations!",

That being said, both times I was there for events, and both times CPH did a great job.  My first visit was an event with passed appetizers and drinks shortly after they opened, and the other was for a happy hour / sit-down dinner for a group of 45 people, just last week.    Since it's more fresh in my mind, I'll go into more detail about the latter visit... We started on the patio and had drinks and some light apps including hummus and flatbread and their delicious bacon fat heirloom popcorn.  (They had vegetarian popcorn as well).  After about an hour, we moved inside to where there were three large rectangular tables set for our group with our own special menus.  We were able to choose from two mini-salads and four entrees and then we had family-style desserts.  I went with the infamous \"original Chopped salad\" to start and then chose the Pan Seared Scallops as my entree.  I think I cleaned both plates... and those around me likely had order envy as I definitely ordered right!  In addition, service was spectacular... somehow the Citizen staff managed to serve all 45 of us within minutes of each other!  They also kept our waters and our wine glasses full, which I'm sure added to the experience.  I recently saw a preview of the new fall menu which includes some interesting items such as Chicken & Waffles, Applewood Smoked Duck Breast, and Grits + Gumbo... I will have to head back over there soon to give these things a try... that is, if I feel adventurous enough to order something other than what I know I love (the original Chopped salad and the scallops).  Whether you stick with your old stand-by favorites or try something new, enjoy!",

I am also planning on trying the scallops and the BLT sandwich next time.   The fact that they had a Moscow Mule on their cocktail menu was an added bonus. I didn't try it yet because I wanted to take advantage of happy hour and ordered wine instead, but I will be!",

    "text": "Absolutely spectacular. That is the only way to describe the food at Citizen Public House.  So let me start this review with my obsessive love for the Pork Belly Pastrami appetizer. Hands down one of the best things I've ever eaten. This pork belly is just the most amazing, literally melt in your mouth meaty/fatty goodness you'll ever taste. SO AMAZING. After tasting this appetizer, I seriously contemplated canceling my main entree and just ordering 5 more of the Pork Belly Pastrami. (Note: I did in fact return a day later to again indulge in the fatty pork belly goodness. SO WORTH IT.) If you order nothing else here, order the Pork Belly Pastrami. You'll thank me.  Quick note on the service and drinks so I can continue to rave about the food: J and I came here for a late dinner on Thursday and had really great service even though we were only sitting in the bar area. We again experienced excellent service on Saturday when we returned for a late lunch (and to introduce one of his friends to the incredible food! I spent so much time raving about the food on Friday that we had no choice but to come here on Saturday). J had what he said was an amazing old fashioned, and I tried their signature Citi-Zen which had a great pear flavor and was served with rock candy as a stirring stick. Candy with a drink, that's a definite win for me.  Back to the food: Pan Seared Scallops - Delectable combination of flavors. Salty and crispy bacon, sweet and smooth corn grits, with wilted snow pea greens that added both a nice color and flavor to the dish, seared scallops sit atop all this deliciousness. And then it is all topped with a tangy and tasty Red Rock Cola Gastrique. Did I make the correct dinner choice? Abso-freaking-lutely.  Amaro Meatloaf - J's dinner choice. A lovely combination of flavors, but I personally found it to be a bit dry, J loved it though. The mashed potatoes were buttery and delicious. And the roasted zucchini was fresh and very enjoyable. But I would still choose the scallops over this any day.  So when we came back on Saturday we decided to just order appetizers. Which was of course a good choice because mostly everything we ate was amazing.   We ate: The Original Chopped Salad - smoked salmon, Israeli couscous, and a bunch of other delicious things make for a very enjoyable texture and flavor combination - one of the best salads I've ever had! Chicken and Waffles - Think fancy chicken and waffles. Another great flavor combination - crispy chicken tenders with a kick, buttery waffle with almond butter, and all dipped in honey.  Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn - It is what it says it is. Bacon and popcorn. It's tasty, but only worth it if it's during \"Social Hour\" when bar snacks (and draft beers) are half off (so when this is $2.50). Grits + Gumbo - The only dish I didn't really like. I have to say I was pretty disappointed with this one. I felt like it could have been so much better. The grits were tasty, and the andouille sausage was okay. But the gumbo itself seemed kind of like a thick but not very flavorful chili. I would skip this next time.  Our friend that came with us on Saturday had the BLT and said it was outstanding. Which I would imagine it was, seeing as how the bacon came from the same company as the pork belly!  This review is extremely long now. But I swear, this place absolutely deserves all the praise! I suppose I'll stop now but I'll end with this...  Order the Pork Belly Pastrami!!!",

I make short ribs at home, and even use a coffee rub, and  I often order them when dining out, but these were the best, hands down. I hope to return here on my next visit to the Phoenix area. Any guesses as to what I will order??",

    "text": "I have been here a couple times now and it's definitely a place to check out.  As so many yelpers have already mentioned, the chopped salad is delicious. Definitely something to try at Citizen. Also, the pastrami!!! Oh man, that was so melt in your mouth yummy! Smaller portion, probably not a meal for most but it was so good I would order it again. The lamb burger is a huge meal that comes with perfectly crispy scrumptious fries. The patty isn't cut down with beef or pork so the flavor is very game-y which can be a good thing if you are into that. I wasn't quite so used to it. :) I also tried a bit of my friend's Smart Chicken which was amazingly tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned! Also, really organic and fresh which I love. I tried the Citi-zen mixed drink which was very lemony and a bit on the sour side. I wasn't in love with the flavor. I did however love the rock candy that came with it. lol.  The service was awesomeeeeee!!! We came in near closing but they still happily sat us instead of shooing us away. Our waiter was very attentive, answered all our questions about the menu and made some great suggestions. He also took us on a tour of the speak easy style bar upstairs which was super interesting! Apparently you go around the side of the building and there's a posting of \"the rules\". You call the number and if they have room you will be let up to this chic modern bar. All the mixologists make special drinks from their own liquors. Really cool!",

So I sent the salad back, gave my gnocchi away and the waiter had the chef fix my filet.  Now mind you, I cut my steak with my fork and knife and when they brought back my filet it was the same one so that means they re-cooked my filet after I cut it with my knife fork and germs...interesting.  Also for the amount of money you pay, the \"posh\" look, the snobs and wanna be's. ..the waiters need to learn to serve from the left and proper placement of a dinner setting lol.  The steak after the second time, mac n cheese were good but I've had better.  just being honest.",

    "text": "During my most recent visit to Citizen Public House, I sat at the bar with a friend and sampled several dishes from the late night menu. We had initially planned to wash down a bowl of Tender Belly bacon fat popcorn with our outstanding drinks (Richie Moe and his bar staff are the finest I know--but that's for a different show).  The popcorn was, as always, a real treat.  Crispy, fragrant, savory, salty goodness.  But then the gentleman beside us was served a pork belly pastrami, and the amazing smell was driving us crazy. So we placed an order for that and Chef Bernie's Original Chopped Salad (which he first introduced while at the helm of Cowboy Ciao and which I also find I cannot resist).  The pastrami is made of melt-in-your-mouth pork belly, and the sauerkraut provided a terrific tangy balance to the richness of the meat.  Typically, the menu at Citizen is stocked with dishes that are familiar but have their own particular twist.  In this case, the sauerkraut was made of Brussels sprouts instead of cabbage. And rather than pile the combination between two slices of rye, it was served with fantastic rye spaetzle (I learned to cook these dumplings in Germany, so I am usually leery of ordering them in American restaurants--but Citizen's were outstanding.  Chewy but still tender.)  After we finished the pastrami (and restrained ourselves from licking the plate), we dug into the salad.  It arrived on the platter in carefully arranged in rows (basically, a salade composee) of Israeli couscous, chopped arugula, tomatoes, smoked salmon, toasted pepitas, and Asiago cheese.  The dressing, which comes on the side, is a sort of slightly-garlicky Green Goddess, very fresh and light.  The friendly gentleman serving us offered to toss the salad.  It seemed a shame to destroy the lovely arrangement, but this is definitely an instance where making a mishmash on your plate is the way to go.  None of the ingredients lost their integrity, but the combination of flavors (sweet, salty, smoky, green) and textures was outstanding.  The crunch of the pepitas with the crispy greens and delicate couscous is as close to salad heaven as a girl can get.   I love desserts but rarely order them at restaurants because it's a course that can be pretty iffy.  However, I know that Tracy Dempsey does amazing work for Citizen, so I had to take a look at the evening's offerings.  I saw chicory ice cream and salted chocolate caramel sauce with chicory streusel, and any remaining self-restraint went out the window.   What a winner--again, excellent contrast of sweet and savory, perfect portion size for two to share.  My only quibble, and a minor one at that, was with the ice cream, which could've used a bigger boost of chicory.  But then again, not everyone loves chicory coffee as I do.  I'd be remiss in not discussing the actual space of the restaurant.  It would be fairly easy to pass Citizen by on the street; it fairly disappears into the bland exterior of a white building on the corner of 5th and Craftsman in Old Towne Scottsdale.  The signage, above the entrance on Craftsman, is not easily seen after dark. In fact, when standing out front once, I was stopped by a couple who asked me if I knew where the restaurant was.  The interior, while understated, is far from nondescript.  The center of the dining room is dominated by a large, stainless steel bar and the vaulted ceiling above with its exposed beams.  Seating options include freestanding tables for four, leather banquettes along two walls, an alcove that accommodates larger dining parties, and my favorite, the very comfortable barstools.  The color scheme is very simple--white walls with dark accents and clusters of artwork hung gallery style.  Still, there is no shortage of warmth in the room.  The staff is exceedingly welcoming and the service professional but friendly.  On peak nights, the acoustics of the space mean that it can get a bit loud, but noise fits right in with the idea that you are in a contemporary \"public house.\"  Citizen's combination of a lively dining room with an outstanding, innovative menu, top-notch bar and superb service will keep bringing me back.  Side note: some people seem to be confused about the difference between a \"public house\" and a sports bar.  If you want to watch television while you drink, I suggest you seek out the latter, as Citizen mercifully has no TVs.",

These guys mix all the standards exceedingly well, but take it to a new level with their barrel-aged concoctions. I often order a Sazerac (being a home-sick New Orleanian) and these guys make the best one you can find outside of New Orleans. The Happy Hour is a scorching hot deal, half price beer, wines and bar snacks (and they always have a great selection of all 3!).   The food is pretty amazing too....the pork belly pastrami is phenomenal. The chopped salad is iconic (has it's own facebook page?!) My favorite entrees are the scallops, Amaro meatloaf and Lamb Burger, but I've never had a bad dish here. Ever (and I work 2 blocks away and come here at least 1-2 times a month).",

The lepinja roll the burger comes on is absolutely perfect, the best piece of bread I've eaten in a long long time.  The porkbelly pastrami was rich and silky, but could have used more peppery pastrami-ness.  Still, a great piece of meat.  My wife did not love her grilled cheese.  She said the varied textures of the cheeses was not pleasant.  I had her leftovers the next day, and I tend to agree.  Very good flavor though, and again, superb bread.  They serve Goose Island Matilda on draft, which is now my favorite beer.",

    "text": "This place does it well in every way.  I had my birthday dinner here for a party of 16 on a Saturday night in December.  I had previously tried Citizen during restaurant week but my BF who arranged the evening had never been.  They seated us at a wonderful table near the front of the restaurant in the semi private alcove.  It was perfect, very intimate and I was able to hear everyone and mingle and socialize with my party.  The service was absolutely fantastic - never was anyone in my party left thirsty as our alcohol tab demonstrated at the end of night.  We actually had 2 servers who circulated and made sure that everyone knew what wine was open, etc.  We were there for over an hour before we began ordering appetizers.  When I apologized to the server, saying I hoped we were not taking too long in case there was another seating for the table, he told me not to worry at all, that this was ours for the night.  I like a leisurely paced dinner, especially when I'm the guest of honor.  My BF had bought me a Lisa's Rum cake, and even though they charge a $25 fee to handle and serve the cake, they did a wonderful job.  I declared it the best bday I had ever had :)    They are owned by the same group as Cowboy Ciao, which I have been a longtime fan of.  The original chopped salad which has it's own facebook page, yes, yes - they have it, and therefore I have not been able to order anything else to start.  It's just perfect.  I have also ordered the scallops each time I've been.  Corn grits and bacon along with cola gastrique combine with the scallops into the most awesome flavor and texture.  Not at all sweet, but rich and complex.  I also enjoyed their Moe'scow mule and they have a nice wine list.  The BF got the short ribs, and the first time he really really liked them.  I apparently tasted them but I was 2 hours into my bday dinner, and I can hardly remember due to the 2 martinis and countless glasses of wine. When we recently went back a week ago, he again ordered the short ribs, but he seemed less enthusiastic.  I tasted them, and I found the short rib itself to be quite good, tender, flavorful.  I did not care for the dried cherry bbq sauce.  I found it to be acidic and sweet, but not balanced at all.  The smell also turned me off.  I would go so far as to call it pungent.  It didn't compliment the short ribs, and neither did the roasted parsnip puree it was served with.  It was just too sweet.  I applaud their creativity, but in this case it just didn't work for me and I would have preferred something more garlicky and mellow.    Dessert and Espresso were fantastic, have tried the donutbread pudding and also the one with the chocolate pot de creme which I thought was more interesting.  Overall a totally solid 4 stars.  We will definitely be back again and again.",

While in Phoenix for business, I stopped in to Citizen Public House on behalf of the overwhelming number of great reviews. I enjoyed my food and drink, I really liked the location and the decor, the service was great, but I walked away with a sour taste on behalf of the value component. Few things put me off more than the feeling of being ripped off, no matter how good I think the end product was. The end doesn't always justify the means. And I know...it's Scottsdale, but I'm from Brooklyn. I'm no stranger to expensive food. I still know what my money should look like on the plate.  I ordered the filet asada tacos, and I just wasn't down with the $16 they ran me. The 3 tacos were small, not particularly full, and came with a half a roasted corn cob. Everything tasted good, but at the end of the day that's basically $5 for a taco. Maybe a little more. And they weren't even very substantial. I feel pretty strongly that either a couple dollars should come off that price tag or another taco needs to be thrown on the plate.   I was still hungry so I ordered the flatbread/hummus app to tide me over. All in all, it's a nice spot but I wouldn't be back.",

He asked if they could order more wine and I said yes, but it was a misunderstanding and he brought me wine - and then when I looked surprised he offered to cover the cost so I wasn't upset. I just split the glass with my customer, but it was so sweet of him to jump in quickly and notice my concern. I can't wait to take my husband back for a romantic evening out.

    "text": "After wine tasting at Carlson Creek, we took a short walk to Citizen for a snack and drink.  Another great find for us while visiting the Old Town Scottsdale area! We sat at the bar, which filled up quickly as the happy hour crowd rolled in.    The ambiance is nice. The bar is the focal point, surrounded by tables with white table cloths for a more formal dining experience. The servers at the bar were friendly.   There were some unique items on their happy hour and starter menus. We ordered Heirloom Popcorn with bacon (salty, greasy, I liked it),  Housemade Flatbread with hummus & tzatiki (good, though nothing too special), and Pork Belly Pastrami with brussel sprout sauerkraut (I was intrigued by the description. Pretty good).  As you can see, we went with a salty, greasy kind of theme.   Hubby had the cocktail of the day. He said it was ok, not much of a kick to it. After those very generous pours by Wendy at Carlson Creek, I stuck with ice water (it was delicious, lol!).   I would try this place again next time we are in town.",

    "text": "After dining at Citizen Public House, it's no surprise it's one of the top rated restaurants in Scottsdale! We chose the restaurant as the venue for our post-busy season office dinner and it did not disappoint. The event coordinator was very prompt with email communication and gave us the option to choose between a variety of set dinner menus. She also offered cocktail and wine menus to enhance our dining experience.   We all had the famous Chopped Salad to start. I was a bit hesitant as I'm not a huge smoked salmon fan, but wow, this salad was absolutely delicious. Not only is it beautiful plated, all the ingredients perfectly marry together. I was disappointed the portion wasn't bigger for the set menu as I could have eaten this for my main course!  For our entree course, guests had the option to choose between chicken with saffron rice, coffee cherry glazed short ribs with parsnip puree, and pan seared scallops. I chose the short rib dish and the flavor was phenomenal. It was paired with crunchy sauteed Swiss chard and I was shocked how much I enjoyed this simple vegetable. My only teeny tiny complaint was that the short rib was just a tad dry. The chicken and scallops dishes looked amazing as well, everyone was very happy with their selections!   For dessert we all had the smores pie in a jar. While it was perfectly sweet and decadent, it tasted a bit more like gingerbread pie. No complaints from me, just an observation.   What stood out above all was the service. We had a party of 11 and our glasses were never empty. Our server was very attentive and explained all dishes on the menu in great detail before we ordered. I also loved that when I asked the host where the bathroom was, he walked me all the way through the restaurant to the door. It was a nice touch that showed the waitstaff really cares about their guests and making their experience enjoyable.   I would recommend Citizen Public House to Scottsdale residents and visitors alike. You're sure to have a memorable culinary experience!",

Citizen Public House doesn't disappoint! Their high-end comfort food, fresh cocktails, perfect center of Old Town Scottsdale location, and cool ambiance make it the perfect destination for a night on the town.   I've come here for multiple celebrations and every time we've had a lovely experience. Whether you're coming with just 2 guests or 10, they can accommodate! I'm a creature of habit so for food, my favorites are The Original Chopped Salad (THIS IS A MUST), mac 'n cheese, and short ribs. I pretty much get at least one (or all when splitting) every time that I go. You also can't lose with any of their hand-crafted cocktails.   It is also worth noting that they have a great happy hour with smoking deals on light bites and tasty cocktails.   I just recommended CPH to family members last night who were looking to have dinner in Old Town! Definitely one of my favs and I know i'll be back soon!",

But the question is, is it worth it? Totally! We ordered a bunch of stuff here last night, including the burrata and crab cakes for starters, and the roasted chicken and scallops for the main courses. All of them were spectacular. For drinks we tried their house cocktails and were not disappointed either. However, the server's attitude could be better. If your customers are spending $200 on a meal, then they should deserve the humblest behavior, and suggestions/recommendations on every level. Not quite satisfied with the cocky attitude of the person serving our food though, but otherwise definitely a good return on investment!",

    "text": "Impromptu Friday night date.  First drove to a popular Tempe restaurant where the wait was 1.5 hours.  Then called another Tempe pizza place to inquire if they had gluten free pizza.  No.  This was the next call based on yelp reviews.  Was informed they have gf designation on the menu and they could seat us as soon as we drove over.   Restaurant was a tiny bit hard to find with entrance on the side road for a first timer.  Staff was extremely friendly.  Seating is odd as you are likely to be sat in the middle of the restaurant among many other tables as we were.  I hate having people sit behind me.  Waiter was very nice and informed us of the specials.  I ordered an iced tea with sweet and low.  Informed they don't have sweet and low - that's okay... it is important enough to me that I carry it in my purse.  Never got the iced tea.    My husband ordered the tacos.  They were okay.  Start off with a spice that quickly goes away.  Well prepared but simple.  The french fries that came on the same plate with the three small tacos were actually the best part of the meal.  I ordered the short ribs.  Small serving on a bigger plate which was fine I don't need huge portions.  The short ribs were super tender but lacked any flavor.  I didn't even finish one.  The cherry BBQ sauce was disgusting.  So sweet it overwhelmed any other flavor.  (Now to be fair my husband really liked the sauce and used it to dip his fries in.)  The parsnips were also average.  The greens on the plate were good.  I asked for different sauce to try with the short ribs and was brought out a demi glaze that was equally disgusting.  I'm confused by all the 5 stars but will agree to disagree.  Not all foodies will like the same thing.  With tip I think we paid around $53.",

    "text": "To save you some time I will just summarize, Citizen Public House is wonderful, you will not be disappointed. You should just go to the place and see for yourself, but if you want to hear about my experience it goes as follows.   I recently went to Citizen Public House and I had a fantastic experience. To start out, the staff was extremely friendly from the time when they greeted us to thinking us for visiting the restaurant. When you walk into the restaurant you get a nice homey feel with the wood beams overhead.  As you glance around the place you feel comfortable and the music isn't too loud to where you cannot hear the person sitting next to. The entire vibe of the place was upscale casual. You don't feel like you must throw on a 3-piece suit to attend but you know that you are walking into a very high quality establishment. Citizen Public House was fully able to uphold these expectations as well as exceed them in many ways.  The food and drinks were phenomenal as well. We started with a happy hour drink prepared by the bartender. The drink was a pink drink that was nice and refreshing on a warm day. From then we decided to go ahead and order something small to munch on (we weren't expecting to hang out for dinner). We ordered additional drinks as well, one of which we ask the bar tender what he really enjoyed making. He was able to construct a drink with the lead ingredient being green chartreuse. I have only had chartreuse a few of times and you can really tell if you have a quality bar tender if they are able to make a very tasteful drink out of that particular liqueur. We ordered the Fondue which really hit the spot. The sausage, pears, and bread were the perfect combination with a nice beer cheese. From there we decided to get some of the Crab Cakes, which I can say are some of the best Crab Cakes in the area. We closed out the night with some coffee and the Chocolate Layer Cake.  Overall the night was terrific. The attention to detail that every one of their staff possessed was unbelievable and for the most part, they took care of everything we might need even before we had to ask. Although the price was more than something like a Red Robin or Applebee's, that is to be expected when you are greeted with quality service and superb food. I left the meal and didn't feel like I got robbed. There have been plenty of occasions where you go to the restaurant and feel like you 100% overpaid for what you received. This is most definitely not the case at Citizen Public House. You are able to tell every one of the staff members were proud to be working there. To me,  this is what separates a decent restaurant with good food and good service to one of that is a memorable experience like that of Citizen Public House. I would most definitely recommend Citizen Public House to a friend. It is not an anomaly that Citizen Public House is highly rated here on Yelp.",

I went with a handful of co-workers and we all ordered a bunch of things and passed them around. No one was overly thrilled with the Duck Burger, but it wasn't bad. We loved the meatloaf and the short ribs!! The fondue was also an excellent starter!  I also have to mention that the service was great as well. Our server was very helpful when we were indecisive, he provided great recommendations.  I got one of the cakes on special for dessert and it was AMAZING! It was called the Fruity Pebbles cake - dense layered cake with a light lemon ice cream and topped with fruity pebbles. I was in heaven! I wish they had it all the time!

For our appetizer we ordered the kilt lifter fondue which was the best thing I ate all night. It had great flavor and I enjoyed all of the items we were given to dip into the cheese, especially the fruit.  We decided to split some of the starters for our meal and the chopped salad was good but not great. Overall that is how I felt about the meal as a whole. It was good but not great.",

    "text": "I am so bummed I did not make Citizen Public House as my primary special occasion restaurant to go to for my first visit to AZ. As I learn you do not need to be tied to a well known name to be put on the map and later to find out how disappointed you are with the meal & service (cough cough FNB ahem). Anyways, two of my friends mentioned this place and that was enough confirmation that this was going to be a great restaurant. So, I gave it a shot.   Walked in and was seated without RSVP or hassled for not having a RSVP.   Our server was very attentive, very engaging, and social with us and made the dinner experience enjoyable. Most places forget that you need to build relationships with your customers. It is very simple, it is not a secret, just provide excellent customer service. If you can't do that then you're in the wrong business.   So, with that I will def share my experience with yelp, non-yelp friends, and also I will come back next time I visit AZ. If I lived here, of course I will come in as a regular patron.   It is no secret CPH is known for what? Their amazing cracked out chopped salad called the THE ORIGINAL MIXED FEEL GOOD SALAD or for short OMFG! Like OMFG it should be on every menu in America like the Caesar Salad, Cobb Salad, etc. But even better than the traditional boring salads. The smoked salmon is a nice touch.   I have not had crab cakes in a while and CPH has the best, generous, heaping mounds of delicious Chilean crab cakes for you to enjoy.  I recently had a really sad crab cake at the Brigantine and yeah it did not compare to CPH's.  The last dish was the Gio Osso burger, the ingredients had me at foie gras aoili, it just sounds criminal smearing duck liver on a beef burger. The savory and rich burger was super delicious.   Did not end the evening with dessert, but I did take home a bag of bacon brittle. YUM!",

    "text": "(3.5 stars)  The food here is pretty decent and the service is great. My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night for date night around 7pm. Luckily, we didn't have to wait, but we were seated in an isolated corner (which we actually preferred).   Location/Parking: The restaurant is located in Old Town Scottsdale. We didn't have any trouble finding parking and were able to park near the restaurant.   Ambience: The atmosphere was classy but casual. The lighting was slightly dim, which made for a more intimate setting. Seems like a good place for dates and for light conversation.   Food: We ordered the Original Chopped Salad, mac n cheese, pan seared scallops, and short ribs. The salad, like everyone has said, is delicious. The server brought out the plate and mixed the salad in front of us. My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It had a nice combination of textures, and the flavors were well-balanced with savory and slightly sweet and salty tones. Definitely our favorite of the night. The mac n cheese tasted standard. It came with a salsa topping that neither of us enjoyed. The salsa by itself was good but didn't seem like it belonged on mac n cheese. We ended up removing it entirely from our dish. The scallops were nicely seared and had good texture. They came on a bed of sweet corn grits, topped with greens and pieces of bacon. The grits were amazing - perfectly creamy and complemented the scallops well. I actually did not enjoy the bacon, as I felt it overpowered the scallops, and ended up picking all the pieces off (I know, blasphemy!). The short ribs had good flavor but were dry and needed the sauce it came with.   Conclusion: Overall, we enjoyed our meal but weren't blown away. We'll likely be back but will try ordering other things, along with the chopped salad.",

Pork belly pastrami-  Oh my gosh so good.   Original chopped salad- Had to try this bc it's so raved about.  My first thought was how can a salad be so amazing?  So crazy how simple, fresh ingredients with a tasty dressing can be so yum.  I recommend. Get it.  Short ribs entree- Deeelish.  Short ribs just melt in your mouth, great sauce.   Pudding dessert-  We had some sort of peanut butter and banana pudding thing recommended by our waiter.  I'm not much of a dessert girl but this was yum.  Hubby enjoyed it since he loves pb and banana combos.  FYI: There's a happy hour here but I don't remember the time since we just missed it when we arrived for dinner.

The sauerkraut's acidity sort of took down the grease down a notch but I still find it a bit too much for me. Which was weird because I usually love fatty pork belly.  Original chopped salad (5/5): This was the perfect salad. The flavor, the texture, and the freshness of the ingredients, everything was perfect. I think it had salmon in it as well, which imo was the perfect protein to go with this salad.  Seared scallops (3/5): The scallops were cooked perfectly, but it was over seasoned. In addition, they garnished the scallops with bacons, which added more saltiness. I also didn't like the glaze because it was too sweet (I believe it was coke and red-wine reduction?)  Taste alone I think this place is worthy of a 3.5-3.8. However, I find the food a bit too pricey (came out to be $43 per person) so I'm giving it a 3-star.",

    "text": "The chopped salad is everything it's cracked up to be- must order! We also had the yellowtail crudo, I personally loved it and the rest of our table thought it was ok. Meatloaf portion is a very large portion, delicious comfort food. The tacos had good flavor but far too much meat and needed more sauce or salsa. The galette was very disappointing although if you like banana/chocolate/peanut butter flavor profile the push pop dessert is over the top good! Our waiter was helpful with his recommendations. We joked that he seemed slightly condescending about the quantity of food we ordered per the number of people at our table (we ordered a lot). Overall a nice dinner, nice atmosphere (slightly warm), and good food especially the chopped salad. I'm not dying to go back immediately but I'm glad we went and would dine there again when the menu changes and if I'm in the area.",

    "text": "This was my second visit here and I loved the food again! This time I ordered the scallops entree and it was delcious. Since my hubby and his parents came with me for restaurant week, we could choose the scallops, meatloaf, or \"smart chicken is cool\" for our prix fix menu entrees. Upon my first visit here for a friend's birthday, I thought \"Really? They actually named a dish \"Smart Chicken is Cool\"?\" I tried it anyway inspite of the title, and I'm glad I did, because the chicken was tender and really tasty unexpectedly. What was even better was the risotto that came with the chicken with truffle oil. I melt for truffles/truffle oil infused food!  The pork belly pastrami as promised did not disappoint! That disappeared very quickly among four people. Perhaps we should've ordered more? The Im-port mixed drink was very unique in flavor and almost sweet - reminiscent of a dessert port. I liked it better than the Sazerac, which was a little bit potent for my taste. Although I might've enjoyed it more if I didn't have the Im-port first. Our waiter was good and checked on us often, except when we wanted bread and he forgot to bring it to us. I'll let it slide though, because he was so good otherwise and brought us tons of other \"yummy\" food and drinks quickly after we placed the order and I applaud him for that on such a busy night (the end of restaurant week this past Sunday).",

It was my first experience with the original chopped salad and it was F'in delicious.   She was turning 29, so most of us are too young to be saying this, but the general consensus was that it was too dark, too loud and too warm, so that's the lower rating. The service was average, but she did let us know ahead of time that they couldn't split that many checks and helped up split it up as best she could.  I'd definitely return for a special occasion with a smaller group or likely, just a significant other.",

In other words, we never felt rushed. The waitress as well as the several waiters whom helped us were all great. I had a \"Julep\" drink to start which was very strong, flavorful. We started with Burrata, which was quite tasty, just the right size for two to share, and the bread was excellent. My wife had the Pan Seared Scallops, which she enjoyed but could've used 1 or 2 more scallops (there were 3 total).  I had the Gypsy Pork Shank. It was tasty, smoky, but probably a little heavy and fatty for my taste. The desserts were excellent--wife had the Black & Tan and I had French Toast Bread Pudding, which to me was absolutely excellent. I docked one star just for the entrees--for the price paid, I felt there could've been a little better balance on food quantity, and I just wasn't 100% pleased with the shank. The environment was quite noisy--not really an intimate atmosphere, but I don't think that was the goal.",

Our server was lovely and let us take our time deciding on each course before going to the next... We enjoyed the Famous Chop Salad, to see what the hype was all about and were not disappointed, although can see why other Yelp reviews comment on the smallness of portions. The crunch of the freeze dried corn was unexpected and the smoked Salmon sealed the deal! Next we split the Chia crusted Ahi and the Oso Bucco which were both perfectly executed and left us not a prayer of entering any room for dessert!

So we stopped in tonight, our 23rd wedding anniversary, after dinner at a French restaurant we wanted to try. Richie Moe, mixologist extraordinare and my drink hero was busy so his apprentice, Chris, made me an amazing drink. But Richie knew we wanted a taste of his magic so when he was free, he came by.  He remembered me and Yelper Shannon M and how much we enjoyed our drinks. When he learned it was my and Jim W's anniversary he offered us anniversary shots, saying he felt like lighting something on fire. OH MY GOD!!!  He started out with these two stainless steel pitchers - way too big for a couple of shots. He put in chopped chocolate, added chocolate liqueur and banana liqueur and heated the bottom of the pot. He then gently caught the contents on fire. That's when the real excitement began. He poured flaming liqueur from one pot to the other. Back and forth went the flaming lava-like stream, a brilliant blue and gold. When he was done he poured it into two shot glasses, added some sort of cream and grated chocolate on the top. It was warm, a perfect temperature to drink. And it tasted like a liqueur version of bananas foster. IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!  I'd been wanting to go back since Presidents day. Richie reminded us why. Chris is well on his way to being an amazing mixologist as well. You need to find out why too. Go now. What are you waiting for?!",

The scallops were cooked exactly right with the right sear and buttery texture.  The chopped salad is everything you've read about it, and more.  It's a pretty perfect balance of colors, flavors and textures.    The atmosphere is comfortable yet elegant.  The lighting, background music and seating layout were all just right.

Stellar ambiance, just the right lighting with a spacious main dining room but felt very cozy much like an old inn.  Loved that the bar is the center of the space because energy emanates from the bar to the tables, creating a real sense of communal dining.    Our server Gary was dynamite.  He walked us through the menu, focusing on his favorite items, and explaining in detail the ingredients and preparation and he was very influential.  Myself and a friend took his advice and thoroughly enjoyed the scallops, which were perfectly prepared.  My husband ordered the short ribs and he really loved them, especially the dried cherry BBQ sauce.  I was fortunate to steal a bite and they were delectable.  Our other friend loved the pork loin, which was also cooked perfectly.    We finished the meal with to-die-for donut holes with three dipping sauces - key lime, blueberry, and caramel-coconut.  So good!!!  Cannot say enough about Citizen Public House, and it is a must-have, and a must-return!!",

Our waiter was simply amazing - attentive but not hovering, very very helpful in choosing a wine (and letting me take a pic of the bottle so I could remember it!). He remembered our son from his previous visits.  The chopped salad lived up to the raves. The smoked salmon and dehydrated corn made all the difference in the taste and texture. It was simply amazing! My mushroom tartlet was earthy and tasty with some great light crust.  A must visit for Scottsdale!",

Despite the restaurant's success and  I am happy for them,  I found it impossible to carry a conversation with my friend without constantly having the repeat myself....and that just got old real quick.  As we sat down, I already knew I wanted out. The food was okay...definitely not blown away. I had the lamb sandwich as I wanted something that hopefully would not take long to make and minimize my time...so bottomline, what could have been a great experience simply wasn't...and the noise was just unbearable and exhausting. Gastropub maybe, just not the place for me....definitely not a romantic joint....  My friend had the steak salad, and all there was were greens and meat...no other veggies ...just thought t looked kinda bland and boring.",

Best salad I've ever had... That smoked salmon in it... Omg! My fiance had the meatloaf which of course i had to try. Perfectly cooked, absolutely delicious, and that mushroom cream sauce was the perfect touch. I had the pan seared scallops. First time eating scallops and they definitely set the bar! Soft like butter melt in your mouth delicious. Perfectly cooked and great texture. The greens, bacon, and grits were amazing! You have to include everything together... It will be the most amazing combo of flavors! For dessert we did the peach bread pudding and the black and tan, that bread pudding was the best I've ever had. We also had a few cocktails on their happy hour... Only $6 and they are definitely not cheap on the liquor! Holy cow! We had the Desert Sky, instant gratification, and the white sangria... All absolutely delicious! We CANT WAIT to visit again!",

    "text": "BACON LOVERS UNITE! Get your butts over to this place pronto! I found your heaven!!! My favorite bacon eater brought me here with a couple of friends without noting any sort of hidden agenda. When I saw the menu, I understood why we were here immediately...   Our server stepped up to the table and immediately started describing drinks and dishes to us without skipping a beat. He was educated about the food and it showed-- I appreciate that. He also made us giggle when he walked away from the table saying, \"I'll get your drinks and oh, I'll grab your nuts!\"  I must say, their nuts are candied and delicious. Just the way I like them.   So, my dearest friend was unafraid to try the artery-clogging dishes that he had lined up in his mind, and it started off with the \"Tender Belly\" bacon fat heirloom popcorn. Fact: It's pieces of bacon tossed in with some flavorless regular ol' popcorn. Does the bacon make it good? Sure. Is it something amazing? No, it's definitely a novelty and they are just having fun with it.   Next: We went for something healthy and highly recommended: The Mirliton Chopped Salad. As everyone has said, it's deeeeelicious. I wanted to marry it while I was on my salad high (I realized that marrying food just isn't sustainable...). Just so you know, it's not very big-- I recommend two people sharing it before your main dish.   Sandwiches: I got the Halloumi Sandwich. I love cheese, and I wasn't certain of what to expect with this dish, so I suppose I really had no expectations. The roll it came on was delicious, the chickpea puree was a great spread, I loved the tahini addition as well, but somehow I couldn't love the cheese. It just didn't have a texture that I am used to and it wasn't a strong enough flavor to balance it out. So...I \"hmm\" this dish. Not dislike, just...\"hmm\"...  My friend's dish: Another friend ordered the BLT and the other ordered the Pastrami. He ordered the Lamb Burger. This was described by the server as \"gamey\" in his initial description. I do not like that word. That sounds like the meat is going to have body odor, soooo I didn't order it! Fortunately for me, my friend did and it was a little overcooked for his liking, so we swapped dishes! HOORAY!! It was pure, premium lamb and the tzatziki and cucumber onion salad were complimentary and DELISH. No B.O. here, folks, just tasty goodness. The server took off the lamb burger because of the overcooked factor AND offered to bring him another one that was rarer. What great service!   Dessert: Yes, I continued my role as sidekick on the bacon-anza and got the \"Pig in the Orchard\" Bread Pudding. I was in a coma already, but I decided to just finish myself off with this one. The bacon adds really just another novelty factor to this dish. You could easily have just cooked the bread pudding with some of the bacon run-off and been done with it, the bacon taste would have been enough to satisfy the taste. The bacon chunks=overkill. The ice cream neutralizes it ever so slightly and gives it an apple pie savory appeal.  As the Bacon-anza came to a close, we were all turning into little piglets before our eyes with rosier cheeks and a light glaze added to our skin... Thank you Citizen Public House.",

    "text": "On Saturday I crushed the competition during the \"Great Urban Race\". I was in a race to Sunday because I knew my Wife and I were going to CPH on Sunday for dinner!   So we get there Sunday with Reservation. I order a Midwest Manhattan, it sucked and the B-tender noticed I did not like it. He asked me for a baseline of what I liked and made a drink for me based on that. Guess Im a fruit because he gave me something pearish with red bull! It was good. My wife got sangria which was killer. We were with other guests and wanted to try the menu, so here goes:  Appetizers:  Kiltlifter Fondue: 2.5/5 - Not a thick fondue....and thats ok because the flavour is sharp, which I like. What I did not like was I could not taste the subtle flavors of the hops and barley.  Bernies Mac n' Cheese: 2.5/5 - Pretty boring. Cavatelli, came to the party underdressed and overpaid. Same mix of ingredients in the fondue. Laughing at myself.  Pork Belly Pastrami : 4/5  - This could easily be a five. It just needed a stronger pepper crust to contrast the flavourful fattyness. This dish is excellent. I actually can't wait to go back and eat it again. The flavor of pastrami, yet not as smoky as you would find in a NYC deli, as fatty and tender as can be, Oh and the tatses linger....into bedtime!! Not so good...Pastami burps. The rye spaetzle was great and I loved the sprout krout!!! Whole mustard seeds a nice touch!!   Chicken and Waffles : 3.75/5 - Really surprised! Loved the waffle. It was a touch small. Crunchy outside, soft middle full of flavour. The blue clover honey is not as fancy as some might think, quite common actually, none the less it is good. CPH may want to sub for a single pass amber. The almond butter was a nice touch. What I liked was the light crust on the chicken, and the chicken was moist, literally juicy.  Meatloaf 2/5 - Terrible. Dry with an over salty demi. Ho hum pot's and weak zuzchini. My wifes is better but I wont tell her! Sorry. The two star rating is becuse the portion size is enormous....which, had the meatloaf been good would have busted my gut. But there are some round eaters out there that would like to know that this brick o meat is for you.   Lamb Burger 4/5 - Really good. Cooked perfectly, charred a bit on outside with a nice juicy oink center. The Carrier for the beast was crispy, Warm, chewy and soft. Delicious!! Loved the fact that it was like a gyro sans gyro meat. Replaced with a hunk of charred lamb. Good Shit. The fries were great but the ketchup....thats a bingo bitch, what fun!  Duck Smoked 3.5/5 - Cooked perfectly!! Thats always a bonus. Thank you chef! Everthying seemed right here, just did not do it FOR ME! I have had much better but this was good. Definately got the flavour profile balanced. Loved the Kale! Eh...maybe I should bump this to a 4 star dish.  Pretty good.  Scallop and Grits 5/5 - Excellent ! I thought I was the only one who could truly execute a perfect tasting scallop. It is my pickest dish and one of the easiest to ruin. They were seared perfectly, cooked just right and all the oceanic, nutty, buttery smooth richness you want from a scallop was present upon first bite. The grits.....hands down the best part of my dinner. Thet were rich, roasty, corny and had absorbed the brine from the scallops almost turning this dish into a grit ala risotto. Weird, delis=cious with a a tongue ascerbic lashing from colas gastrique. Nicely done. I will be back for this soon!!  Overall a great place. Big on flavor, good vibe and it's nice to see the workers hanging out and helping out as if you were invited to a buddys house. They want you to be happy!! Good Shit!",

The waiter actually used the phrase \"You should consider getting something from the bar, we like to think of it as the engine that drives the restaurant...\" This comment was obviously uttered in the pre-shift meeting, I could not believe he actually said it.  The chopped salad was good (petite & tossed table side?), I ordered a microbrew and my date had an egg-white/lemon vodka drink - yeah apparently in 2011 protein is cool to mix into your cocktails.   Should have asked if they had egg-beater whites instead.  Both choices were interesting but not anything I would tell a friend about.  Trying way too hard on the drinks in my opinion, some of the ingredients are completely unnecessary.  Good luck pronouncing them or trying to pick out their flavors in your drink, you'll be baffled.    Entree for me was the lamb burger ($14ish) medium, it was easily med-rare and not spectacular. Came with some pretty excellent french fries and some pickled rare vegetables (rutabaga? pickled rutabaga. yes, it exists.). Date ordered scallops which were a bit chewy, not melty like the mid-$20 price tag would have indicated.  If you are trying to impress someone, you can try to go here and maybe you'll fare better...we might have just ordered the wrong things?  Tab was about $80 for two drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees. Boooo.  Booked the reservation on Yelp, bonus!",

Living in the area and traveling frequently, my husband and I eat out at fine restaurants all the time. So this review is based upon years of dining experience throughout our country... WE WOULD NOT RETURN!  The service was the only redeeming feature. The quality and food preparation was subpar and the portions were smaller than usual dinner servings. The appetizers were good but the dinner selections (we had 4 different) were just OK. We were hoping the desserts would be better. Our server recommended her 2 favorites but they were not worth the calories and we left half of each. The noise level was that of a Friday night bar happy hour - we could barely talk to our friends sitting across the table. Cowboy Ciao has the original menu because the chef started there and then moved to CPH. Skip Citizen Public House and go to Cowboy Ciao, especially if you are visiting and want a wonderful meal in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the service, 1 star for the inability to hear yourself think due to the loudness of the music and the terrible acoustics in this place.  We met some out-of-town relatives at CPH last night and were hoping to have a really good meal and catch-up conversation...but all we got was the really good meal.  The pork belly pastrami appetizer was superb, the entrees of pan-seared scallops, meatloaf and pork chop were amazing and the bread pudding for dessert was to-die-for.  So, absolutely no issues with the food.  But the noise level was ridiculous, even for a night-life kind of place.  We literally could not hear the person across the table.  Asked our waiter to turn the music off or at least down but his manager refused...so we had to scream at each for 2 hours.  We will go back but without guests.  Go for the food/food service but don't go thinking you're going to have any relaxed conversation...at least not on a Friday night.",

I had the short ribs cuz I make my own and always wanna judge the competition. Started with the pork-bun appy, this is 3/4 inch bacon fat, delicious if you can get over eating large chunks of bacon fat. Had the chopped salad too, its a salad with it's own facebook page enuf said.  My guests both had the filet. Loved it. I had the aforementioned short rib. Originally it appeared to be quite a large portion with 4x ribs, layer of fat, and a chunk of meat on top. After digging in I realized the \"chunk\" was really quite small and the only other meat in this dish was the tiny portion between the ribs. The flavor of the meat was quite lacking- supposed to be \"coffee braised\", the sauce provided was very sweet- apple- more along the lines of barbeque than typical braised short ribs. Not for me very disappointed..  BOTTOM LINE: Great overall experience. Short ribs fell short.",

    "text": "Ate here for Yelp Eats week 2011. The hubby and I were meeting up with my sister and her husband for dinner at 7pm but we arrived at about 5:30 (it is just down the street from where I work so it seemed a waste to go home first). So, we got to enjoy the full bar experience while we were waiting. The bartenders were super friendly and offered up a lot of great information about the drinks and the food menu. My hubby was very happy that they had Kiltlifter and the Four Peaks Hefe on tap and so was content to enjoy a couple of those but I decided to try the specialty cocktails since I had heard such good things about them. The first one I tried was like a vodka tonic but instead of the tonic they used a sparkling wine in it. I think it also had some orange flavor to it b/c it was served with a curl of orange peel on the rim of the glass. It was so fresh tasting and the bubbles tickled your taste buds so it made the perfect aperitif. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of it and it is not on the list on the website. We also ordered some rosemary nuts which were served warm and were absolutely delicious. Basically just fragrant nuts that were ever-so-slightly candied but they made the perfect light snack. I decided to try a more earthy drink next to go with the nuts so I ordered a Moscow Mule. I know others have raved about this drink but I really wasn't a fan. I liked the cool cup it came in and I loved the fresh cucumber and mint but the ginger beer that they use is just too bitter for me. I love the taste of ginger but this was just too peppery. The next drink I tried (yes, I like to drink, don't judge) was the Aviation and I have to say that this was one of the best cocktails that I have ever had. I am a big gimlet fan (with gin, not vodka) and so this had that nice sour flavor but extra complexity because of the cherry liqueur. It was nice and fruity without being too sweet. Just a really great cocktail and I think I enjoyed it even more because by then we had also ordered some of the bacon fat popcorn which was fantastic. Kind of felt a little guilty seeing all the bacon drippings at the bottom of the bowl but the popcorn itself somehow did not seem too greasy or soggy at all. This really is the perfect bar snack since it went equally well with my fab cocktails and my husband's beer.   Once our dinner companions finally arrived me moved to a table in the dining area. We all ordered off the Yelp Eats menu. My brother-in-law tried the chopped salad and it did not disappoint. My sister and I got the regular salad with different dressings that were both fabulous. I love the fact that they have some unique salad dressing options that are fresh made daily in house. My hubby got the sausage of the day which we had already been informed at the bar is sort of a salad, too. It was basically sliced Spanish chorizo (the hard kind) on top of mixed greens. I have never seen him enjoy a salad so much. For entrees, two of us got the scallops which were absolutely perfect. Really amazing. My sister got the chicken and my hubby got the pork. They were not as impressed as we were with the scallops but they still enjoyed their meals. We were all too stuffed for dessert but I got a cappuccino to sip on while my sister finished her wine and it was tasty though more of a latte since the milk was mixed in rather than floating on top.  I love the smooth, swanky feel of this place.  I was expecting more of a \"pub\" atmosphere because of the name but it is not like that at all.  I really like places like this that are upscale but not stuffy.  You would feel equally comfortable here in a dress and heels as you would in jeans.  I will say that if the meals weren't half off I may have felt it was a little overpriced.  I think I would have just given three stars based on the dinner but the drinks and service we received at the bar bumped it up a notch and I will definitely be back just for that reason.",

    "text": "While traveling to Scottsdale for a conference at the JW Marriott, we decided to venture off the resort to have dinner in Old Town Scottsdale.  Citizen Public House came highly recommended, and delivered a tremendously fun dining experience last night.  On a Wednesday night, Citizen was still pretty busy when we walked in around 8:30.  We were taken care of my Greg, who was one of most enthusiastic servers I've ever encountered, but he was a True service professional who really knew the menu from top to bottom, and talked about the cocktails, food, and dessert options with no difficulty, giving his appraisals as he went.  We started with the Char Siu pork tacos and Citizen's well-known chopped salad, which was mixed tableside by Greg.  I can see why people love the chopped salad, particularly with respect to its presentation, but the Char Siu tacos, while good, were less memorable.  For entrees we tried the evening special, a Bavette steak, the short ribs, and the venison loin.  The highlight for me was the venison loin, which was presented rare, exactly as ordered.  Nice cold center but well seared on the outside.  The bavette steaks were not quite as successful.  Based on preferences at the table, one was ordered super rare (blue) the other was ordered medium rare.  However, both came out pretty similarly cooked (I'd call it rare), and in fact the one ordered medium rare seemed to be the one less cooked despite the fact that it came out a few minutes later.   We enjoyed the steaks nonetheless.  Finally, the braised short rib was well executed with a coffee rub, again not particularly memorable but still a dish we enjoyed.  I really enjoyed the cocktails and in particular their barrel aged options.  The Instant Gratification was a scotch-based cocktail with Cognac and Amaro, and it's pure alcohol.  Definitely a slow sipping cocktail.  I also enjoyed tasting the Manhattan, which was well-made.  Their wine list is reasonably extensive and has options in all price ranges. We enjoyed the 2013 Chappelet Mountain Cuvee for $45.  Overall, this was a tremendously fun restaurant that was enhanced by our excellent server, Greg.  While the execution on the food was a bit uneven, I'd give high marks for presentation, quality of cocktails, and ambiance.",

My husband got on a booking app & booked us an appointment at 3:00pm right away. We walked up to the door at exactly 3:01 & the door was locked. Another couple was sitting outside & said it was closed & they were waiting to get in also. At 3:05 we checked the door again & it was unlocked but no one came outside to tell us they had unlocked the door! (Weird...they saw us trying the door handle). The man who sat us at our table  argued with us about how they were booked!  To our waiters credit he was good but he was the only one running around & since they were \"booked\" until 9pm I would think they would have others waiters? After a long 2 hours the place NEVER filled up! There were probably 150 empty seats!! So I'm not sure why they made such a big deal out of them being booked up?!!   The food was good but over priced for what you got. The scallops were good but the price comes out to about $10 a piece. The chopped salad everyone made a big deal of was not that big in portion. It was good but for $14 I'll pass.  I ordered a vodka/tonic & it was as flat as a pancake!  We didn't care for the atmosphere as it smells like an old moldy building.   We had plans to come back with a group of friends but we'll pass on that too. Our meal was NOT cheap & I'd rather spend that kind of money at a restaurant that has better management with better attitudes.  I don't get it?",

We were very excited and loved the ambiance from the moment we walked in -- unfortunately that was the only thing we loved, and their seasoned fries. We were a table of 5 and seated right away, which was nice. But from the moment we got to our table we did not get a great vibe from our waitress. She wasn't very eager to answer questions or even serve us at all. I always had an empty glass of water, even though our whole table was ordering cocktails. Food: Extremely subpar from what we were expecting. We had the \"legendary chopped salad\" -- and no one ate it. It just sat on the table, untouched, and our waitress didn't even take a moment to ask if our food was okay. I mean, she just took it off the table completely uneaten. Then we ordered the burger, which was only eaten because we were starving. There was another salad ordered that was pretty bland, and the filet mignon tacos were cold and a let down.  Giving this place 2 stars only because of the decor. I'm sure this place is great to grab a few drinks, but would not recommend it for a dinner out with family -- there are so many other great places to eat in this area instead.",

Easily the most well deserved 5 star rating I have given out in 2015.  Save yourself the trouble of looking at the menu! Look to your skilled servers for advice and direction. Our server Sam was the sever that every restaurateur wishes they had. Polite, quick, and devoted to the menu. Sam directed us immediately to The Original Chopped Salad, a recommendation from a local friend sent us to the Bernie's Mac 'N Cheese - neither of which left me underwhelmed or with an empty stomach. To boot we finished off with the Heat of Caramel to drive home a winning experience.  The Original Chopped Salad: Everything you think you know about salad just died. This salad packs a seductive and savory experience that is nothing like any salad you have ever experienced. Select the smoked salmon and each bite will erupt in your mouth with sweet, tart, and smokey delectably unique taste. Deconstructed and prepared at your table this event is a must.  Bernie's Mac 'N Cheese: This is the type of Mac 'N Cheese your Mom would have made if she didn't suck at making Mac. Slathered in rich gorgonzola cheese topped with heaps of sweet grilled tomatoes, this is not like anything you have spooned into you gullet in the past year.   In short, you must go here be call yourself a truly enlightened foodie. Oh and by the way, dinner for two for a mere $40 including tip - I walked away stuffed, pleased, and eager for more. Bravo!  Back for a second night - I walk away pleased again! Encore!!",

It was even better than I remembered.  We then moved on to the fondue, which was also great. Who doesn't love cheese and bread?!?! And this was great cheese and great bread!  We had the scallops next, which, while small, were perfectly prepared and delicious.   The only disappointment was the deconstructed chicken pot pie. The chicken was amazing, but the rest of the dish was just OK. It wasn't bad, but I'd likely try something else next time.  We finished with the Heart of Caramel, which was a chocolate mousse cake, bourbon vanilla ice cream, a chocolate cookie and bourbon caramel sauce. Heaven.  Our server was great and helped us navigate the menu as we were putting together what we wanted to share. I had originally picked a cocktail, but expressed an interest in one of their barrel aged cocktails and he gave me a sip to try. Fantastic service all around and I was happy to come back and visit again!",

I went here because of yelp, was dying to try the salad which was amazing! The combo of flavors and textures is amazing. My mom hates fish, when I brought her here she got her salad with chicken, I gave her a bite of mine with the salmon and she's like wow that's good, I wish I got that! That's coming from someone who you'd have to force feed any type of fish. It was still good with the chicken but the smokey salmon flavor really adds to the salad. This specific trip we came here extremely dressed down, which I kind of expected weird looks or different service based on our attire (because most people are dressed up or in business attire), but the service was still amazing and the waiter even sat with us and asked if we had any questions about the menu. I love that we weren't treated different for being in shorts and a tank top.   Another visit I was having a bad day and came alone and sat at the bar, one of the waiters came over and said \"we were making drinks and made an extra one if you would like it.\" I'm not a whiskey fan but even that was good! I wish I got the name, it had a lemon peel in it, it's a drink on the menu. Very good and that type of little surprise makes for  an awesome experience and a returning customer :) made my day.  Here's some of the stuff I've ordered here:  -Tuna: it looks raw and has these little black dots on it, visually I was like, that looks gross, it was really good though, almost melts in your mouth.  -The crab cakes: these were sadly a disappointment, they were jalapeno crab cakes but they taste as if they had been frozen and were dry.   -The dessert with the sugar cookie: the house made whipped cream is really good but the mousse itself remind me of the dessert shooters at Applebee's, the cookie was really good though but overall not something I'd get again.   -Beer: most of the beers they have on tap are kind of men beers, a lot of dark or rich beers. I sampled a few beers but I didn't like them. I like pale ales, so not much selection there. Ended up getting a bottle of Stella that visit.  -Lemon drop martinis: they make them very good!  -Hummus: I don't like hummus but it was still good, the flat bread it comes with is very warm and delicious, the other sauce it came with was so good though, it's a white creamy sauce, don't know what it's called, but has a citrus-like flavor to it which I loved, I'd definitely order that again.   -The chopped salad of course is my favorite and would go again just for that!     Never had a bad time here. Look forward to my next visit.",

It was a really nice date night and also perfect for a group",

Citizen Public House was absolutely amazing!  We True the pork belly pastrami, chopped salad and I had the scallops for my entree.  Everything was absolutely DELICIOUS! We did a bit of research regarding the menu here before our dinner and originally thought, \"A chopped salad? Really? How much better can it be than the ones served everywhere else?\".  Boy, were we wrong! It was so worth it!  The pork belly pastrami was TO DIE FOR (ignore the fact that your cholesterol may shoot 50 points)! Hehe ;) The scallops were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.    Our server was very knowledgable about the menu offerings and even suggested a few areas around town that we might like to visit after our dinner.  He was super friendly and checked on us frequently throughout the night.    If I ever make a trip to Scottsdale again, I'll definitely be stopping by here again :)",

He knew the family sitting next to us by name and by their food order. We ordered the ramen, hush puppies and mussels from the happy hour menu. All were delicious! We also ordered a main course each; I ordered the scallops and my husband ordered the pork loin. Everything was cooked to perfection.

The roasted zucchini was tasty and the Yukon mash was a great portion size and complemented the meatloaf nicely.

Let me mention the service- it was a Sunday evening and not too crowded, our group of 6, I have to admit we were a pain in the ass.......we DID have reservations, 1/3 of our party were running late (OK, it was me).....CPH not a problem.    Then when we finally all get there drinks at the bar chit chatting away...our table is ready.  We don't want to sit there, we want outside....CPH not a problem.    Ok, so it was another 20 minute wait, now we are getting kind of hungry, so we sit at our original table and order appetizers, but wait 2/3 of the party still want outside sitting!!!   CPH not a problem.  An outside table for 6 is finally available so they move us (Ahhh....2 tables over), we get our appetizers and lucky for us we still get to keep our fabulous server and FINALLY the group is content.   The food was fabulous!  I love going out with foodie friends because we all ordered something different from the menu.  We started with the original chopped salad and pork bellies and they were delicious!  Dinner, we basically order everything from the pan seared scallops, buttermilk chicken, meatloaf the fish and short ribs were all excellent!  Everything was absolutely delicious.    Back to the staff & service, I have to say were all fabulous and so accommodating.  Bravo!  I can't wait to bring new friends to experience this place ......and I promise we won't be PITA's.",

    "text": "Located in Old Town Scottsdale, this gastropub has been one of my favorite restaurants due to their superb ingredients, consistency, originality, and service. The location is easy to miss on the street corner, and strangely I haven't had problems with parking in the amount of times I have been here.  They open in the late afternoon and dim the lights once dinner hours kick in. The interior is underscored by a full bar in the middle surrounded by rows of tables and booths dressed in white tablecloths and small candles. Even though the atmosphere gets loud later in the evenings, the venue is a nice date spot or small gatherings.  For appetizer, their Original Chopped Salad ($12) is a must get. The firm couscous, fresh arugula, corn, aged asiago, and smoked salmon was a delicious combination that gave pop and texture in every bite. I highly recommend it.  Among the entrees, I top two dishes are the Smoked Duck Breast ($28) and Roasted Buttermilk Chicken ($20). The Smoked Duck Breast comes with two thick cuts of duck breast served tender and medium rare. The pieces were very soft to cut into with refined seasonings to go nicely with the sweet potato hash and braised greens. I wished the sweet potato could be a tad sweeter for a change of pace, but the greens were fresh and delicious to couple with the succulent duck.   Kudos to the chef, I'm not sure how the Buttermilk Chicken came out so tender and full of flavor! It was served with corn-butter bean succotash, roasted Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, and pecorino Romano on top. The thick cut was grilled and impressively moist with a refined buttermilk flavor in the backdrop. It was simplicity mixed with complexity. This is a dish for those who do not like to take risks, but it's also one that will impress both foodies and non-foodies alike.   The Fair Trade Short Ribs ($30) came with coffee rub, dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree and seasonal veggies. The ribs lacked a desired smoky flavor, but it was nevertheless complex and cuts at the touch of knife. The ribs were moist, and the tangy and zesty cherry BBQ sauce gave it an added dimension. The parsnip puree round out the flavors to go in-between the meats.   The Lamb Burger ($13) came with Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion tzatziki, and fries with house-made ketchup. The lamb was tender, super moist, with a detectable seasoning and good lamb flavor. The soft rolls held the burger together nicely, but for a dish this good, the fries could come with a few innovative dipping sauces other than ketchup.   For dessert, I was not all that impressed with the Choco-Chile Bread Pudding ($10). The chili flavor could be more pointed to add to the scoop of tortilla ice cream and dulce de leche. The quality of the bread pudding was rather stiff, flavorless, and one-dimensional. I wished the bread pudding could have more flavors embedded, so it does not create a distinct separation between dull and rich flavors. Since the bread pudding came highly recommended by the server, I got the sense that dessert is not really their specialty.  Service was very friendly, responsive, attentive, personable and knowledgeable. My meals were always nicely orchestrated, and the servers were extremely knowledgeable about the menu. One time I had a two year old at the dinner table and they were very accommodating with everything he needed.   However, I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups. I tried to organize a large dinner and the person on the phone was not friendly and required a hefty minimum for drinks. Her requirements were quite unusual since I had organized many other dinner events at other restaurants in the past. Other than that, there's plenty to like about this place. I'd be happy to return to try their Happy Hour menu and other items such as the Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Mac n Cheese.  Thanks to fellow Yelper Kurdy S for finding this place!",

After recommending an aged barrel drink that was too strong the waiter gladly changed it out for another and when I was debating between two he brought a sample of one to help me decide. The only downside to the evening was that the food lacked salt and flavor. While the bacon reduction popcorn and mac and cheese sounded delicious it was disappointing once received. The staff quickly helped to remedy that by bringing us salt and pepper.  While this did help it was still disappointing that I finally found a mac and cheese that I was completely satisfied with.  I would still go back and try something else though because the place is amazing.",

With very low expectations I decided to try it.  Sat at the bar.  The bartender was very friendly and she explained the menu and drinks.  They had a great selection of premium Scotches.  They also had 5 barrel aged cocktails.  I tried the Pacific coast and it was awesome.  For my entree I had the lamb burger cooked at medium.  Wow was it good.  I actually wanted to order another one, but I resisted.  The burger came with fries and some pickled carrots.  You must try the lamb burger.  Service was exceptional. Both bartenders made the dinner experience pleasant.  Service is a big deal to me, and they did a great job.",

    "text": "All around outstanding dining experience. Our waiter, Sam was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly. Nice open casual dining area. I've heard many good things about this place, and let me tell you, the ratings are True. Very attentive wait staff. Never an empty water cup. Price was good for portion size and quality. Lets talk about food now!  Had to take advantage of the great happy hour prices. Ordered the Kilt Lifter Fondue, which was served with sliced pears, sausage and bread chucks. Large portions & very tasty.    We split the chopped salad with smoked salmon. Incredible mix of flavors, every bit was a perfect mixture of awesomeness. This dish is a MUST TRY.  I ordered the crab cakes app as my main dish. They were very good, perfectly cooked with no weird fishy taste. You can tell they are made fresh, not from frozen. Very tasty.  BF got the meatloaf. It was recommended to us by our waiter. Glad we listened to him, it was fantastic. Great flavor, you can tell they use high quality meat. There was a perfect amount of sauce and nice portion of potatoes.   We sampled the bread pudding and chocolate brownie. Both very rich and decadent. We did not try any of the cocktails, but the selection was huge. Maybe next time. Can't wait to come back.",

One of my best friends + her boyfriend are steak snobs and only eat steak at this restaurant. It was their birthday celebrations and they, of course, wanted dinner here before the party. The staff was so accommodating. They let me bring cakes for both of their birthdays (see photos) and checked on our group consistently the entire night. The manager is great friends with the couple so he made sure everything and everyone was well taken care of.   The food was extraordinary. I ordered the short ribs the first time and the filet mignon during our second visit. The meat was very tender and full of seasoning (unlike most steakhouses). The short ribs come with this cherry BBQ sauce that is something I've never experienced before - but perfected the meal. Also, I'm kind of hooked on their house drink called The Citizen... but it is one sneaky ass drink! It takes like candy and you feel like you're just drinking juice... then after 15 minutes, you're drunk.  Be mindful of the price of this establishment prior to your arrival. It's worth the amount but it is on the pricey side. If that's not an issue for you... go here and enjoy!",

Initially I thought it was fantastic and educational, it would've been nicer if he would've mentioned it was going to be $80 for a 1.5 oz pour. Totally get up-selling and making money, but that's a little shady. $20-30 would've been pricey but absolutely acceptable. Ringing it in, not mentioning but saying something to another bartender, then having that other bartender deliver the check hidden behind another check... shady. When I said something all I got was \"I didn't know,\" which obviously an erroneous statement after watching his interactions with his coworker and made the entire situation worse. No apology.  Takeaways: Don't sit at the bar. Don't order Clase Azul Anejo (though delicious.) Dinner and drinks at Barrio Queen was the same price as this drink. Don't expect an apology or a heads up when the staff ultimately knows they're going to take advantage of you. Shady.",

I highly suggest enjoying 'dessert' AKA: cocktails, where an amazing Mixologist will perform his magic in whipping up a delectable spirit.

Started off with a delicious cab (later followed by a decent zin), and this is perhaps why everything was so good. ;)  We had the chicken and waffles appetizer (gluten free!!) which was great. The chicken was very crispy without being dry or burnt. The server said they use rice flour in the batter which I didn't notice only that it was tasty. The waffles were made with oats and it was very good, as well.  Dinner was varied with spare ribs, scallops, filet, and roasted chicken. Everyone's dishes looked amazing. I thought the spare ribs were fantastic with the meat falling off the bone the second you touch a fork to it. I was not, however, sold on the parsnip puree. The flavor and consistency were odd.. I think the seasonal veggie was kale which was not a good combo for the short ribs.   For desserts we had the donuts and coffee, the black and tan pudding, and the browned butter brownie. Let's just say that with the exception of the black and tan pudding (there wasn't enough of the black and too much tan!) that the plates were cleaned.  All in all, a great meal and I would go again.",

The mixed salad (the one with its own Facebook page) was great. Awesome mix of things, with just enough meat to give it substance. The hummus was well prepared with tasty pita wedges. For the main course, the coffee-crusted short ribs are can't miss. It comes with a tart cherry sauce that sets the whole thing off.

The field greens and the cheese plate were both delightful starters.  The crab cakes were a little bit on the smaller side, definitely the lowlight of the meal.  The lamb burger that my gf and I split was juicy, flavorful and well cooked. The fries were great. Thin flat slices of the potatoes, very different from the other fries I've had.  Service was great.

My husband and I shared the chopped salad, mac & cheese, and heart of caramel. We were stuffed by the end and spent less than $20 per person! What a deal!  I have never had a salad as original as the chopped salad at Citizen Public House. The presentation is beautiful and the salad is tossed table side. I honestly can't describe it, you will just have to try it yourself!  The mac and cheese was made with Gorgonzola cheese and topped with a tomato chili relish. It is decadent with a hint of spice. Very filling!  The heart of caramel should be called death by chocolate. It has a great smooth texture and is served with salted caramel and white chocolate ice cream. What a great finish to the meal!  Had to go back a second time. Got the chopped salad, meat loaf, and butter cake. The meat loaf was good, but not great. The butter cake was really good, but a little small for the price. Still love this place!",

I have been wanting to try citizen for some time now, thanks to my yelp buddies, and was very excited that the time had come!  We made reservations for an early dinner before our show.  We arrived earlier than expected, no problem, they got us in right away.  Our server was quick, friendly, and knowledgeable.  He guided up through their specialty drinks and gave great menu suggestions.  We sampled a few of their specialty cocktails on happy hour, great drinks at a good price, and had the 'tender belly' bacon fat heirloom popcorn. I like that they list bar snacks and starters separately because this certainly isn't an appetizer, but its is a great bar snack.    I'd love to tell you what my husband had for dinner, whatever it was he liked it, but  you see my memory of the night is clouded by the memory of the decadent dream that is the Pan Seared Scallops.  Wouldn't you know, I had never had scallops before, well I have, but they have been raw, or just an ingredient in a pasta, I had been meaning to try them as the main course for awhile and boy am I glad I did. Scallops my friend, have been an underrated chorus girl in my life, but this dish gave them the chance to shine, and shine they did.  When given full billing they make you ashamed you had ever shoved them in the background in the first place. I will never again take scallops for granted.

I am not sure what it is about Scottsdale restaurants thinking they have to be snobby to people.  We ordered drinks from an un-friendly bartender and then waited another 20 minutes to even be acknowledged again!    The food was ok!  The bf had the berrimundi which he liked but wasn't wild about the side it came with.  I had the meatloaf, which was good.  The gravy and mashed potatoes had a great creamy flavor.  My sister had the lamb burger with fries that were cold and not very tasteful.  There is not much on the wine list either.  I probably would not come back here because I dont think it was worth the hour wait for the crappy service at the bar.  I would rather venture down the road to Olive and Ivy.",

We were in Arizona for Spring Training and wanted to try a bunch of local restaurants - we came upon this place on our last night and it was our best meal of the week!  We had the piggies and waffles as an appetizer - and even though we had chicken and waffles for breakfast, it was quite different and fantastic.  They used cornmeal for the waffle - with syrup to dip it all into - it was quite nice.  The food is really good here, they also have a lot of interesting drinks and pull a lot of ingredients from local resources.  The only downside was that it's located in downtown Scottsdale and there are Giants fans everywhere - so if you can handle the smell of those people (heh), it's worth it to check out a place like Citizen Public House.  By the way - we're A's fans - so they probably enjoyed having some classy gents in there for a change.",

In short, Cowboy Ciao on steroids, which probably isn't an accident since it is owned by the former executive chef of the latter.   As both a date venue and a group outing for both cocktails and a full meal it delivers:  - Moe'scow Mule (~$10): A heavily poured Moscow Mule in a stylized metal urn with cucumber set the appropriate tone - Pork belly pastrami ($13): Paternal favorite and juicy, smooth merger of dishes - The Original Chopped Salad ($12): Not as good as proper Burmese Tea Leaf salad but worthy as the closest thing I've ever had out of Western salad canon - Lamb burger ($13): Well-executed with delicious thick fries with homemade ketchup  I need to return if for no other reason than to try the Bacon Brittle. I failed in that mission.  Even my parents liked the place despite the New American-ness and it's unusual for us to agree on anything that isn't a steakhouse. If there is any negative, it is that it is a bit pricey but more worthy of the occasional splurge than most other choices I've tried in or above the range in the area. If I lived in PHX I'd be here as often as wallet and heart/stomach permitted.",

The first time I ate here was about 2 years ago during Restaurant Week and I wasn't all that impressed.

My personal recommendations are the Pork Belly Pastrami, The Original Chopped Salad (yes it's just like Cowboy Ciao, but it's still really friggen good), and the Beef Belly BLT (oh my gosh is this good...everyone at my table wished they had ordered this after they tried it).  Recommendations based on friends/family's experiences: Bernie's Mac 'N' Cheese,  Fair Trade Short Ribs, and the Pan Seared Scallops.  Also, a good tip if come during busy season (spring training) and can't get a reservation until late: come at 7pm when the \"secret\" upstairs speakeasy opens, and call to get on the list up there.  The drinks are AMAZING and they serve the full CPH menu.",

We waited an unusually long time for our dinner.  The waitress finally came over and said \"I just checked on your dinner because I felt like it was taking long and they are getting it ready to bring out\"....an additional 20 minutes later, our dinner arrived.   I was so looking forward to the duck that I have ordered at least three other times.  I guess I didn't read the menu closely because they changed the dish....and not for the better - instead of warm, creamy millet or grits under the duck - the duck sat on top of luke warm diced \"sweet potato\" hash that tasted like it had been prepared hours ago and not a cherry in sight.  Now an amazing dish is just average and I won't order it again.  One of our guest had the short rib and it looked as if it had sat under a light for a while - dry....he said it was ok.  I felt bad since I encouraged him to order that dish based on past experience.  The meatloaf was the only consistently good dish this time.   Then, since it was a special occasion, we ordered the chocolate brownie dessert....I love chocolate and brownies but this was over the top sweet - I had one bite - our two guest the same and my hubby finished it because he didn't want to leave it.  We will probably give CPH another shot to redeem this experience but it won't be for a while and I certainly won't order the duck if it is still prepared with the hash.",

I decided on the meat loaf because it was 3 different types of ground meat. It was a mid-range price at $20 considering the filet was $34.  I ordered a hummingbird and and later a heff. Both tasty selections. My friends got fancy cocktails, including a pomegranate infused mojito that inspired laughs.  The food was delicious. I asked him what the amazing sauce was and I believe he said it was a \"veal demiglaze (demigloss??). It was delicious. The sides of zucchini and mashed potato were filling.

Long known among locals for it's great blend of ambiance, great drinks and adventurous appetizers it's no wonder this was on our list of places to recommend.  Happy Hour has some unusual items on the menu, this is when I should warn you that your typical menu. Many of the appetizers come served in bell jars and are meant to be shared and explored. Looking for more standard fare, don't worry, all the regular appetizers are  1/2 off during Happy Hour as well and you can still find some signature items here to try also.  May we suggest the Tender Belly Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn? Once again remember that all regular appetizers are half off during Happy Hour. Dig yourself some comfort food? How about Chicken and Waffles? Buttermilk-marinated fried chicken on oat waffles covered in almond butter and blue clover honey. Another must try item on the menu is the Kiltlifter Fondue. It is served with bread, sausage and apple slices for dipping with those cute little forks. Yeah what's not to love about a great fondue?

From the first moment we were greeted to the moment we left the service was impeccable, the food and drink were top-notch, and the atmosphere is just very relaxed and puts you at ease.  We shared some of the dishes that folks repeatedly mentioned - pork belly pastrami, chopped salad, short ribs, scallops, bread pudding and the pudding jar - all washed down with a couple of kilt lifter ales and a couple of glasses of delicious wines.  Every single bite and sip was great.  Our server, Jeremy, and all the other staff did a wonderful job of pacing things, refilling glasses, etc., and we never felt rushed or neglected.  A must try if you're in the area.",

I like that look and, after feeling good about the reviews, decided to join three old friends for dinner.  Everyone is dead right about the chopped salad. Damn! I'm not a huge salad eater but I could have this one every day.  The perfect starter dish.  On to the main courses.  I had the Truffle Grilled Cheese sandwich. Meh. It was OK, not great.  Two of my friends ordered the filet mignon. One loved it, the other - not so much. She said it was OK but they smothered it with sauce. At $32 I'm not sure why you'd do that to a perfectly good piece of meat.  Another friend had the lamb burger. She said it was fine but probably would order something else the next time.  Bottom line - mixed reviews on the main courses - go for the salad!",

Called in advance to inform them of my allergy and request that they simply change their gloves and use clean cutters when touching my food to ensure that I don't get sick on my special night. The waiter raised his voice at me and said that he could write it on the paper but wasn't sure if those preparing the meal would actually change their gloves, that they were too busy to care. He probably didn't realize he kept spitting on me when he spoke, he was so animated about it. I explained that it was my birthday that day and that I had called in advance. I had all my guests seated and didn't know how I could eat there if I couldn't trust them to honor basic food preparation guidelines for those with allergies. He continued to insist that they get too many orders and may not follow these guidelines. When my friend began getting upset and asked him to just make sure that it happens, he yelled \"what did you say?!\" in an extremely rude manner. By then there was no way we could order there and risk getting sick or trusting the food he brings out. All 8 of us walked out and had to find a new place for my birthday dinner at the last minute on a Saturday night. Would definitely NOT  recommend this place. Such a shame that they turned away our business, spoke rudely to us, and even didn't apologize for their behavior even after I informed the receptionist that we were very offended by the way we were treated by their server. So disappointed.",

When my husband and I went out last night,I was super disappointed to see they got rid of it so I ordered the Highlands Drifter and I was not disappointed. Not as awesome as the Sangria but it was tasty.  Our dinner and service was fantastic. I ordered the Chop Salad with smoked salmon which is consistently good and the Cauliflower Salad, as an appetizer. The Cauliflower Salad was a little bland in some (few) parts but overall very good. My husband said his \"meat was perfect\". One knock is their menu is a bit small, but man, they do NOT disappoint in their meat and veggies! So vegetarians and carnivores and pescatorians can all love each other and get along at Citizen! I love to end on a sweet note, you cannot go wrong with their Heart of Caramel dessert. If you're looking to trash your New Year's resolution to eat fewer sweets, do it. New Year's resolutions are an exercise in futility anyway.Wowza! My mouth is watering just yelping! One final point, our service has consistently been awesome. Our waiter was quick and when the kitchen was backed up due to a party of 30, he let us know they were running a little behind.  Four stars because they ditched my favorite drink but I will be back!",

Then for dessert we had the dude jar, which was good, but rich. By far the superior dessert was the heart of caramel. Bradley made sure that the service was spot on.

I can't stand this in restaurants.  Especially if one is conducting business.    The servers were very accommodating.  I enjoyed their hospitality.  They brought out a perfect Guinness.  They were always ready with refills and suggestions.  We were provided with some very good bruschetta and even better chicken pesto kabobs while we waited for the entres.  But here is the rub.  We had a limited menu with 5 selections.  It took almost 90 minutes to get our food.  They had several other parties.  I do not know why they did not have additional staff.  But this is pretty inexcusable.    I will say that the scallops were exquisite!  They melted in your mouth.  The corn grits were also delicious although there could have been more grits on the plate.  Come on folks grits are $2 for a tractor trailer load.  How about an adult 3/4 cup portion?    Finally, they had some unidentified green on the scallops.  It did nothing for the meal except remind me of baling hay in high school.  This did remind me that I went to school to pay prices like these!?!",

This version was the best though...smoked salmon, sunflower seeds, large couscous, sweet corn, arugula, tomato, and the creamy basil dressing is better than everyone else's...i'm guessing the ingredients may vary depending on what is fresh and available.  The bar staff was friendly and made me feel comfortable dining by myself.

My boyfriend had the crab cakes last time we were here, and I recall them being a bit of a miss.  The drink menu has something for everyone from cocktails and beer to a complete wine list.

    "text": "I have Mixed feelings on Citizen Public House. I truly want to love it more than I do and because if that I've been here about 3 different times. I almost wish I could write two seperate reviews. If I were writing this simply on the drinks the service and the atmosphere I would give them a solid 5 stars. I just feel like for me, the food is a hit or miss.   The first time I came in was for my boyfriends birthday. We eat out almost every meal and were so excited to try Citizens public house. I had called before hand to make the reservation and they seated us in a great location.  The service was top notch. I dont remember our servers name but he was fantastic. We ordered three smaller plates to share and every thing was just ok.   The Chop Salad: Our server told us we had to try it. This is something that they are known for. We both thought it was good but not overly fantastic. I honestly expected more. Presentation wise it was really pretty  The Kilt Lifter Fondue: So-So once again not overly impressed. The idea of fondue is fun but i wanted just a little more.   The Truffle Grilled Cheese: They honestly need to take this off the menu. It is aweful. It tasted like someone just put a huge mass of potatos on bread and called it a day. DO NOT ORDER THIS.    PB&B Pudding jar: Yum im a fan. Im a sucker for anything with caramel and bannana and this hit the spot.   I dont remember the drinks we ordered but they were all great. They know what there doing behind the bar.   We left that night a little dissapointed. I still left the server a great tip because he was awesome and deserved it but I wish the food had reflected the service.   Ok So now for EXPERIENCE #2:  I came in with a girlfriend for restraunt week and had a Fantastic time. We were seated in the same great place as before. Our server this time wasnt as great as the guy Id had before but he was a gem. They have somewhat of a pr-eset menu for restraunt week so heres what we ordered:   Squash soup: Not always on the menu. It was a little bland but over all good. Its hard to make butternut squash soup pop. I was happy.   The Pan Seared Scallops: OH MY GOSH YUM. These scallops are fantastic!!! The corn grits they are served on are to die for and the cola gastrique is Awesome. This dish is killer and I would come back for them. I even ordered them at thei sister restaurant the gladly.   Amaro Meatloaf: The meatloaf was huge!! I only tasted one bite because it was my friends but she loved it and the bite I took was great as well. Tasted as good as moms meatloaf!! The only quam we had with this was My friend had asked to switch the veggies it was served with and our waiter just  flat out said no. She could have at least asked the kitchen for us.  PB&B Bread Pudding: I feel like it was different than the first time id had it. Maybe not in a jar? Still good though!!  Now for the drinks: The Sangria here is the Bomb. I dont know what they put in it but man is it good. I also love the Citi-zen cocktail. So Yummy! and they put a rock candy stir stick on top which is so cute!!!  Iv'e also been in before just to sit at the bar for drinks no food and the experiances are always good. Like I said before the guys behind the bar know their stuff.  Alright so I have mixed feelings, One Blah experience and one great experience. Im conviced that the main courses here are all awesome and we just oredered the wrong items the first time so I still reccomend this place to people. I really Want To love Citizen Public and there are parts of it that I do.",

Had the chopped salad and it was full of flavor, but didn't leave me wanting more.  In fact, we stopped ordering after it and left before we had a meal.  I can't put my finger on exactly any one thing, but didn't feel inclined to stay.  The waitress lacked culinary instincts and seemed interested to \"sell\" rather than guide us to what would interest us.  Overall, I wouldn't come back with all the other amazing options in old Scottsdale.",

The selection is all done very well as are the cocktails and wine selection. The fact that they have a late night bistro menu is always a big plus to me as I enjoy a little finer dining and eating on my weekend evenings as opposed to swilling back metric tons of bud light to get my kicks.  GO, and enjoy one of Scottsdale's higher tier restaurants for the casual diner.",

I had the Persian this time around.    The chicken and waffles had good flavor.  Loved the seasoning on the chicken and it was cooked just about right.  There was one piece that had a bit of wet batter but for the most part it was well worth the 10.  4 large pieces of chicken on top of a smallish square of waffle.  It was actually way better than Lo-Los and probably about the same price!  I tried some of the filet mignon, duck and scallop entrees.  Loved the combinations, especially the filet and the scallop - wasn't sure about the risotto that came with the duck.  The glazes for the filet and scallop was very good as well.  All in all, the prices are kind've high but reasonable for the product and experience they bring.  I would love to come back to try the rest of the menu!",

    "text": "Service was good. The server can really sell and explain the menu items if you are new.   Now, the food.   Started with the bone marrow and a serving of oysters.  Oysters are the size of your thumbnail. It's the smallest I have ever seen and its ridiculous that we were paying what was essentially just shells. It had a Tabasco sauce that may as well be straight Tabasco.   The bone marrow was nothing to write home about. Growing up, my family made pho often and the marrow from the beef bones for the broth were more flavorful and plentiful. It's not worth it.   Entrees were lamb and chopped salad.   Lamb was supposed to be med rare but came out exceedingly rare. Like straight red throughout. Admittedly the portion size was good but you do pay quite a bit for it. It comes with a small side of plain arugula and softened peanuts or something. The accompanying sides were not too enjoyable. It's very rich overall. I think it could have came with rice or potatoes or something. My date couldn't finish it. Too rare.   The chopped salad was what I got and it was very good. The pictures posted made it look bigger than it was but it is a salad so it's okay. I enjoyed it and would come back for that. It's a reasonable price too.   So all that plus a glass of wine came to over $80. Yikes! Just don't get too adventurous with the starters like we did.",

    "text": "Came in with friends for cocktails.  Marian and I tried the Pyrat Eye for $5 each on the happy hour menu. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/citizen-public-house-scottsdale?select=qP8gnrbtP8N9BMaFlGh6vA#qP8gnrbtP8N9BMaFlGh6vA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/citi...</a>  Others had a Negroni HH special, a glass of pinot noir (half-off during HH), and Boulevardier (also $5 on HH).  I did not really like the dark rum cocktail.  The scent reminded me of rum and coke, which I never cared for when I tried it many, many years ago, and when I took a sip, did not get the satisfying cola taste at all, and instead came away tasting very bitter dark rum.  It certainly wasn't as unpalatable as I make it sound, since I did finish half of it.  I just wasn't a fan.  If you're all about getting drunk fast though, then this might be a drink for you!  Next time, I'll just stick to wine.  When I felt the buzz coming on after only a few sips, I decided to go with the table bread that everyone had passed on earlier.  This prompted orders of Kiltlifter fondue and bacon popcorn from everyone else-- so happy!!  The cheese fondue paired the best with the toasted cubes of bread, although I skipped on the pear that Chrissy P. was loving!  (Pear doesn't like me very much.)  We all raved about the farmer's sausage from Shannon's (sorry, forgot the whole name).  The spice level was perfect!  Wished there were more slices on the plate!  I skipped on the popcorn (corn allergy), but I did try a sliver of bacon-- it was floppy, not crispy, so I left it on my plate.  The warmed, but not toasted, table bread was good, and paired only with a tiny cup of extra-virgin olive oil.  I was hoping for butter, but the EVOO did have a great, mild flavor with slight buttery notes when consumed with the bread.",

Cocktails are the bomb -- definitely try the spicy Thai margarita.  Don't miss the original chopped salad (which has its own Facebook page). It really is special.

    "text": "We made reservations for Valentine's Day and because of the popularity of this place could only get at 3 pm reservation. We did not eat breakfast or lunch and arrived very hungry. To our dismay there was a pre-fixe $60 per person menu and no other options and we were not warned of this when we made our reservation on Open Table. Since we did not know the menu prices well enough we didn't realize that for the majority of the selections one was getting seriously ripped off at the $60 per person price. We should have left but we so much wanted to eat there because the regular menu sounded so great and we were so hungry that we stayed.   The appetizers were smaller versions of regular appetizers that normally cost $7 to $12, the entrees were between $20 and $34 and the desserts were about $10. Only if you got the $34 filet mignon were you anywhere near the $60/pp price which of course did not include tax or gratuity. For those of us that ordered the meatloaf we paid about $15, maybe even $20 too much for our meal.  That being said we thoroughly enjoyed our cocktails and food and our server AJ was fantastic. He engaged us when we gave him details about our activities earlier in the day and he had very sound suggestions on the menu. We did return the next day without a reservation and sampled the regular menu.   We ordered the Citi-Zen (a vodka, lemon martini basically), a Manhattan, the Thai Margarita and The Import that had whiskey, a stout float and a smoked sugar rim. The two best were the Citizen and the Manhattan (crystal clear - no shaking!) with the Import third and the Thai Margarita not balanced and too sour. The next day we had happy hour drinks - a Bouvedier (sp?) sort of like a Manhattan which was very good and the regular menu Pleasantville which although AJ did not care for our party thought was very tasty - maybe a little floral.  Here's what we ate on both nights:  Curry Caulilower soup - has a good kick of spice to it from the curry oil - delicious.  Chopped salad - excellent. The freeze dried corn gives nice crunch and flavor. It is presented in little piles in the bowl so that you can see all of them clearly before you mix it all together yourself.   Pastrami brussels sprouts - the rye spaetzle \"sticks\" were dry and strange, the rest of the dish was great.  Fondue was good, not great - it seemed a little thin in flavor.  Scallop entree was amazing.  Pork and beef meatloaf was a very large portion and satisfying, it needs more of the porcini mushroom drizzle.The mashed potatoes under the loaf were chunky as well but not overly buttery.  Fair trade short ribs - absolutely amazing! Tender, full of flavor and not fatty. Cherry barbecue sauce was a little overwhelming for it.  Pork shank - tender and good flavor but not amazing.  Lamb burger - very strong flavors, roll too chewy, french fries are the bomb, so good and crispy!  AJ had recommended the Filet Mignon and after seeing it land on another table we regretted it not ordering it as it appeared to be a 10 ounce (or more) portion that was over 2 inches thick and perfectly cooked!  Dessert was duo of flourless chocolate cake (with a teaspoon at most of a salted caramel sauce that was great) and a heart shaped red velvet cake. They were okay but a little bit of a let down to end a Valentine's day meal.",

    "text": "What a cool place! It's an upscale pub and refreshingly versatile. If you wanted to come with a few friends and have bar food, it's great. If you want to come with a big group, it's a fun, loud atmosphere. But somehow there is something very romantic about it - I'm not sure if its the dim candle-lit mood or the way that you just feel in your own world, but you can have a very intimate dinner right in the middle of it all and not even notice.  The food is delicious!! I had the BEST GRILLED CHEESE ever. High quality cheese and bread, and white truffle scented mashed potatoes! Mmmmmmmm. The crabcakes are delicious and the short ribs were excellent! The catfish was also delicious but it's pretty spicy, so be aware. It's a little on the pricier side, but you're in the middle of downtown Scottsdale with great ambiance and very good food. Definitely makes for a special night.   4.5 stars so I'll round up!",

The meat was tough so his teeth ended up hurting from all the chewing. Service was decent but the price was high. Food is not terrible, but I think there are definitely better options in the area.",

Citizen Public House did impress, though.   We arrived around 7pm on a Sunday night and didn't think we would need reservations. The wait wasn't long (20 min), but I would suggest reservations.   We started with the Mac and cheese with tomato relish. I can't say enough good things about this dish. The Gorgonzola gave it a slight tang, and the tomato relish blew my mind.   I had the scallops and my date had the rack of lamb. I'm not a fan of lamb, but he said it exceeded his expectations. The scallops definitely exceeded mine. They were plump and cooked to perfection. The plating was both beautiful and delicious. I am recommending this place to all of my family in the area.",

    "text": "Enjoyed Every Bite!  Hubby and I found this place and made a reservation on OpenTable about 45 minutes before we showed up.  We were a bit early... but they sat us right away.  Kristen our server was super nice and very efficient. We had a few different people helping us.  And the water guy was ninja-like... our water glasses were never empty.  Thank You, Ninja Water Guy!  We were parched after being in the sun and running around outside most of the day.  This place is a higher end type of place. \"White table cloth\" .... really it's white butcher paper on top of white table cloth.   The ambience is lively.... kinda noisy in fact.  So, if you are looking for a peaceful, romantic dinner for 2.... go some place else.  The service and food are top notch. We were in and out in about an hour... and we never felt rushed nor did we feel like we ever had to wait for anything.  We ordered a bottle of wine, a salad to share and 2 entrees... our bill with tax and tip was $134.... not cheap... but I felt it was worth the price considering the quality and taste of everything.  They start you off with bread bites and olive oil.  Good soft bread with really good olive oil that was medium bodied and had a nice flavor to it... not just a regular plain olive oil.  I thought it was a bit earthy with notes of grass and herbs.  We shared the Chopped Salad and it was just the right size for the 2 of us to start with.  It had Israeli CousCous and pumpkin seeds in it which are different and struck just the right notes to change up an otherwise plain salad into a tasty salad with different dimensions to it.  I enjoyed the Scallops on a bed of creamy polenta.  I pretty much licked the plate.  The Scallops were succulent and sooooooo good!   Hubby had the special which was a cashew encrusted halibut.  His too was tasty but the bed of (I think) rice had a spicy kick to it that was good but was just a bit too empowering for me.  Definitely a nice place to go to for dinner, and I'd put this on our \"Let's Go Back Again\" list.",

I went with one of the bourbons. It was potent and tasty. Paired well with the bacon popcorn  - Bacon popcorn: hub awarded this the best thing he ate during our time in Scottsdale. Pieces of bacon plus tossed in some bacon fat. Could get a bit greasy but flavor was great and surprisingly not too in your face. 4.5 stars - Salad: never heard of a more hyped salad--has its own Facebook page and all--but it was very good. Think why it stands out is the variety of textures: dried corn, pumpkin seeds, little date pieces, Israeli cous cous, and arugula leaves. Another standout flavor was the marinaded tomato pieces. Default was salmon but we went with chicken and enjoyed it. 4.5 stars  - Scallops: solid version with good sized scallops cooked well. Velvety layer of grits were delicious with it. 4 stars - Dessert: caramel filled mousse cake and chocolate biscotti with ice cream was decadent. 4 stars - Irish coffee: excellent version with just the right amount of froth, sweetness, and cream - Atmosphere: lively room with a square bar in the center of it all. - Staff: everyone was friendly, knowledgable, and on the ball - Gluten free options: so many of the menu items were noted as gf which was nice to see  Midlights: - Short ribs: bit dry for my taste. 3 stars  Lowlights:  - Didn't have room to try the sandwiches: they looked really good   Best dinner we had this trip and I'd come back for sure.",

    "text": "We came to Citizen during a vacation to Scottsdale. We made a reservation, which I recommend doing - it was busy in there!  We arrived early for our reservation, and had a drink at the bar to start. I was DD, so I just had a soda water (womp woooomp), but my pals had some fancy cocktails, which they loved, though they did seem a bit pricey.  Seeing the bartender made me really happy because he was clearly living his best life, loving his job, and being an all-around awesome human. Bearded bartender, if you can see this, you're great!  The host saw us to our table, and this isn't the kind of place that forces you to settle up with the bar before you go to your table, which I appreciated immensely. We were seated inside near the patio, but it was quite chilly. The host had no problem finding us a new place to sit. She was incredibly nice and accommodating, and it was clear that our comfort was important to her.  Our server was a friendly fellow who made some good recommendations. On his recommendation I had the scallops on polenta and it was delicious, but again, pricey.  The bathroom had a candle that smelled like cake.  This place lost points with me because it was super duper loud, and we found it to be a bit slow. It was also maybe a bit pricey for what it was.   I wouldn't object to coming here again, but it may not be my first recommendation.",

Wife ordered the salmon special, which had a harissa puree and cucumber couscous. I ordered the ling cod, we both agreed this was the best of the two. The pickled papaya and hazelnuts/beurre blanc were such a unique combo that played really well together.  Dessert was also delish, though not really the reason to come here. The cocktails and entrees are where it's at.  Side note, the two cocktails we ordered we're awesone. I got a Manhattan, which is probably the first I've had with tobacco bitters and maple syrup (holy smokes, no pun intended). The lady got something with gin, citrus, cucumber, and elderflower liquer. Totally different than mine, but very tasty as well.  Overall, highly recommend either In Good Spirits restaurant, honestly. Elevated dishes with a unique twist and great service. Will be back!",

    "text": "I rounded UP to 3 stars because, and solely because, of the chopped salad - definitely the best salad I've ever had at a restaurant.  Now that I've gotten the only redeeming quality of CPH out of the way (our server was pretty good, too), let's discuss the negatives:  1. The tap water is nasty. I work in downtown Phoenix. The water downtown tastes like the CPH water... in desperate need of filtration. At my workplace, we use Sparklett's delivery because the water is unpalatable. CPH needs to address this issue at once, especially since, as I read in an earlier review, CPH apparently won't let you bring in \"outside water.\" So, you're forced to drink swill prettied up in a silver pitcher, or buy a drink (it would be ironic if they had bottled water for sale).  2. The pork shank was REALLY porky, and REALLY smoky, and the fingerling potatoes were way overdone. By the third bite, the dish was no longer enjoyable.  3. It's 2016. Foie gras and veal?   4. If you look at their online menu and think, geez, can the prices get much higher? The answer is yes. Yes they can. And they just recently rolled out a new menu with new prices - they haven't even updated their online menu yet. Their meatloaf is $2 more, chicken dish is $4 more, and that incredible chopped salad is $1 more.  I would come back for the chopped salad over and over - but maybe I'll try it at the Gladly (CenPho tap water is much easier on the palate).",

The hostess couldn't hear us when we checked in for our reservation and had to walk into the hallway to hear us. Our server couldn't hear us well when we ordered. And what should have been a 5 minute wait turned into a 25 minute wait. Why bother making a reservation?   I had Bernie's Mac and Cheese. It was just ok. Husband had the meatloaf..that too was just ok. Dining out is a full experience though. It's not just about the food. It's about the service and ambiance too. The service was just alright..but again, it was so frickin loud that the ambiance is totally ruined and I think that also effects the service because there is an air of disinterest in the service staff and hostesses that was palatable.   I get that it's a pub. That said, you can't charge what CPH charges for food and expect people to have to shout at each other during the experience. We won't be back. It's not worth it.

Asked the bartender what was better between a couple drinks and and he starts harping on me about subjective taste for a min before he actually starts acting like a bartender and starts actually exposing the drinks.. no I don't expect you to know my taste just know you are the bartender and should have tried both drinks and can give a subjective ( not objective) opinion on how I may perceive enough the drinks.  This did not happen, but if I ask what is good.. again I am not expecting you to know my taste, but rather giving you an opportunity to showcase your skills, maybe you make something you think is just killer, maybe you make something everyone loves... tell me about it! Don't try and make me feel stupid because you chose a profession. Of answering questions! Take that moment to showcase what you have, what you know! The drink was good just not as enjoyable when you feel patronized! I'll find my next drink else where!  One suggestion on the drink! Torch the peel a little and rub it in the glass.   It will bring out the oils a flavors a little more!",

It was  a nice  location out of the heat on the patio, and quieter than the big dining area.       We got there at the end of the Happy Hour and tried the Artichoke (soooo tender), and the Bone Marrow with Ricotta Pancakes (pancakes were great rolled around the marrow but there was very little marrow to share).   The Grilled Peach Salad sounded very good and it was different so we both ordered that.    We were disappointed and we provided feedback to our waiter.  The peaches were not ripe.  They were too hard and lacked flavor.   (More on this below).  For our main courses my husband had the Pan Seared Scallops (which he loved) and I had the Flat Iron Steak (very good!)   Partway through our meal our waiter showed up with  the chicken version of their famous chopped salad to make up for the disappointing peach salads.    I had told him earlier I wasn't fond of smoked salmon so he had one made with chicken instead.       OMG!  I could not stop eating it.   It was delicious and full of different tastes and textures.    We topped off the meal with the Heart of Caramel dessert.  We were already stuffed but couldn't pass up trying a dessert (good!).  We will be back.",

We were greeted as soon as we walked in and sat (as requested) at a nice table outside. The decor and atmosphere was fun, eclectic, and welcoming.  Our server stopped over within a minute or two and took our drink orders. After a little deliberation and a few well answered questions from our server, I ordered the truffle grilled cheese and he has the lamb burger. The truffle grilled cheese was extremely tasty. The onions on it were cooked perfectly and the truffle flavor was distinguishable, but not overwhelming on the other flavors!  The side salad had some delicious berries and cheese topped with a light balsamic that made a winning combo.  Despite being relatively stuffed already, we just had to try the brownie dessert with caramel sauce.  The only things that could have made this delectable delight better - warm that baby up before topping it with the ice cream! It was however, devoured as it was, so obviously it wasn't a loss by any means.  Our server was friendly and wonderful from start to finish - he made (good) recommendations, checked in regularly, and made us laugh.  Overall: A When we are back in the area, this is definitely on our \"do again\" list!",

I cannot rave enough about this place: it's unpretentious, reasonably priced, AMAZING food. Here's a TIP: order appetizers. You'll save a lot of money and that's where the chef's really show off. The chop salad is, of course, amazing. And the Mac & Cheese WILL be the best you've ever tried.  As for entrees, the bacon-wrapped scallops are my favorite that I've tried. The desserts here have been known to make my friends and I cry from emotion. I'm not kidding, my best friend had a brownie that actually brought tears of emotion to her eyes.  I highly recommend Citizen Public House. I love that they always change their menu and I can't wait to go again.",

Things came out relatively quickly, the atmosphere was spot-on, there wasn't a wait for us, and it wasn't too busy.   But my expensive hamburger was enormous and difficult and not in the deliciously messy way but in the \"this is frustrating to eat for it not tasting completely amazing\" way. The popcorn was expensive popcorn, with a bit of bacon grease flavor. Does what it says on the tin. The mac and cheese was quite good. The drinks were... interesting, and ran the gamut from awkward and overpowering to delightful, all the standard $9 or so. I think we skipped dessert.  My guests enjoyed their meals quite a bit more (though the drinks thing was everyone having a sip; I had tea.)  Overall, a 3, maybe 3.5 star experience. I'll go back and give it another go, but I wasn't filled with a sense of wonderment. (And I tried other dishes than just the burger, naturally.)",

    "text": "A wonderful, delicious respite in Scottsdale.  Visiting for Spring Training and disappointed by our first night's meal at Papago Brewery, we were excited at the anticipated visit to Citizen Public House. We were not let down. One of those wonderful places that make you struggle to select from a delectable menu, both food and drink.  The cocktail list is inventive and inviting. The New Amsterdam was intoxicating in a good way. Complex and delicious, deftly made with obviously excellent ingredients. The only hiccup was a bespoke order for a Basil Mojito, very simply replacing mint with basil that was made (twice) without any obvious effort to muddle the basil. A disappointment that was removed from the invoice. The food is spot on, creative and very well thought out. Started with the sublime Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn and intriguing Pork Belly Pastrami. A flavor packed, beguiling, complex offering served over rye spaetzle and brussel sprout sauerkraut. Big and bold but well designed. Entrees across the table included the Amaro Meatloaf and two Lamb Burgers. The Meatloaf was big, earthy and warming. A generous serving, worth the sporty $20 tariff. the veal demi-glace and mushroom cream delivering a rich arc, while the potatoes and roasted zucchini supplied the ideal sweep for the meatloaf. Lamb burgers were excellent with an exotic compilation of Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion, tzatziki. Enough so that a request was made to attempt replication at home. Dessert for the table was the PB&J Pudding Jar. Joyous companions all! The service was very friendly and attentive while not overpowering, knowing just when to service the table. Excellent. The space is warm, yet hip and airy, with a very manageable noise level. It was nice, for a change to visit a very popular restaurant that didn't have tables stacked on each other. Very refreshing.  A highly recommended spot for an Old Scottsdale visit..in fact for a destination as well.",

The room is welcoming, cleanly styled and has a personal touch to it typically lost in the Scottsdale restaurant scene. Sit bar top and be treated to one of the expert mixologists creations. If you're lucky partner/mixologist Richie Moe will be experimenting behind the bar with some of his crazy equipment (certainly not meant for bartending, but making tasty libations none the less!) and let you sample the results. Be sure to sample to Bijou and Sazerac - both traditional cocktails given due reverence here.  The staff is pleasant, warm, knowledgeable and professional. Nuff said.  The food. Be sure to sample the Pork Belly Pastrami, the Scallops, and the Mirliton Chop Salad. This isn't a suggestion, it's a demand.   Overall a great addition to Old Town Scottsdale!",

    "text": "I went with another Yelper who had gone to the Yelp event at Citizen's, however, we didn't have the same experience as she had at the Yelp event.    We had cups of iced tea (Starbucks)  that the hostess didn't say we couldn't bring in, a server just came by and was about to take them until we asked why..  I asked how a particular drink was..was it sweet, the waitress said it was more savory which I thought well it sounded good..umm skip the Aviation, even had my friends try it and they too thought I should send it back however I got the feeling that I would be charged for the drink and charged again for whatever else I ordered, so I let it sit on the table and see how long it would take the waitress to notice..never did..another server/busboy came by to take my plate, and I just told him to take the drink, he never questioned nor asked what was wrong..all in all poor service.  We had the mussel chowder..skip it!  The 8 mussels makes the bowl look full, underneath, hardly any leeks and potatoes but a lot of celery! And the chowder was really runny. And for $9, seriously for mussels which are one of the cheapest seafood to purchase.  When I was going to the restroom, I noticed to ladies totally bored and annoyed, just sitting side by side with just water in front of them.  I thought to myself, have they been served or asked??  I walked back out and they were out the door pretty quickly.  Would I go back? Umm..no..the pricing of the food is similar to Fez and other foodie spots and reasonable, however the quality and the quantity not so much....oh..and the service..I've had better.",

Then head over to CPH and order a properly made moscow mule and some bacon fat popcorn to get started.   I really have nothing but good things to say about this place. I have had the pork belly, the filet, the burger, gourmet grilled cheese, hummus, and a few more things. The temperature, portion size, flavors, and prices on everything have been spot on.   For those of you who are in to the current trend of supporting local and smaller business ventures, I found out that this place was started by a couple of local service industry guys along with Chef Bernie. Bernie uses tenderbelly pork and *Smart Chicken chicken. I googled both to find out why he chose these companies. The deserts are made by a local women and sold at the restaurant. They do change occasionaly.  Chef Bernie is also the creator of the famed \"Stetson Salad\" going by the name \"Original Chopped\" at CPH. Anyone who is from Scottsdale is probably aware of the popularity of this single item. So if you have friends visiting from out of town, or you are visiting yourself, this is a local fave.  I recently had a bartender friend tell me \"I'm so tired of hearing the term mixologist\". It may be overused, but this bar can probably get away with it. I am mainly a wine drinker, but they have a long list of really unique cocktails on the menu and I notice a few new ones added every few visits. Richie is one of those guys where you can say \"i had something that was like blah, blah, blah, but have no idea what was in it\" and he will probably figure out what you are talking about even when you aren't quite sure.   The last good thing I will say is liking CPH on FB is worth it. I notice many places that never seem to update anything. CPH is very good about keeping you in the loop about the daily special, deal, and new dishes.",

My experience so far is that I'm a huge fan of everything on the left side of the menu (small plates, apps, salads,etc). It's not that the sandwiches and entrees (only tried the roasted chx) weren't nicely prepared, but they just aren't to my taste. Too much flavor, or not enough. Not a fan of their fries.   Their wine selection is fantastic. There is a great range of varietals and price points to choose from.  The service is wonderfully friendly! All the staff that I've encountered are very knowledgeable about the wines and the menu.  Lastly... the owner is cute! Had to say it.",

Everything was spot on from the moment we walked in the door- the hostess was delightful and welcoming, our server explained the cocktail list, and off we were. The cocktails were great I had the coastal sour along with another guest in our party and the others had something off the barrel aged list which was delicious as well. For starters we had the watermelon/beets, the bacon fat popcorn, and the tuna- all which were very innovative, interesting, and fun. For main courses we had the short ribs, scallops, and the hanger steak and nothing but rave reviews all around. Honestly- we couldn't have had a better time and our server (I can't remember his name unfortunately) was so helpful and friendly and described the dishes better than any menu could!",

It did not let us down! Chopped salad was definitely one of the best salads I've ever had. What a unique combination of ingredients that totally worked. Short ribs were divine. My boyfriend got the piggy and waffle app which was his favorite part of the meal (although he also really enjoyed the meatloaf). I don't eat pork but I tasted the waffle and it was excellent. We shared the peanut butter banana pudding dessert and it was really really good- better than I even expected based on the description. My cocktail, the Protege, was excellent too. So interesting and complex. Our server was very helpful and friendly. If you are in Scottsdale, definitely don't miss this place.",

    "text": "After all the reviews - some from folks that I respect greatly - I'm hoping this was just an anomaly... so here goes...  Food:  Chopped salad ... fantastic - but my dining companion and I ordered it to share, and when brought to the table, the server mixed it and divided it between the four diners - each just having a spoon full or two to taste.  Not wanting to embarrass anyone - we went with it ... but they should make note of that in the order and serve accordingly.  My short ribs were under-done - meat was cooked - but - short ribs require long and slow cooking to melt away the fat and leave the yummy goodness.  My meat was so loaded with fat that I spent most of my meal trying to find lumps of meat that were edible and separate from the heavy fat layer.  Fail.  The seasonal veggie appeared to  be swiss chard or something similar - tough - long strings - not a lot of flavor - not tender.  The parsnip puree was good.  Another diner had the meat loaf that the server praised.  Large portion - but very dense and not a lot of flavor - saved by the sauce from my short ribs.  Another companion had the filet and greatly enjoyed his.  Drinks:  Moscow mule - so so - not overwhelmed with that.  The Citizen cocktail was enjoyed.  The Tilia malbec, Mendoza, Argentina wine - \"one note\".  Not good, not enjoyable.  Those who had the Sazerac really enjoyed that - though it was a very small serving in a small glass.    Service:  Our server was great - but almost too \"animated\" for my liking ... but over all (other than the salad situation) - service was good - though it took a LONG time between courses and also to have plates cleared.  Atmosphere:  Nicely decorated and in a fun area of town.  BIGGEST complaint though is the noise level.  We couldn't hear the conversation of the folks sitting on the other side of the table - this after moving once to find a more quiet table.  There's nothing in the space to help deaden the sound - hard surfaces floor to ceiling - and perhaps - the architecture of the ceiling is the culprit.  Patio would have been nice - but it was taken by a private party.  Men's room needed a splash of clorox by the urinal ... Lastly - it was a bit on the warm side.  Not sure I'll go back ... hate to risk a good evening at these prices.  Wish I could have had the meal so many others seem to have enjoyed.",

It was ok, and for a few bucks more, i would have preferred my regular gin and tonic. Too much flavor and spice in the barrel drinks for me palette.  We had the bacon popcorn and fondue as bar appetiserrs, both excellent.    For entrees we had the meatloaf, the scallops, the black cherry roasted short ribs and I had the grilled cheese.  There were also all wonderful.  Well prepared and presented.  Our waiter was suberp and it made for a ncie evening.  Noise level was not so bad until the place started hopping around 8 PM.  Then the noise level was a bit much for us old fuddy duddities.",

The chopped salad, as I was eating it, the whole time I was comparing it to the SAME EXACT salad which is served at Cowboy Ciao practically across the street. I have to admit, Cowboy Ciao wins. The tomato in citizen's salad was not fresh, and the salad had a strange texture because I really think they just skimped on the freshness of the ingredients. Aside from that though, why are you serving the same exact thing as a neighboring restaurant and trying to call it your signature dish???!!! One of you has to figure it out and take it off the menu, that's the most ridiculous thing ever. Citizen's tasted fine, but Cowboy Ciao would win on this one.  We ordered the pork belly pastrami also at yelp's recommendation and were not fans. it tasted like old coffee, it was really strange texture again and just not that great.   The positives- Scallops were a delicious dish and the pudding jar is amaaaaazing dessert. I wanted to lick the jar of that pudding dish, it was so yummy.   Basically my experience was just so so, would I recommend it if someone were to ask me where they should eat in old town? No, would I go out of my way to go there again? No, but was it a decent experience? Sure",

There was a fair amount of space in between tables but it was still very cozy.  Our waiter was excellent and helped to recommend some dishes for us to try.  We started with the chopped salad.  If you haven't tried this, you need to.  It was fantastic.  They bring it out to the table with all of the ingredients lined up separately and then they mix it in front of you.  It was one of the best salads I have ever had.  From there, I had the seared scallops and she had the smoked duck.  Both were outstanding.  The scallops were served medium rare I believe and were very tasty.  The duck was tender and juicy and had a great flavor.  We also tried some dessert.  We shared the brownie and the one with the pudding and graham crackers.  Both were very good though the brownie was very rich. (I am not sure if they still have these on the menu).  I had the Manhattan listed on their cocktail list and it was by far one of the best I have ever had.  So much so that I had 2 of them.  My girlfriend had their cocktail that comes with a sugar/candy rim and rock candy (the Citizen).  They have a great selection of cocktails and beers here.  The waiter, again, was on point.  I want to say his name was James? Either way, the service was excellent and we will definitely be back.  Expect to easily spend around $100 for two people depending on how hungry you are but I can guarantee it is worth it.  If you have not been here yet, make sure that you find time to do so.",

While I'm regretting not getting the short ribs, I was still reasonably happy with the venison that I received. However, I was left a little disappointed, because it was missing something. Additional searing, some salt and peppering, etc. It just wasn't up to snuff. It was tender as can be, however if I'm paying $38 for two medallions of meat, I expect to be blown away. I was less than blown away, since it just tasted like... well... meat. No complexity of flavor or aroma. It could appeal to people, but not me.

On the multiple times I've been to public house and on only about 1/2 of them has the service and wait time been good. The other 1/2 of the time the service has been extremely slow. This is especially annoying when you are getting take out or looking for a quick meal. Last time I went to public house I sat for 1.5 hours waiting for only a chopped salad. My friend who was with me waited just as long for her watermelon salad. In spite of the wait times and the service, Public House has wonderful food and is def. worth a try!

Citizen had always been in the back of mind and I decided to make my way to Old Town and give it a try.  Do not walk, run to Citizen.    I was greeted warmly by staff and a lovely atmosphere.  Dark wood beams surrounded by warm butter colored walls and soft candle light.  White table cloths and black and white pictures adorn the walls of this beautiful structure.  I started with the pastrami pork belly with hints of horseradish that play perfectly with mustard and brussel sprouts.  A dish that could be too rich if executed carelessly.  Absolutely perfect.  Followed by the scallops.  Perfectly cooked to medium rare.  Very sweet with the right amount of pan sear.    The staff is attentive and not overwhelming.  I felt at home.  I'm still dreaming of the pastrami pork belly.  Well done, my friends.  Well done.",

    "text": "Let me just say that stars or words cannot express the fabulous dining experience I had with friends last Sunday! I am originally from NYC, now living in Atlanta, and was visiting friends in Phoenix last weekend. We were going to the theatre in Tempe and my friend who lives there suggested a number of restaurants that she has been too. We checked menus online, discussed, and she decided to make reservations at Citizen. As it turned out the show we saw ran longer than we expected and we were going be late for dinner. My friend called and they said no problem at all. I guess being a Sunday night was not as booked as let's say a Friday or Saturday. We actually got to the restaurant almost an hour late and they could not be more gracious seating us right away and our waiter came over immediately. His name is Kent and if there is a school for training wait staff and servers, Kent should be an instructor! He was engaging, personable, knowledgeable about menu items, drinks, wines, and never once rushed us and really made us feel like we had all the time in the world.   My 2 friends and I shared appetizers with the original chopped salad and mac n' cheese. This salad was perhaps the best I've ever had anywhere! The flavor combinations were amazing and the mac n' cheese pretty darn good too. For entrees, one friend had the pan-seared scallops, another friend had the short ribs, and I had the meatloaf. We tasted from each other and everything was perfectly prepared. My meatloaf? Being a bit of a meatloaf type guy I can safely say was the best I've had ever! For dessert, we had coffees and shared something called The Dude Jar, or basically just a jar of delicious chocolate heaven!  I think this is fairly new spot and I really hope they succeed. I'm not sure what the dining scene is like in Phoenix now but I will be back next time in town!",

    "text": "I enjoyed my experience at C.P.H. and will go back. I want to point out the positives and negative of my experience. After a long day of catering, I started with their version of a Manhattan. To no surprise, it was great. Their cocktails are always great! I love the alterations they make to the list from time to time and it also shows how good their bartenders/mixologists are. Before my meal arrived, Eric(a mixologist) was just finishing his shift. He, like me, had a long day. He treated him self to a beer and a pour of Amaro and we struck up a great conversation. A truly genuine person. He is incredibly knowledgeable about spirits and He will be the reason I go back. I want him making my cocktails in the future.  As for the meal. I chose the game hen. The presentation was great. The flavor was good. The sauces they put on the plate could be kicked up a notch, especially the one made with the peppers from Calabria. I would say commit a tad bit more. The most  displeasing thing was the amount of vegetables they gave you. In total, 1/8 of a full size Portobello mushroom, maybe 12 English peas and one tiny marinated in a can artichoke heart. To pay in the high 20's for a plate I want to be full and also feel like I got a fair amount of food. Is that not fair?  C.P.H. would of received 3 stars, if it wasn't for Eric saving the night.",

There's so much going on in the plate BUT in a GOOD way.    I got the kale salad and tried the bread pudding dessert - all are delicious!!!!  Kale salad is so good - it has smoked mozzarella on the bottom. It's so good, it almost taste like meat. So the waitress told me that was the secret to the Kale Cesar. I love the cheese on top of it, it's not too strong either. It's such a delicious salad. I love the crunch of kale and freshness of it. I am a kale girl - I love kale and everything and anything kale, especially if they can take i step a notch.   The bread pudding was delicious. It has strawberry in it and the crispiness from the chips is great! It's also soft - a mixture of textures - wow-o!  The waitress and wait staff is extremely nice and helpful.   Great gastropub experience! :]",

Sam, my friendly waiter, checked up on me every time he passed me by and kept me company like a friend. He also surprised me with the menu of the Original Chopped Salad, which was just a perfect combo of all the healthy grains and vegetables you would normally not eat by themselves. I can't wait to try the recipe myself and see if I can live up to Citizen Public House's expectations!   There's an intimate bar in the middle of the restaurant where all the couples sit. But I'd also recommend this place for those of you who want to bring your close family members and for all of you who are looking for some alone time; the wonderful hosts at CPH won't leave you alone.",

    "text": "Delightful. We went on a Thursday at happy hour. It was a special occasion, I was retiring from a 23 year career.  I opened Yelp to find a place near the ceremony.  CPH looked good to me.  I am vegetarian, they did not have any vegetarian entrees on the menu I found online, but I don't let that put me off.  As soon as walk in, you feel relaxed, and special.  The environment is elegant and not stuffy.  Our server, Paul, was genuine, professional, kind, sincere, and conscientious.  Happy hour drink prices are insanely reasonable.  It is evident immediately that we should relax and enjoy each others company and take in the experience.  I never felt forgotten, I felt nudged to savor my friends, my food, my drink.  We started with the hummus, the little cucumber salad was AMAZING! I told Paul I was a vegetarian and asked if there was anything we could do besides the salads.  He told me of a vegetarian entree that was available yesterday and he asked the chef if it was still available. It was, it sounded delicious, so I tried it.  It was AMAZING, risotto, carrots, cauliflower, asparagus, parsnips.  The risotto was a teeny tiny bit overcooked but the flavor was awesome and the veggies were PERFECT!  And the portion was GENEROUS; Seriously, I took half of it home. It was $20.  My gf had the tacos, she loved them and the FRIES, she loved the fries.  My husband had the braised short ribs, he reports that they were very very good.  We all three shared the beet salad, it was so good I wanted to lick the plate.  The beets were cooked perfectly, the fancy lettuce was perfectly crunchy, the dressing was light and addicting.  Because it was a special occasion we ordered the black and tan dessert.  It was the best dessert I've ever had, I don't know what's in it other than chocolate and heaven, just try it!  But, share it, it's rich enough to satisfy four people.  We will definitely return.",

The atmosphere is very chill, has indoor and outdoor seating.  Service was great, the waiter explained everything on the menu with such detail and passion that I couldn't  wait to try everything.  The chop salad is a must, perfect texture and flavor, the corn and salmon harmonize together wonderfully.  Also, for starters, we got the Tuna...one word....AMAZING.  Large chunks of tuna, seared and seasoned perfectly.  The three of us had the short rib, filet mignon and the osso bucco.  I couldn't tell which one I liked more.  The meats were prepped and cooked like nothing I have seen before.  The flavor, texture and juiciness were to die for.  I honestly could not find one single thing wrong with anything they had there, and I am an anal type of guy.    I even enjoyed two Thai Margaritas, that were the perfect balance of flavor and alcohol.  If you are in Arizona, you have to go to this place at least once.  I wish they had one in DC, I would honestly eat there twice a week!",

    "text": "After trying The Gladly and falling in love, I figured I had to try the older sister, aka Citizen Public House.  I am not huge on Old Town Scottsdale. Don't get me wrong - it can be fun, and there's some good eats, but I'm more of a Central Phoenix gal. That being said, this location is very nice. It's not right on Scottsdale Road, but rather on a side street, so parking isn't as crazy, which is a definite plus.  Restaurant is big, spacious, tastefully decorated, and the service is good. We were lucky enough to get in on the tail end of happy hour. I had the pacific coast cocktail, which tasted pretty good, and it was strong, which made it definitely good. It had an interesting flavor and it wasn't too sweet. My husband had boulvardier, which was also nice and good if you like bourbon.  Food wise, I had my favorite chopped salad because I'm hooked and I just can't get enough. It was lovely, as always. My husband had the buttermilk roasted chicken, which was awesome. The chicken was super moist. I love brussel sprouts so I gladly ate them off the plate - they were seasoned well and cooked al dente. Accompanying succotash was also very good. I wish we had tried dessert but we were too full.  It was very nice, and if you live nearby or haven't tried it yet, I think it's worth a trip. Since The Gladly is a lot closer for me, I think it'll be my go to place, but I was not at all disappointed with Citizen Public House. Given the choice of any restaurant is Old Town Scottsdale, I honestly think this would be my number 1.",

The grilled cheese was an only carbfest.  The Chopped Salad menu item is a bit bizarre. The menu directs you to the Facebook page of said chopped salad instead of offering any hints to ingredients. Odd marketing choice.  So, it's a good time with fairly good food. The cocktails are tasty and the service was all in all very friendly.",

My dad had a Manhattan and he said it was the best he's ever had. And he's drunk a lot of Manhattans over his life.   When I came here the first time, the server messed up on my friend's order. When notified right away about the mistake, the server said that our table could keep the mistake dish and the actual order will be out right away. It showed up five minutes later and the server was apologetic. Nothing over the top but apologetic. He ended up not charging our table for either of the dishes. Completely unexpected and appreciated. He got a good tip.   I deducted one star because the the noise level inside is very high. The restaurant has concrete floors and drywall. The only thing soaking up the sound is people's clothes. It's hard to have intimate conversations since it's so loud inside.",

Oh man.. it totally reminds me of a tea salad when the waitress explains all the parts and mix them together. The salad was just absolutely delicious and was a great starter. I then got the short ribs (rubbed with coffee), so I definitely couldn't resist that. The short ribs was so tender, I didn't need to use the knife they gave me. I wasn't a huge fan of the parsnip puree, but it was very smooth. My coworker's pork osso buco was also super tender and juicy. This place has a great vibe and great for hanging out with friends.",

All of the promotions and photos indicate this would be a cozy restaurant with ample decor to support their \"sense of old community and public house vibe\", but this \"public tavern\" image certainly isn't what you get. There are white walls with a few collections of framed pictures. It reminded me of a Bar Rescue makeover, but Jon Taffer would certainly be impressed with the volume of business... it's like there isn't enough game in town.  The \"happy hour\" cocktails were essentially half-size, which negates the point of \"happy hour\" pricing. Even more disappointing, the cocktails weren't mixed.

It's so good that every time we know we are heading to Scottsdale for a work trip, our team immediately makes reservations here and can't stop thinking about the chopped salad.

I can't eat salmon so they make a chicken one for me.  The cocktails here are always delicious and they make a great sazerac which is my favorite.  For entrees I have had the short ribs and the pork shank and both are amazing but I might say short ribs are my favorite but just slightly.  The service here is always outstanding.

    "text": "Wow!! I made a reservation here after checking out Yelp reviews.  A group of 8 of us were in town for a vacay, and good food was on the top of our list! It happened to be restaurant week, which turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The menu/deal was a no-brainer, especially for those of us who wanted the scallops, as the 2 extra courses were only an additional $3.  I had the beet salad which was really good, but I am having serious regret over not ordering the OMFG chop salad which was amazing. Hubs did get it & I wanted to inhale it! Luckily they sent us home with the recipe & I can't wait to try to make it! I had the scallops which were outstanding, and for dessert the French toast bread pudding, which I did inhale.  We really enjoyed this meal & I think it was the best one of our trip! I recommend going & getting the salad for sure! (And I never rave about a salad...!)",

However, the rest of the salad was splendid.    - My main, the pork shank was ridiculously huge.

This is undoubtedly one of the best salads I have ever had, and they mix all of the fresh ingredients right in front of your eyes! Each of us ordered something different for our main courses, and nobody was disappointed. I especially recommend the french fries. For dessert, the French toast bread pudding was to die for! The strawberry rhubarb sauce and buttermilk ice cream put it over-the-top.   The atmosphere is pretty swanky yet warm and inviting. Dress code is what you make of it; one could easily fit in with cocktail or dressier attire, however we wore jeans and T-shirts. A great place to have an intimate date or a family celebration. The background music was low, however due to the crowd of excited diners, it did get a little noisy. Who needs to talk when the food is this good though, right?!",

We had dinner at your restaurant on Saturday July 9 and it was hands down one of the best experiences I've had in any restaurant. I eat all over the world and am so excited to come back and eat here again. First, Gary, our waiter, is a keeper and an exceptional waiter. A professional in every sense and he made the meal even better than if we'd just had your incredible food.   The food, well, everything was delicious and I've been dreaming of another chop salad since the moment I left. I tried to talk my party into going back the next night!! The mac and cheese named after you was creamy and perfect. I loved the hush puppies and my meatloaf. Topping the meal off with the carmel chocolate treat was a wonderful choice. Keep up the good work and we will see you as soon as I book my next trip to PHX. Thanks for setting a great standard for other restauranteurs!   Love always,  Maile",

Apparently the original chopped salad has its own Facebook page, which is fun and kind of annoying because I hate having to go to Facebook for everything nowadays.  Fortunately the waiter explained what was in it, which included things like smoked salmon, sunflower seeds and raisins.  I'm normally not a fan of smoked salmon or raisins (no, I don't hate everything, I swear) but it worked out well in this salad.  Shared the filet mignon with my wife as an entree.  Absolutely delicious.  We got the Moe'scow Mule and a Sazerac as drinks.  Both were made well.",

I don't know what took me so long to get here.  This is a destination for foodies, and not just because it's been featured on the Cooking Channel or the Food Network.  Some Highlights:  --Tender Belly Bacon Fat Popcorn! (Not for the pretentious and idiotic) --Gorgonzola-Emmental mac-n-cheese (Not for the lactose) --The Chopped Salad (This ish is famous yo) --The Squealer Burger (yeah, it has bacon in it)  This place is absolutely amazing.  If you appreciate food, and can afford to splurge both in the wallet and palate, then make this a destination.   Absolutely worth it. Next time, I want to try the Lamb Burger.  Also, the cocktail and draught list is solid. Goose Island Matilda FTW! (Yes, I know its a Budweiser product)",

    "text": "This place was absolutely fantastic! Great ambiance and fantastic food. We got the Pork Belly Pastrami, which was like an inside out Ruben, wonderful. Chopped Salad, very good, especially with the smoked salmon. Gypsy Bacon Sandwich, the bacon was unbelievable, along with the sandwich innards made it refreshing. Lastly we got the Duck. This was probably the best. It had a great \"millet\" (like grits), and it went so well with the perfectly cooked duck.  The only thing I would suggest, it to NOT get the Pork Belly and Bacon Sandwich together. There was just a bit too much bacon/pork flavor, it detracted a bit from the meal. It would have been helpful if the server had mentioned that.  Overall, I would highly recommend Citizen Public House. It is a bit pricy, but just getting the sandwiches would definitely help keep the price down.",

My girlfriend ordered the grilled cheese and it was one of the worst I've ever tasted. The bread resembled store bought and there was some sort of mashed potato in it. The chocolate cake dessert was good, a little stale, but still good. The drinks were the lone bright spot, disregarding the price. The moscow mule and old fashioned I ordered were pretty spot on.   All in all this place is not worth the price mainly due to the uninspired and expensive food. I would, however, go grab a drink there. If you are looking for a nice restaurant with a cool ambiance keep looking because you won't find it here",

We also tried the house chopped salad, which isn't your typical salad at all, and tasted wonderful. There was arugula, couscous, smoked salmon and other yummy things that I can't remember in it. LOVED!  We tried the short ribs, which were crusted with coffee and served with a dipping sauce. I loved the short ribs and also the dipping sauce. It was plated with greens and a parsnip puree. I'm not that into parsnips so that wasn't my favorite part of dinner, but my mom really liked them. The greens to me were ok, but just that :).  For dessert we had a pumpkin chocolate pie with cocoa whipped cream and some kind of a brittle on the side. This was truly delicious!   Service was excellent. Highly recommend coming here and also making a rezzy as they are busy.",

Their cauliflower dish was also good but it was the only veg entree. :/ My hubs liked his pork belly option but I'm reviewing so, I still give -1 since I didn't have a lot to chose from.

We started with the bread plate - two different types of bread come toasted with a bacon jam and seasoned butter.  Move over standard bread plates CPH stepped up their game with this one.  We also got one of their \"bar snack\" items.  The olive plate was exactly what we needed to nibble on before our dinner.    Our mains were the short ribs and scallops.  The one thing we noticed was this specific location does an exceptional job to make sure you get a full balanced meal.  Meaning, they have your protein (made to perfection), your carb in a normal portion and last your veggies.  Most places give you a small portion of veggies and we always get frustrated by this.  CPH made sure to load on the greens seasoned perfectly.  This alone helped the location stand out.  It is refreshing to have a balanced plate!  The server was awesome and I would love to set him up with one of my friends but was too shy to ask. LOL.  The atmosphere is cute but it's the food that sets this location apart.  If you want a divine meal cooked to perfection make sure to stop in.",

I opted to sit outside on the small patio and probably wouldn't again because the patio chairs are hard metal and pretty uncomfortable after a while.   I managed to get there in time for happy hour and ordered the red that was on the happy hour menu, which was not great, but it was still wine. For my main, I ordered the short ribs, which were definitely the star of the show and I would recommend ordering if you enjoy short ribs. The flavor was on point (coffee rubbed) and came with a fabulous sauce that comes on the side (which is great for those of us who do not like to have sauce all over the sides as well). One of the short ribs was a bit dry but dipped in the sauce I could barely the notice.   Lastly, I ordered the jammy bread pudding, which the waitress did warn me was not actually bread pudding but more like french toast but I went ahead anyway and regretted it. It is actually a piece of french toast with a thin layer of jam and a scoop of ice cream on top. The \"toast\" was a little burnt around the edges and overall it just wasn't great. The ice cream flavors they had sounded interesting and in hindsight I wish I had gone with that instead.  The service was great, from having my water constantly refilled to my waitress (I believe her name was Carmen) who was available but not oppressive.  Overall, I would dine here again but sit inside on more comfortable chairs and try the ice cream instead of the bread pudding. I would also be interested to try some of the items on the happy hour menu since I saw other people get them and they looked delicious.",

We ordered bacon popcorns and flat bread for starters.  They were ok.  Nothing exciting.  I ordered short ribs for entree.  The meat was too lean for my taste.  Not bad but average.  Obviously I saved room for dessert.  Bread pudding and lemon pie.  Well, that's the highlight of the evening.  I enjoyed the desserts very much.  The restaurant setting was nice but the noise level is extremely high.  Make sure to raise an octave higher during conversation.",

    "text": "Celebrated my birthday here last night.  The atmosphere is was just perfect for my casual celebration! It was fun, relaxing, and just the right mood! I love the center bar, which is mastering each handcrafted concoction, into an elevated cocktail. We all really, really enjoyed each cocktail! The wine list is great as well, after we sipped until the last drop, we chose a nice Walla Walla red to go with our meal. Now, I know this place has a great rating and over 1,800 reviews, but I want to convey, it's a great experience with really good food! In my opinion it's not exceptional fine dining, that's mind blowing, however it's a solid restaurant who balances the flavors and textures perfectly. Some of our appetizers let me down a little, the pork belly was weighed down in a heavy cream sauce, that overtook the pork! The char on the bread in the burrata was too much for me, however the cheese was silky and the accompaniment arugula, and sauce was lovely! The last appetizer was the famous \"chopped salad\" a must almost every review suggested. It was good, I think A little hyped in my opinion, I was glad we ordered it as an appetizer, because the flavor would of been hard to get through as a main dish. (Smokey salmon easily comes through) yummy a few bites in, them you're done:) Our main dishes were delicious!  Short Ribs, Meatloaf, Chicken, The Burger and Scallops. All were cooked perfectly! The broccoli on my daughters dish was the only side that was off. It tasted too smoked, it literally was like chomping on a fire-log.  Again, I rated this restaurant for what it is, it's not a fine dining 5star restaurant. It is a restaurant in a great location, a great atmosphere, a super bar! And they make really good food!  Bon Appetite",

Cooked perfectly and the corn grits were a nice compliment.   The tacos were ok. Three mini tacos served with corn.  I was not a fan of the tuna crudo.

Not too busy for a Friday night around 530pm; however, it did get more crowded after 6pm.  Happy Hour ends at 6pm too.  I was able to try the chopped salad, fondue, and wings for appetizers.  My entree was a Duck Breast which was very juicy.  It also came with apple garnish along with risotto as the starch.  It was a pretty tasty dish.  Overall, great place to grab a bite when visiting Scottsdale, AZ",

We sat at the bar, served by an awesome mixologist/bartender named Brandon, who is a fellow foodie as well. Was blown away by their signature dish: Pastrami topped Pork Belly and told Brandon to tell the Chef/Co-Owner that his Pork Belly was better than the famed Momofuku of NYC. He immediately went to the kitchen to pass the message, and it was much appreciated by Chef Bernie. Drinks made by Brandon were outstanding as well, my fav was their signature drink The Im-Port (Jameson, Port, tobacco and leather bitters, rock sugar rim etc). We also had the Smoked Duck, Short Rib and Lamb Burger - all great dishes. Highly recommended and will be pushing for a No Reservations or Layover episode here soon. GO!",

Neither one of us realized that we were about to have an amazing dinner! Wow! I think it is probably one of those restaurants where every item on the menu is excellent, but the Truffle Grilled Cheese was so good that I don't know if I could bring myself to order anything else. My boyfriend is still talking about how amazing his lamb burger was. We can't wait to go back! Also, the noise level wasn't too bad when we were there, but it might get a little loud when it's really packed. Excellent service too!",

Being the foodies that we are my wife and I picked our hotel in Scottsdale not based on how close it was to the event we were attending but based on the surrounding restaurants. This gastropub did not let us down, we started off with the pork belly it was so tender and perfectly seasoned that I almost contemplated ordering another one for my entree. But the rest of the menu looked so appetizing and our waiter was so enthused about the rest of the food that I went with the duck and my wife went with the restaurant week prix fix menu.",

From the moment we were greeted by the pleasant hostess our experience was nothing but professional and welcomming. The place was moderately busy on a Thursday night, service staff bustling around, but not \"panic mode.\" Our server (Gary?)was very knowledgable of all the menu items and the wine list. We were told by him as well as friends that we had to get the pork belly pastami app, it was the best thing we had! The crab cakes were good, not the best I ever had, but I would get them again. The short rib entree was outstanding. Perfect balance of savory, salty, sweet, sour etc. Gary even split the dish for us even though we didn't ask for that, he over heard us saying we were going to share, very nice touch. We passed on dessert, since i had a special one waiting at home for me. Gary still brought me a tiny box of truffles to enjoy later and knowledged my birthday, with out a big fanfare (which is what i prefer) We didn't have any cocktails, since I was having a champagne kinda night, but I know Richie Moe makes some of the best cocktails in town. We will be definately be back soon and I have already told many people of our experience. Thanks to gary and the rest of the staff for a memorable b-day dinner :)",

He answered our questions, made recommendations and took our drink orders. We started with a bottle of sparkling wine - Cannot remember name but they had a nice selection.    Waiter was polite and made recommendations.   He also suggested 6-7 dishes and everything was great and came out at the right time. Don't skip the desserts.",

In fact, we were so taken by the drinks that the bartenders convinced me to let them pair cocktails with my meal, forgoing my usual wine pairing approach. I wasn't disappointed. I started with the pork belly pastrami which they paired with a bourbon cocktail. It was a fantastic pairing. For my entree I went with the lamb loin which was fantastic. They paired it with a mint julep. Smart, classic choice. Not only were the bartenders great, our server was as well. We enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, the service and the cocktails. What more could you ask for? Highly recommended.",

Velveeta on $35 chicken doesn't make it gourmet chicken. On top of that the service was less than ideal and slow.   I will say that the restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere and maybe we just came on a bad night?",

Excellent drink and the smoky / citrus overtones of the drink were a great marriage.  Ordered the Pork Osso Buco for dinner. This was the only let down of the night. While the pork had a nice flavor, the meat was cold near the bone (so I could tell it had been  pre-cooked) and the mashed potatoes were pretty flavorless.   Followed up dinner with a Guinness beer. Got to give it to the bartenders, they looked like they were having a blast. Kind of guys I would love to hire for my business.  While my overall rating was a 3 (based primarily on the food) if I am back in town I will be glad to give the place a second chance.",

We were immediately disappointed as we were looking forward to fish and chips. However, we drove pretty far to get there so decided to stay. It was pretty trendy and fancy with high prices and an odd menu. Our server Sean was Extremely helpful in guiding us and explained the name means 'a house the public of all types can come to'. Ok, but as we looked over the menu, it was odd foods. He explained that their chopped salad is a favorite and worth every bite.  My husband is not a salad guy but ordered it based on the server's advice. I ordered the ramen soup and we hoped. Both of these things were on the menu as appetizers. Food was odd and the salad looked small. However, take one bite and wow! Wow! Such bold flavors in the soup with a par-boiled egg, bacon, kimchee, and chopped thai chilies in a dark broth. Loved every spoonful and couldn't finish it. So spicy! The chopped salad was incredible! Smoked salmon, freeze-dried corn, currants, pumpkin seeds...all melded together so that every bite was amazing. It filled up my husband and that is not easy! LOL! We will go back but will be better dressed.  As an aside, one of the female servers near our table smelled sooo bad! She was blond, thin and looked like a hippie mess. She smelled like pachouli, BO and dirt and every time she came by our area, I had to hold my breath. YUCK!",

    "text": "My friend and I recently came to Citizen Public House for dinner (Tuesday evening). The restaurant was crowded (past 6pm), but the host was kind enough to offer us a table, as long as we could leave before 8pm as they had reservations. I appreciated that they accommodated us despite their busy schedule.   The restaurant has a great ambiance and a bar in the center of the place. It was slightly loud but not an annoying level of noise. We went for two beers from the draft beer menu (a house brew and a locaL IPA). We shared a salad as a starter.   Our main courses were really outstanding. My friend had the seared scallops, and I had the amaro meatloaf. I didn't try the scallops myself, but the meatloaf was exquisite. The look if the dish is extremely appealing, to the extent that my friend HAD to try it (picture in the review). It's a delicious veal demi-glace meatloaf that comes with roaster zucchini and smashed gold potatoes, and a tasty and rich mushroom cream. It was surprising that this was the cheapest priced item in the menu, at 20 dollars!  It was my third time in Citizen Public House, and it was consistently outstanding. I've been to this place in both, high season (winter/spring), and low season (summer), and it's always busy, so I really recommend making a reservation.",

I, of course, loved it.  Since the other person with me doesn't like smoked salmon he would have preferred a different meat or fish.  They give you a recipe, so I will try it at home and use chicken.  In any case, he still liked it a lot which says something, when you don't  even like a main ingredient.  He was blown away by the pork belly pastrami.  So flavorful!    We came here from Cabo and had a layover until our flight tomorrow to San Francisco and thought it would be a good to roam around old town Scottsdale and try some of the ten things you must eat in Phoenix!",

There were 4 pieces of radish on top of the fish and it sat on top of golden beets. The flavor was good and it wasn't too \"fishy.\" The server was nice and attentive.

    "text": "Citizen Public House is an upscale, modern American restaurant where you can find plenty of unique dishes and a signature salad with its own Facebook site.  My Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)  Atmosphere - We checked out Citizen Public House on a week night, but it was still busy.  Lights will be dim, noise will be loud, but everything around you is modern.  If you're looking for a quiet place, Citizen Public House is not it.  But if you're ok with the high energy and noise you'll love it.  Service - Our server was better than great.  He was very accommodating.   We made reservations over the phone for a large party, and he secured a semi-private room for us and let us put in several appetizer orders ahead of time.  Throughout the meal the entire team went above & beyond, making sure we were ok, talking about our love of food, and making sure our experience would be perfect.  1 Star.  Food - The appetizers rule at Citizen Public House.  I think it's ridiculous that a SALAD has its own Facebook page.  Then I ate it.  It was ridiculously good.  The presentation itself is great, and once the servers mix it together, it becomes a fresh, modern, texture packed bite.  I will admit I doubted it but now I'm a believer. Bacon fat popcorn.  Yes.  It was even great the next day.  Pork Belly Pastrami - tender, well-seasoned, and could have been my main meal.  Which is funny because looking back, I enjoyed all the appetizers a lot more than the main courses.  The scallops were good and my short rib was not as tender as I would have liked, but after our appetizer fest it really didn't matter.  Bottom line is the pre-meal is where I'll put my money in the future.  1  1/2 Star.  Will I Return? - For the apps!  Not sure the main courses are worth it for a return visit, but I would come back and order the same delicious starters as I did that night.  Now, Citizen Public House is not cheap, so that's all I would be able to afford.   1/2 Star.  My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts): 1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm. 1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point. 2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food. 1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return.   Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.",

I was staring at a hotel near this place and the reviews couldn't be better, but what really made me decide was the pictures showing a very unique kitchen. As I arrived the place was packed but traveling by myself has its advantages I was able to find a place at the bar. This guys are friendly and even though the bar was full, the service was excellent. Started with a glass of wine and the crab cakes. They arrive within 5 minutes oil ordered them. Taste was fresh and not fishy at all, loved how well they go with the salad and sauce they came on top of. They tastes very good but I am sure there has to be another appetizer in the menu that would actually blow my mind. Not a bad start at all  To follow the trout: presentation was a 10, cooked to perfection with skin as it should. The flavor as good and perfect it was, also it was also missing something, I was set up to be impressed but I was stopped just just short of it.   As good as the appetizer and the entree were I would not repeat these dishes as it is my believe there has to be a mind blowing dish... Maybe the scallops ?   To finish the bread pudding... It actually has bacon on it!! STOP THE PRESS!!! I've found it!! One out of three. This is just fantastic and mind blowing. apple and bacon bread pudding with brown butter ice cream is TO DIE FOR!  This gives solid grounds to my theory that there has to be other mind blowing items in the menu I have not tried.  This is a very solid 4 star restaurant, I just need my mind blown 3 out 3 but being so close to do so I will definitely give this restaurant a try",

Appetizers were good, not great, but redeemed by the lamb burgers, which were the best we've ever had - juicy, perfectly cooked, lots of flavor. Service was friendly but spotty (we asked for bread, none came; we had a loooonnnnggg wait for our entrees despite being one of only 4 tables). I think this is probably a 5-star place when humming on all cylinders.",

With the appetizer these were more than we could finish.  The drinks are expensive and my wife was underwhelmed with her designer cocktail.  I stuck to Guiness.  Overall we had a wonderful time and would recommend this place to anyone.",

I would definitely get it again. I then had the grilled cheese sandwich with a tasty cherry spread--very gourmet! I tasted my friend's chopped salad which was incredible. It was not your ordinary chopped salad, as it had couscous, smoked salmon, corn, etc. I would definitely order this salad when I visit again. The atmosphere had a clean, uptown look with nice, low lighting. What was unique about this place was its interesting menu. I loved all the new foods I tried tonight!",

So much so that I had to ask if they were affiliated with one another- sure enough the chef for cph had worked at Cowboy Ciao for 15 years or something the waiter said. Ok. Got it. The thing about both of these restaurants is that the menu is very eclectic, interesting ingredients such as duck fat in the ice cream. Friends ordered the famous chop salad and loved it. Even this has dehydrated corn in it. This restaurant has beautiful decor, not stuffy but elegant. Not something I could see myself wanting to eat all the time. Very rich food. Just ok.",

    "text": "I went here for restaurant week with the Bf last friday night. It was really good. We had a really good server who was friendly and efficient.  For our appetizers, the BF got the bacon fat popcorn and thought it was fantastic.... I'm not a huge fan of bacon, but it was ok in my opinion. I got the Mirliton salad, which was delicious! It has such a variety of textures and flavors, it had popcorn, chayote (which I had never had), cheese, cucumber, onion and really tasty dressing. I would definitely order that again. For mains, the BF got the pork tenderloin, which was absolutely delicious! I was so mad that he ordered better than me (like usual). It was the pork with mashed sweet potato, chevre, and figs with apple jus... it was so delicious and full of flavor. I ordered the chicken which I absolutely would not order again (that's where the star came off). It was chicken with a corn risotto and an onion and mushroom hash. It was all kind of smokey.... but not in a good way, and did not have a flavor that I liked. The risotto was not sweet like I thought it would be... and all the flavors kind of blended together so you couldn't taste the components. I make a better risotto at home, so I was very disappointed. Luckily for me, the BF shared some of his pork with me. So for desserts the BF got the pig in the orchard, which is a bacon bread pudding with a cinnamon -y ice cream. This was good, but my dessert beat the pants off of it (woot!!). I got the pot de creme. This was the highlight of the meal! It was amazing... it was a whiskey, coffee, and chocolate pot de creme and it was so rich and delicious.... if I could eat it everyday, I would, and I would be fat and wouldn't care..... So overall, it was good and I would definitely come back HOWEVER I would definitely not order the chicken again.",

My favorite places to go are ones that have a good bar -have some drinks, appetizers and good conversations with friends.

Our favorite appetizer is the Kilt Lifter fondue and you can't pass up their infamous chicken chopped salad. I've had everything on the menu at least twice and it is always consistent, never had a bad dish or bad time. You can even hop on their WiFi for some work with a cocktail.",

It was pretty late, so not much of a crowd.  The lights were dim, the atmosphere was cozy, and I was happy to see an interesting tap selection.  I had some kind of pale ale by Anchor Steam, and it was yummy.  While I hadn't intended to eat anything, I saw the late night menu and had to try the hummus plate. Best part?  The sweet pickled baby cucumbers. Just like my mom makes!  Bartenders were knowledgable and attentive, crowd was mellow,  it was a romantic way to end our night out, and our last night for this trip to Scottsdale.  Couldn't have been better!",

    "text": "You must go here.  Went during the \"Yelp Eats\" promotion.  Everything we experienced was remarkable. The service, food, drinks, and ambiance were all spectacular.  First, the drinks. There are numerous specialty cocktails, an extensive wine list, draft and bottled beers, aperitif, digestif, single malt scotch, and almost every type of alcohol you could expect. Even unexpected libations that I rarely see elsewhere, such as dessert wines. We had to try their signature cocktails because it seemed to be the right thing to do at CPH. Good booze & good bartenders; can't let those go to waste. We had to have something with gin, so we opted for Aviation & Count Negroni. Both were what we expected. Strong & unique. I don't see anyone disliking Aviation, but Count Negroni is for specific tastes. Try this if you like strong orange and cinnamon flavors. The Campari in this drink makes a statement.  Second, the food. We ordered the \"Smart Chicken\" and the Berkshire Pork Loin. The chicken had a nice crispiness on the outside and had the flavor of lightly fried chicken without all the fat. The risotto, mushrooms, and onions that came with it were amazing.  Now, the pork. The pork! This experience made me fall in love with pork all over again. We all love bacon, but the bland white pork that comes from industrial farms has destroyed its reputation with people who love pork for its flavor, not for its leanness. Granted, I have never had Berkshire pork before this visit, but it was absolutely amazing. They cooked it perfectly. Pink and moist on the inside. The meat was so sweet & tender and the fat was so flavorful. This is due to the quality of Berkshire pork, but also the proper preparation. The stone fruit compote complemented the sweetness of the pork perfectly, as did the pistachios. The gorgonzola/white corn spoon bread was awesome. And the broccoli rabe/chard (couldn't tell exactly what it was) was steamed perfectly with great seasoning and flavor.  Third, the dessert. The bread pudding was fantastic! Like the best apple pie you've ever eaten...only better. The ice cream that came with it was great as well. I ordered a cup of coffee as well, from Roastery of Cave Creek called \"Black and Tan.\" One of the better cups of coffee I've ever had. Even my girlfriend enjoyed it, and it had no cream or sugar. She usually loads up the sugar in coffee but she said that the coffee has so much flavor that it doesn't need anything.  Fourth, the service. Our server, Brian, was very knowledgeable and very courteous. He answered every question we had, gave us the proper attention, and made sure we enjoyed our experience. I can't remember a recent experience with better service than we had here at CPH.  Overall, everything you want in a restaurant. It's in a great location, in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale. I can't compliment this place enough. Just go!",

    "text": "Our son gave us a gift card for my birthday after researching on Yelp!, and the card was waiting for us on arrival.  Located in beautiful Old Scottsdale, this wonderful gastropub is beautiful and trendy, and the food is to die for!  Our server Chris was amazing and recommended the Chainbreaker brew on draft since the Four Peaks Hef was no longer available, and it was delish and we both had two.  We started out with the bacon-fat heirloom popcorn, which my wife didn't care for, but I loved.  Hey, I'm a guy and there was crumbles of warm bacon all through it.  Then we both split their famous chopped salad, which Chris brought to the table unchopped and chopped right before our eyes.  Honestly, I got cold chills with the first bite!  Hands down one of the best tastes ever in a salad, with salmon, tomato, arugula, couscous, etc. (recipe on Facebook,) and delicious homemade Buttermilk ranch dressing--perfection, and we could have eaten a whole one but wanted to save room for more delights to come.  Chris recommended the scallops, which I had already had my eye on, so my wife ordered the buttermilk roasted chicken, served over sweet corn-butter succotash with roasted Brussels sprouts.  Moist and delicious!  My scallops were wrapped in Tender Belly Hampshire bacon, nestled in a bed of roasted corn grits and topped with wilted snow pea greens (yum!) and drizzled with a cola gastrique.  Tenderest and most tasty scallops ever.  By the end of the night manager Owen stopped by to visit--he had been staring at our names for over a month on his bulletin board and he wanted  to put a face with our names.  Chris joined us for the sit down and we had a wonderful conversation. Wanting to try the peanut butter bread pudding, Chris recommended the Guiness pudding jar instead, which was a stout infused chocolate pot de creme over a chocolate shortbread cookie, topped with Irish whiskey crema and two chocolate shortbread cookies on the side, and served in an actual small jar with lid. I threatened to take off Chris' hand when he reached to clear the plate with the remains of the last cookie still on it!  Overall, a perfect night with perfect food and service in a warm inviting atmosphere.  It does NOT get any better than this!  Thank you my son!",

I love bacon, and the ratio of fat to meat was right to hold the burger together, but man, taste it first! I did tell our waiter, and his reply was \"yeah I know, and that's without any seasoning\".

Its enough for 2-4 people to share, and it's one of the best salads (if not THE best) I've ever had. Coming here was the first time I've ever tried scallops, and I this may have been the best place to take that chance--they were undeniably incredible. I will be back to CPH again to try everything on the menu. Seriously. It's that good.  Overall, if you're looking for a delicious meal with great ambiance, go to CPH. There's a reason so many people love it.",

    "text": "If there's a place in old town that you can rely on for quality in food and service, this is the place.  You get what you paid for.  Based on my last few visits, it seems to always be busy, which as you know is a great sign.    This is a place where you come for a date, birthday or just about any type of occasion you can think of.    These are what I consistently get and enjoy:  + Chopped Salad: BOMB.  You cannot come here and not get this.  If you don't have a big appetite, this is a must.  The corn, salmon and dressing does it for me every time.  You just can't go wrong here.  + Lamb Burger: Its very tasty and juicy.  It can be a little messy if you mishandle it.  So I suggest just slicing it in the middle.    + Kale Caesar Salad: BOMB.  Kale is a super vegetable that is packed with nutrients.  They make the Kale anti-bitter with a great balanced Ceasar dressing, served with a cheesy, toasty bread!   Some things can break your wallet but if you manage to try to share your plates in your party, you will walk out okay.  Drinks aren't too pricey.  But if you want to keep the night going, I suggest heading up to their sister bar, Citizen R+D, a speakeasy that is around the building and requires a secret phone call to reserve a table.  There's not much to complain about really.  For its consistency and quality, I will always have them on my go to places.",

    "text": "I've been here twice and always have had a good experience.  Being that there are a bunch of great restaurants in the area, Public House holds it's own, and I'd probably be back again.  This place is great for a quieter nice dinner before a night out for sure.  Sometimes I like to get away from places that are slammed and this place provides that opportunity for that.  It has more of an intimate setting, probably good for dates.  They do have some nice drink selections but being fashioned after a gastropub, I'd say their beer selection is kind of weak.  But then again, I'm going here for the food, so let's say it's more gastro than pub.  The food is all good.  Pork Belly Pastrami was amazing and so were the crab cakes, although portions are small, but I expected this.  I've had the meatloaf, which for meatloaf was damn good especially with the glaze.  I'm not really a meatloaf person, but thought it would be good and it was.  Scallops were also very well done.  A friend of mine ordered the mac n' cheese and didn't like it.  I thought she hates everything and tried it and was disappointed.  One might say, yeah but... mac & cheese?  I have had some, like at Smith & Wollensky's, which is unforgettable.    The staff has always been great.  I know I'll be back here. To really go over the top for me I'm looking for something on the menu that I will crave.",

Like at least two days in advance.  The food was phenomenal and so was the service. Our server, Sam, really took care of us. He was knowledgable, kind, funny and definitely ordered for us only because we asked him to.  We had so many different items, but the one that stuck out the most was that chopped salad with salmon. I can seriously have one every single day and never get tired of it (ok maybe I'm reaching a little, but still, SO GOOD!) I want to come back to Scottsdale just for this place. So, I just might!",

    "text": "Food:  Good. We got the famous chopped salad for an appetizer to share, the pork chop and the scallops.  The 'famous' chopped salad was really quite good and a nice twist on a something of a staple.  Really liked the presentation before it was mixed... not as pretty after they mix it, but tasted great.  The pork chop was a bit dry and overcooked, but the portion was healthy and the sides were quite good.  The scallops were extremely well done, and the mix of flavors in this main was really good.  Serving size was on the smaller side.  Ambiance:  Really very nice. We arrived early for dinner and had the restaurant largely to ourselves until near the end.  Very nice furniture, setting, etc.  Good music (blues) that went well with their overall theme.  People showed up on all types of attire, but I'd suggest business casual type attire to avoid feeling under-dressed.  Service:  Really very good.  They remembered that we had a show to get to and were very conscious of getting us out and to the show on time.  The waitress was attentive, pleasant, and had good suggestions.   They were finishing up preparing for the dinner rush during out meal and the bits and pieces we overheard, the attention to detail was really quite impressive and more than we expected.  Prices:  Considering the neighborhood, etc. not horrible, but not cheap.  $100 for 2 drinks, an appetizer and two mains.  I'd say the $$ rating is off...it should be $$$.  I'd be impressed if you escape for less than ~$35/person and I'd bet that is an uncommon occurrence.  Tip:  You really need to try the chopped salad... it really does deserve the hype.  Net:  Great place for a night out if you're going to hang in Scottsdale for the evening or first date (trying to make a good first impression).  For the price, the portions need to be a bit bigger and consistently excellent to hit 5 stars, but a solid 4 IMO.",

We ordered two appetizers, Bernie's Mac and cheese and chicken gizzard. Bernie's Mac and cheese was very good. You can taste the bread crumbs and tomatoes that were mixed in it and it had the right amount of cheese! The only thing I didn't like about it were the lemon zest that was in it. Chicken gizzards were lightly battered and deep fried and it kind of tasted like popcorn chicken.   For our entrees, we ordered the lamb burger and meatloaf. The meatloaf was simply amazing! It was very juicy, tender and it perfectly tasted well with the mash potato served on the plate. I wasn't a big fan of the lamb burger because the meat was dry and also the sauce that you dip your fries into had an unusual taste to it. It wasn't ketchup, but was some sweet red sauce that left a nasty after taste.   Desserts: We also ordered the coconut lemon dessert. I forgot what it was called but it sure was amazing!! The tapioca coconut pudding with small pieces of mangos in it was phenomenal!!",

The bar area was well organized and clean and the bartenders super friendly. They refilled my drinks promptly and suggested options through my entire meal.  I ended up with the pork belly pastrami which was just insanely good for too many reasons to write up. Simply put, just order it and experience it yourself.   I've always loved chicken & waffles and decided to pull the trigger here at Citizen. The chicken was super moist and the batter was pretty light so it didn't taste or feel overly heavy. The only gripe was the size of the waffle, which was a bit too small for my taste.  Lastly, the bread pudding made from doughnuts!?!!? You've got to be kidding me right?!! That just put me back a few weeks on my workouts by itself! That dish was just another one that you just have to order and experience on your own. So effin good!",

    "text": "This was my first time visiting the Citizen Public House, and have not yet decided if it is somewhere I'd go again.   Upon entering, we were greeted at the hostess stand and taken to our seats. We were seated next to a fairly loud group (not uncommon for Scottsdale on a Saturday night) who seemed to be having a good time discussing the merits of whatever their latest business ventures were and whose volume was not increasing much so chose to keep our appointed table.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was noisy and boisterous, and seemed to be filled with an interesting crowd of people. Half of them were a bit older and begrudgingly eating dinner out that evening and the other half were young  professionals. There was music playing overhead but it barely registered for most of the people there (one woman I overheard in the restroom was audibly surprised to hear it playing for the first time that evening.) The wait staff was incredibly attentive and pleasant-- the waiter introducing himself and shaking our hands was an interesting way to start off the meal.   At our server's recommendation we started off with the Pastrami Pork Belly (for him) and the Original Chopped Salad (for me.) Both were very flavorful and the salad presentation was a fun twist.   For an entree I selected the scallops, and he had the short ribs. My scallops were flavorful and well prepared, although the wilted baby kale which sat atop it was difficult to cut into in order to pair the two for a bite. The scallops were nested in a corn grit mix and the plate was drizzled with an interesting gastrique that was a little too sweet for my taste- I'm more of a vinegar fan.   The short ribs were rubbed a little too generously with coffee with very little extra flavor to add to it; the dipping sauce which was provided to flavor it was a little too salty to enjoy with the meat. Accompanying was a parsnip puree that neither of us were excited about. We agreed the appetizers were the best portion of the meal.   This seems like a great place to take a group of friends for apps and drinks to begin a fun night out in Downtown Scottsdale, but isn't really the type of place I'd recommend to anyone looking for a romantic and quiet dinner.",

My boyfriend had the carne asada tacos which were fatty and very average. Finished with the bread pudding which was alright but the ice cream that came with it was super watery and flavorless. Two stars for service and for the chopped salad. What a bummer this restaurant was",

Atmosphere: this is why I am taking a star off. It was crazy loud. I don't know if it is normally like that but it was so loud that I felt that I was shouting across the table to be heard. It had a fun vibe but honestly way too loud. I felt like I was in a club type atmosphere and not a restaurant.   Food: started off with the Mac and cheese which was actually pretty good. Had a nice flavor to it. Also had the burrata which was very delicious!! I had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and zucchini and it was amazing. Best meatloaf I have ever had and the portion size was huge. My bf ordered the filet, med/rare and he said it was cooked perfectly and delicious!  An overall great experience!",

However, they are willing to customize your meal to your liking.  A couple of things off the top of my head from the menu that I can remember that are vegetarian are the olives (appetizer), the green salad (appetizer, comes with goat cheese), and the Hippie Dippie sandwich (comes with cheese).  My waitress was very helpful to create a vegan entree for me.  They have a vegan entree, but it is not on the menu, so you'll have to ask for it.  It is a marinated and cooked portobello mushroom with purple rice, and cooked kale.  To be honest, I can make better tasting vegan food at home.  It was just okay.  But I was happy that they were accommodating to my desires for a vegan meal.",

We made reservations through Opentable which is a pretty cool and easy website where you can make reservations online and get confirmation. Anyhoo, we get there about 10 mins early and wait for our table, but things are running late. Luckily someone a table opened up fairly quick so it wasn't such a bad start afterall.   We ordered some drinks and I really am partial to the moscow mule. I like how they add cucumbers which gives it a refreshing taste. Also, they call it the Arizona mule here. (interesting). As for food, we got the pork belly pastrami (de-constructed sandwich without the bread), mozzarella (starts with V i forgot the name), scallops, and banana bread pudding. I think the best was the scallop dish which came with kale and was seasoned just right.   I would like to try other things to, so maybe it will change my mind about food.",

    "text": "Let me begin by stating that I'm from Los Angeles, and was not looking forward to the food during my trip to AZ. I usually don't leave reviews after a single visit but given the scenario, I thought why not.  This place is very good. Even in the cut throat restaurant business in LA, this place would make the mark.  The food is all great. I tried the lamb sandwich, meat loaf and short ribs. The short ribs were outstanding, and for 30 bucks, it was also a steal. Very strong beef flavor. Meat loaf was also among the better meat loaf dishes i had ever tried. It's pretty hard to make meatloaf taste \"not boring\" but the dish here was solid. The lamb burger came with battered fries which were very good with the homemade ketchup which was like a marinara. I'm surprised battered fries aren't more popular. The appetizer was my favorite: the pork belly pastrami. Very rich, not for everyone but portioned appropriately.  Service is great, ambience is perfect not too loud, not too quiet. Not too bright, not too dark. Price point is fairly accurate.  What makes this a 5 star rather than a 4 star however are the mixed drinks. They are spectacular. I had a 'Manhattan' which was perfect. So good that it hit me hard without me noticing. The 'career ender' was also good.   It's hard to maintain 800 reviews and still have a 4.5 star overall but I certainly see why this place succeeded in doing so. Next time I'm in old town Scottsdale I'll stop by again for sure.",

Potatoes could've been seasoned a bit more and adding some bacon to the marmalade would've balanced out the sweetness and made this dish amazing!

Perplexed why a commune would be interested in gift cards we decided to give it a go and gathered our finest tie-dye and hippy gear. As we approached we quickly learned this dimly lit classy establishment was a far cry from some sweaty Woodstock memorial. Feeling a bit out of place our wonderful server Josh made us feel right at home and explained the menu. We ordered the chopped salad and pan seared scallops. It's a weird thing to say, but the chopped salad I had here was downright notable. Best salad I've ever had. I never thought I'd be writing about a salad but alas, here I am, ranting and raving about leafy greens. The scallops were right on par as well. Aside from the confusing name this place can't be recommended enough. It will be my go to for entertaining out of town friends and parents next time anyone comes to town. Thank you so much for lovely dinner date and wonder welcome to Phoenix!",

The room is super vibrant - this isn't the place for a quiet dinner - and the energy is awesome. Definitely come here with a fun crew.   In my opinion, cocktails are the order of the night here. They have a great selection of good drinks. The beer selection doesn't do it for me, and the wine list is interesting, but not engaging at all price points. There are some stunning options on the higher end (including a relatively reasonably priced offering from Sine Quo Non!!), but the sub-$80 range is pretty flat.   The food ... where to begin? I'm not sure you can miss on the food menu. Everything we've ever had has been enjoyable- at worst! The meatloaf (seriously!!) is consistently a favorite, but I just don't think there is a bad option.   Lastly, the service has always been prompt and courteous. They accommodate special requests without batting an eye and always make you feel welcome. You do need to do YOUR part and make a reservation, though. It's not always necessary, but sure helps.",

It's one of the finest restaurants in Arizona and the country, with superb food, wonderful service, and sensible prices for truly creative, exciting dishes.   They have one of the best happy hours around, and it's seven days a week! Drinks are really reasonable, appetizers are widely varied and consistently delicious.   The restaurant itself is in a rather small, relaxing, laid-back setting, while oozing an easy feeling of class and sophistication. Nothing about the place or its people is pretentious.   I recommend it to anyone who wants to be assured you'll have a delightful dining experience, so much so that you'll want to keep going back, as we do!",

Very well balanced with a solid cut piece of clear ice properly tempered to not crack. As the drink diluted slowly it only got more and more enjoyable. I tried the braised short ribs with a glass of Sangiovese. It was delicious. The short ribs were super tender and the parsnip puree was awesome. They were seasoned with a hint of nutmeg which gave it a Wintery holiday warmth kind of flavor. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Finished off with the lemon pie and a cup of coffee. Great way to end our stay in Phoenix. Highly recommend coming here!",

Although we were only getting drinks, there was no pressure to get food. She was very knowledgeable and helpful! I couldn't decide which bourbon drink I wanted.

For instance, they have meatloaf on the menu which is probably much more amazing than an average meatloaf.   I got the shrimp cocktail, mixed nuts and olives. My friend got the heirloom popcorn with bacon bits in it and the fondue with pretzel bread.      The fondue had a delicious cheese sauce, smokey sausage which was lean and flavorful as well as pears, which was a unique and flavorful combination.  The olives were nice and firm the way I love them. The nuts had a light sugar glaze. The popcorn had a True gourmet taste.   Adam was our server and he did a great job differentiating menu items. My friend was debating amongst a few items. He mentioned that one entree was a little smaller portion than the others which was very thoughtful. And he really seemed to have a very good understanding of the nuances of fine food and cocktails.   I had club soda with bitters but next time I'll try the oak aged cocktails because they sounded unique and interesting kind of like a fine wine.    I'm really looking forward to returning.  Tip: Make a reservation even if it's early, otherwise you might not get in.",

I know there's a lot of things on the menu that I would love to try so I'll definitely be coming back my next time I'm in Scottsdale!    Oh and I had some olives too since they were on happy hour.

Starters are large and shareable. Entrees are large. Service is always on point and we especially love sitting at the bar.   Happy hour here is one of my favorites!  Everyday (including weekends!) with great discounts on wine, beer and even their barrel aged cocktails are half price.  Many snacks on special as well.  Entrees are seasonal and there is often a special. Many of the starters are menu staples and worth checking out including the Chopped Salad and Bernie's Mac and cheese! Other than happy hour, I find this to be more of a special occasion or date night restaurant due to price.  Also great for business meals.",

Now our group likes to order appitizers galore, maybe even make a meal out of them, and we did just that plus a couple mains and shared the lot of it. The original chop salad was one of the things suggested and digested, and we thought \"A-ok\" but truly loved the meatloaf and mac & cheese more. The scallops were also notable!   Calories and conversations here were the start of solidifying the new team CARL. May mean nothing to you, but watch out world, we're changing it up and cheers-ed here to start.

Before we left on the trip I checked the area via Yelp and found the Citizen Public House. I looked over the menu and reviews and it seemed like the perfect spot for us, so I made a reservation.   We arrived and were greeted warmly with smiles and shown to our table. We ordered some house cocktails, which were really balanced and well made. I highly recommend their house Manhattan.   We started with their Burrata, which was perfect, then two of the three of us ordered the Filet Mignon entree, while our other friend ordered the duck. All were very generous portions and cooked to perfection. The filet with the shallot marmalade and sweet potato mash was really delicious. We ended with a couple desserts, which we shared. They were tasty.  If you're looking for a quality place for dinner and drinks in the area, but don't want it to be stuffy and uptight, this is your spot. It hit on all marks!

This place seems to be in the heart of old town, not good for a date night or group dinner that wants to chit chat, you can hardly hear yourself breathe it is so loud. But, minus the craziness in this place, love the din lighting and southwest feel it has. The servers were super helpful and patient with our group of 6.   We ordered almost everything on the menu as it all looked so good! What I will say is DO order the chopped salad. Whatever is in there is absolute crack! I could've ate five of those things if I could. So simple yet is packed with so much flavor, I believe it's couscous that's in this salad...simply amazing! Bacon Mac n cheese and burrata were also good apps to start, perfect amount of cheese and other flavors in both dishes.  The filet mignon asada tacos were to die for! Also, another crack dish. They come with three and roasted corn on the cob, the meat is amazing and also comes with cotija cheese. The meatloaf with mashed potatoes was cooked to perfection, filet mignon with purple sweet potato mash was different and a great mix, the scallops were ok, not as much flavor as we had hoped but enjoyed the grits it came with, and the short ribs were absolutely perfect! Peeled right off and topped with some tasty sauce. Mind you, these are all dishes that are great for sharing amongst the table, best restaurant in Scottsdale!",

The menu offers everything from their famous chop salad ( you seen it before at cowboy ciao) to amazing short ribs.  The cocktail menu is quite unique and the wine list offers a lot of range.  Great HH or CPH as they call it 3 - 6 daily.  What I like best is the size of the menu and the fact that you can spend anywhere from 10 to 25 on an entree depending on your mood.  It's a little tough to find tucked on a side street but do not miss this great addition to old town Scottsdale.  Matt C",

Interior decor is classic fine dining elegance with minimalist qualities. R and D is the upstairs speakeasy joint, you should definitely check that out as well, after dinner. Be sure to check with the host on getting up to R and D as that part can be tricky. When I first went to Cit pub almost a year ago I was enticed by their Moscow Mule served traditionally in a copper cup, with a garnishing of a sugar sucker. It's a very good mule. I tried the chop salad and while all my girlfriends die over it, it's not my thing. I didn't enjoy the separation of flavors and didn't overall like the ingredient mix, but I'm sort of particular so I encourage you to try that salad for yourself. It's pretty famous. I had the chicken entree which has a delicious sauce, was not dry, and had a lovely hash type bean and brussel sprout thing on the bottom of the plate. It was amazing, definitely a step up from not loving the salad last time. I paired it with their better rose available by the glass. Wonderful meal and highly recommend eating at this restaurant soon.",

Nothing much to look at from the outside, but were pleasantly surprised, open and comfortable. My husband and I sat at the bar, ordered a few appetizers: Pork Belly Pastrami and Crab Cakes w/ brussel sprout slaw....sorry, I drifted off thinking about how outstanding and delicious they were! Thomas our bartender who knew EXACTLY how every dish was perpared and expaining w/ such passion, we can tell he loves what he does! Next time the reservation will be here! Looking forward to trying EVERYTHING! Hope Thomas is working!",

    "text": "I came here shortly after they opened for the Yelp preview. I didn't want to write a review on that for a few reasons; mainly because it wasn't a True dining experience. The food and the cocktails were so awesome that night and the staff was amazingly friendly... I don't know what took me so long to come back.  At the Yelp event, I love love love loved the lamb meatball (which seems to actually be the lamb burger on the menu) and the smart chicken. It was late night and I wasn't starving, so wanted to choose a smaller plate. I have a friend who once told me, \"If a restaurant has crab cakes on the menu, order them. If the crab cakes are good, then you know it's a good restaurant.\" I saw crab cakes on the menu and thought of what he said. Now, I already knew this restaurant creates great food so didn't need to use the crab cakes as an indicator. I don't normally go for seafood items, but had crab cakes once that were delicious in DC and always wanted to taste crab cakes that good since then. I figured there was a good chance these crab cakes might give those DC cakes a fun for their money and I was so right. They were sooooooooo good. I'm still thinking about them and will be letting my crab cake loving friend know he's missing out if he doesn't ever get to eat these.  Oh yeah, do you know they have a sausage of the day? Citizen Public House is awesome.  Each month they have a cocktail pairing dinner that I keep meaning to get to. I love to drink and I love to eat. Smartest idea ever to pair foods with cocktails rather than cocktails to food. So far they've only been on nights where I have to work the next day; which explains why I haven't been to one yet. I'm just going to have to give in and use a vacation day for the following day for an upcoming dinner.  The only thing they need to do in order to completely have my heart is serve weekend brunch. Once they do that, they will become my steady restaurant boyfriend.",

After some hard work and serious wedding partying we dined at CPH. Gary, our waiter, could have made Taco Bell seem like a good idea but instead he was working with some seriously well executed victuals. The much overused pork belly got new life with their pastrami pork belly presentation. The oft mentioned chopped salad was really that good. Make sure you try their scallops. Six east coast food pros loved them... those who whine \"How can you get seafood in the desert\" need to simply accept that jets exist and quiet down. And then there was the short ribs entree. Lusciously braised then magically seared to form a crust. By the time you get to CPH the menu will have changed. If the staff remains, especially Gary, have no fear, a great meal is here!",

Stacie, the event manager is outstanding; her attention to detail included several renditions of the menu/format as I changed my mind many times and then the night of the event she and Zach and Chris and Owen (what a team!) babysat my video, attended to our every need and made it perfect for me to entertain my guests.  Pretty sure they polished 450,001 wine glasses! And the food was delicious: seared scallops were plump and nicely crusted, the filet was tender and so super meaty I asked Chef Ben if he added umami.  And then of course killer desserts.  Kudos to the young guys that own the place: their professionalism and passion permeates everything and everybody.",

My girlfriend ordered the lamb burger and I was extremely jealous. My chicken was ok, it didn't blow me away, but the burger was amazing. The third in our group ordered the ribs and they were also fantastic. The meat just fell off the bone, was very tender, and had a lot of flavor. We'll definitely be coming back, and next time I'll get the burger.",

All six of us were very pleased with our choices, which inckuded meatloaf, trout, crab cakes, filet or osso buco. Good wine selection. (Specials during happy hour.). One of us made an interesting observation: there was no salt and pepper on the table. But they weren't needed, since everything was seasoned perfectly. Alas, we had no room for dessert.

The short ribs, kale and sauce was amazing however the mashed potatoes was way too syrupy and thin. I think they added this sweet sauce to the mashed potatoes. Someone ordered the mashed potatoes as a side and it was very good not like the side on my plate. The rack of lamb came almost raw and wasn't sent back because she was too shy. The beans under the lamb were hard.  She did try to tell the waiter she didn't like them and he promptly brought the exact same beans to the table. She sent those back and got the mashed potatoes. The grapefruit salad was amazing. The meatloaf was truly amazing. Best ever anywhere! Mac N Cheese was very good not great. The waiter delivered a hard sugar cookie packaged in plastic wrap for the birthday guest. It was what you would expect from Subway yet not as good. The service was very good. There was a waiter in the corner watching our table at all times. All we had to do was look up. Very cool. On the whole the experience was very good not great.",

He definitely helped us in making decisions and making it easy to be a first time customer. He had suggested the chopped salad and we weren't disappointed in the slightest. Also, he gave me the best Shirley Temple I've ever had. He had given us a complimentary box of two little red velvet truffles for our anniversary and my boyfriend almost ate mine, they were so good.  Even if the food wasn't as fantastic as it is, we would go back because of him.   I suggest the Short Ribs with the cherry BBQ sauce. It was probably the best meal I've had in a very long time. It's immensely flavorful and will surprise your taste buds. My boyfriend had the Meatloaf and couldn't get over how delicious it was.   The atmosphere is high class mixed with a bit of rusticity and had a comfortable feel. The staff is immensely friendly and helpful. It is a bit pricy, both our meals came to $93. Definitely worth it for a date night or special occasion.   This is by far my new favorite resturaunt. If you haven't been, you should definitely go.",

I had the Applewood Smoked Duck for my entree, accompanied by a glass of the Siduri pinot from Willamette.  The wine was perfect with the cherry sauce, besides the fact that pinot is a classic pairing with duck.  A glass of Siduri for $12 is a great deal, too.  I loved the way the duck was prepared, too, and it did not weigh me down afterwards like duck often can, either.  My wife had the buttermilk roasted chicken along with a glass of their creative (and delicious) interpretation of sangria.  Roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet corn are part of the presentation.    Dessert was the decadent Dream Pudding Jar.  We always get excited about an original dessert dish, and this one did not disappoint.  Service was top notch all the way, also.",

They are as great as everyone says they and you will want to order \"one of everything\" - and that's okay.  I started with the Citi-Zen as the waiter said it was their most popular and I was not disappointed. I followed that up with a traditional Pisco Sour - I say traditional because they include a RAW EGG in their recipe - just like the pisco sours in South America!  The menu is slightly lacking in the 'vegetarian' department, but to be fair our waiter did offer up an off-the-menu risotto type dish for my honey and I.  Instead, we ordered this grilled cheese type sandwich. Okay, but get this, the cheese itself is grilled. Its this weird/awesome Middle Eastern cheese that doesn't melt easily so they put a thick cheese slice on the grill! YUM!!   Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable in both the food and cocktail menu and brought us out a complimentary dessert for our anniversary.The decor itself was kind of plain and lacked in the ambiance department - but after two or three Pisco Sours, who cares?!",

I was probably running to the restroom every 5 minutes or so.  Our server (forgive me, but I didn't catch the name during my sprints to the loo) was awesome.  She gave me several bitters and ginger in an attempt to calm my stomach and offered some other options I could pick up at the drugstore.  Unfortunately, nothing worked, but the fact that she gave a damn how I was feeling was cool in my book.  Oh, and the bitters and ginger were really tasty...too bad they didn't stay down for long.  Anyway, I can comfortably say these restrooms are nicely decorated...just wish I didn't have to spend all dinner there.",

If you don't know what that is, it's likely because you're not from MN, and quite possibly have never visited. The bartender was just as excited as I was to have this available to order, I thought it was just a Minnesota thing. He confirmed it was, but the cook was from Minnesota. Ok now it all makes sense! Lol It tasted amazing, almost as good as the 5-8 club in my hometown! Thanks for bringing a little Minnesota happiness to the valley! Can't not say something about the amazing service and definitely felt the \"Minnesota nice\" vibe!",

I was in T-shirt and jeans which seemed a bit underdressed because people were in dress shirts and ladies in nice blouses.   Food:  I ordered Scallops and a beer.  Scallops - Cooked to perfection.   Service:  I sat by the bar and didn't really need much service. The bartenders were fairly attentive though dropping by every now and then to see if I wanted another beer.   Environment:  Great first date spot. Heck there were 3 couples in the bar area that seemed like it was their first date. Good food with loud vibes. Dress to impress type of restaurant.

It took 20 minutes and came out with a single chicken breast that was overcooked, dry and very bland with literally three Brussels sprouts cut in half. The small portion of risotto was fine, but the chorizo sauce was more like 2 teaspoons of Frank's hot sauce drizzled on the plate.  This meal wasn't worth $10. Much less what they charge for it. The beer was a good happy hour price. If you like it happy hour drinks this place is alright.",

It took him quite a long time to even come over to our table after we had been seated, and when he did he seemed to be annoyed that he had to wait on us. Maybe because we didn't all order entrees or some of us were sharing things...we were never offered a dessert menu. When it was time to settle the checks the server was rude to one member in the party about being ready to pay. I guess the best part of the night was eating the chopped salad that everyone raves about.",

    "text": "Disappointed. Based on rave reviews a group of friends booked a dinner. Upon arrival, the restaurant was busy, not crazy, but there was a lack of ambience of energy. I found the decor, layout and lighting uninspiring for a place with such raves in a trendy part of town. Onto the food..The portions are small. I felt like I was in an upper east side restaurant in Manhattan where skinny women eat. The beet salad was a frisee salad that had a few chunks of beets. If they were fresh, I couldn't have told you. The appetizers aka bar snacks  arrived at same time as our first course salads. That defeats the point of ordering something to snack on. It was olives, it didn't need to be cooked. And again, if they were fresh and unique, I couldn't tell you. Entrees are pitifully small for the price. Portions of them were yummy, but the scallops arrived with a cooked greens, stems attached and all of us were pulling them from our mouth. If it's on the plate it should be edible. Cut the stems off in the kitchen please. The meatloaf appeared to be the best entee of the 5 we tried. Dessert was the mini size, the 3 tablespoons of mousse side.  This is a pub..  I know it's an upscale pub but if I was expecting to healthier size portions. Service was attentive initially, multiple servers. We were talking asked if we wanted coffee with desserts, we were not askecif we wanted a second cocktail. Our waters were filled.  But hey, based on these reviews, it was like I walked into the wrong restaurant.",

    "text": "CPH for short has always delivered an exceptional dining experience from beginning to end.  This visit I strayed from the norm- the must try Scallops that are 4 huge scallops with a side of corn grits (yes it works trust me), some greens and what gives it that pop or taste is the homemade cola reduction that is drizzled on.  This is by far one of my top scallop dishes ever tasted.  But for this evening, we (the fiancee) got there early and took advantage of the happy hour.  The rosemary salted nuts where good and flavor was great.  Order the fondue which came with a nice side of break and some jerky.  Cheese was great and didn't become to hot like some places that have to much heat underneath the cheese.  Final appetizer was the pork belly pastrami.  Again, nailed it with layers of flavor, even from the slight hint of mustard at the end.  Not to mention a very tender pork belly.  Next the chopped salad which I've had at least 5 times.  Won't go into detail but the ingredients are so different they have their own Facebook page!   Entrees for me was the Fair Trade Short Ribs and my significant other just had the macaroni and cheese side.  Short Ribs where good, maybe 30 seconds less on the cooking for me- which is a personal preference.  I'm not a fan of parsnip puree, but the texture and flavor was great.  My significant other's mac and cheese was huge.  Lots of cheese flavor and lots of noodles.  For me it needed a \"pop\" of something but I can't place it.    Last, but not least, they do know how to serve a decent cocktail.  I've complained before how restaurants want to charge but not deliver, but CPH gives a real drink with real flavors.  Try their Manhattan if you like whiskey and you'll be sure to love house made bitters with the orange and cherry twist.  My fiancee had the Mia Margarita which had some nice hints of lemon and lime with a surprise salt rim that had a smokey taste.",

This glorious \"salad \" is mixed right in front of you and it's one of the greatest culinary experiences of my life . That's right . You experience this salad . It's so good if you order it as an appetizer you may quickly find yourself ordering another as your entree . This is the Michael Jordan of all salads . If someone told me last year I'd be singing the praises of a salad with a page long post today I'd question if there's a new burger called salad in the future . If you live within 100 mile radius make the trip here to order this .",

Two other restaurants, The Gladly and Cowboy Ciao, also serve the same salad. However, The Gladly and Cowboy Ciao do not have the same menu items.  One of the best items on the Citizen Public House menu are the crab cakes. They're a bit pricy, but what crab cake isn't? It's one of the crab cakes that has a solid amount of crab in it which you rarely find anymore with restaurants trying to keep food costs down.  I have been coming here for years and the menu has recently changed. The staples have remained, but the drink menu has a few new options that are all fantastic. There is a rum drink on the menu that is extremely strong, and extremely tasty. A few of those and you won't remember the dinner conversation! Definitely one of the best Phoenix restaurants with fantastic service and knowledgeable wait staff.",

Get it with the smoked salmon.  It was large enough to be a meal.  Tasty, refreshing, great texture.  Just excellence.  The chia crusted tuna was rather weak.  It was almost like it came from a different kitchen.  The flavor, texture, and temp were all displeasing for me.  For 30 bucks this piece of tuna should have been WAY better.  The drinks were pretty decent but not 12 dollars worthy.  Bottom line is I would come back for the salad and only the salad.  If I was hungry after the chopped salad then I would order another chopped salad.  Oh yeah, everyone that stated it is loud is correct.  My right ear is still ringing.  I think it is the acoustics in the building.  We had to shout to each other right across the table and the place was only half full.",

The wait staff was friendly and the place was clean.  Very busy place in old town Scottsdale right in the middle of everything and not far from all the bars.  The original chopped salad was amazing!! I've never had anything like it! I would go back again just for the salad!  The short ribs were good and you can fork it off without a knife but I felt like it was a bit dry.  Flavored were good though.  The mash potato was sweet underneath.. Which I wasn't a fan of but I suppose it goes well with the short rib flavor and the coffee compote sauce.  The mint chocolate budino was a little too sweet for me and the mint taste wasn't apparently strong.  The cookie on top was frozen and really hard to break into to share.  The desserts here were not my favorite but a big win with that chopped salad.  The smoked salmon and pesto dressing made the flavors but the kale, sunflower seeds and some black fruit gave it a crunch!  I want it again already!  I liked the salad so much I went back the next day before my flight to get the chopped salad to go so I can eat it for dinner on my way home!!! Loved it and couldn't stop thinking about it!!",

I had a friend meet me, and then his girlfriend,and I think we pretty well covered the menu from appetizers to entrees.  Was surprised by the rosemary roasted nuts (simple concept, fantastic result) and the duck was excellent (millet really complimented the meal).    Great place for a date or to grab a drink.  I am a male and a heathen one at that, so for five stars I'd like to see a television at the bar.",

We did order two dishes, and they were good, but I guess it's just nothing we would ever crave.  We were here for a friend's birthday, and we did look at the menu online a few days earlier. Even then, nothing jumped out at us.  Our friends did seem to enjoy their meals though!  I would recommend looking at the menu first.

I am at the point where I want to bring everyone I know to this place after trying it out. I came in with 2 of my closest friends for a birthday around 8pm. It was busy but they were still able to seat us right away. I had my 2 month old baby with me. I am breastfeeding so it is hard to leave him at home and as many moms know at that age they really don't have a set bed time. The host staff was so welcoming and instead of being weirded out that I brought an infant carrier into a gastro pub they responded with excitement and loved seeing my little one. After we were seated the service was just wonderful. The server (I wish I remembered his name- I think Alex) was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. We had a couple small dishes, the fabulous chop salad, and dessert. This review is a little late (we dined in November) but it needed to happen. If you haven't been here YOU NEED TO GO!!",

For entrees we got the buttermilk chx (very juicy) and the shortrib (bbq sauce was on point) and both were solid. For dessert we got both the chocolate bread pudding and the to-go bacon pecan brittle and neither hit the spot, I almost wish I didn't eat them. Service was outstanding however. I would come back if in Scottsdale again.",

CPH is comfort food taken to the next level. Whether you order the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn (don't fear it, it's awesome) or the chicken and waffles, taste bud satisfaction is the norm at this place.   I think the reason I keep coming back, despite the excellent food and amazing white sangria is the amazing service. Whether it's a busy Saturday night, or an early dinner on a weekday I am continually impressed with their level of knowledge and service at CPH. It's how a restaurant experience should be, and it's consistently amazing, just like the food. A plus also is they offer Gluten-Free options for my celiac sister. Believe me she is very hard to please, but CPH always puts her at ease when it comes to the GF options. Go to CPH and I promise you will not be disappointed.  What I love to order: white sangria, original chopped salad, pan seared scallops",

I know what you're all thinking... \"but Kristi...you don't look a day over 34&3/4.\" Stop....no, pleassssseeee enough with the flattery folks. I can't take it anymore. No seriously. Keep going..  Turns out CPH is right up there with the likes of Nobuo at Teeter House and FnB when it comes to quality and experience. Excellent wine selection. Please, if you have the opportunity, try the 'Tender Belly' bacon fat heirloom popcorn. It was delicious. Though bacon fat could probably make dog poo tasty.   I enjoyed the Porcini-dusted Filet Mignon, medium rare and had a couple of nibbles of my fiance's scallops (which were amazing). The Filet was cooked to perfection and though I'm somewhat of a purist and usually prefer my steak 'au-natural' I was beyond satisfied with the accoutrement. Impressed even.   The service was phenomenal. The distress surrounding my age caused me to consume a gigantic Ketel martini, a shit load of wine (local by the way, I love that) and a desert drink and not once was I cut off. Truly though, our server was a doll. Engaging and genuine; something obviously lacking in the service industry in Arizona.   The only thing I would change about CPH is the location and that's only due to my location, so I'll deal with it.",

Due to what was apparently a miscommunication, CPH only wanted to allow our party to order from a set menu.  Many of us were not interested the set 4-course meal, and wanted food/drinks from the regular menu.  The management was not willing to allow this - since we didn't order from the fixed menu, they charged our group a $500 surcharge.   So, CPH got $500 from our group (instead of the much larger fare had they allowed us to order from the normal menu.    But that will be the LAST penny CPH will ever see from me.    Saddle House, on the other hand, took great care of our large group at a moments notice.  We ate and had drinks there all night, including some freebies thrown in because they appreciated our business.",

The servers I spoke to were all very knowledgeable about the menu.  I am not sure I could pick one meal over the other next time.  I liked them both so much.

Staff gave great recommendations and I ended up ordering the famous chopped salad and truffle grilled cheese along with some bread and olive oil on the side.  Overall thoughts - chopped salad was good (it has its own Facebook URL) but not amazing. Solid 4/5 stars. As for the truffle grilled cheese it was the same - good 4/5 stars but felt that a little more cheese would've made it even more melt in your mouth.  I'd definitely come back.

His easy going demeanor and sense of humor make CPH look good and he could teach lessons to some waiters I've known.   CPH makes their own barrel cocktails aged and flavored right in the restaurant. We were undecided on which to try ($5 each during happy hour, usually $12) so Matt brought us a sample of each. All were interesting and unique and we ended up ordering the Negroni, the Pyrat Eye the Craftsman along with an appetizer of rosemary nuts and green olives. Great way to start a meal!  Our dishes included the Seared Scallops (heaven on a plate), the Fried Bologna Sandwich (delicious mortadella and pistachios) and the Grilled Lamb Loin (perfectly cooked and seasoned). Dinner cocktails included the Citi-Zen, a pear vodka concoction topped with rock candy; the Hot Pink Paloma, a paloma with a light, zesty pepper taste; and a Persian, made with wild tea vodka and cucumber...super refreshing!  Finished dinner with Irish Coffee and a take home bag of bacon brittle.   While dining we noticed two employees putting two tables together for a party and actually taking the time to adjust the lighting so as to make sure none of the ceiling lights would be in any of the incoming diners eyes. Impressive and caring enough to make sure all the details were right.",

I saw Citizen on yelp and had my eye on it but was a bit tainted because my friend and I have bad experiences with \"gastropubs\" or at least the ones in Cali. It always turned out to be horrible tasting food that tries tooooo cool and overpriced... we took the leap of faith and said fck it lets do it, maybe Scottsdale gastropubs will be different, and indeed it was!  We couldn't get reservations (place is packed for a good reason) but the hostess said there were bar seats available, and we were cool with that. We just wanted food in and out. Also it was fight night, all the other bars were charging $20 each, why not spend that money on good food instead?   I couldn't believe how good the food tasted here. I was in shocked because... well it's Scottsdale, wasn't sure if this was a foodie mecca. Citizen (and amongst other places) proved me wrong. We decided not to stuff our faces and instead get 2 apps and 1 entrees.  -Chia Seared Tuna: the best seared tuna and most creative seared tuna I've tried thus far...and I eat out a lot (1130+ reviews). The chia seeds were unique and gave it an amazing crunch! Put that with the asparagus puree, black-like rice and a spicy puree...it was a burst of flavors in your mouth. We licked the plate clean. -Crabcakes: For a landlock town, they sure weren't stingy on the crab meat! Every bit had crab and the breading was at a minimal so you actually tasted the crab!The aioli was also good on it but it was flavorful itself you probably didn't need it! -Pork Osso Buco: We usually have lamb, but pork is also a good alternative. The pork by itself is dry, but if you actually mix all the flavors it was not at all dry and had sooo many flavors. The polenta that tasted like butter and cheese with the roasted tomatoes and kale... it literally made my mouth melt and fall in love with this dish. The kale was cooked perfect! I can eat this everyday.   Everything we had that night was excellent. This place sure was not the hype. Service was great, good was great, company was great... I think this is as good as it gets in Scottsdale for dinner... put this in SD and it'll be the new \"it\" restaurant. *Hint Hint* Come on over",

    "text": "How is it that I don't write reviews for places I absolutely love to go.    I think that when I truly LOVE a place, I get writer's block.  I generally don't know where to begin, so let me start with the item that drew me in.... Bacon Popcorn.  If you read my reviews, you know by now that popcorn is my favorite food.  My second favorite is bacon.  When a place takes those 2 things and puts them together in one dish, it won't take much to make me a fan, for life.  When I walk in Citizen Public House and pull up a seat at the bar, I feel like I'm in a craftsman style supper club.  The interior of the building itself is beautifully appointed, yet simple with those beautiful wooden beams.  There is a lovely patio area as well.  I've dined on several things from the menu.  I've gone for dinner with reservations and I've stumbled in late night for a bowl of popcorn and libations.    By far my favorite thing on the menu, save the Bacon popcorn, is the Chopped Salad.  I enjoy it every time I've gone.  I'm a creature of habit and it is hard for me to order something different at a restaurant when I've found something I enjoy a lot.  HOWEVER, I love it that I have some adventurous friends and I've managed to try several of their drinks and menu items.    I like the fact that they host a monthly cocktail tasting.  Come in and taste their crafted cocktails for about $65 with some food pairings.  Their drinks are adventurous, but to be honest, I've had better crafted cocktails around Phoenix.    I would give them 5 stars, but I did order something once that was not prepared correctly and I had to convince the server that it wasn't.  I didn't have to twist his arm but he tried to tell me that it was correct and etc, but I said no, I don't think so.   I suppose after the server took it to the back and examined the food item more, he discovered I was right.  They remade the item for me and the night kept going.  But that makes me wonder if the menu is being prepared correctly.  I wouldn't know, probably never will since I'm stuck on that salad. (SN: I think their chopped salad has a facebook page.)   And the menu doesn't change often enough.  Another downer is the fact that there is no audible music.  I'm on the fence if I'd want it there or not, but when I've gone, I notice I look around thinking, we could use some atmospheric music.  I also think that place would rock with a really good Jazz band playing live music there.  Please don't get me wrong, this place has excellent service.    The fact of the matter is that I will definitely be back  CPH has the chance to earn 5 stars from me.",

(And it does achieve that.) We consider ourselves foodies, but this was just too strange and the prices were over the top given the informal ambience (eg a $42 filet mignon can be a good value in certain settings-- but not this one).   I ordered the \"Socialite\", and this cocktail tasted as if made of half vinegar. (I do love vinegar but not as a cocktail: this concoction was undrinkable. Another case of trying too hard.  Did I mention the place smells like a college bar? It reeked of spilled beer even though the place was quite clean.  Maybe it's just us. Clearly we are in the minority, so give it a whirl and see what you think.",

All I can say is that the tuna was melt in your mouth delicious and had a crunchy exterior that I couldn't get enough of. Well done mr chef. Absolutely superb.   We also had the Pork Osso Buco and crab cakes. Both of which were great options and quite delightful.   Lastly, the ambiance is very dark and romantic.

I don't even like salmon, and I loved this! I also got the Pork Belly Pastrami and also enjoyed this as well. I loved the brussel sprout sauerkrout on top, and the pork belly just melted in your mouth. Pork belly can come across as overly fatty, but this was so tender, and the flavor was incredible.  Both of these dishes amazed me- so I ordered another: the Ramen with pork belly in Chinese 5-spice, shiso leaves, bean sprouts, and soft marinated egg in a pork-based stock. I didn't think the ramen was on par as the chopped salad and the pastrami, but clearly, I'm Asian. I thought the ramen more had Chinese flavor than the traditional flavor, and it felt more like a bowl of Chinese noodle soup. However, the broth was pretty tasty, and the pork belly and egg were done well. Noodles were fresh.  ...I am so sad that I live so far from here...",

One of our favorite restaurants in the Valley.  Even if they took the pork belly pastrami off the menu, I'd love this place a little less, but I'd still love.  Atmosphere, awesome.  Drinks, very good (despite loss of amazing bar program upstairs.)    More than anything, we have loved a meat-centric approach to this place, and though heavy, it is delicious.  Apart from the aforementioned pork belly pastrami, which is melt in your mouth good with the sauerkraut and mustard to cut the richness, we've also enjoyed the pork cheeks and crab cakes.  The crab cakes are juuuuuust above my cut-off for having enough lump crab in there to make it worth calling a crab cake, but it has made it, and it's tasty.  Get the meatloaf, embrace the amaro.  My wife (as always) get the branzino and she loves it.  Also had the short ribs which are a little heavy-handed on the rub, enough to leave a bit of bitterness on the meat (not in a good way), but on the whole, is not a bad dish.  Tracy Dempsey does their desserts.  Enough said.    So from atmosphere to drinks to food, this is definitely one of the best casual fine dining joints the Valley has to offer.",

The cocktails are unique and delicious (ask Thomas to make them for you, he's amazing), and the service is impeccable.  For dinner ask to sit in Sam's section; he is by far one of the most knowledgeable, on-point servers I have ever had.  All of his recommendations have always been phenomenal and he has a cadence about him that makes you feel like he is enjoying the dining experience as much as you are.  Food standouts: Chopped Salad; Scallops; and the Tenderloin Wrap Drink standout: Manhattan; trust me on this one, it's out of this world.",

    "text": "So we went during restaurant week last Friday. And definitely had reservations, previously had tried to go to Citizen in April and it was slammed.    I loved the multiple course menu idea and to be honest I think they should do it often for certain weekends as nothing beats that. We both had the Chopped Salad, which to be honest...was amazing.  Great idea, and it sports it's own Facebook page. We also shared the drink pairing, the first one which was vodka based made sense but we really weren't that interested in it.  For the second course she had the Buttermilk chicken and I the pan seared scallops.  Both were amazing, the grits were very fine and I hate grits.  The grits were quite tasteful.  The second drink was a citrus and gin cocktail, definitely see how it went with the scallops or the chicken, it was good but no idea how it would couple with the meatloaf.  For our desert I chose the Peanut Butter Strata Bar and she the Pig In the Orchard, the peanut butter strata bar tasted as though I could ascend to heaven.  The bread pudding was ok, but the maple ice cream that came with it was decadent.  The cocktail was patron cafe based and it completely went with either deserts.    I would say the skills of the bar tender and the chef were in full display, the only thing that could have made this a five star night would have been our waiter being way more attentive.  He gets a pass as it seemed they needed more wait staff, so given how many patrons he had he did good work.",

The service is good, they fill your empty water glass quite often and check on you if your cocktail is empty. But the main point is cocktail and food.  The cocktails are good but not up to the standards as mentioned. Its a two way street where the server/bartender understand what you like and dislike. You explain them and they serve what you like.   It didn't happen even after explaining a lot. I had to order Scotch on the rocks, even that was served with too much of ice,  after mentioning less ice. They should at least understand how to serve Scotch.  Coming to food. I am still hungry. I am not complaining about the portions, but the quality of the food itself. We had to force eat food because we were really hungry. Appetizer were somewhat good.  Everyone have different opinions, but this is my take on the place. Peace!!",

    "text": "We first went to Citizen for \"happy hour\" apps and cocktails, because I was intrigued by the online reviews and always want to try something new.  We had the mac and cheese and the \"other\" chopped salad.  (Not the famous one.)  I had a pisco sour (good) and a gin cocktail off their menu (I wasn't crazy about it.)  BF had Stellas.  We wanted to sit on the patio, which was a bit sterile.  Just a little color please.  The bartender who waited on us was friendly, knowledgeable, kind, and great.  Host was great too!  The salad and mac and cheese we ate were very tasty.  If you are looking for a value, go to Bungalow or somewhere else, because, as my BF says \"Happy Hour is supposed to be less that $40 :)\"  Citizen wasn't, but we decided it woudl be a better dinner place.   I prevailed and...       We bought a $100 gift certificate, which came with a complimentary $25 certificate.  We went back for dinner the next week with my sister and her husband who were visiting from Washington.  It was exceptionally quiet on a Friday night, which might have contributed to the restaurant feeling a bit sterile.  We all agreed the space needed some more division as it felt a bit \"cafeteria.\"  Maybe skip the white tablecloths.  (We were just brainstorming  They don't seem very \"gastro pub\".)  The menu was very interesting and although, our server was not as exceptional as the bartender we had the first time, she was very nice.  We had the popcorn and original chopped salad to start.  The popcorn was greasier than I thought and not as flavorful.  I still liked it and enjoyed more than enough of it.  More bacon pieces, less bacon grease please.  The salad was FABULOUS!  Now I know why it is famous.  I would come back for this salad any day.  Great presentation.  Great taste.  For entrees we had the pork, grilled cheese, ribs, and pastrami.  The pork had excellent accompaniments and was cooked almost perfectly.  Love the figs!  The ribs were rated a 9.5.  Delic!  The grilled cheese was said to be on a brioche and was served on white bread and was somewhat underwhelming.   The pastrami was a starter portion  (which was fine) and was NOT a good cut of meat.  Because it was a small portion of meat, it was apparent, 1/2 of the portion of pastrami was pure fat.  Yucky.  The spaetzle was okay.  The brussell sprout kraut was okay.  (This was my dish if you can't tell :).  Underwhelming.  I had the Manhattan which was excellent and the champagne cocktail which was quite tasty.  Sister is prego and had water and tea.  Brother had vodka and the rocks and BF had beer.  Desert was a bread pudding to share which was tasty, but not quite as interesting as the menu would lead you to believe.  Cappuccino was EXCELLENT!  We like this place.  I want it to succeed.  I don't know if they need to throw some rugs on the floor, to put a room divider next to a table or what, but they need to make it feel like a gastropub if that is what they want it to be.  Right now it feels like they are lost somewhere between fine dining and I'm not sure.  Focus on the menu.  And the good servers.  Add some more decor.  And the quality.  And we will be back.  Good.  Almost great.",

In entrees, we order Mediterranean Sea Bass n Flat Iron Steak. Steak was perfectly cook but star was Sea Bass. It was so beautiful n perfectly cooked. We wl visit again. It's a must visit place.",

We were seated quickly as we did have reservation and our server was pretty awesome. Some of our friends actually knew the guy which was cool and we received an industry discount which was really nice and not expected at all. I didn't drink that night since I was the driver, but I heard the drinks were great just a bit on the small side.   As for the food I tasted a bit of everything. For apps we had the pork belly pastrami (a bit too fatty), chopped salad (awesome), fernet steak salad (not a fan too sweet for my taste). For entree's I had the scallops which were good not the greatest and I shared the duck with my friend which I liked better than the scallops which were quite rich. My husband had the crispy stealhead which I really liked, but he was not that keen on it. Our other friends had the chicken and waffles, mac n cheese, and lamb burger and they said they were all fantastic minus the fries which I tried and were a very strange texture almost like they were rolled in cornmeal not 1 of us liked those at all.   All in all it was a nice place with great service and good food, but a little over priced for the taste and quality of the food.  For this many stars on yelp I was expecting City Hall experience and my tastebuds to be dancing with excitement. I would recommend for gathering with friends and would go back!",

    "text": "Citizen Public House is one of my most favorite restaurants in Scottsdale and definitely on one of my tops just overall.  I had been taken here by some colleagues who are more local to the area and I've gone back a good 3 times because I just like it that much.  Every time I go there I am always pleased with the waiting staff and they always make the experience that much more delightful.  The first time I went there I had their meatloaf, which some people either hear as \"Ew\" or some go \"I only eat my mom's\".  I do not want to knock any mother's out there, but this meatloaf was absolutely phenomenal!  Our server, Gary, recommended it to us and I've never viewed meatloaf the same.  My boy, Gary and my boy Sam are both super legit and just awesome servers, you should ask to sit in their sections.  I usually look forward to off menu items as well after getting an off menu lamb shank.  For those looking to start the meal off right you must go with the Original Chopped Salad.  It is mind blowing!!  Also for those looking for a vice, my drink of choice is the Import which is Jameson with Port, Guinness Foam and Tobacco Bitters, I make sure to always get that every time I go.  Citizen will not disappoint, if you are visiting and have no idea where to eat, you must eat here.  I make sure to always bring out of towners to Citizen for a good meal.  Cheers!",

I have found that some Scottsdale restaurants can sometimes have some stuffy/uppity type of service (I'm better than you vibe at times.) Not the case here! Everyone is always so friendly and accommodating and they aim to please. Saturday was super busy and a packed restaurant - food quality or presentation didn't suffer at all because of it and neither did the service. Highly recommend the fondue starter and osso bucco. I would however like to see a couple more Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc options on the white wine by glass menu. All in all it doesn't matter! All around great. Keep it up, CPH! I will continue to frequent when I'm in Scottsdale.",

Our server let us sample some barrel cocktails, which was helpful because they were strong and I didn't end up buying a drink I wouldn't have been able to drink.  They give you free bread.  Not a big deal you say?  Maybe not, but I've been to a lot of nice restaurants that make you starve while waiting for your food, so it is nice when a place doesn't nickel and dime you into starvation.  Am I right?  So we had the fondue for an appetizer and some happy hour cocktails. If you like Swiss cheese, you'd dig the fondue, otherwise maybe choose something else.  The Cherry tart pinot noir is fab IMHO.  So I bit the bullet and ordered the chopped salad.  OMG.... nosh-a-licious!  It was really, really good.  The mixture of textures and flavors was so satisfying and, I'm not going to lie, I don't get all that jazzed up over salads usually.  My husband had the special - the fillet burger - and I'm pretty sure his eyes rolled into the back of his head in delight.  I believe the exact quote was, \"This is the best burger I've ever had\".  I have seen how many burgers this man has eaten, and trust me, that is high praise.  Service - five stars!  Food - five stars!  Drinks - Five again.  Would come back here happily.",

Citizen Public House met all our needs and exceeded every expectation.  For starters, they have a TON of gluten free items.  I don't mean salad and broiled chicken.  I mean battered pork fingers and corn waffles.  We were thrilled, major bonus!  Then, the meatloaf was amazing - not traditional mushy meat loaf but not so \"out there\" that the toddler wouldn't eat it, so another huge bonus there. Finally, the noise level was just right - we could talk without yelling, didn't hear anyone else's conversations, but there was still plenty of sound and buzz so that it felt totally crowded and fun...and the little guy could make some noise without disturbing anyone else. The server was excellent, the busser brought our straws out neatly on a napkin.  Food came out quickly but not so fast that it felt like we were being rushed.  Service was attentive and polite and everyone treated my kids like guests, not pests which I really appreciate since they order as much as adults do and I expect that they should be treated as customers. Thanks Citizen Public House for a great evening out for the whole family!",

They have a large bar and the dining area wraps around it. We did not have reservations so sat at the bar for about 20 minutes before our table was ready. The bar experience was the BEST part.  I had the Citi-zen signature (lemon drop) it was AMAZING!  It comes with a stick of rock candy as well.  My husband also thought his drink was one of the best cocktails he has ever had... We also snacked on some bacon fat popcorn which was super tasty. Once seated we had really great service, but the food was lacking. I had a pork sandwich that was just average at best and not very hot.  My husband had the meatloaf, which was good, but slightly overcooked and pretty small considering the price.  I did end the night with the black and tan dessert and it would be one of my favs along with Gallo Blancos chocolate pudding for best desserts in the valley.  So my suggestion is hit up happy hour, grab a few drinks & apps and finish off with the black and tan dessert.  Call it a night and save yourself from a disappointing entree and in the process save some serious cash..",

    "text": "Super duper place in Historic Downtown! Service was excellent. No one in our party of 7 had  empty drink glasses. Then again, it was Monday night and there were probably only 2 other parties seated. Cheese Fondue was excellent, melty and creamy. I had the grilled cheese of the day. I don't remember what the cheese was, but it had chorizo in it, not just small chunks of it, but slices of it. I am in love with the Grilled Cheese of the Day concept. I would probably order it every time. I had the Korean pear salad to go with it: spicy arugula, pecans, Asian pears with a very light vinegarette. Prices were decent, atmosphere was classy, service was great! I would go back again...except I live in Surprise.",

We started with two cocktails.  She had the Bellentini and I had the 1884 Manhattan.  I love Manhattans and this was one of the best that I have had--it was incredibly smooth and flavorful.  For our appetizer, we split the gorgonzola-emmental mac-n-cheese., and for our main courses we had the Grilled Cheese of the Day and the Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs.  Everything was incredible--including the service--and we wished we had room for an Irish Coffee and one of the many tempting desserts.",

They raved about it!  My club soda was also poured to perfection.  I think they should make it a feature on the menu. As an appetizer we had the pork belly pastrami, which is served with rye spaetzle, and brussels sprout sauerkraut.  It was delicious.  I had a little of the chopped salad.  It was delicious as always.  It is originally from the Cowboy Ciao menu, and has been a favorite of mine (and everyone else) for years.   The soup of the day was the tomato bisque, and it was very good too.  The scallops were perfectly cooked.  I sampled some of the beef short ribs.  They were some of the best ribs I have eaten in years.  I would definitely order them the next time I dine at CPH.  For dessert we shared the PB & B bread pudding.  It was the only thing that I didn't love.   It was a little dry.",

    "text": "I hate to go against the usual rating for this place, but after my experience Friday night I really don't see how a 4 star is warranted. I must say though, I do see the potential and would go back again to give it a second try, but here are my thoughts about my first experience at Citizen Public House.   First of all, we went to CPH during restaurant week for a business dinner, so part of my experience may be tainted by the reason I was there. I really felt the initial service was lacking. We wanted to change seats, but our waitress didn't come to our table for about 10 minutes, so we had to ask the hostess to move us. Then, it took another 10 minutes to clear another table, which was empty in order for us to move seats. Once we were seated at the new table, our waitress was prompt, helpful, and extremely delightful.   As far as the food goes, I was expecting to be blown away based on the reviews. My experiences at FnB and other restaurants in town completely surpassed CPH food. I did love the pork fat popcorn. I had never had something like that at a restaurant and I loved the bacon. It seems that CPH loves bacon overall as it was very present on their menu, including apple bacon bread pudding, which was just alright. I had the smart chicken which was really standard chicken and risotto. My Husband really enjoyed his scallops, but didn't like the coffee pot dessert.   So, long story short, I would give CPH a second try, but I wouldn't go running back any time soon. I'd say my experience was unique given the trend on yelp.",

Our server told us that they didn't have any house wine selections, but did recommend a red for me to try. I asked for a sample before getting a full pour and it was tasty. They seemed to have a nice list of cocktails, but nobody else in our party ordered drinks, so I can't speak to how those are.  Would definitely come back here for the salad and popcorn.",

    "text": "I have one (ok two) words: CHOPPED SALAD. Some people like to sub the smoked salmon for chicken, but I prefer the original (smoked salmon). It adds way more flavor.   The textures and flavors in this salad are unlike anything you've ever tried. The nuts and dried corn make it crunchy, the cous cous makes it soft, the the currents make it sweet and salmon make it salty, the creamy (but light) cilantro salad dressing is SO refreshing.  I order this to-go at least once a week. Order it unmixed, because it's fun (and more fresh) to mix it yourself. Even if you don't eat all of it, the salad is just as good 24 hours later (unlike a lot of salads).  If I had to eat one thing for the rest of my life... I could live off of this chopped salad. No joke. I've honestly never ordered anything but the chopped salad because it's SO good, so why would I?!",

    "text": "Warning, do not let me order. This is what happens when you let me order, which you did, exactly why I do not know except for you were kind and generous and prefer to have me participate rather than to dictate. But you should have ordered for us. See what we did when I made the decision: salad, of course the salad; pork cheeks, yum and unusual; ramen, the special of that evening; and the duck burger. Large enough to feed four people, not two, now you've done it. We are going to eat beyond well. We will eat until we can't eat any more.   This place is wildly popular, over a thousand reviews, still four and half stars. That's hard to get. It's difficult to find a table, so you suggested to walk in, so we did, and we found a perfect seating at the bar, and got tended by a professional -  not too chatty, not too cold, always approachable, and he kept your water filled with ice. Something you no longer see in San Francisco. The iced water is so passe in San Francisco. It's too Americana, and San Francisco restaurants have all gone French and German on us. Only water, still or sparkling, but no ice. Not here, here, in Trump country, they still serve good n' old American style ice water. Thank heavens.   Chopped salad, is good, and it's famous.  It's filing and unusual. Kind of reminds me of Burmese tea leaf salad, found in Burma Superstar, Mandalay and Rangoon Ruby (of SF bay area). So do that if you like tea leaf salad, and then you can do a proper compare and contrast.   Pork cheek is unusual but delicious. You and I have exact the same culinary taste. Down to that love for duck. How many times have we gone out and ordered the duck? I count the cities and states we've been to together and it scared me how high the count is, dating back the 90s, when you first met me in New Hartford Connecticut. How time flies. How many wrinkles and laughing lines we've developed over the last two decades.   Try duck burger because it's not very often you get a duck burger, and with an egg on top of the patty. Running egg yolk is finger licking delicious. Then came the ramen. It's huge and fresh. Hot soup is great for a hot day, especially if you had been under the sun a lot. I know, it sounds a tad odd, but salty hot broth is really good for such occasion.  You ordered me the pisco sour. I wanted some Peruvian drink and there the bartender make something to wow us. It's got fresh nutmeg on top. You laughed. Earlier, I had been sharing a cooking secret of mine for the perfect spaetzle and mac and cheese. \"Add nutmeg.\" I proudly announced. \"You must never forget nutmeg. Even in Banana Bread (Dominique Ansel's recipe).\" There I was, drinking a pisco sour with nutmeg. The bartender must have been following us all day long. You drank your red wine while I sipped two sips and declared that I was drunk. I was, and still am, a cheap date.  We both did not have a sweet tooth so we skipped dessert. We both were too full. We both realized that we had been eating too many meals together, sharing too many recipes together, and traveling way too often together. And now we were both getting tired together like old people do.  You paid the bill. Saying goodnight to the friendly bartender who served us this wonderful meal. We stumbled back to the hotel, all the while reminiscing about this fantastical food journey we had just been on.",

The server offered to bring some bread since the dinner was taking so long to arrive, ironically the bread arrived after the meal which didn't arrive for at least another 10-15 minutes after her offer of bread.   My husband ordered the velveeta filled burger, I had the street tacos and our friend had the filet mignonette. Both my husband and I found our food to be quite average but the filet mignon was reported to be quite good.   Be careful with the burger, the first bite has cheese literally exploding out of it. Both my husband and I were covered in hot cheese. The server was apologetic and offered to pay for dry cleaning if needed. It wasn't needed but it was a nice gesture.   All in All, we wouldn't desire to come back.",

Each dish was experimental, and brought unique flavor combinations together that complimented each other well, yet were a complete surprise. We also tried the bacon popcorn, which was also a incredible experimental. The only thing I didn't care for was the desert- which was the berry medley in a pastry w/ cornmeal. Otherwise- definitely worth checking out.",

We made it for their happy hour which I had heard was outstanding.    Our first impression was that the restaurant was very swanky.  We felt underdressed when we first walked in, we had just come from the Scottsdale mall on a Sunday and were dressed more for comfort in the Phoenix summer heat.  We were seated immediately.    I wanted to take advantage of the barrel-aged cocktails that were on happy hour (for a very good price).  I could not decide, so our server brought a sample of two of them which helped me decide.  I ended up getting the Instant Gratification which is a semi-sweet drink made of scotch, cognac, and grand marnier I think.  We ordered the Kiltlifter fondue next which neither of us were crazy about.  I'm not sure if it was the cheese or the beer, but something made it bitter.  For our entrees I got the meatloaf and she got the cubano.  We were both very pleased with our meals, however she did not like the meatloaf saying it was too dry and not very flavorful.    All in all it was a decent place with good cocktails and average food.  We were disappointed mainly because we had such high hopes from all of the reviews.  We will return for happy hour when we feel like a craft cocktail, but will probably get dinner elsewhere.",

The chopped salad was light and refreshing.  When in doubt go with the chicken. I'm glad I did. The chicken was flavorful and comforting. Others at my table had the tuna and the braised beef.  I was so satisfied I had no intention of having dessert. But they brought out a chocolate brownie with ice cream and a candle. How can I refuse that? The waiter was smooth, and surprised me!!   Thank you for a wonderful dinner. I'm definitely going back.",

We had my daughters wedding dinner here (9/5/14)  and my son coordinated everything with Owen, the Manager & the Chefs Craig & Ben. Our party was an intimate 7 and from the moment we arrived we were treated with the highest of regard. Eric the Bartender started us off with the tastiest Sangrias, followed by several courses of appetizers (the chop salad was to die for!) and finished it off with their Porcini Filet Mignon - which was truly decadence!  We were full beyond measure and they packed us with to-go boxes for what we couldn't finish.  Absolutely every dish was beautifully presented and tantalizingly delicious!! I can not thank Owen, Craig, Ben, Eric and the staff of Citizen Public House enough for making such a monumental occasion so very special and personal.",

They had a great selection of wine, cocktails, spirits, and beers. They even have the barrel aged cocktails that they make, my friend got ' The Craftsman' and it was excellent. I went with my drink of the moment, a Moscow Mule, and they had a little twist to it with cucumbers. Their drinks are on the pricier side but they have some great specials during happy hour.  Their Chopped Salad is like nothing I have ever experienced, so different from any other with unique items but the ingredients go so good together! This is their most famous item and I now know why- excellent!.  Didn't have dinner but did decide to satisfy a sweet tooth craving and got the Sticky Bun Bread Pudding and The PB & B Pudding Jar. The PB & B was soooooooo good!  Overall had a great atmosphere and I can't wait to go back and try their entrees because they sounded delicious!",

Yes, I did practically roll out of there, but very happily and extremely content!  The atmosphere at Citizen Public House continues to be chill and sophisticated. Tonight, it was bubbling with people but the tables are spread out enough that it allows each table to have their own conversation.

This place is crazy loud, had to keep shouting and saying what!!!  Things started off good with our waiter Jeremy but as the night went on and he got busier rarely saw him again. The apps and drinks were good. Watermelon salad and chopped salad were great and would order again. Was perfect for four people. My Aunt and I ordered the buttermilk chicken and my uncle had the short ribs and my wife had the scallops. The chicken... for the price was expecting something amazing but it was not. No flavor whatsoever and was a touch overcooked, same for my Aunt's chicken. We talked to Jeremy our waiter about the chicken and he said that it is considered a healthy dish... So your telling me that every healthy dish you serve has no flavor??? good to know for next time... oh wait there wont be a next time.   The other dishes were great though. My wife's scallops were great as well as my Uncle's short ribs.   It was very surprising to me the way Jeremy handled the situation with the chicken. I know that if I was waiting on a table and saw that two of my guest's had a plate of uneaten food I would have done everything I could do to make things right. Especially for the price and reputation of this place.",

    "text": "Molten drinks please.  Grand Master Mixologist Richie Moe @CitizenPubHouse whipped up a couple shots for my wonderful wife and I that brought much of the bar to a silence on a crowded Saturday night. When he heard we were celebrating our anniversary he said he'd like to make us a special drink...and he felt like burning something.  The end result was kind of like bananas foster in a shot glass.  It involved melting Mexican chocolate in a metal mixing cup, flaming 160 proof black strap rum, Richie repeatedly pouring a flaming mixture of orange liquid with blue flames from cup to cup in an arc that captured everyone's attention.  Outstanding drink with an outstanding show leading up to it.  We've been to CPH twice and had great food and outstanding drinks each time.  If I am in the mood for a cocktail, this is where I want to go. If you're in the mood to go out for drinks and a bite, this is your place. Enjoy.",

Our group was quite a handful (the drinks were flowing, therefore we were all very chatty... with everyone around us) but the server was SO nice and accommodating. None of us could decide on anything so we decided to get everything instead. My highlights...  #1: Chopped salad. Doesn't sound like much but literally THE BEST SALAD EVER. It's probably not the healthiest salad in the world, but is so so so worth it.  #2: Pan seared scallops. Perfect seared outside, nice smooth delicate inside. Delicious entree.   Overall, great bar area for mingling/happy hour and a fantastic foodie spot as well.",

    "text": "I have been to Scottsdale many times over a period of 16 years, and I live in the NYC area. As such, my standards are very high, and many times I was disappointed by what many said were \"good\" restaurants in Scottsdale. I know that sounds arrogant, but the truth is when one is used to top shelf Michelin rated restaurants, one has high standards. That being said, Citizens Public House meets the high quality of New York City.   First, the Negroni is the best I ever had. I have had Negroni in the SoHo House, Mas Farmhouse, Four Seasons Restaurant, and Le Cirque in Manhattan and Florence, Italy, which is the birthplace of the Negroni, and Citizen Public House beats them all. What did they do better? They aged the drink in barrels. It was the smoothest Negroni I ever had. The pork belly was THE best I ever had. It was not fatty and no gristle. The chopped salad was spectacular. The lamb burger was amazing - flavor bursted in my mouth with each bite.   There are no words to describe how good this restaurant is. Moreover, I was there while my father was dying in hospice. I took my mother here to get our minds off of our terrible situation. The staff was beyond extremely polite. caring and courteous. They were superb. You will not do better than Citizen Public House!",

Ah, but then we enjoyed as main dishes:  chopped salad (unique and tasty), fried chicken, lamb burger, and grilled cheese sandwich. Alas, no room for dessert. Nice cocktail menu and wines by the glass.  Noise-level is pretty intense -- combination of music and acoustics -- making it hard to have a conversation and/or hear the server at times.

The drinks are STRONG, just FYI. You can't complain about that ; )  I love Moscow Mules and they were strong and good here.  We sat at the bar and had the hummus and pita just to curb our hunger. It was good and seemed fresh. We left and decided to walk around Old Town a bit....when we got back at 7PM it was PACKED. Thank goodness we had reservations! And it was LOUD!! I have never been in such a loud restaurant. That's fine with me, but just be prepared for your waiter to have to get close and speak loudly to you.   Yes, the chopped salad is as good as everyone says. How? I don't know! I think it's the large couscous, salmon, dried fruit/seeds, and buttermilk dressing combo. Ha. I ordered the scallops which were AWESOME and I am not a huge fan of scallops. We finished with the PBandB Pudding Jar. YUM!!!   The prices are a bit high but you are also paying for the location right in Old Town Scottsdale. And FYI, you will be surrounded by some $30K millionaires. Ehh, it comes with the territory.

What we ordered: 1) Pork Belly Pastrami 2) Bacon Fat Popcorn 3) The Original Chopped Salad 4) Chicken & Waffles 5)  Burrata 6)  Grilled Halloumi Cheese 7)  Everything Bread Pudding 8)  A variety of cocktails, including The Persian  I highly recommend EVERYTHING listed above to order for the table.  Share with each other, have a bite of everything--it's worth it--it's DELICIOUS!!!  The Pork Belly Pastrami is incredible--the flavors are amazing and you don't feel too guilty eating a big piece of fat as it's disguised with the condiments and pastrami flavors.  The Bacon Fat Popcorn--as one of the ladies I was with said, \"An orgasm in her mouth!!!\"  I kid you not.  We ordered extra bowls after plowing through the first couple.  Citizen Public House does an amazing job with this popcorn--fresh, filled with flavor, and just the right amount of delicious bacon bits on top.    The Chopped Salad--not exactly worth the rave reviews listed on Yelp and FB, BUT...it was very good, and a solid option.  Certainly made us feel better to have something \"healthier\" while indulging in heavier gastro-pub food.    Chicken & Waffles--TWO THUMBS UP!!!!  Much more \"savory\" chicken versus the chicken at Culinary Dropout.  Delicious, delicious, delicious!!!  Only complaint--needs TWO waffles instead of just one.  Ratio of chicken to waffle is not equal!  Burrata--DELICIOUS!  Generous serving of burrata.  Can't go wrong here, just had carb overload and probably could only stomach the cheese at this point.  Grilled Halloumi Cheese--one of the best grilled cheeses you'll have ever tasted!!!  A LOT of bread, though...better to share the plate with the table, or you won't have any room for dessert.  Everything Bread Pudding--To Die for!!!  A little dessert bowl of heaven, something in there for everyone to enjoy!  Cocktails--great!  The Persian was an interesting color and flavor, a bit sweet for my liking, but still enjoyable in the warm Scottsdale weather.  Folks, you'll enjoy this place!  There is something for EVERYONE to enjoy, and the meal will leave you raving for weeks on end afterwards.",

    "text": "Abridged: Chopped Salad. Superb drinks. Sparse decor.  Unabridged: I was excited for the chance to finally hit Citizen Public House. I know I know. But if you want to up my chances of going anywhere in Scottsdale, make them available during lunch hours.   At first glance I was only somewhat impressed. The decor and feel was very empty and sparse. Almost as if it had no vibe, but I'd heard great things about the food and beverage selection, and the hostess gave me props on my Pliny the Elder shirt (hopefully she wasn't making fun of me), so I was anxious to see what else was in store.  It was a Saturday night around 7, and apparently the place was booked until 9, though it looked really empty, and we were promised it would liven up soon as we sat at the bar.  The bacon fat popcorn quickly started to make up for the concerns I had. The whiskey concoction I had started to as well, until I realized they did have 12 and 18 year Jameson reserve but told me they didn't when I asked if my drink could be made with that.  The recommendation to have the Chopped Salad pretty much was the most amazing thing ever. It changed my life. It is my quest now to recreate this masterpiece in my home. I cried when I finished. I didn't want it to end, and I typically don't even like arugula!!  So the day wasn't a bust and I definitely will head back again. The company I surround myself with makes up for sparse decor and now I know better than to believe they don't have Jameson reserve.  Maybe it was my fault for dressing in bright colors and my weird style. I was also the only redhead :)",

The pita and hummus app. is a good starter too. Jenna is right the pork belly pastrami is a definite crowd pleaser.

My husband had the Amaro Meatloaf, and before he tasted it he was questioning if $20 was to much to spend on meatloaf; but after he ate it he said that it was worth every penny, and he even loved the roasted zucchini side. I had the Porcini Filet Mignon, which was one of the best steaks I've ever had. We then split the PB&B pudding jar, which was also fantastic.  We also had a few of their drinks, and I really appreciated the fact that their drink menu is full of unique drinks you don't find at every other restaurant. My husband particularly loved The Im-Port.  The atmosphere was nice also. More dressy than your everyday dining but also not overly snooty. Like I said, all in all this was a great dining experience and I'm sure we will go back. :)",

Bread pudding wasn't that great and I was pretty disappointed - though the waiter did suggest not getting it, I should have listened because he made great drink and entree suggestions.  I would absolutely come back and you should try it if you haven't.",

    "text": "Below is an e-mail that I wrote to the establishment a few months ago on behalf of my experience. I thought I would share it on Yelp, so I copied and pasted...  I first want to apologize for taking so long to write to you to tell you about my experience. I was there for my birthday dinner on May 10th, 2014. My boyfriend had called to make reservations and get everything squared away without my knowledge. He couldn't keep it a secret anymore, and about an hour before the reservation, he spilled the beans and told me that we would be going to Citizen Public House for dinner. Right away, I remembered that this nice guy named Sam, who we had met through the gym, said he had worked there. I don't know Sam very well on a personal level, but we do say hello in passing at the gym. I suggested he call to see if Sam was working so we could sit in his section. Sure enough, our request was accommodated and we were seated in his section. He recognized us right away and was pleasantly surprised that we were there.   Sam had asked us if we had dined there before, which we had not. I immediately made a comment about how everything on the menu looked good. Since he somewhat knew us, he asked if it would be ok for him to remove our menus from the table and allow him to surprise us throughout the night. I was stunned, and accepted his offer without any hesitation, giving him our full trust. He knows that I like eat healthier, so he informed me that he would be making some adjustments to the foods he would be choosing. Regardless of healthy eating, we splurged a bit, and Sam bought us tasters of some wine so we could choose a bottle. I enjoyed the options so much that I could not choose! ... but I did :) and it was wonderful!  The first thing Sam brought out was your famous Chopped Salad. I have no words to describe this, other than the fact that I could probably eat this salad every day for the rest of my life. This was the one thing I was told about Citizen Public House, and was told that if I went, I had to try it! He brought it for us to split as an appetizer and I was happy with his selection, as we had wanted it right from the beginning. For the entrees, Sam brought us modified versions of the Buttermilk Chicken and the Amaro Meatloaf and described them fully upon arrival. We definitely would not have gotten the meatloaf off of the menu if we had chosen, but both were so amazing!! I couldn't tell you what he did to modify them specifically, but they were made to cater our health requests just a tad. Un...bel...ieve...able. To top off the night, Sam asked if our special food needs could be catered by a nice desert, because he said he wanted to celebrate my birthday with us. We hesitated, but then decided that we can't say no and would make an exception this one night! I am so happy that he asked before, rather than surprising us with dessert (yes, I know it usually goes the other way around), but it showed he cared about our requests. I don't think this dessert was on the menu, but it came in a jar and I think it had some peanut butter something in it... amazing, candle lit and all.   Overall, my experience was beyond amazing. Not only was the food, drink, music, and ambience great, but Sam was exceptional. I don't think he took care of us just because he knew who we were... I truly believe that that is genuinely how he is as a person and a server! His knowledge is incredible, he is calm and confident in his performance, and he is willing to take a step above to make his guests happy. The funny part about this, is that I am also a server/bartender at a mid-high scale restaurant... and I can honestly say that Sam blew me away. I don't think any of our servers are up to his level, not even myself. You have a great employee on your hands and you should be proud to call him one of your staff members. I have been in the industry for 10 years now and I have never gone out of my way to write about how amazing someone is, but Sam is really that great!! We will definitely be back, and Sam is no longer just a guy I know at the gym, but he was one of the reasons why I had such a fantastic birthday this year and I will never forget the role he played that night.  Thank you so much for the amazing experience!!! I refuse to keep my mouth shut about your amazing restaurant and Sam's service!!!",

My chicken came with some perfectly prepared Brussel sprouts. Of particular note, however, is the chopped salad. This is unlike other chopped salads that you have ever had. It apparently has its own Facebook page. All that I know is that it is really, really good  CPH is in a great location. Our server was very knowledgable and engaging. The atmosphere is an attractive mix of hip and old school. I would definitely recommend Citizen Public House to anyone who finds themselves in Scottsdale",

The restaurant was packed and the bar was full nearly the entire time we were there.  We enjoyed the winter menu...the hubs ordered the meatloaf and it was magical...I don't even LIKE meatloaf and I asked for multiple bites. So what did I order? The field salad small plate and acorn squash with goat cheese and chorizo. Don't get me wrong the entrees all looked delicious but I couldn't get past the 'small plate' menu. Two items were perfect for me.  The flavors of all of the dishes were perfect and extremely complementary of each other. I don't believe there would be a bad choice on the menu and can't wait to go a second time.  So, not only are we foodies, we love good craft cocktails and here, again CPH delivered.   When you are looking to indulge and want something outside if the box...you won't be disappointed with Citizen Public House.  Cheers!!",

I had a couple of cocktails (the grog and something barrel-aged; forgot the name), both of which were better than I expected.  For dinner, had a few apps--the fondue, the mac and cheese, and the chia tuna. I don't think you can really go wrong with fondue, so that was fine; the chia tuna was decent and I liked the rice it's plated on. The mac and cheese though--WHY would you put tomatoes in mac and cheese?! You're desecrating the dish! It does NOT work. When I ate around the tomatoes, the mac and cheese was great! I don't get it.  Otherwise, I think the restaurant was worthwhile, and I'm glad we stopped by.",

I have been told by a close source, Mandi B., that the Handcrafted Sangria is delicious.  The Hummus & Tzatziki is the best I have ever tasted.  Everything tastes so fresh and good.  The Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn is a fantastic starter.  I have only been here for drinks and light bites.  The Chopped Salad was the best salad I've ever tasted and I hate salads.

When I fist walked in, I was greeted immediately and Matt (with the pretty blue eyes) escorted us to a nice booth for just the two of us and wished me a happy birthday (we were there to celebrate my birthday).   We ordered the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn to start. It was freshly popped popcorn with actual bacon pieces on top. Yum. Then we shared the Original Chopped Salad. I crave these things so it was all that I'd dreamed of. My hubby ordered the lam burger for dinner (he said it was really good, but wished he had ordered it well instead of medium well) and I got the Truffled Grilled Cheese Sandwich, which had mashed potato on it (holla!) you could also add chicken or bacon, but I opted for it just the way it was. It was so good!  For cocktails, my hubby had the Beast (tequila cocktail - strong, but with a kick) and I had the Manhattan (strong, but tasty) and the Julep (strong, but sweeter than the Manhattan). They definitely don't skimp on the alcohol and know how to make a good cocktail.   Our server brought out the dessert menu and suggested the bread pudding or the peanut butter bar. We decided to go with the peanut butter bar (chocolate, peanut butter, strawberry jam, white chocolate ice cream). When it came out with no candle, the hubs asked where it was. The server hadn't been told it was my birthday! Pretty blue-eyed Matt had dropped the ball! (Bad Matt, bad). She felt really bad and brought out a candle, which was really very sweet. We then received a visit from the General Manager, Steve. He also felt really bad because they feel a birthday is special and if one chooses to spend it there, then it is a big deal to them. Because of all that, they comped the dessert (birthday dessert is apparently super tiny) and our popcorn AND gave us a $50 gift card to come back and let them make it up to us!   I think they went above and beyond the realm of good customer service and am looking forward to going back. I can't believe it took me so long to go in the first place!  to you, CPH.",

    "text": "Have you ever heard of a salad that is so popular that it has its own Facebook page? I know I couldn't believe it either, but this isn't any ordinary salad. Think tidy rows of smoked salmon, Israeli couscous, asiago cheese, arugula, sweet dried corn, black currants and pepitas (toasted pumpkin seeds) topped with a creamy pesto dressing all tossed table-side. The Stetson Chopped Salad should not only have its own fan page but its creator, Chef Bernie Kantak, should be given a hug every time you see him at his new Citizen Public House.   Located in what used to be the valleys original Trader Vic's, there isn't a tiki torch in sight. Instead you'll find a contemporary space outfitted with wood accents, leather booths and a stainless steel-topped bar. The vibe is casual and relaxed elevated by outstanding service on every one of my visits.   If you're wondering what a public house is, well simply put it's a tavern that also serves food. While they do serve some great drinks and have an excellent wine list, I'd be hard pressed to call Citizen a mere tavern. How many taverns have you ever heard of serving pork studded Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn ($5)? Or how about a pot filled with creamy 'Kilt Lifter' Fondue ($9) savory hunter's sausage, sweet tangy pears and toasted country bread? If you have, please let me know right away.  For dinner I couldn't recommend The Original Chopped Salad ($12) more but if you don't like smoked salmon, they can make it with chicken instead. The Mirliton Chopped Salad ($12), a composition including chayote, snow pea greens, tomatoes, popcorn, grilled halloumi cheese; cucumber-onion salad tossed with a tangy parsley-garlic dressing was a fantastic textural explosion but lives in the shadow of its older sibling.  I'm not even sure where to start with the entrees; I guess it comes down to price point. Take the lower priced lusciously juicy Lamb Burger ($12) topped with a cucumber salad, zesty tzatziki and served with fries, you'd think with flavor and quality like this would be much more expensive.   At the other end of the price range sit the fantastically meaty Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs ($28) complete with a side of brightly sour dried cherry bbq sauce and roasted parsnip puree. Somewhere in between is the juicy \"Smart\" Chicken ($18) which refers to the brand not the chicken's admission into the Mensa Society.   Desserts by Tracy Dempsey were all that and a bag of cookies, literally. Cookies and Milk ($6) were delightfully chewy and come served in a sealed pouch for freshness, of course the milk was ice cold just perfect for dunking. Three words, Strawberry Pound Cake ($9). A thick slice of strawberry olive oil pound cake is lightly grilled then served with vanilla malted ice cream, chocolate sauce and malted strawberry streusel and like the Stetson salad it was Facebook worthy.",

Now is that salad good for you?  Not at all.  Hence, the over the top reviews.   Any time I\"ve been there I\"ve had a great experience. Whether at the bar or at a table, this is a nice place with great food and drinks.    Happy hour from 3-6!  Score!",

    "text": "We came here on the Saturday before Valentine's day and definitely treated ourselves. The menu is definitely on the higher price end, but it is so worth it. It was happy hour when we arrived, and ordering appetizers off the bar food menu was awesome. We had the rosemary roasted nuts and the hummus and pita. Both were awesome, and very cheap because of the happy hour.  My wife ordered the duck burger, which had probably the best fries I have ever had. It makes me want to eat duck fat fries every night with my dinner! I had the short ribs, which were great as well. The cherry sauce was a little too sweet for me, but the rest was perfect.  I have a dairy allergy, which can make eating out difficult, or limit what I can eat at time, but our waiter was super helpful and understanding, and worked with the kitchen to ensure I had a full, amazing meal, which was very appreciated.  The one downside was the noise level. We originally got to the restaurant early enough so it wasn't an issue, but around the time we left it was quite loud and had to talk loudly to hear each other.",

    "text": "*This review is on behalf of a party of 12!* After some bridal dress shopping some lovely ladies, two children, and I came in about 8 on Saturday night. The bride-to-be absolutely adores The Gladly, so of course we had to come here while in the area. They were expecting our party, and even though we were 15 minutes early, we waited no more than 5 minutes to be seated. We were sat at a big table, semiprivate spot.   For starters we tried the Noble Bread, Mac 'n Cheese, and one ordered the Kilt Lifter Fondue. Everyone loved the bread especially the tomatoes and yummy butter that came with it. The fondue was also far from a disappointment. But the real killer from the starters was the Mac 'n cheese. It had raving reviews from both adults and kids!  Some main courses that were ordered included: Meatloaf, Chopped Salad, Scallops, Filet Mignon, and Rib Tacos. I'm not joking when I say every single person LOVED their dish! I was the one who forked out for the Filet but I really do not regret it! Hands down the most melt-in-my-mouth piece of meat I've EVER had. Also, I'm all about sauces with my steak (not that it necessarily needed it), so (per my request) they gave me the closest thing to a sauce they had. I thought that was awesome and it really made it for me!  I didn't drink, but the cocktails also were loved by everyone who ordered one. For dessert some had the Sorbet and Peach Blackberry Galette. I only tried the Galette and it was REALLY amazing. Definitely enough to share too! And to top off this perfect experience, it was also so cool that they sold the Homeboys hot sauce. The soon-to-be-bride had to take two bottles home!   As for the service -- superb. A lovely young blonde woman was our server. She stayed on top of everything and accommodated us with separate checks. I'd recommend CPH to anyone after this visit. They were AMAZING to us and were def the right choice for our dinner party! We all left In Good Spirits ;)",

We went to Citizen last night. The highlight of the dinner was the chop salad- it is INCREDIBLE! The smoked salmon was delicious- soft, juicy, and so flavorful. The herb dressing- amaze! The most pleasant surprise was their signature roasted mix of pumpkin seeds, berries, etc. The salad is so good that we are going to go to the airport early just to get another :-)  I had the \"Caesar\" - a deconstructed Caesar salad. The meat was so moist and very flavorful. Brad explained this was because it was not brined, but soaked in a buttermilk mixture. Regardless, it was yummy. I was lost by the rest of the dish, though. The chicken sat on some Caesar dressing. With the amazing flavor of the chicken, I was confused why they chose to put it over dressing, leaving a grilled wedge of lettuce naked on the other side of the plate. There were two dollops of pureed vegetables. Very bland and cold- yuck.  My fiance had the scallops. He said they were amazing and I kept eating the grits off of his plate- cheesey with some balsamic. Soooooo yummy!  Our friend had the short ribs- he said they were overcooked. Our other friend had the tacos and did not comment on them.  The service, the scallops, and the salad knocked this place out of the park! Unfortunately the others were just a little blah.",

My friend and I did some splitting of dishes and that was just great.   Started off with a sangria, which I would highly recommend, it was very flavorful and not your typical approach. For an appetizer, we went for the fondu, served with a Swiss type cheese along with pear, sausage and homemade bread. For the main course, we tried the fried chicken with brussel sprouts. The entree was served perfectly and they split it for us on two plates :)   Our server was very friendly and helpful. She kept trying to keep our fondue warm and lit outside, but the wind kept blowing the flame out! I will absolutely come back to try different items on the menu :)",

The Original Chopped Salad was absolutely to die for and even has it's own Facebook page! I'm not normally a huge fan of salads, but you have to order this if you come here. The ingredients include corn, arugula, couscous, tomatoes, garlic, basil, etc. Every bite is super flavorful and has a lot of texture. Everyone at the table ordered the same salad, and loved it.   For my cocktail, I enjoyed the Second Generation, which consisted of Absolut Pear, chareau aloe liquer, aperol, lemon, simple syrup, and cucumber and mint. This was light, refreshing, and delicious. Hats off to the bartender!  I loved this restaurant, and can't wait to come back to try out the other menu items.",

The chopped salad is everything they hype it up to be. AMAZING. Best salad I've ever had and I anticipate ordering it for lunch a few days a week. The Mac and cheese was ok - but the waitress never really recommended it anyway. Between our table we got the rack of lamb, short rib entree, and meatloaf... The short ribs were BY FAR the best thing by a mile. The meatloaf was good - very well prepared and the rack of lambs were simply standard... I wouldn't get them again but I would try the scallops next time. The desert is the best thing in Scottsdale - heart of caramel! Trust me on that one!!!  Service was wonderful but you can tell they are busy. I'm giving it a four star because the rack of lamb for 38.00 was very average and I was walking away pretty disappointed with that meal.",

    "text": "The tomfoolery has to stop.     Citizen Public House is just a bar in the guise of a restaurant.. And because it's Scottsdale, everything has a price tag  that hovers 30% above where it should be. Does anyone but me notice this problem?  If nothing else, the noise level at CPH is unacceptable. The reverberation of the diner's voices in the space is deafening. I was there on a Saturday night and I had to raise my voice just to have a conversation with one of my dining companions sitting right next to me.  The acoustics of the building are particularly bad and no one, especially the owner has done a thing to absorb the sounds by softening the surfaces. Does he even notice? My drink was tasty (The end of the world)  but not really worth $12 for five tablespoons of liquid. I get it though. Mixed drinks = high profit margin.  Our chopped salad was a tasty combo of ingredients. I did enjoy this salad.  I wasn't super hungry so instead of ordering another starter (our waiter said the tuna crudo was very small) I got the hippie dippie sandwich. What a disaster. The greasiest fries ever. The chunks of eggplant were only partially cooked. Too much mayonnaise - and why mayonnaise? In 'n out burger does better grilled onions and fries than CPH.  Such an unpleasant sandwich. Had it not been so busy, I might  have marched into the kitchen and demanded that the chef explain how this is acceptable, quality food in an expensive restaurant.    The young waiter was obviously overwhelmed and far too obsequious. The other diners had scallops which looked tasty but I couldn't hear their opinions due to the din in the dining space. $30 for three scallops? Some bars parading as restaurants will hopefully have enough reviews like this for them to sit up and take notice. A bigger menu is not better. I won't ever eat here again. But honestly the responsibility was mine to send back food that is poorly made. We as diners must demand more from restaurants.",

Our group of 10 included a 9 year old who was head over heels for the \"really fun\" fondue - it kept her busy while the adults could enjoy a glass of wine and their meals. Don't hesitate to take a well behaved older child, but not a place for toddlers.",

    "text": "Went in for a friends birthday last night. The food, drinks, and our server were amazing and if it were not for the unfortunate experience with the management staff, I would have highly suggested this place to anyone. Because we had a larger party, they had explained while making the reservation that they could only do one check, but would take multiple forms of payment. When the check arrived, we went through, and wrote down what items went on which card, so the server would easily be able run each card for whatever the total would have been. A few minutes later the manager comes back, sets the cards back on the table with a calculator and says that they were not going to do the math for us, and to figure it out ourselves. After we did, I approached the managers again to explain how unprofessional and rude that was, given they have computers that could have easily done the math for them had they not chosen to be lazy. They went on to tell me that they were \"very clear\" when we made the reservation that they were not going to split the check...which was not what we were asking them to do when asking them to do some basic math. They went on to tell me how \"lucky\" we were that they even got our size group in on such short notice. (*Bear in mind we had 12 people at 10pm...there was so much room in the restaurant we could have been a walk-in party and they would have easily been able to get us right in, even without a reservation.) I have worked in the restaurant industry for the last 5 years, and when I explained that in my experience I had never worked at or been to a restaurant that would ever toss a calculator on a table and tell the guests to \"figure it out themselves,\" the woman said she \"encouraged me to eat at those other restaurants then.\" Im giving it 2 stars because the food and drinks were good, but dont waste your time at this place if you dont want to deal with lazy, rude management.",

    "text": "I was in town for the Culinary Arts Festival and got a recommendation for this place for Friday night. The place looked cool and the server was very friendly. I started with the sangria and it was a good place to start. Between the three of us, we started with the flatbread, the original chopped, and the korean pear salad. All three were tasty and delicious. I loved the flavors of my salad the best, but the chopped had a lot of taste going on and the hummus was smooth and subtle (ie-not too heavy on the garlic). Great start to the meal indeed. For dinner, I ordered the halibut and my dinner partners-in-crime ordered the pork tenderloin and the short-ribs. Bites of all three confirmed tastiness once again. To round things out, dessert menus arrived.  We ordered the strawberry poundcake, the bread pudding, and the cookies and milk. And here is where they lost that fifth star. The cookies were terrible. Three of the four were hard as rocks. The spicy chocolate was the only one with flavor that was recognizable. The other three were kitchen experiments gone awry--and not awry in that \"this is experimental and new so it must be good\" kind of way. Awry in that spit this out and we know why they serve it with milk kind of way. If you are going to have an awesome restaurant and you want to be clever by offering cookies and milk, bake some good cookies. Or buy good cookies. If they can make bread pudding, they can make cookies (or take them completely off the menu).",

The area was small, but pleasant and the staff was very accommodating.  After our party arrived, we went inside for our meal.  The dining room has great atmosphere.  It was casual, but you still felt like you were at a nice restaurant/bar.  The pork belly pastrami was awesome even though my friends complained the appetizer dish was too small.  I mean, how much pork belly can one really eat?  For entree, I got the pan seared scallops which were great.  The portion was a bit small, with just 3 scallops.  I did not mind it as I was not very hungry, but others may have a problem with that.  For drinks, I had sangria, which was tasty.  My friends got the Citi-Zen which they enjoyed.  They guys were not too thrilled about The Persian cocktail because they claim there was not enough alcohol.  Overall, 5 stars because I had a really good time and all the food that I tried were good.  -1 star for being a bit too pricey for what they have to offer and also some others in my party were not completely thrilled with their food/drink choices.",

The service was excellent, food even better, and we left a very very very happy couple.    (Unfortunately we had almost the exact opposite experience at our next stop- the Side Bar).    Highly recommend the Public House.  Classy, yet casual.  Anything seems to go here.  Sequins and Sweatshirts.  I woke up this morning, yes, wanting my scallops entree AGAIN.  For breakfast. That is kind of gross, but you get the picture.",

The decor is nice, but you can definitely tell it used to be an art gallery with the way the walls are set. CPH made good use of the space however, and lighting as well, with lots of clean lines and dark woods.   Our server, was absolutely fantastic. He came with good suggestions for wine pairings, knowledge about the menu, and timed our food to an absolute T. I ordered the chopped salad, which was to die for. I've never had smoked salmon in my chopped salad before, but the array of flavors and colors was just beautiful in this dish. Looking at the menu there literally isnt a dish on the menu I wouldnt try. I cant wait to go back and dig in again.   The sole snafu of the night was with our bill, they accidentally charged my friend 3x for the total bill, which was expensive for 6 of us. Rich (one of the managers) was quick to try and fix it, but come tuesday morning it still wasnt fixed from friday. My friend went back in on Wednesday to try and have it fixed, wherein another one of the managers was present and apparently took a lot of attitude with my friend. Despite the snafu with the bill, we will still come back.",

At a glance, the menu seems a bit ho-hum considering the price, but that notion vanished as soon as our waiter, Tomas, started explaining the items to us.  Though very down-to-earth, he had a story-teller's gift for describing the food in a manner that brought out its complexity and our lust.  The chef demonstrated the same talent in execution.    The Korean pear salad is good, but you get to watch the preparation of the original chopped salad -- no ordinary thing.  The pork belly pastrami is rich beyond imagination.  Even the mac and cheese is yummy.  The pan-seared scallops sitting on a bed of grits may be the best dish there, but the smart chicken and short ribs are also hard to ignore.    The dessert menu almost tricked me also.  At first glance, nothing for chocolate lovers, but the Pot de Creme has a serious surprise on the bottom.  I'd also go back for the bread pudding.  The location and layout are convenient though not particularly memorable.  Though the patio is small the restaurant proper opens into it with some large doors to provide an outdoor feel.",

    "text": "Monday night.  teenager is out of town on trip.  what to do?  head to Citizen Public House to try some of the dishes we've heard about.  first thing -- though the address may \"be\" on 5th Ave., it faces Craftsman Court.  Understand if the PO won't let you change your address, but might be wise to make a mention of it on your website.  we drove up and down 5th twice looking for 7111.    we were one of three tables occupied at 6 p.m.  We chose indoors next to the open doors to the patio.  Wanted the ambiance of the indoors, not the so-so view of the street from the patio.  unfortunately the air conditioning was cranked full blast.  when made mention to server, all we got was \"wow, really, we're really warm.\"  we ordered cocktails, and had to catch our waitresses eye after she  and other staffers spent some time talking to a regular that had come in.  where's our drink?  oh, the bar didn't see the ticket -- and was busy talking to the regular.  shouldn't take 10 minutes to get a drink when you're two of 10 people in the restaurant.   ordered the fondue -- used Kilt Lifter.  Cheese sauce was quite good -- not overpowering.  asian pear for dipping a nice touch, as well as the homemade hunter sausage.  the bread was fine.  one problem?  the sterno blew out as soon as the waitress left (told you there was a draft from the a/c) and she was not seen anywhere.  so...we ate fast.  crispy squid were just okay.  the highlight of the night?  the pork belly pastrami with rye spaetzel (typically little blobs of dough dropped into boiling water...these were bigger, cylindrical shaped), and an outstanding brussels sprouts sauerkraut.  could eat three more plates of this in one sitting it was so good.  (actually, was dreaming about the spaetzel on the way over, but due to its shape and denseness, it took a backseat to the brussels....).  we split the grilled halloumi cheese sandwich.  good....would order it for a lunch, but nothing outstanding.  what stole the show?  the apple/bacon bread pudding with bourbon brown sugar sauce.  we ditched the cinnamon ice cream on top and just focused on the sweet, smoky, crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside pudding with its not too cloying sauce.  overall...good place for a good drink and some eats.  destination restaurant for best food in town?  no.  service is casual.  not bad, just casual.  if you've got nowhere to go, you'll be okay with it.  meanwhile, i'm trying to figure out how to get more of that pork belly pastrami and brussels.....",

Don't get me wrong, the food and service is wonderful, but overall the restaurant is lacking just a tiny bit in the \"awesome vibe\" factor (if that makes sense). Great for a date night. My husband and I typically turn to Citizen Public House for drinks at the bar - either before dinner or for a nightcap before heading home.   The big, dark wood bar is stationed in the main attraction of the restaurant and feels very hip and mysterious all at the same time. Unlike so many bars (especially in Scottsdale), Citizen Public House prides itself on actual bar mixologists. I've seen some of the most elaborate cocktails being poured and served at this bar - it's so fun to watch and learn. The bartenders are wonderful, knowledgeable and nice to boot. You can't go wrong!",

If you're expecting a True \"Public House\" with local or interesting beers, this restaurant has no different beers than dozens of other places. So go someplace cheaper.  On the food front, everything was \"meh\", suffering from the symptom of having too much going on.  The famous chopped salad was smoked salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, dried corn, tomatoes, and I can't remember what else.  It tasted like it sounds: a bunch of divergent stuff thrown together on a plate because those ingredients should be interesting together. But they're not.  I also had the roast pork sandwich.  I can't quite tell you what it tasted like.  But, the menu said it was \"fennel roasted pork sirloin, rapini, Scamorza cheese, Serbian lepinja roll, pickled vegetables.\" I don't even know what half of those things are, so it must be interesting, right? Meh, not so much.  But, everyone else seems to like it, including the Arizona Republic, so what do I know?",

I have eaten here numerous times and the service is always up to par. Knowledgable staff who isn't afraid to suggest dishes or drinks and will be attentive through the duration of your meal.   The drinks are some of the best in the valley. If you are being really adventurous try the speakeasy style bar upstairs where thy will turn vodka into gin table side. It's a pretty great experience.   Finally and most importantly, the food is outstanding. You have to try the pork pastrami which is a deconstructed version of the sandwich with succulent pork belly, sauerkraut and spaetzle. The truffled grilled cheese is amazing layered with gooey cheese and potatoes. Do yourself a favor and add bacon which really takes this sandwich to the next level adding texture and some needed salt. Keeping on the pork them their short ribs are also outstanding.   All the deserts are made by Tracey Dempsey and are delicious. You really can't go wrong with anyone of them, but if your full take a bag of the bacon pecan brittle home. You won't regret it.",

Nice atmosphere... a little bit on the dark side though... we sat at a high top near the bar and my friend had to use her phone to read the menu.... so I'd consider that slightly too dark to be comfortable.   On to the food- Bacon Popcorn, yes, absolutely, yes.  If I do return it will be solely for the bacon popcorn and drinks.   Short rib- don't do it. Whenever I see short ribs, I have to get them. This just did not meet expectations. The greens were gritty and the parsnips were much too sweet. All I ate on the plate was the meat, and for 25 (or 28?) dollars, I think the accompaniments should be good also. Meatloaf (friend had it)- excellent! Great meatloaf, mashed potatoes were yummy, and roasted zucchini was very good.    The dessert was not memorable- I remember we didn't finish it, but thats all I can remember (and it's only been 5 days!)   At the end of the day, there are better places in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "Perhaps we just went on a bad night? Ordered the wrong things off of the Late Night menu?  I was SO excited to check this place out, especially after reading the many great reviews on the food and service here. I'm sad to report that our experience lacked the luster that I was so looking forward to. :(  Off of the Late Night menu we ordered the ribs, wings, and hummus & tzatziki. The ribs had nice texture, but there was no flavor to it at all! Same with the wings. It literally tasted like the wings had been sitting on the counter the whole day, and someone just threw a bunch of extra sauce on top of the wings before serving it to us. Not pleasant to eat at all.  The hummus & tzatziki, though? Very good.   What really disappointed me about this meal is that it seemed as though our server KNEW that the food was going to turn out pretty badly. He asked us if the food we ordered was enough for us, but never asked if we were enjoying the meal. When I proceeded to let him know that I thought the food was \"okay\" his response was...and I quote...\"yeah, but is it ENOUGH?\" I didn't think it was a very polite or appropriate response.  It also didn't help that he got our order wrong...twice. He even asked us to repeat our order three times, and he still brought out the wrong dish. Maybe he was trying to discreetly tell us that we didn't choose good dishes?  Regardless, I'm not going to go out of my way to try this place again. Perhaps if I'm in the area, I'll give the real menu (and not the Late Night menu) a go, but at this point, I'm not entirely sure it would be worth it.  If you do decide to try this place, hope your experience is better than mine!",

It just so happened that the night we stopped by was the last night of their restaurant week, so we were able to try a few things off the menu.   The ingredients of the chopped salad at first glance seemed like a strange assortment but wow did they come together nicely. It had a unique and memorable flavor, the smoked salmon tasted very fresh.  I am not usually a fan of meatloaf but the waiter made it sounds so good I had to try it. He wasn't wrong. It was moist, and perfectly seasoned, and also - a very filling portion, enough to share.   And the desserts..  Were a perfect ending. We tried both the peanut butter jelly type concoction and the peanut butter chocolate dish. They were both really tasty. Not too sweet or overpowering, really pleasant to eat.  Finally, the citi-zen cocktail is delicious. A little fruity, sour, and sweet complete with yummy rock candy.   We left satisfied but not overly stuffed.

We started with some drinks (I had the very ginger/spicy Moe'scow Mule, and loved it) and shared two appetizers between the three of us: the Original Chopped Salad (smoked salmon, \"trail mix\", greens, freeze-dried sweet corn ... So good) and an off menu twist of the on-menu Bernie's Mac and Cheese: we had the three cheese blend, but served as a Fondue with bread, pears and a spicy meat (maybe a pastrami?) for dipping -- also amazing.    My father had short ribs, my mother had scallops, and I had duck (land, sea and air!) and all three were phenomenal.  The Smoked Duck Breast I had was cooked perfectly and will be the duck By which I measure all future duck meals.    My mother's scallops were so sweet and so tender (per our server, Chris, sushi grade) and the dried cherry barbecue sauce served with the short ribs was so uniquely sweet and spicy I left thinking of other meats it would taste good on!  We'd originally planned on going elsewhere for desert afterwards but figured that as everything else was so good, a great desert was a likely possibility.  They did not disappoint. We finished the evening with the Choco-Chili Bread Pudding.  Not too sweet, just the right amount of spicy, and topped with a scoop of delicious tortilla ice cream.   We left grinning ear to ear, so satisfied and recounting how tasty everything was for a good 45 minutes after the meal.  Do not pass this place by!",

    "text": "I came to Scottsdale as part of a 15-gent bachelor party, and CPH was our big night/sendoff dinner for the bachelor.  As a result, we did a $50-per-person fixed price menu that featured a choice of one of two salads, one of four entrees, and a chef's selection on dessert.  As my friends will tell you, I eat out 6-8 times per week all over America and at nicer restaurants a couple of times a month...I've never seen one of these menus get you less food than I got last night.  (This had that \"Restaurant Week for dinner in DC\" feel to it; DC folks know what I'm talking about!)  Part of that was tied to dessert.  I'm allergic to nuts.  Bottom line, the chef's selection featured three desserts that all featured some form of nuts.  (I don't think a nut allergy is particularly rare these days...do you?)  I asked our server--who was otherwise an excellent host for our large, somewhat unruly group--if I could just get something plain, a chocolate cake, or a cheesecake, or sorbet...anything.  The answer was a flat no.  That affected the rest of my thoughts on the meal, really.  I'm normally a cocktail guy but I opted for a glass of the pinot grigio, which was fine...but from reading some of these Yelp reviews, it looks like I should have gotten a cocktail.  The salad (field greens) was fine, a little overdressed but the greens were tasty.  The entree was, frankly, an injustice...for a fixed price menu that also featured a 7-to-8 oz. steak and the biggest piece of chicken I've seen not on top of a waffle in Chicago, the scallops were puny.  I mean, beyond puny.  THREE SCALLOPS?  I literally took a small bite a minute, just to stretch out the amount of food on the plate.  The greens served with it were chewy, almost tough to cut with a normal knife.  So, to summarize, $50 got me three scallops, about one measuring cup worth of salad greens, and no dessert.  I can't in good conscience recommend coming back, but again, I thought the service was great and the space was well lit and featured good-looking people (I am finding this is standard in Scottsdale, but still).  I did go out to eat later that evening, because I was so freakin' starved.  At least our bachelor left happy!",

The pork belly was amazing.  I can't wait to go back and have it again. We shared the short rib.  It was a pretty healthy portion.  My husband and I were able to share one.  The bbq sauce was a tad bit on the bitter side.  I think I will try the scallops next time.  The cocktails were amazing.  I'm really into cucumber right now, so the Persian was to die for.  Service was great!  Our food came out quickly.",

The entrance is on Craftsman Court, but otherwise easy to find. We decided to eat outside where they had 5 tables on the patio.  We really enjoyed our meal which included hush puppies with jalapeno hot sauce and olives early on, then the Duck burger egg and bacon, which was delicious.  Really pleased with the experience.",

    "text": "This was one of those places that was fascinating to experience, and you don't know if you should document the evening chronologically, or by vice to virtue (or vice versa).  I love that my girl servin' us encouraged me to try somethin' new-- the Import. Ultimately, it didn't work out, and she struck it from the check (despite my protests) and stood behind the joint's penchant for gettin' fools open on food. Integrity = respect.  It was actually a rad conversation, because at first I couldn't come down on how I felt about this Jameson, tobacco bitters, tawny port & Guinness foam concoction, but I landed on \"It tastes like a flat Old Fashioned,\" and gettin' there was a few interactions between she-beaux and I and my girl servin' it up. That meant no pretense, no chit-chat, just real-talk about food and experience.  Ironically, my love had a drink called the Pleasantville that she described as \"boring.\"  While the pork was dry on the outside, it was tasty and moist internally, and the polenta was a bit scarce, but equally tasty. She-beaux destroyed the scallops, and the tuna that set the meal off was way off the meat rack.  Finally, the atmosphere (or crowd): we could not tear our eyes away from the desert rose (the Sweet Dee kind) who was way out of this homeboy's league, him with his jeans and flip flops and checked shirt tucked in (no belt(!)) and cuffs rolled up just once--- just once, mind you! This little scene was par for the course.    But my man sealed the deal, much to our bewilderment, and I think the Citizen's contribution to this feat shouldn't be underestimated or understated.  What else could explain such a thing?  Loved this place. Absolutely loved it.",

Very solid wine list with mostly California wines but a few Europeans to fill some holes. Good cocktail list, too. Their signature chopped salad mixed tableside is delicious and filling, easily enough for two to share. I had the catfish starter which was surprisingly light -- very lightly coated and came with a pickle relish and a hot sauce that paired perfectly with the dish. I loved it. We both had the grilled chicken breast over truffled rice. This dish was okay -- the chicken was overcooked, a little too burnt and dry and I'm not sure the truffled rice worked but I liked the idea. Would def go back to try a few other items, though there are a surprising number of good bistro-style restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale. Service was very good/nice as well, from the hostess to the waitress.",

It's in the heart of old town, great location, big open windows with the bar in the middle, the ambience was great. Very noisy though, so don't think it's something intimate. You HAVE TO order the original chopped salad, the most amazing salad I've ever had. They put dried corn in the salad and it tastes like crouton but sweet, and the smoked salmon for protein, the flavors are amazing. The pork belly pastrami was good, but nothing special. It tastes just like any other pork belly dish but it was still cooked perfectly. The porcini fillet mignon was really delicious, the rub was very tasty and the steak was cooked perfectly to my liking. They have a great wine list and specialty cocktails. Great place to hang out with a small group and the people there are nice and knowledgeable. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "My husband Matt B. and I met our friend Stef P. for dinner one night in Scottsdale, at Citizen Public House. We'd just flown into town and were looking forward to an easy gastropub dinner. The place was not at all what we expected. It was less gastropub than full-on upscale sit-down restaurant, with entrees creeping into the $30 range. Thankfully, we ended up loving the place.  Citizen Public House is in cozy Old Town Scottsdale, and it was vibrant and charming on a Friday night. We had a late reservation (9:15) and the place was still pretty busy. I liked the atmosphere--it was nice, but informal. We hadn't seen Stef in four years, and had a great time catching up over dinner. Service was excellent. Our waiter Brad was on top of his game.  We had a couple rounds of drinks, and I really enjoyed the cocktails. The Im-Port was particularly good, a smokey drink made with Jameson, Tawny Port, tobacco bitters, and Guinness foam, served on the rocks with a smoked sugar rim. The Thai Margarita was pleasant, too, a mix of Patron silver with galangal and kaffir lime simple syrup, tamarind reduction, Thai chili sea salt, basil, and lime, served on the rocks. It tasted more like a straight margarita than I thought it would, but I liked it. I also had a sample of the barrel-aged Craftsman, made with Jameson, Cocchi Americano, and Charbay green tea apertif. (Brad brought it over because I was waffling between the Im-Port and the Craftsman, and he gave me a free taste after I'd already decided on the Im-Port.) It was pretty great, smooth and boozy with a definite sweetness. Probably would've gotten it if I wanted a third drink. Matt tried one of the other barrel-aged cocktails, the Boulvardier [sic?] made with Maker's 46 bourbon, Campari, and sweet vermouth. Another solid drink.  The food was fantastic. The three of us shared the pork belly pastrami and an order of Bernie's mac 'n cheese, which worked as both appetizer and side. The pork belly pastrami seems to be Citizen Public House's signature dish, and it's a great one. Pork belly came pastrami-cured and spiced, with rye spaetzle, brussels sprout sauerkraut, and mustard jus. The pork was juicy, fatty, and intensely flavorful, and I loved all of the sides. It wouldn't be right to come here without trying this dish. The mac 'n cheese was also delicious, made with curly cavatappi pasta in a gorgonzola and emmental cheese sauce, with a chilled tomato relish on top. The pasta was cooked al dente and I loved the sharp cheeses and the spicy tomato relish. The portion was huge. We split it three ways and still had leftovers.  I had the pan-seared scallops for my entree, while Matt and Stef had the fair trade short ribs. Both were excellent. The scallops were plump and beautifully cooked, served with Hampshire belly bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens, and a cola gastrique. There was so much great flavor and texture on this plate. It was exactly what I wanted. The short ribs were another winner, a giant plate of tender coffee-rubbed ribs with dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree, and seasonal vegetables.  We ended up spending more than we meant to at Citizen Public House, but we were on vacation and had a truly lovely meal. I'd recommend this place for a nice dinner out in Scottsdale, to locals and tourists alike.",

The cocktail my husband had was made with port wine, guiness foam, and bourbon. It was actually tasty and he really enjoyed it. I had a Manhattan and enjoyed it as well.

I got the Persian cocktail because I love all cucumber drinks. I remarked I hadn't had a cocktail that good since being in New York.  For my entree, I asked for a veggie plate mostly because I was too embarrassed to ask for what I really wanted-- a big plate of brussels sprouts. The waiter offered the risotto that comes with another dish as a veg entree so I went with that. The risotto itself was kind of bland, but the earthy mushrooms on top made up for that. My husband loved the scallops and said the grits they came with were the best he's ever had.  We went for the peanut butter dessert which was a decadent combo of chocolate ganache and pb mousse. There was way too much ganache for my taste. It was hard to dig into the dessert, but it still tasted good, especially with the tasty crumble on top.  Two things I loved about CPH: our enthusiastic server and the space. The server was great at the get go, but I wish I would have seen more of him throughout the meal. I am surprised to see people bashing the starkness of the interior. I think it looks sleek and modern but still warm and inviting.  We'll be back whenever we can't get into FnB.",

We decided to stop by here because of the high yelp reviews that we had to try it and be able to say \"we've been here and tried it.\"  Well, I'm glad we did!  Even though we sat at the bar, our service with our bartender was superb.  He was able to make some fancy mixology cocktail for my fiance and I.  He also sold us on their dessert menu.  We end up getting the souffle which our bartender recommended.  As always, souffle takes awhile to make but it was worth the wait.  It was made just right because watching Master Chef educated me how and what makes a souffle go wrong. It was nice and crisp on top and the inside wasn't too mushy.  When I'm back in town, I'll definitely try out their entree menu.",

We do tend to dine like early birds and came at 6pm which seems to be before the regular crowd.  The restaurant was about half full but there was not an available seat at the bar...drinks must be good.    When I come to places like this I tend to like when servers \"sell\" me on what I should have for dinner.  Sam did just that.  Not in a \"salesman\" type of way.  In the way that I believe that he knows the menu and asked enough about what we liked to offer suggestions.  I was being indecisive about cocktails and he said \"may I surprise you!?!?\"  UH YEAH!  I love surprises!  He brought back a martini glass with delicious and refreshing absinth, aloe, slightly sweet and other stuff.  Great surprise!    The Original Salad.  Amazing!  Alone, the ingredients sound a little ridiculous but together, it is amazing!  I would go back just for that salad.    Based on Sam's recommendations we went with the Pan Seared Scallops and the Fair Trade Short Ribs.  I live for this kind of stuff!  Coffee rub with a cherry bbq sauce on top of parsnip puree??? So good.  Different flavors all coming together to make a delicious meal.  My husband said that the scallops were the best he has ever had.  I kinda wished he had lied to me since I can't eat shellfish but I'm happy and surprised he said something like that.  He doesn't tend to rave about food that often.    The suggested dessert was the Peanut Butter Strata Bar. We went rouge and had the Pig in the Orchard.  Apple and bacon bread pudding with blueberry sauce and ice cream.   The bacon was not over powering but gave the dessert a smokey flavor.  It was interesting but it made me think about that Peanut Butter Strata Bar....   The service here was spectacular! You will be a very lucky patron if you sit in Sam's section.  In fact, you should ask for his section.  He knows everything about the menu, about the area, and about all things interesting!",

I was given water and menus right away. The hostess announced that it was happy hour, so I was 'coerced' into a beer.   Sam approached me shortly later and offered to explain the menu. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered the Chopped Salad and the Chia Seed Seared Ahi Tuna.   My salad arrived in 5 minutes. The salad I've had numerous times and there are dozens of reviews about it so I'll focus on the Ahi.   It arrived shortly after my salad bowl was cleared. It was presented with micro greens, fried leeks and an asparagus gastric. The Ahi was seared nicely and was a good portion. Pretty good but not great. I was pining for the fondues that surrounded me.   Sam was genuinely happy to greet all his guests and made me feel like an important part of the clientele. Very good customer skills.",

We had the famous chopped salad (good but not as awesome as I've read about here) the crab cakes (definitely yum!) the filet mignon tacos (nice) and the short ribs. The short ribs were tender and yummy but I think I would have preferred them served with mashed potatoes instead of the parsnip puree and kale. Maybe I'm just being picky. Service was great, wine selection was terrific too.",

I made reservations online for Hubby and I so when we got there we were seated immediately. If by chance you're having a bad day when you arrive, by the time EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE speaks to you on the way in AND the way out, you'll feel much better! The place was packed and there's much reason for it! Our waiter was Gary! Gary was PHENOM! When we come back, we're definitely requesting him! He was able to make some suggestions from the menu. I ordered from the restaurant week menu. You still have time! It goes through September 30. To start I had the original chopped salad with smoked salmon, Israeli couscous, arugula, pepitas, Asiago cheese, currants, marinated Roma tomatoes and some dried roasted sweet corn with buttermilk herb dressing that was to die for! Im actually planning to try the at home rendition this weekend! My second course was the pan seared scallops with the sweet corn grits. This was the perfect meal. It was a light 3 course meal and that's usually how I prefer it! Hubby ordered the salt cured pork shank! When that plate hit the table, I was like what on earth is he going to do with that! He showed me EGG ZACKLY what he was going to do with it! So he's from Alabama so it was as if home was on a plate in front of him. I declined the Mexican cookie sandwich that was my 3rd course. I instead tried a pomegranate and black tea sorbet. It was okay. The black tea was overpowering. The idea was great though. Allllll I can tell you is that you have to try the place for your self! We were quite impressed! We'll definitely be back! Thanks again Gary for your Uh MAZING service!!!!!",

We didn't get anything to eat but I'm sure it would've been good. The ambience is very classy with their white table settings, dimmed lights, and dark wood aesthetic. The bar in the center stood out but not in a bad way.   I got the Socialite and was very pleased with it. It was a fruity little drink but you knew it packed enough of a punch. The bartender was very attentive and checked in only when he needed to. It was busy enough where he has other things to do but he also chatted with patrons who seemed like regulars. I like that in a bartender because I don't need someone to chat with me when I'm already here with a friend but he was still able to come check on us right as we finished our drinks.

    "text": "I have been holding back recently on giving out 5 stars reviews but for the dinner I had last week at Citizen Public House, I gladly give them all 5. My dinner was outstanding. My husband has been there before and was raving about this place. He has been to Scottsdale 3x and has said that all 3x have been great. This says alot since the menu is ever-changing with the exception of a few favorites that are always on the menu (chopped salad and noble bread with some type of jam).   We made a quick reservation on Open Table and although we got there on time, we still had to wait a bit for our table. Not sure why as there were empty tables around, maybe they just had to catch up on things from earlier. Not sure.  We elected to have 5 starters versus any entrees because we couldn't choose between all the starters we wanted. Wow - so glad we made that choice because all 5 were great!   What we got: - Pork Belly Pastrami (my husband's favorite) - the meat was crispy and tender and the brussels sprout sauerkraut was really good - Burrata - least fave of all the appetizers but still really good. i think this dish would be great if we didn't have to compare it to the other 4 dishes. The cheese is pasteurized per the waiter which is great because I am pregnant, but was able to eat it. Very fresh and creamy. - Noble Bread Plate with bacon jam and black garlic butter - this was MY fave!!! geeez, i could have licked the plate. I am on a mission to learn to make this dish because I am so sad i cannot eat this every day of my life. I love bread but that jam and butter were just whoa... - Chopped salad - really good although it is exactly the same as the original stetson salad at Cowboy Ciao. Nevertheless, still yummy and a real real good salad. - Fried grit catfish - Yummy! The outside crust was really crispy and held onto the fish. Good portions. The cucumber relish that came with it was amazing too.  Not much else I can say. Service was good but the quality of the food was the star. Even though we only got starters, the portions were very fair and we were really full at the end of the night. We are planning to go back to Scottsdale next year (we are from SF) and this place will be on the top of our list of restaurants to eat!",

I would say the food was good but nothing out of this word or notable that would make me come back.  I got the chicken and my boyfriend got the meatloaf. Both were fine. We also each had salads and the cookie sandwich. Like I said nothing was bad but nothing to rave about.  The staff was friendly.",

The maitre d was good too bringing our daughter some crayons so she could draw on the paper tablecloth. It fell short for us when the entrees came out. The scallops - my order - were too fishy for me so I switched with my husband. He said they were good. I took his short ribs but actually could not enjoy them. They were dry even with the sauce and super sweet overall as a dish. It is possible Or even likely it was a reheat from yesterday because it didn't taste fresh or good. While it's not possible to please all guests it would have been nice if our server cared to do anything about it. After having he dish for one minute and trying it I made it clear I didn't like it. IlHe didn't seem to care and asked me to sit with It, pour the sauce. I didn't eat it. My husband ate most of it and I gave some to my daughter. I didn't want to try another main as I was concerned I wouldn't like it and end up paying for another dish. To top it off it was my birthday and I came away hungry. Do not recommend. Would not return.",

First of all, they know what they're doing. The ambiance is fabulous. In a sea of sports bars with TVs everywhere, the Citizen is breath of fresh air. No TVs. Dark Wood. Warm uplighting. Lots of conversation. Of all of the places we visited, this one had the most \"Northern California\" feel to it - some people were there in Tuxedos, some people were there in flip-flops. And everyone was obviously having fun.   Sitting at the bar, we got to know Thomas, the bar manager - who is a great guy, intelligent conversationalist, and passionate about making a perfect cocktail - and it shows. We deeply enjoyed the Salutation on multiple occasions, as well as the World's End, and I will say they make a mean Negroni.   The food was fantastic - the bacon fat heirloom popcorn was out of this world. I can't believe I've never thought of that. Perfectly air popped corn with chopped bacon pieces, dressed lightly in bacon grease danced on my tongue and gave me the mouthgasm I was looking for.  We loved the fondue, perfectly made sausage, bread, and asian pears with beer cheese. Aw yes. The burrata was absolutely fantastic and flavorful. We also decided on scallops one night, for which they are well known - GET THEM. I've never had scallops prepared like these.   Service: Excellent Ambiance: Excellent Food: Out of this world Cocktails: Delicious  My only wish is that they opened a little earlier, because I could've spent even more hours enjoying this place! Thank you Citizen for an awesome experience!",

    "text": "Citizen Public House  Citizen is my favorite place for happy hour when I'm in old town. Their cocktails are always strong and perfectly executed (thank you Brandon Casey), and there's a good selection for $6 on their happy hour menu. The Rose Garland with bourbon, Solerno blood orange, Sangue Morlacco (Luxardo) liqueur, and coffee-caramel bitters is my personal favorite, probably the best twist on an old fashioned I've ever had. They also make an awesome Bulleit julep.   You really can't go wrong with any of the food here, but you absolutely can't leave without getting Bernie Kantak's infamous chopped salad - smoked salmon, pepitas, freeze dried corn, Israeli couscous, bruschetta and arugula. The ingredients might sound a little strange together, but trust me, it's freaking magical. There's a reason this salad has its own Facebook page - it's basically a local celebrity. FYI: if you're ever flying out of Terminal 4 at PHX, you can pick one up to go at Cowboy Ciao by the B gates. The short ribs and scallops are my other favorites from their menu. And if somehow you saved room for dessert, the pot du creme is absolute heaven.   Don't forget to sign up for the In Good Spirits mailing list - you get a free chopped salad for your birthday!",

Love the Original Chopped Salad and the Mirliton Chopped salad a close second which is a bit more on the refreshing side. The sausage of the day has been a good choice.  The seared scallops can be done to your liking, mine request is rare and they do it  to perfection. I have asked my pork \"not too done\" and it comes lightly pink, just the way I like it.    Finish it off with a very rich and dense Irish Coffee Pot de Creme. Wish they would serve it in a less \"vertical\" glass so I can get the Irish whiskey, coffee crema and chocolate easily in a single spoonful.",

Our server, Gary, was great, although he did try to explain to me what pepitas and rapini was (um, thanks, but those are pretty easy ones). The best part was that our courses never felt rushed, and you actually had time between them to chat and relax.  We both started with our own chopped salads. If you're not a smoked salmon fan, they can substitute chicken. It was delicious--great mix of textures.   Hubby had the Berkshire pork loin, which I thought was just ok (I thought it was a little dry and lacked flavor, but he liked it). He loved the fruit compote on top but thought the white corn spoon bread was strange (it was fluffy yet dry). I had the scallops and loved every damn thing about that dish.  We finished with the bread pudding, which wasn't overly sweet or huge in size.  They didn't have many wines by the glass, and the ambience was pretty loud. Other than that, we thought it was a great meal out and would highly recommend it!",

It is suffering from an identity crisis in my opinion.    The food....meh.  The fondue beer dip was good, the mac and cheese was good.  The short ribs were fatty, the hamburger was rock hard and the hamburger bun dry, the chicken was o.k. and the salad was 'bitter'.    Definitely won't be on our rotation.",

    "text": "I have had nothing but great experiences at Citizen Public House. While I'll start off by saying that I know some of the items can be a bit overpriced, or possibly a lot overpriced, I'm taking into account the expensive Scottsdale location, and expensive real estate and booze licenses, so I will largely overlook it. Everything I've put into my mouth from here has been phenomenal, but I'll only really point you to one item, the meatloaf, it is unbelievable. I will judge every other meatloaf I ever meet against the CPH meatloaf. They also have inventive drinks, they even got me to enjoy gin, and I hate gin. The interior is nice, hip/modern, with an open feel and a nice bar as the centerpiece. I can't say that I'll be a regular here anytime soon, it's a bit of a drive from my house and there are other places that are basically as good but cheaper, but you can count on seeing me here from time to time, smile on my face and meatloaf in my mouth.",

I can only say that I only viewed the barrage of creativity displayed by all the mixologists on hand to stimulate our curiousity and to address our needs.  This place is not only offering an atmosphere that is warmed by its staff, it is offering a place that you can be guaranteed will appeal to all types of people because it is fantastically delicious! The menu is thoughtful.  No item seems misplaced and all is prepared matching seasonings with meats and veggies that are not always naturally paired.  I love the lamb meatballs with tzatziki sauce.  And who does ribs in a deep fried cherry BBQ sauce?  Where can you find a succulent lamb burger?  I mean these guys are even making their own ketchup.  You have to try the bread pudding too...don't play... it comes fondue style!    When I feel comfortable about the potential of a place to accommodate my discerning appetite, I usually ask about Cinzano and Campari.  I have often been disappointed, needless to say, by the absence of one or the other.  Rich actually one upped me.  He offered alternatively Compano Antica sweet vermouth.  I have never smelled such a great scent on a vermouth.  Wow.  I love it that we could speak the same language!  If you are looking for a traditional public house where you see the gang everyday after work, I think you'll be disappointed.  It is more of a special place to slip away with a new date, or a bunch of new friends, or to show off your town to loved ones visiting. It is special enough to add just the right flavour to Fifth Ave.  Cheers!",

The first time was about a month ago when we took a trip down to apartment hunt and the second was Halloween evening right after getting into town. We sat at the bar both times and chatted with the bartender, Brandon (?). Very, very nice guy. They have Kim Crawford on the wine list, which is one of our favorites so we ordered a couple glasses of that. We wanted a snack but nothing too heavy. The bartender suggested we get the chopped salad and being new to town and not knowing anything about anything, we trusted his suggestion. OMG. So delicious. I thought I would be disappointed seeing as you can get a chopped salad anywhere, but this salad is out of this world. I don't remember what all is in it, but it is fantastic. The salmon is like butter it's so perfect and melts in your mouth. We got to talking with the bartender and we work in the service industry up in Minnesota and Brandon gave us a service industry discount. So nice. The second time we went we each got our own salad and scraped the bowls. The bartender even remembered us! I got the Citizen cocktail which comes with a rock candy garnish which I thought was really cool. We wanted to get an entree, but with small wallets, we decided we would wait until next time. Thanks CPH! You have a couple new fans.",

Is there another place in town that features a ' sausage of the day'? Chorizo soup was the s-o-d this lucky night. A richly textured meal in itself, I piled on with the mac n cheese which could've earned the 5 stars on it's own. They offered to add sausage: Momma didn't raise no fool, I accepted.

    "text": "This was as good a meal as I've had in quite a while, and that includes places like New York and San Francisco.  The food is exciting and delicious--no tired old dishes that you've had elsewhere.  The service was up-beat and cheerful.  And the food came surprisingly fast.  The restaurant is beautiful and not particularly noisy, even at the height of the dinner hour on Saturday.  I was surprised to be able to get a reservation for such a good place at the last minute, but maybe they had a cancellation.   We picked it entirely based on Yelp reviews.  We were a party of four and had the following:  1. Rosemary roasted nuts.  A bargain at $5, you get a large quantity of roasted nuts, warm and elegantly served.  One serving was plenty for 4.  2. 'Tender Belly' bacon fat heirloom popcorn.  Another $5 bargain.  Popcorn like you've never tasted anywhere else.    3. Crispy Squid. $9.  A pile of lightly-fried squid and a light, delicious dipping sauce.  The pickled fennel on the side is amazing.  4. Mirliton Chopped Salad.   $12.  I seldom like salads, and most are nothing to write home about, but this one was a delightful mix of flavors and textures--including popcorn.  I only used half the dressing they give you because I wanted to taste the ingredients, and that was the right call.  Start out with half and add more of you really need it.  5. For my main course I had the Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs  $28   The meat was pretty much perfect--crispy on the outside, tender inside.  The parsnip puree and greens were to die for.  No kidding.  6. My wife (and one other person) had the Pan Seared Scottish Salmon.  $26.  She asked for it rare, and it came perfectly rare, though still crisp on the outside.  I had a bite and it was delicious.  There were plenty of delicious beets to go with it, so I had a few of those, and loved every bite.  7.  One person in our party had the Pan Seared Scallops.  $17.  They were large and seared to perfection.  The side dishes were delicious, like everything else.  8  We've been trying to stay off deserts, but couldn't resist, so we ordered one of each of the four:  Irish Coffee Pot de Creme  $10.  This came in two layers--the chocolate at the bottom and the cream on top, with an embedded wafer.  One of the best I've had.  The Strawberry Pound Cake. $9.  I'm not a fan of strawberries or pound cake, but this was ordered by someone else and I had a taste and thought it was pretty good anyway.  \"Pig in the Orchard\" Bread Pudding.   $9.  My wife and I had jokingly said ahead of time that if there was a desert that used bacon, we'd order it, so we had to order this when we saw the desert menu.  It was unusual and amazing.  Just goes to show there's no dish that can't be made better by addition bacon fat to it.  Finally, we had the Cookies and Milk.  $6.  There were several cookies served in a paper bag with a glass of milk.  We only tried one, being full by then, and that one was quite unusual and delicious.  We took the rest with us and we'll find out tomorrow, but I have every confidence they'll be great.  Oh, yes, I ordered a Moscow Mule as a drink and it was pretty much perfect:  Served in a metal mug (as it's supposed to be, but seldom is nowadays), it  was made with real ginger beer (not ginger ale) and came with slices of cucumber in the mug.  Surprising attention to detail for a $10 drink.  Everything was carefully prepared and beautifully presented,  The staff was responsive and upbeat without being obsequious.  Everyone seemed genuinely proud of the restaurant, and with good reason.  I've spent a lot more money on meals coast-to-coast, and can't remember when I've had as good a meal, as pleasant a dining experience or as great a value.  I'm anxious to go back and try some of the dishes on the menu that we missed this time, and will certainly go back in my next visit to the Phoenix area.",

We didn't have a reservation, and were told that it would be a 40 min wait, but we took a chance and hung out at the bar; we ended up seated at a table within 15 minutes. Our server Matt was very knowledgeable and friendly. We tried the delicious hand-chopped salad and the rosemary roasted nuts for starters, then enjoyed the short ribs and buttermilk chicken as our entrees. Matt was very patient with us, as we had a little trouble deciding on appetizers. We initially requested the pork belly pastrami, but changed our minds. Matt brought us the pastrami anyway and we tried it on the house - it was wonderful! The restaurant is a classy upscale place with soft lighting and hipster patrons; great environment but probably a little too loud for quiet conversation. We will definitely make time to come back here on our next trip Scottsdale!",

    "text": "Heard great things and was very excited to visit Citizen. Overall, I was glad it was not on my dime. I must have built the restaurant up in my mind. The entrance was quite nondescript and the interior the same. Dim lit, swanky vibe. Not bad but the only accents were old timey photos drilled into the wall through their frames. Hmm.  Service was good. A bit overbearing, but still very attentive.  My main beef is with the food and bev. I ordered the Protege cocktail. It tasted mostly of bitters with a hint of bourbon. We started with butternut squash gnocchi with pesto and bleu cheese. It was lukewarm and very dense. The pesto was nice, but there was not enough of it. My friends had salads for their entree (chopped and just the simple garden salad). They both loved them. I, on the other hand, went full force and ordered the short ribs. The parsnip puree and kale were nice. Not remarkable, but good. The short ribs, on the other hand, were very disappointing. They were at least 50% fat and seemingly \"glued\" to bone segments- for presentation's sake. The cherry glaze helped to cut the smoky flavor of the coffee-rubbed meat, but it couldn't disguise the fact that much of it was inedible.  I understand that kitchens do have off nights but, considering the price point, I will not return. I am more than willing to pay 30+ dollars for an entree, but you have to grab me on my first visit. Consistency is King.",

All this at very very reasonable pricing.  it is worth mentioning that the drinks are great here too!  I know it did not originate here, but this was the first place i had the \"original\" chopped salad. While it did not quite blow me away, it is different and delicious.   Over the course of my business trip, i was able to try most of the entrees here . I had the wagyu burger, the filet, tenderloin, and also the short ribs.   If it is your first time here, i would start with the chopped salad and the pork belly pastrami and choose the filet or short ribs as your entree.   Everything is good here though! The burger is excellent too!  stop reading and make that reservation!",

Within minutes we had a server taking our drink orders and asking for apps. The only negative is the kitchen still may be learning because our food took a while.  We ordered the fondue and popcorn for apps and they were both great. The only thing is they don't give you enough dipping food for the fondue but bring you extra for more money. The popcorn was unreal I mean bacon flavored popcorn who could ask for more?  For entrees our table ordered the scallops, chicken and chopped salad. All received great reviews. For dessert we order the bread pudding which was good not great. The bread pudding was a little bland but the makers mark ice cream was great.  I will be making the Citizen House a regular stop in my old town dinner rotation.",

I'm a bit of an indecisive orderer and am therefore appreciative of the servers' opinion. Gina gave honest, enthusiastic recommendations, not only with food but also our wine pairings.   Decor was dark and comfortable. They had a great bar set up as well and have a fantastic specialty cocktail and beer list. Next time we head back, we will plan to belly up and get our drink on!

    "text": "I have been here 3 times and I am torn between 3 and 4 stars. I have had a good meal here everytime but somethings are much better than others.   Lets start with the passables, which would be almost every sandwich or burger they have on the menu. Not to say that they are bad, but for $13 you can get a much better burger or grilled cheese sandwich at many other phoenix eateries. Another item i was unimpressed with was a Fish and Chips special which was priced at $20. It came out with 2 small panko crusted halibut filets and fries. It was a somewhat decent amount of food when you added the fries to the equation, but the batter was bland and the fish was dried out. Many other places around the valley have much better fish and chips for around half the price.  Moving on to the good menu items, I would have to start with the $32 Filet which is amazing. One of the best steaks I have had in arizona and equal and if not better in quality to one you would get at any high end steakhouses. Other good choices include the scallops, which were cooked perfectly and bursting with flavor. Another one of my favorites of this menu is the chopped salad which is fantastic and a must order.  I would review the desserts but I have never ordered one since none of them on the menu have caught my attention.  The service is always prompt and professional, they have a beer list and innovative specialty cocktails. The ambiance is above average and more intimate then most \"gastropubs\".  So all in all, would I go back? Yes, but only when i can afford to order a high priced and deliicious entree, otherwise I can get my burger or sandwich fix elsewhere.",

    "text": "Looking for a place in Scottsdale open late, my friend and I were very surprised to stroll into CPH at 9 pm and find a very classy place. As we were seated, we had this nagging feeling that we'd look at a menu that was $25 a plate or more. Thankfully, most of the menu was very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food, which I'll get into later.  The service was downright flawless. I wish I remembered the name of my waitress, because she was probably the most attentive waitress I've had in years. The atmosphere is classy, very white and black. However, the indie rock playing on the restaurant speakers reassured me that this was a place that was also comfortable with being casual as well, a juxtaposition that I am sure only exists in the state of Arizona.  Now, to the food. I wasn't in an appetizer mood, so I went right in with the Wagyu Burger. I am not kidding when I say THIS WAS THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF CONSUMING! I ordered it medium well, as is typical with me and burgers, but with the quality of the meat they used, I should have gone with medium at least in retrospect. Everything in the burger, the bun, the veggies, the cheese, the homemade mayo they had on the side, was flawless. The arugula fries on the side were some of the best fries I've ever had as well, and went amazingly well with their homemade ketchup.  The cocktails were expensive and didn't contain anything that particularly stood out at me, but I'm sure they're great if you like what's in them. I paired my burger with a Duvel, which is great because I can rarely find that beer anywhere and it went perfectly.  For dessert, I had the Cookies and Milk since I was feeling pretty full from the burger but still wanted a nice way to cap my evening. What I got was a bag of five of the best cookies I have ever tasted. They came in exotic flavors such as \"spicy chocolate fudge\" and \"apple bacon brittle oatmeal\" so if you want to take your sweet tooth on an adventure, I highly recommend it.  This is quite a place if you're looking for a classy joint to enjoy a few drinks and great food, especially kind of late or on a date. One of the best places in the area, IMO.",

Usually, his would not be a problem, but I had already sold myself on the side item for this entree -- corn grits! And needless to say, this southern influenced girl was sorely disappointed not to get my serving of grits :( but no fear, the waitress made sure I got my corn grits on the side.  The rest of their entree items looked fair, but nothing in particular stood out as a must have.  I settled on a halibut dish.  The appetizers list looked a bit more interesting...   The good: - The chopped salad is a must try (this appetizer has it's own Facebook page for crying out loud!) - The staff.  We were quickly greeted and sat at our table upon arrival, and our drink orders were taken and delivered to the table in record time.  Throughout our meal, my husband harassed the waitress for different selections of wine -- but she was a good sport. He is forever embarrassing me in public, so any spot that can put up with his drunken shenanigans is a win.  The not as good: - Best looking dish, scallops, was not available - My halibut was overcooked - We came in on a Sunday, and the place was half empty... But food still took long time to get cooked. I didn't mind this much, as I was not in a hurry. But if I had been on a schedule, this would surely been annoying - No cappuccino since machine was broken (boo)  Overall, i'd give this place a 3.5.  The chopped salad and friendly service was enough to make me overlook some of their lesser qualities.  I'd like to go back another time and see whether my experience is different--maybe I just caught them on an off night?",

    "text": "We visited this spot on a Thursday evening and snagged a table on the patio since the weather was so nice. First impressions from walking inside: it's quite dark and loud so the patio was a good option for us. The lovely Kelsey W. and I came here for their infamous chopped salads so when our waiter came by with our drinks, we let him know we were ready to order. She was able to make some dietary modifications to the salad which was nice, I kept mine as is. They came our relatively quick and we dug in and mixed them. It's a beautiful dish with an array of colors, textures and flavors. I must have been hungry because after I finished it, I could've gone for more. It wasn't like the chopped salad at Cowboy Ciao but it was still good. We just missed their happy hour so maybe next time that will be an option.",

We had the fondue, hummus plate, and bacon popcorn and all were extremely delicious. We also had a $3 beer and one of the barrel aged cocktails. Josh was our server and He was superb; he was so kind and attentive. This was one of the best happy hours I have ever been to and some of the best service as well. I wish I lived in the area because I would come frequently if I could. We hope to return later on our trip for dinner too because that looked amazing as well.",

    "text": "This place has a super cool vibe.  Definitely worth taking your significant other or family out to a nice dinner.  We went during new years eve 2017 and the place was super packed but my fiance and I were able to find a seat at the bar.  The bartender was awesome and a True mixologist.  It was nice to sit at a bar where they don't serve you the traditional \"club\" style drink but offer you some nice options of gin, barrel aged whiskey, and bourbon to sip and talk through the night.  Using ingredients such as bitters and vermouth in their arsenal along with house made sweeteners like popcorn syrup makes their drinks that much more special.  My only gripe with the whole experience was that they ran out of filet mignon.  Not sure if they ran out or if they were saving it for the everyone else in the dining room who had the \"new years eve set menu\".  I was told I could get anything a la carte at the bar but that was one item they didn't have.    I settled for the meat loaf and my fiance had the shellfish soup.  Both were delightful (sorry for the awful pics as this place is very dimly lit).  Overall a great experience.  Would definitely come back for the cocktails and maybe try their dinner service next time we're in town",

The service I've had sitting at a table was bar none the server was friendly, knowledgeable and went above and beyond to accommodate my serious food allergy. He didn't make me feel like it was an inconvenience or that i should worry he didn't know what was in any of the dishes. I've sat at the bar a few times and although the food is always fantastic the bar staff was not attentive both times. They seem to be chatting up each other or they are talking to regulars/friends at the bar for 20 min and don't turn around to notice you want another drink. The food especially the sea scallops and the original chop salad which has its own Facebook page (and well deserved in my opinion) are FANTASTIC. A little pricey overall but still - great for a night out with someone special.",

    "text": "Had dinner here yesterday around 6pm.  Pretty busy spot; we sat at the bar.  Bartenders were on top of their game=courteous, constant check-ins but not to the point of being annoying or interrupting.  It was nice; we never had an empty glass or had to wait to order anything.  Food came out with impressive speed + accuracy; from what I am told, they are known for their salad...which the presentation in itself is pretty cool.  It comes with all parts separated, and the server pours the dressing and stirs for you.  I didn't order the salad but my friend did and as entertaining as that was to watch, personally I would have felt lazy and like a child if in his position.  I don't know, maybe I'm weird (that's actually a hard YES) but I wouldn't be able to let another grown person stir up anything for me...it'd be like having mommy tie on my bib and cut up the meat.  That went down a pointless rambling road, so back to the actual review--- For the record I think it's amazing when a restaurant knows how to cater to and make their customers feel special.  Shows True initiative and really stands out from the carbon copy restaurant style.   For drinks I had this killer what I think was a Moscow Mule (came in a standard MM cup so...) but with cranberry and pomegranate.  Was on happy hour drink menu and was so yummy!  And sneaky!!  Another reason I found the bartenders to be so great is there was just 4 mins left on happy hour when we arrived but more than 1 of them made sure we all got our orders in to get the HH rates.  Baddest-a$$ bartenders.   Food was decent, and they have this bomb bread pudding and jam with ice cream thing that really hit the spot after dinner.  I don't know what crack is like, but that's gotta be somewhere within the family of that dessert.  Anyway, overall they killed it.  Will def be back.",

The inside of the restaurant is classic and comfortable with an upscale feel. We split the chopped salad, burratta and mac and cheese as appetizers. The chopped salad was mixed right at our table and one of the best salads I've ever had. The mac and cheese is super light and a big sized portion topped with a refreshing tomato relish. The burratta is served with bread over an amazing cauliflower and tomato mix.  For entrees we had the Pan Seared Scallops, Chula Swordfish and Fair-trade short ribs. Everything was amazing. The scallops are served over a unique and delicious corn grits. I personally ordered the swordfish and it was light, perfectly grilled and served over zucchini noodles with a light burre blanc sauce.   I would highly recommend having a meal here if you're in town.",

    "text": "We had a wonderful anniversary dinner at Citizen PH.  We arrived early hoping to get in earlier than we could get a reservation for and had a beer at the bar while we waited. I had the locally favorite Scottish ale and it was a great beer. My husband was happy with his IPA. The beer menu ran toward lighter beers. Our bartender reminded us that it's usually warm in Scottsdale.  When we got to our table we told our server it was our anniversary but didn't think we'd be able to eat a full three course meal. He suggested splitting an entree, but we wanted to taste each other's food so we didn't go that route. We decided to go with appetizers rather than dessert. Great decision. The crab cakes were excellent with a rich sauce that did not overpower the delicate crab. It was one of those lovely dishes that just tasted better and better the more bites you took.  For dinner my husband went with the smoked duck breast served over a bed of spinach and polenta underneath. It was very rich and he loved every bite. Since it was smoked, it was much rarer than I usually eat poultry and with a rare texture. A truly unique dish, and because there were three good size portions of the breast, plenty of food for a hungry eater.   I had the trout served on a bed of succotash with okra. The trout was both filets cooked perfectly and seasoned well. There was an intriguing flavor in the broth of the succotash that complemented the trout well. About half way through our entree Josh brought over two half glasses of Prosecco so we could have an anniversary toast. It was a lovely unhurried dinner with just the right amount of attention from our waiter.  If we had dessert I'm sure it would have been the chocolate layer cake which looked wonderful. It was two rounds of chocolate cake fill with a mouse or cream of some sort and with a dollop of whipped cream in top. Maybe next time! If you go expect a lovely festive meal and ask for Josh as your server.",

Sometimes, you wonder why there's so many positive reviews. Well, that's because this place is awesome. Our service was wonderful throughout our entire meal, even with two terrible toddlers, they were very accommodating. For appetizers we started with their hummus and pita and those yummy pickles and definitely get this as a starter because it was delicious. Then we got a few of their chopped salads with chicken as we heard how amazing they are and they truly do live up to the hype as they were awesome and we gobbled them right up. I also got their version of mac n cheese, mostly for my toddlers, yet I ended up eating half of it as it was very good.  For our entrees we got a bunch of different things but the stand outs were the short rib tacos that just melted in your mouth and the duck burger which is what my dad got which he seemed to like but that is a huge portion I must say. I wanted to try the happy hour mussels as well but we were getting stuffed by this point so I decided to save room for dessert and I'm glad I did. The chocolate mouse with carmel cup and bits of cookies on top, can't remember the name but it literally is one of a kind, I seriously devoured the entire thing with a few spoons that I let my mom share. Wow, it was that good and probably my favorite thing of the evening. I will definitely come back here when I come to Scottsdale again as it has amazing food in a pretty casual yet still nice atmosphere. Definitely a top five in the area!!",

    "text": "I walked in at 10:30 on a Friday and the bartender was so kind. Made me a mezcal drink (it was a long day - I didnt ask what it was). And it was perfect! I asked for spirit forward but refreshing and he delivered! I know there was also green chartreuse... if that helps.  I had the chopped salad. No idea it was so famous but two people commented on it... and I know why. It is like your slightly gourmet version of a cobb salad without the gross romaine, boiled egg and hard chicken. So nothing like a cobb salad, actually. All the ingredients paired well with the dressing and it was not overly robust. I was glad cous cous was on it so I could consume it as a meal.   While this is a nice restaurant, it is not at all pretentious. When traveling alone, atmosphere means everything. The bartenders were the best treat after a six hour day. It was so nice to enjoy good food and drinks past 10 pm and have it not be a stuffy environment! I feel like that is my bliss point and they met it.   Next time I make the trek out here from San Diego, I am coming back.  I wish I knew the bartenders names... one had a dark brown pony and beard (he ended the night) and was accommodating. He made the drink great, as well as the gentleman that initially served me. Both sweet, attractive and great bartenders. What more could you ask for, ya know ;)",

If you're looking to entertain a client or have a fun night out, I highly Recommend Citizen public house",

The meatloaf is very filling; it comes with mashed potatoes that is so velvety and buttery. I loved the sauce that came with the scallops.  2. Convenient location; lots of parking (free) 3. Food arrives quickly  Cons: 1. The restaurant is very dimly lit. 2. Extremely loud, not from the music but from so many people packed into one room 3. The actual restaurant doesn't look as nice as in the pictures. The place is kind of plain.   Definitely a place to go to for the food more than the ambience, and I would go during an off peak time so that you can hear what your dinner mates are saying.",

    "text": "Old Town is a charming area in Scottsdale filled with cowboy western themed places and nestled among all of it is this classy foodie paradise.  On a Saturday night this place is popping with people. The restaurant is dimly lit and the ambience is casual cool.  A good place for a group of friends, but a bit loud for a romantic date.  You have to start your meal with their Facebook famous Original Chopped Salad ($13).  All you need to know is it's not your typical salad and don't get put off by the smoked salmon, it isn't overpowering like you might think.  All of the flavors work amazingly together.  For an entree, I had the Pan Seared Scallops ($28). They were perfectly cooked and went very well with the creamy grits and crisp bacon crumble.  The only thing that could've made the dish better would've been having one more scallop.  They have a list of craft cocktails and aged liquor to accompany your meal.  The Highlands Drifter is a tasty sweet drink made with vanilla infused tequila.  For a something refreshing and fruity, but not as sweet, the Second Generation martini is a good choice.  The servers here are great at what they do.  They're knowledgable about the food and friendly.  My entire experience from start to finish was enjoyable.  Next time I'll have to save room for dessert.",

I was literally yelling across the table to try and have a conversation.  In the end we gave up trying to talk.   Our meals were a contrast in extremes. I ordered the duck  burger and my husband ordered the game hen.   The server warned that my meal was going to be large. He should have warned that the Cornish game hen meal was super small.    The Cornish game hen was described by my husband as \"fine\".  I on the other hand thought my duck burger was seriously tasty. I wisely halved my burger before I started eating it.   I was going to order dessert, as the menu looked so good. Glad I didn't as my neighbor on the table seated to my left ordered what I was going to the red chocolate cake with mousse etc. when I saw what he received I re thought my order. It appeared a little to pretentious and decidedly not as decadent as the menu described   All in all it was a good food experience. The noise was the big downer of the night",

Upon arrival, we were greeted and told to have a seat in their waiting area (we may have been about 5 minutes early). However, the slight disappointment came when we were now waiting 20 minutes past our reservation time.   After the unacknowledged and unapolgetic wait from the front staff, we were finally seated at the most awkward booth ever. It was shaped like a really short rainbow which forced us to awkwardly stare at two girls about a foot away eating their dinner. As it was quite uncomfortable for us, I'm sure it was even more strange for them.   With regards to the food and beverages, here's what we ordered: Amaro Meatloaf, Duboc Pork Loin, their Black and Tan for dessert, and a Sour Pisco and Tipperary to help wash it all down.  I can't say there was anything extraordinary about this place or the list of things they have for you to consume but most of it was better than your average with one exception: the Black and Tan. I truly think this is their money maker. I'm not too big on sugary things but this was absolute perfection - the kind that makes a Negative Nancy want something fancy.",

Two of us stopped by this place on a Tuesday evening while on our business trip after consulting Yelp. Even on a (mid)weekday evening, the inside of Citizen (although not full) was very lively (as opposed to other restaurants that seemed empty!). I love the fact that they had a list of MANY cocktail drinks for you to choose from. The waitress was great at recommending some vodka-based cocktails that my friend would like as well! For food, we opted for:  Appetizers: 1) Pork Belly Pastrami and 2) Chopped Salad. Both dishes were excellent! The pork belly was tender and with a mustard-based sauce and a bed of vegetable (I forgot what the veg was) while the chopped salad was so refreshing! (probably the bacon made it taste so great!  Main dish: 1) Seared Scallops and 2) Crispy Steelhead. The seared scallops were also great and came with saucey looking food of what tasted like mashed potato. The steelhead was actually a fillet (instead of whole fish) and I love their green pea risotto that came with it. Honestly, I actually like their appetizers more and thought the main dish was quite large (well, since we had 2 appetizers already!)...but the food was very good still!  Dessert: Pina Colada Bread Pudding (heaven~~~)...tasted/smell of toasted coconut was so aromatic after we took a bite of dessert. I'm normally not a dessert person but since the food here was so good (both appetizers and main dishes), I was glad we tried their dessert out, too!  All in all, the bill came to around $90 without tip including 2 cocktails)...really reasonable!! highly recommend this place as a place to hang out! Judging from the fact that it was actually crowded even on a Tuesday evening, I do have a feeling this place gets really crowded on Friday/weekend though!",

It was so phenomenal that I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to get here!  My friend and I decided Restaurant Week was the perfect opportunity for our inaugural visit. Our server was Kent, and he was fantastic. Hilarious, knowledgeable about the menu, and just all around gave amazing service. Good service is very surprisingly hard to find in a metro area with a bzillion restaurants, and he was great. We ordered a bottle of Prosecco to split, because obviously, and got to eating!  I started with the roasted beet salad, which I was told they were testing out to see if they want to put on the regular menu. Dear CPH: YES PLEASE. The combo of the sweet roasted beets, goat cheese, tomatoes, frisee, and arugula pesto was such a refreshing way to start a summer meal. For my entree I chose the Chicken \"Caesar.\" Guys, I know chicken can be \"boring,\" but I didn't eat meat for almost 11 years and now really only eat chicken or turkey. This was OUTSTANDING. The chicken breast was so juicy and tender and perfectly grilled. It came served with grilled radicchio, a cauliflower puree, some ciabatta croutons and a soft boiled egg half. It was an amazing combination of summery flavors and textures. Try as I might, I couldn't finish it all...but I COULD order dessert! The Black and Tan chocolate pot de creme was layered with salted carmel pudding (I know.) and came served with a browned butter shortbread cookie. Repeat: browned butter shortbread cookie. That's all you need to know.  All in all, our evening was glorious. I will say, the next time I visit (AND THERE WILL BE MANY MORE NEXT TIMES) I might request to sit on the small patio, as it got pretty loud inside the dining room. Other than that...CPH, you are ACES!",

    "text": "Definitely one of the better restaurants in the Phoenix area. The food and service were excellent. I made a reservation for a large group and they gave us our own little alcove to sit in and we had a server all to ourselves. His name was Sean and he did a fantastic job.  The drinks were wonderful. I had a Tin Cup and a Liberator Punch. The Punch was better than the Tin Cup but they were both really good. I enjoy sweeter drinks but my husband had Manhattan and said it was great.  For dinner, I had the steelhead trout. The pickled beet salad with it was very good and the fish was cooked perfectly. I'd love to find out what they seasoned the fish with because it was perfect. My husband had the meatloaf and let me try a bite and it was very tasty. My friend had the scallops and she let me try a bit of the grits and she's lucky I didn't snatch the plate away from her. I'm wondering if they'd just sell me some of those grits.  I also managed to mooch bites of the infamous Original Chopped Salad (which is really pretty before they toss it all together) and the short ribs. Both were excellent.  For dessert, my husband and I split a Pig in the Orchard which is bread pudding with apple and bacon. A most excellent combination. We also took home a bag of the Pecan Bacon Brittle which is as awesome as it sounds.  I definitely plan to go back and have my own plate of grits, um, scallops.",

Considering the source (yours truly) has 2080+ reviews you can betcha this meal was pretty incredible.  My large party of 15 or so people was waited on by the oh so fabulous Gary, who did his best to provide serious VIP treatment. Gary started the meal by bringing out the popcorn bacon appetizer...can't go wrong with that combo! From there I had the chopped salad, which I've been dreaming about ever since. I opted for mine with chicken instead of smoked salmon (looking out for the little guy). It's the best salad I've ever had and I bet it's even better with salmon.  I ordered scallops for my main entree and they were delish, but I was too full to eat more than 1 (it comes with 30). Somehow I made room for a few bites of the variety of heavenly desserts Gary brought out to our table to end our oh so fabulous meal.  Guess where I'll be eating during my next trip to Scottsdale? Yep, Citizen House...and hopefully by then I'll be able to indulge in those cocktails everyone is yelping about!",

Seated right before happy hour ended at 6 so tried the half price house barrel-aged cocktail special - a horchata based drink that was so good!  Moved to the cocktails and tried the Clover Club, a pretty raspberry drink and the Mezcacillin, a gingery citrus tequila wonder.  Between the table I believe we tried every cocktail - a bit pricey at $12 each but consensus was some of the best cocktails in AZ.  Appetizer: the Burrata - buttery soft cheese over a cauliflower romesco and grilled ciabatta bread.   Salad: the Chopped - interesting flavors/textures with smoked salmon, freeze dried corn, pumpkin seeds, greens and Israeli couscous covered in ranch dressing.    Dinner: the Scallops - served over corn grits with bacon.  Nicely seared, melt in your mouth.  And, the Short Ribs - boneless, fall apart medallions with a sweet cherry sauce and greens.    All in all a great dining experience and our Server, Ann, was the icing on the cake!",

The bread is not special but the bone marrow butter is freaking delicious that comes with it. There also was sundried tomato with it that isn't 5 stars but still okay. Unfortunately it is the cocktails that make it lose a star. It was the size of my pinky and 12 dollars. Thanks for the service. Highly recommended for the food.

We also ordered the buttermilk chicken, which was good but nothing special, and the scallops, which were extremely salty - on the border of being inedible.

My first reflection is that the place looks much more cosy on the pictures and that the sound level is very high. Feels more like a bar with food then a restaurant.    The food then......  I had the fair trade short ribs with coffee rub , dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted  parsnip puree and seasonal veggies for 28 $. I love shortribs if they are made right and the coffee rub made me think of the calfs liver in coffee/veal reduction i loved at Ralp Lauren's Bistro in Chicago so i had high hopes for this dish.    Im sad to say that i didnt feel that Citizen Public House delivered.  The short ribs (on the bone) was tender and not bad put i could taste any of the coffee rub. The cherry bbq sauce was so so and the parsnip puree that might have been the best thing on the plate was not veru much of. It was a smaller \"pile\" hidden under the veggies that also was ok.   My companys file of beef was better in my opinion but at 120 $ for two mains and 2 glasses of red i think this place was a little to expensive for the food and the experience. With so much great food in Scottsdale i just dont think this place is worth the hype.   Service was ok but nothing special. Location in old town is great though!",

It was a Monday right when they opened at 2:00 pm so it would have been easy to expect poor service. Absolutely not the case.   In all my years I've never met a more knowledgable bartender. He is very committed to his craft and provided great information about the drink choices and the food menu as well. Very easy to talk to, polite and just a great overall guy.   I had a craft beer and my wife a glass of wine. My wife is very knowledgeable about wine and the suggestion by the bartender was a perfect fit for her pallet.   My only regret is that we had already eaten lunch. The bacon popcorn was amazing and I have no doubt the rest of the menu is as well.   We will be back here again for lunch/dinner and if the same bartender is working I know where we will be sitting.   Just flawless in all aspects.

The popcorn really lacked any flavor so a handful is best enjoyed with some bacon to add the required saltiness.    I also heard great things about the pork belly pastrami so had to order it.  I really enjoyed this dish, in fact this is the best dish I had and will order it again.  If I could do it over I would just order this dish and my drinks and I would of gave it five stars.   However please read on....  OK also ordered the Butternut Squash soup and it was ok.  Not really great, just an ok dish that I would never order again.  It just did not have any spectacular flavors or any wow factor like the pork belly pastrami.  I also ordered the main entree short rib.  It came with a cherry sauce that I would never eat again.  If you smelled the cherry  sauce directly it would clear your sinuses.  It was so strong that if you inhaled it directly it would make you cough.  Not really an appetizing sauce.  It had a bitterness to  it that really was not good at all.  After coughing twice from breathing in the sauce with my short rib I stopped using it all together.  The short rib on its own was ok.  Not worth the coin and only an ok dish.  I would not order it again.  The atmosphere of Citizen Public House is great.  Very lively and great service.  I plan on visiting again for happy hour to enjoy appetizers, pork belly pastrami and drinks.  I suggest you do the same.",

    "text": "The steak salad - mouth & mind-blowing... seriously, go get it now. Chopped salad? Always a favorite, but also available at Cowboy Ciao. The fried chicken (incredible) and waffle (inedible) left us wanting more fried meat, but the truly stellar service made us forget about food we didn't care to eat.  A warning: the dessert is NOT worth 10 dollars,  Not nearly as interesting as the description implies, They were standard, too small, and left much to be desired...  the apple pie, cheesecake, and bread pudding just tasted like lies.  The ambiance, romantic, and service, quite grand. The main courses were great (though the waffle was bland). You're likely to leave CPH full of quality cuisine and glee, and if it's yo birthday, they'll give you fudge balls, fo' free.",

I don't know if everyone else here just came on a better night with a different staff or what, but this was not the dining experience you all described.  But the worst was the service and attitude of the staff; we were ignored all night.   It took us a very long time to get seated despite it NOT being full and having a reservation. Not a big deal, but a party of 8 walked in ahead of me and was immediately seated. I guess CPH would make more money off of a larger party, so they were made a priority over someone who had the common sense to make a reservation.  The server was affable and friendly but would disappear for long stretches of time.  It seemed like everyone working there was more concerned with enforcing the cool hipster vibe than actually doing any work.  I was pretty excited to eat here because they had a great rating. However, my entree was a major disappointed and it took a major dent on my wallet. I will pay anything for good food. However, nothing makes me more angry than overpaying for a crappy entree. I ordered the short ribs based on a recommendation. They were extremely fatty, tough, and nearly burnt. Furthermore, the sides were also a disappointment. I don't think pureed parsnips are particularly expensive, but the portion I received was a joke. I was done with them within 2 bites. What a way to waste my time and money.",

The restaurant itself is really nice. We came around 9:30-10 for a late dinner so I guess it explains why they were blasting the music for Saturday night but it was pretty hard to hold a conversation.   I got the Persian cocktail which was tasty but I prefer fruitier drinks so I'll probably order something different next time.  For my entree, I got the lamb burger which was pretty disappointing. It had a grainy consistency and wasn't seasoned well. I usually love lamb especially with tzaziki sauce but I could hardly taste any of that on my burger. The fries were excellent though. They give you a pretty large portion. The house ketchup is delicious but it's a little too sweet for my taste. I usually need a more tart or sour ketchup with my fries but this ketchup is pretty sweet and almost tastes like apple pie? My boyfriend got the meatloaf which was delicious. The mashed potatoes were were good with the gravy.",

    "text": "Finally, I got to dine here! It was well worth the wait. I came here last Friday (2/22) to take advantage of the last day of AZ Cocktail Week. Usually this place is really busy and it's hard to get a table without a bit of a wait. Thankfully, we made reservations!   This place is so cool. The atmosphere is really hip and classy. I had been here (and Citizen R + D) a few times before but wanted to wait until I tried the food to make a review.   I had the Negroni cocktail, which was..alright. I mean, I can't really judge a drink when I've never had it before and it wasn't my cup o' tea but I'm sure if you like gin you'd enjoy it! I've had their Moscow Mule before and the Cotton Cooler (at R + D) so I'm confident in their cocktail skills.   There aren't too many veg options on the menu. There were a few things that caught my eye though-the mac n cheese and the grilled cheese sandwich. In the battle of which cheesy dish to select, I went with the grilled cheese since it seemed like a healthier option (the only healthy aspect being that it came with a field greens salad). Let me just say..this might've been the best grilled cheese I've had IN MY LIFE. This sandwich was not only melty cheese goodness, but had truffled mashed potatoes and onions on it. The salad was pretty delicious too, but the sandwich was definitely the standout.   The service was really good and our server was very informative on the menu & friendly. It was a great dining experience! And I will probably try to recreate the grilled cheese at home. It was that good.",

    "text": "Came for a late lunch/early dinner date with the husband. I had high expectations from all of the rave reviews. Ordered the Kiltlifter Fondue which comes with Asian pear, bread, and a wee bit of spicy sausage. It was good, but I kinda wanted a really cheesy fondue, and this one is more of a cheesy liquid sauce. Overall, pretty good but not rave-worthy.   We ordered the Lamb Burger and the Truffle Grilled Cheese. The lamb burger was... ok. It wasn't anything special or delectable. I've definitely had better lamb burger/sandwiches other places. The components were all there and decent, especially the bread, but the meat was just lacking. And the Kennebec fries? They were aight. Not crack as some other Yelpers have claimed.   The Grilled cheese was uber cheesy - probably the best thing we ordered. The mashed potatoes were an interesting addition and tasty... but I hate when my sandwich fillings spill out when you take a bite. It was really a great, tasty sandwich, but could have used a side of tomato soup to add a zing to it. The side salad was a great mix of cranberries, cashews, goat cheese, tomatoes and balsamic dressing.   Our waitress was wonderful and did a great job of keeping our glasses filled, BUT it took a loooooooong time to get our food, and we were one of 4 SMALL parties dining at that time. And I didn't feel that our orders were complicated. I dunno, but it was a really really long wait. And on a somewhat random side note, the bathrooms, while clean, smelled absolutely horrid. Like hold-your-breath-hurry-up-and-get-outta-here horrid.  Now.... would I come back? Yes, to try the pastrami and scallops that are so raved about, but I'm in no rush to do so. And I will also plan on using the loo elsewhere beforehand.",

We went with our couple friends and sat at one of the half moon shaped booths by the back wall which arguably was the best table in the house. To start, do yourselves a favor and get the chopped salad - its unique, refreshing, just the right amount of flavor and has its own Facebook page. They presentation is impeccable and they mix and dress it table side - the dressing (buttermilk pesto) is INSANE. Then you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, except if you skip out on the scallops. They melt in your mouth. The pork shank is like a dinosaur bone so bring your appetite. Also, try the pork cheek - I was very hesitant but the fennel and caramelized onion really balance it out. To finish, we did the Black and Tan for dessert - the layers of chocolate, salted caramel and some other whipped ingredient from heaven was the perfect finish. ;)",

    "text": "OMG, you guys, I think I'm in love.  Maybe I've been stuck in the suburbs for too long, but I was so impressed with Citizen.  I finally had a chance to check it out, and during \"social hour\" no less.  I had been hearing about those barrel aged cocktails, so I had to give one a try.  I don't normally go for the bourbon and whiskey cocktails, so the waiter recommended the Pacific Coast Cocktail, and described it as \"sort of their version of sangria\".  It was really good, really strong and $5 to boot (during social hour).  I had to switch to wine after that because I didn't want to get completely wasted in front of a bunch of strangers.  I also took the liberty of ordering the bacon fat popcorn for the table because Holy Jesus.  Bacon.  Popcorn.  How could you go wrong?  You can't, and this was truly sent from heaven.  Or hell, maybe.  Either way, it was freaking amazing and I would eat it every day if I could.    I ordered the Short Rib, much to my boyfriend's chagrin.  I always seem to order what he wants, and then he has to order something else (sorrynotsorry).  Oh Lord, not to be a yelp stereotype here, but it was TO DIE for.  Short Rib?  Amazing.  Parsnip Mash?  Why didn't I think of this?  Swiss Chard?  Yes.  And it is gluten free, for those of you on that food trip.  Our waiter was totally on top of things, made great suggestions, and was super sweet.  Basically, everything I ask for in a waiter.  And the atmosphere?  Yes, it has that \"cool, hipster vibe\" described by other reviewers, but I like it, and I didn't find it pretentious or snobby at all.    Overall, I want to go to CPH like EVERYDAY, but alas, I cannot.  I will settle for going as often as I can to enjoy their delicious food and libations.  And I encourage you to do the same.",

    "text": "In town for a conference, so decided to grab dinner here with a couple of friends from work. Looking at the menu ahead of time, I was drawn to the bacon fat popcorn and figured either this would be awesome or it was going to be an absolute bacon-trend disaster of a meal.  It was outstanding.  We arrived and the place was fairly busy.  Definitely energetic but not to the point where one couldn't carry on a conversation without shouting.  Started of with some of the house cocktails and bacon fat popcorn and the kilt lifter fondue.  Cocktails were strong, yet balanced and flavorful.  The popcorn was ridiculous, not greasy or over-the-top, with pieces of crisp bacon scattered throughout.  The kilt lifter fondue was equally tasty.  We decided to try several items off the starter menu- waffles and fried chicken, pork belly pastrami, and the original chopped salad.  My co-worker went nuts over the fried chicken and waffles, saying it was some of the best he's ever had (must have been good because he's from the south and knows his way around a fried chicken).  Now, I'm a guy who knows a thing or two about pastrami and making pastrami with pork belly just didn't seem, well, kosher.  If there was ever a case to plead for allowing pork to become kosher, this would be the dish you'd have to serve the Rabbi.  It was insane and would make even the staunchest Rabbinical authority issue a blessing.  I didn't try the chopped salad, but the person in our group who ordered it said it was outstanding.  Overall, solid choice and will be back next trip to Scottsdale.",

The location gives diners on the small patio a fantastic quiet and quaint streetside view with white lights, trees and the occasional horse-drawn carriage clomping by. Loved the list of handcrafted, unique cocktails. My Citi-Zen hit just the right note of tanginess with a hint of ginger, sweet and sour and pear vodka. Our server treated us like old friends with some great info on the cocktails and dishes. We felt like we were in an established neighborhood joint and not some corporate clone place! Started with the incredibly addictive bacon popcorn and then moved to several starters - the crab cakes were light and full of crab, not filler, with a tangy slaw; the fondue is really fun and rich with a combo of apples, sausage and bread to dip. The lamb burger reminded us of a very fancy gyro - rich lamb flavor tempered by the creamy sauce and a fantastic bun. Overall a fun, tasty and satisfying experience. If you don't want a big dinner, there is a long list of bar noshes and starters along with full entrees.",

Bernie's legendary chef's salad at $10 made a superb shared starter, followed by an organic chicken breast served over a rice pilaf. The wine list is excellent and extremely well-priced by today's Scottsdale standards(Lyeth Meritage for $9 per generous serving). Our waitperson, Ashley, was extremely attentive and enthusiastic.

Maybe it's all in the name, nevertheless I was disappointed. The food was above average probably deserving more them three stars but everything else was average at best. Well except the lighting, that seemed to be the perfect level of dim. The decor was bland, the walls seemed stark, random plastic house plants were the only decoration other then the poorly framed and hung black and whites. As you can probably already tell my disappointment lies almost totally in the ambiance. It just lacked that something cool that many other restrantuants in the Phoenix area these days have. But like I said the food was above average, i had the burger and it was good (the fries are exceptional). The service was very good and there are some good specialty drinks that were well made.  I would recommend at least 5 other places to try before this one especially given the price.",

    "text": "I left a tip, but a further review is necessary. I have to start out by saying that I was skeptical about coming here. But my wife hyped it so much for the bacon-fat popcorn. I was excited that they had chicken and waffles(as being a huge fan, and eating at many chicken/waffle places, i.e. Roscos in LA, LoLo's, etc.) I must say, honestly... pathetic. the chicken was over fried, dry, burnt and thigh meat to top it off. The waffle was a tiny 3inch square, with not syrup, but honey. And rather bland as well. Upon stating my dis-satisfaction to my waitress, she offered me my choice of different food from the menu. I chose the AZ BLT, per her request. And, I was blown away. the bacon was orgasmic(for lack of better terms), it buckled my knees with its perfection of tenderness and semi salty flavor. As a man who loves crispy bacon(almost burnt), this was a dance of flavor that is matched by few. The combination of the fresh greens, campari tomato, carmelized french bread and aioli mayo made this \"basic\" classic dance on the tastebuds. Total redemption was achieved, and I would recomend this place to anyone. Also, having happy hour 7 days a week does'nt hurt either. good prices and drinks.",

The waitress turned out to be the same one that helped us when we ate at Cowboy Ciao a few months back.  The calamari we ate was outstanding...the best tasting I've ever had.

The place opens at 3 PM, allowing for \"bar bites\" and many wines, beers, and cocktails at a reduced price. This makes it ideal for post-baseball day games. The drinks are very creative, and they have many premium wines and beers. Five of us had a variety of appetizers and entrees that are again, creative, and generous in terms of portion size. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

We only had an hour to eat before our plane left so we quickly ordered the legendary Chop Salad and 2 hot dogs (they were a special on the menu that night). The salad is famous for a reason. It's phenomenal. And the hot dogs? Crazy good. Just great attention to detail in every aspect of the experience (including the great music mix on the stereo). Our server (Dina? Gina?Sorry) was all class and good humor and very knowledgable. At the end of the meal Bernie, the chef and owner, came out to say hi. We probably freaked him out with our excitement level but it was all genuine. We live in the SF Bay Area, a mecca for food, but I would I would gladly trade a few artisanal pizza joints for a Citizen in our neighborhood. Here's wishing them all the best with their impressive new venture.",

The ambiance too was well set as the place could hold large parties very comfortably.   We began the nigth with a bottle of wine, the original chopped salad alons with the rock shrimp.  All were exceptional!  As out main courses, my wife orded the sea scallops and I ordered the short ribs.  (Peter of Cowboy Ciao's must miss this guy.)  Both dinners were cooked to perfection and the staff never left alone.  For dessert, we had coffee and the evening's special, the donut holes with three dipping sauces.  All were fantastic.

Instead I ordered the chopped salad and I was happy with it, though would have ordered a main course instead if something small and light would have been offered.    The rest of our party ordered main course's and I tried all of them, the roasted parsnip puree was awesome and so were the scallops.  The BBQ dipping sauce for the short ribs was very heavy and the short ribs were better without it.    The service was great, we had a reservation and were seated right on time.  The drinks were great and inventive.   I probably won't return to have a full dinner here, but drinks and the popcorn for sure, maybe a happy hour.",

    "text": "Great place!  I could give it five stars but I definitely have to go with a solid four due to a couple of minor things.  I took my boyfriend here for an early Valentine's Day dinner on Saturday night.  I found it on yelp as I just moved to Phoenix and had no idea where to take him other than the usual Flemings that he loves.  We started with a couple of the recommended drinks. I had the Manhattan, it was definitely good, not the best I have had though.  My bf had the Citi-Zen and it was FAB!  Probably one of the best drinks I have tasted.  We started out with the Chicken and Waffles.  Really good, Almond Butter and Honey was so different but super yummy.  The only complaint was that they gave you one square of Waffle to five pieces of chicken.  We would have been satisfied with two pieces of chicken and maybe just cut the price a little.  Which I wasn't unhappy with the price per se but it just seemed a little off portion size.  I had the scallops which were AMAZING and my bf had the meatloaf.  Which I tasted and it was was really good. I like meatloaf that actually tastes like meat instead of everything else they put into it and that for sure delivered.  We were both really happy with our entrees.  We also had the Black and Tan dessert, which was yummy. But for the life of me I do not understand why we cannot find a restaurant that does caramel pudding the right way. This was by far the best we have ever had out but it still had a grittiness to it.    The only drawback to the restaurant per se is the noise level in there. I felt like at times I was straining to hear my bf talk or I was yelling at him and we both are not old enough to be having those problems lol.      I would definitely recommend this place, maybe not for a romantic dinner but it is for sure one of the best restaurants I have been to in the area!   Thanks fellow yelpers!!",

Maybe it's the service in the dining area, but we weren't allowed to sit there. They made us sit at the bar even though there was a lot of open tables with waiters just standing around. Now the food was pretty bad. The lamb sandwich was ok, but the french fries tasted like they came from the frozen food section. The grilled cheese sandwich was a greasy mess that did not taste good at all. I guess I should have ordered a beer and it would have tasted better, but I just got water and the food was definitely not very good.",

    "text": "This is easily the best new restaurant I have been to in the last year. Extremely good value here - great menu, I had the \"Smart Chicken\" which was out of this world yummy. The Smart Chicken had a wonderful smokiness that permeated with a sweet corn risotto below, smoked onion & shitake mushroom hash & truffle oil. Unbelievable.   The Chef is apparently from the renowned Cowboy Ciao, but I have to say that the food quality and inventiveness here to me surpass Ciao as I always found Ciao trying too hard for the \"Southwesty\" experience which to me felt contrived with too much schtick.   Some of the people in our group had the burgers, which I tasted and were all superb. As others have said, the Chopped Salad is extraordinary with a tangy dressing and just the right amount of fresh ingredients.   I Highly recommend the Fondu appetizer (served over a candle, not sterno as I read in prior reviews). The Fondu came with some sausages and crusty bread and had just the right tangy cheesiness.  Also, the bacon Popcorn appetizer was insane - what a great idea, with small charred bits of fatty bacon drizzled over the white popped morsels.   Even the ketchup for the fries was homemade from scratch!  To me this is the best new spot since NOCA opened - but with better pricing. This is a foodies paradise, and I suggest you get here soon before it becomes the hot ticket that it is surely destined to be. Winner.",

A place with a great vibe.  My first impression was that they are intently focused on service quality. Lots of smiling staff to greet you as you enter. Every employee is attentive to every table. Our server was gregarious, accommodating, gracious, and highly proactive. We definitely felt the 'warm and fuzzy' atmosphere.  They pay attention to the little things -- such as house-made ketchup for your french fries.   The food: about as good as upscale bar food is going to get. For apps we started with the calamari and the crabcakes. Portions weren't large, but very high quality. The calamari was flash-fried and not greasy, and seemed very fresh. For my entree I had the wagyu burger, which was prepared perfectly and served on a fresh challah bun.  Overall impression: Citizen will have staying power, unlike many establishments that open in Old Town. The formula is really pretty simple -- offer high quality stuff, equip the place with great staff, and don't go overboard with prices. I'm looking forward to returning!",

    "text": "At Citizen Public House, my Ty Largo sightings continue. I see that guy damn near everywhere I go, so it must mean Up Agency is handling PR for this place. This has nothing to do with the review.  Citizen is a really cozy, warm, and inviting space, and is exactly the opposite of every other bar in old town. It is grown up, sophisticated, and has a huge emphasis on quality and interesting food. If you're looking for a greasy burger and fries to go with a Coors Light, you've stepped into the wrong place, compadre. If you'd rather go with a bottle of Dogfish Head's Midas Touch to accompany your Original Chop Salad, then Citizen will please your palate much more. A word on the Original Chop Salad, it's the Stetson Chop that you're all accustomed to from Cowboy Ciao. Bernie Kantak, the owner of Citizen created that salad whilst working at Cowboy Ciao, and it's his to take where he wants. Easily the most famous dish in town, in my opinion.   In my observation, Citizen is a douchebag free environment, a sanctuary for those who have become jaded from the usual Old Town bar scene. This would be a great place to have a drink after a night of dining at Marcellino or FnB, not a place to go before you head to Axis Radius or Myst. The white table cloths, dimly lit and somewhat romantic environs, and overal sexiness make this a great spot for a first or second date, or a perfect place to go before heading to the art walk or an event at the Center for Performing Arts.  A couple of small knocks on a place though; they don't have a great selection of draft beers, in fact , I was rather disappointed to see they had Guiness, Bud Light, a couple of Four Peaks, and Pilsner Urquell on draft. They have some really interesting and high quality beers in bottles, but unfortunately the girl behind the bar wasn't terribly experienced with beer and couldn't tell us much about one or two that I was unfamilar with. I consider this a very minor inconvienence and perhaps if business picks up and enough people request it, they will add some good beers to the tap, otherwise, I'd rather drink a bottle of beer at home than in a bar.  All in all, this is a solid contender and I hope it does well. The Old Town scene seems pretty dead to me lately, as on a Tuesday this is one of three places I went where my group was literally the only ones in the house. I'm quite sure the weekend business is better, but you can't survive if you're operating in the red 2-3 nights a week. Here's to hoping Ty Largo does his job and gets the good word out there about Citizen Public House. He owes it to the public to let them experience it.",

The first night, started with the Original Chopped Salad, followed by the Filet Mignon, and finished with Strawberry Poundcake.  Salad was very good with a great pallet of different flavors.  The steak was perfectly cooked and paired with the potatoes and greens was phenomenal.  The poundcake was ok... nothing too special.  The second night, I started again with the Original Chopped Salad, followed by the Wagyu burger.  Once again, the salad satisfied my craving created after I had it the first night.  The wagyu burger was cooked as perfectly as the steak.  The fries were fresh with a slight crisp.  The third time I went was during lunch.  Again, decided to get the Chopped Salad.  Shared the crabcakes with a buddy.  And had the Wagyu burger again.  The salad again was great.  Crabcakes are a bit on rich side for my taste.  The wagyu burger was awesome.  The fries were a bit stale.  All in all, great restaurant and would definitely go back.    Recommend: The Original Chopped Salad, Filet Mignon, and Wagyu burger.",

Old Town's newest treasure has the perfect combination of great location and ambiance, amazing food, a smart beer list and unrivaled cocktails.   After going twice since the opening some of favorites thus far include:  Lagunitas IPA on tap, Pisco Sour, Turley Zin, Tenderbelly Pork Pastrami Belly Pastrami (a must have), Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs, and Tenderbelly Pork Tender Loin.   The staff is friendly, prompt and knowledgeable. Citizen offers a variety of seating options, making it a great neighborhood drop in or perfect setting to impress others on a big night out.",

I have been meaning to write about Citizen's for a month now. I find that it's a breath of fresh air in a field of farts. Old Town had become so....well, old and it leaves a lot to be desired in the way of \"classy joints\". This is a perfect marriage of class and fun; I'd say laid back elegance, if you will.  The interior decor is such a drastic difference from the old Club \"Next\". It's sleek, modern yet comfortable, great bar space and patio and even rooms for private parties. I love the fresh flowers and candles.   I went with a girlfriend of mine and we sat at the bar. We started off with two specialty cocktails. I don't recall the names but one had cucumber and the other had freshly brewed tea in it. They were complex, fresh and most importantly, STRONG. Richie the bar manager took great care of us. He created their drink menu which is accessible but exotic. He is super knowledgeable and friendly. 2 things you need in a bartender. He's easy on the eyes too, so that helps.  For dinner, we shared the pork belly pastrami appetizer, chopped salad and scallops entree. Everything from start to finish was fantastic-you could taste and see Chef Bernie's influence in every dish. Complex flavors yet still had a comfort food feel, which I loved. At the end of the meal, Chef Bernie came out and talked to us. We saw him talking to every table and spending some time with all the guests which is pretty impressive, considering we went within the first two weeks they opened. He is a goddamn genius. Also, easy on the eyes...  At the end of the meal, I went to the bathroom and may have had too much to drink because I dropped my phone in the toilet. Richie offered me his extra cell phone for a few days until I got a new one. Now THAT'S service!   This place is awesome and you can't help but love and support two of the coolest dudes doing some innovative things with food and booze. Go support your local rock stars!",

    "text": "The best beer I've ever had in my life, I just had at Citizen Public House!  Sitting at the massive bar in the center of the restaurant, the bartender was very gracious in offering tasting pours for the unfamiliar selection of microbrews they had on tap.  It was in this manner that I discovered Lagunitas IPA - on draft, and so deliciously hoppy, fruity, and refreshing I am determined to find it back home in Texas!    While sitting at the bar, I had a chance to pore over their menu, which sounded A-MA-ZING.  Each dish was very thoughtfully laid out with amazing-sounding garnishes for each protein.  The prices were appropriate for the high-end cuisine, ranging from $13 for a Waygu burger to $32 for a porcini-dusted filet.  I can't really comment further, since I had dinner reservations down the street and sadly couldn't stay.  The atmosphere was very cool and contemporary, very open.  It is definitely more of a restaurant than a \"pub\".  For a Friday night, it didn't seem that busy, which is a plus if you waited too long to make a reservation anywhere.  This will be my first meal whenever I return to Scottsdale!",

And then we ordered chopped salad, crab cakes for appetizers and chicken, lamb loin for the main course. The chicken was so dry and bland, expected lot more for the money we were paying. The lamb loin was equally bad without seasoning. The crab cakes and the chopped salad were good which kept us from starving I suppose. To top it, the place was noisy making it difficult to have a conversation. I definitely wouldn't go back.",

The service is terrific with everyone having a solid knowledge of what is being served and (my favorite) actually having an opinion they are willing to share with you if you ask.  We started with the imported olives followed by the Burrata. Definitely need to ask for more bread. For entrees we had Pan Seared Scallops and the Gypsy Pork Shank. The Scallops were terrific but the Pork Shank stole the show. Nice large portion, plenty to bring home. We didn't hit dessert menu this time but will dive in the next time we're in.   Great dining experience. Well done!",

I understand dim lighting but it was SUPER dark in the restaurant, little too much for me, but might be fine for others. He ordered the chicken, I ordered the burger. We also had the mac n cheese appetizer.  First, the mac and cheese was good, but it was ruined by putting salsa on top of it? That was a bit strange and wasn't a good mix in my opinion.  Second, his chicken was pretty bland and dry. It was just okay. For the money we were paying for that, we were definitely expecting something with a bigger portion and a lot better tasting! I ordered the burger medium well, it came out rare. I don't mind pink, but that was just too pink. I think he might have misheard me for \"medium rare\" instead of \"well\" which I can TOTALLY see and understand, especially with music playing. Unfortunately gave it back and did not order anything else or another one because it was pretty late and we wanted to go out. The drinks were good, nothing to write home about, but again these were EXPENSIVE.  Probably wont be back, nothing to memorable about this place except the high bill ;). Definitely a nice place, but just not for us.",

Great craft cocktails and nice wine list. I took a friend out after a show; it was a very special occasion and we arrived over an hour before closing time (this is important to note). First off, the hostess was surly, exuding that air of superiority and annoyance of us coming in at 9:48pm-- they closed at ELEVEN that night. She proceeded to seat us in the farthest corner away from the front door, the bar, and all other diners. The table was actually really nice, but I think it contributed to the fact that we were neglected the entire time. It literally took about 3 min to be greeted, let alone get water. 3 minutes is a long time in this type of scenario. I'm not exaggerating. I've been in the service industry for 20 years as a manager, server, etc, and I timed it -- it was that bad. Once the server came over she was nothing but perfunctory, with little to no personality. She made us feel like she couldn't wait to get us in and out. I had planned on spending a lot of money for this dinner (which I still did, considering menu prices but I knew that going in); however, I would have splurged more if I hadn't just wanted to get the experience over with. Won't return anytime soon.",

The tuna was really good 8/10 - slight fishy taste, but hey its Arizona. The sea is far away. The baked peach salad was pretty bad though. The lettuce and bacon was ok, but the peaches were hard as rocks. Its a dish we have all done and if you have peaches a little less than ripe you can usually wing it, but these were solid like a rock. They were most likely very apt for the Summer menu, but as it is Fall, peaches are no longer in season.  We ordered the scallops as our main. I'm a big scalop guy, but these were undercooked and leveled off with a huge pile of greens on top. The photograph of the scallops on yelp showed them with a deep brown sear. Ours were white with a hint of brown and pink in the middle.   I think the best part of the meal was True to scottsdale form, the cocktail. Extra strong which made my girlfriend a little more flirty.   We decided to cut our losses and go to a different restaurant. Frank and Alberts over at the Biltmore. If you want a really good dinner and ambiance you should check this spot out.  The meal came to $80, and we were charged an extra $8 for an extra scalop on the plate which we left behind as a casualty of a bad dining experience.  Moral of the story: if you are into the scottsdale drinking scene bring your date here they serve a strong cocktail, if you are into good food look elsewhere.",

I was debating between this restaurant and Bandera since both have excellent reviews, but I realized there was a Bandera location in Chicago so that helped me make my choice.   Starting with drinks, I've always wanted to try a Moscow Mule, and at Citizen Public House, all of their drinks have a signature mix to them. I HIGHLY recommend it... it was done way before we received any food :)  Now onto the food...   I ordered the Pan Seared Scallops with Roasted Corn Grits - it was one of the BEST meals of my life!!!! I've had scallops numerous of times, but these were the most delicious and delicate I've ever tasted. The corn grits were an incredible addition to the scallops as well... just trust me and get them!  My fiance had the Buttermilk Roasted Chicken - smart Chicken breast, sweet corn-butter bean succotash, roasted Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, pecorino Romano. It's a very popular item and I tried a bit and it was great (not as good as my scallops though). We both practically licked our plates clean... and he's not much of a food lover ;-p  We were stuffed, so no room for dessert, but I WILL be back when I'm in the area again. Our server, who's name I forgot, was excellent and very helpful. The entire night was amazing and definitely the best dinner of our trip to AZ!",

    "text": "The best part about Citizen is the BACON! Seriously, I think they put bacon on everything! Popcorn made with bacon grease and bit of bacon, bacon dessert, bacon drinks....Bacon is the way of life at Citizen and there's nothing wrong with that!  I usually hit up Citizen for Happy Hour after work. They have great prices on snacks & appetizers (we always get the fondue and flatbread), plus the Happy Hour drinks are 1/2 off and some of their specialty drinks are also cheaper. For a great Happy Hour, check it out.  That said, I always said I wanted to go to Citizen for dinner, it's just a bit pricey for a college graduate who's paying off student loan debt. I finally had a chance to be wined and dined at Citizen a few weeks ago for a work event. Man, was I impressed! Going to dinner and having work foot the bill is the best - we went all out!  We started with all of the Happy Hour snacks. Fondue was my favorite (can't go wrong with bread, meat, and melted cheese!) but the bacon popcorn was amazing as well! Again, BACON!  For the main course, I had the scallops. They were perfectly prepared, lightly seared, with veggies and a delicious garlic mashed potato puree. Gah, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Coworkers had the lamb burger (which is to die for, I guess) and the pork chops. Again, looked super delicious - the presentation is amazing!  Dessert was the chocolate mousse thingy. It was decadent and rich, but we definitely ate the whole thing!  For the lower class, dinner is a bit pricey, but for a special night out (or every night, if you're Bill Gates) I highly recommend Citizen! If you can't afford dinner, opt for Happy Hour and you'll get to experience the delight of Citizen.  Side Note - I've also had the mac-n-cheese and it's to die for! It's a great dinner alternative and pairs well with an ice cold beer on tap.",

Salads were great, but endive was quite meager portion size, and tortilla soup while tasty was only lukewarm.   The chicken (these chicks had augmentation lol!) with risotto was fabulous as was the meatloaf.  Those who paid extra for filet did not feel it was any better than ones at chain \"Texas\" restaurants.  Scallops were large, well presented and tasty.  Sides were good and plentiful. Dessert was excellent.  Service was ho-hum.  Those with mixed drinks were offered refills but iced tea and water were not refilled. No one asked if they could get us anything else and some would have ordered coffee to drink with dessert.  To go boxes were provided.  Atmosphere was very noisy, difficult to have a conversation.  Dessert was delicious, but it felt very prepackaged. For the price I expected something very special and this left me wanting more.  Much more.",

The bartenders know their stuff and they use amazing ingredients like the antique formula vermouth (this stuff is $30 a bottle!) and luxardo cherries ($20 a jar).  My test is always to order a mescal drink and let the bartender make up what he/she wants with it.  I've had several of them and they've all been on par with some of the best cocktail places in SF, NY and Chicago.  My only small ding is the prices are high for Scottsdale.  SF has an average of $10 a cocktail at a respectable place... maybe $12.  I've paid $13.50+ at CPH.  Not a huge deal, but you get what you pay for here.",

I have to spend a lot of time in AZ for work and amid the myriad of chain restaurants and mediocre food this place stands out far above the rest.   The Chopped Salad is nothing short of excellent, quite possibly the best salad I've had in my life. Look at my photos. Go, look at them. Do I look like a salad guy? No, I do not. Yet every time I come here I have to get one (once I even got two...yes, I'm a monster). The ingredients, the freshness, how it all works together, it's just excellent. You must get this salad if you come here must. The rest of the menu is solid, albeit not as spectacular. Probably more 3.5 star caliber food, but still very good (espec. for AZ). I've had the Filet (3.5), a panini (3.5), the mac n cheese (not that special), the pastrami appetizer (very good), and scallops (very good). The desserts are also very good, I enjoyed the Peanut butter dessert and flourless choc. cake very much, although the latter is very heavy.   The ambiance and drinks are also excellent, making it a great date spot. Though there are a ton of slutty (sluttily?) dressed women here so keep your eyes on your date.

    "text": "Had been reading all of the Yelp reviews so I knew what I should order. Of course we did the chopped salad and it didn't disappoint. The bone marrow butter and bread- pass... scallops were amazing but for the price there should be at least 2 more, only 3 on the plate for $30.00. Only 1 steak on the menu so we had high expectations- average and the potatoes and tomatoes as a side were blah. Overall service was exceptional, great drinks and entrees that they are known for are great. Need to work on other options and increase serving size of scallops!",

Food seemed to be designed more on how exotic the ingredients sounded instead of how they might actually taste together. \"shredded arugula with capers and a mango habenero mojo\".   Stuff like that.",

My friends and I loved everything we had, and be warned - the cocktails are potent!  I had the salad as my meal (and shared two desserts with my 4 friends), and was comfortable (not too full, but not hungry still).  If you're a big eater, you might want to order something else along with the salad.  But order the damn salad.",

    "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit here. The food was ok, but the drinks made the night and so did our personable and skilled bartender who did an awesome job in serving, teaching, and entertaining us while our party of 3 sat at the bar waiting for our table.    DRINKS: -I ordered the Persian -My friend ordered the  Citi-zen -Her friend ordered the Moscow Mule, which by the way came served to her in a copper mug and a pickle:  the LEGIT WAY to serve any Moscow Mule (shout out to our bartender who informed us of this interesting fact).    My friend's drink was served to her in a martini glass. However, she asked our bartender to pour her drink into an old fashioned glass since she was a klutz when it came to drinking from martini glasses. He willingly obliged but also joked around with the rest of us and asked what drinks we wanted AND what glassware we preferred our drinks in lmao. Needless to say he made our drinks really well and really strong: our drinks were the perfect combination of preserving the integrity of the various flavors while packing a strong punch.  When our table was called we sadly parted ways and what's worse, I completely forgot to ask his name -_-  The rest of my experience here was ok. We were seated in the little room off of the main dining room. I would've preferred to eat at the bar then eat in this small area because it felt closed off from the rest of the restaurant.    FOOD: -I ordered the grilled halloumi cheese sandwich -my friend ordered the kale salad -her friend ordered the \"original chopped salad' which apparently has its own Facebook page (click on the FB link located in the online menu on Citizen Public's website).   My grilled halloumi cheese sandwich was definitely a frou frou version of the classic dish, it was good but it was a bit disappointing only because I didn't know  this type of cheese doesn't melt and I was totally in the mood for some cheesy cheesiness. My least favorite part of my dish was the bread, it was just too thick tough to chew. My friend's kale salad was a complete bust. The kale was completely raw which was ok expect it was hardly dressed so alot of the bitterness was still there. It was also hardly chopped so there were large pieces of raw and bitter kale to eat. The \"original chopped salad; was the best dish out of everyone's. Each ingredient used is arranged in neat rows and presented to you on a plate.  The server then pours the dressing to your liking and proceeds to mix all the colorful ingredients and then serves it to you.   I'd definitely come back just to sit at the bar and try some more of their interesting cocktails; chit chat with the super awesome bartender who assisted us during my 1st visit here; and possibly try another food dish or stick to the chopped salad.",

Enjoyed a Sazarac so smooth I should have bought it breakfast. Piggy & Waffle app made me wonder why the folks in the South stick with chicken... Damn! Roasted chicken and Brussels sprouts was not messing around, though the mantra \"never eat anyone's meatloaf but your mothers's\" was reinforced with a nice attempt, but not a home run. Dessert, drinks, wine, and service were all fantastic. Big recommend.",
