    "text": "My boyfriend and I stopped in here for a quick bite on our way to a late night movie. At 10pm, pretty much everything near here shuts down and stops serving food, including these guys.  It was 10:02 and I must've looked sad and hungry because the bartender was incredibly friendly and checked with the kitchen staff to see if they would make me a salad... they said yes!  So I had the delicious anti-pasta and my boyfriend had a couple slices of their leftover pies.  Leftover slices are only a couple bucks each after 10pm. Oh, and added bonus: late night happy hour gets you $3 off glasses of wine.  Short story long, the food was good and the staff was friendly.  I will definitely keep this place in mind next time I'm in the area and want good food with a smile.",

    "text": "Plus-a-star-to-five-stars update!  Il Capo is just seriously dreamy. The service is great. The food is phenomenal. I'm officially a fangirl for life.  We visited this past Saturday for an early (5:00 I think?) dinner. I had passed out for 2 hours after a HOT and HILLY half marathon (never again) and woke up ravenous. I wanted something to re-fill that calorie deficit. I wanted IL CAPO!  It was hard to decide on something other than pizza, since our first visit's pizza choices were so outstanding. But we explored the rest of the menu (we are so brave) and landed on: happy hour bruschetta (3 pieces for $2.95...delish!), eggplant parm for me, chicken parm for boyfriend. There was not even a crumb or swipe of sauce left on any plates. WIN.  Both our mains were outstanding but we both RAVED and fell in deep, real love with the side of pasta and marinara our dinners came with. Perfectly al dente pasta with homemade sauce topped with parsley and Parmesan...I know it sounds so simple but when it's done so perfectly words escape you, you know? Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. My wine was great. I slept like a bambino that night.  Il Capo, I've said it before, but thanks for being alive!",

Now, the food is delicious and the service is excellent. The kitchen gets the food out fast and cooked perfectly too! The garlic knots never disappoint... They are loaded with garlic!! I've tried many of the pizzas and pastas and have never been disappointed. The pizza is always cooked to perfection and the handmade pastas are just incredible. Handmade pastas are so much better than any pasta you will get at another Italian place! I've had the gelato a few times as well.. Also incredible! Never had something here that I didn't enjoy. Definitely give Il Capo a try. They run a great business and really know how to cook and serve good Italian food!",

    "text": "Looking for a place that would serve up a good fettucini carbonara cause I saw it on the Food Channel and you know how that goes---it gets into your head and you just gotta have it.  So surfing Yelp  for \"fettucini carbonara,\" IL CAPO PIZZERIA  popped up.  Lots of reviews, lots of good ratings.  A few low ones here and there but that happens even to a \"good\" place.  Trusting fellow Yelpers,  I trotted my family to IL CAPO's Scottsdale location on Shea across from the Harkins Theatre and steps away from the now infamous \"Amy's Baking Company\" which was featured on Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares.   We were seated outdoors--perfect --as the evening itself was perfect weather wise.   Menus came promptly and I, of course, didn't really need a menu because I was fixated on getting the fettucini.  Isn't it terrible when you watch food shows and then you either have to cook what you saw or go out for it?  Isn't that psychological manipulation of some sort?  Food has a strong hold on all of us and that fettucini dish was definitely floating in my head.  So guess what I ordered??? Yup.  We also ordered the margarita pizza and a special sandwich.  Why do I call it special?  Because hubby doesn't do anything simple or anything that is on the menu as is.  Here is the special sandwich as he described it to the waiter. \" You know how you have a chicken parmagiana sandwich?  Well I want the chicken with sauce and NO cheese.  You know how you have an eggplant parmagiana sandwich?  Well I want the eggplant on the chicken with NO cheese.  And... could you put Fra Diavolo sauce on it? \" That's the special sandwich.  The waiter wrote everything down and later came back to offer red pepper flakes in lieu of the fra diavolo sauce which they did not carry.  It's nothing more than a spicy marinara sauce.  I'm surprised they don't make it considering so many people are into the hot pepper scene.   The fettucini arrived just as I had dreamed it would.  Cheesy fettucini with pancetta and peas.  Lovely looking dish and lovely tasting.  I added black pepper to it as dishes with parmagiana cheese are complemented by pepper.  I added a dash of salt but that's just me.  I thought it needed it.  The margarita pizza came out as a thin crusted pizza, clearly made in a wood-fired oven as evidenced by the charring on the edges.  A tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella (although not too generous with that) and some basil leaves.  A good pizza, not a great pizza.  Definitely needed more cheese.   And now for the special sandwich.  Hubby noted that the bread was too short for the chicken and eggplant inside it.  On the other hand, one could say that the generosity of the chicken & eggplant dwarfted the bread.  No, let's say the former.  The bread was cut too short for the sandwich.  So like a champ, hubby sucked it up and had less sandwich than he is used to.  He added hot pepper flakes (in lieu of the sauce they didn't have) and he ate his sandwich peacefully.  I noted that there were a few pieces of ziti (or rigatoni) on the plate with the sandwich.  A taste of pasta.  Nice touch.  We cleaned our plates and now time for the check.   The check arrived and as I reviewed it, I saw an item that read, \"OPEN FOOD\".   I queried to those at my table about what OPEN FOOD might be.  Were they charging me for eating outdoors? Did I forget about something I ordered?  I asked Alex, our server, and he clarified OPEN FOOD.  He said the kitchen told him to add $3 for omitting the cheese and putting the eggplant and chicken on one sandwich.  Really? So let me get this straight, IL CAPO charges when you request that an ingredient be left out, such as mozzarella? Note to management:  Doesn't that save you money?   So then we get to the extra slice of eggplant.  Would that be $3?  A bit much if you ask me.  We told Alex we always order this way at other restaurants and there is no up charge.  So a $7.95 sandwich (both chicken parmagiana and eggplant parmagiana pricing)  became a $10.95 sandwich plus tax and tip for omitting mozzarella and adding a slice of eggplant.  So from hubby's perspective he would rather go to his old Italian standby  that makes this sandwich with a smile and with no up- charge.  Wouldn't you?",

The pizza is the best in Scottsdale for sure maybe in Phoenix (but I haven't eaten in all of them) but il Capo is so good. The margarita I got didn't have enough mozzarella on in but the crust was so good I went back and it was amazing. I think it was late and they had run out. Service was good and the prices are very reasonable. I would put it up to any pizza place and it would come out on top. Keep up the standards and you will really shine. One of the best pizza joints I have ever eaten at and I have eaten them in NY and all over LA one of the best I ever had. 5 star Pizza. !!!!!!! A must go to for some quality wood burned pizza.",

After an hour and 20 minutes we called and they said they sent 5 deliveries in one car and that we (the customer) are the problem.   The food never ended up getting delivered because the owner felt that we wouldn't want it after all that time.  I went to the restaurant to speak with the owner to find out what actually happened.  Who ever took the order wasn't paying attention, didn't know how to spell, didn't know to ask for a customer to clarify an address or ask for a phone number that the customer could be reached at.    I have no idea how the food actually is, but was given the 12\" pizza on my way out with parting word to \"not order the 12\" thin crust to go because they just don't hold up well for travel\".  Makes me wonder why they gave it to me it they really aren't proud of it.  Had the restaurant been up front and honest with timing (and actually told us if a pizza wouldn't be good delivered) maybe we would have had a chance to try it.",

It was my first time at il Capo, and every time I go to Pita Jungle I think..\"I need to try that place\"  I thought it was good, I got a calzone with meatballs, wife got a slice of the white pizza and pear/argula salad.  The calzone was HUGE, I took half home for a snack. It was loaded with cheese, melty and delicious, though there wasn't any marinara in it so I asked for a side of it, and it became perfect. I liked the sauce a lot.   Service was great, attentive, and my drink was always filled, bathroom was clean..  I will def be back to try a pie. If you want pizza in this shopping area, do not even CONSIDER going to kitchen nightmare ABC - come to il Capo, much better",

We started with the meatballs which were totally on point! The sauce was some of the best I've ever had. Next we each had a slice of their meat lovers pizza, which had some of the best crust I've had on a pizza in AZ. This was also complimented by that amazing marinara sauce. I then ventured into a stromboli full of meat and cheese and baked with a flaky crust rolled in sesame seeds. This was my favorite item of the night!  We finished with the dark chocolate gelato. Very tasty. I highly recommend this place. Food service and ambience are best in the Scottsdale/shea restaurant area.",

Let it be perfectly clear, it was meant for il Capo and it is correctly posted and the lousy dining experience is accurately stated!!! The original post was done about a month ago.  Zero stars would be more accurate but not a choice. We were 2 couples. Took 45 for the pizza to come out. 10 minutes later the salad came out and had to be sent back as it was just lettuce on the Cobb salad. They forgot all the ingredients that make it a Cobb. The replacement came with an apologetic waitress. Our friends finished their pizza and replacement Cobb. We enjoyed watching them eat but still didn't receive our dinners. We sat another 30 minutes after they finished eating before they brought my wife and my dinners. Mario, the manager/owner?? came out and was very rude to us and the folks at the next table. Never apologized but just made excuses. He blamed the waitress for putting in too many orders! That's what waitresses do, they take an order and put it in. The people at the next table never even got their food and neither did another table. They complained and just left after this Mario rudely told them to get out and never come back! See the review by Angie B. below. They were the group that walked out! With all the great Italian restaurants in Scottsdale, I will be sure to avoid this one in the future. Suggest you do the same.  On a positive note, our waitress was great as she kept my water glass full.",

    "text": "Oops...!  OK, our first meal @ il Capo was just fine, my daughter & wife had pizza and a salad = fairly good.  I had an antipasto that I was told was made for two. Quite excellent except for sparsity of salami = 2 thin slices & 1 slice of prosciutto.  A few nice olives and fresh but, not enough lettuce & greens.  Honestly, we looked forward to going back.  And tonight, we did.  \"Oops\" is perhaps the most gentile I can be.  Tuesday night problems when not crowded?  Hmm...!  I ordered the PAPPARDALLE BISTECCA, described as: Ribbon Pasta, Sliced Beef, Mushrooms, Onions & Red Peppers In Tomato Sauce and I ordered it with extra mushrooms + sausage.  The dish arrived piping hot with NO mushrooms {even though it's a main ingredient as described} 1 tiny-tiny slice of a corner of a mushroom... so much for extra mushrooms, huh?  There was a hind of a diced onion - actually 3 hints, each about 3mm by 2mm and maybe 1mm thick?  Oops?  The sausage was quite excellent, as was the pasta.  BUT, what happens when you order a main ingredient as extra and you need a magnifying glass and tweezers to find any traces?  Oh well.  My daughter ordered a Buffalo Chicken pizza slice and she got it - even though it must have been made a week or so ago.  She couldn't bite through or slice through it with a knife.  Kind of like old door-mat?  Heavens, the waiter was so prompt in replacing it - but, why serve it in the first place if not fresh?  OK, she then ordered a chicken parm hero which arrived after the rest of us had finished eating.  My wife had an eggplant parm hero.  She said it was OK {nothing fabulous kind of OK}   A $50+ meal for 3 with no drinks or deserts ought to be a good bit better, or, even as described?  Heaven knows there's tons of competition in Scottsdale for really good pizza & pasta.  Tonight, I guarantee almost anywhere else would have been better with delayed, cooled, take-out.  BUT, they took my money all-righty!  So, for a place that boasts quite the NY-Style Italian Pizza & Pasta, I have to say: \"Nah... nada, nope!\"  When the food is fresh, it is fairly nice.  When it's not, or not as ordered or not as described in the menu... then what?  You decide.  And yes, I'm a NY guy who knows where most of the great Italian joints are in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, Nassau & Suffolk, Southern CT, etc.  I'll admit I've not driven to Staten Island often for dining out = just a bit too far away.  If you like small or moderate size salads...?  They're great {just by no means abundant portions}  Be sure to check your orders when they arrive - not fun to have to say or write.  It'll probably be a good while before we dare to try il Capo again - BUT, we will since we live nearby.  I'd love to give il Capo 5-stars but, I can't even get half way there. Duh!",

These bad boys were flavorful, savory, and amazing. Overall Review: 9.8/10  Caesar Salad. AAHHH!!! This salad was so good! One of the best Caesar Salads I've ever had in my life. Crisp and creamy to the max. Overall Review: 9.9/10  Ribs. Never heard of an Italian restaurant serving this before, but who cares? Not dry at all, super sweet & savory at the same time. Simply delicious. Overall Review: 9.7/10  I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant. Overall Recommendation: 99.2%",

Downside - if you live here, you know it's a busy, crowded center and it's hard to find parking. Luckily there's a few spaces around back for pickup, and hopefully that's respected. Will come back for an eat in. Hope we find a parking space.  Came in twice in two weeks between films at the Jewish Film Festival. Interesting $5 Happy Hour beers and small.pizzas. This time it was eggplant and red peppers. Just perfect and thanks for getting us out in time.",

    "text": "Interesting place - they do woodfired and NY style pizza.  Read about this place in the magazines that come in the mail selling you home upgrades (moveable patio shade louver thingies, etc.) - sounded like it was worth checking out.  Split the lunch special Woodfired pizza and salad special with a friend. We ordered the meatball pizza, and got a Caesar and a mixed green salad. My friend said the Caesar was good.  The mixed green salad was attractive and a nice mix of greens, but the dressing was overly plentiful and kind of heavy (and left me with an aftertaste that, for whatever reason, reminded me of ravioli after each bite - must be something in the dressing that's commonly in ravioli?)  The pizza came out - crust was nicely charred, but kind of thick (and thus, a bit doughy). Meatballs were decent, but the sauce was meh.  BIG space, so they must get a big dinner crowd.  Haven't tried the NY style, but I think they're facing serious competition in both categories just across the main streets - woodfired to the west, and NY to the south.",

The slices of pizza were looking a bit lame though at that time of day, so I opted for a seat and table service. They have an all day Happy Hour menu and a free order of four knots for yelp check-in. I did enjoy the knots which were drenched in garlic and had a great marinara sauce for dipping. The main course was the $8.95 eggplant parmesan hero and this was clearly done NY style. The cutlets were nicely breaded and had a good amount of mozzarella cheese and that french bread was really good bread. There was a guy with a Yankees cap cooking in the back, so I knew I was among friends and people who can cook this kind of food properly....on this day at least.",

First decided to come here after finding out I could get some tasty looking garlic knots for free thanks to yelp.  This would be a good place to take a date I think! Not too loud, nice atmosphere, and good quality food and a good portion for a reasonable price. There weren't a ton of people when we went, a good amount of people, but not crowded. No wait or anything. Service was really fast! The garlic knots were amazing. Perfect amount of garlic and the bread had a crispy outside but soft buttery inside. I had a ridiculously hard time deciding which pizza to get because there were a lot of great sounding meat-free options. The one with fried eggplant on it sounded unique and I want to try it sometime, when my appetite is larger haha. Also the pesto margherita, I wish I would've ordered that because j wasn't as into my pizza as I wanted to be. I got the Vegetariano and I think there were just too many different vegetables on there for my liking. Like it was good! Veggies were fresh! It was just too much. My friend got the regular margherita pizza and she loved it, we traded a slice and I liked hers more than mine haha. We both ate everything but didn't feel nasty because the pizza was light and not real greasy or anything. Halfway through my friend commented \"we have to come back again!\", and I have to agree!",

    "text": "I regularly travel and spend my time at a variety of eateries. With the addition of il capo I regard this as one the most refreshing Italian restaurants I have ever been to. The waiters/waitresses come often to check on your needs but not to the point where you feel suffocated and unable to enjoy the food. All of the employees know the menu inside out and have great recommendation for any specific set of dietary/filling requirements needed for your entree. The food takes about 10-20 minutes to come out for each entree and 5 minutes for appetizers. The garlic knots provide are some of the freshest \"garlic bread\" types that I have ever tasted. Their texture and heat combines with the spices and marinara sauce are fascinatingly delectable. Any of the entrees that come with spaghetti/linguini/macaroni served with any of the meats is spectacular and fills you up to your needs. The plates come out hot and cooked to perfection. However, I on occasion enjoy staying to eat for 2 hours with desert. Il capo provided me with some of the best cheesecake in addition to an extravagant assortment of other desserts that I could pick from, which you could also get with tea. After leaving this restaurant I couldn't stop laughing as I had just spent one of the best nights with all of my friends in a long time.",

When the server finally came, we ordered a bottle of wine, 50% off on Wednesdays. Server returned with bottle; no opener. Returned awhile later -- quite awhile -- with opener. Food arrived. Dropped knife. \"May we have another knife?\" We asked him.  \"Sure. Right away.\"  Another relative term. Finally, I got up, went inside to busboy and returned with knife. Then: \"Could we get two plates for our pizza?\"  Again, it'd be \"right away.\"  And again, after a considerable wait, I went inside, retrieved plates from busboy. Same story with the box for remaining pizza. Same story when we asked for the check. And -- the restaurant wasn't even busy. A few diners, like us, outside; only three or four tables inside were filled. But, the pita place next door was packed. There's a message for management in there somewhere, yes?",

Our waitress was in a bad mood the entire time she served us and forgot to bring our drinks 3...yes I said three times! I was brought the wrong salad by a guy who almost threw the plate on our table and didn't even say anything and then basically ran away to another table. At least say something to me, don't just drop food on my table. When our waitress came over to tell me that I was brought the wrong salad, she didn't say sorry or have any apology at all, she just said \"he brought you the wrong salad.....um......\" so I asked her to bring me the salad I ordered (the roasted beet salad...very good, however I liked the first salad better...it has spiced pears, heirloom tomatoes and pecans). If I go back I'd maybe sit outside or take it to go...but not eat inside again.",

I was already sure what I was going to have but since I had some questions on some items on the menu I had not heard of but they sounded interesting. Our waiter made suggestions and I took everyone. I was not let down. Started with beers and some great wine, garlic knots and Orincetti-rice balls. Both were fantastic-the sauces were amazing!! Our waiter continued to make sure our glasses were full and checking to make sure we enjoyed our appetizers. We got 2 pies... Funghi and Diavlo.. again referral by the chef and the waiter. Both a slice of heaven! Both had such great flavor. I enjoyed the Funghi because I loved all the garlic and my friends loved the Diavlo because of the hot sausage. We all agreed we would get again.. but not until after we tried others; they have to all be just as good! Unfortunately, we were all to full to get dessert. At the end of the evening our bill was a pleasant surprise! Not any different from the 4 of us going to any other restaurant, but the quality of the meal was way better so we feel we got our moneys worth and some. I highly suggest this place and am sure you will all enjoy",

Then, one weekend night, we decided to order delivery for the first time. My boyfriend ordered a pepperoni, bacon, and garlic calzone. We received a SALAMI, bacon, and garlic calzone.  We called the restaurant to let them know and after explaining over 10 times what we thought was a simple mistake, they finally said they would remake the calzone. Not five minutes later, the manager calls my cell phone and starts arguing with me!! Telling me I am wrong and that the salami isn't in the pizza station so there was no way there could be salami in the calzone, as I'm standing there looking at and tasting the salami right in front of me. I'm in shock as to how a manager of such a nice establishment would ever think it was okay, in any way, to sit and argue with a customer. After first making this our weekend date spot, we will no longer be returning our business to such a place. Two thumbs down.",

I loved the menu and planned to make this my new regular restaurant. They even offer gluten free pasta (spaghetti). Then I ate there and my plans changed.   Starting with the wine list- they should scrape it and start over. This is Scottsdale and people here expect sonething drinkable. They were not even that cheap- $8-12. The best I can sayfor the Montepulciano is that it was tasteless. I sent one back- the first time in my life I ever sent back a wine. I ordered the Malbec that they recommended.  Cheap crap All Malbecs are inexpnsive- why not buy a better one? Anyway I left it there, untouched.   Food- I wanted to love this restaurant because they offer orecchiette with broccolini and sausage. This happens to be my favorite Italian dish but no Scottsdale restaurants carry it. The orecchiette are hand made here- about 18-1/4 inch think pasta- just think about that. I took a picture- they are the size and shape and consistency of a babies' ear. A good choice for Halloween but a disappointment the rest of the year. I had to send them back because they were big, fat, and cold.  My husband had a nice sized portion of lasagne. Also cold. reheated frozen food but they didn't heat it up enough. Better afterwe sent it back and they nuked it. It has a nice flavored sauce.   So- bad wine, cold food,   So much for them becoming my weekly special place. But I'll try them again in about 6 months and see if they hired someone who knows Italian food/ and or/ how to cook.  I love the location.",

The sauce had very little flavor, it needed some garlic, basil, oregano, salt & pepper.   Salad was pretty mediocre with very little parmesan. And the spaghetti & meatballs was most disappointing.  My son said the meatballs were like mystery meat.  He didn't finish, which is not something he ever does, usually wants seconds & thirds. The waiter seemed like he was 12 & had no knowledge of the menu whatsoever. He described a dessert that came out totally different.  We asked for chocolate cake, he brought us brownies with pistachio ice cream. I will try it again, just because it is close & I can't eat at Pita Jungle more than once or twice a week.

A delicious selection of ingredients to choose from, thinner crust, perfect sauce and aged cheese. Plus, with a drizzle of olive oil, perfection. The large 18\" is perfect for two or three, especially if you want some to take home. We usually split their Caesar salad, which is never over dressed, with perfect dressing, and, they split it in the kitchen, always a nice touch. They have a complete Italian menu, not just pizza ( which is also available by the slice). A full bar is also available. We have never gotten to desert, being too full, but, maybe next time. They have a large outside patio, too. Now to the staff and owners. What a friendly, professional group. You really feel welcome...A definite winner here!",

This is subjective as I really liked the sauce.  Daughter had the linguine with clams and wolfed it down.  On a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the best thing she has ever eaten, she gave it a 3.5.  She has eaten at some very fine places so this is actually pretty high praise.  My son had the gnocci with marinara and loved it.  He's less discerning but really loved it.  As usual, I had their pizza and thought it was great.  The non-pizza dishes were a little pricey and both of the kids wanted more but overall, a really good experience.  We'll return.",

Instead of apologizing for the delay or explaining why there was a hold up in the kitchen, he told us that if we didn't like the service he provided then we should leave and never come back to his restaurant. He also said he has plenty of money so he doesn't need our service. The most unprofessional owner of a business I have ever encountered.",

She was super nice and professional.  She suggested the special of the day, a fettuccini with shrimp and veggies in a light wine sauce, it was delicious.  I was so hungry I forgot to take a picture.  My husband had a Hippy Roll, which is a smaller size calzone.  Another time we went for a late lunch and we had a eggplant parmesan hero and the shrimp scampi pappardelle.  Everything has been great.  Can't wait to come back for some more.  One of this days I will be hungry enough to get a calzone, they are huge.",

Their kitchen boasts both a Neapolitan style wood fire grill and two New York pizza ovens. Nice!  On our visit last night we tried a Margherita pizza (photo) which was very good.   Prices were reasonable and their Happy Hour has most of their beers on tap for $1.00 off a pint. The two San Tan Hefe's were cold and hit the spot (photo). Their wine list is also very good. We enjoyed a California Pinot that tasted a lot better than the $8.00 a glass price.   We started off with a two Meatball appetizer ($7.95) and a very flavorful Chopped Arugula Salad ($6.95). The salad was mixed with Basil (always a plus) which gave a very mild taste and had some feta cheese. We shared the aforementioned tri-color Queen Margherita and thought it was almost as good as any we have enjoyed in those certified Neapolitan places.   The bill came to a very reasonable $42.33 including taxes, but before gratuities. We sat inside and enjoyed some hockey on two TVs while waiting for our food. The atmosphere is friendly, inviting and fun.   Enjoy!",

First a smiley bartender that was very welcoming and a beautifully decorated bar.  So far so good!  Tried their house wine which was really good and had two slices of their pizza (available either whole pie or by the slice).  First was the plain cheese pizza.  One thing I'm very particular about is the sauce.  It was to have a rich tomato taste that doesn't taste out of a can, with a bit of seasoning.  By far one of the best sauces I've tasted in the valley.  Cheese was quality and thin crust perfectly cooked.  Next was their meat/pepper slice.  Whoa did that pack a bit of heat.  Not to the point of overwhelming the pizza but had a nice kick to it.  Italian sausage was good as well (not sure if it was homemade and forgot to ask).  So of course I had to have the gelato dessert after it was described to me as \"heavenly\".  Tried the sea salt caramel that turned out to be unbelievable- I mean delicious, creamy and tasty unbelievable.  Had some other unique flavors that are next on my list to try.  Great food, service and pizza for sure!!!!",

All too many pizzerias add tons of sugar and salt to their recipe which ruines any chance of making a quality product. This was propper hand-tossed dough with just the right ingredients. Il Capo makes their own fresh mozzarella in house, and their side salads are made with fresh romain lettuce; none of that wilted-pre-chopped iceberg lettuce from a bag. Just in case I have not mentioned the word \"fresh\" enough, then I say again everything on their menu is FRESH! This has just made my list of repeat localls!",

Do I order sauce that's not my moms? Went ahead and ordered the gnocci. Was so full but could not stop eating, until my plate was clean. Sampled my friend's ravioli, and debated who made the better choice.  Light, fluffy, and cooked to perfection.  The pizza could have been straight out of New York City. Or Italy.  After 18 hours of driving, left Il Capo with a full stomach and a smile on my face. Would recommend to anyone passing through looking for a delicious meal!",

I can go back to work without food coma. If you're ravenous and have a friend with you, they have another special with a full pizza and two salads. It's more than enough for two. For a refreshing drink try their Bubblinos. It's a made with Prosecco sparkling white wine infused with fruit juice. It's light and refreshing and you won't get wasted. They make it in several flavors, I like pineapple. When the weather is nice, there's a big patio in front covered with awnings so you won't be blasted by the sun. The inside decor is \"molto bene!\" I hope that's Italian for very good? Service is always quick and the staff goes the extra mile.",

The salad comes on it's separate plate and the pizza is a big, generous slice.   Both were very good. I loved the crust of the pizza. Nice and chewy. Baked in one of those big, wood pizza ovens. Excellent on the first day, fresh out of the oven. Forget your carb count & just eat it all cause it will not be hard & not tasty at all the next day.   Why 4 stars and not 5?  Our waitress seemed a bit surly. It seemed like she was the only one serving in the whole restaurant so she was needed everywhere at once. I didn't mind it too much since I know how that can be from my college days working as a server myself.   Check in and you get an order of garlic knots which are pipping hot and garlicky delicious!   I would come here again, the salad and pizza are good!",

Like, really garlicky which is perfect for me. We split the Italian sausage pizza and a salad - can't remember which- but it was very good. The oven is one of those big 900 degree heat ovens with the tiny tiles all around it. I have seen one just like it at another pizza parlor and they had flown it in from Italy, and wonder if they did the same here; shoulda asked. That being said, every pizza gets a different \"doneness\", with some more crispy and brown than others. Ours turned out good. The server was wonderful and attentive and very friendly.",

My question was answered when I finally decided to visit for a pizza. They have free knots when you check in so I decided to try them. Our waiter forgot them and they never arrived! Not sure if they do that on purpose to get you in but that was a little disappointing. We ordered an 18\" pizza and added ricotta. They charge $2.00 for ricotta? It's a little pricy, wouldn't mind if they put enough on the pizza. It took too long for the pizza to come out and that's not the worst part. Both waiters had major sniffles and kept wiping their noses with their hands and fingers and never washed their hands! I was completely grossed out and never touched my water because of the lemons he handled. Not sure I will ever return. Overall the pizza tasted ok - good, not the best but that could be due to the fact that I was super grossed out by everything else.",

It has a vivid blend of oregano, basil and other wonderful Italian flavors on a thick, yet crispy-bottom crust. It's the slice, pictured below, with the rectangular cut. I also tried the traditional (regular crust) pepperoni pizza which was baked perfectly in their wood fired pizza oven.  The atmosphere is casual, with a hip feel to the bar. See the photo of the curved metal ceiling.   The staff was warm and wonderful. We had stopped in after a late movie. (il Capo is located right across the parking lot from the Harkins Shea 14 movie theatre.) We didn't know that il Capo was closing, and yet the charming Italian waiter welcomed us with no hesitation, convincing us to stay for as long we wanted. My mother and I chatted for quite a while as we had Peroni and pizza, and the waiter insisted that we \"take our time and enjoy: they were just cleaning anyway.\" When we left, feeling guilty that we had stayed so long, we saw a couple go in, and they were welcomed just as warmly!  'Love il Capo. I'm returning this week for lunch, before a movie, with a friend.",

I was frustrated (again) that Nero d'avola wine is on the list but not available.  After more than a year I should know my favorite wine is not available.  Still, why not take it off the list?  Service wasn't as attentive as before.  There were two singles and us but the server had little interest in us. Once we got the pizza I had to ask for chili pepper flakes and Parmesan and he didn't know where they were.  After our order, it took the cook at least ten minutes to come out of the back then make our pizza.  We weren't pressed for time but still...  I guess in the summer heat everyone is less motivated.  Wine was fairly priced and pizza dough, sauce, cheese were good.  We might be back but were disappointed after several good experiences.",

However, the arugula already was turning yellow. But, I was happy they had organic and the salad dressing was amazing; slightly sweet tasting.  For main entree, we had Orecchiette (elbow pasta) and Pasta Diavola (angel hair). Both were delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly 'al dente'. Both dishes were slightly on the salty side; but otherwise, very good.  The waitress recommended State 48 Blood Orange beer and it was really good as well.

Pizza was burnt and was very bland.  Pitchers of beer hold two glasses so not really 40oz. as advertised as they fill two pints to about a inch below the glasses.  Overall, none of our group will probably return, at least I won't.  Wasn't terrible but would not really recommend.",

    "text": "I would give 0 stars if possible.  I've been to this restaurant twice, and the most recent time was literally the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant.  My girlfriend and I sit down, order an appetizer and a sausage pizza.  About 15 minutes later, our pizza was delivered mistakenly to another table a few feet away from us.  As we watch the couple touching the pizza, then taking slices from it and putting it on their plates, their server realizes that they dropped the wrong pizza and takes it back to the kitchen.  OUR server then lets us know that there was a mix up and that our pizza would be out shortly.  Unfortunately, we were watching the whole time as the other server takes back our original pizza to the kitchen (which is 5 feet away from our table and in plain view), reconfigures the slices to make it look fresh, and brings back said pizza to our table, pretending as if it were a new pizza! Not only have my girlfriend and I both worked at numerous restaurants in our lives, anyone can agree that this is COMPLETELY unacceptable, not to mention very unsanitary.  However, it gets worse.  We calmly tell the server that we saw what they did and would like a new pizza, to which they comply.  A few minutes later as our new pizza is in the oven, we ask to speak to a manager.  So the manager (who also happened to be helping the server put the old pizza back on the tray and reconfigure it) comes over, and I explain to him calmly everything that happened.  I also explained to him that obviously we should not have to pay for the pizza (common sense).  At this point the manager says, \"You were 100% right up until you started demanding things for free, so therefore the door is right there!\"   I am honestly at a loss for words at not only how this restaurant chooses to do business and recycle food, but also how poorly we were treated by the \"manager\".  If these are the types of things they do in plain sight, with the kitchen just a few feet away from the dining room, one can only wonder what types of things go on that the guests don't see.    I would definitely NOT recommend this restaurant, unless you enjoy getting recycled food and then being told to leave by management after making a complaint.",

    "text": "Our family of four dined in at il Capo on a Friday night. It took just a bit to get seated at a patio table because we had to wait for the hostess to seat us.  She was busy helping another customer with her check or something.  There is lots of staff so I'm not quite sure why someone else couldn't have seated us at an open table.  We all asked for water and all of us were in agreement that the water does not have a good taste.  It seems odd that a restaurant would serve water that tastes like it is unfiltered and out of the tap.  Especially in hot Arizona, please serve some water that doesn't taste awful.  Hopefully this isn't their way to force customers to order other beverages.  Our food was a mixed bag.  Garlic knots were good, but possibly a bit overcooked on the bottom.  We had to ask for napkins and ended up taking silverware off an open table by us since our table had none.  Our son ordered the pesto salmon and liked the fish, but disliked the risotto that came with it.  Two others at our table tasted his risotto and agreed it was not very good.  Our daughter had gnocchi Bolognese and thought it was okay.  She tasted my penne alla vodka and said it was better than her dish.  Personally I'd give the penne dish a 6 and would have to say I like a similar pasta dish at Oregano's much better.  My husband had the capricciosa pizza.  He liked it.  I had a taste of his pizza and would agree it was pretty good.  Our two kids ordered dessert: one raspberry gelato and the tiramisu.  Both enjoyed the desserts.  In a nutshell, we were generally disappointed that the service and the food wasn't better.  The staff just seemed to be a bit disorganized.  We all agreed that if we returned we'd stick to side salads and pizza; the fish and pasta entrees were disappointing, especially given the prices we paid.",

They have a good variety in the menu so I'll likely be back at least one more time to test some more of the options. Staff were friendly and seating area was clean, bathroom was ready for a good cleaning but not disgusting. It's a one person at a time so it could be a wait if you need to use it.

    "text": "il Capo (The Boss) finally does what the entire Valley Of The Sun has failed to do for the past 12 years I've lived here....make a kick-ass pizza!  The owner is from New York and he knows NY pie top to bottom.  Crust is perfect, the blend of cheeses are right on the money, no skimping on poor quality pepperoni, and best of all the sauce is the without equal.  When you bite into a slice you don't taste crust, sauce, cheese and toppings, you taste a whole, perfectly put together pizza!    We ordered the 18\" NY pie and between my friend and I we took the whole thing down.  Been back 3 times in the past 2 weeks already.  Mary Ann is our afternoon/lunch server and she makes us feel like veteran patrons of the place.  There won't be any shaving off stars for the environment because it is very pleasant.  Clean, quiet and laid out nicely so as not to feel too crowded or cramped.  Personally I'd change the decor up to a nice 70's pizza parlor style with wood paneling, red plastic pizza cups, pinball machines and carpeting.  Maybe even a raised area where you could put a band on Friday and Saturday nights.  If not then I'd settle for a jukebox, but the music could only go up to 1981...'83 tops.  To me il Capo should rename themselves The Boss because that's what they are.  I'll be there every week until I can't eat anymore or if for some reason they decide to try to keep up with the ridiculous trends of specialty pizza's with dumb sauces like fire roasted tomatoes or a \"white\" sauce.  Long live il Capo!",

So, I visited again in the following weekends, pre- or post-movie and ordered pasta meals rather than just appies. Gnocchi was the first I had, as that's my fav pasta - theirs didn't disappoint me. The texture was perfect - not gloppy and the sauce was nice and rich. Next I tried the spaghetti and meatballs - loved it. I actually ate the entire plateful, which is a rarity because I never finish my entire meal. So, the food is really good, and as I said, I really appreciated never really feeling like I was dining alone, thanks to the personal attention of the staff. And, I finally tried their pizza, which they're known for, but oddly, I'd not tried despite becoming a regular. They serve NY style slices, and although I'm not from NY to know the authenticity, I love their pizza. But, truth be told, their Stromboli is my all-time favorite there. It's ridiculously good - I highly recommend it. I also have sat on their patio with my dog (I've a 9 lb dog), which they happily accommodated, however I'm not sure what the policy would be for larger dogs, as mine remained on my lap the entire time I ate. But it was really nice to be able to bring my little one and enjoy a glass of wine at the same time. I really feel at home at Il Capo, as it's become my neighborhood eatery. Anyway, with regards to the pizza slices, after a certain time later in the evening they sometimes offer a buy one get one, so call and ask for details on that. Also, they have great specials. I highly recommend Il Capo!",

    "text": "I would give this place 4 stars but the extra star goes to the delivery man. Don't get me wrong, the food here is delicious! We ordered the Chicken Parm, Penne Alla Vodka, Beef Lasagna & the Crispy Ribs. The flavour was unbelievable, the presentation (even though they came in delivery containers) was very appealing , & the time it took to get from their location to ours. We placed our order & the gentleman on the phone was very pleasant. We paid with a credit card & waited the 45-55mins. 50mins later, I received a phone call from the restaurant stating that they do not deliver to our area as it is out of their delivery radius. I asked if the food was done & he said yes: we can either pick it up or cancel our order & they would reimburse our card. All of a sudden I could hear someone in the background saying \"they placed their order how long ago & are still waiting for it. I would be bummed.\" The man on the phone said that the delivery guy was persistent on delivering our food & that to keep in mind for next time that they will not deliver to our area. I tipped the delivery guy a very generous amount & apologized that we did not know how far out they delivered to. He smiled & said \"don't be sorry, it wasn't right that you patiently waited for your food & than told after the fact that we don't deliver as far as here.\"  Not sure if this is a Yelp feature or not & maybe I don't know how to fully embrace the Yelp world, but if a restaurant has boundaries that they don't deliver outside of, maybe they should map that for the users.",

    "text": "I would like to start off by saying I was somewhat irritated by my experience here but at the end of the day it is still a restaurant worth trying because the food is really good.  My boyfriend and I went here yesterday and we were on somewhat of a time crunch because we were going to catch a movie after.  We were seated quickly, put in our orders quickly, and our meals came out in a timely manner.  However, the problem I have is with their check in offer.  Our waitress had no idea how to help us redeem the check in offer for free garlic knots and when she went to ask someone that would know, they instructed her to tell us that we'd take care of the check in offer at the end.  As we were halfway through our meals, we reminded our waitress that we still needed the garlic knots and I was holding back on eating my pasta because I like to dip garlic bread/knots in the bolognese sauce. Our waitress had to take my phone to figure it out and was running around with my phone for a good amount of time until the manager or owner (not sure who it actually was) helped her figure it out.  Because of this, our waitress did not put the garlic knots order in for the kitchen to make until we were almost completely finished with our entrees.  I understand that the knots were free so I shouldn't be complaining but at the same time it made for an irritating experience and we barely made it to our movie in time.  Why would you offer a check in offer if you are not going to train your servers how to redeem it for the customers?  Overall, food was good and I would recommend it for someone to try because it could end up being your new favorite restaurant but I personally will not come here again.",

My only complaint is that they charge for their garlic knots. And they are expensive, and/or they don't even give you bread with the meal. Yes, who needs bread? That's not the point. We still live in America and are allowed to make our own food choices. So if I order a $15 meal, I should get complimentary good bread or garlic knots. It's just how I see it.  So since the kids like garlic knots, sometimes I have to take them to NYPD since they are more generous with their knots! You can go to other restaurants get the same quality food, and they give you a salad and bread with the meal. So I don't know what the owner is thinking. Probably profit margin.",

It tasted like pizza I've only been able to enjoy in Italy. Worth the trip to eat in so you can too enjoy authentic and incredibly good pizza!  We also got the roasted pear salad which was fantastic.

Their wine list was rather extensive & the chianti I had was above average (my wife had captain & coke, so...).  The bruschetta was good with the bread being soft to chew but firm enough to hold the ingredients.    The ribs were delicious!  The sauce was sweet but not sugary, with hint of dark chocolate (perhaps?) with the meat falling off the bone.  I'll go back just for those ribs.  The pizza was thin crust but not crispy and the toppings (mushrooms & sausage) were fresh.  But the key to any good pie is the cheese & sauce.  The sauce was excellent with the real star being the cheese.  This is very good pizza.  We will return.  Go. Eat. Drink. Enjoy.",

Though it's right next to them, I am disappointed in myself for not knowing anything about il Capo Pizzeria until yesterday!  Last night, I went with a group of three others to grab a last minute dinner at ip Capo Pizzeria in Scottsdale.  The restaurant has a friendly atmosphere with some inside and outside seating.    Not knowing what to expect, we decided to split two pizzas, but I learned much more about the place than just how tasty their pizzas are.  Two of us decided to order a 12\" pizza while the other two of us ordered a larger 18\" pizza.  We didn't know how filling one 12\" pizza was.  It turned out that it was a perfect size and the 18\" pizza lead to some leftovers, which I am sure will be great!  Between the pizzas and some garlic knots, we were pretty much filled up.  They apparently have some great dessert options that I wish we had room for including Smores in a Boat, Cannoli Laboratory, Apple Pizza Pie, and several gelato options.  Check out the menu at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Filcapoaz.com&s=d755753f7ddc38ae017ac5c216193eb61bc23d484f7f5dedd8c7688837b7ddb7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ilcapoaz.com</a>.    There are also some great deals out there!  First, if you check-in on Yelp, there is a check-in offer of a free order of delicious garlic knots.  Happy hour is daily from 2-6 PM with special prices for a variety of appetizers and even special priced 12\" pizzas.  There is also a reverse happy hour from 9 PM to close Wednesday through Saturday where you can get 2 slices for the price of 1.  Now I know to spread out the courses and be okay taking some food home.  I look forward to my next adventure to il Capo!",

The veggies were so fresh and the sauce was just the right amount of tang, crust was not saturated with cheese grease like other delivered pizza. I was satisfied and happy that trying this new place was a success. For some reason no one ate the garlic knots I ordered! I think they were filled up with pizza and had no more room...We'll have to give them another chance next time. Thanks to Il Capo for the delicious eats",

    "text": "We visited Il Capo after finding it online while searching for something new in Scottsdale, where our vegetarian friends could find a broad selection of food. We arrived around 7pm, before our friends, admittedly on a weekday night and the place had three tables seated. The atmosphere was ok but no real ambience, and certainly no buzz from being busy.  After our friends arrived we ordered a chopped salad for the table and ordered three pizzas and a spaghetti and meatballs. The salad was excellent.  The pizzas, all vegetarian varieties, were lacking flavor. Possibly there was no seasoning so they were simply adequate. The crust was quite good, but the overall pizza just lacked something. The spaghetti and meatballs were good. The sauce was a little thick, but was good. It needed a lot of pepper to give it some flavor kick though.  Halfway through our meal, by around 8pm the restaurant was empty, with just our table working.  The service was very attentive and our waiter, Tim was really good. He knew the menu and was very accommodating with special requests for capers and olives on one of the pizzas.  If they take care with the seasoning on their pizzas they will do better. Overall it was ok.",

It was a filet raviolo with a Gorgonzola cream sauce and roasted pistachios. Well, we stopped in again last night on our way to a concert and I may have to rethink my top three. I ordered the Lupara. A simple pasta dish but the simplicity simply left me dazed and my eyes almost rolled back in my head! Rigatoni with ground sausage and pepperoncini powder in a tomato cream sauce and shaved Pecorino Romano. Good golly Miss Molly! We hadn't ordered the ever popular garlic knots, but after one bite, I placed that order as I figured picking up the bowl and licking out the rest of the sauce probably wasn't appropriate. The knots were perfect for sopping up the remainder of the sauce and I managed to not chip the bowl while attempting to get every last drop. It was so good that I slowed down to enjoy all of the different flavors and didn't spill one drop on my shirt, which is very rare. Salud il Capo!!!",

    "text": "OK. So I am a New Yorker. I have had some of the best Italian you can find anywhere outside of Italy. I just moved to Phoenix and one of my first orders of business was to search for an Italian restaurant. It just so happens that my parents, who still live in NY, were out to visit for Christmas and we decided to give Il Capo a try.   Going out to eat isn't an easy task, especially when you have 4 kids, ages 6, 4, 2 and 1, in tow. We were warmly greeted as we walked in and our server, Tim, set up the tables to accommodate our party of 8.  Since we had such a large party, we wanted to try a good sampling of various items on the menu.  We started with garlic knots, breaded clams and rice ball. The garlic knots were nice and big, perfectly cooked and seasoned wonderfully. The sauce it was served with was so good, I finished eating the rest of it with my fork. The rice ball was served on a bed of the sauce and sprinkled with cheese. The breading was crispy and the rice inside was moist and well flavored.  The breaded clams were a nice appetizer. There were 12 small clams with a well seasoned breading on the top of a bed of fresh arugula. Using the lemon juice over the arugula, it made a nice bonus salad.  The kids had a half cheese, half pepperoni pizza which had the perfect balance of toppings. The crust had a nice crunch and paired nicely with the sauce and mozzarella cheese.  My wife had the Chicago Beef Dip with sweet peppers and a pasta salad with a giardiniera type dressing. The beef and peppers were a perfect combination of flavors on the crunchy bread. The dip enhanced the flavor of the meat and peppers, which I didn't even think was possible. My parents split a Margherita pizza, which I have been craving for a while. The wood fire flavored crust matched with the olive oil, mozzarella, tomato sauce and basil all married together to form the perfect slice of pizza I was missing. I decided on the Chicken Parmesan, a staple at any Italian food joint. The chicken was nice and thin and covered with sauce and cheese, melted to form a slight crunch to the cheese. I was very impressed that the side of pasta wasn't just noodles with sauce tossed on top, but the noodles themselves were tossed with sauce before being placed on the plate which led to an even distribution of sauce all over the noodles. Some shaved cheese and parsley sprinkled on top were the perfect finishing touches to this dish.   After all of this, there was no way we were going to leave without desert. We got a plate of cannoli, a tiramisu, and a slice of NY Cheesecake.  The cannolis were excellent with a dusting of pistachio on one side and chocolate sprinkles on the other.  There were four of them on the plate and the shells were dusted with powdered sugar. The filling was the perfect cannoli consistency - thick and sweet. The cheesecake had cherries and a syrup on the top. I am not a cheesecake fan, but this was delicious. The sauce was not overbearing and the cheesecake itself was amazing. I primarily had the tiramisu, which is a tricky dish to master. Il Capo did just that. The lady fingers were soaked perfectly and the marscapone filling was done wonderfully. Too many times, the filling is too sweet in an effort compensate for the bitter goodness of the espresso soaked lady fingers, but not here. The desert portions were generous as well. The cheesecake and the tiramisu were nice sized and were were all able to sample a little of each.  A final note about our server, Tim. Excellent waiter! Most times a family with little kids strikes fear into the hearts of servers, but not Tim. He was very patient and kind with the kids and was always there with a refill on drinks and to make sure the food was up to our standards.  Excellent place, I will definitely be back to try some more of the menu. Unless they want to move their kitchen into mine. I'd be okay with that, too.",

Apps and beers were brought quickly, but still had no plates, utensils or napkins. Meatballs and caponata were solid. About 30 minutes after ordering entrees, server told us they had a problem and pizzas would be right out. Waiting.... Waiting... In the meantime, I ordered another beer. 10 minutes later, still no beer, still no pizza. I saw our server by the bar and gave him a raised eyebrow. I saw him make the \"oh, $hit, I forgot to put the order in\" face, and he quickly spoke to the bartender and sheepishly brought over my beer. Just rookie stuff.  Manager walked by and asked how things were, and apologized that it had been \"20 minutes\" since we ordered entrees. We told her it had been over 40 minutes since ordering and she said, \"Well, I'll have to check the ticket on that\". Pro tip -- do not argue with or demean your customer, especially one who hasn't been served well or raised a fuss, even though the service was awful.   Pizzas arrived after 45 minutes and were decent -- better than chain pizzerias, but nowhere near Pomo/Federal/Bianco/Parlor quality.  Wouldn't trust them with my money and time again. Too many other options with better food and professional service with management who cares.",

    "text": "Sadly, I am changing my five star review to a one star review, based on terrible customer service. I have been a loyal customer. The food is excellent. I have introduced friends to the restaurant. After tonight's horrible and disrespectful service, which could have been easily rectified but was not, I will not be back. We waited for over a half an hour for our food. That was Ok. We were sharing a bottle of wine and enjoying our conversation. When the food finally came, they had messed up my order and had to redo it. OK. By the time my food came out my friend was done with her meal. Not so OK. By the time I was done we had missed our movie. Not so OK either.  The bill came with no apology and they charged me for my very late meal. I asked to speak to the manager, explained my situation and asked to have my meal taken off the bill. She was very nice, said she understood, and said she would get it taken care of.  After another wait and having to ask for the bill yet again, I discovered that they had only taken half my meal off. When I got up from the table to asked what happened she said she had called the owner and had been told to do that. When I asked why she didn't bother to let me know that when the waiter brought back the bill she just looked at me and said \"no one told you?\" That was it. No apology. Did not seem to care a bit when I said she had just lost a customer.  Not OK at all. Customer service is as important to me as the food. If you don't take care of your customers you'll lose them. They have certainly lost me. What a shame. Looking at the other reviews here it looks like they have lost more than one customer. By the way, we walked in at 6 and left at 8. How's that for S. L. O. W.",

Their pizza sauce and dough is fabulous with a great specialty pizza called a grandma pizza. As a prior NYC resident, this is a sublime piece of home. Great HH menu which extends daily for most of the day. Garlic knots are great. Meatballs are tender and flavorful. Not one bad choice on their menu.  Service is attentive and speedy.  Highly recommend this restaurant",

It's too bad that parking at il Capo is so difficult, because the food is very good, they have a great wine list and I enjoy watching the staff who are some of the hardest working guys around here.  Unfortunately, the entire experience is a stressful mob scene.  It's at the strip center at the NE corner of Scottsdale Rd & Shea, right across from the movie theater.  There's not enough parking at this mall; in fact it's so bad you usually have to wait for a space at dinner time.  The small restaurant itself is also literally packed shoulder to shoulder, both standing around and waiting and seated at a table.  Both inside and outside are like a street scene from that old movie Soylent Green (if you haven't ever seen it, I highly recommend!).  I've had their pizza a few times and it's consistently been excellent and the service has always been great, but Il Bosco on the other side of Scottsdale Rd is even better and not quite so hectic.",

Our server's name was Mark, amazing service-knows the dishes well & gave great recommendations. You can come in & eat by the slice or whole pizza, pastas, etc. We got one grandma slice (recommended to us & HIGHLY recommend myself!) then ordered off of happy hour. One 12\" pizza two toppings for $11 bucks, great! I also got a small greens salad added chicken with the basil vinaigrette. I would put the vinaigrette on anything! We will definitely be back!",

The wine choices were nice, and they had a good selection of beers I also noted. We all picked pasta dishes although as we were watching what the other diners getting we were salivating awaiting our own choices! I had the Fettuccini Carbonara, it was creamy and delicious! Another couple had the Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Chicken Parm they were praising their choices and the fourth guest had the Lupara and she went wild over that. We all shared the garlic knots that came with a side of marinara sauce that was fresh and savory. If we had room we would have loved to try the gelatos of which they had quite a variety and was sooo tempting to try but we were all stuffed and taking a lot home to enjoy the next day. We had a great time and if it had been cooler would have loved sitting outside on their big patio. You can't go wrong here. Portions are huge and if everything is as good as what we had I'm sure no one would be unhappy or go home hungry! So glad we found this gem!!",

I go to Il Capo regularly with my friends, the Wednesday night half price bottle special makes the perfect girls night hangout before seeing a movie or after doing volunteer service.   The best server there is Jimmy James. He's really knowledgeable, mellow, and kind.  It's great to see him know his regular customers by name and the relationships he has with them.  It reminds me of being in a TV show. Where you are known and welcomed by the staff, and you can relax and have a good time with them and the other patrons in the restaurant.  Plus the music list is awesome!!  I hear all kinds of good energy music when I'm there, whether it's lunch or happy hour.    If you want that feeling of everyone know's your name, you should totally go to Il Capo.  And ask for Jimmy James.  He'll take good care of you.",

    "text": "Solid 4 stars.  They may have counter service for slices but I was seated and handed a menu instead the few times I've been here. Just trying to get a quick slice for lunch. The owner has reached out and assured me there is an express counter to order from and I'll give it a go again soon.   When I want a pizza slice for lunch there's usually 2 main reasons driving that decision. (other than my love for pizza)  1. I want a fast meal, order at the counter and leave the moment I am done. Lunch break time is precious and every minute counts. I had to chase down my server each time...  2. I want an inexpensive meal with no need to pay extra tipping a full service waiter or waitress. This is a slice of pizza we're talking about!  20% tip is less than a dollar. Does the waitstaff really benefit from 60 cents or do they expect us to tip 30% or more? Seriously? That's why such a hub bub about the whole express counter service option.  As far as the food goes, it's actually pretty good. I tried the ribs appetizer my first visit. Nice and tender but left little room for pizza for me that time. Been back only a few times since and got a slice for lunch each time.  Slices are very filling and I like the whole happy hour all day (practically) and they offer free garlic knots with yelp checkins. A little greas & undercooked this time but the last time they were much better.  See others' pictures, the dark golden brown knots you see from other Yelpers are what I had the 1st time.  To be honest the slices are kind of expensive but you get a decent value with Yelp check in (if you like garlic knots that is)   Perhaps create some slices specials that appeal to those of us on a budget (or aren't in the mood for knots) then I feel it may get even more traffic then it does now.  I'd certainly go back! Many business offer 2 deal choices on a single yelp checkin screen.",

Wife ordered the spaghetti & meatballs which I had last time and was delicious. Today the pasta tasted as if the it was made earlier and just reheated by dropping in hot water. Plus, not much sauce. I decided on chicken parmigiana, this was rubbery. Again, like it was previously made. Nice service and people but was a disappointment. I thought we had a go to Italian spot nearby, now I am second guessing. Too bad!",

I was a little hesitant at first since it was completely dead inside, the food was amazing, the service was good and the price was right.  What else do you want?  The eggplant parmesan is the best i have ever had, i have been trying to find an eggplant parm that is just as good as the homemade stuff I have had from a friends mom.  I finally found it!  Wahoo!  I got the eggplant parm hero which was SO GOOD.  The bread that came with the sandwich was awesome too!  I am going to start telling everyone i know about this place.    They haven't been open long so that is why it wasn't that busy.  GO NOW before this place gets cracking!",

You must keep your dog leashed up, no free roaming, excellent rule:) very relaxing atmosphere to enjoy the beautiful day and eat.  Inside is just as awesome. The bar is gorgeous! Not just all the drinks, but the beauty of the wood, Stools, and what the happy hour specials are displayed (very easy to read)  Excellent customer service!! Every time we have visited they make sure that you're enjoying everything from the table, food, drinks, it all.   They have an apple arugala salad that's delicious! That is my favorite! Try it! Yum!  This place is in a great spot and are off to a great start!  Awesome local business to support!",

We stopped in just after 5:00, it was happy hour so the wine was $3 off and beer and cocktails were also discounted.   We ordered a few slices and the chopped salad. The salad is so good, so many delicious flavors and dressed perfectly. They had 2 different white pies! Yum!   We had the same waiter as last time, I can't remember his name...really nice young guy who is hoping going into the Navy Officer program. Great service.   The owner stopped over to see how our meal was and we joked that il Capo might have to be our Sunday spot. He had mentioned the chef just brought out a fresh tiramisu for him to taste and he would love to have us try it after our meal. He brought us a complimentary tiramisu to share as a family and it was delicious. Not overly sweet, perfectly creamy and the coffee flavor was so good.   As we were leaving, we were happy to see the restaurant was filling up. They are only a few months old and I think they will do a great business.   (They have some pies, stromboli, garlic knots etc. ready by the kitchen and we noticed a few people come in to grab a few slices to-go. Something to keep in mind for lunch or a quick bite).",

This is so good here.  Support a good place that uses high quality ingredients: grande mozzarella cheese (the best, trust me I used to manage a great pizzeria), San Marzano tomatoes from Italy . . . These items are expensive!!! But the prices charged for their pizzas and pastas are reasonable.  Promise I'm just an enthusiastic guest, not family.  Been here three times and all were perfect.  The cioppino tonight with squid ink tagliellini is fantastic!!!",

With the weather being so beautiful, we sat on the patio. It was clean and enjoyable, which is a big deal for me as I'm not a big fan of eating outside!   We started with some beers and garlic knots. The beers were good, but the knots were a bit overdone. Still OK, just not the best. But, that's fine, because it's the pizza that got me hooked!!  My husband ordered the meatball pizza, and I the Diavolo. There. Are. No. Words. That little devil was incredible! The spice, the flavor, the crust! I'm eating the leftovers now, and I'm still so happy. The meatball pizza was also very good! We left satisfied and will return again!",

    "text": "I was so excited to give this place 5 stars but couldn't begin to pull the trigger.  The food is worthy of it, but the service and atmosphere insists that I kick it down a notch.  Sorry!  The pizza was fantastic.  I ordered The Boss and it was huge.  Crust was wonderful and ingredients were abundant and fresh.  It tasted great and the texture was awesome.  Really just a wonderful Za.  We also ordered the pear salad which was fantastic.  We saw other orders coming out and they all looked equally as special.  The slices available for a quick grab and go looked great too.    But the acoustics were horrible.  I couldn't carry on a conversation once a few people got there after their movie got out.  I couldn't even understand the waitress when she was explaining something about the gelato.  She was new, so I don't wanna rattle the cage too much but after our pizza came she was overly occupied with small talk with other tables it seemed.  The place is small, so there can't be more than 20 tables but she seemed a little overwhelmed.  Plus, the tables are way too close.  Another couple came in and sat down next to us and I felt as though I was obligated to have a conversation with them.  That's too close.    Lastly, that darned Western exposure is a killer at dusk and between having the sun glaring in our faces, the couple almost on top of us and the fact that we couldn't hear ourselves over the rest of the noise in the place really undid so much of the quality that we would've enjoyed otherwise.  But if you want a great pizza, I'd have to say that this is on the top of the list.  I hope that they can cozy it up a little bit and put some padding on the ceiling or something.  If I was in a comfy booth facing away from the sun I think that it would have been there.  Right now I am just happy that I've got 3 slices left over for the week!!!",

We stopped in with friends on a quiet Monday night.  We had attentive service and full water glasses to go with our delicious food.    We ordered the Hippy Roll, which happened to have spinach and mozzarella that day, and came with a side of marinara for dipping.  Perfect crust, perfect melty ingredients - totally delicious.  We also got the Apple and Arugula Salad, which was light yet generous, and lovely - the slightly salty cheese was perfect with the light  sweetness of the honey shallot vinaigrette.    Our friends had the gluten free funghi pizza, and were kind enough to give us a taste - the crust was quite nice (not weird at all) and the mushrooms were aromatic and flavorful.  Their pear salad looked so good, with its yellow grape tomatoes, that I might have to try it next time.  We didn't come all that hungry, and regrettably had to pass on dessert, but we'll bring bigger appetites next time.  I understand the tiramisu is homemade!  Can't wait to come back!",

Wife had a great salad,  almost big enough for two.   I shared a custom 12\" pizza,  and they threw in some delicious garlic knots for checking in via Yelp.  Knots were covered in butter and garlic almost like escargo but without the snail or shell!  Will definitely come back the next time I am not craving pizza to try their other menu offer offerings.",

He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, prompt, and courteous. Be sure to ask for him!  Don't go anywhere else, this place is fantastic!  We will be back!

It was Sat evening and they were fairly quiet...they are newer yet so hopefully as word spreads business will pickup. As I browsed the menu posted outside a few of the staff would stop and ask if I had any questions or needed any help, but not in that annoying obnoxious way some staff can be. They were very friendly.   I decided to eat on the patio which is dog friendly. This doesn't bother me but an FYI if that is something that bothers you before you decide to choose to sit outside.   Our server was very friendly and helpful. When we asked about the salads he suggested that we could probably split (between 2 of us) one rather than each of us getting our own. We got the Caesar with chicken add-on. The chicken was plentiful and the quantity of dressing was just right...the romaine was not drowning in it. We then split the Cacciare wood fired pizza. Our server explained how to oven was imported from Naples. Let me say, it was absolutely worth it. The pizza crust was exquisite and cooked perfectly with very flavorful toppings.  On the downside they were out of some of the SanTan brews...good to see people drinking local but disappointed none available during our visit.",

They brought our salads out already split up onto two plates.  The food was delicious and the staff was super friendly and helpful.   And the Hard Root Beer was amazing!",

This place doesn't take the Italian theme to the strict nth degree like some places have, instead creating a comfortable familiar place that is still date worthy.   Perfect for dinner and a movie.",
