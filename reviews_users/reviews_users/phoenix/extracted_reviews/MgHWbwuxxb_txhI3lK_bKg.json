    "text": "I originally gave Main Ingredient two stars based on my initial visit. Now that I have been several more times, I'm inclined to up it one star to three.   Main ingredient, like so much in Phoenix, is nestled inside a historic bungalow. I love this style of restaurant or bar so much and it kind of makes me feel like it's Phoenix's thing. For the home bars, this is one of the cleaner ones. It's actually spotless, and they feature nicer charis, tables, etc. than most of the rest. Call it upscale, or comparable to Roosevelt if you will.   Food here is good, I especially enjoy the Coronado Coney, a Schreiner's all beef hot dog with an awesome nut brown ale mustard and a locally made bun. The Red Goat is exceptional if you are in the mood for a salad, with goat cheese, strawberries, mixed greens, and a vinagrette. The standout here, though, is the Green Chile Mac N' Cheese. An absolute artery clogger, but phenomenal from start to finish.   It's hard to fault The Main Ingredient for it's choice of music, too. The mix of 80's and 90's hip-hop fits the atmosphere so well and really gives off a house party type vibe.   What's keeping this place from reaching 4 or 5 stars? The same thing that got it two stars from me initially, the shitty selection of beer. If you're going to call yourself an \"ale house\" then please consider stocking a really great selection of really great beers. The hipster beers (old style, schlitz, pbr) don't do it for me. I have taste. Please cater to it.",

    "text": "Slightly \"off\". Cute place, decent menu, okay beer/wine list, meh ambiance, average service. The best analogy I can make is like a Roosevelt-lite. It's similarly decorated, similarly cramped, similarly styled, but not as good.  I found nothing on the beer list that knocked my socks off. Heavy on the Four Peaks offerings, which is fine, but if I wanted some Four Peaks beer... I would just go. I felt the same about the wine list. The food menu manages to be small yet versatile at once -- more than one token vegetarian option, for example -- although I agree with the sentiment about lunch foods for dinner (as in: no). The grilled cheese has potential, although mine arrived slightly undercooked, flaccid, and room temperature in the middle. The side salad was awesome! Simplicity is sometimes a good thing in a salad. A generous amount of field greens with the perfect amount of some light lemony dressing -- just delicious. My SO had some turkey sandwich with jalapeno cream cheese that he seemed quite fond of.   After the meh-ness of the beer and wine list, I was hoping to take advantage of the supposedly full bar. Coffee with Kahlua, Bailey's, anything like that? Um, no. The waitress (who would only deign to engage my SO with eye contact, preferring to stare at the floor when speaking to me) said some people have it with whiskey. Fine. The coffee wasn't super hot, and she never even asked about cream and sugar.   We shared the ice cream sampler -- one dish each of vanilla, stout, and salted caramel almond -- for dessert. The vanilla was excellent, with a rich malty finish. The stout, well, kind of reminded me of coffee (but delicious nonetheless). The salted caramel almond was too much of a good thing -- too much salt, too many nuts, too sweet, too much of a punch in the mouth.   The crowd was bizarre. We got there pretty early for a Saturday, 6 pm, and the place was packed! We were lucky to score a table amid the couples on dates and guys playing cards. By the time we finished up, the place was half-empty, leaving us next to the table full of loud chicks with a toddler.   Will we be back? Well, probably - it's a stone's throw from home, and I'm curious to try the mac-and-cheese. Will it end up on the regular rotation list? Not so sure about that.",

    "text": "A fine glass of zinfandel while relaxing to beats of the Pharcyde: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqAfrhmIvZ_s&s=8cb2ee88c2eb869d0abc17332a21e758a20c60ea05660d78b72ff2ce2b141507\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=qAfr...</a> . Ladies and gentlemen, your newest member of Phoenix's local restaurant community: The Main Ingredient Ale House & Cafe.   When I heard TMI was opening last night, I knew I had to go immediately as my work is very soon going to keep me away from Phoenix a lot over the next few months. I wanted to at least check it out now so I'll remember to go again during those brief periods that I'm back.   I was greeted warmly as soon as I walked in by Courtney, who along with her husband Matt are the co-owners. I took a look around the main part of the restaurant - not too many major changes of the interior from its Lisa G days, but still a great vibe. And a De La Soul poster! Word.   I then headed towards the bar, sat down and introduced myself to Matt, who I could tell was stoked about his first full day open. The bar itself was full of regular folks from the neighborhood and other local business owners who were there to chip in their support. A nice selection of microbrews on tap in front of me, and on the back shelf an array of wine and a vintage Schiltz statue holding up a lighted globe.   I took a look at the menu and noticed both carnivorous and vegiforous options, with everything around $10 or under. Desserts included 3 flavors from Crave ice cream (their neighbor) and offerings from the Arizona Cheesecake Company (Mark and Courtney told me that they wanted to keep everything as local as possible).   I saw Ayesha S.'s chile mac n' cheese, which looked great and she gave it her thumbs up of approval. Alas, with my doc-prescribed food restrictions, I had to limit myself to just a couple of things. I started off with a bowl of olives ($3) and then had the Winner salad ($9) which included mixed greens, turkey, egg, strips of salami, and some others items which at the moment I've forgotten. The olives were strong - a lot of  garlic and spice - which I was fine with but wasn't sure how others would take it. The salad was great, although I had to pick out the salami (thanks, doc). Someday I'll be able to eat the whole thing, along with the rest of the menu (hopefully).  To drink I had two glasses of wine - a cab and a zin. I'm only supposed limit myself to one glass, but as TMI was brand new and I'd eaten rabbit food all day and was having a good time, why the hell not. Both glasses were great, and I also got a small taste of a brand new concoction by Matt -  a rich, chocolatey porter ale with raspberry-infused vodka. Tasted like liquid dessert. Too bad I can't really order it moving forward but Matt's got a winner on his hands.  In terms of music, old school hip-hop beats and other phat tunes. Matt and I are the same age so I was appreciating each track that came on (Tribe, Digable, etc. Hell, even PM Dawn! Whatever happened to those guys?).  Volume was just right.   As the evening wound to a close, I was able to talk to the owners further - about their plans for the place, their back story, on opening a new business - and really felt great that this house just off 7th Street is  in the hands of a young, energetic couple ready to make their own imprint on the Coronado neighborhood as well as Phoenix in general.   Best to their success.  4 stars for now (come on, it's Day 1).  THE MAIN DETAILS --------------------------- * Open 11 am -11 pm M-Th, till midnight Fri-Sat, closed Sun. * Happy hour prices on drinks from 11 am - 6 pm (!) * Casual * Outdoor and indoor seating * Inexpensive food; lunch & dinner * Beer and wine focus; limited cocktails * Unpretentious * Just your friendly, neighborhood spot * Will I come back? Definitely.  And there you have it.   Cheers.",

    "text": "This place is my jam - and not just because it's always bumping awesome hip hop, including selections not reguarly heard since my high school friends' mix CDs were on repeat in our parents' cars.   No, also because it has a nice wine selection, full bar, tasty (if simple) food, solid veg options, and that chilled out \"Phoenix bar in a house\" vibe.   My only gripe is that if you think this place is just perfect for a large group of your friends to post out on the patio, you will be heartbroken to discover the outdoor tables cannot be moved!  It isn't so much an issue of me constantly rolling with more than 5 friends (ha!), but more the senselessness of this limitation on outside seating configurations.  I just don't understand, and it upsets me.   But oh well - we've all loved despite not understanding before.",

Get it on Saturday when you can get Vegan Chili on top, after all what is better to do with vegan chili than to put it on a giant hot dog?  The dog is gigantic as well, I have brought the other half of it home as left overs, that is a first for a hot dog. Of course it is a Shreiner's sausage so that's a good thing  The beer selection is excellent and well priced. They have a great number of AZ brews on tap and in bottle and a good amount of knowledge about them.   Get the side of fresh greens, it'll make you feel way better about eating that giant hot dog and the other choice is potato chips anyway...",

    "text": "Better than a jab in the eye, that's for sure.  In all seriousness, TMI is a great spot thus far for the busy downtown lunch crowd. I've been twice since opening, once for happy hour drinks and another for lunch. While the draft beer selection leaves something to be desired, the bottled selection is a notch above standard fare. As mentioned in previous reviews, Four Peaks is near and dear to my heart but I can throw rocks from almost any point in Phoenix and hit a pub/restaurant with their beers. At least they have Hop Knot, which most places do not have on draft.  Sampled thus far from the menu:   Chips and Salsa, of which neither are store bought, chips are thin and appropriately salted. The salsa is medium, as stated on the menu, but with a good consistency and just a hint of heat.  TMI Dip, with bits of jalapenos in a warm cheese sauce this appetizer really hits the spot. A generous amount of bread chips is given along with and the quantity went the distance of the dip, which can be a problem sometimes (I'm thinking pita and hummus, never enough pita)  2na sammy, warm tuna with tomatoes and onions on a buttery bun. I can say I was satisfied but it seemed almost... bland. I'll probably give it another shot when I've gone through other menu items.  Past what I sampled personally, I've seen the veggie sandwich, the griddled cheese (very cheesy!) and the coney. A friend called TMI's coney the best \"hot dog\" he's had in Phoenix. A lofty claim to be sure, but it did look excellent, maybe I'm just a sucker for mustard (which looked homemade).  Chips with pickle or mixed greens as the sides of the hour for the entrees, I've had both and found the chips to be my preference. The mixed greens could use, something, anything really to win me over. Postinos standard greens, dressing, cherry tomatoes and pine nuts aren't over the top but seem much more appealing. I can say the house dressing on the greens is great.  I've finally arrived at my negative comment, the service. I'm unfamiliar with the experience level of the servers but on both occasions my party has sat on the patio and each time the servers were sub-par. First time around we sat with empty glasses for 5-10 minutes on multiple occasions, though it was 6-7:30 and not particularly busy outside. The second encounter (lunch) was met with a server who seemed nervous and failed to correctly take my orders \"quirk\", I asked for the mixed greens WITH the pickle as well (on the previous trip my friend had this done without any issue). It's minor, but worth the mention as I think pickles are divine gifts from the heavens.  I'm excited to have a good lunch spot to meet friends during the week, I only hope that the draft selection gets a bit more variety and the servers shake off the opening jitters to really kick some ass.",

    "text": "Three stars instead of four because I have a fundamental problem with restaurants that serve lunch food at dinner time. It's the main reason I haven't yet been to Carly's Bistro or Postino. I want something hot to eat with a knife and fork, thank you very much. Sandwiches (excluding burgers) and salads are mid-day meals.  Vent over. On to the good stuff.   This place is very welcoming, polished, and sophisticated without breaking the bank. They've only been open, what, two weeks? and the joint was hopping on this Friday evening around 5:45. We went for dinner and neither of us had drinks, so this review is for the ambience and food only.   We ordered the chips and salsa, the olives (oh my goodness! Rosemary deliciousness!), the mac and cheese (the kudos have already been spread generously, and I agree with all of them, but I wish it came in a main-dish portion), the Griddled Cheese (looked fab, but hubby ate it in about three bites so I didn't get to try any) and the Tuna Salad Salad, which was delectable.   Service was slow, but very apologetic and accurate. I think maybe they weren't expecting to be so busy, as they only had two servers for a packed house.  One nitpicky complaint: why the big TV in the dining area? I can forgive it in a bar, but in the dining room I'd rather not be distracted (or watch my date get distracted) by X-treme Sports coverage overhead.  I'd definitely go back for lunch, but I'll save my dinners out for places that actually serve dinner.",

I didn't have a chance to see much of the inside as it was so gorgeous out, I couldn't help but sit on the patio. However, I love the look and feel. It feels homey and comfortable, but almost like your home is in the middle of a tiny forest.   The food was good. Between our appetizer and our food we left completely stuffed. For a main dish I had to try the much deliberated mac and cheese. While it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was good and a great fit for the night. I paired it with, well, a glass of Kung Fu Girl Riesling... suits me well I think. My visitor had one of the sandwiches with chips and found it perfect.   The service was on par except for when it came to get our bill. Then, we sat there for 10 minutes and had to flag him down. Additionally, our appetizer came out at the same time as our main dishes.  Food Good. Service Good. Not sure I would come again on my own will, as the menu isn't standing out in my head a week later, but I will probably end up here again somehow, and I won't mind.",

    "text": "Hi-Ya, folks!  May I start off by saying that anyone expecting a CAFE to serve entrees at night is a little...well....dipsy? That's what this is: a cafe. Learn it, love it.  I spent the good part of a Saturday afternoon at this lil' nook with the BF soaking up what was left of the sun before the poopy grey clouds took over and prepared to dump their contents on Phoenix the next morning.  Gotta tell ya - the service was \"meh +\". Took way longer than necessary to get menus/waters/the basics right from the get-go. And they were not overwhelmed. Decent crowd but not busting-at-the-seams busy, so rerally no excuse for the overly-slow welcome and startup. We sat outside which was really pleasant and relaxing - I highly recommend sitting on the side of the patio that catches the sun. It's mucho nice-o! My prediction is that this place will have some nice summer business.  Drinks specials are totally reasonable - had the Odella Red Ale which was a nice compliment to the artichoke dip appetizer which came with very fresh tortilla chips. Also had \"the Veg\" which was a panini style sandwich on flatbread with goat cheese and portabello and other veggies. Light, fresh, and easy on the taste buds. Would like to mention that the kitchen very courteously split this sandwich on two plates for us. Thanks!  If the wait staff gets a little more \"umph\" and urgency behind itself, they may have a potential afternoon hit on their hands.  (I still love and miss and am not cheating on you, lisa G)",

If you can find one!! This is a neighborhood pub so it's usually crowded. But it's a great place to drop by and relax.  The green chili stew is so so so delicious.",

    "text": "This place is pretty good. I had a veggie sandwich about 6 months ago I really liked. More recently I came last night and got the quesadilla. It was alright- split it with my friend. Pretty average, but I think that is why you don't order a quesadilla at a sandwich place. The artichoke dip we got was AMAZING. The chips are to die. The beach bellini(sub vodka) is really good, and the beer selection is awesome. One weird thing- a fly flew in my drink and the waiter brought it back filled to around the same level? I guess that's fair, but our whole group just thought it was really weird and kind of poor judgement- like... Are you sure you didn't just take the fly out!? You really can't refill that 1/4 for customer satisfaction? Oh well, would still come back.",

    "text": "Housed in what used to be Lisa G Wine Cafe, The Main Ingredient makes great use of the space with a hip, yet charming, update.  The address is so Phoenix style essentially an old home turned into a restaurant with hardwood floors, a fireplace and patio seating. The chairs are comfy and beckon you to relax and enjoy the warm hospitality.  The Main Ingredient will make for a great new hangout for beer lovers like me -- they offer more than 20 varieties. The beverage menu also has many wines by the glass and bottle.  The menu is composed of a few nibbly things, salads and sandwiches. With the most expensive menu item topping out at $10, The Main Ingredient is wallet friendly.  Marinated with citrus zest, rosemary, garlic and red pepper, the house blended Olives ($3) were a favorite -- we ate them all. Pro-Pasto ($10) is an ode to cured meats, cheeses, roasted veggies, more olives and crostini.  As I sipped my Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale ($8), I couldn't help but notice how diverse the restaurant's guests were. There was a gay couple looking like they were on a first date, a group of 20-somethings laughing and a smattering of other couples enjoying themselves. It was a great vibe.  Rounding off our starters were the Artichoke Heaven ($7) and Mindy's Mac and Cheese ($7). The artichoke cheese dip had a hint of spiciness and was served with tortilla chips. Mindy's Mac and Cheese was tasty and I enjoyed the cheesy baked crunchy edges.  Sure to please, the Griddled Cheese ($7) is a combination of havarti, muenster and cheddar topped with tomato, which I quickly removed since I'm a cheese sandwich purist.  Cash Money ($6) is a tribute to old school peanut butter and jelly, but instead uses cashew butter, red pepper Cabernet jelly and sliced banana on sourdough bread. At first I was going to order this for dessert, but thought better of it. Be sure to order chips with this -- it's all about salty and sweet.  If you love hot dogs, you'll love the Coronado Coney ($6). They top a jumbo Schreiner's all-beef frank with red onion and spicy Nut Brown Ale Mustard. I liked the hot dog but wished there had been less mustard and more onion.  While we were too full for dessert, the Chili and Chocolate Cheesecake ($5) sounded like something I'd try on another visit.",

Just ask Aaron Chamberlin chef/owner of St. Francis and his girlfriend Lee del Real whom have only been in their petite, 1950's bungalow in the Coronado historic neighborhood for maybe 4 months now.  The Main Ingredient herself lives in a 1930's maybe 40's sleek and timeless Bungalow home in the Coronado Historic District. It's not hard to noticed MI's roomy patio as you walk up and then notice it is also 'dog friendly'.  The interior is both enchanting and intriguing with the use of dense materials from our Phoenician Forefathers. Good looking oak flooring. Phoenix Red Brick fireplace and sage green finished plaster walls and ceiling which gives every room a darker and very intimate feel.  I realize MI has an award winning top dog, a plump, juicy all-beef frank from Schreiner's Sausage, a local institution right up the street. The dog is tucked into a soft, dense sourdough bun that's lightly toasted, slathered with spicy Boont Amber Ale mustard, and sprinkled with red onion. $7.  Sounds heavenly right? You know it is, but I go for Tenderbelly bacon, local tomato, sliced avocado, red onion, field greens & house-made chipotle mayo, on sourdough. The meat is thick, the avocado is rich and the sandwich finishes with a little chipotle heat.$8.  My draft ale was good and I cant remember which one I bought, but it was loud and hoppy. $5 And Thank You Haylee, we had a great time.",

I specifically asked if prosciutto came with it and they said yes but none came with it. Even still it's really good!

I came here for lunch and ordered the BLT sandwich. I'm not much of a BLT sandwich guy but the thought of pork belly bacon raised my interest.  Needless to say I was totally satisfied. Mmmmmm...The bacon wasn't too crispy and it didn't fall apart like most bacon would when you take a first bite. The avocado was a perfect match. My mouth is watering talking about this BLT sandwich haha!  My friend order the Winner salad -- you can't go wrong with a name like that.  Turkey, salami and hardboiled eggs.  Seems pretty basis but definitely worth a try!  Service was real good and my water was quick to fill.  The place itself was full of different artworks.  The front yard is the patio, but not enough sunlight hits it so I decided to sit indoors. However, I'm sure I'll come back someday to sit outdoors.  HH all day Sunday! - Enjoy!",

They have Happy Hour all day on Monday, but I recommend not arriving before 7:45 pm because otherwise it's so popular that you'll probably be forced to sit inside.

    "text": "I write this review from a hospital bed where I currently lay, getting a tetanus shot.  I planned on giving a scathing review of \"THE MAIN INGREDIENT, ALE HOUSE CAFE\" until it occurred to me that this is NOT in fact a restaurant, but a very expensive piece of conceptual art.    My coworker and I arrived at 7pm. The ambience felt very TGI Fridays Esque. How Avant garde! From a service standpoint I would say they still haven't gotten this right just yet because the well meaning staff seem to also be in on the fact that this is not really a restaurant as well. Therefore, no one attends to you or listens to your basic requests like : \"Excuse me, can I have a water? or \"can I trouble you for a fork?\". No, in fact they seem to listen and shake their heads and say, silly patrons- thats NOT what we DO here at \"The Main Ingredient Ale House\".   This one fact certainly can be improved upon as part of the overall dining \"experience\".   When it was our time to order, my friend ordered the Mushroom Bisque, and I ordered a salad entitled, \"The Winner\".  The \"Winner\" salad boasts fresh romaine, field greens, thinly sliced  turkey, genoa salami, fresh mozzarella, local tomatoes, hard-cooked egg, & kalamata olives, tossed with lemon vinaigrette.   Following a 30 minute wait the waitress returned, looked me square in the the eye and said, \"Here is your WINNER salad. Enjoy\".   I took one bite of my winner salad and wondered out loud, \"I wonder what the main ingredient is?\" My coworker and i shared a nice laugh.   No sooner had I taken my second bite when all my questions were answered. Just as I chewed into my romaine, my teeth came down on a hard cold, greasy tasting piece of metal. My confusion caused me to bite down again one more time until the sharp end of the main ingredient gouged the roof of my mouth. I then promptly spit the main ingredient out and called over the waitress.  Me: \"Miss, please. There is a screw in my salad.\" Waitress: \" Oh sorry! Let me look into this. \"  Several minutes later after a detailed investigation of all the screws loose in their kitchen,  the manager returned with her rendition about the specific type of screw family that was not indigenous to the exact type of loose screws found in and around her kitchen.   She then said: Manager: \"We don't have those screws here. ....Welp. Were obviously going to have to pay for your meal and we sure hope you give us another try. Here is gift certificate to the Main Ingredient.\"   Me, (Confused): \"Thank you so much. I most definitely will not return as I am probably going to go to the hospital to get a tetanus shot from here. Please tell the owner to contact me immediately or he will be hearing from my lawyer.\"  What I didn't see then, I do now in regards to the overall artistic message of their performance and my experience.   The message was simple. The Main Ingredient in A \"Winner \"Salad or , \"Life\", is not success, or perseverance, but --that you are both literally and metaphorically screwed. Both the wait staff and management repeatedly tried conveying this message to me over and over.   My coworker seems to think the message is even more simple.  His take: \"The main ingredient here is screw you.\"  To date, its been 3 hours and I have still yet to hear from the Owner of \"The Main Ingredient\".   One star.",

    "text": "Thursday evening, early and I was invited to dine with friends. I was looking forward to my first trip here. Really lousy service.  I ordered the veggie quesadilla after waiting ample time that the food should have been on it's way out, instead, the waitress comes back to confess that it would be 10 more minutes if I was to wait on the tortillas that they were out of.  So instead of holding up dinner any longer, I opted for the soup choice mushroom.  and waiting, waiting still - now I'm told just a few more minutes and we will have your quesadilla out.  So obviously they would rather serve beer & sandwiches so take the vegetarian options OFF YOUR MENU instead of making the entire table wait for your short comings OR at least make a gesture of kindness from management. But the server was not so bright either, she brought a pitcher of water with no ice to the outdoor patio after we waited forever for refills.  When I finally got the food it was a slick slimy grease disaster and the guac and salsa were very nice.  I'd just never go back and waste anyone's money here.   As a career waitress it breaks my heart to see that most restaurants just don't get who is paying their bills - their valuable customers. So sorry I was not so valuable to this establishment last night that management could not come and control the damage themselves.",

Parking was limited and I ended up parking down the street rather than in the parking lot. The lunch menu was small... Just appetizers, salads and sandwiches. I chose a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich. When it came, there were small pieces of green lettuce or parsley dried on the bread and the edge of the bread was green where they had clearly used a dirty knife to cut it! They made me a new sandwich, but after that my waitress was MIA. Luckily I had work to do because I did not see her for at least 20 minutes after my meal was done. I ordered coffee and she brought cream but no sugar and I had to ask the lady bussing tables to get some for me. Then it took forever for her to bring the bill after I asked. Needless to say, I will not be a repeat customer!",

This time we hit bottom. Nothing even imaginative for a beer selection. Best they had was Odel IPA, which is good, but I can get that at Sprouts or Total Wine anytime for $8.99 a six pack. Next had some some salsa and chips. The chips were over the top salty and very oily. The salsa was too hot to even eat. Next I got the roast beef and cheese with horseradish on a baguette. It would have had no flavor at all without the horseradish.  I have had better at Arby's. My wife got the veggie quesadilla, which she had gotten before. This time she says it was awful.  The onions tasted hard and stringy, old. The tortilla was stale. She only ate about a third and had to stop. The worst part about it was that we told the waiter/server/kid and he apologized, but brought us the bill without saying another word even though we told him that we have been there several times before and this was the worst. Needless to say we paid our bill with the exact change with no tip and we will not be going back. Too bad for both of us..........",

They still live in the same house they did forty years ago, when we were just bratty little kids terrorizing the block on our Big Wheels. So what a treat to find that The Main Ingredient was opening up just a hop and a skip away from my old stomping grounds!  The word \"alehouse\" caught my eye originally, as I tend to be a sucker for any place that has a decent beer selection. I became a fan of this place on Facebook so I would be informed when they were ready for business. When I finally made it here, about a week after they opened, I was not disappointed. Ordered a nut-brown ale and some green chili mac 'n cheese. Also tried the artichoke spinach dip which was arguably the tastiest I've ever had. The mac n' cheese was creamy and comforting and the green chili subtle, but I wish it had more of a salty sharp cheesy bite to it. Also sampled a forkful of the Winner salad and it was indeed a winner.  So I will return again to reminisce with childhood friends over a pint or three. And I won't hesitate to try the rest of the menu as the food here is obviously high caliber. I didn't ask about the origin of the name of the restaurant, but in my opinion, the main ingredient served here is love. Can you feel the love?",

That said, there's a lot of recommend it.  TMI is a once-house, now-restaurant with a very relaxed vibe.  Along with private and community tables, they also offer couches and outdoor seating, and everything is decorated in swanky, relaxing colors.  Their menu is unique but simple, focusing on salads and sandwiches.  These aren't your average sandwich, though.  Order the Cash Money and you'll see what I mean.  (Unfortunately, that particular sandwich does not work well as a leftover.  Eat it all while you're there.)  Among the desserts, I highly recommend the red chile dark chocolate cheesecake.  I CAN'T STAND CHEESECAKE, and this is the one exception to that rule.  Even better than the food, however, and the ambiance, is the wait staff.  I've never met an unfriendly or sullen waiter there.  Even stingy tippers won't mind sparing a few dollars here for the fabulously congenial servers.  So go.  I dare you not to love it.  The Main Ingredient is worth it!",

They play awesome music. I think it's geared to a younger crowd but good for anyone really. Definitely has the hipster touch, but it's not overwhelming. Food is suuuper yummy. I usually stick with the hot sandwiches. The BLT is TO. DIE. FOR. The North Beach is also very good. If you're looking for very attentive service, you're looking at the wrong place, but if you're looking for a nice place to chat w friends and not be bothered by someone refilling your water glass every thirty seconds, then this is a great choice.",

    "text": "True to Downtown Phoenix, The Main Ingredient Ale House and Cafe is in the most unassuming area and you have to have an eagle eye while driving to find it.  Once I entered the house situated in the historic downtown neighborhood, I noticed the homey vibe of this converted house. The patio was lit with luminous lights and guests were enjoying a casual and cozy dining experience. While the patio was lively, the inside (although cozy), was pretty empty so we opted for the outdoor option -- especially since the weather was so nice that night.  Besides the atmosphere, the food at Main Ingredient is comfort food with a twist. I ordered a warm turkey \"jive\" sandwich which was on crunchy sourdough bread, with freshly slices of warm turkey and topped with jalapeno cream cheese. The sandwich was large, in charge and accompanied by a hefty field green salad. It was too big for me to finish more than half, but if ordered, this could be a good leftover meal. I also tried the mac and cheese with a kick of green chilies. It's listed as an appetizer but so hearty it can absolutely suffice for a meal. The artichoke heaven as a starter was hearty as well and you could easily share that with three or four others due to how rich it is. The beers to wash down the meal were tasty and they had some unique options to choose from.   So for a house-converted restaurant in Downtown Phoenix, it's worth trying out if you're in the area and once you leave the hustle of 7th street and sit at the Ale House, you'll forget that you are just off a busy city street.",

This is an old house that was previously a wine bar and is now The Main Ingredient.   Work your way up to the tiny bar if you can (it's usually full) and order a pint of one of the great brews they have on tap. Check out some of the thoughtful offerings on their wine list.  If you're hungry take a seat in the dinning room which has cool ambient light and usually good music playing. The atmosphere here is casual yet intimate all at the same time. There is also outdoor seating on the porch and in the front yard which is VERY pleasant during the spring and autumn months.  As with a lot of places, the menu is limited but what may be lacking in variety is compensated for with unique creations and quality ingredients. I'm a HUGE fan of the BLT and I LOVE the Coronado Coney. Really a great place for a casual night out.",

You would figure that after a disastrous take out salad, he would comp my meal and we'd be on our merry way. Nope. Instead, he made me drive all the way back to the restaurant because he needed to \"see with his own two eyes that my salad was frozen and wilted.\" Here's a tip for the starter manager: why don't you try inspecting the food before it actually goes out. That way it would have been your choice to either A) have your cook make it again or B) send out a dying plate and wait for the customer to call you back complaining. It would've saved me, your paying customer, an extra trip, anger and an empty stomach. It would saved you, Marvin, added stress from an unhappy customer. AND! It would have saved TMI from this bad review. #whohiredthiskid #management101",

We ate inside and it was stifling hot. This was a hot, muggy August night and it was more uncomfortable inside than out. Everyone was sweating just sitting there eating their dinner. 2. The food was boring, bland, and underwhelming. The jalepeno cream cheese appetizer was basically the same as a tub that you can get at walmart. The sandwiches were soggy, had way too much bread and way too little meat, and were really bland. 3. The atmosphere inside was bad. The music was ridiculously loud, which made everyone talk louder, which made the place just unbearably noisy. 4. Finally, when cars pull into several of the parking spots, their lights shine directly into  the main dining area and flood the very dark eating area in a bright light.  5. We aren't really holding this last one against them, but thought it worth mentioning in case it helps establish a pattern of bad service: they made a mistake and brought us someone else's order that was just similar enough to ours that we didn't notice until our first bites. I think this was just a random mix-up though and it wasn't a big deal.  In short, TMI just didn't live up to the hype.",

    "text": "The Meh Ingredient...  TMI caught my eye a few times as i drove down 7th st, so i made it a point to stop in and check out the joint.    A friend and I arrived after work.  It was about 6pm on a Thursday, so the happy hour crowd should be there.  Surprisingly enough, there were only 2 other tables of people there... This, my friends, is a bad sign.    But hey, i'm a craft beer fan, I love me some ALE... and this is an Ale House, so i'm about to be in heaven, right.... ahem... right??    Well, for an Ale House, the beer selection leaves a LOT to be desired.  First of all, if it's an Ale House, the staff should know a thing or two about beer, which they don't.  Don't go there and count on a good suggestion or description of the brews.  If you want a good beer selection, go to Roosevelt's or Lost Leaf.  TMI pales in comparison.    As for the food... we sampled the Olives, which are... well, olives.  But the olive selection at Postino's is far better.  Something about citrus zest in the olives just doesnt work for me.    Then we had the Pro-Pasto board. The menu advertises \"a sampler of meats, cheeses and veggies.\"  Well, I love a mystery, so we take the chance.  As we sipped our beers, the waitress arrived with the board of pro-pasto... she sets it down and walks away.  Wooooah, hold up sister!  What the hellzobah is even on this board?  How about a little rundown?  Oh, I see, this is a little quiz for me?  Cute!  Actually, this server has no idea what's on the board either.  Fortunately it was so unimpressive, that we could clearly make out the provolone & salami... glorious.  They don't know much about the beer, nor the food.   Off to a great start here.   It's advertised as a \"cafe\" and not a \"restaurant\", so i cant complain much about the weak menu (only offering sandwiches).  But if your staple is going to be the beer... then for heavens sake, have a better selection.  Not that the beers were bad, but they are available just about anywhere.  EVERYONE carries Four Peaks, and its not even a great brewery.  They did have an Oskar Blues brew from Lyons CO, but only the Gordon, no DPA.  Not even one Dogfish Head in a bottle.    If your taps are going to be lackluster... Id recommend these TMI people take a little class trip up to Total Wine on camelback and stock the fridge with some bottles of good stuff.  While yer up there, how about reading some lables and taking a class.  Learn a thing or two about beer... or at least about Ale's.    That's my $0.02. Not sorry aBOUT it.  Yer lucky my tip was more than that.",

    "text": "Very cool place nestled inside an older house where you dine in the living room, dining room and a bar area set off to the side.  It has a relaxing feel like you're hanging at a buddies house and the lighting is just perfect.  The music yesterday was unfortunately all over the place from rap to older musical icons but it was generally good.  I just don't like rap but that is a personal choice.  It might also be a bit loud for some as it was for me but only when more rap like tunes were on so again perhaps it is just my tastes.  As the evening progressed the music seemed to mellow a bit which was welcome but happy hour times seem to be a little too \"in yo face\" for me.  I've been here three times and usually gravitate to the BLT which has the best bacon on it I've ever had.  It is almost more like a soft jerky than bacon and the flavor of the sandwich is sublime.  The menu is quite diverse and everything is reasonably priced and well portioned.  I was not able to finish my BLT and I am a pretty big eater.    I found a new beer which was Stone's Delicious IPA which is aptly named.  Wow this is a good brew and unlike many of the Stone brews, does not knock you upside the head with a truckload of intense flavor.  It is well balanced IPA similar to a Deschutes fresh squeezed ipa or a Green Flash IPA.  Terrific!!!  Service was good though I have been outside when it was a little slow.  The bartender was on top of everything which was where we dined last night.  Parking can be a little crowded but considering the area there really are no solutions.  Overall a very cool place with a great vibe.",

We walked about 10 minutes from where we were staying and found the building dark and closed even though business hours were open. Fortunately, the sign on the door explained they were closed to give employees off for and extended mid-week 4th of July holiday which we thought was a class act. We found somewhere else to eat by TMI gets big up for taking care of their people. Thanks!",

Ponying up to the bar area I studying the food menu. Overwhelmed by the salad and sandwich options I opted for the soup of the day. (I was ravenous but had already consumed my bread components for the day.) I'm happy to report that soup is served waaaay faster than sandwiches (Ha ha ha! to my friends.) The mushrooms were large and the the soup was not a heavy bisque as I feared. My belly was fully.  If you're in the market for a sandwich the portions are HUGE. I'd go back for those. Patio space here is made for people watching. The bar, although cozy, is filled with charming regulars who clearly know each other well. One chap pointed out where the purse hooks were located. (I won't tell you  the borderline inappropriate joke shared. I  laughed. It's that kind of place.)   There's a television above the bar. Nothing obtrusive. My only surprise was being presented with an open bottle of Canada Dry seltzer when I asked for soda water. I'm not adverse for paying for it. I would have just appreciated being asked. Neat place to hang out at.",

I love the concept of this place being in an old home, and it's super cute inside.   The waitstaff were all super nice and helpful, the drinks were cheap and the food is pretty good. We ordered a meat and cheese plate appetizer and I had a salad, which was huge, for dinner.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, but I would probably suggest that you sit outside on the patio. The music was a bit loud and I felt like I had to talk louder than normal in order for people to hear me. I never do understand why restaurants will play music that is loud during dinner hours, but maybe that's just my opinion.",

    "text": "Old houses turned into hip and modern restaurants are just so cool, and The Main Ingredient Ale House & Cafe in central Phoenix is no exception. And it's hard to find a place in the States that serves Coca-Cola Light, so it gets points for that alone.  The dark and cozy eatery looks like it could be a romantic spot because the lighting inside is so low, but it's actually more casual in that it has sports broadcasting on a television in the dining room, and the bar is stocked with more than 30 beers from around the country and a variety of wines. This would be a great place to come before a game downtown if you want to chill out but still want to be a part of culture, since it's in the historic Coronado district.  The food menu at The Main Ingredient is simple and stocked with salads, sandwiches and American staples such as mac n' cheese. Everything that came out looked really high-quality, and my food was delicious.  First, I really enjoyed the chips and salsa ($4), with chips from yummy local La Tolteca and a medium heat salsa. The chips had the perfect texture and consistency, and the salsa had the right amount of spiciness. They definitely rivaled some of the best chips and salsa I've had at Mexican food restaurants, which is no surprise considering they're from La Tolteca.  For my entree, I got the griddled cheese with a  side of greens ($7). Instead of the sourdough it usually comes on, I got the sandwich on focaccia and added avocado to go along with the tomato. Be sure to pair your sandwiches with the greens rather than the kettle chips-I added a delicious lemon vinaigrette to the greens, and they were amazing. I could have eaten that salad as the whole meal, it was so delicious-if you don't like salads, this will make you a believer. The focaccia made the sandwich mouth-wateringly good, and for the price, I thought it was an excellent value.  Besides the tasty food, The Main Ingredient also features a little patio, and it's definitely a central Phoenix gem that's worth checking out.",

    "text": "I have to be honest, I for sure though I wasn't going to like this place. Silly reason, but the name totally put me off. When I heard The Main Ingredient Ale House And Cafe, I thought for sure it was just a beer & wine place as far as alcohol goes. I cannot have beer or red wine, so I avoid places that don't serve liquor if going out for a night of boozing, which this was. Liquor is not necessary for dinner alone, but this was Friday night boozing time. Also, the name is hard to remember, & that annoyed me as well. Nobody could remember the whole name, so people just kept calling it TMI...works for me.  Well folks, I am an asshole, and my reasons for assuming I wouldn't like this place were dumb. It's like therapy when you can admit stuff like that. OK, down to business, my actual review.  The have liquor!! OH yes people, they have a full bar. I had the vodka press, and it was a decent drink. It didn't blow me away, & the price was a bit high...but it was decent. Plus, they have a full bar. Oh, did i already say that?  Now the food, I got a salad called The Winner, and boy was it ever. I am trying to remember all the ingredients so I can do it justice. It had some wonderful mixed greens, Genoa salami, turkey, fresh mozzarella, kalamata olives, and I am sure there is something else I am forgetting. It was offered with a lemon dressing, but I dislike lemon dressing, so I went with their balsamic vinaigrette, which was great. This is the best salad I've had in ages. Most salads I like, but don't love...this one I love. I will say you should probably get another side of something with it, since a salad never completely fills you up. You know it's True. Who isn't hungry an hour later, if all they ate was a salad?  Finally the service, sad to say, but it was a bit of a mess. The owner readily admitted that she did not expect to get so busy so soon, & that she was understaffed. I have respect for her admitting that, & have faith that she'll fix it. I propose finding a better waiter than the guy who was working the outside area this past Friday night. He was nice, but you can tell waiting is not where his skill set lies. If a place is under staffed with great waiters, things go much more smoothly.  My friends also surprised me with a Shake Weight, because I've been talking about wanting one for a while now. Nobody in the place seemed to mind that we were all using & passing around a Shake Weight. So feel free to bring your Shake Weight here when you & your friends come out too.  After the kinks are worked out, I think this place will be fantastic. I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Main Ingredient, you're hip, you're trendy, and if you were a celebrity, I'd have a crush on you.      Considering this restaurant is a renovated house in Phoenix, I already give it cool factor points. It's cozy and inviting, with the open floor plan and arched entry ways of a cool ranch house. The bar is open on the left hand side and the seating goes throughout two rooms. The patio area is spacious and offers most of the seating here, but it is worth it. There are fire pits, pretty lights and lots of gorgeous open Arizona air.           We sat near the door so I could people watch and were promptly greeted by our waitress. She brought us water quickly and gave us time going through the menu. We ordered the Artichoke Heaven Appetizer, along with our beers--where I first met my Four Peaks Peach beer that I'm in love with. Since I have been recovering from the flu (thanks Midwest!) I decided  to try the much loved Griddled Cheese and butternut squash soup for my side.       The Aritchoke Heaven--aka Aritchoke Dip--was tasty, it was chunkier and came with house made tortilla chips. They were crunchy, a little salty, but very well made. My Griddled Cheese was grilled cheese mastery. Layered with Havarti, Muenstar and Chedder cheese along with tomato slices made this sourdough sammy one tasty treat. My soup was flavorful and wasn't too thick--it was a nice side for my sandwich, although I wish I had had Tomato Basil soup to go with it!            This place is the bombdotcom",

With all the other stupidly delicious options there are in this part of town I feel there are a few things they could do to step it up a little bit. The service for one. It hasn't been awful but its definitely been mediocre whenever I've been. They have tons of seating and a great patio. Anytime we go the patio looks enticing but the majority of the time my man and I don't want to sit by someone who is smoking while we eat. Nothing against smokers! I just don't want to inhale that while I'm eating.   The salads have been killer every time I go but with that being said, I only order their salads because I feel like there is nothing else on the menu I'd really want. I've ordered The Beet Salad and The Baby Bleu. Both of which were tasty and huge. If it means anything at all, my man loves this place. He has ordered the grilled cheese and the veggie quesadilla and loved both. The only time I'd go here is if my boyfriend wants it. But hey, at least i'm never unsatisfied right?",

The patio is awesome and usually full but even if that's the case and you're stuck sitting inside, it's inviting and cozy especially at night with the lights turned down and the candles lit.   Mac & Cheese...my arch nemesis and one food that's been my fav from when I was 5. TMI nails it. So yummy and with the cracker/bread on top of it, adds a nice texture and taste. The BLT with avocado is delicious..so simple but the ingredients are fresh and you can't go wrong with chips and a pickle slice.  TMI's beer list is solid and I've yet to try the wine but when it's basically down the street, I don't have to think of too many excuses to get back for the service and the atmosphere.   By far one of my favorite places!",

There are certainly choices, but they're not extensive.  *The margaritas are not good at all. Given that their Bloody Marys are great and I've had other good mixed drinks there, they would do well to invest in some fresh squeezed juice for their cocktails.  Other than that, there are a lot of things I really like about this place. First, I think the vegetarian items I have had are delicious. The veggie sandwich is done really well with great bread and the grilled cheese has the perfect combination of muenster, havarti and cheddar. Perhaps the biggest standout is Sophie's Salad, marrying crunchy pine nuts and red onions with fresh mozzarella and basil. Delicious!  I also adore the patio. It's a great size with lots of tables and just feels picturesque in front of the old house (even though 7th Street is right there). What a great place to spend a cold night or a breezy spring day. The only time it's not great is in the middle of the summer (as there are no misters). I wish that more of the old homes in the Coronado District had nice, open front patio areas.  Last but not least, the service has always been good the few times I've been. No one has been overly attentive but my needs have always been met.",

The Main Ingredient definitely lived up to my expectations. The food is delicious, the ambiance is great, and the service is fast.  The patio is optimal for a date or hangout with friends. Since it was full, though, my date and I instead enjoyed relaxing couch seating inside. Also a good choice, although we felt a bit short since we were sitting across from a few hightop tables. :)  As this was my first visit, I've only tried a few things on the menu. But I can tell you that the artichoke dip is the best I've ever had. And the Jive Turkey sandwich is delicious. So is the lemonade--they offer free refills even though it's clearly homemade. Yum!    With so many interesting sandwich combinations, I'm excited to go back and sample more items. I'd also love to bring some vegetarian friends--they had quite a few tasty looking meat-free options.   My only complaint is that our waitress wasn't the friendliest. She wasn't rude, just seemed disinterested.  The rest of the staff, however, was really polite.  I could also forsee complaints arising from other patrons about the lack of parking available, but my date and I didn't mind walking off a few artichoke dip calories on the way back to the car.",

The only place to sit, unfortunately, was inside, right in the corner beneath a speaker. My husband was sitting 2 feet away and I could not hear him speak. I also had a hard time hearing our server.  The music was mostly rap. It had the feeling of being next to a booming bass at a frat party. 2) I suppose it was tied to the music, but the ambience was more akin to an alehouse than a real restaurant.  3) Service was spotty and not very professional. After telling our waitress we needed more time to think about what to order, we waited 10 full minutes before we saw her again, and I had pretty much decided right after she left what I had wanted. Any longer and I think we would have left.  Again, I love and support all local Phoenix places, but I was highly dissapointed. The redeeming things, that would push me more towards a 2.5-star review if possible, were that our sandwiches were good (the griddled cheese and the acapulco) , and the patio looked much nicer to sit on. However, we won't be back to find out if it is or not.",

The patio is perfect in the evenings or when the temps cool down! We've always had pretty good service here, but the last few times we've gone we've had outstanding service from Will! Our second time at one of his tables he even remembered what we had to drink on our previous visit! Needless to say we were pretty impressed with his memory and are happy to have him taking care of us when we hang out here (especially since he introduced me to the chili cheese dogs on Saturdays)!   You basically cannot go wrong with anything on the menu... I've tried just about everything, but always find myself rotating between the Coney dog, the RB & C (roast beef and cheddar with a creamy horseradish sauce), and the cheesesteak (SO GOOD)! The mac and cheese is also incredible, and filling enough to be an entire meal! This is a MUST TRY if you've never been!",

TMI also has the best Happy Hour in town on Mondays.  If you're just there for drinks with a friend, grab the tiny sofa! If you're there with a bunch of friends, snag an outside patio table; it's casual and the best place to have conversation.

Only 2 cons in my opinion, parking on the street if there is no where else to park and smelling like the restaurant( if you decide to sit inside) once you leave, but worth it for the awesome food? A must try!",

I was lucky to have had the first opportunity to go there in Feb of this year when the weather was still really nice, not scorching hot, so I was able to enjoy there nice big outdoor patio. I went there after work on a weekday and was surprised to see as many people there as I did.. The atmosphere was amazing super laid back perfect for catching up with an old friend which I was. They had the perfect chill music playing in the background to really complete the homely atmosphere.   Good eats and drinks. I noticed they not only did they have a lot of local beers but a full bar as well which I love since I don't really drink beer. The service was good but a little on the slower side which for that day since I was catching up with an friend it worked out. From all the reviews it seems like you really can't go wrong with anything you order but I can personally vouch for the The Acapulco Cheese steak, deli-sh.   Great spot can't wait to go back. It's hard to find a truly cool spot with a great vibe.",

Having food in the patio feel like your'e having a meal at your grandma's house.  The salsa and chip appetizer is really good. Mac and cheese was good in the beginning but after a few bite, it was too cheesy and creamy that you'll be too full to eat anything else. Next time I come back, I want the inside setting where it is lit with candles and give a cozy warm light",

Anyplace that I can walk home from after a few drinks and also provides my dog with her own drink deserves 5 stars ;) And we both get exercised which is a plus!  But really, the sandwiches are delicious (by now, I've eaten most of them which is why I wish they'd update!), the beers are good, service is fine (by myself, with a group, with my dog, without my dog- I've never been ignored) and the ambiance is chill (the constant hip-hop music seems a bit incongruous with the 'image' of the place but as I like the music they play, no complaints). There's not too much more to ask for when all you want to do is relax with your pooch or some friends- or both!  I should probably stop by with more purpose to take advantage of happy hour/daily deals. If I could give them higher than 5 stars, I totally would!  Other stuff: - this is a SUPER dog-friendly patio (ex. one night, my half of the patio had 5 dogs total) - keep in mind that it is an ale house and cafe NOT a restaurant - a review or two mentioned how dogs got better service than their kids ... they get a bowl of water, and though they're pretty nice bowls, they are not an entirely separate menu - if you can't find parking in the parking lot, there's plenty of (free) street parking",

Prices are super reasonable and the food is tasty, just a great place to hang out and relax.  I ordered the Sonoran White Chocolate Ale but found it way too sweet so I got the Magic Hat for my second drink and was much happier.   We loved the artichoke and cheese dip. My fiance ordered the cheesesteak which he ended up having to share with me since my sandwich wasn't any good. But the cheesesteak was delish. I ordered the roast beef sandwich but unfortunately it was so dry and overcooked that it wasn't even edible. The server took one look at it and took it off our bill. No big deal, overall I was still very happy with this place.  I can't wait to go back and try some other things -- mac & cheese, tmi toast, tacos and their salads. Yum!",

I ordered the BLT with field greens as my side.  I liked that the salad wasn't drenched in dressing. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was some kind of herb or something they put in there.  Now for the best part, the sandwich! It had lots of thick-sliced bacon strips in it, avocado slices, tomato, lettuce, and just the right amount of chipotle mayo. I liked that they didn't slather the mayo on, so it wasn't oozing out the sides of the sandwich when I bit down.  Even though I was moderately full after eating half the sandwich, I devoured the whole thing.  I'm looking forward to when I can come back again and try something else! My coworker ordered the sanwich with prosciutto and cheese that also looked delicious.",

They had Grand Rapids beer which is exciting since that is where we are from!  Service was okay. We were there early Saturday afternoon and they seemed to be under staffed. We paid on two checks and the server switched our cards. The bills differed by about $20. The group decided it wasn't worth changing (we would pay them back later) we let her know about the mistake, but let her know we didn't want it changed just letting her know so she didn't make the same mistake again. She walked away shaking her head and mumbling to herself. I approached her about it and she apologized and explained it was a misunderstanding. This was reassuring, but we aren't sure we will be returning.",

I had not heard of this restaurant before but I checked out the menu online and thought it would be good for lunch. When I pulled in I easily found a parking space in their lot and walked in.  I was offered a great space on their shaded patio.  After sitting down we were greeted by the owner, Ron (Great guy btw) and he told us some of his favorite menu items and the daily special.  Shortly after, our server came to take our drink order.  We order a couple beers and some water.  After just a couple minutes she returned with our beverages and took our food order.  I ordered the BLT (recommended by the owner) with the soup of the day (brie and mushroom) and my friend ordered the RBC (Roast Beef and Cheese) with a side salad. We sipped our beers and maybe 10 minutes passed till our food arrived.  It looked delicious and tasted even better.  The BLT had nice thick cut bacon, heirloom tomatoes, crisp lettuce and an amazing sauce.  The bread was toasted perfectly as well.  I quickly devoured my sandwich and moved to the soup which was quite tasty.  The mushroom flavor really came through but was not overpowering, the perfect balance. After we finished our meals the server brought our bill (split upon our request), processed our payments quickly, and we left very satisfied. If you live in the downtown Phoenix area or are ever in the area, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  I lived in Phoenix for years and wish I would have heard of it back then!",

We walked in to what I felt was a frat house with a whole bunch of tables. There was so many people, I was overwhelmed and I didn't know how to guide myself to a seat or a host.   I see a girl standing to what seemed to be a waitress and she tells me it is open seating. Ok... It looks like there was one small table in the corner for two and I take it. Right away, I hated it! The sun was beaming through the window and I can feel myself get hotter and sweatier as I wait for some hospitality. A guy drops off menus and doesn't say one word. The corner felt so dirty, there were at least three or four flys nesting on the windows, and I was very uncomfortable.  I look over the menu and the drink menu is pretty good but the food menu is really limited. While waiting, we hear either rap or rock music blaring, but it seemed like the speakers were blown. The waitress finally arrives and I order the Peach Bellini, the TMI toast and the artichoke dip. Happy hour prices are for drinks only - bummer...  The appetizers arrived at least five minutes before our drinks which I thought was weird - shouldn't the drinks come first? The artichoke and toast was nothing great and the drink was super strong!! Am I at a college party? I sure feel like I'm at one. There was no A/C on and there was a fan going so it was pretty muggy.  Anyway, the flys could not stop bugging us especially since our appetizers arrived and by that time with two sips of my drink, I wanted to head out the door. I didn't even want to wait for the waitress to come back to order the popular sandwiches.   We finally see our waitress, ask for our check, paid and never looked back.",

The meat and cheese plate was overpriced and featured some of the most boring cheese I've ever eaten in my life.  My friend could not finish his sandwich-he said the bread was tough and chewy and tasted like it had been microwaved.  My cobb salad was pretty blase-unripe tomatoes and thinly sliced sandwich turkey that tasted like the inside of a refrigerator. Don't go here for the food, you will be disappointed.",

We split a cup of olives and a salad - and the sizes were terrific, the pours were generous and the beer was realy yummy (according to my fiance, as I don't drink that stuff!)  The atmosphere was classy, but very relaxed - he was in tie dye, jeans and a nice leather jacket, and I was in a skort and a t-shirt with a vest (straight from my son's field trip to Tucson.)  We felt \"right at home\" and it was nice to be able to have a quick, somewhat romantic, drink before parting for our Friday evening.   I am not sure what would have given it a 5...maybe just worried still about the newness, the lack of organization, the who ambience wasn't quite up to par with my favorite haunts (SENS, Rokerij, Hana, 4Peaks, Roosevelt, etc.)  - but it's something I am going to keep trying because this place has so much potential - and we just weren't HUGE LisaG fans...so we are excited to see the patio and the new vibe.  Good LUCK!",

We ended up at The Main Ingredient by accident, but turned out to be a pleasant surprise! We had the chips and salsa (very tasty), the Jive Turkey sandwich, and the Griddled Cheese. Both sandwiches were delicious! The house dressing was pretty amazing too. Since it's an ale house, we tried the wild raspberry beer and a reisling wine. Both very enjoyable! Our waitress, the guy who sat us, and even the busser were super nice and helpful with drink selections. As I write this, I'm beginning to crave a grilled cheese... Definitely want to go back, since it sounds like some smokin' good deals at Happy Hour too!",

I don't often get excited about salads but I was pleasantly surprised at the generous portion. It was dressed better than me and LOADED with artichokes, tomatoes, toasted pine nuts and basil.  There was no skimping on toppings or fishing through the greens for the goods, every bite was magic in my mouth.   I will be craving that salad in the near future and they've got a Veggie sandwich that I'd like to try as well. Can't wait to go back!",

I had never heard of it &  was just driving by on my way to do some shopping at MacAlpines. I saw the full outdoor patio & all of the bicycles caught my eye. I couldn't help myself. I decided to check out the menu & have a cold one. After checking the menu I decided to try the RB & C & actually exclaimed aloud \"holy sh** that's great!\" while holding down a spot at the bar. As usual my potty mouth was overheard (sad face) but it was appreciated by the best lady behind the bar. I'm thinking she was an owner/manager because she thanked me for the compliment. Gotta love that someone appreciated my compliments to the chef/menu. How often does that happen? This was a well deserved compliment. I will be back to The Main Ingredient & soon. I want to try the Cash Money & Coronado Coney. I wish I lived closer so I could ride my cruiser over like the rest of the lucky locals. See ya soon Main Ingredient.",

The place is really cute, it kind of feels like you're in someone's house. We sat on a couch with a low table. We decided to split the jive turkey and the goat salad. I really liked the turkey sandwich, but my dad didn't care for it. I liked the jalapeno cream cheese and the bread was also really good. The salad I thought was not that great, but my dad really liked it. I am a goat cheese fan and I love strawberries in salad. I think maybe the dressing was the problem or the pistachios. Either way, I thought it would taste a lot better than it did. Overall this place was good and I like the decor, but I don't know if I would make the trip down there again.",

My boyfriend had the Jive Turkey sandwich that was incredible as well!

I ordered the mac n cheese and the jive turkey with the field green salad. Whoever said get the salad - well done! It was fabulous and the dressing was perfect. Now.. my eyes were clearly bigger than my stomach and I took a nibble of everything and it was delightful.   Bonus was the real hip-hop piping in the background. I don't know if that was someone's playlist or what, but I want it!   A few things to note: When you walk in - it's a bit overwhelming to be a renovated house turned restaurant. You don't know should you sit, stand, where is the bathroom, repeat. However, I was \"intercepted\" by super friendly folks who pointed me around and put some menus down to hold a seat for me! There was only one bartender when I was there and while he was working he was slammed. So be patient if it takes a few minutes to get your drink. Lastly, parking is nightmarish. You will come out better just parking in the residential area.. as long as you don't block a driveway you should be okay.",

I asked the server, Jen, if they had anything vegan.  Her response was, \"no.\"  One word, and cold.  Okay.  Instead of trying to order/modify something (like the PBJ or veggie sandwich, or even chips and salsa), I decided to just not eat because I wasn't going to give you a dime extra.  So Jen, if you're wondering why you got a $2 tip versus nothing, it's because my wife decided to grab the check before I could, and I'm normally a 25% tipper.  Jen couldn't get us out of there fast enough.  No proactivity on the birthday.  \"Any dessert?\"  I remember bending over backwards as a server.  The laziness I see now is pathetic.  Thanks for ruining my wife's birthday.  Oh, and the cigarette smokers on the patio as you walk in the front door....classy.",

I'm not even trying to be one of those types of people, you know buzz-killy fuddy-duddy- swear I'm cool, but twice I have come in and hip hop was blaring so loudly it hurt my ears and I had to leave- there was no way I could communicate with the person I was out eating with.   Luckily it was not like that the last time- I really liked the young lady bartender that was working as well. I can't remember her name- I think she was from Ohio or something. She was really nice and friendly. The service was much better last visit. I have been here before- sitting right at the tiny bar and never acknowledged, so that was a nice change of pace.",

    "text": "We love going to this restaurant. It's in a little renovated historic house and it just feels nice. They have a sweet patio too. Their food is very good. I always get the BLT sandwich. It's not an ordinary BLT. It has the BEST bacon ever, and lots of lettuce, tomato, avocado, and super thinly sliced onion...just a bit. And it has a nice chipotle mayonnaise. This thing is addictive. I never get anything else because I know I'll be thinking of it while eating something else. My family says the mac and cheese is great and also the pork chili. On Mondays, their happy hour is all day. Last night I had the nicest glass of Cabernet, for an insanely reasonable price, and my husband had a tasty beer that was on tap. The service is always good, and the people always very nice.",

After getting suckered into a lunch with the guys from work, we flipped a coin and ended up aimed from The Main Ingredient. Let me tell you, there are worse places to end up for lunch. I wasn't sure how, but the coin was flipped between, Main Ingredient, Cartel, AND Upper Crust. I didn't realize there were 3 sides to a coin before, but apparently there is.   I was torn between the Mac & Cheese and the the Red Goat. After some convincing my buddies and the waitress helped me land on the Mac & Cheese. Although, you can't really compare apples to apples here, being that the Red Goat is a salad and the Mac & Cheese is; well, Mac & Cheese, I really was torn. Let me tell you now, this was the beginning of the end for me, and I haven't looked back since. After that first bite I made an executive decision; I would be taking a vacation from my normal diet. Don't worry diet, we'll get back together someday soon, just not today and likely not tomorrow either.  The Mac & Cheese here was like a lasagne of good ol' hometown delicious cheesy goodness, expecting to see a piled scoop of cheesy noodles, I was pleasantly surprised! Cooked with loads of cheddar cheese and topped with green chile, this was pure Mac & Cheese bliss.  In real downtown Phoenix fashion, Main Ingredient is tucked into a renovated home, redone to give that home / cafe feel. Many of their dishes are served with a crispy crusted soft and extremely tasty bread and on a side note, ask them for a side of olive oil for dipping it in. Better for you than butter and in my opinion better tasting, and it adds a little European charm.   Here's hoping your next coin flip ends all you up at Main Ingredient. Happy Dining Yelpers!",

I went again yesterday, for lunch with my son, mom, and brother.   My mom and I both had the Acapulco Cheesesteak. Its got roast beef, some kind of Mexican cheese, red peppers, onions, and chipotle sauce! The sandwich was so good. Rich. Flavorful. Stacked. Fillings falling out of the sandwich! It came with a \"salad\" on the side. It was some lettuce with dressing on it. The balsamic was really good though.   My brother had the Sheridan. Which was also stacked with turkey, salami, cheese lettuce, tomato and some spicy mustard. My brother can put down some grub but he was only able to finish half of his sandwich and half his side of kettle chips.   Alisa was our server and she was really sweet and helpful. She was super with my son. Its always cute to watch my 7 year old flirt with a waitress haha. Okay so the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because I didn't go here alone. Based on the opinions of the company I was with saying that our server should have come around more I have to drop one. I think if our table as a whole had been 100% satisfied with the service it would be 5 stars.   I love that the soda pop comes out in bottles with an ice filled glass to kind of self serve. My son kept his bottle.  I have also had the Jive Turkey sandwich from here which has turkey breast, tomato and lettuce with this amazing jalapeno cream cheese. The Mindy's Mac & Cheese is amazing also! My son had the quesadilla from here which is pricey for what it is considering he orders it plain, but the cheese is yummy and the rest of the food makes it totally worth it! Plus it comes with a side of cream cheese, guacamole, and salsa.   We four way split the Triple Chocolate Brownie for desert and seeing as how none of us could finish our plates it was just enough!   This place will always be on my list of go-to restaurants in CenPho!  Xx, Reesie",

The bar is small but packed with regulars and a full bar of taps for local and artisanal beers, the inside dining area has plenty of seating, cool & fun music and walls adorned with art featuring local artists.   The cocktails were delicious! TMI Lemonade, is sneaky and dangerous while disguised as a refreshing cranberry & lemonade delight. The food! OMG...the best BLT I have EVER had! Piled high w pork underbelly bacon, fresh and tender lettuce, grilled bread and fresh sweet tomatoes...add on avocado and thinly sliced red onion and a flavor explosion happens in your mouth!  The tuna was creamy fresh and tasty against freshly baked bread.   All in all, a great restaurant featuring fresh ingredients, great atmosphere and superb beers and cocktails!

The parking lot a little small so you may need to park in a nearby residential side street. Inside is full of rustic charm complete with dark wood floors and brick fireplace. The drinks menu has a small but interesting selection of draft beers and a large number of bottled or canned brews. There is also a selection of wines and cocktails. The food is a mix of stews, soups, and quirky sandwiches. The Cash Money sandwich is particularly good and I would highly recommend it.

That is a tragically terrible name.\" Is a direct quote from somewhere in the middle of a conversation I had with my good friend Julia T about the new establishment in the old Lisa G's location. Then after arriving: \"Julia, they serve sandwiches and salads. Nothing here even has a goddamned main ingredient.\"  But ya know what? The new kid aint so bad! My sandwich (the calvano) seriously good,like SERIOUSLY, and remember I didn't want to like it at all. I also had a bite of the tuna melt and it was awesome as well.

It is a low-key house-turned bar that serves solid food executed extremely well, alongside beer and wine that has obviously been selected with care by fans of things that taste good.  The sandwiches here are really a reminder about how good a sandwich can be, flirting with the platonic ideal in sandwich-ness.  The mac n' cheese is just like mom made it, baked and crusty and rich.  The salads are simple and delicious.  Happy hour is really generous - $2.50 draught beers and $4 selected glasses of wine.  The tap beer selection is better than anywhere else in downtown Phoenix, excepting the Roosevelt, which is very un-hang-outable.  I've sipped three or four glasses of other people's wines, and the wine selection is really great as well.  Best of all, kind of like Casey Moore's in Tempe, the bar is starting to act as a great place to see the diversity of folks who live in the Coronado and Roosevelt neighborhoods.",

The service has always been poor, but that has become expected. It takes a long time to be greeted, and expect your glass to be empty for awhile before they come around to offer you another. The waitress always seems to be rude and acts like you are bothering her. Other than that, I recommend it! It's in a cute Phoenix historic house and they place cool music :)",

    "text": "I have had the pleasure of hitting up The Main Ingredient for both food and drinks and have been impressed each time.  Now that summer has evaporated, the True potential of their patio has begun to emerge.  Their location on 7th Street is not dazzling, but the place is tucked back enough from the street to allow the old-school hip hop music, low hanging light-studded trees, and candle-lit tables to work their magic.  There is also a bench with a large barrel for a table that my friend noticed only at the end of our meal that if available, must be snagged for use.  The inside of TMI might even have better atmosphere which feels warm and luscious with the lights dimmed and candles everywhere.  Their beer selection is extensive and they carry one of my favorite brews (Agave Wheat).  The food menu is short, but everything is generally tasty, specifically the mac and cheese with the green chiles.  I'd knock the menu only for its spareness.  I'd like to see a few more interesting additions to their food selection, but there really is no place I would rather go to on a random night of the week at 9pm for a drink.",

    "text": "I have been awaiting TMI to open for months.  I was a regular at Lisa G, and finally, Matt and Courtney have made me happy by opening up shop.  Today was opening day, and despite finding anyone awesome enough to attend with me, I decided to pull my usual Lisa G style of going solo.  I'm so glad that I did as I met a few great neighbors and felt super at home.  8 brews on draft- all from the West Side of the country.  A few Four Peaks, and then a house beer- The Main Ale (Yes, TMI!).  I had the Main Ale, Four Peaks Hefe and the Blonde Ale tonight- all good.  I will probably stick to the TMI ale and Four Peaks in the future.  In addition, they have the core boozy bases- I ended up with some obscure AZ brewed Wildberry vodka press that made me happy that I believe in night caps.    I ordered the mac and cheese for dinner.  This apparently is a side dish that Matt's sister makes for all of their families big holiday gatherings, that they turned into a whole dish with green chiles.  Cheesy and spicy?  It is like Matt knew me before he knew me to make this awesome dish.  SOLD.  Another cool note:  Matt's mom has recently went Vegan so he is a bit more aware of the world and people who eat a bit differently.  That being said, he has a veggie panini on the menu that can be made vegan- I will try it within a week but I'm just glad he has made it an option.    I met a bunch of my neighbors, drank a bunch of good beer, had a cheesy dinner with a kick and fell in love all at that same moment.  Yep, pretty sure my regular status at this venue is going to stick.",

However, I've made way for TMI to fill the void and as the song goes, My Heart Will Go On.  The charming Sheridan bungalow takes on a new life with a new menu, new decor, new staff and a  great experience for you to enjoy.    The ambiance is perfect if you are, as I am, one for dim lit places that play old school/neo-soul/hip hop beats while chilling with a group of friends. The interior space is relaxed and the furniture very comfy.   The Drink Menu has something for everyone. Wine, draft, maybe a cocktail. My choice, the Four Peaks Hefe and a sip of a friend's dirty martini.     The menu options are great and the prices even better. Although I only had the soup, I snuck a bite of Bacon's grilled cheese sandwich and Ayesha's mac & cheese. Both were amazing and I can't wait to go back for more. The staff was extremely friendly and timely even though the place was bustling. Our table had 11 people on separate checks but our server didn't even bat an eye. Cash out, easy breezy!   Thanks TMI, I'm a fan.",

HH has 2.50 drafts and they have about 8-10 diff choices so you can't go wrong, they'll have something you like.   It's also like a house-bar, which is neat because it makes you feel at home.

The food on the other hand I am not a huge fan of.  It is alright, that is it, nothing I have tried has ever made me ecstatic.  The mac and cheese, at least the one piece I got, was just a chunk from the corner of the pan.  It was dry, it was overcooked, it was not the best. I prefer something creamier and not so dense.  Really good mac and cheese needs to be nurtured into perfection.  The different ingredients added at different times, not mixed together all at once and put into a pan to bake.  I felt like I got the last smidge out of a pan that was sitting under the warmer.  Another appetizer I had was the spinach dip which was ok but the portion was exceedingly small compared to the huge mound of chips.  Let's just make it a bit more even please.  I will continue to go here, but probably just to meet friends for a drink or two.",

I am giving them a so so rating because the service is usual less than good and the food is not the best.  The atmosphere and drinks are fantastic.  It is a great place to go hang out and have a beer with friends but I would skip it for dinner.  I have tried a variety of things on the menu and have found them either extremely average or below average in taste.  I am really surprised by all the great reviews of the food because there are many many better food options in the neighborhood.  Only one out of the 4-5 times I have been there has the service been decent.  The other times it has taken forever to even be acknowledged and even longer to get a drink.",

I'd been to this location a few times when it was Lisa G.'s, and I'm happy to report that MI is superior (I always found Lisa G.'s a little pretentious and overpriced).   Sandwiches are great - the Jive Turkey and Tuna sandwiches are delicious and very flavorful - and the service is excellent! I came in with a group of 5 co-workers on our lunch break and there weren't any tables available for our party but the waitress was really nice and apologetic and told us she would seat us soon. She took our orders in advance because we were in a bit of a hurry and seated us within a few minutes. She offered to give us separate checks and brought them shortly after our food arrived; of course, saying \"no rush,\" but just trying to be helpful because we were pressed for time. Finally, a restaurant that doesn't act like it's the hugest hassle in the world to provide separate checks! It's a reality of modern dining and I love it when restaurants don't treat you like a pariah for requesting your own ticket. It makes things so much less awkward/complicated when you're out for a quick bite to eat with friends or coworkers.  Definitely check out the Main Ingredient next time you're looking for good food and service in a cute, cozy environment.",

    "text": "Went to TMI--ha ha... I still think the acronym is funny--yesterday with a friend for lunch and we both were pretty content with our experience and orders. She had a salad with pistachios and goat cheese and I had The Sheridan, a turkey/salami sandwich, hold the mustard, light on the mayo. REALLY good.... especially due to the salami... it makes you notice it--and happily so--in every bite...and I have to admit, I am particular about salami!  When we ordered, our waitress forgot to ask if I wanted chips or salad and I got the salad when she returned with our orders... I politely mentioned that I had wanted chips and she didn't even question... just brought me the chips--that's good service in my book! I see what other yelpers mean by the side salad just being lettuce... my friend and I quite liked the dressing and since I also had chips free of charge, I guess I didn't feel the emptiness other yelpers felt about it. In the end I agree, a salad should have a couple more ingredients to call itself a salad. C'mon, just a few tomatoes, maybe some green onions or nuts of some sort...  The chips were very fresh and I have a feeling their made fresh on site... and if not, they definitely fooled me! And, back to my sandwich... I had been discussing eating at Culvers and thinking the burger was alright but that in the end I don't care for burgers unless you put The Fez in front of it. Happily, when our order arrived, I noticed that the shape of the panini style sandwich was much like the longer length of bread that Fez uses for their burgers... each side of sandwich truly looked like a meal per...so, after my morning hike I'm going to have the other half for breakfast. Leftovers hold a \"no time like the present\" status, no matter what kind of meal they are in my house because they also hold the \"definitely going to expire soon\" unwritten label on them. And heck, sometimes I feel like breaking stereotypes and labels much like musicians do when they describe their music. Don't try to pigeonhole a meal... if it's tasty and good, why should it only be eaten or desired at certain times of day? But I digress.  So in the end, if you're in the mood for sandwiches, I feel TMI is a worthy competitor for your sandwiching desires! The ambiance is still Lisa G esque and I love their local pride... there was a painting above the mantle of the Phoenix symbol with a silhouette of the city below it... reminded me of the phrase \"Love Phoenix or leave Phoenix\" and made me happy to be dining in one of our local establishments.",

I will go back again and if I have a great dish, I will change my vote to 5 stars (and down to 3 if the dish is so-so).",

    "text": "Met up with some friends here after work last week.   1) We had great service; our waiter seemed very knowledgeable about the beers on tap and made a few recommendations to a friend of ours who is not a big \"gourmet\" beer drinker. We also had a nice exchange with the bartender.  2) How anyone can say they don't have a good selection of beers must not have gotten past their counting lessons in the 1st grade.  They have 8 beers on tap (which are only $2.50 a pop at happy hour--score!) and another 22 in bottles/cans. That's 30. Only two of which are your standard crappy Budweiser/Miller variety. Um, poor beer selection? If you want Heineken or Coors Light, go elsewhere.  3) We sampled a few menu items: the green chile artichoke dip served with La Tolteca chips--awesomely cheesy. I had the Calvano sandwich and the hubby had the Jive Turkey (ordered just because he liked the name). Both were delicious. Friends that were with us loved their food choices as well.  We all agreed it was a great place to chill out and have beers and snacks on the patio. We'll be back.",

    "text": "After being a frequenter of Carly's for the past couple of years, I'd gotten used to sandwiches that were tasty, but lacking filler, and a happy hour that only consisted of a dollar off beers. Womp womp. The area was in need of a good sandwich and salad shop with tasty beers and wines to rival it. So you can imagine my excitement when this place opened up... I love their homegrown feel and it is in the great Coronado neighborhood that I grew up in and am very proud of :) It is also officially the reason I don't really go to Carly's anymore... The Happy Hour features $2.50 drafts, aka, they offer danger :) The staff is friendly, the service is good, the menu ranges around $6-$9, yet features sandwiches with REAL ingredients on them. The Calvano, oh Mama mia! This New York-sized sandwich just makes my mouth water even thinking about it. I didn't know I loved sopressata before this sandwich existed. I always order some extra balsamic with my salad so that I can also add a little to the sandwich. Also, Mac and Cheese with EXTRA hatch chiles is the way to go for some extra tasty flavor. The salads are HUGE and DELIGHTFUL. Finally, three more words to sell you: Jalapeno cream cheese. Yes please, all over. It is featured on the TMI Toast and the Jive Turkey sandwich. They serve their food until midnight on the weekends for some late-night eats. The ambiance, flavor, the relaxed, yet on-it staff are the total package and a great addition to the neighborhood.",

I'm pretty sure this sandwich has been life changing because I haven't looked at bacon the same way since I had this sandwich.   They use tender belly bacon and cook it to crispy perfection. The BLT is of course compiled of bacon, lettuce and tomatoes, but they add a chipotle mayo, avocado and red onions on sourdough bread. They give you the option of a lightly dressed greens or chips with a pickle. I actually found out about this place on the PBS show, Check Please Arizona in 2013. I remember a lady on the show talking about how good her BLT was and I thought to myself, how good can a BLT be? Apparently really good since my husband and I have been repeat customers for 4 years now.   If you are pretty hungry, I would suggest the Artichoke Heaven for an appetizer. The chips are a little crispy, but the dip is indeed heavenly.",

They got the grilled cheese and the tuna sandwich and both liked theirs. I had to go with the Courtney Cobb (because duh, my name is Courtney). I'm not a fan of bleu cheese and without even asking, our waitress asked if I wanted to sub it with something else. The portion was generous and everything included had a good serving of each, it was a pretty looking salad. My boyfriend got a sandwich that the server recommended (can't remember the name) and he really likes it. It did take a while for the server to be able to come over to our table as there were about 8 families/couples at other tables and she appeared to be the only server. The only bummer is that we were very hungry and had to wait about 30 minutes for our food which was just 3 sandwiches and a salad, so nothing too hard considering how long it took. When the server brought over our food she did acknowledge how long the food took without us initiating any comments about it. The parking lot is small as it is shared with a few other business and restaurants, but there is parking in the neighborhood. It has creaky wood floors giving it that old house feeling. The bathroom could use a deep cleaning as around the sink was filthy.",

I'll start off with the amazing awesomeness- Happy Hour!  All day Happy Hour on Monday and I believe 11am-6pm Tuesday-Sunday.  All cocktails from the bar are half off ($4 Crown on the rocks).  They have a small but solid selection of craft beers on draft, those are priced at $2.50 on happy hour, so money!!  I've frequented The Main Ingredient multiple times, and I've been hooked on Courtney's Cobb Salad ($10)!!  It's the only entree I've ordered each and every trip, it's so damn good, just order it and thank me later!!  The home made ranch dressing is the reals, it's so mouth watering and really elevates the salad to the next level.  The TMI toast was good, but I think the toast was a little to crispy.  The delicious jalapeno spread would be more enjoyable with something a little less crunchy in my humble opinion, still enjoyable nonetheless.  The outdoor, dog friendly patio is also what makes The Main Ingredient so pleasant.  If you're in the area or looking for a nice spot to grab a few drinks and enjoy some great food, don't hesitate to make your way down.",

If you like to eat a beautifully flavored sandwich with a extremely refreshing Sonoran White Ale, then this is the place for you.   The atmosphere is like a quiet house. Though the outside is refreshing, going inside the house feels like you've been invited to your decently wealthy uncle's house for a bite to eat.   I got the BLT this time and the bacon is thick cut, smokey and crunchy with a slight chew. In other words, perfection.",

We ordered the Sheridan with a salad, the Jive Turkey with chips and the Coney dog with chips to go. We also had the TMI Lemonade cocktail which was delicious. Our food arrived promptly and we were silent with the exception of commenting on how good everything tasted. We took home half of our meals because we wanted to have desert. The salted caramel ice cream and the Triple chocolate brownie were amazing. We already knew we would definitely be back as there were other items on the menu that we want to try. This is absolutely a great place to dine and I am sure fun to hang out at the bar!",

But its one of those places that after trying it the first time, you never have the same excitement to eat there and when debating where to have dinner on a given night in the area, Main Ingredient always comes up as your third choice in case the your first two preferences are either closed or packed.    Meal:  We both had sandwiches and a side of the mac and cheese.  I can't remember what local beers we had, but they were excellent.  They have a terrific beer selection.  Taste:  There were many, many delicious choices on the menu and sadly, the food is not as appealing as billed on the menu.  Its still good, but it doesn't live up to the hype.  7 out of 10.  Value: I thought the prices and potions were very and reasonable, but the real value is in their happy hour specials. 4 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  Our server was very attentive, silly and friendly.  Her recommendation for craft beer was dead on.  9 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  I hate to repeat what others have said, but the atmosphere is a perfect place to chill out at.  I recommend this a top place for \"Friday Afternoon Drinking Club\".  5 out of 5.  Overall:  If you are in the area, you should give it a shot.  I think the next time I visit, it will be just for a few drinks and an appetizer.  25 out of 30 points, 4 out of 5 stars.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here last night for dinner.  The inside was packed so we took a seat on the patio.  It took about 15 minutes to be acknowledged by the waitress who said there was some confusion over who was taking our section and that she was very sorry.  Whatever, blah blah blah.  Their beer list as well as the prices on the beer are pretty good.  We each ordered one.  I was given a different beer than I ordered but I didn't say anything.    Originally I had hoped to make this a leisurely evening and not be rushed.  You know - have a few drinks, eat some food and just relax.  Instead, our beers, appetizer and entrees came out basically all at once.  I HATE that.  For an appetizer we ordered the veggie quesadilla.  It was HUGE and perfect to share among a few people.  The ingredients were fresh as was the guacamole.  My only complaint was that it was a little difficult to eat while not making a complete mess because it was so big.  For a main course my wife ordered some salad and I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak.  Her salad looked good and said she would definitely order it again.  My sandwich was very good.  It was meaty, cheesy and delicious.  The baguette was an interesting touch and was very good.  I had a Coke Light in a bottle which was a great compliment to my meal.    We also ordered the mac n' cheese as a side because for some reason when mac is on the menu I have to order it.  It was just ok.  Definitely different.  I can't really explain it though.  It was like a casserole.  The service was just ok.  I don't understand why places like this can't hire a few more servers.  It shouldn't take forever to get a drink or to get another one.  I don't want to feel rushed to order everything at once for fear I may never see my server again.   One of the best things about this place are the prices.  They are very reasonable.  On average the meals are like 8 bucks and 4 for the beers.  In a city full of fru fru overpriced plates and beers, this place stands out a bit.  On the other hand, in a city full of restaurants converted from houses, this place blends in.  They all have the same crowded interior, schlocky patio, a few cans of cheap beer, and food offerings that are trying to push the envelope and be all artsy fartsy.  I am not hipster enough to understand all this nor do I want to be.  Drinking a Schlitz on a smoky patio doesn't interest me.   Anyway, I'm glad I went and gave it a shot but this place really doesn't do it for me.",

    "text": "TMI is one of those cute, little places in downtown converted from an old house, inconspicuously perched along the street - I almost missed it! It's a few blocks over from the art museum and was our choice to decompress after an afternoon there.   I was so jealous of everyone sitting in their awesome outdoor space, but it was mostly all taken and I wasn't dressed to sit outside as the sun went down anyway, but now I know! Inside, the tables were all open. We took a high top in the back and slowly watched the place fill up.   I wasn't impressed with our server. My first impression was that she was young, which is okay, but she was young and pretty disaffected, had no interest in being there, helping us or unfortunately checking on us, clearing the table or bringing the check in a timely manner. The food runners were at least friendlier, so I think she was just a fluke and hopefully just having an off day.  I didn't care too much for the two beers I tried - an Oak Creek hef and a Red Nectar amber (and obviously the server didn't help out much with the selection when asked) - but they have plenty of other options, although not as many on tap as I would have guessed. I tried my friend's White Chocolate and it was different but good.  The food was great. It definitely made up for so-so beer and a less than so-so server. We split Artichoke Heaven dip - nice, big chunks of artichoke with melted cheese and chiles, which they seem to use to add a little heat to a handful of their dishes - and the Veg sandwich with a salad. The dressing on the mixed greens was light and delicious and the veggie sandwich was perfect. The menu says it's roasted seasonal vegetables - mine had shitaki mushrooms, summer squash, red peppers - and the garlic goat cheese was an amazing spread.   Thumbs up, definitely check out the patio!",

It was obviously someone's house once, and they left all the walls up instead of knocking any down and making a bigger room, which I think gives it a pretty cool feel. We drank a few beers on the outside patio and it was a perfect evening temperature-wise. The beer selection is ok. Like I said, lots of local beers, but being from NY I have an allegiance to east coast breweries- but always willing to try anything.

Really glad we did because sitting outside really made this dining experience because the patio is really nice and inviting, as was the inside, but since it was such a nice day it was cool to sit on the shaded patio.  We started off our lunch with a couple of draft beers that were only $2.50... such a deal!  I tried the white chocolate beer, which was surprisingly really good!  The Hubs and I decided to share the mac and cheese and the BLT for lunch.  The mac and cheese was pretty darn good... but maybe had too much green chilis.  The BLT was by far the star of the afternoon meal.  It was awesome... from the bacon to the bread and avocado, everything was done right.  Just really enjoyable.  I found the service to be good, but our waitress didn't seem too happy.  She was quick and helpful, so I guess that is good enough for me.

    "text": "03/12/10  Four stars for the food and atmosphere, but I deducted a star for the service.  I was to meet a couple of friends for happy hour here, but I arrived almost two hours before they did.  (He was waiting to get off work and had to swing by to pick up his wife, and I was getting hungry!  They knew this, so it wasn't an issue.)    (As you can see, it's been two months since our visit, so I forgot the name of the awesome server that was first assigned to me... silly me, I know, but I can say that it was a name of Hispanic origin.  HOWEVER, I do remember quite well the name of the server that took over our party, (a fave gemstone of mine), since my original server was assigned to work the patio.  We all considered leaving, but my friends had heard a few Yelpers and me talk TMI up a few days before at the Yelp In Bloom event and wanted to check out the ales and food.)  OK, onto the food!!  I came to check out the happy hour app menu, which I sadly found does not exist.  While there are beverages discounted during happy hour, the list isn't very long.  I understand that there's only one or two wines by the glass on it, as well as one or two draft ales.  I think he tried the Oak Creek Nut Brown (thumbs down) and two glasses of the White Rascal (thumbs up!).  (Another testimony to the subpar service showed us by that-who-goes-by-a-jewel's-moniker is that he was overcharged by not one, but TWO beer selections.  It's always a good idea to check your receipts!).  So what did I eat??  I had the terrific RB & C, made w/ roast beef, muenster cheese, and horseradish sauce on a baguette.  If you haven't already done so, you must RUN at this very moment to TMI and order one!!  Everything about this sandwich, as well as the side salad that accompanied it, was faultless!  From the deliciously aromatic, crusty baguette; melty muenster; ample portion of roast beef- cooked to juicy perfection!; and the divine horseradish sauce, I was in \"thunderbolt city\" with every saporous bite!  It was a battle of willpower vs. a basal desire for full sensory gratification.  Willpower won, my Mom able to enjoy the other half-sandwich later that night, but only because I was going to order the Artichoke Heaven, a dip which consisted of atichoke hearts and a blend of three cheeses, to share with my friends (they had it w/ LT chips, and I had mine w/ crostini and house-fried potato chips).  This dish went over well!!  Definitely a must-order-again selection.  Friends' selections were the Griddled Cheese and house-made salsa and LT chips.  Both sandwich and salsa were very tasty!  FYI: my friend had a hard time trying to order a Tequila Sunrise.  First, our server wasn't familiar with the cocktail.  Second, we were told by our server that the barkeep did not know what it was either.  After a few minutes, and by then, I started asking if I could get a Sidecar (no), a bartender finally came up and said that they lacked the grenadine to make a TS.  (No on the Sidecar, bec. they didn't carry lemon juice.)  Thought I should mention this.  p.s.  I just remembered... when I first arrived and sat in the main dining area of TMI, I was only one of maybe three people sitting there.  I found the music to be disconcertingly loud.  I can't recall if I put in a request for the level to be lowered...  By the time my friends arrived, it was busier out in the patio and in the main dining room; we'd moved to the community table next to the bar area, and we were practically shouting at each other as we tried to carry on a conversation.  Not ideal.  At least, not for me.  FYI, I heard from Matt D., the owner, that eight draft beers, two wines by the glass, and all cocktails are discounted during happy hour.  I'll have to go back soon and see if they'll make a revised Sidecar for me using lime juice!",

    "text": "I will start this review off by saying that I would normally have given this place 4 stars, but for a large dog-friendly patio, and immediate water bowls the minute your dogs butt hits the ground, they get the extra star.   We went today, a Sunday, and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have (a female harlequin Great Dane) and knew that it was fate.  We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.    They have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA). I knew I'd love mine, he LOVED his.  We had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others I've had.  So order it if your a Mac person, but don't if you're not.    We had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.  Lastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying.  Overall the food would have gotten a four, but the experience with cool people around us, and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal.  Now being added into the rotation.  Thank you Main Ingredient! : )",

Ever since The Roosevelt closed its doors, dwntwn phx has been in desperate need of an intimate, worthwhile spot to go to. Too bad I didn't discover this place sooner.   My wife and I are underground hip hop junkies so its only fitting we attend this place whenever we need our fix of MF Doom w/ Mac n Cheese.

    "text": "This is the kind of place that breathes the Central Phoenix vibe. The atmosphere is wonderful (and perfect for a date). It's small, low-lit and extremely cozy. When I say cozy, I mean cozy; I had dinner on a love seat. The music is at just the right level to hear people talk and totally suited the restaurant. When I was there there were jazzy renditions of classic hip hop tracks playing...just perfect.  Now, in this great atmosphere that they've created at TMI is a plethora of wonderful food and drinks. The beer selection is stellar, not choosing to go with more traditional beers on tap and leaning towards craft brews. That's a huge plus in my book. I love being drawn to a place because I know they have a unique beer on tap. After sipping on some great beer came some great food. I tried the cheese spread, the mac and cheese and the Coronado Coney. All three were bursting with great flavors that I can honestly say were unique to this experience. Lots of places serve similar items, but TMI puts a little twist on each dish that makes it their own. By the way, the waitress was extremely helpful and gave great recommendations.  Needless to say, I will be back here sometime soon to discover and enjoy more of what TMI has to offer. I hope this review might help those who are on the fence about trying this place. It truly made my night when I got around to trying it.",

I found the flavor of the Mac and cheese to be good, but too greasy. The peanut butter and jelly was good; it was like the comfort food of your childhood grew up to be just a bit more complex. But my favorite was the roast beef. If I was ever compelled to return this would be the item I would get. The heat on the horseradish was PERFECT.  Given the choice I would go next door to Humble Pie instead.",

I went here last week with some friends for drinks and while the prices are about the same as you'd find anyplace else ($4-6 pints), the real draw to Main Ingredient is how cool and hip you feel hanging out here. I also like how they have Four Peaks Hefe on draft, as well as other interesting pours like the Avery White Rascal. Never heard of it before but I tried it and it was delicious!   I'm definitely planning on going back to try the food. The mac n' cheese looks amazing (and not just because we share a moniker) as well as the jalapeno cream cheese with crostini appetizer.",

    "text": "I went for dinner with a group of friends and was super excited for this place. I missed Lisa G's and unfortunately, my expectations exceeded reality. The menu was good and some of the items were somewhat original, but it was the same theme among restaurants serving lunch food for dinner.  Central Phoenix seems to be notorious for this and I typically do not mind it most nights but tonight was different.   I split the mac and cheese and goat cheese salad with my friend that actually worked out perfect. The food was good, but somewhat bland. Thumbs up for the chili peppers in the mac and cheese to heighten the taste. The goat cheese salad with strawberry was flavorful but the dressing was a bit too sweet for my taste. My other other friends ordered the sandwiches that came with chips and were satisfied with their orders. They have a great beer draft menu and saw a couple of beers that I have not seen in other restaurants, which is a total plus!   So the food was good and had a great selection of beer, so why 3 stars? The SERVICE from before I even stepped foot into the restaurant! I called earlier that day to see if they were taking reservations since we had 6 people. She said she wasn't sure if they were and that she would call me back. I never received a call so I called back later that day for a followup. During dinner, there was a consensus that our service was not up to par, and we thought our server had some personal issues going on. After speaking with the waiter, who was very nice once he talked, made it known to us that they were understaffed and was having a busy night. I didn't think it was his fault for his lack of service but thought that management should of hired enough people, especially on a Friday night.   I am planning to revisit at a later time when they are more established and I have great hopes for a better experience.",

There are no heaters, which would be ok if it was a nice fall day or a summer night, but i was a bit cold towards the end.  There is indoor seating as well so this shouldn't be a deal breaker.  I ordered a few nice glasses of red, one pinot noir and one petite syrah.  I ordered the tuna salad and the bf ordered the grilled cheese.  It was just ok, and so was the service.  Our plates sat on the table for over 20 minutes after we were finished before they were cleared. Cute place, good music, not a huge variety on the menu, just salads and sandwiches.  I would likely go to humble pie next door next time while in the area which is how we spotted The Main Ingredient in the first place!",

Its 1940s style gentrified house into a great watering hole and more. Sorta reminds me of the lost leaf wood floors and outside patio n such. Many draft beers to choose from a perfect place to come to for a few drinks and a gourmet style soup , salad sandwich .. and even a all beef hot dog which may make you reconsider your life decision of not eating them. I saw a range of people there from fixed gear tattoo covered hip-sters to people my parents age drinking the Merlot and getting into the mini van after.  The music was some ones very eclectic down tempo electronic chill mix peppered with an assortment of emo ish / mild hip hop rap stuff..  I guess further reinforcing my hypothesis that there indeed may be, some thing for everything here.  We had a range of things from a house made salsa to a meat and cheese dish for appetizers. After 4 beers two hours a basketball game and some salsa I think it was round a 20 spot. Nice. They got a bar.. I guess.. Real limited to what you can order. Plasma TV for all you sports junkies. Certainly a good vibe'd spot to hang out. Certainly a stop next pub crawl I embark on that direction.",

    "text": "Wow. Just... wow.   My girlfriend and I made plans for a lunch date, deciding on downtown as our meeting place (she's in ultra-East Valley, I'm in uber-West Valley). My niece suggested this place, after I could only think of places which made my inner voice go 'meh'. Oh, I owe her.   Super-casual place, in a very small re-used house. Cool artwork (for sale) on the walls, great interior decoration, an overall nice ambiance. LOVED the musical selections. The volume seemed kind of loud at first, but I had no problem holding a conversation with my friend.   Quick, efficient, friendly and attentive service, even as the entire place filled up with a Saturday lunchtime crowd. I just wish I could remember the chap's name, to give him kudos. Hopefully, the 33% tip let him know our appreciation of his service.   I had the Great Divide 'Wild Raspberry' Ale from Denver. Yep, it's a girlie beer but wow, it was refreshing and berrylicious.   My friend Di and I decided to share the Artichoke Heaven with La Tolteca chips ($7) and Mindy's Mac and Cheese ($7). Both were served at the same time (perfect!).   The Artichoke Heaven was... heaven. Warm, buttery, cheesy, big chunks of tender artichoke scooped onto hearty tortilla chips. Yyyuuuummmm... super rich and indulgent. Well, I thought it was, until I tasted the mac and cheese...  My friend and I tried the mac and cheese at the same time. Several moments of silence followed, as one will do to show respect and admiration. The pasta was perfectly cooked (to me, this is the very important, as a limp noodle is notorious for spoiling a good time, tee hee), the cheese sauce was cheesy-good with a buttery richness and breadcrumby top crust. Oh yes, and the big chunks of fresh green chile baked into all of this. I swear, a chorus of angels somewhere broke into songs of praise. I have found my new comfort food!   What's really weird? We ate ourselves silly and still had enough for a third person. Well, a decent snack-sized portion of each lovely offering, anyway ;)   Highly recommend. I'll have to revisit the 4 stars for possible upgrade, after a second visit.",

And, gourmet food at very reasonable, regular prices really hit home for me -- my grilled cheese sandwich on fresh sourdough was a highlight.  If you're an olive fan, get the bowl of house-marinated olives for $3 -- they are intensely flavorful and are a great compliment to your wine.  The ambiance was also very cool -- in a 1920's house, dimly lit, and piping cool downtempo tunes gave the place a really chill vibe.  The outdoor patio will be great when it warms up a bit.  My only criticism is the bar.  Way too small for a place like this, with only about five seats.  If they truly want to entice the bar-goers at TMI, they will need to radically expand the bar.  Highly recommend for a casual drink, dinner or a get together with a large group of friends (the main space is very nice, and can accommodate larger parties).",

    "text": "The Main Ingredient Ale House And Cafe is a fantastic place to meet some friends and just hang. I have frequented this lovely 1920 bungalow style house, converted into a restaurant/bar, on several occasions. The food is fun and fresh. I would definitely recommend the TMI toast (warm, house-made jalapeno cream cheese served with crostini) and the Cochinita Pibil Tacos (slow roasted pork topped with cotija, pickled onions, & cilantro served on two La Tolteca corn tortillas with a side of black beans). The bar has a delicious selection of micro brews on tap. The staff is fast, fun and friendly. So why the two star rating? The heat!  I recently had dinner inside because, come on outside is unbearable and the idea of a heat stroke while you eat is not on my bucket list. As I walked though the door for dinner I was anticipating the cool kiss of an artic breeze to blanket me in happiness. I was sadly mistaken. Instead I was greeted at the door by the ambient temperature of a stagnant swampland. I was like OMG I just touched down in the Tallahassee Regional Airport. I immediately informed and inquired about the heat inside the restaurant to our waitress. Her response, \"Yeah, it's a 100 year old house.\" I should've immediately just ran back to my air conditioned car, but I was stunned by the response and too busy looking for Charles, Caroline Carrie, Mary and Laura Ingalls. OK, air conditioning was invented in 1902. So...... ok then, options: turn down the AC thermostat, purchase a higher efficiency air conditioner that will provide comfort to the customers or close for the summer similar to ski resorts. I felt the air conditioning kick on before our waitress returned for our drink order so I decided to stay and gut it out. The food was delicious and the several glasses of water couldn't come quick enough. So buy your The Main Ingredient Ale House And Cafe seasonal pass and come back in late October thru May.",

The beers however are the stars in my book. Good selection of craft beer bottles with a handful on draft. The best priced happy hour craft beers that I have found. $2.50 for any draft. They will usually rotate one or two of the handles based on the season, and switch up the styles every now and then. If you miss the happy hour times, don't fret...the bottle selection is wonderful as well.   The sandwiches provide a nice complimentary roll (HA!). A nice selection of different meats and combinations, as well as temperatures. They stay local with a Schreiner's coney dog, they get creative with their Cashew Butter and Jelly with banana sandwich, and my favorite is the Acapulco Cheesesteak.  Ultimately a locally owned place with great beer, fresh and local food, and fair prices in a cool atmosphere.",

    "text": "A recommendation brought us here. The place is an old bungalow style home with seating on the porch/patio. We opted to sit outside since I'm here to escape the cold in new England. Inside is a little small and may be warm/loud since it is basically an old home. The place gives off a hipster vibe with eclectic finishes and style. Great music with a low key atmosphere- perfect for a casual first date. As for the food, it was delicious. There were about 6 sandwiches I was dying to try but went with the Sheridan. Amazing. The north beach was a close second. One friend got the Acapulco which was also delicious (he was cool enough to give me a bite) and the other got the tuna. She is a little picky and wasn't stoked about the olives in the tuna but I thought it looked good. Overall, this place is putting out great food and backs it with great energy- definitely give it try.",

    "text": "Jason B. and I tried this place for Dinner last night. Having read the reviews on Yelp we were prepared for the lunch food for dinner. I think a sandwich for dinner is great every now and again!  We started with the TMI Dip, which was warm cream cheese with chunks of Jalapenos and lost of tasty crispy bread. This was good; I think the dip needed a little something else to make it perfect, but a good start to our meal.  Then we shared the Mac and Cheese, and OMG was this Mac and Cheese the best I have EVER had. There was tons of good quality creamy cheese, and green chilies. WOW don't change a thing!  I order for my main meal The Sheridan, which was spicy and very good. The salami and turkey made for a really well put together sandwich. I also had the side salad, which was dressed with the BEST balsamic vinaigrette! So good, I wanted more salad...So next time I will for sure order a salad with the vinaigrette.  I definitely recommend The Main Ingredient, even for the non drinkers out there, the food is really well put together!",

Let me tell you what I liked about it: -Food was good quality and yummy. -Beer and wine selection was above par and had some great choices. -They introduced me a great new Imperial IPA called Oskar Blues 'Gordon.' -The artichoke cheese dip was AWESOME (I highly recommend you try this.) -Environment this place is cute and fun.  We sat at the communal table (about 12 feet long) and enjoyed our first trip.  Areas for improvement: -The menu was SMALL (only a handful of choices in each category - appetizers, sandwiches, salads.) -The side salad was....um...lettuce and nothing more.  Overall...I will be going back...soon.",

    "text": "There's nothing better than a tasty cold beer and some good tunes on a warm lazy afternoon, and TMI is an awesome place to kick back and enjoy just that.  The beer selection, albeit somewhat small, is handpicked and lists some of the top beers around AZ.  One of my personal faves is the Imperial Stout - not only does it taste great, but I'm pretty sure its over 8% and definitely packs a punch.    The one-page menu has a tasty selection of appetizers, salads, and sandwiches, as well as some incredible desserts!  One of the first dishes I tried was the green chile mac n cheese, and what a great first impression.  I'm kind of a mac n cheese junkie... TMI's is creamy and yummy and the green-chiles give it just a bit of kick.  I've had several of the other menu items as well.  The artichoke dip is sooooooo good.  Even my housemate, who typically turns his nose at such appetizers, loves this one!  And the chips are from La Tolteca - perfectly crunchy and a little salty.  The salsa is being made in-house now and is so much better than before - great change, guys!  My absolute menu favorite is the recently added CASH MONEY sandwich, which is a house-made cashew butter, cabernet red pepper jelly, and sliced banana sandwich, toasted ever so slightly and served with chips (which are great when stacked on the sandwich, too - love that crunch!).  My second favorite entree is the Coney Dog.  Sorry to all my veggie friends, but this is so good I just can't help it!  This dog is topped with finely chopped red onions and house-made brown-ale-mustard, served on a small baguette.  I haven't had a thing at TMI that isn't delicious yet!  And if you like desserts, you MUST try the chile-chocolate cheesecake.  It might sound a little weird, but believe me, its just the right amount of chile to give an incredible flavor to what is already a delicately delicious cheesecake.  I've also tried a couple of the ice cream flavors and they totally deliver.  I haven't tried the Imperial Stout float, yet, but I'm pretty positive that's going to knock my socks off when I do.  I've always experienced excellent service at TMI.  Matt and Courtney always greet me with smiles, as do the rest of the staff.  One of my pet peeves is a sweaty drink dripping all over the table, so whenever I sit at the tables I ask for a coaster for my beer -- the servers (O'Leary rocks!) are always pleasantly accomodating.  I've never been ill treated or ignored, and not once has my server just disappeared when I'm ready to ask for the check.  As for overall decor, TMI is in a historic house in the Coronado neighborhood and is casual enough for jeans and sneakers, but for those folks who wave the fashionista flag, not to be discouraged -- TMI is swanky enough to support your trendy ass, too!  Inside are two small rooms with what appears to be the original wood floor and a candlelit fireplace.  The furniture (a couple high tops, couple low two-tops, and a long 16-person farmhouse table) are all cozy and comfortable while still giving an upscale impression.  The bar itself appears to be one big solid piece of wood, and its my understanding was custom made by the guy who owns the Royal coffee shop at the Phx Public Market.  But nothing sets a restaurant apart, in my eyes, like an awesome patio.  TMI has a huge patio that wraps around the house, and there are plenty of tables and shade to enjoy Matt's custom playlists (mostly laid-back hip hop). The music isn't so loud as to ever be overbearing, but loud enough that you'll eventually notice your head has been nodding in time to the music as you munch out.  Hands down I absolutely love this place, and its pretty awesome that I can walk the three blocks over to hang out. :)  ---------------------------------------------  I am editing this review to add the following helpful suggestions: - In summer months, a coaster would really keep my table tidy because the cold drinks sweat so much. - Printed menus on nice paper are a great touch, but they should be swapped out with fresh, clean versions when they get smudged with food.",

They didn't seem to do much -- pop in a refined bar, some new furniture and a slick paint job -- but the place is warmer and much more welcoming. I actually want to hang out at the bar and have a beer (or three).  The food is pretty ace (especially for opening night). Mindy's mac 'n cheese was so bitchin' and creamy, I should've just ordered it twice.  I imagine I'll be hanging around this place quite a bit. It's relaxed, the prices are very reasonable, and the new crew seems in touch with their clientele.",

    "text": "We stopped in here after a brisk walk from the light rail and were immediately greeted, even before stepping in. Inside, it was busy. Virtually every table was sat and the bar was full. Maybe it had to do with the building itself, but there was nothing about TMI that made it seem new or recently-opened to me. The vibe felt like it could have been here for years.  Although we were only out for drinks, the food looked really tempting. I remember seeing the Coronado Coney on the menu and rethinking having dinner #2. I skipped it, but I'll be back, don't you worry.   I had some draft Nimbus and noticed that their entire draft selection was either local or Westcoast, which later was explained to us as no accident. Some Dogfish Head, Stone, or some imports would be delicious additions, but it's not like you can't go anywhere else and get it.  After finally making our way to the bar, we chatted with the owners and tried a previously mentioned luscious dessert/drink made with an imperial porter and raspberry vodka. The owner was playing some oldschool Outkast from his laptop behind the bar, and I sampled an IPA out of Colorado (?) that I definitely want next time.   I'll be back soon.",

I love that they kept the structure of the house because it gives off a comfortable feeling. I wonder what the ambiance is like at night!  The service was great! We arrived at about 12:45 pm and were able to be seated right away (conveniently though because it was crowded). The servers were very attentive and kind.   The food came out fast. We ordered the TMI Toast for an appetizer, which was excellent but I wish it would have had a bit more jalapenos in it. I ordered the Baby Bleu salad and it was grand! The candied pecans were a wonderful compliment to the gorgonzola cheese. The dressing was nothing I have ever tasted before. It had almost an herb/flower taste to it. Needless to say, I ate the entire salad and it was definitely worth every bite. My boyfriend ordered The Sheridan and oh my it was beyond excellent! I couldn't help myself from stealing several bites. The turkey was so thick and succulent. It was a hearty sandwich, which is good because my boyfriend can eat a lot! Trust us... The Sheridan is a home-run if you are looking for a good flavorful sandwich!  Small downfall (not at the fault of the restaurant): the parking. There is a small lot in front but is almost always packed. Street parking is your next option, which can be a pain sometimes but it's worth it for this place!  All in all, a great restaurant. We will definitely be back when the weather cools down so we can enjoy some beers on the patio!",

The interior reminds me a bit of the ol' Lisa G's, but with more use of the space and, of course, 8 delicious beers on tap for 5 bucks a pop, including (but not limited to) Ska True Blonde & 4 Peaks Hop Knot & 8th Street Ale. They also offer some bottles as well as wines. But it's an ale house, so of course I'm coming here for some ales! I heard they have happy hour from 11am-6pm.   They have a small menu consisting of apps, sandwiches, salads, and desserts, with nothing over $10. We started with the artichoke dip (DELICIOUS!) and I tried my hand at the grilled cheese. It was good & filling. I definitely will try something different next time for a bit more variety.   Thy sure got their stuff together for being open only a couple of days. I will be back.

We ordered a bowl of hose marinated olives to start for $3 and were afraid we were going to get, like, 4 olives. Nope! It was a nice portion size! and they were delicious too. A little spicy with lemon zest... Then we ordered the roast beef with horseradish, the RB&C I think it was. Fantastic bread, not tooooo horseradish-y, and really tender tasty roast beef. Usually I stay away from roast beef because of all the weird stringy parts to the beef that you can't bite through so you end up pulling all the meat out from between the bread. Am I the ONLY one that happens to?... Anyway. We also ordered the Red Goat salad, and the goat cheese was amazing! It was really creamy and not goat-y at all! Sometimes goat cheese makes me gag because it tastes like barn. You know? Ok, now I'm starting to sound like a whiner. I'm not. Then we also ordered the Cash Money hot sandwich, which is Cashew butter, mildly spicy and sweet pepper jelly and banana. Sounds weird but it was Great!  I might go back again on Monday :)",

Their bacon was so tasty and crisp, the avocado and lettuce were green and fresh, and I'd marry the sourdough bread if I could. I'll definitely be back to try some other items.",

I am not sure what cheese they use, but it works. My hubby & I almost went to battle over who would get the last of it.  Veggie quesadilla was pretty good. I would like more variety of veggies added to it.  Mac & cheese was different. I'm used to the creamy type and this ain't it. It's more like a macaroni loaf.   Music was phenomenal. Digiable Planets, Al Green and De La Soul. We'll return for the artichoke dip and the music for sure.",

It is a wonderful combination of sopressata, provolone, artichokes & roasted red peppers on focaccia, served with a fresh salad of assorted greens.  Set-up in a converted house (which just adds to the ambiance) means that there is limited seating indoors, so get there early! There is a small patio with tables out front if the weather allows.  The place shares a parking lot with several other restaurants, which means that parking can sometimes be a challenge.",

I'm not a big sandwich person, but the ones here are pretty good.  I love the toasted bread, although it was a little dense. I also found the salad to be boring and overdressed.

We perused the appetizer menu and finally landed on chips and salsa. Now let me tell you about the chips. The chips were clearly made in the kitchen however, the salsa had great flavor but was half jalapenos that created too much of a spice!!!  For the entree, I went with the Cuban sandwich without pickles (eww pickles). It was not the best Cuban sandwich I have ever had but they did a very good job on it. It had all equal flavors contributing. I would give it a 7/10 due to the overload of mayonnaise and mustard.   My girlfriend went with the specialty shrimp tacos for her entree. She is deathly allergic to dairy so the waitress made sure there would be no form of dairy in her meal. Cheers to that! She absolutely loved the tacos. I even was spared a bite and the flavors of the chipotle mayo, cabbage and shrimp all combined to make a mouth watering bite.   Overall, this is a great restaurant. Highly recommend.",

I really like when restaurants have that type of layout. Happy hour was really great too. Their draft beers are normally $6, but on happy hour they are only $3. They have some legit drafts too so this is probably one of the best happy hour beer prices for good quality beer.   The food is where it went a little downhill for me. I got the green chili stew and I think I was just expecting something different. It had flavor and a good amount of green chilis, but I was hoping for more of a green chili sauce to be the base and it was more of a chunky stew. Maybe it was just me but I guess I was just expecting more of a soup consistency. It was  served with two corn tortillas on the side. My wife ordered a sandwich with turkey and salami and she liked it. I thought that the roasted turkey had a weird flavor but the salad dressing was really flavorful. I would return and maybe just try different things on the menu. Great happy hour beer prices and a great atmosphere though.",

I'm pretty sure that is the best Mac and cheese I've ever had in my life. It had a nice blend of cheeses, included tomatoes which added a nice flavor and was topped with pesto. A MUST try if you come by here. Service was great and quick. The location alone was even nice, having a very home-like feel with cool artwork throughout.

My daughter had the veggie quesadilla and said it was so good.  They were not stingy with the Oaxaca so it was good and melty. The peppers and onions added great flavor and the guac on the side was fresh and well flavored. We ordered the chips and salsa for an app. The salsa was tasty,  but very spicy.  I love spice, but for those who don't, just be aware.  The chips were the only downfall. Very thick and way too hard to bite into. A friend had us pick up a red goat salad to go for him and he said it was also delicious.  Service was quick and efficient.  Interior was inviting and interesting.  Menu online needs to be updated,  though,  fyi. Highly recommend overall!",

    "text": "The Main Ingredient is the kind of place you hope for but almost never stumble upon.   Mellow, heady hip hop bumps through the chillest little restaurant in Phoenix, with a staff that seems to be in-the-know on that family vibe that chain restaurants constantly pay lip service to.   While you'd normally think that outdoor seating is madness in a desert town like Phoenix, they've got an easy breezy (beautiful) patio set up that has just enough shade to make it really pleasant for locals.  (I hurried indoors before the filth of my Irish blood caused me to liquify like Senator Kelly from the first X-Men movie.)   The interior feels like the first floor of a BnB that's taken on the character of a genuine American pub, and the first thing I saw was a high-top of 4 eating robust, healthy looking food that looked RIGHT. Salads spilled over with obvious quality; sandwich breads boasted high caliber crusts, nuts & seeds; and demure protein portions paraded an impressive mixup of glaze and char. The kitchen knows what's up. Period.   Mr. McTummy rumbled as I stumbled into a low lounge chair and chopped it up with the host/busser over what qualifies as good rap and real food, then I poured over a menu that looked like it would be more at home in Santa Monica, but for half the price.   I ordered a roasted beat salad from my incredibly likable server, and she didn't skip a beat when I asked her to throw most of the fixings for a Cobb on top of that; she even gave me props like she really grokked the concept, and I felt validated in a quiet, groovy sort of way.   I'm only half way through my meal, but I'm calling it: This is my new favorite spot in Phoenix. They keep it fresh, fresh, fresh, FRESH.   Pass it up at your own peril.   I'm gonna go back to my nibbles and chair dancing.   Spooky out.",

The old, historic house offers a comfy, inviting spot to relax and enjoy an awesome meal.  Sara, our waitress, provided exceptional service, and the bonus was her knowledge of their beer menu.  They have about 10 beers on draft, mainly local, all delicious.  I believe their taps rotate, but if they have it don't skip out on the Sleep Dog Red Rover.  Delicious with lunch, and hard to beat at $2.50/pint before 6pm.  We started with their asparagus soup - amazing.  Next up sandwiches.  For me, the roast beef (hold the cheese) with their house-made mustard.  Main ingredient in the mustard?  Oak Creek Amber, also my favorite beer.  My friend grabbed the \"Cash Money,\" which we were uncertain about.  I can't imagine anything better - cashew butter (that I assume was home made), bananas, and a delicious cabernet-red pepper jelly, all served warm on toasted bread.  A-Mazing!  The patio was great for a nice Phoenix day, and the location can't be beat.  If you haven't been to TMI yet, hurry, you'll be sad you waited.",

    "text": "Well, I've been coming here for a couple of years now... not  very often, sometimes three times a month or more, sometimes I'll skip a month or so before I return.  We met up with some old friends from California the other day, and I thought I would order the macaroni and cheese for my three year old because the sandwiches are all made on artisan bread and a little bit on the tough side for a child.  When the macaroni and cheese arrived, it definitely looked homemade as I can see the oily, curdled cheese mess in front of my three year old.  I told him to eat, and he immediately started crying and saying \"I don't like it! I don't like it!\"  He is NOT a picky eater.  So, I let him \"skip\" this meal because I thought maybe he was distracted by our friends' little daughter.  We boxed up the food to go, and I was going to give it to him later on...but I took a bite of it myself and it was yucky.  I tried to fix it at home...still yucky.  I don't know if I caught it on a \"bad\" day, as we all have bad days, or if it's like that all of the time.  Mac and cheese with Rigatoni noodles???  Oily, crappy slop.  I understand the desire to use real cheese, but every good cook knows that you must use a flour/milk mixture so your cheese doesn't separate like that.  My review for this particular day is crappy, because I realized that this place is not kid friendly.  And, even the young crowd that comes here will eventually grow up and have kids of their own...and does the main ingredient want to lose their regular clients because there is no desire to create a kid menu?  Simple...get boxed mac n cheese, hot dogs, peanut butter and jelly, chicken noodle soup or even a can of spaghettios!  PARENTS WILL PAY AN INFLATED COST TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN ENTERTAINED WHILE THEY ENJOY A NICE LUNCH WITH A GLASS OF BEER, OR GLASS OF WINE AND SOME OLD FRIENDS!",

After living in SoCal, The Pacific NW, Chicago, and Europe, one of the main drawbacks of AZ is the lack of hip, delicious, unpretentious eateries. Thank goodness for TMI. It's chic but not snobby. On some days it reminds me of a German pub as you've got people from all ages congregating, it's fabulous! The decor is sleek, warm, and soft. There is a large patio and seating is available for both large and small groups...even intimate tucked away corners if you want a romantic dinner. I love the food, The Calvano with Turkey is the best sandwich I have ever had...ever. Hands down. Chic, fun, delish.  Life is good at TMI.",

The menu is simple but thoughtful and seems to rely on local ingredients.  I had the Calvano sandwich and my bride had the Seasonal salad.  We shared the Artichoke appetizer.  The Calvano was delicious and I'm slightly embarassed at how quickly I ate it.  Equally scrumptious were the appetizer and salad with the portion size being perfect.   One of the coolest parts of the place was the beer and wine list.  I know my fair share about booze but there were some options I had never heard of, much less tried before.  We ordered three different beers and were pleasantly surprised at the quality and variety. We will absolutely be coming back, oh and did I mention this was only on their third day open?",

    "text": "I just copied this from my blog. Photos can be found there: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.makespoons.wordpress.com&s=09e7b9bc035dbe4ca6116390d606e84719714e8d17bbd2c6e77283d896265da2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">makespoons.wordpress.com</a>   Taking up the old Coronado house that formerly housed the Lisa G Winebar, The Main Ingredient Ale House and Cafe offers high quality salads, sandwiches, and other assorted snack goodies at an incredibly reasonable (see: one of the best deals in town) prices.  According to New Times food critic Michelle Laudig's previous post on Chow Bella, new owner Michael Diamond wanted to open up a neighborhood wine bar and ale house that would cater to the craft/microbrew crowds of today's foodie culture. Did he succeed?  Boyfriend and I were eager to find out, as the aforementioned post boasted over a handful of draught beers and carefully selected wines from all over the world. Diamond previously worked with Phoenix Winebar power-house Postino, so that alone made me feel all giddy inside. After all, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it?  After driving over rivers and streams that flooded downtown, we were welcomed into a dark and intimate space that felt almost nothing like its former ghost. I was impressed with the atmosphere and general vibe of the house even before taking my seat at the high bar table and was anxious to see what the menu had in store.  First off, the drink list. While Diamond explained trying to shift the bar towards the craft brew crowd, I was a little disappointed in the eight beers on tap. Now don't get me wrong here, Four Peaks is a top notch brewing company, but doesn't every hipster bar and restaurant boast their very own Four Peaks brew? (See: Delux, the Roosevelt, Stax, and so on.)  While the beers on tap were nothing offensive, I was just a little surprised that there were more Four Peaks brews than anything else. It seemed like too safe of a list.  They did however carry the Sonoran Desert Ale, as well as the IRA by craft beer heavy-hitters Stone. (Personally, I think they should have gone with the IPA). The wine list? GREAT. Upon looking at the wine list, I felt as though I had just run around an open meadow in the Swiss Alps. Finally, another non-Postino run wine bar that didn't have the usual Russian Jack Pinot Noir or Sterling whatever mediocre red is popular this year-all at shockingly affordable prices, only two or three glasses at $10 and all else under that.  Food-wise, Main Ingredient hit the spot for me on such a cold and rainy Phoenix night. I opted for their Griddled Cheese; a grilled cheese sandwich made with muenster, cheddar, Havarti, and local tomatoes on sourdough. Ryan was a little more adventurous and tried their Jive Turkey which was oven-roasted turkey, jalapeno cream cheese, organic field greens, and local tomatoes on a freshly-baked baguette. Both were under $9, and came with your choice of a field greens salad or kettle chips.  Other fare: Mac n' Cheese ($7) and an assortment of desserts including cheesecakes by the Arizona Cheesecake Company. Highly recommended.",

We decided to share the mac & cheese, not a fan of this AT ALL. Maybe it's just my personal preference...I thought it was not creamy enough, the bottom was burnt to a crisp, there was way too much green chili in it, and the very very thick layer of cheddar on top was not tasting good at all. We could only take a few bites and had to stop.   We shared some vanilla ice cream & it was perfect. The service was great all around. We did have quite a few different folks helping us, but they were all wonderful, and this didn't bother me at all. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the day while looking at all the cute doggies that were coming in. They are VERY dog friendly here, and I love that!  I will return and would like to come in the evening and maybe try one of their sandwiches, they looked really good as they were passing by.",

    "text": "If you like hip hop and beer, this is your paradise.  TMI is my go-to spot. Great ambiance. Indoor and outdoor seating. The salads and sandwiches are good. Always has some good beer on tap with that sweet happy hour price of $2.50, as well as a large selection of bottled beer. And for the dozens of times I've been there, the service has always been good.  In case you didn't catch it, the place is named after a Pete Rock album (as evidenced by his portrait by the bar).  This place endlessly bumps chilled out, underground hip hop from the 90s and 00s -- Tribe, De La, Blackalicious, People Under the Stairs, Doom, Madlib, Black Sheep, Hieroglyphics, Roots, Souls of Mischief, Binary Star, Blackstar, and on and on.  For me, its a beautiful thing. I love this place.   That said, I have a few suggestions (with all due respect).  The appetizers leave a bit to be desired. Since most people are coming just for beers, it would be nice to see this section expanded with more munchies at a variety of price points.  Also, the porch on hot summer afternoons is unbearable.  I recommend putting up a vined terrace on the west fence to block the afternoon sun and make 7th St disappear.  Or maybe add some more umbrellas or vines on lines over the top of the whole seating area. Anything would help really. I would also add a couple long tables back by the old drive-through window to accommodate large parties. Usually, if you try to get there with your office mates after 5 on a Friday, there is no where to sit.    Overall: great spot, great service, great beer, great music, good food. Hit it up.",

A couple friends and I stopped in for a cocktail after lunch to check out the place and were pretty pleasantly surprised. The happy hour drink specials were impressive, $2.50 for all draft beer and $4 house wines. There wasn't an extensive draft list but they did have old Rasputin for $2.50 which is a downright steal. The house cabernet was better than we expected. I took the rating down a  bit because our waitress was not pleasant, she was walking around looking pissed off and put out to be helping us. With a little attitude adjustment this place would be better. I definitely plan to come back and try some of the food at another date.",

We met up at 1 and grabbed a table outside.  It was an absolutely gorgeous day and G was raving about the mac-and-cheese.  We both ordered that and it was really yummy.  Prepared like a casserole, it was full of onion and green chili, with a nice crust.  I'm pretty sure it's the best  I've had!  We were also there during HH and had some delicious beverages; my selection was the East Coast (?) and it was good enough that I had 2.  So TMI, here are some suggestions for getting the coveted 5th star:  try a different side accompaniment.for the mac-and-cheese.  The toast is weirdly out of place; perhaps a couple of oven-dried tomatoes would be good beside that dish and the toast can be crumbled on the top.  Additionally, the drinks I had were pricey, even at 1/2 off.  You're in a competitive neighborhood and shaving some of that cost off will get repeat business . So thanks for a great meal and keep rockin' the mac!",

Places seem to close so early around here! It's crazy! We pulled into one place and Yelped a couple other places before finding The Main Ingredient.   It's a little shady looking on the outside, to be honest. It's totally dark except for some candles you can see through the window, so we couldn't even tell if it was open. However, once we walked in, we were greeted by very friendly wait staff and were told we could pick any seat.   The menu is great-- basically everything is $10 or cheaper. There's a wide variety of sandwiches, as well as some specialties like tacos and quesadillas. We tried the veggie quesadilla with onions and peppers, which came with generous portions of salsa, guacamole and sour cream on the side. We also got the cheesesteak, which was was definitely not a traditional one, but had a great mix of flavors. We also tried a pork taco, which was super flavorful and delicious. It was more food than the two of us could handle, but worth it.   They play a great mix of music-- nothing I recognized, but some fun rap. Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating. If I lived in Phoenix, I'd definitely come back.",

The space has some creative art installations and the outdoor patio is cozy.

    "text": "Alright so I stumbled across this place on Yelp (because duh) the other day and decided to come in before the baseball game. The menu and reviews all looked good and we were all craving a sandwich, so seemed like a great fit!  It was a tad warm but decided to sit on the patio since they have the misters going on so it wasn't too bad. Like I mentioned, they have a bunch of sandwiches on the menu so it seemed like a must. I was debating between the tuna sandwich and the Jive turkey, and after asking our server her thoughts, I went with the turkey sandwich but subbed in the roasted garlic goat cheese instead of the cream cheese. Honestly, when it comes to sandwiches, there needs to be a good meat to bread ratio and ugh it just wasn't happening here. The sourdough roll is pretty thick and I got like two thin slices of turkey, which just wasn't going to cut it. I asked for extra goat cheese thinking that might help the bread overload but ehh unfortunately was a no go.  My bf got the torta and that was actually really good (way better meat:bread ratio); very flavorful too. Bf's dad got the cheesesteak and he had the same issue as me. And then our friend got the chilaquiles which he said were pretty good.   Soooo hm, not quite sure. Maybe I'd come back and get the torta or another menu item. I'm not entirely swayed either way on this one but it never hurts to give it another go.",

We had lunch, and I was impressed with the variety of salads and sandwiches.  We started with the hummus plate - very yummy with veggies and chips.   They have a number of local brew offerings.   I tried the tomato soup. Normally, I prefer mine a little creamier, but this version was still flavorful and less fattening.     Two of my companions tried the tuna salad salad - and they were a little disappointed.  Nothing special for them so they felt it was a little overpriced.   I had the pear and blue cheese salad with bacon. Wow. So very delicious. I actually thought there was almost too much bacon.  Next time I will ask for it on the side and share.  All the salads come with grilled/toasted bread.   The fourth person tried the club sandwich, and was full with half.  It came with a nice side salad.   The service was fabulous and friendly.  Overall, a nice venue.",

Drinks were served promptly and food orders taken and they actually came out fast. I got the grilled cheese sandwich. It was simple, nothing over the top and the salad next to it was a-ok.

The food is some of the best I have had in the area. Parking is rough at lunch time and the inside is pretty small. It also gets pretty hot inside in peak summer considering it is an old house that was made into a eatery.  Even with all of that, it is so worth a visit. I go at least once a month no matter the weather.   If you aren't looking for it, you will pass it right by but you would just be doing yourself a disservice. There are a lot of theme style restaurants in this part of town and most care more about atmosphere than food quality. That isn't the case here, food takes priority with these guys. The tacos are killer here and the service is pretty good for such an oddly layed out business.",

    "text": "This review was really hard for me to write because I don't know if I really got the best experience here. So take this with a grain of salt, but I was with a rather large group, about 10.   Decor: From what I could see this Ale House has 2 different buildings to sit in, the main bar, and a second, more seating and dining location. Wood tables with linen cloth, which was nice to see. I find it tacky when silverware is rolled in a paper napkin. Limited TV's so not really a great place to watch a sports game.  Food: Sigh, alright, this is seriously more of a cafe than anything else. I thought it would be a little more exciting, and it really wasn't. They had salads, apps, and hot sandwiches. I ordered a club which wasn't too bad, but the mac and cheese we got was just not up to par with what I would've liked. I feel like it was just mushy, and not really all that great. Maybe the kitchen was busy or something, but I wasn't really impressed overall with everything.  Overall: Honestly, I probably won't come back. I left feeling like I wanted more out of this business, and I don't think they will be able to deliver. Which is fine, some will love this place, and I'm glad they do!",

For this local it was kind of chilly sitting outside .  Definitely dog friendly though. If they were busy the parking might be a problem but on Tuesday night it was fine.  Even being off 7th Street the noise wasn't too bad. Maybe during busy times it would be worse.  McKenzie, our waitress, was friendly and waited for us to chat a bit before ordering.  We ordered the artichoke dip which came out hot. It had a good taste but a few stringy parts however the chips are made locally and delicious.  They might want the person who refills the water to take off his bracelet because when he filled a glass the ends of the bracelet grazed our soup bowl, not appetizing to me.  The enchilada soup was too spicy for me so they gladly took it off the bill.  However hubby loved the spice!  The baby blue salad had large chunks of blue cheese and was a large portion. The dressing was tangy, just right for this salad.  Hubby ordered the sandwich with turkey and salami (can't remember the name)  but the bread was really crust, a little too crusty for me. But the taste was good.  Unfortunately they don't have decaf coffee and that's all hubby can drink so no coffee with dessert. But I had regular and it's pretty strong. The cheesecake was delicious and creamy and plenty to share.  Not sure if I'd return but I would like to try the olives!",

Dry bread, dry turkey. Not enough cream cheese to give it any flavor.  One sandwich is probably not enough data to draw any conclusions about their full food offering. If you invite me back, I'll gladly go and try something else!   I think the laid-back vibe here with the amazingly-pleasant servers is also a huge draw to the Main Ingredient.

There was a great selection of craft brews. Love the glassware, and just the FEEL of the place. If furry is your type, you will likely find your soulmate here. I swear it was like they'd just convened the nightly meeting of the local slackers union.  Service was friendly, attentive, and I loved the patio.... this is just a great place to hang out in the evening. What a perfect neighborhood pub.   AAR - The owners are aware that actual carbs only make beer carbs more delightful, right? That one can only injest so much booze before they'll need sustenance and head elsewhere? Met a friend for dinner here and only the 10 minutes we took parking kept us there instead of seeking dinner elsewhere. There just isn't a menu to speak of. To say its limited is like calling Imelda Marcos an occasional shopper. It'd be tough to put a dinner together here, but we picked up the artichoke dip and a antipasti dish. The artichoke dip was actually pretty good, but the bagged tortilla chips it was paired with were terrible. It was pretty good with the crostini that came with the antipasti dish, but since we'd been given 2 pieces of bread for an entire plate of antipasti, that seemed poor allocation of glutens.  The antipasti was also good, a mixture of housemade olives that were great, cheeses, meats and grilled veggies. Perhaps its memories of the awesomeness that was LIsa Gs, that colors my expectations of MI.   I spose I wish there was a fuller breadth of options to go with your kickass brew selection at Main Ingredient.  But I'd absolutely pop in for a pre dinner drink or chill here on a Sunday afternoon.",

    "text": "Gem in the midst of downtown Phoenix. Charming house turned restaurant. The staff was welcoming.  We ordered the pork chile stew as an appetizer to share. Rather than serve us one bowl the chef/server spilt up the portions (I love when they do this)! We even got out own tortillas. The stew was spicy and served hot. My husband ordered the north beach sandwich. The fresh mozzarella and pesto took over most the flavor but was well worth it. I ordered the veggie sandwich with field greens and did not leave hungry or disappointed. The veggies were roasted to perfection and were very accommodating to the season. The field greens were dressed with the most delicate and flavorful of dressings. We'll be back as practically everything on the menu sounds delicious.",

They don't have very much variety on their menu which was disappointing. Our waitress came to the table and she was not the friendliest. I ordered chips and salsa and the mac and cheese. My husband ordered some kind of sandwich and it came with salad as well. We waited and waited for the chips and salsa that never came. The guy who originally greeted us brought our food. A few minuted later the waitress came over and said, \"Oh, we don't have chips so that's why you did not get your chips\". She did not apologize and just walked away. That would have been nice to know before so maybe I could have ordered a different appetizer. Our waitress never checked on us again and did not ask how we liked the food. I did like the mac and cheese, but I don't think I would go out of my way to go here again. I also liked the salad that came with my husbands meal. I liked the decor, but thought the music was a bit loud.",

    "text": "I have heard a lot of great things about this spot that was previously a home and now is a restaurant located downtown Phoenix so after a long day at work I met up with a few friends to check out what the hype was all about. This is definitely a trendy place with a lot of character. It can be a great date spot or a great place to meet up for a drink and apps. I love that they have a good amount of tables both inside and outside of the restaurant. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the fresh air and twinkling lights hung amongst the trees. The inside of the restaurant has an intimate vibe to it with low lighting and gives off that warm and cozy feel. I took the advice of my friends and started with their recommendation to start with Artichoke Heaven and I  with continue to thank them for that! It was HEAVEN! I think that the green chiles that are added to this dip really take it to a whole new level. I love goat cheese so I tried their goat cheese salad called \"The Red Goat\" and was very pleased. They give you a good portion of goat cheese and the strawberries were fresh. Their salads are large and can easily be spit or shared with the table. They offer a wide variety of Hot Sandwiches to choose from. The sandwich I chose was The Sheridan and I was very happy with my choice. Dessert is always on my mind but unfortunately I had no room left for the Triple Chocolate Brownie or the Beer Float, which were both highly recommended by our server. Overall, the staff was friendly but the wait time to order our food and drinks was quite long and our waitress wasn't as attentive as I would've liked her to be.  The food was great and the atmosphere was perfect!",

Sandwiches and Salads only. I understand that they do these things well, but a little more variety on the menu would be enough to bump this up to 4 stars. I would reccomend this place for lunch or beers but not for dinner as there are no entree's on the menu. Also, this place is in an old house and reminds me of the Rose and Crown. It also has a nice patio.",

I chose the seasonal Great Divide Wild Raspberry Ale, with amber tones and real raspberry essence. As a bit of a dairy diva, the griddled cheese sammie seemed appealing - it was recommended by several staffers and lived up to it's foodie fame. Paired with the soup du jour (cheesy chicken enchilada), it was taste bud bliss.",

I'm a little unsettled venturing out to restaurants/bars by myself, but sitting at the bar and ordering during my solo visit was a great experience.  The bartender was very welcoming and made me feel less self-conscious that I was drinking and eating by myself among the 20, 30-somethings all around out for their happy hour festivities.  I think the biggest appeal for me was that this place reminds me of a lot of the places I loved when living in Austin.  It's a charming house converted to a restaurant/bar with a really nice outdoor patio area.  Both times, I had Sophie's Salad.  Delicious!  I also tried the Salty Hog, which is a great choice if you're looking for a refreshing mixed drink (and you're a bacon lover).  I will definitely go back if I'm out in Phoenix again!",

My concern was the glassware was being over sanitized and I could taste the residue on the glass. Of course, this was affecting the beer flavor and we simply can't have that. Well, this issue has been addressed. That's great because the Main has always been one of my favorite places to hang out at in the hood. The servers have always provided patrons with great service. The happy hours runs from 11am. to 11pm. on Mondays, and 11am. to 6pm. the rest of the week. The food is pretty good as well. My favorite sandwiches are the Charlie tuna $8.00, and the Jive turkey also $8.00. They have other food items as well, I just get stay with my comfort foods. I don't venture. The beer selection will change from time to time but they have a great selection. I like the Main Ale. TMI also has wines and spirits. For seating the main has an indoor area. But most people like to sit outside on the patio. I know I do.  If you go there, I hope you enjoy a great experience. Everyone I've brought with me to the Main has really enjoyed it. All have returned for visits and brought new friends and family on visits as well.  As always if you see me there  feel free to say hello. I like meeting new friends. Enjoy.",

    "text": "Excellent place to relax and have a beer if you are craving a sandwich, salad, or appetizer for a relatively low price. Each category they seem to excel in when I measure dining in.   Not many places are actually nice to sit in when you start to weigh in things the way I do. I don't want to wait in a line or sit outside waiting for my name to be called or reserve way ahead of time. I don't like it when places look like subway inside if I am on a date no matter how good the food. I haven't been to Pizzeria Bianco for example for one of the reasons mentioned. But the rare gems of places with good food and a date atmosphere that isn't so trendy that I will be wasting an hour sitting are where I want to go with my girl for dinner. This is close to home so I pop by when I get the chance whenever possible. This is the food/service I have had and how I would rate it.  Service: 5/5 I don't recall ever waiting for a check or a drink for too long and even when the occasional mix up happens they remedy it promptly  Pricing: I would really expect to pay more for food this good.  Ambiance: 5/5 I love dining out here, they softly play old school hip-hip and trip-hop is present but you wouldn't here it unless you are trying. The city of phoenix art work on one of the walls is terrible but the rest of the decor is nice.  Food: Winner Salad w/ balsamic(homemade): 5/5 It is the best salad I have had. I cant stand the lemon vinaigrette version of this salad though( I dont like lemon on much though). I stumbled onto the balsamic due to a side salad having it once now I special order it this way all the time as it is the best damned salad ever.  rb&c: 4/5 This is a solid sandwich that I order every now and then, in the end it is just a sandwich though.  vegetarian chilli- 1/5 stay away unless bland is your desire, it is quite terrible.  Cheese plate - 5/5 I usually don't go for appetizers in the modern cuisine era as most of it is sub par but this goes in the hall of fame of appetizers.   Artichoke dip- 4/5 pretty good stuff also  olives: 3/5 Lolas Tapas had some 5/5 ones but are now closed.:(  Drinks: I love little bottles of ginger-ale and the hefeweizen  Desert: Chili cheesecake: 5/5 I am not a fan of cheesecake this with the balsamic whatever is amazing stuff. Highly recommended.",

Even though the place is small, it was not totally packed when we were there and there is plenty of parking in their lot.  They have music playing late at nihgt, so it gives it more of a bar feel than a restaurant.  Yay for The Main Ingredient.",

Good vibes, hip decor, comfortable without being pretentious. How can I not return on a regular basis?",

Jacqui J and I took out doggies to the dog park.  They're bruthas, you see, and hadn't hung out in awhile.  We had MLK day off together and spend the afternoon together.  Trying to decide where to eat with the pooches, I thought of TMI because I had seen so many people recently check in on Yelp.   Their patio is pretty big and mostly shaded.  This wasn't a day to be too concerned about shade, since it wasn't hot out.  I read the reviews ahead of time and already knew what I wanted before I even got there.  I was happy to have to take home a doggie bag, too.   I got the olives, red goat salad and the mac and cheese.  I will eat anything that includes green chiles in it.  Anything.  A few varieties of olives were served wtih fresh herbs and a dash an oil & vinegar.  I love all olives and don't always buy them for home, so it was a real treat.  They came in a little bowl, but there were about 20 of them.  The red goat salad was perfect: tons of pistachios on it, big chunks of goat cheese and strawberries. And den...and den...the mac and cheese, generously stuffed with chopped green chiles, ooey-gooey melted cheese that was crusty on the edges, the way it's supposed to be. I'll be back with Dexter.  They gave him a treat.  Oh, and my meal was treat.  I'm burping up the leftovers as I type this.",

    "text": "I've never been to the former restaurant that was once housed in this quaint little building, so my first impressions may be a bit different from others.  I have always adored this house.  It's absolutely adorable and in such a good location.  I read over the weekend that the new restaurant here was opening, so we made a point to visit it sooner rather than later.  We chose to go right after work, so there were only a few other people in here.  I really like the setup with the bar in it's own little alcove and seating situated throughout the rest of the house.  We were greeted immediately after walking in and we sat in a table by the window.  While we perused the menus I couldn't help but tap my feet to the killer old school music they were rockin'.  I ended up deciding on the grilled cheese to eat.  The food was very good.  The sourdough bread was super toasty, literally grilled to perfection.  There was a ton of cheese in the sandwich, but I don't remember which kinds.  The important thing is that it was really tasty.  My only complaint is that the cheese wasn't ooey gooey.  it was melty, but I could still make out the shape of the cheese.  In my book of grilled cheese greatness, it needs to be a little messier.  The sandwich was also served with a side of chips or salad if you choose.  The chips were good and I ate them all up.  There was also a dill pickle, but I don't do dill pickles.  I definitely think that this is a killer new spot that will do very well.  I have no doubt that this ultra-hip but non-pretentious spot will quickly become a neighborhood favorite.",

This seat-yourself restaurant certainly did not disappoint on atmosphere and their comfort food was just what I was craving on a surprisingly chilly night. My BLT was full of flavor - any BLT that includes avocado is top notch in my book. I only had two small complaints about our experience: 1. It was so dark at our table that we had to share the candle to read the menu. Great for ambiance, not so great for ordering. 2. Bad service. I am willing to say it isn't always bad, but our waiter never came to our table on his own accord. He would walk by six or seven times before I would finally flag him down to order, get the bill, etc. All in all, it was a great night though.",

Very uninspired. 4) wait staff acts like they don't give a crap. About you being there. About them being there. Surreal.  Ok that was 4 reasons. They do have a great patio but that's it. I'm not willing to sit thru boring food, a lousy beer selection, an surly waiters to come here. Too many other good locally owned places in central Phoenix to waste your time and money here.",

    "text": "So i loved coming here and relaxing and enjoying a drink or two with my bf and service seemed decent. So i had a surprise bday about a mos ago and there were about 4 couples who came and sat at their largest table which fit 12-14 people. Well everyone was excited giving me hugs and my surprise of them being there for my birthday. One of the couples had brought in two cups of their own and within 10 min of being there a lady came up and was very blunt and rude and took them from our table. I watched her dump out the cups and almost throw them away but decided to give them back and rudely set them on the table and walked away without an explanation. We all sat in awe. So we waited awhile for our  food and a waitress comes up and tells us to be quiet. Wowww! There was a full room of people and a table of 5 African americans that were just as loud but they chose to come to our table instead (kind of racist we thought & appalled) and music was  blaring. If they make large tables for that many people expect it to be loud. So i went to complain to a manager and the lady behind the bar who was rude and took our cups ended up being the 'manager'. I proceeded to complain and say she was rude & the 'manager' smirks at me multiple times instead of apologizing & 2 women at the bar jump in and defend her by saying  shes not.  The two women ended up being employees that were drinking after shift which didnt help the situation. We left very unhappy!! Im soo appalled with this place!! We all will never be back which everyone who came were all first time visitors. Quite embarrassing for my bf who set the surprise up.  :(",

But I won't come back because of little Miss Frowny Face. Hint: If you don't make your guests feel welcome they won't come back. The place used to be jamming but it's now empty at lunch time, probably because the menu hasn't changed since 2010, the whole mac-n-cheese, PBJ latch key kid cuisine thing is over.

We were lucky enough to make it there during happy hour, which meant cheap drinks! Tried the Salty Hog - a simple but refreshing Smirnoff and grapefruit juice drink with garnished with tender belly bacon and a salted rim (drooling just thinking about this flavor combination).  Started with the Artichoke Heaven, which is accurately named.  It's not as creamy as traditional artichoke dip, which can be good or bad depending on your preference.  There was great flavor and lots of artichokes.  My boyfriend got the \"Cash Money\" sandwich, again accurately named since I'm positive it really does bring in boat loads of cash money to TMI. This sandwich is a unique twist on PB&J using house-made cashew butter, red pepper-cabernet jelly and bananas.  I had the Acapulco cheesesteak - juicy roast beef with griddled red pepper and onion. Only wished there was a little more beef to balance meat to bread ratio.",

Dales pale ale and stone sublimey black ipa would be my other choices. Food is awesome, had the new menu item tenderbelly bacon sandwich and will get again when available. The pro pasta appetizer had cheeses, meats, and mushrooms that were top notch. All the staff is friendly and attentive in their service which is a big plus. Happy hour all day sunday is so nice, and i wouldnt worry about some reviews of the neighborhood which i think is great and what attracted me in the first place. The music is also something that just makes this a more relaxing place to visit, I highly recommend this place for all the reasons stated.

Yes, I have to admit that I laughed heartily at the \"bowl of balls\" they had on their menu, but that wasn't enough for me to go back.  Now that it's The Main Ingredient, I went with low expectations. I had the Winner salad - with turkey and salami and was impressed. The service was a little slow, but I liked what they did with the inside. It's another refurbished house and filled with quaint tables inside. It's got a killer patio, although I'm sure for only a few more weeks before it's intolerable to sit outside. I went a few days ago and had the strawberry goat cheese salad. We originally chose to sat inside, but there was blaring hip-hop music. I LOVED it, but the two people I went with for work didn't enjoy it as much. I thought hip-hop at noon was charming, but we ended up sitting outside. The service wasn't stellar, but they seemed a bit overwhelmed that day. However, it's a great place to lunch if you've got a little bit extra time. You can also easily pick up from here for to-go goodness. I've heard the sandwiches are good for gluten-lovers.   I just love finding another place not too far from downtown that has awesome salads (because I get sick of going to Cibo every day). Check them out, and go a little early for the best service. And hey, if you like hip-hop - maybe you'll get lucky and sit inside on a day similar to the experience I just had. PS it also looks like it has a full bar - score!  I've seen them fit larger (10?) parties outside or inside if you just let them know ahead of time.",

We sat outside on the patio because it was a gorgeous night. There weren't very many other patrons so I don't know why it took our server forever to come over. We explained that we WEREN'T in a hurry and that we would probably have a few beers and ordered an appetizer and an entree. The beers took a while to come out and the appetizer came out shortly after. Now, the food was definitely not the problem. It certainly did not dissapoint even this time. But a few bites into the appetizer the sandwich comes out and we've barely gotten into the app let alone we've hardly had a chance to touch our drinks!! We both agreed we would have rather had them just hold the sandwich for us while we had some time to get through the beginning of our meal. Here's the cherry topping...with the sandwich we had a choice of greens or chips. I swear we practically said in stereo, CHIPS. We didn't get chips. As a matter of fact, we didn't even get our server back to say, 'We ordered chips.' So we ate the greens with balsamic dressing (did not dissapoint, even though it's not what we ordered), finished our sandwich and beers and decided we did not want to spend any more money at an establishment that was going to give us crappy service. Needless to say, I doubt we'll be back any time soon. Which sucks. Because the food is great. :-/",

I would have to agree with a previous reviewer that the mac and cheese is too oily and not creamy enough, although it is pretty close to southern and Caribbean style, so this might just be a matter of taste - it was pretty good though.  My wife and I both thought that the BLT was phenomenal.  It had incredibly delicious bacon, red onions, and avocado that all worked together perfectly.  I would come back just for this sandwich.  Sandwiches are inexpensive, about $7-9 and the mac and cheese was about $7.",

Inside, the semi-tacky painting of the Phoenix rising above the mantel is pretty slick. It reminded me of when I was a child, staring at the uber funky mural in terminal 2 while waiting for some family member's plane to arrive. But, I digress. Anyway, the service was great - very friendly and attentive. We loved the artichoke dip. The sandwiches were reasonably priced and pretty good, to boot. Oh, and they have Four Peaks on tap and AZ wine available. All in all, I really enjoyed the vibe of the place and will absolutely return. If you haven't tried it out, you should definitely stop by.",

I was not sure what to expect, since I don't always have the best of luck when I go to places that are newly opened.  This place went beyond my expectations, especially with the food.  We started with the antipasto plate, which was great.  We decided to stick around for dinner.  The sandwiches were amazing, especially the roast beef.  I would definitely go back.",

    "text": "It was good and almost not good enough to be called that, even. We had been wanting to eat here for a while and finally made it out from Surprise las night. The appetizers were probably the highlight of the night; we had the Pro Pasto, TMI bread; chips and salsa and the olives. The TMI bread was enough to share with out group of eight and the Pro Pasto I would say was enough for four people to try some of it. The TMI dip was pretty hot (temperature, not spice) which made it all the better and made up for the fact that it needed a little \"something else\". The chips and salsa were pretty good, the salsa was fresh and spicy.The Pro Pasto platter was nice, it had genoa salami; longaniza; gorgonzola, parmesan; roasted peppers, mushrooms and zucchini.  So far, so good. Then the main course was served and we found out that our expectations were not met, rather quickly. I ordered the tacos and they were loaded with pork but I wish they would have had a little less meat to give room for some sort of spicy slaw, a nice salsa or something to add some flavor to it as the pork itself was bland. My wife ordered the beet salad and it lacked acidity in the dressing and they forgot the grapefruit slices; I would have sent it back but she was hungry and didn't feel like arguing. All and all, not bad enough for a 2 stars but almost didn't make it to 3, either. The place has charm and potential, the ideas are good but the execution needs a more inventive approach.",

If you don't care about eating within an hour, then please ignore this review.  With that out of the way: the food was terrific but the service was terrible. My boyfriend and I went out for lunch during the workweek (he had off but I had to get back within an hour or so). I had wanted to go to The Main Ingredient forEVER, but whenever I drove by after work, it was always packed, so I was excited to go for lunch instead. Well... no longer am I so excited to go back.  The big 'con' for me was the service: no one greeted us when we walked in, when we were able to flag down a server, she told us we 'weren't in her section' so she wouldn't serve us. We got a busboy to bring us water and a menu, but he said he couldn't help us with anything on the menu because he wasn't a server. Okay... 15 minutes later, our server showed up, and we just ordered without asking any questions because we were starving and on a schedule.  Long story short: we never were checked on, we had to beg the female server to refill our waters because, again, we 'weren't in her section', and then we contemplated walking out because our server, 45 minutes later, still hadn't brought us our check.  Obviously, we didn't walk out because we're not monsters, and we left a tip because again, not monsters, but that experience left a terrible taste in our mouths.",

This restaurant is very bright and cheerful with lots of cool art on the walls and soothing  music playing in the background to make this experience relaxing  and very inviting.  The menu has a really good mixture of salads, sandwiches and specialty  foods.  Our waiter  JJ was very knowledgeable about the menu, and very helpful. Our food came hot and smelling delicious . my husband got the chili and I got the steak sub. My husband who is very critical about his chili said it was made to perfection. Okay my steak sandwich was not a Philly cheesesteak like you get in Philadelphia but it was still delicious. Would I go back to this restaurant you betcha. I did forget to mention that outside they have a perfect seating arrangement for sitting outside and enjoying  the Arizona weather. They are open Monday through Thursday till 11 p.m. . Friday and Saturday they are open till midnight. And on Sunday they close at 9.",

It came with pita chips (not tortilla chips as on the menu). For main, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak without red peppers and I was a little worried about the chipotle mayo (I can't handle most spicy foods) but it wasn't too bad with the cheese and steak. The sandwich had plenty of meat and while it looked small, was very filling. Didn't much care for the potato chips as they were a bit over salted but were a good pairing with the sandwich.  While the food was great, I was decidedly unimpressed with the service. The waitress was very nice but ignored us for the most part, even when we tried to get her attention. The restaurant it very small (set up in an old downtown house) but they had the servers handling both outside and inside patrons instead of dividing the space between them like most restaurants do. Definitely not a place to go if you're on a schedule!",

They only have about 10 craft beers on tap, but all of them were from different brewers and there was a wide range of styles.  I ordered an Odell Amber that was amazing and my hubby got a Ballast Point IPA.  We ordered the Cochinita tacos which comes with two tacos and a cup of beans, and the cheesesteak with salad.  The meat in the tacos was super juicy and had just the right touch of spice.  They didn't skimp on the amount of meat in the tacos either.  The cheesesteak was chock full o' peppers and meat and my hubby would not stop raving about it.  The entire menu looked drool-worthy so we are planning to go back for lunch to try something else.",

The spicy banana and cashew butter sandwich didn't work well, because there was almost no cashew butter (which was amazing...the little that I did taste, at least.)

    "text": "I am at the point where I'm making up reasons to go to The Main Ingredient, it's gotten that bad. I love it. Jumbo Coney Island Hot dogs, baked crusty green chili mac and cheese and more microbrews than I can even count all set to old school East Coast hip hop? Be still my heart!  I can't remember the last time I've been to a place with that killer of a vibe. Actually, I'm lying, I can totally remember. It was Hanny's in January of '09. Restaurants never cease to amaze me at how little attention they pay (it seems) to the music/background noise they pump out into their business as if it's a minor detail. I for one completely disagree as the music and vibe are the difference for me between a quick 45 min meal or a 3 hour one. And you can guess the difference between the tabs/tips on the latter one.  Anyhoo, the food is always consistently fresh and tasty. Nothing overtly fancy, mostly sanwiches and salads with a few just like mom made favorites like mac and cheese and grilled cheese thrown on for good measure. Everything is pretty much in the $6-$9 range as well which is awesome. Service matches the vibe, very unassuming and laid back but never lazy or unattentive. I remember being sad when Lisa G closed her doors but I couldn't be happier with the restaurant that took her place!",

The atmosphere is good and the music is usually good.  To people who haven't been, I sometimes say that it's like The Roosevelt, except much, much better.  Sorry, Roosevelt.  The tuna sandwich is amazing!  I generally avoid dairy and eggs, but I order this tuna anyway and I don't ask them to alter it (hard-boiled eggs in the salad, havarti on the sandwich) because it works, it is incredible, and I cease to care when I am there.  The only other menu items I can comment on are the hot dog - good but frankly a little upscale for me when it comes to hot dogs- and the chocolate brownie which is, of course, very good.  My biggest complaint is that the food selection is not the greatest for vegetarians and vegans.  The restaurant was converted from a cute old home in the Coronado district and has a nice patio.  They have a pretty good happy hour deal, but I can't remember what it is at this time.  This is a place I'm always interested in visiting.",

I came here a few weeks ago for dinner/drinks with the boy since he had heard from a co-worker that their menu was pretty delicious, and more specifically that their mac n cheese was to die for.. Well let me tell you what, I had it, and it's not that great. At least on this particular night, I was definitely not impressed. It was loaded with peppers that completely overpowered any other flavor that may have been there. The boy had one of their *awesome* grilled cheeses, which again, wasn't something i would rave about, mostly because it was so unmemorable and basic, plus I kinda hate it when a place serves mainly lunch options for dinner. I like sandwiches as much as the next guy, but not for dinner. However, they do have a decent drink menu, lots of beers, wine & even liquor, so whatever your alcoholic heart desires, you will find it here..  Our service was a mess, I think we had 3 different waiters asking us the same questions over and over, then forgetting and asking them again. I don't care if the place was packed, get it together dudes.  The interior was classy & cute, but also a zoo.. So packed that I couldn't even get to the bathroom, people running into our table as they walked by and at one point I watched our waiter stand for 3 whole minutes, plates in hand, waiting for people to get the hell out of the way so he could drop them on our table. Maybe I am just impatient.. Anyway I realize this place is new, so there's definitely hype, but over all, I was just really disappointed in what I had hoped would be a close match to its previous occupant.   I will give it another shot, but I'm in no rush.",

We always felt bad that we never got around to going while Lisa G was still open, so we committed to not letting the same happen with TMI.   We were seated immediately, and on a Friday night (First Friday at that) we were surprised and delighted to not have to sweat it out with a crowd of hungry Phoenicians.   The service was prompt and friendly right off the bat, and before we knew it we were toasting our wine glasses (great selection of wines for a small establishment BTW) and noshing on what has become one of my new favorite appetizers, the TMI Toast. Stop it with that creamy goodness. It's a cream cheese-based dip that's light and fluffy and packed with jalapenos. It's like crack on toast. I woke up thinking about it.  I anticipate spending many, many more nights here as we just moved into the neighborhood behind this little nugget of goodness on 7th. AND, it's a dog friendly patio. WIN! And if you love good wine, cheap, hit them up Monday nights for $4 glasses from 11 am to 11 pm. Double win! I can't recommend TMI highly enough. Go and see for yourself.",

The first time I tried Mindy's Mac and Cheese I knew I had to try everything on this menu.  Unfortunately I'm gluten and dairy sensitive, but this is one of those dishes that I willingly indulge in knowing full well what the consequences will be.  The sandwiches and salads are great, with a lot of locally grown ingredients.  The RB & C being one of my favorites.  Presentation is great, simple, nothing pretentious, and really meshes well with their ambiance.  Why four stars?  This place gets crowded!  It's hit or miss really, but when it's packed, it's packed.  In the summer the place is just too hot.  The building is a renovated house in a trendy, hip area, with tunes piped through to the outside patio to match the vibe.  Honestly if you don't mind a crowded space you'll love it.  For me, I would probably frequent more often if it weren't for the parking chaos.  Lucky residents in the neighborhood walk here to grab a cold one, or enjoy a nice crisp wine.  The beverage selection is by far one of the more unique in this city, with Red Robins and Chili's on every corner.  There are a lot of local brews and quite nicely selected wines that pair well with everything.  Overall, this place is one of my favorites with great meals, great beverages, good vibes and good company.  One final plus is that the owners are always around, and often walking through meticulously arranging settings, cleaning the bathroom, etc.  For neat-freaks like me, that says a lot!  One thing that would be great would be some more dairy and gluten-free options in the future for folks like me, who would love to pig out more without feeling so bad the next day!",

Grabbed lunch with my intern here mid afternoon on a Friday. It's an entirely remodeled home turned into a restaurant. Go inside and you can see where the lviing room with fireplace used to be and the kitchen area too. All redone to be intimate seating and a very quaint but stocked bar area. Even the bathroom looks old school like they just moved in and the prior residents were just there! It's pretty cool.  We sat on the patio which had a ton of great seating. Couches for hanging and drinking probably to a little 3 chair bar area and plenty of patio tables with a great umbrella in the middle. Also to the side is this super funky old tractor contraption that now is a glorious fountain resting on a mountain of giant rocks. It's very cool. So out of place but I dug it.  The wait service was fantastic. She wasn't pushy but attentive too. We orded the baby blue and the BLT. The baby blue had the sweetest chewiest walnuts ever and what looked like perfect amount of blue cheese too. Apple slices wer cut super thin and drizzled with a yummy dressing. I had the BLT which came with a chipolte mayo saice and avacado. Yeah, that's right. The bacon was cooked to be extra crunchy and served on the best locally grown lettuce and tomatos. They give you kettle chips and a pickle spear. Hands down, that damn pickle was stellar.  Can't wait to go back on a Sunday or Monday for an all day happy hour.",

I didn't see the Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar on the menu, but hopefully it will return, because it sounds delightful.  I ordered the Jive Turkey sandwich, which the menu says has \"house roasted turkey breast.\"  I was expecting deli meat turkey, so imagine my great surprise when my sandwich arrives stacked with real turkey!  Like, delicious Thanksgiving leftover style!  It was perfectly moist and the bread was just the right texture and fresh to boot.  I'd had a late lunch that day, so one half of the sandwich was enough for me to feel full.  The side salad was so simple (just greens and dressing,) but it was really refreshing and delicious.  I wish I knew what the dressing was so I could try to replicate it at home or find something similar in a store.       Heads up to prospective diners who like to check the menu ahead of time: the menu on their website isn't entirely up to date.  I noticed some different sandwiches on the menu at the restaurant, and the beers on tap rotate as well.    I liked the atmosphere a lot, although the music was a bit loud inside.  I was there around sunset, just as the servers were going around lighting candles on the tables and fireplace.  The building is an old house, and I've decided more bars/restaurants should be made out of houses.  They make for a much more unique and comfortable dining experience.  I will definitely be back for happy hour.  Seriously, $2.50 pints are hard to top, and the fact that the food is pretty bomb doesn't hurt either.  If I lived in the Coronado neighborhood, I think I'd be here all the time.",

It sounded disgusting to me, but we ended up ordering it out of pure curiosity...and we were not disappointed! Although we were stuffed, there wasn't a crumb of that cheesecake left when we were done.  Even though the food is delicious, you can't forget about the drinks! They have great beers on tap, although I am partial to the Main Ale. And you can't be $2.50 pints during happy hour which is 11-6 and all day on Monday.  I will definitely miss you TMI!",

    "text": "It was ok, but there are a lot of other places I would choose before coming back. The food is good for what it is/quality-wise, but really limited in your menu choices and half of it doesn't seem like a meal and is really pricey for what it is. The atmosphere is kinda cool; a house converted to restaurant. The service was ok, but one bad apple kinda spoiled it slamming glasses on our table, not saying anything whenever he came by to check on our water like he was mad about something, possibly us even though we just sat down and didn't do anything to piss him off. Also they didn't make sure we had enough silverware and napkins and we had to steal some off the other tables. It might sound trifling, but if you want to charge that much you better be able to deliver. Overall, not bad, but at the same time I've had better easily and would rather go to those places or somewhere else before going back.",

Food/drinks/atmosphere I never was a fan of a BLT as I felt they weren't filling enough after trying the BLT here I completely regret never ordering them before the thickness and taste of the bacon mixed with fresh lettuce tomato and avocado with mildly spicy mayo deelish! They also add a nice green salad with a homemade balsamic dressing which the waitress was kind enough to pack me and extra one for home :-) I have had only a few drinks there don't remember the name but I know it was a lemonade which I drink a bit and one had me feeling great so the price wasn't that bad (around 8$) the atmosphere is best described with a business man head bobbing to wu tang clan.  The bad  Parking sometimes can be a headache but nothing u couldn't handle. And a few times it felt like they didn't have the ac on and had door open and fans on it was a hot 90+ degrees outside please just close door and let the fat people like me drink and not sweat lol.  Great place great food great music and great staff.",

I had the Sheridan and my boyfriend had the Jive Turkey. Both sandwiches were filling and tasty. The beer was good and only 2 bucks. A bit pretentious though, my boyfriend asked for a fried egg on his sandwich, but they said they wouldn't do it because eggs would run out for dishes that needed eggs. If that's the case, go get a dozen from the local grocery and make your customer happy.... ijs. Quaint patio.",

I met a friend there on a Tuesday night and it was quite busy inside. They have happy hour with $5.00 wines which is nice. The food was quite good and the wait staff very attentive. However, this day it was 114 outside and i do not think their air conditioning was working very well. It was so hot inside it was uncomfortable. As the evening went on the music seemed to be getting louder. We were not able to hear each other speak. It was not like that when we first got there. They do have really nice outdoor seating as well. But, since it was  so hot we had to sit inside.  Too hot and far too loud but, other than that very nice!",

I've been here a few times, tried multiple items, and was hopeful each time...but my end reaction is always \"meh.\"   All their beer and wines are from the good ol' US of A - I think their wines are really over priced for what they are.  Happy hour only lasts until 6 and the only wines on happy hour are their house wines. Meh.  They do have a few vegetarian dishes - mac n' cheese, grilled cheese, a salad or two, and a roasted veggie sandwich. None of it really wows me with flavor and the veg sandwich tastes greasy. Meh.  I like the cozy atmosphere - the inside is dimly lit and the patio is a lovely area where you don't feel like you are sitting right on 7th street.",

Other than that, the glass did pour me 3 refills which was PLENTY so i didn't feel jipped......except by the lack of extra bubbles that comes from a fountain cola, but i digress.  I had this amazing salad. it had artichoke hearts, pine nuts, onions, mozarella, and leafy greens. top notch. everyone elses food looked amazing too. especially that damn hotdog. i wish they had a few more menu options unrelated to sandwiches or salads, but i definitely recommend. super good.",

It's quickly becoming a weekly hangout, especially since Monday boasts $2.50 drafts all night. The rotating tap currently is the Peach Ale from Four Peaks which is a personal favorite, so I've found myself walking on over to Main Ingredient more often.  Everything on the menu I have tried has been scrumptious including, but not limited to their award-winning and decked-out hot dog, Jive Turkey sandwich and Baby Bleu salad, which goes amazing with the Peach Ale, just sayin'. Also, the turkey used here is roasted in-house.  The other amazing thing about Main Ingredient is that they are pet-friendly. Bring your pups along and the friendly staff will put out a water bowl and make sure they're happy. My roommate's little Ruby Rue loves to lounge in the evening warmth as we throw back a couple beers, especially since she gets lots of love from friendly neighbors and staff.",

We went in around 7 on a Monday night. To my surprise the lot was full as was most of the adjoining street.   There were a few people smoking on the patio even though I believe it is forbidden.   Inside is a old hose turned in to modem bistro high top tables, dark walls a bar and loud pounding music. Every table had a nice romantic candle.  The menu mostly consists of salads and sandwiches. We started with the olives appetizer, just a mixed bowl of green and katamala olives $3, I love olives so it would be hard to screw up. For our mains we had a veggie sandwich $8 It was nice on well toasted bread grilled veggies and a great sauce, however the kettle chips were not that great and from a bag. The salad we had $8 was great and fresh with field greens, local tomatoes, artichoke hearts, fresh mozzarella, red onion,  pine nuts & fresh basil tossed in balsamic vinaigrette however the cheese was a bit skimpy.  Over all this may make a great date place on the patio, inside the noise level was a bit much but the food is good and the prices are right.",

    "text": "Been here a few times and really like it.  Chill vibe with a nice patio area.  Parking here can be difficult, small lot and the neighborhood nearby is usually pretty full too.  Beer selection here is usually good.  They don't have a lot of taps, but usually have a beer or two I haven't seen before which is rare.  Beer on tap is always reasonably priced too, don't think I have paid more than $5 and I know I have gotten beers I paid $7-$8 for at other places.  Food is really good.  The BLT I got here was the best I have ever had.  Amazing bacon and really fresh avacado.  I've come with a big group before and not one person had anything but rave reviews for what they ordered.  The Mac and Cheese and Griddled Cheese were both highly recommended by multiple people.",

    "text": "I saw a lot of other reviews comment on how busy this place is on weekdays. Well, apparently the time to go is Saturday a little after 11am! Plenty of parking, immediate service, and the whole place smelled like bacon. Yum.  We sat outside on the lovely shaded patio. For an appetizer, the tortilla chips and salsa are awesome--better than a lot of Mexican restaurants around. The salsa has a nice zip to it; I can't take really spicy stuff and I loved it, and my husband who craves nuclear-level spicy loved the salsa, too. My 9-year-old son, who is autistic and not one much for commentary, declared, \"These chips are really good.\"  I had The Winner Salad. Yum! Great size for a salad, not too big and not too small. The turkey pieces are actual thin cut turkey breast and the salami is awesome. Some places skimp on the cheese, but they served up lots of soft cubes of fresh mozzarella. The vinaigrette was lovely and fresh. If anything, the bread served on the side seemed very bland in contrast,  My husband had the macaroni and cheese. They serve it up like a big brick of cheesy awesomeness. My husband LOVED it. The green chilies gave it a fabulous kick. My husband also enjoyed the happy hour prices for pints of beer.  Really satisfying experience there, and a place we know we can visit again as a family!",

We both decided on sandwiches, the veggie for me, and the BLTA for my husband. I was planning on ordering an iced tea, but was then informed by our server that draft beers were $2.50. Since the beer was the same price as an iced tea, I decided to go for the beer which was Sonoran White Chocolate Ale (one of my faves).  Our sandwiches were served quickly. They both came on flavorful herbed focaccia. Mine had a delicious mix of grilled vegetables including: mushrooms, squash, and roasted red pepper with a flavorful goat cheese spread. My husband's was pork belly bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and a delicious chipotle sauce. Both sandwiches were extremely tasty and our lunch experience was very good. We will be sure to come back to try more of the menu.",

    "text": "So... Here's the deal.  I waited a long time to eat here.  A long time.  It always sounded great but the parking lot was always full - too full - and I'm a bit of a claustrophobe.  However, last fine Saturday night on our way to see the Cirque show we drove by and the parking lot had a few spots.   First impression:  Super cute!  Reminded me of The Roosevelt.  Beautiful patio (full) and candles and the whole \"old house\" feel inside.  We were told to seat ourselves.  At least 3 waitstaff passed us with no acknowledgment.  Our waiter came with menus and took our drink order at the same time.  Fine...  But, bummer, sodas come in cans (no refills) and I am prego so beer and wine are off the table (ha).     We were stoked to order and the chips and salsa were slow to come but super yummy.  We were excited to get our \"mains.\"  He had the mac n cheese which, he says, tasted good but he could tell it had been re-heated.  To me it tasted like the inside of a refrigerator and reheated.    My salad would have been AMAZING (great portion size, good flavor) but it was totally WARM.  Like, limp lettuce warm.  And it had waaaay too much dressing which only added to the limpness.    The waiter didn't seem to take the \"we are ready to go\" cue very well and by this time we were pushing it to be on time for our show.    So...  Ambience:  5 stars Staff:  2 stars Service:  3 stars  Food:  2? stars Chips and Salsa:  5 stars  We will likely be back again for a brew on the patio but other than that... Skip it.",

The Main Ingredient is what Arizona needs in terms of Downtown establishments that arent looking to impress anyone and theyre quite comfortable with their own identity.   In short summary; if you're not a TRUE hip hop fan and favor the god awful sounds of Fetty Wap, 2Chainz, etc, this isnt the place for you. Strictly Atmosphere, MF Doom, etc being played over the speakers.   Dont even look at the menu; in what may sound like a safe choice, The Mac & Cheese is to DIE for. Ive gone broke ordering three plates one time (TRUE STORY).   And to wash it all down, choose from any number of solid draft beer choices on tap. Theyre typically the first to have out of market and/or seasonal brews. Back before Pumpkin Porter became the popular behemoth that it is today, I could always count on Main Ingredient to have it on tap 1st.    ENJOY!!!",

We stepped inside this place, and as it was darling inside, it just turned into patio weather that day. And for me... That's the only option when you have a nice patio with patio seating still available. So we sat at a long kind of bar top outside to look out on the down town street corner. They have a place to give your dog a drink, a place to park your bike, and all kinds of down town goodies. They had a nice selection of craft beers. They were on Happy Hour. It seemed to me that they are always on happy hour. But I didn't find a happy hour menu. We were just please that when we got the bill they were much cheaper than what was posted on the drink menu. The food menu was filled with delicious, and different options. We decided to do one a little out of the ordinary, and one staple dish. The first meal was their Cash Money....house-made cashew butter, Red Pepper-Cabernet Jelly, & banana, on sourdough. It was a great spin on a traditional PB&J. Makes me want to experiment at home. I do think that next time I will ask for a little extra Red- Pepper-Cabernet Jelly though. The second dish we got  was The Acapulco Cheesesteak......juicy roast beef, Oaxacan cheese, griddled red pepper & red onion, cilantro, & house-made chipotle mayo, on baguette. This is THE BEST Cheesesteak I have EVER HAD. My husband agreed. And he is a Cheesesteak fanatic. That cheese, with those perfectly cooked red peppers, and that chipotle mayo... You CAN NOT go wrong. And after all that, the bill was not bad at all. We were pleasantly surprised. We cant wait to go back and try more.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for a while but when we first walked up and saw all the hipsters hanging out front and the club-ish hip hop and techno music playing loudly on the inside, I was not sure if it was really for us. The first impression was definitely that they thought they were too cool for school. But after we were seated it turns out our waitress was really warm and friendly (of course I forgot her name already). I love the fact that they have such a diverse bar with lots of good wine and beer on tap. I ordered a pint of the Odelay from Four Peaks which is a winter seasonal that I didn't even know they had. I thought it was interesting that my \"Untapped\" app had it listed as a Brown Ale even though TMI menu referred to it as a porter but after I tasted it, I agreed it was more of a porter so I guess the barkeep here knows what (s)he's doing.  What makes me a \"fan\" of this place really is the food. Maybe we just got lucky and ordered the right stuff but both hubby and I loved our meals. He got the Acapulco Philly which is basically a Philly cheesteak sandwich but with Mexican cheese and a bit of heat. He wanted soup on the side but not their soup of the day so he got a cup of the green chili to go with it (small upcharge). That chili was amazing! Usually I don't like chili verde when they use those New Mexican hatch chiles and spices. This was a different recipe altogether... I'm not sure what kind of chile was in it but most of the green came from tomatillos which I love. It was so good! If you like salsa verde you have to try this chili. For my meal I ordered the conchinita pibil tacos. The plate came with two taquitos but they were stuffed so full that it was really filling. Also a small cup of black beans which were pretty tasty too. The pork in the tacos was so tender and juicy with just the right amount of sauce. We were both laughing that this brew pub had better Mexican food then most of the so-called Mexican restaurants that we usually go to.  It is pretty rare that we find a place that we both loved our food. And there was plenty more on the menu that sounded good so I am sure we'll be back. I still don't get why the music was so loud because other than that it seemed like a nice, chill place with candles scattered around and cozy intimate tables and comfortable seating. Next time I'll enjoy my cold brew out on the patio maybe.",

It's not really clear what you're supposed to do...  Anyway, the food was great! I got the Sheridan sandwich- turkey, salami, cheddar.. the \"Prohibition Ale mustard\" on it was awesome. Mustard is mustard, but this stuff was real good. This sandwich in one word is a MESS. I mean, things were sliding all over the place. But it was so so good. My fellow diner got the North Beach- prosciutto, pesto, greens, mozzarella... it was great as well. Who doesn't love prosciutto? Side salad that comes with the sandwiches (you can get chips too) is big. I couldn't eat everything, but I'd definitely come back for more.",

It seemed to be cooked too long and it lacked the jalapeno flavor. The service was very slow and the over all vibe of the place seemed uninviting. The restaurant is converted from an old home which was pretty cool, it gave it a \"hipster\" feel. They didn't seem to have a host/hostess so the direction of whether to just it down or wait to be seated seemed unclear.",

You can have a drink at the bar then go eat outside with no problem. $5 pints, can't beat that. There food is reasonably priced as well and served in great portions. Not too filling but just enough. My favorite meal is the RB&C. It's a hot roast beef sandwich with havarti cheese ( I believe ) with a horseradish sauce on a nice crusty roll and toasted to perfection. I myself, always, ALWAYS, get extra horseradish sauce on the side to dunk my sandwich  and chips. The sandwich is by far one of my favorite foods in AZ. They even allow dogs on the patio which is great as I love to take my dog places with me.",

Key Limetini is amazing - so refreshing, so delicious, and strong. A couple of these will knock your socks off. TMI lemonade is also great. I could rotate between all three drinks all day, but common sense tells me this isn't the best idea I've ever had.  Chips and salsa are great and a bit spicy. TMI toast sounds great but I thought the cream cheese dip was bland and not worth the calories. Sophie's salad is delish. Veggie quesadila is also really good and comes with a nice side of salsa and guacamole. Griddled cheese is so great - my husband likes adding bacon to make it even more hearty and delicious. BLT is also good, and veggie sandwich is yummy. I am not a big fan of  the jive turkey sandwich - the meat is super dry, and there's too much of it. The sandwich kinds of falls apart and makes a big mess, and trying to piece it back together isn't really worth it.  Service and prices are good. Parking is pretty ample, although during happy hour it can be hard to grab a spot. Overall, still quite good!",

I love sitting outside in the patio and listening to old school hip hop. Great date place, group place and dog friendly.   They have a rotating taps, which usually has at least one awesome and rare IPA such as Green Flash West Coast or Coronado Islander.   The food is great too. I love their salads like the Baby Bleu and the Winner. The grilled cheese, Artichoke Heaven and Jive Turkey are all phenomenal too.

I've enjoyed their sandwiches and green chili pork stew that was almost too hot for my taste but like any self-respecting addict, I keep ordering it anyways.  I've been stuck on their Cobb salad which boasts more food than I really should eat but in the True spirit of American overindulgence, I clean my bowl every time.  Service is really good and I can be in and out quickly if need be. Parking can be tricky but lets be honest, it's 7th street and parking is at a premium.  Pet friendly patios are a nice touch but watch your dish if you plan on feeding the local cat a sliver of bacon.  Not that I did it, just saying...",

Peppers and onions were cooked perfectly, still had a little crunch. Sheriden (turkey sandwich) had lots of sliced, moist, flavorful turkey. The ingredients all worked well together. Bread was nice and crusty. Kettle chips were cold, taste like bagged kettle chips and I didn't care too much for it. I expected them to come out freshly cooked and hot which would've made it awesome. Side salad was a nice mix of greens but a little too much dressing for my liking.   Great deal on beers during happy hour. $2.50 pints! They also had 1/2 price starters but there wasn't one that truly caught my attention so we didn;t jump on that deal. Loved the music and the casual, chilled vibe of the place. Not a place I'd want to eat at all the time, but a place I'd come back for from time to time. Minus one star because they could offer better sides to accompany their tasty sandwiches.",

It has a very cozy vibe to it, and the patio had a good amount of people on it enjoying this wonderful weather. The service was good. Our waitress Elaina let us know which beers they were out of. And when they didn't have the one I wanted, she was quick to suggest an alternative which was just as good.   We ordered the Calvano, and the Jive Turkey. The Calvano was good, it was almost like eating a pizza (just as Elaina told me). It had sopressata, artichoke chunks, local tomatoes, red peppers and a good cheese to compliment, on chibatta bread. I didn't try the Jive Turkey since I'm not a fan of cream cheese (it was either that or cottage cheese, hell I don't remember) but she said it was a good sandwich. Both sandwiches were accompanied by a side salad that came with dressing on it (don't know if you have an option to choose something different) which I thought was a great choice.   The best part about this place for me was the music. I've never been to a place like this that plays hip hop! Adi don't mean that cookie cutter bullshit that's on the radio. I'm talking about Beastie Boys, Pete Rock and CL Smooth, DTMD, T-Love (bonus props for them playing this, I've never heard her music played anywhere but in my CD player)  some serious underground (read: REAL) hip hop. I had heard a couple of Pete and CL tracks while I was there, but it didn't occur to me that the restaurant was playing tracks off of Pete and CLs second CD entitled.....The Main Ingredient.  Well played guys, well played.   So for 3 beers, and 2 sandwiches, total came to 34.98. Not bad at all. I'll definitely be back, and I'm bringing friends with me.",

I have never ordered anything I didn't love (with the exception of the cheesecake, which isn't made in-house - it was just okay). I crave their tuna salad on a regular basis - it's good both in the tuna salad salad and in the tuna salad sandwich.  The grilled cheese is the bomb, and so is the cashew butter banana sandwich. The mac and cheese is superb, as well. Seriously, everything rocks. I highly recommend ordering the mixed greens as your side if you get a sandwich - the dressing is light and citrusy and smacks of homemade excellence.   Oh, and it won't empty your wallet, either.

One suggestion - dump the damn 4 Peaks beer.  Everyone has it, it's not that good, and there is better stuff out there.  Also - add a cider to your selection.",

The bread on my focaccia sandwich had no flavor and seemed almost \"cardboardy.\" The prosciutto was rubbery. There were people smoking on the patio within 5 feet from the door which was blowing right to our table. I inquired about this with the server (it's not legal in Arizona), but I was met with apathy and a shrug. Add more variety and quality to the menu and service and this spot will be great. Drink menu is one plus. Good options there!",

    "text": "Really Yelpers? Four stars? It isn't often that I disagree with a Yelp rating this strongly, but unfortunately I did not have a good experience during my recent visit to The Main Ingredient.   It's no lie that I have had this little restaurant tucked away in an old house bookmarked for quite some time now. I had read great reviews and kept meaning to stop by, but for some reason it always slipped my mind. On a recent Tuesday night I decided to drag my husband out of the house and finally try out this little restaurant off 7th Street. Upon our arrival, I noticed that parking was a little scarce, but no big deal, we parked down one of the side streets and walked along the sidewalk to the cute little house The Main Ingredient calls home. We were immediately impressed by the patio that's littered with tables and chairs in front of an old porch. Pretty adorable. We walked in the front door and a young guy immediately informed us that we could choose our own table...don't mind if I do! Being a Tuesday night and all, the place wasn't exactly crowded so we chose a cozy spot in the corner with a hightop table and a TV close by. There was a unique mix of hip-hop-ish music being played that was a refreshing change from most restaurant tunes. We both immediately liked the setup of the restaurant and were excited to try out the menu that had everyone raving.  Unfortunately, the positive experience pretty much ended there. A little while after seating ourselves, a well-dressed, funky server came to take our drink order. Her exact words upon greeting us: \"What would you like to drink?\". I thought that was kind of weird. No \"hello\" or \"how's it going\", just straight to the point without any friendliness. Luckily the guy who brought our waters and ran our food was a little more pleasant. Since this was our first time here, there were multiple menu items we wanted to try out. We started with the chips and salsa which were pretty tasty and by far the best part of our meal. I ordered a Peach Ale and my man went with a Coke. After enjoying our chips and salsa, we were served our main course (which came out pretty quickly so timing wasn't really an issue). Ever since LGO got rid of their green chile mac and cheese I have been seriously searching for a replacement. I was hoping this would be it, but I was horribly disappointed. I have to admit that the mac and cheese was part of my reason for choosing The Main Ingredient that night and it just didn't hit the spot. In fact, it wasn't really mac and cheese at all. The consistency was bready and weird and I sincerely missed the cheesy pasta that makes mac and cheese such an American classic. I get that they're trying to do something different with the dish, but for me it just didn't work. I ate a few bites and definitely didn't ask to take the rest home. No thanks. My husband's meal was slightly better, he ordered the veggie sandwich, but just wasn't anything to write home about. Overall, we were disappointed with the food. For comfort food, it wasn't very comforting...  So after trying out the food, I was convinced they were a three star restaurant. Not horrible, but definitely not a new favorite. But when you throw in the horrendous service we received, their rating has to lose an extra star. After our lack-luster greeting, the service only went downhill from there. My husband sat for 10+ minutes without anything to drink, our server never came to ask how we were enjoying our meal, and our plates sat stacked on our table for more than 15 minutes while we waited for our check. We even watched our server bring other tables their checks while we continued to wait for our own. She wasn't busy waiting on tables, so I guess she was in the back doing something else. Not cool.  So I'm sorry to say this, but I just don't think The Main Ingredient will be added to our list of favorite restaurants around town. With the bad service and the disappointing food, it just doesn't compare to so many other great spots. It's a shame too because the atmosphere and menu really had some great potential. :(",

The sandwiches are AWESOME.  The first time I came here, I immediately found excuses to come back; it is like a sick addiction that you can't escape, no matter how hard you try.

My roast beef sandwich was tasty (and the mustard was sublime), the service was slightly above so-so, and the crowd/atmosphere was totally in my wheelhouse, but when on the clock dining at an Ale House you can't help but leave feeling disappointed. Seems like my sandwich was crying out for a beer to keep it company.  If I had to complain about something it would be the $3 charge for a flat bottle of \"Coke Light.\" No, really, that's what the oversized bottle said. It wasn't Diet Coke it was Coke Light. The margin on soda always favors the house but $3 for a Coke is re-gosh-darn-diculous.  The location is ideal for post-work drinks so I'll definitely update this review after I've partaken in the Ale House's brews.",
