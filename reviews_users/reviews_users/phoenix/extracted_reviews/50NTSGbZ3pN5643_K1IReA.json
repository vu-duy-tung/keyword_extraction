    "text": "First let me say I have been a customer for 20 years so it is with a broken heart that I give 2 star review.   And the only reason I did is because my server and the hostess were so nice.   I was in a party off 5 and 2 of the meals were not fresh.   My mom ordered a chimichanga and it came to the table soft,  not hot and crispy.   She dealt with it.   My best friend ordered the carnitas.  The plate and food were cold - beans, rice, meat - everything.   We were seated outside where the service is always slow (we expected it,  that always happens).  My best friend went to the hostess table to address the issue quickly and waited for 10 minutes before the waiter or manager would address her concern.   Then the manager - Eddie - copped an attitude and said she should have told her waiter, why was she telling the manager - at this point she still hasn't seen our waiter.  When she tried to explain she would have told our waiter if she had seen him at any point during her wait.   The manager then demanded to know what she wanted,  a replacement meal,  a comped meal or what.   He was so pissy she was nervous about getting \"secret sauce\" of she had a replacement plate, not to mention all of us were done eating by this point.   Such a disappointment.",

She described it as a mom and pop hole in the wall with great food. She was so right. I had a combination plate with a tamale, cheese enchilada and a beef taco. The enchilada sauce was exquisite with an amazing texture. The red chili beef tamale had a nice kick to it and the cheese enchilada was a nice balance on the plate. Also try one of their specialty margaritas.",

    "text": "My first trip to Via was about a year ago for a friend's birthday. I was kind of surprised that she chose this little place 45 minutes away from her home in Tempe, but immediately understood as I walked into the front door.   It's kitschy-cute, loud, unpretentious, and STACKED with hundreds of different options of tequila. What's not to love?  The veggie-friendly menu is pretty awesome, too, and definitely a huge plus for a sit-down Mexican food restaurant. I've literally had cravings just for their rice alone. So good!  The house margaritas are something ridiculous like $2 or $3 a piece but are pretty syrupy sweet. I ask for half the syrup and a splash of ice water, and they're actually drinkable.   This may not be a place you want to go to for a romantic date or a 'light' lunch, but it will be the place that resonates in the back of your mind anytime someone suggests grabbing Mexican food. Listen to that voice.",

My wife had the #15 combo, 2 cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. I had #8, two shredded beef tacos, with rice and beans. Of course chips and salsa were served. The salsa was weak and was just a notch better than Pace. The taco sauce could have been from a jar also.  My tacos lacked any rich flavors, and not only were the shells stale, they were cracked beyond even being able to be held. Would have made a good taco salad. The rice and beans had an odd odor, which I think was old grease or lard. The beans were super bland and the rice was just nasty. If I am going to raise my cholesterol level, I usually expect top notch artery clogging fare. This isn't a place to obtain Crestor helping levels. Two other places are better if you ask me, hands down - Carolinas and Guadalajara.   I will leave this joint to the local area patrons looking to get their buzz on in a run down (basically a bar) joint slinging some premium tequila and cheap house Margs.  I don't think I will circa de Los santos instead of traveling via the saints!",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Via Delosantos, and not only because it's about a 5 minute walk from my house. Their house margaritas are only $3. Are they the best margaritas you'll ever have? Probably not. They're a little sweet and made with a mix. But will they get you drunk? You're damn right they will. And for the price, you really can't beat that. They make it easy for you if you want to turn any of their 50+ nicer tequilas into a margarita: just add $2 to the shot price.   As for the food, I've never been disappointed. Some things are better than others though. Their Pollo Fundido is truly the best in town. I've never had a better tamale, and they have red and green sauces. I believe the red is vegetarian friendly, so when I had my veggie friend visiting, she was happy to have an authentic tamale to try. My husband and I mixed it up last time we went and split the Super Mexican Pizza, which was surprisingly good. It was on a huge tortilla and had machaca beef, tomatoes, green onions and black olives. Ask for a side of sour cream and you'll be in heaven. One mexican pizza, a margartia, a Dos Equis and tip= $25. Not bad for a night out for two, and we even had a few pieces leftover. Personally, I didn't care for their guacamole. It just seemed like mashed up avocado to me, no especially interesting additions, so that's the one thing I'd steer clear of.   I don't personally know what \"real\" Mexican food is...I've never been to Mexico. All I know is my husband and I have been told by several people from Mexico that we're lucky to live by one of the best authentic places in Phoenix. So take that as you will.  The place is a little run down, but to me that's part of the charm. I love sitting in the little back room, it has a more personal feel. They get pretty busy around dinnertime on the weekends, but the wait never seems to be more than 10-15 minutes. Fair warning: They close at 9:30, even on Saturdays, which is pretty annoying. I thought the hours listed here couldn't possibly be right, but I called and confirmed.",

Ordered the Tacos, because that's what goes best with tequila & beer and they've done themselves proud to make a great tasting crispy taco!

I think they are now $2 but still definitely get you messed up and are tasty enough for only 2 bucks. It puts some people off that the margaritas are poured from a tap like a draft beer, but once you have two or three you are fine with it.  I witnessed such a lady make an issue with the draft margarita who insisted on having it shaken in a cocktail shaker. The bartender reassured the senorita that this was the house margarita that everyone was enjoying. She just couldn't wrap her head around it. I wanted to say \"Listen lady, Its $2... and it will get you fucked up, just enjoy it\"! But my reserved nature dictated otherwise. The atmosphere and the food are above average, standard Sonora Mexican fare that is not very spicy.  The location is ideal if your buddie's girlfriend is having a baby at John C. Lincoln hospital and you want to have the \"Holy Shit! your a Dad\" talk over 3 pitchers of margaritas. Because when you are done he can just walk back over to the maternity ward while you finish your green chile quesadilla.",

The chips and salsa were good but not great. The rice and beans were blah. The vegetarian chalupa had a lot of guacamole on it topped off with lettuce and cheese. I can't believe they even serve this on the menu it's horrible. My cheese enchilada topped of with their white queso sauce was really good so if I ever get dragged to this place again I will order that. During dinner my sister mentioned that she has seen roaches in the restaurant while she was eating and In my head I was thinking \" Dammit Arik B was right\"!",

Several dishes feature calabacitas (zucchini), corn, cabbage,etc. - including a calabacitas stroganoff type dish over a bed of egg noodles (instead of spanish rice), which was filling and tasty.  I'm not vegetarian - I just think it's different and interesting. The salsa is also unusually good.   Our service has been below average more than once and the atmosphere inside can be quite dark and dreary. Once, a guy in the front of the parking lot was trying to sell his shotgun in broad daylight.  I dont say that to imply any sense of danger as to convey the marginal Sunnyslope surroundings that might offend certain sensibilities.    I'm glad I tried Via Delosantos.  We still joke about the shotgun, and the menu's a kick. But I dont plan on returning anytime soon...not unless someone puts a gun to my head",

However, the service sometimes lacks and it doesn't always feel like the cleanest place, so 4 stars it is...  The salsa is great - flavorful with just the right amount of heat. I usually wind up eating way too much of it before my meal arrives. My two favorite items are the cheese enchilada and green chili corn tamale, enchilada style. At a lot of places, the red sauce is too tomato-y for my taste, but Via's is the most authentic I've found. I'm not really a fan of red beef tamales, but I tried a bite of the vegetarian green chili corn tamale when we ordered the appetizer sampler platter once while dining with some friends from out of town, and I was hooked. Now we order a dozen of them for Thanksgiving each year.  The Mexican pizza, pollo fundido, fajita burrito, and calabacitas are also very good. Disappointingly, one thing I would pass on is the guacamole - it's bland and creamy to the point of being a paste.   If you aren't familiar with this area, as other reviewers have noted, it's not necessarily in the best part of town. However, I worked in the area for years, and it's still worth the trip. There are parts of town I would definitely hesitate to venture into, but this isn't one of them.",

Here's how the nite went - sat down waited 15 minutes before we flagged down a busboy for chips and water. Chips came out hot and fresh with some tastey salsa! Thats when we should have left! We finish our chips and salsa - still no waitress, no menus and no waters!! And not just us mind you, the entire section!! Finally, a waitress gets to us and asks are you ready to order? Again, no water and no menus!! After another ten minutes makes her way back with water and menus and we order. Food comes out in five flat!! Precooked slop! Fish tacos stunk! No flavor - all fishy smell! Heres the kicker - shes drops a check on the table when we start eating and then gone again! She never comes back - no refills, no boxes for the kids meals, nothing! Again, this is the entire section!!! Well, I was going to skip out on the bill but, I paid and of course left her zero tip! NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, AGAIN!! My wife even apologized to me about going there - on her birthday no less!! AVOID! THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!",

If you go on the weekends prepare to wait 20-40 minutes, but it is indeed worth it.  The food is very good and the service is hit or miss but what impressed me most is the wide selection of Vegetarian dishes.  I am not vegetarian but some of my friends are and sometimes I just feel like eating something lighter.  They have a great selection of grilled veggie filled burritos.  You can also get sides of grilled veggies like asparagus, zucchini and carrots.  Be sure to try the grilled carrots.  The parking sucks,  the servers are sometimes not nice and the place sort of looks like something in a bad dream featuring Antonio Banderas and a mariachi band,  but the food will keep you coming back.",

    "text": "This used to be my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix.  About a year ago my husband and I both became violently ill a few hours after eating there, and after reviewing what we ate in common determined it had to be the salsa.  So we stayed away until Sat. night when we decided to give it a try again.  The place has always been scary by its appearance but we were amazed how much it had run down in just a year.  Everything was dirty, from the floors on up, including the inch of grime covering all the crap hanging on the walls, which keeps them from really cleaning or putting a badly needed fresh coat of paint on the place.  There are holes in the booths with stuffing spilling out and there was a big smear of dried salsa on the mirror hanging right next to my head.  All very unappealing!  Add to that stale, tough tortilla chips, a very bland green chili burro and watered-down Margarita and I'm writing off an old favorite.   Unless you really like the dangerous feeling you get when you walk into a border town dive, stay away!",

The bartender was amazing- so friendly and efficient; however, a while into our meal, an old woman aggressively asks us if we are planning on ordering any more food. We said no, and she said that we had to pay and leave because they needed the table for other people that would be ordering food. I was so appalled; not only were we spending good money on multiple drinks and food, but we were not being noisy or inappropriate. I have worked in restaurants as a waitress for years and I have never seen someone be so disrespectful. There was no explanation, no compromise, no apology, nothing. She was extremely abrasive and rude about it. It's unfortunate because I was hoping to come back again regularly, but after that experience, I will be going somewhere else.",

The huevos con chorizo-- awesome.  The beans and rice on the side-- perfect.  Chips and salsa were also way better than average.  Next time, I think I'll just have them bring me a trough of the obscenely good green chile stew!  I am too stuffed right now to contemplate it.

I hoped for the best and was a good sport.  We ordered a cheese crisp and shredded taco appetizers.  A basic House Margarita, frozen, was good.  The cheese crisp was super crispy and the perfect balance of bubbly hot cheese to tortilla ratio.  The tacos were the best I have ever had at this location.  Service was a little slow, but competent.  So, I can say that I was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED by this most recent visit.  More cautious optimism, less avoidance, for now.",

The corn tortillas that came with the dish were OK, but they stuck together in the wax paper roll they were served in.

    "text": "I don't give ratings this low very often but after looking forward to the evidently over-hyped Via Delosantos I was as thoroughly disappointed as can be. Our server was kind and attentive, and the crispy cheese app was actually quite good, but that's where the praise ends. And the demerits were enough for their rating to drop from what would have been a 3 (if the food just wasn't for me) down to a 1.  The beef fajitas were not plentiful but that's okay because they were overcooked and utterly tasteless. But that wasn't the worst of it. The shrimp enchiladas were disgusting. Usually (but not exclusively) shrimp or seafood enchiladas are covered with a cream sauce. These were covered in a tomato sauce that was closer to the taste of a tomato paste however. A poor chef's choice perhaps, but also poorly implemented. But even then it got worse.  The shrimp were either of an extremely low grade or not cleaned well, or both. Each bite seemed to introduce more and more grit making the dish completely inedible. We didn't complain and paid the full bill but left most of our meal on the table and left unsatisfied, disappointed, and with absolutely no desire to ever come back.  Via Delosantos came highly recommended and hyped even more. This was reaffirmed by the high ratings. Well maybe all that comes from the experience of an earlier time, but don't believe the hype. To even call this place ordinary is giving it far too much credit. There are SO many MUCH better places in the area that even \"average\" should have a tough time... much less \"well below average.\"",

Overcast January day in Phoenix and I'm cuing up the Mexican soup memory. The place is just as hole-in-the-wall as ever and congrats to them! ... Celebrating 30 years on July 4th of this year.   I've never had a margarita here but they look legit. You'll be intimated to get a Dos Equis though. If the XX pinata doesn't pressure you, that guy who doesn't always drink beer but when he does is here in life size cut-out form. And on a poster. The salsa (hot) is a \"must-taste\" even if you don't do hot. It's got great flavor, doesn't burn your mouth but will clear your sinus. The mild is straight-away good as well.   The two chicken enchiladas with rice n beans were tasty too, though more meat wouldn't hurt (I always feel this way, really!)   Have I mentioned the Albondigas soup yet?! It's so flavorful. Two big meatballs in the medium (size) and among other veggies, carrots! Is this the only Mexican dish that contains carrots? I mean besides like home-pickled carrots n jalapeno?   Good service, good food, even if more Americanized Mexican. It's fresh and well-flavored. Haven't mentioned this part yet: reminds me of this place in Cancun - high school trip - some Mexican stranger who quickly became our tour guide & amigo took us down a narrow road and into a stucco room brimming with color and cerveza. This place reminds me of that place. Maybe not worth a drive for some, but definitely delivered for me today. Albondigas!",

    "text": "Went w/ a total of 11 people, mostly adults but a few younger children, ordering a wide variety of items.   We were seated w/in ten minutes, which is pretty solid considering the size of our party.  First off, let me say the chips and salsa were excellent.  Absolutely delicious and fresh salsa, same with the chips.  I had the Mexican pizza, with half shredded beef and the other half chicken.  A+ on the shredded beef, and there was a boatload of it.  Very good chicken, although I think shredded Chx is preferable to the cut up chunks of chicken.   Still great all around, one of the better Mex pizzas I have had in years.   My wife had the Chx chimi, and she said it was even better than Macayo's, which is her, up to now, favorite.  Other people with us typically had burrito's or quesadillas.  All said the food was fresh and very good to excellent re: taste.   One person, who is accustomed to quite spicy food, said the carne asada burro was too spicy.   This surprised me, must have been quite a bit of kick to that carne asada although I cannot say for certain.   We had two pitchers of XX lager, which was cold and reasonably priced.  Slight downside to not having cold mugs, but no biggie.  Very reasonably priced in total for the size of party we had.  I will add this is a pretty small place, so that might result in lengthy waits on occasion, I can see the potential for that.  Place is a tad cramped, but that just adds to the atmosphere.  Service was prompt and courteous.  In total, I'd say 4.9 stars.   Even better than Valle Luna, my otherwise favorite.   Both my wife and I preferred Delosantos over our LT faves, which says a LOT re: our having lived in the Phx area for decades.  The only very slight gigs, to me anyway, were that shredded Chx would be preferable over the chunk, and it seems some of the items might truly be on the spicy side.  'course that's why one goes to one of the last family owned/operated Old School Mex restaurants.   Flat-out excellent, wish we lived closer.",

If you want classic Phoenix-Sonoran Mexican food and great service in Uptown, this is where to go. Service is quick and happy. Chips are thin and crisp; the salsas, regular and hot, are tasty. The menu is extensive and the food is delicious. I can't imagine something that you would want in a Mexican restaurant that isn't on their menu, including vegetarian options, egg dishes and their own unique pasta dishes. Walk into the dining room and look around. You'll see that this is the place that locals and especially Mexican-heritage families go. 'Nuff said (except note that this is for the dining room; the bar room experience can be different as in a different kind of local crowd that's not everyone's cup of te...quila.)",

Confused because we ordered food, we carried on. Michelle then demanded we move seats because this booth was his \"money maker\". We asked to speak to management. Patty then help us get through the hiccup. When leaving we wanted to pay through the manager on duty up front. The bar tender then followed us to make sure we were going to pay. At that point I was hoping Patty the manager would smooth things over but was disappointed how she proceeded. The bar tender called the police and Patty then told them we would not pay and to hurry. Will return to eat however would like to speak to the owner. Please help, I love this place. Owner, please call me  602-390-0253  Thanks, Garrett",

Neither one of us was a huge fan of the salsa or chips, ( we were hoping to get closer to the salsa my fiance's mother makes since one of the reviews says \"Not white people mexican food\" however according to my fiance the food we had was a mere okay, and didn't live up to that.  The service was a bit slow on drinks and we barely saw our waitress. It was terribly busy so that may have accounted for the service...although the food was out ridiculously quick!  It wasn't anything I got really hyped about, not being big drinkers I don't think we fit the primary people that this place appeals to (those who love tequila).  So if you're into drinking, this may be an amazing stop for you with its huge list of tequila, if not, you can probably find better food elsewhere with about the same prices. By the way, if you're going around dinner time...you're probably going to have a little trouble finding parking because they are packed!",

Margaritas were fantastic. Our entrees were pretty solid. I would have liked a bit more spice to mind but overall I was pleased. For the price it was  a good dinner.  Service was a little slow and spacey. I'd say it's a decent stop to make.",

    "text": "A toss up between here and El Bravo, both about the same distance from Point A. (my house).  Delosantos wins because of the real margarita's.  My favorite entree item is the red beef burro, some of the best in town.  Excellent tequila selection.  What most Americans would consider \"authentic\" Mexican (Sonoran) food.  It is kinda ratty, and any restaurant that has been around this long might have trouble keeping their health dep't rating.  Edit:  After another year (and 5+ trips back), I have to give it another star, and amend my comment about the cleanliness of the restaurant.  First, the red beef chili burro is _still_ one of the best in town, I've been using that as my barometer for other Mexican restaurants, and this place still wins.  Also, they've cleaned up the dining area quite a bit, so I take back the 'ratty' comment.  Lot less dusty then I remember it, and maybe a fresh coat of paint, who knows.   Still, the prices are good, and the food is great.  What's not to love?",

So, we went there, and the staff was really nice but everyone was quite 'blah'.  Not too happy to be working or something? (Who really is, right?!). So not too many smiles coming your way if you go here. Anyway, the salsa/chips that they bring to the table were pretty good. They have hot and mild on the table and I didn't know which was which (usually I can tell), but found out right away! If you like hot salsa, then you'd like the one on the table!  But def. good flavors.   For dinner, I ordered the fish tacos (Tacos de carnitas is what the item was on the menu) . And the flavors were quite good and good portions I must say. However, the fish was overcooked so it was a little rubbery.   **Just a note, they do have a Vegetarian menu which I found very interesting at a Mexican restaurant. So there is food for everyone!  Overall I had a good experience here, the prices are a bit high to me, but that was really the only downfall. (And that I wish some of the staff would of been more personable.) But no matter, the company I was with,  was entertainment enough! :o)",

But... over the past 3 years or so the service has gone down hill fast!  On our final visit to Via's we met our waitress when she took our order and.. then never saw her again.  I had to get us more forks, ask for more Chips and Salsa, go to the bar for more drinks ect..  Then we the bill came there was a 20% gratuity added!!!  We asked if we could have the 20% taken off so we could tip what we thought the service deserved.... that's when we saw the waitress for the second time of the night... She said that she could not change the ticket since there were 6 or more people on the check...  At this point we were very upset and took our check to the front to pay and never come back.  As we were paying and complaining to the manager the waitress takes cash out of the drawer and hands it out to us and says  \"just keep the tip if you didn't like my service\" in a rude attitude way.    We told the manager to keep the tip since we would never be back to their establishment again.  Our family is very easy to please and we understand that restaurants get busy and service can not be 100% all the time.  But we do expect basic courtesy even if its the busiest night of the year.  I do miss the old Via's",

The salsa is very good and will make you keep dipping buckets of chips.   I had a Carne Asada buritto.   I liked it.  It tasted good (spicy, good meat, good texture, etc.).  The tortillas are good as well.   I say good a lot because I wasn't blown away by the taste.    One of my friend also had a carne asada burito and agreed with my assessment.  My other friend had the carne asada fajita plate and really liked it.  They have an EXCELLENT tequila selection.   You will not be disappointed.   There were equal compliments about the margaritas.    The ambiance is authentic mexican.   It is a family owned establishment with a long history in town.  It definately feels this way when you are in the restaurant.   Overall, this is an \"A-OK' place to eat and drink.  You'll enjoy it.",

Oh, and their machaca beef enchiladas with a little extra cheese will have you turning your car around by the time you reach Bethany Home and uncontrollably driving back for round two.*   Their service can be a little rough around the edges at times, but in the end it really doesn't matter. You didn't go to this place to bitch and moan about service; you went here to eat the best dinner you've had all week.   My only last piece of advice... eat a lot early on in the game, their dessert leaves a lot to be desired. They could get some legit honey for the sopapillas (vs. Kraft packets), and the fried ice cream is so-so.",

Well dear Via Delosantos, you're out!  This place is a hole in the wall, so you expect it to be a lil quirky,  but I always left feeling like it was more towards dark and dingy. The service was never anything to impress on my visits, on my last visit it took around 8 minutes for our server to show up in the first place and I was considering walking out all together.  The food here is mediocre.  Definitely nice sized portions, and there are a couple winners to choose from, but with a menu this large it is expected that there will also be some losers as well.  They pride themselves on their margaritas, and maybe I am just used to stronger pours elsewhere, but I found them to be pretty weak.  Basically, I find this place to be lackluster.  I am all about supporting the mom and pop, but there are plenty of other local Mexican restaurants to choose from, so all these people that swear by this place can keep it, I'll go elsewhere.",

I went to Sunnyslope High School, so this is my old 'hood.   If you like a place that's cozy and funky with nice staff and tasty Mexican food, go here! I asked our server whether she recommended the chicken or the shrimp fajitas, since I love veggies and chicken or fish. She recommended the shrimp. ($11.95)  Wow! I ate the whole plate...which should have been enough to have a small plate for leftovers. But no-oh! It was too addicting to not devour it fresh off the grill. Whatever they spread on the shrimp? I was in heaven.  The chips are decent. The chunky salsa was tasty. When I asked for a spicy bloody merry with a garden, they did put in two olives (no celery) and the server came back to ask if it was spicy enough. Nice, right?  It was yummy.   They have $3 house margaritas all day, every day. And 200 tequilas, which I can't report on because tequila gives me a hangover before I go to bed. And I hate hangovers. Just like you.  It's located just north of Dunlap on Central, on the west side. If you can't park in the lot, park on the side street.  Enjoy!",

The chips are a little thinner than we are used to but the salsa made up for it and then some! Definitely worth check out if in the area.",

    "text": "I was a little uneasy coming here just based on the area around however I quickly found that for real authentic mexican food, not a whole lot can compare.  What I love about this place is that it is True mexican food.  Places like Macayos and Garcias may be good but they try to slop so much chile and baja sauce on everything that it really loses out on the real flavor.   However, Delosantos is delicious.  I always get the Via Chalupas which is some sort of marinated beef (carne asada) soft tacos.  They are massive and comes with 3 per order with rice and beans.  They are mouthwatering.  I never have to add salsa or sour cream to them and have never been disappointed with those.  Most of my family loves to get some form of the tacos, enchiladas, and tostadas.  Just depends on what they want mroe of that night I guess.  And the cheese crisps may be simple but they are cooked great everytime.  I don't drink however others in my family will dine on pitchers of margaritas there and they absolutely love them.  I myself hate tequila so no thanks but to each their own.   The chips and salsa are staples but the hotter of the 2 salsas has the best flavor in my opinion.  The regular has too much cilantro in it for my liking and I could do without it.    I had tried the chimichanga initially going there and it ws good but nothing too special.  But overall this place has solid mexican food, a friendly staff, and although it might be small and you may have a few minutes to wait, it is well worth it.    I'm giving it 3.5 stars because I haven't tried the entire menu and I am very particular when it comes to Mexican food.  But from what I have tried, well done!",

    "text": "Our first visit to Via was about five years ago shortly after we moved into the \"Slope\" aka Sunnyslope.  Back then the waiters were surly, the food was good, and the 99 cent margaritas would knock you on your tukus.  About the only thing that's changed in that time is the margaritas are now $2.99, but you'll still get the same great food and the same surly service.  Well, that's not entirely True of the service.  It's been my experience that if it's a slow night and you have a female server, then your service will be top notch.  If it's busy or you happen to get a male server, then it can get a little frustrating.  I personally think they have the best mild salsa in town.  I always fill up on chips and salsa then feel like someone needs to roll me out the door because I'm so full after dinner.  The portion sizes are huge, so you can't go wrong there.  My favorite dish is the #3 combination, Green Chili Con Carne with rice and beans.  My only complaint is the same with every other Mexican Food restaurant in town, is the lettuce they use as a garnish on the plate.  I've said it before and I'll say it again...Heck I might even climb up \"S\" mountain and scream it from there...\"COLD LETTUCE HAS NO PLACE ON A HOT PLATE OF MEXICAN FOOD!\"  There, I feel much better now.  But seriously, you don't eat the lettuce, at least I don't, and even when I accidently do, it's hot and soggy.  Who likes that?  But I digress.  The bar is small, and always crowded.  The patio is nice if the weather is good.  Their list of tequilas is almost two pages long on their menu.  So if you're a tequila aficionado, then you should check it out.  If I had to rate Via on food alone, I'd give it four and a half stars.  If I had to rate via on service alone I'd have to give it two and a half stars only because it's spotty approximately half of the time.  So if I average them together Via would get three and half stars, but I'm going to round it up to four because the last few times, the service has been better and I really like the place.",

    "text": "Two colleagues and I visited this place for lunch today.  Only a so-so experience.  I have been to Via de many, many times having grown up in the Sunnyslope area.  They have consistently had good food and great margaritas.  But today's experience will make it tough to recommend.  We were seated promptly and had waters and chips and salsa soon thereafter.  We took some time to look at the menu and decided on 2 MaryLou's with red sauce and a green corn tamale.  They were all lunch specials that came with our choice of rice and beans.  The food arrived within about 10 minutes and everybody enjoyed their meal.    My major gripe about this place was the service.  Once our meals were delivered we didn't see a server again.  I had to stop a staff member who was passing by to get some water refills (we were all down to less than 1/2\" inch of water in our already small glasses).  No one came by to check and see if we were enjoying our meals or if we needed anything else to complete the meal.  When we were ready to leave, we had to go up to the front to get our bill and a to go box.  Via de is a place where you pay at the register but I still expect the bill to at least be dropped off.  They didn't appear to be exceptionally busy and I saw customers at two other tables looking around for someone to assist them.  Bad, bad service.  I don't know that I would head back when there are plenty of great Mexican food places in town with much better service.",

Lately I haven't been liking the red sauce that comes on enchiladas, but this red sauce was killer!! And served with the traditional rice and beans. I love when you get those great big plates for nothing of a price, and the free appetizer of chips and salsa (they gave two different salsas!). Also, they had house margaritas, small one was only $1.99, not even on happy hour!! they weren't holden back on the tequila either! Service was very nice. Highly recommend for some good cheap margaritas and food with flava!!",

It doesn't matter if you're a light weight like me or a fast eater, I'm sure you'll find yourself licking the plate clean. The beans were especially delicious and the chips and salsa were far better than somewhere like Chili's.  The servers were polite and attentive but not pushy, and it didn't feel awkward. There were a few flies by the window seats and that hurts the atmosphere of the restaurant, but it didn't really bother me much.",

    "text": "I would have never visited this place if I wasn't meeting a friend here. Not because it doesn't look appealing, but because I never knew they existed. I'm glad that my friend suggested this place because it was a pleasant experience!  The restaurant was medium sized; not too big, but not too crowded either. The staff was friendly, quick, and helpful. Their menu had many delicious items including a pretty good lunch menu. However, I ended up getting a dish from the dinner section of the menu.   They provide chips and two different salsas. One had small chunks of veggies in it and the other did not. The one that did not have chunks: wow, so good! I think I ate much more chips because of this salsa. The chips were nothing out of the ordinary. Just your regular Mexican restaurant chips.   I think this place broke the record of how fast you can get your food. Literally, they put fast food joints on notice with the speed. It was literally 5 minutes (or less) from the time we ordered to the time we were faced with our dishes. They were piping hot, the plates were very hot. The food was fresh, and delicious. The plating was very organized and clean. I would have thought that everything would be messy because they rushed in getting the food to us. But it was neat and tidy.   Food was great. The service was good. The restaurant was satisfactory. One thing that bugged me was that there were 4 or 5 flies that kept bugging us. It was like we were eating at a picnic. Otherwise, it was good overall. Give it a try.",

Not only do they serve delicious authentic Mexican food, they also have an impressively long tequila menu (They can boast a selection of more than 100 different tequilas! ). My son had just eaten ice cream before we arrived, so he was not planning to eat much. He loved his Supreme Quesadilla with shredded beef so much that he quickly devoured it...without letting me have a bite to taste. The vegetarian section of their menu is pretty extensive, so my husband was super happy; he practically licked the plate clean of his zucchini & corn enchilada with white sauce. Friendly service. Oh, and their Mexican rice is THE best I have ever had at any restaurant - so flavorful, homemade style!!",

We like the veggie section of the menu. They do not use lard, so I usually get a vegan bean burrito (no cheese). The tortilla is excellent! My husband likes the spinach enchilada. The chips are fresh and warm, and the salsas are above average.   The interior of the restaurant is perfect on a scorcher of a Phoenix afternoon. It's almost cave-like, especially if you are in a booth. The service has always been prompt and friendly.    While I appreciate the veggie section of the menu, maybe next time they print it they could mark what items are vegan, or could be made vegan? Other than that, this place is great!",

We walked in a 8:50PM and as the hostess started to seat us, another hostess came up and told us they close in 6 minutes, no other comment, just silence.    I asked if we could get served, no comment. So we left and went down the road to Ladera.  Ladera was very glad to have us. I really do like the food at Via De Los Santos and the margaritas, well you can't beat them for the price (get the hand mixed ones, well worth the extra $1)  But the treatment by the second hostess was unusual and off putting.  Thus a 2 star rating. My suggestion for the readers - Don't trust the on-line open/close times. My suggestion for the restaurant - If you are open until a given time, then happily serve your customers until that time, oh and be sure the information posted on line is accurate.",

I like the fact that there are vegetarian options and the prices are really reasonable.  One of my friends has been eating there weekly for several years now so that's a pretty high recommendation.

My mom ate at the restaurant 12 years ago and remembered it tasting amazing. She was right!  The restaurant had a lot of locals/ regulars than the typical travelers, like ourselves. The servers knew a lot of the people by first name, so that's pretty cool. My 12 year old nephew ate every last bite of his 3 taco carne asada plate! He said it was the best Mexican food ever. My 5 year old son had the open faced quesadilla and ate more than half (which is a lot for him), my step daughter ate every bite of her bean and cheese burrito. I had the veggie fajitas and there was so much food! Plenty for two people to share!! The veggies were fresh with carrots, onions, asparagus, green beans, potatoes... Such a mixture but believe me it was good! I'm not a meat eater so it was delicious for my liking. My mom got a fish dish that was delicious, cooked perfect with great flavor and not fishy tasting at all. The staff was friendly and welcoming even after my son spilled an entire water all over our table ( we actually had to move tables). We didn't go to the restaurant for decor, we went strictly for the food. So if that bothers some yelpers that's their opinion. Small and dated would be the only negative but I would still give this place a two thumbs up.",

Only things keeping it from being 5-stars is that the service can be hit or miss depending on who your server is and the seats (particularly the booths) aren't all that comfortable.

    "text": "Went here for dinner last night with a few ladies and was surprised by the diverse selection the menu provided.   However, being that I was adventureous in even trying a new place,  I settled on chicken enchiladas for dinner with their white queso. I questioned going to this place altogether due to it's unfamiliar location, and while initially questioning my sanity/safety, i have determined their food is DEFINITELY worth dying for :)  One of the ladies i was with raved about their food prior to us arriving, so my expectations were set pretty high. She also mentioned they had good margaritas, and to my pleasant surprise she was right! And, um...hello $2.99!! Their chips were good, their salsa was lacking flavor/spice (IMO), but their white queso was phenom! Perfect amount of flavor and spice. And yes, notice i said WHITE queso. Saw someone else mention they only use yellow cheese. Last i checked, i wasn't color blind. Forgive me, I digress.  The other ladies ordered a bowl of the green chili, and a burro. Didn't try the burro, but it looked/smelled great and the green chili was also a success. To finish things off, we had their fried ice cream with half honey & half strawberry. WOW! First time i've had it, and i'll definitely be going back if only for their $2.99 margaritas and fried ice cream. It really is the small things in life that make us women happy :)  The staff was entertaining, attentive, and polite. My only complaint about my whole experience was that on the menu the enchilada I ordered indicated shredded chicken, and it wasn't. It was chunked/cubed, and in turn made it very \"chickeny\" (it was STUFFED with Chicken) In addition, it was ALL dark meat. I prefer white meat over anything, but I suppose \"to each their own\". I think i'll just try a beef or cheese lada next time.  All in all, very good experience, and at the top of my list for best Mexican in the valley!",

    "text": "If you don't want to read the whole review, I'll sum it up in one sentence -- Via Delosantos only uses yellow cheese.  I went here about 4 years ago for a celebratory occasion, and was afraid to eat the food based on the smell of old grease and the look of the entrees on tables around. We ate on the patio, which is directly on Central Avenue, and after the horrid smell of grease & exhaust pipes, I couldn't wait to flee the scene.  Last year, I was unknowingly led back to this same place.  Years had passed, and I had completely forgotten about my vow to never return. This time, I was pleased.  It probably helps that upon entering my expectations were very low. I immediately was attracted to the kitschy Mexican artwork, their vast tequila collection on display, and of course, the christmas lights.  The salsa seemed fresh and was just the right amount of spice. They keep the chips & salsa flowing so be careful not to fill up.  The margaritas are really sweet, but they're cheap and will get the job done.  This is the kind of place where you stick to basics. Don't get fancy or try and order something healthy.  Get a chimichanga, burrito,  shrimp enchiladas, or a chile relleno, and if it's appropriate, get that sucker enchilada style. Be sure to have your Tums handy when done if you think you can eat a whole plate by yourself.  The portions are huge and totally splitable.  Oh, last word of advice, don't get the guacamole. It's super gringo, and has a ton of sour cream in it.  I'm giving this place 3 stars b/c it's a good value if you're sharing, they ambiance is very comfortable & amusing, and the service is very accommodating.",

Make sure you try one of the house margaritas, they are $2.99 all day, every day.  Salsa is really good and so are the chips.  This is an old school Phoenix Mexican restaurant, you can't go wrong.  I am docking it 1 star because I think the carna asada could be trimmed better, I have had some fatty pieces before in my meals.

Service: 2 stars, ALWAYS have bad service.  Food: 5 stars!!!  Yea!!!  I discovered this place when a good friend of mine took me here.  He said you will love it...I did...well, the food at least.  This restaurant is located in the Slopes, so come locked and loaded.  98% of the time this place is PACKED and their parking lot is super small, which means crappy parking in general.  I have had issues with this and have had to park in the neighborhood or in the establishment across the street.  The facility itself is rather small too, which is maybe why it always seems busy.  Upon entering I have found that it takes a while to be greeted.  The wait staff runs around frantically, although it only seems like I have ever seen only the 3 same servers each time I go.  The bar is located to your right and is small (sorry happy hour goers), and there are two separate seating areas, with seating outside.  For the tequila lovers, you have A LOT to work with!!!  Their selection is huge.  I often just close my eyes and point, and there is my shot for the evening.  They also have cheap margaritas too if that is your thing, with your basic beers on draft and bottle.  The ambiance is filled with old decor, but adds to the theme of the place, making it cozy in some aspect.  There is a large variety of food to select from on the menu.  I usually have the carnitas or carne asada.  ALWAYS delicious, never questionable.  I LOVE their chips and salsa.  To me, a good Mexican food restaurant in my book MUST have good chips and salsa to be considered worthy of return.  I just don't eff around with this.  They have this covered!  The only thing I can really complain about in this case is the service.  It always seems like it takes forever to be greeted, forever to have the wait staff take our drink order, then forever to return with them, then another eon to take our food order, and another eon for refills, and even longer for the check and processing.  Why is this?  Can someone please explain it to me?  If you are on a time crunch, this is NOT the place to go.  So, with that in mind, I leave you with the humbling message to try it out!  If you can tolerate their lack of prompt service and risky neighborhood, than you are a okay and ready for take off.  Bring a group of friends, have some shots, eat some good food.",

Mild salsa had great flavor with a slight kick. Hot salsa was just that. Hot but good.   Order a shredded beef chimi, kid's enchilada plate, #12 combo. (Taco, enchilada, rice and beans) ordered the bean and cheese dip appetizer to start. Don't bother with this one. It's just refried beans in a dish. Good beans but not really a dip. We added salsa and it was much better.  Food arrives. Everything looked good but instead of the kid's enchilada they brought 2 mini tacos. We didn't want to wait so my son said he'd eat them. I'd have thought we'd get a small discount for the mistake but nah. He ate them so no foul.   Husband's combo was average run of the mill mexican. Nothing wrong. Nothing special. My chimi was soggy but the tortilla mised with the guac and sour cream was good. Shredded beef tasted like something I'd cook in the crock on a long day.  Overall was a decent meal and a good value if you're looking for large portions. Just average though. Building is in dire need of a remodel. Missing tiles and chips in tables.  If in the area I would dine again but not go out of my way.",

Service from the moment you walk in greeted with a smile and menu. Which everything on it is delicious.   3. Atmosphere I don't talk about that much but I love the feel of this restaurant.   Via Delosantos thank you for being good in everything you do.   Your place makes this hungry Hawaiian happy.",

    "text": "Established in 1986, Via Delosantos is a local favorite. Located in the Sunnyslope area, it is our go to Mexican food restaurant. They have cheap margaritas, free chips and salsa, and good food for a reasonable price. They also have a ton of vegetarian options and all of your favorite Mexican food options. Try out the cantina section of the restaurant for more of a lounge feel or sit down with the family in the restaurant side. Everyone is very friendly but the service does tend to be on the slower side. If you're looking for an authentic style Mexican restaurant in the Sunnyslope neighborhood, Via is your place!",

I've never been disappointed! They are tasty and have the perfect amount of alcohol. Two is my limit lol. Throughout the years we have tried multiple items on the menu and have enjoyed all of it. My kids and I all love the red enchilada sauce. It's flavorful and has the right amount of spice to it. This is a place I will continue to refer people to when they want good Mexican food!",

We came in for lunch, and have mixed reviews on dishes!  Food; I got the shredded beef Chalupa and it was delicious- the masa was cooked to perfection and meat was yummy.  My daughter got the Pollo Fundido she couldn't eat it - now beware it does not come with white chicken so feel if it was the meat cut she liked it looks like it may have been delicious.   Service; super friendly and apologized for daughter not able to eat her dish - we didn't ask but she removed the dish from our bill.    I'd try it again soon to update review.",

Not over-the-top amazing, but if you want some basic Mexican fare, that's not fancy, this is a good choice. When you want a cold margarita but don't want to spend a fortune, come here. When you want super-friendly service, this is the joint! I like how they make their own taco shells instead of pre-made. My friend always gets the chimi. Salsas are pretty bland, but I love their chips. I'll keep coming back for the laid-back atmosphere and friendly people who work here and deliver cold margs for $3.50 a glass!",

This restaurant has a big variety of choices on their menu. All of us ordered our favorite burrito. Some restaurants even though their burrito meat is chunky, they have a tendency to be kind of tough. Not here, the meat is nice and tender. My better half ordered her favorite the green chili burrow, our son ordered his favorite as well. Today I stuck with the red chili con carne burrito with a side of beans. Sometimes, one just feels like having something simple.  Via Delosantos has been in business since 1986.  If you ever have a hankering for tamales this is the place to have a good tamale meal.  When you come into the restaurant there is patio seating and on a nice day could be just to your liking. Their bar has a huge variety of tequilas if that is your thing.  It's not that big of a place but, it can handle a lot of customers.  While we were there a bunch of employees put on some big sombreros and made a lot of noise and sang happy birthday to one of their customers, which I thought was nice to do that. When I say they made a lot noise, the whole restaurant knew what was going to happen.  They are located north of Dunlap Avenue and Central Avenue. Give them a try if you happen to be in the neighborhood.",

Pretty soon there were 4 groups behind us waiting as well.  After 10 minutes a table opened up and the waitress began to take us. Then the hostess told her to stop. Since we had a wheelchair we couldn't sit in that area and would have to wait for another table. So they gave it to the couple that came in after us. And did the same with the next table that opened. We left after that. The food is good - well, it was before - but if they can't follow basic ADA accommodations we'll never go back. There's no shortage of good Mexican food in Phoenix.",

After our emergency first aid kit of frozen margaritas and margaritas on the rocks, we relaxed our way through 2 bowls of salsa, chips and guacamole... then came the tacos and chili rellenos....  The atmosphere is a little of Rocky Point meets garage-Quonset hut shabby Mexican craft chic.  It is ultra casual, but in my opinion, NOT seedy.  It's colorful, and loud, and comfortable with liberal use of paint.  It was the perfect way to wind down after a long day.... I think I'll have one more.  Did i mention that the house Margaritas are $.99.  Good too",

Well, the chips are thin and salty yumness and I love the salsa.  They keep you filled up and aren't like other places which try to ignore an empty container!  Number 16 Combo is my guilty pleasure!  I have had it many times the way it's intended:  Chicken enchiladas with red sauce...but lately I've been getting it with Fundito sauce and I've gotta tell you:  I'm hooked!  Try it........it's a little more $$$ but SO worth it!  I haven't had desert since I'm gluten free but the size of the fried ice cream is Gigantic.  My daughter swears by it!  Man, I wish they were open right now...cravings have begun anew....",

Unfortunately, the majority of the menu consists of the same old Americanized-Mexican food that you will find at most Mexican places. There are a couple of standouts - the salsa verde chili Colorado was pretty good. The bowl of chili app was pretty good as well. Tequila selection is extensive. Overall, nothing really to rave about. A solid meal, at a decent price. Service was fast and friendly. I'd visit again.",

From the chips and salsa to the green chile cheese crisp to the endless parade of margaritas and shots of tequila right down to my bean tostada, out of this world tamale and cheesey cheese ensheelotta....  Well...  If it were legal to marry a restaurant, I would seriously consider courting Via Delosantos. But it's not. Can't marry a goat. Can't marry a gay. Can't marry a restaurant.   We had attentive and friendly service and was informed because it was 9:30 it was last call. So we ordered up! Went with my besties who are regulars so I feel as though we were extra pampered.   Extremely generous tequila list. Comfortable and cozy decor. Clean restrooms. Great company and delicious food.  As Arnold says \"I'll be backito!\"",

    "text": "I saw the reviews on Yelp and also was recommended by a local.  I'm from New York and there aren't a lot of great Mexican places there, so I was excited to get my hands on some authentic tacos.  My boyfriend and I ordered 6 chicken tacos.  While we waited for our order, we munched on some chips and salsa.  One of the salsas was tasty and had the right amount of spice.  The other tasted like the sauce from a Lunchables pizza.  We both agreed and joked about the taste but it didn't really bother us.  Here is where the two stars comes in:  We get our tacos and they are hard shell.  I really dislike hard shell tacos so I asked the waiter for an order of soft shell and offered to pay for my original order (I felt bad).  When the new tacos arrived, I was greatly disappointed.  The cheese looked like Kraft and both the lettuce and tomato looked like the cheapest produce one can buy at the grocery.  The worse part was the chicken.  The chicken was boiled and flavorless.  I forced myself to eat at least one.  My boyfriend felt the same way about his tacos.  The people there are really nice and sweet  but the food is really not good.  Maybe other things on the menu are better but after that experience, my boyfriend and I will not be coming back on our next trip to Arizona.  Fifty dollars down the drain :(",

It was @ shift change so he grabbed me a drink & then Mike (the new bartender) came on. There was an older man wasted @ the bar who was going on re how he'd been there drinking nonstop since 1030am ( it was now 6ish). He was yelling all kinds of profanities & talking about getting weed & getting high then says that he needs his keys so he can drive home. I said to Mike that he should order the man an Uber & he snarkly replies,\" he's not my problem!\" & walks away from me. Fast forward a few moments & the old man fell backwards off his barstool & slammed his head on the step & was OUT!!!  Ppl jumped up & literally Mike stepped right over him & carried on..... like it was no big deal!!! He never once acted like he cared. Fd comes & after they left, Mike came over completely cleared my table & gave me my check!!! I said is there a problem? He said, you need to go, I need that table..... now mind you in my 45+ years, I've NEVER had that happen!!! I said I didn't realize I was done. Then he says, you can sit w them ( referring to the couple in the booth next to mine WHO I DID NOT KNOW!!!) The whole thing was so bizarre!!! Then he tells the 2 guys who were sitting @ the high top next to my booth that they could have my booth!!! My head was spinning!!! I was seriously confused!!!

Then the lettuce, tomato, & cheese on it are perfect.  Order the tacos!  The rest is really good. Everything 4 or 5 stars.  The beer selection sucks. They have a good choice of Mexican beer but no American microbrews. The margaritas are a 4.  Did I mention the tacos?",

    "text": "Ate there yesterday and today 8/14 and 15/2018.  First day, day food was nice and hot, plate to hot to touch....  However, the waiter, left much to be desired... I saw him to take my order, the rest of the time, the bus person or the hostess helped me.Never once did he come to the table and ask how the food was, by the way, the hostess brought me my food, the bus person my drink, chips and salsa.  Mind you, I was the second person in, when they first opened, no business to get side tracked.  Never say the waiter again till he brought the check.  Second day, got there about 12:30...  had a few tables going, one woman working the dining room.  Same bus person, brought me my drink, chips and hot sauce and salsa.  Waitress walked by me multiple times, never acknowledging I was there. About 10 min in, a couple of older women came in, she greeted them and chatted like they were friends, she sat them in the booth next to mine.  Still no acknowledgement. She helped several other tables, again walking by me as if I was not there. Finally she came to the two women and took their order, then she finally came to me and took mine. I commented, I was beginning to think I was invisible, all she said was sorry.  About 3 min later she brought my food ( now, I go there for the good food, getting it has never been fast, always been on the slow side), was surprised, she placed it in front of me, no words and walked away.  Plate was cold, rice was cold and burro was just warm... Typically, I always have to blow on the food before eating or wait for it to cool down some... Not this time.  I had finished my glass of tea and the bowl of hot sauce and placed both on the edge of the table.  She walked by multiple times and never offered a refill.... All the while, she was, what seemed, overly attentive to the two ladies.  Finally, I was almost finished and after she had refilled the two ladies glasses, asked me if I needed more Tea. I said, yes, she filled, I thanked her, she turned and walked away. No words.  Then came the bill,  she just appeared out of no where, laid it on the table and walked away. No asking how the food was, if I wanted anything else, desert or such.... She did however, ask the ladies multiple times how they were doing. . So, I finished the last couple of bites, got up and went to the register.  The regular older white haired woman, who I see most of the time I go there, was there.  She rang me up, gave me the receipt to sign and add a tip if so willing.   I wrote down 0 on the tip line and when she went to take the receipt, I said, I did not leave a tip, she said yes, I see that, thank you... I asked her if she wanted to know why, She did not say a word, simply turned her back on me, literally.  So I said WOW rather loudly and left. I have never had worse service or been treated as if I was an inconvenience to serve. Love the food, so am left with the dilemma of going back simply for the food and have crappy service, or going someplace else where they appreciate their paying customers and the food is equally as good... There are several places with as good if not better food,  Rito's on 14th St and Roosevelt, Rosita's Place on McDowell and about 22nd or 23rd St,  Comedor D'Guadalahara on South Central and i-17, Sylvia's El Capitol on Van Buren  St ... Irma's Kitchen on 15th Ave and Roosevelt...  all serve food as good or better and great customer service.   I simply go to where ever I am closest to when I have time for lunch...",

The interior is nothing to write home about. Maybe the divey look is what they are going for so I won't knock it. Surprisingly, they have a decent vegetarian menu. I ordered the veggie fajitas, no rice and no beans. I'm used to the fajita being served in a mini skillet that's sizzling hot with goodness......NOPE. What I received was a hot plate with diced vegetables, a side of corn tortillas and a side of guac & sour cream. The veggie mixture consisted primarily of tomatoes and carrots. Where are the bell peppers??? The veggies were not marinated or seasoned so I relied heavily on the salsa to punch up the flavor. My husband got the carne asada plate which came with rice & beans and tons of cheese melted on top. He too relied heavily on the salsa. I will say that the wait staff was friendly.  If you want Americanized Mexican food then go here. If you want an extensive tequila selection then go here. I don't care for either therefore I will not be back.",

My two go to dishes are the the beef machacha (sp?) with eggs and red chili beef tamales. Both are amazing. The tamales are heaven. Creamy in texture, beef falling apart, and super moist. I like them with enchilada sauce too. They don't need it, but it is YUMMY. Lastly, it's a kitchy gringo place but still fun. A great spot in Sunnyslope.",

Plus a $3 margarita or three... the first time we went for a business meeting our server was about 150 years old, but bless her sassy heart she was fun and had no patience for us until we sassed her right back, then she was great. Since then, the younger staff has been great, even when we wipe them out of chips!",

    "text": "After Don Jose's on 36th Street and Thomas closed, I spent a year at home in tears, venturing out to eat mexican food very rarely, and then a friend of a friend turned me on to Via.  This has been my saving grace, and the variety on their menu makes it easy to take even the pickiest of my friends.  Being a fairly routine person myself, I regularly enjoy their mexican pizza, but have also tried and enjoyed their chalupas, tostadas, burros and enchiladas.  It's difficult to get a seat in here on a Friday or Saturday night, but I'm usually there in the early evening on a Friday for a much needed (and very affordable!) margarita!  Definitely a great little hole on the wall place!",

The chips were thin and salty, but ours were a little on the greasy side.  The salsa is good and the food is very tasty.  I had a Machaca beef chimi;  great flavor and all the fixins on top, but the meat needed to be cut up a little more...My son and I thought the meat was to stringy. My other son, he had the cheese enchiladas and beef taco...EXCELLENT.  House Margarita's where YUMMY, YUMMY! All in all, we went home \"happy gringos\" with our bellies FULL.",

    "text": "If you are in a rush and need to get in eat and get out, Via is not the place for you!  I've been here 6-7 times and every single time the service has been so slow!  I'm pretty understanding when you are short staff'd and all, because one time it was pretty apparent no one showed up for work that day. Seriously, I saw our waitress once in 10-15 minutes, and it was during the day, so there were not that many people there.  It was a little embarassing because I'm pretty sure I suggested the place, to a couple of people who had never been.  That was just one time though, but I will admit, they are pretty slow all the time. I can handle the service so anytime I'm in the area, this is the first place I suggest, because I really do like the food though. Its similar to the mexican food I grew up on at La Palma, which is now a CSV, so any mexican place I eat at is compared to LaPalma.  I miss you LaPalma, especially your take home Hot Sauce mix!  I've only been here once at \"diner\" time, and it was packed!!!  I usually go for some lunch, to sit in the tiny bar area with my corona, lite of course.  I need to go back on a cool day to sit on the patio and try the margarita's enjoying the fact that I will not have a waitress/waiter bugging me all the time.",

I ordered it with the green chili sauce and it was bland.  I ordered a \"top shelf\" margarita and specified Patron Silver tequila, but I'd bet that wasn't what was in my glass.  I couldn't really tell because it was an extremely light pour.  And the service...OMG!  Everybody working there moves at a positively glacial pace!  I had to ask repeatedly for water, salsa, etc.  And I didn't even consider a to-go box.  The final straw was when the busboy scraped leftovers from a stack of plates onto my plate right in front of me! Yuck!  That was disgusting!  I had intended to check out this place for happy hour, but unless I just want to sip tequila (after I watch the bartender pour it), I'll go elsewhere.  I don't understand what all the rave reviews are about.",
