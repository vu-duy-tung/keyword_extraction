From our entrance into Orange Sky, the ambience and service was great. Everyone was very welcoming and more than friendly/courteous. Our service was exceptional and the food was equal! Our party had several dishes- salmon, filet, oysters, scallops, lamb, sweet potatoes, asparagus etc. All was prepared and cooked to perfection . Several times throughout the meal, our party would comment on how delicious their meal was. We finished the meal off with creamed brulee , chocolate mousse and sherbet. The scenery at sunset added to the overall enjoyment of the evening. In all, this dining experience was everything and more. Than we expected. We all will certainly be back!",

We showed up at 7:50p for an 8p reservation in a private booth. There's only 8 of them in the whole restaurant. The hostess comes to us at 8:05 and says our table is ready and begins to bring us to the back of the restaurant, not where we had reserved. When we said this isn't where we reserved, the bitchy hostess says \"We're fully committed.\" What kind of a response is that especially when we reserved a spot. She said if we wanted to wait longer, we can have a private table. We decided to wait, and wait, and right before my 31st birthday the manager came over and said its going to be another 20-30 min. It's now 8:50p. I explained the situation and he apologized and said he'd comp a few drinks and apps. We settled and sat at a table and 10 minutes in he came over and said he'd love to move us to a private now because the couple before us left. He continued to explain they were there for almost 5 hours. We moved and began to order food.   Salt Block shrimp was good not great. Very fishy tasting so you can tell it wasn't as fresh as it could be.   Black truffle gnocchi and crushed potatoes were bland and needed salt.   12oz tenderloin was actually pretty good. I ordered medium and it was on the rare side.   The pan roasted chicken was really good.   Waitress was very nice but seemed robotic and not personable.   $250 later, 2 stars.",

I had the halibut and it was good but again nothing I would order again. We had the sommelier come over to help us pick out a great bottle of wine. At first sip, after the cork was broken when the server opened it,  it was good but needed to open, well this bottle needed at least 3-4 hours to open, more time than we had for dinner. I finally asked the waiter for a decanter to see if that would help. I was never complaining because that happens when you order a bottle of wine. My husband finally just asked the server to bring me a different glass of wine because the meal was done and I really did not enjoy the wine. A manager, Nichole, came over that is clearly fresh out of being a server and had the attitude that we were trying to get something comped. I was blown away by how rude she was and could clearly care less.  I come from Fine Dining and 15 years of F&B so no one was trying to get anything comped but the treatment from the manager will definitely keep us away for good.",

The views are beautiful at every angle of the restaurant from the bar to the main dinning areas. The sunset was absolutely gorgeous while we ate our delectable meals. I did not drink any alcohol while there, but my foodie friends loved their glasses of fine wine. The french pressed coffee and their deserts looked and smelled amazing as well, although I did not partake because I was absolutely stuffed.  I had the Red Chile Beef Tips as my main entree with two sides: The Kale and  mushroom  and the asparagus.   I would love to go back and enjoy something different next time. Each person at the table ordered one of the appetizers and they were all delectable in their own ways.  I am a fan!!  Love,  The East Coast Foodie",

Drinks and wines by the glass are about $15 each. We were then escorted to our table/ booth that looked west as the sun was setting. Great views!! For dinner, we started with burrata and pest that was amazing. Prices of appetizers and salads were about $10-15 each. Entrees start at $30 for scallops and fish, scallops were the best I have ever had. Steaks are priced starting at $33 for small filet, $38 for rib eye and $40 for a kobe flat iron, there were others but i cannot recall. My husband ordered a regular filet that was $40 and perfectly cooked. We did not order dessert , so I am not sure what was on that menu. We will definitely be back.

He also brought me to Sassi that weekend, so clearly he was trying to give me an impression of Scottsdale by exploiting my love for good local cuisine. Guess what it worked, I've been back to visit three times since (okay the guy has a good thing to do with it).  Orange Sky has a few really great things going for it. The first is the picturesque view. Second is the little nook-like banquettes that can be reserved which are like private little romantic crescent. I'd be lying if I said we didn't have a mini kiss fest. Plan to have a 3 course meal in order to meet the minimum at these tables. Third is the impeccable and attentive service (but not too attentive as to interrupt our make out session).  The menu is fairly traditional with steak, seafood and seasonal ingredients. The only thing I didn't care much for was my cocktail. Very strong which I'd assume has something to do with an older crowd that frequents the casino.

I have no problem paying $42 for a rack of lamb, but not when the dish has been defrosted and their are no side dishes.  It was over cooked and tasteless meat, but I must say the glaze was good.  Same thing goes for the sea bass.  It was either old or frozen fish. Lacking any sign of freshness.  The sweet potato side dish was almost laughable.  They literally cut it, threw butter on it and then through a tablespoon of goat cheese on top for $10. The views save this place from the over price, underwhelming food experience. Forgot to mention, after having a drink in the lounge (which we waited 15 min for), I was carded at the table which turned into a scene when they had to take my ID to get scanned (35 years old!).",

Atmosphere is more like a tourist patio at a golf club with a great view.  Food is good but not worth the price.  For my job I have to entertain at least 2 times a week. So I know what food and service is valued at. This is a poor value.  Add in the Smokey walk through the casino and it gives you a feeling of cheap.  Then we had a group of 5 adults and two middle school kids. They determined this to be a large group and forced a 22% tip on us.  I do large groups every week.  I have never seen a 22% mandatory top.  18-20% is customary.  In 25 years of entertaining I have never seen this.  Just goes to show you my first point.  They think the service and food is way better than it actually is. I'm just disappointed in the entire experience.  View or not, I will never return.

I know not everyone needs one but how about 2 or 3 menus, especially with the long list of special cocktails and wine, a girl's gotta read the list!  The timing of the ordering and drinks seemed to lag.  I've been to many fine dining establishments before and I get that things are staggered but the first girl got her drink 25 minutes before the last girl got hers.  The food was OK.  I ordered the filet \"Oscar style\" thinking it was only an extra $12-18 bucks for a lump of crab meat (along the lines of other high end steak houses), the kitchen gave me a King crab leg with a $29.00 adder on top of my steak.   It's definitely a place to impress or celebrate but if you are truly a foodie, I'd keep the cash and spend it elsewhere.",

    "text": "Not your typical steakhouse menu. More of a specialty cuisine restaraunt since they have four cuts of beef and one is a cut that is used for fajita meat. No filet or bone in ribeye. The elk loin was very good, however it is served sliced so if its undercooked as mine was you would be left to wonder how will you put it back on the heat. Im not a fan of any slab of meat being cut up and served to me so a heads up on the menu would've been nice. Service was excellent and atmosphere was very elegant. Spent $240 on one Cesar salad and two elk loins, $13 brocollini and a very over cooked baked potato. Also had four beers. Not much for your money. You are paying for atmosphere and view. At night view is nothing but lights.",

The down side:  large table of approx 12 people in main dining room, obviously over served, incredibly loud.  Inexcusable behaviors for other diners in this type of restaurant.  Additionally the open dining room room is adjacent to the bar.  There were several loud drunk patrons just feet from our table. Again not what one would normally expect in this type of restaurant.   Consider that this is in a casino and as such will be subject to a different clientele than most high end restaurants.",

We started with a blood mary which thanks to our server, Ellysa, was made perfectly --nice and spicy.   Cesar salad was made with avocado dressing with avocado oil and while it sounded interesting, it was just ok.  The star of the show was the Elk, a medium rare filet (of Elk) on a bed of polenta with mushrooms and onions.  Never had Elk before and never had anything so good either.  The skirt steak was charred yet delivered medium rare.  Such a tender piece of skirt steak that I couldn't get over it.  The sides were amazing--- green chili mashed potatoes were so good I would venture to say that they were the best mashed potatoes I ever had.  The asparagus with garlic and lemon zest was most enjoyable.  Loved the flourless chocolate cake but the milk chocolate mousse not so much.  The service was impeccable yet friendly.  Thank you Ellysa.  We appreciated your great service.",

Eat lots of bread because they bring everybody's food out at the same time. And by then you are starving. And unhappy! Grumpy and hungry.

This time however ate out in main area...Christopher was our waiter and he did a great job serving us.  I usually have fish, but Christopher recommended the fillet and boy was I glad he did!!!  It was way better than the steak I had only a few weekends ago at Dominick's Steak house and about half the price.  This steak melt in your mouth...  I am a local Realtor in town and clients always ask me where to go...now I will replace Dominick's with Orange Sky.  Two thumbs up for Christopher as well, we will request  you in near future as I am already thinking about how good it was!!!",

I enjoyed the unique side dishes so much that I forgot about the steak in front of me. If you order a steak entree, ask for the sampler of different flavored sea salts.     I usually have leftovers from a steak dinner at a restaurant. There were no leftovers and that was not because of lack of serving size. The food was flavorful. I enjoyed the kale with shiitake mushrooms. The steak was served with a small Japanese pepper on the side. It was a fun and creative menu.  I would give the restaurant 5 stars if the bathroom didn't have such a tiny little trash can for such a large place that size ( the trash can was the size of my powder room trash can). There were disposable towels spilled all over the floor. Also, I felt like I was sitting way too close to the neighboring table. I could here everything the people seated next to me were saying and the couple was not speaking loudly at all.   I found it interesting that the restaurant's bathrooms had sharps needle disposal containers in the restrooms. I have never seen that in a restaurant before.  It was a great dining experience overall.",

    "text": "I'm usually not one to complain when a great meal is paid for by someone else, in this case my generous brother in law Rick Randall. Tuesday September 30th was his birthday and we were all in a great mood looking forward to some excellent food!  I will also state right up front, the food was pretty great, but read on to see why I give it 2 stars...  The view from the top of the casino is really awesome, and upon first entering the restaurant you are taken aback by the shear size and fantastic aesthetics this place offers. Based on the ambiance, this was going to be good!  The wine list is incredible, and includes some very unique \"off the beaten path\" greats such as Rob and Sarah Hammelman's SAND RECKONER Malvasia Bianca, 2010, which made the San Francisco Chronicle's Top 100 Wines in the USA a couple years back. The reason that's remarkable is because it's an Arizona Wine, which have traditionally gotten very little \"love\" in local high class eateries.  Upon arrival about 10 minutes early for our reservation at 7pm, we waited nearly 15 minutes to be seated at our table. Once sitting, we were brought water, and waited another 10 minutes before our waiter showed up.   Unfortunately, the (delayed) first impression was further tainted by his breath, which was scorching. I couldn't help but wonder how a person who's job it is to serve food and drink could allow their breath to be that repulsive without noticing.   I didn't get our waiter's name, but he was a middle-aged hispanic man and my first discussion with him was focused on the fact that I (unfortunately) have Celiac Disease.   Not \"gluten-intollerance\", but the real clinically diagnosed version of the disease.  He ASSURED us up and down that any of the fresh meats, cheeses, vegetables, etc. were gluten-free, and that he would \"personally talk to the Executive Chef\" to make sure my food was properly prepared and didn't contain any gluten ingredients.  Long story short, they brought out the Fondue Platter, which I very much enjoyed dipping my veggies into. At one point, as they were clearing the various appetizers I asked him to leave the fondue cheese because I wanted to use it as a garnish for my rib-eye (which was perfectly cooked and delicious, by the way).   The waiter, knowing I was Gluten-Free exclaimed cheerfully \"WHY NOT? LOL\".  About 10 minutes after eating that cheese (along with some fresh seafood, which was also very good) I started to feel nauseous.   Our waiter had walked over and asked me how everything was, and I said \"fine other than the fact that I feel like I'm going to toss my cookies\". He just blankly turned and walked away in spite of the fact I actually said this with a smile on my face.  Within 15 minutes of eating a few bites of the steak with the delicious fondue cheese on it, I started to feel violently ill and had to excuse myself from the table.  I walked over to the single toilet by the kitchen, locked the door, and once inside proceeded to expel my guts for what seemed like an eternity. It was really unpleasant and embarrassing due to the stench and sound I was generating, to say nothing of how I felt physically (for two days).  Long story short, that cheese in the fondue had Grolsch Beer in it. A gluten-rich source of explosive vomit and diarrhea for me.  Our waiter was utterly incompetent and it cost me dearly.  I think the food here is delicious and deserves to be served by people who know what they are doing, and take verbally communicated food allergies VERY seriously.  I would give the food 4 stars (not 5 only because the appetizers are jokingly small for how much they cost) and an overall 2 stars for the explosive experience and incompetence of the waiter.",

    "text": "So it was my husband's birthday and he wanted a restaurant with ambiance.  OK - We had heard good things about Orange Sky so I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance.  2 weeks is not enough time if you want a premium seat.  The view is beautiful (if you can see it - we could not from our table) and you must spend at least $ 200 to even reserve a premium table.   Then we get there and immediately told to go to the bar and have a drink.  What is the point in making a reservation if I have to wait.  (In my opinion it is just a ploy to get you to spend $ on $ 15 drinks... I'm just sayin) .  While we were waiting for the table another couple came in and was immediately seated.  That really pissed me off.  I finally made my husband go up to the hostess and complain.  About 3 minutes later the manager came over and took us to our table.   When we frequent these types of restaurants we expect a certain level of service.  Our waiter was nice but not very attentive.  It is the little things - I asked for ice tea no lemon and sugar - sure enough my tea had lemon in it.  Then he handed me the sugar packet dish.  I told him 3 times I don't need sugar but he never took the dish away.  I asked for bread and that didn't come until our meal was served.  Then he brought us the check and he never came back for payment.  Another waitress came over and took it for us.  He showed up as we were walking out the door.    The food was o.k.  Of course the waiter recommended the most expensive item on the menu and my husband ordered it.  (Did I hear the word - UPSELL?)  He had the rib eye with crab and I had the scallops.  They were o.k.  But was it worth $ 200?  I don't think so.",

We sat in the main dining area and the views at sunset were spectacular. The food was creative, nicely presented and everything we ordered was DELICIOUS!  Our server was Maggie, and she did a wonderful job and helped make our dining experience special. We each ordered a couple of cocktails, had one appetizer, then each ordered a main dish and we split two large side dishes and our bill was just over $200 including the tip. We don't typically spend that much when we dine out, but this was such a nice evening for us that we will definitely go back. We're even thinking it would be fun to get some friends together and go for drinks and appetizers and just enjoy the view! Go check it out!",

I did some advanced planning and enjoyed a great Valentine's Day experience at Orange Sky.  The red wine, oysters and tenderloin were a perfect addition to the city lights and soft fire lit ambiance.  The building was illuminating a bright red heart that you could see from several miles away.  After the Valentine's dinner I was given a beautiful red rose.  Very nice touch by the staff.  I loved it!  I give it a 4 star because for the price, I feel they could step it up a notch with the plate presentation.  It's very plain and unappealing.  A few pretty garnishments would be more visually pleasing.   I plan on returning and I highly recommend Orange Sky for any special occasion or a great dinner out.",

My boyfriend ordered the Seasonal game which was Elk and I ordered the Salmon. Best Salmon Ive ever had and the Elk was indescribable.   Our waiter was very knowledgeable and kept our water glasses full. He was there when we needed him and gone when we didn't. Perfect service. I would love to come back.   My only concern is they called me the night before our reservation to see if we were still going to show up, i said yes and then she asked me if it was a special occasion and I told her it was my boyfriends birthday. I asked if they could do anything special for him and she told me she would bring him a complimentary desert. Unfortunately the dessert never showed up. I don't know if they forgot or if the lady that called me just didn't put it in my reservation notes. But the experience was so amazing that i didn't even mind. and the food was so delicious that we didn't even want dessert anyways.",

For our entrees my wife ordered scallops and I ordered a steak, which we both shared.  All the items we ordered were perfect.  The only thing that prevented this from being a five star review was the fact that a place like this had no draft beers - only bottled.",

We had arrived at Orange Sky and asked the hostess where the best seating is for a view. She suggested the dining room instead of the lounge. We had explained that we wanted just desserts and drinks. She led us to the dinning area. We told her once more that we didn't want a full course meal and she walked us back to the lounge area. Really annoying!! Why won't you accommodate your patrons that wants to enjoy dessert with a nice view??   We decided to still sit at the lounge. Our waitress grabbed is the wrong menu. And took awhile to come back to check on us for our orders. By that time we were so turned off that we left.",

    "text": "This review is kind of difficult for a couple of reasons. Nearly every high point was off set with a low point to balance it out.   First the ambiance and location (15th floor looking west) is stunning. On the other hand having to walk through the casino to get to the elevator to take you upstairs is quite the opposite. Additionally, while others have talked about how quite it is, rarely hearing anyone else, etc. this was not our experience. We heard people screaming/partying, conversations from both of the booths neighboring ours and the like - not terribly upsetting but not what we were expecting.  Lastly the view has you looking out over the parking lot... Would it have killed them in the planning stage to put the parking lot, garage in the field facing the opposite direction?  The food, oh the food. My fiancee and I seem to have a problem in Phoenix/ Scottsdale - we find many more places serve outstanding appetizers than do serve great entrees. Such was the case here. We had a great corn soup and a tasty salad. Both got us excited for our main course - mine a 17 oz. Rib Eye with garlic parmesan   fries, hers a filet served Oscar Style with white cheddar whipped potatoes. However, while the steaks were decent, we were expecting more than decent. When the plate is more than $40 a person I expect to be wowed. The fries on the side were so overpoweringly garlic they were inedible - even to the point that the swamp of garlic they were resting in threw off the whole course. The whipped potatoes were pretty good.   We had a bottle of wine to make certain we hit the minimum charge of $125 and were impressed with the selection.   The last point was a dessert they threw our way due to it being our anniversary which came out on a plate with \"Happy Anniversary\" written out in chocolate. It was a nice touch, as was the personal greeting wishing us a happy anniversary as soon as we were taken to our table. This is what saved it from a 2 star review.  Take Away: For the money you can find better steak in Scottsdale at a fairer price without having to drag yourself through a grungy, overcrowded casino.",

My wife had the King Crab legs (8oz after being deshelled) and she said they were amazing. The lemon seasoned asparagus and mashed potato sides were quite tasty. The large wine selection would have made it difficult to choose if I didn't immediately go for the Pinot Noir as my go-to choice, which was excellent as well.",

    "text": "This review is for a venue used for dinner programs with a speaker.    First of all the I was frustrated with the parking.  They had an event going on, which is probably pretty common here, so parking was pretty full.  I decided to take my chances with the parking garage and I'm pretty sure I got the last spot on the top level.  I was at the north end by the stairs and saw the sign for the elevators so I took the stairs since it was only the 3rd level.  That was a mistake because that led me down a long walkway to the employee entrance!  I went in and they told me I had to go back through the parking garage.  Luckily there was a golf cart that took me to the front entrance.    The signs led me to the Orange Sky on the 15th floor.  I mad it up there and was escorted to our meeting room.  It was an interior room, long and pretty narrow with a long table with seating for 10 on each side and one on each end.  I sat at the end away from the speaker.  By the time I finally got to the room it had taken me 50 minutes to get there from home, half the time after arriving looking for parking.  The room was quiet but was kind of dark.  I could not even make out the speaker, he was just a dark silhouette against the screen.  The screen was also partially blocked from the the lights above the table.    I got there 10 minutes before the meeting was to start but by then the appetizers were pretty much gone.  It didn't matter too much because the closest was 5 feet away from me.  The seafood app. was about 15 feet away and a couple of cheese plates 20.  I can't comment on the quality of the apps because I didn't have the opportunity to try any.  Tip!  Since putting the apps on the table don't give everyone an opportunity to try them why not have a separate table against the wall to put the apps and serve buffet style. Simple! Since the apps are served before the lecture would not interfere.  They way they did it is not working!  The selection was less than at most other venues, only two entrees.  Most have 3, usually salmon with the chicken and steak.  I had the steak which was decent.  Not USDA prime but not bad and it had grill marks like a steak should!  They didn't ask how we wanted it cooked but was medium plus.  I'd prefer a tad less cooked but close.  The chicken looked good.  The skin looked crispy!  After seeing the chicken I think I would have gone with that.    After the talk I left so didn't get to see much else but the bar area looked pretty nice and was full at 8:45pm with live music.",

We enjoyed the Oysters as a starter and then shared the 12oz Beef Filet which was seared perfectly and accompanied by a flight of sauces, since we couldn't choose which one we wanted the Server let us sample them all!

It could possibly have been a 5 Star but I was sick and couldn't taste the food that well.  The starter bread was my least favorite item.  Not sure why it was a very dull and cold bread.  I usually fill up on bread before my entree comes but this time I hardly ate half a piece.  I ordered the elk since I've never had it before.  While it was tender and lean like our waiter described, it was too lean for my liking. I ended up drooling over and stealing part of my husband's delicious ribeye accompanied with CHIMICHURRI (my weakness). The sauce on the elk was also a sweeter sauce which is not my thing.  I would say a different person would have enjoyed it more but I should have stuck with the good old fatty ribeye.  The shareable sides were very good. We got the cooked kale and rosemary crushed potatoes.  We were ready to order dessert but then they brought out a complimentary anniversary dessert!  The dark chocolate mouse cake/tart was delectable though a bit small but not complaining!  I would like to come back and try on a day my tastebuds are in tip top shape.",

Service was polite and attentive, the view was incredible, and the food was delicious.  Pricey, but very very good.  We went here for my birthday, and we were brought a little birthday dessert after our meal.  We started with oysters, I had an elk dish, my wife had scallops.  All were terrific.  We also really liked the sides we chose - the potatoes and the mushroom tart.  Good drink list as well, especially if you like cocktails.  Overall we'd say we'll return, but can't make it a regular \"go-to\" place as it's not cheap.",

    "text": "The Orange Sky is located on the 15th floor of the Talking Stick resort.  It offers an excellent panorma view.  When making reservation they ask if you are celebrating a special occasion, indeed, it was my boyfriend's birthday!   Made reservations at 5:30 and from the moment we were seated, we were warmly greeted and had excellent customer service.  Seated in a plush dining room with crisp white linens in a semi private booth.  I felt as if I was in my own little world.  Private and yet views of the valley and the entire dining room.  Our timing couldn't be better with the sunset views, once the sun went down, the lighting changed and it felt cozy and VERY romantic.    The antipasti plate is so delicious with the roasted squash hummus and the bacon wrapped dates.  Great to share for two and definately recommend to try.  I also ordered the Rib Eye Steak, it was solid, nothing remarkable but it was good.    The pianist gives a super loungey feel, 5 stars for him alone.  You'll definatley leave with good vibes and and would definatley return. Classy and sophisticated.  Oh btw, if you're up for some dancing, after the restaurant closes, the lounge area before entering the dining room, turns into a dance floor at about 10:30pm (no cover).  Nothing over the top or too crowded but it was a great place to get your groove on afterward.  I was not expecting that at all.  It was a great night overall.",

However, we ate there on Saturday night with a party of 12, and a few of our party came late. Our waiter seemed annoyed and dismissive. Very hard to get a drink and the lack of friendliness rubbed us the wrong way. Automatic 22% gratuity, and for that I would've expected A LOT better service. Our meal alone was $160 and there were four other couples with us... Who ordered a lot more food and drinks. A hefty bill and tip I'm sure.

The highlight is the views, and we did not even have the private dining facing the windows, we were seated in general dining area, but hostess placed us on a good spot. Apologize if harsh review, but supposed to be about the food not sightseeing.",

    "text": "I am a native Phoenician, and have experienced many great upscale steak restaurants in the valley...and let me tell you, this was not one of them!  I thought it would be a nice surprise to take my wife here on New Years Eve. My first mistake was not having the knowledge that it was a fixed menu, but also not seeing anything about that on their site.  The fixed menu was $135.00 per person, and nothing on their prepared menu was appealing to either one of us. The appetizer choice sounded great, and was lobster, but when they brought it out, my wife started laughing, because the lobster was a piece the size of a penny...we were wondering what happened to the rest. The salad was something we both had never seen before, it looked like oregano with a little dressing mixed in. The main entree we picked was Sea Bass, and actually that was delicious, and prepared very well.  We both were hoping for some type of steak, but all they were offering was Elk and Buffalo, which neither one of us cared for. The dessert was something with peanut butter in it. As you probably figured we left the table hungry.  The biggest surprise was when we received our bill, and were shocked when the total was $460.00...For Two! We did get 3 drinks with our meal, 2 wines and 1 specialty cocktail, but $460.00...Wow!  Oh, that did include a 22% gratuity that they automatically added.  It was a very slow time at 6:00, and the servers were just standing around staring at our table...very uncomfortable.  When we walked in to the hostess stand there were 8 hostesses waiting to greet us...a little overkill.  The views are great here, but only if you are sitting next to a window, and the sun hasn't set, but other than that, the inside of the restaurant isn't very appealing or comfortable. I don't think we will ever dine here again, especially with so many great steak and fish restaurants in town. This does not even come close to Maestro's, Dominik's or Steak 44. At least at these restaurants we leave very satisfied and with a bill half that price.",

The bar at the entrance is clean, well stocked, has a good bartender, and prices are reasonable.  The restaurant has a some really nice private dining options.   For couples, there are small 2 person booths that look out over the city, in a private area. They  have their backs to a hallway, curtains separate the booths themselves, and the view is fantastic.  For groups, their are options private dining rooms which look like they could seat 15+ people.  The general dining area is broken into balcony and indoor seating, both are spacious, and have a view of the open kitchen, something I like.  There is also a bar in the main dining area which looks over the kitchen, which is pretty cool.  The service was very good, and even while our waitress was busy, others came by to ensure we were taken care of.  We ordered their small seafood platter as an appetizer, which included King Crab, Muscles, Shrimp, and Oysters. All of it tasted fresh and was great. Their cocktail sauce is also fantastic.   For  dinner, I had the 17oz sirloin, ordered medium-rare. We also shared sides of their smashed potatoes and cauliflower gratin.  The steak was seasoned well, and cooked perfectly. The sides were also excellent. I  also was lucky enough to try the Scallops as one of my dinner mates had ordered them, they were velvety soft and delicious.  I thought the pricing to be really fair, even cheap, compared to what I expected and what I got. It was a very good experience overall, and I will return.",

The less than good points, 1) Pricey, should have 4$ rating vice 3$. 2) Food cuts were good quality but the experience was soured by the rather meager serving sizes and spoiled by over spicing.  There was a hot and spicy component to nearly every entre'.  The soup, the salad, the sides, the steak, the steak sauce, and even the shrimp and scallops were notably hot and spicy.  It was almost if the Chef was from India and added curry or peppers to every component.    Service for such a high end place was OK but could have been better in explaining things and interacting.  You are paying for the views and ambience.  IMO to be an above average high end restaurant, this place needs to change the chef and give bigger portions for the money they ask.",

    "text": "A Christmas dinner is not like any other meal. So when my friends suggested Orange Sky I was beyond excited! The ride up to the restaurant was fun in itself. The elevator with an open view to the mountains was breathtaking, but alas, too short.  We arrived a early for our reservations, so we made friends with a Richard at the bar. Although already helping a number of guests he was eager to attend to our needs. A visit to Orange Sky really could be complete with someone like Richard. Such a gem! Well versed in his product line and so, so polite!   Note: There are *two* bar areas at Orange Sky. There is the large area when you step off the elevator. There is also an indoor bar, which is in the main dining area. The interior bar seems suited for eating a quick nibble too.  Once seated in our deluxe VIP western facing booths, our party was in heaven. The booths are incredibly high and offer the utmost privacy. You could seat three average sized adults in the booth. Additionally, a seat could be placed at each end of the table. I'd stick with three/four adults however. (Two for romance, Four for fun, Five for late night.)  Food wise? Er. Ma. Gawd.  That's pretty much it. I stuck with the Holiday Menu and ate so much it hurt (later). Yes, that's what happened. I admit it! My eyeballs were filled to the rims with what was on the plate and I ate. Four courses later I wheeled myself out on my knee scooter. A much happier, fuller, person.  I highly recommend trying the Lobster Bisque soup. Not only for the exquisite presentation, the lobster was beautifully laid at the bottom of the plate prior to the bisque being poured, but for the richness of what my palate discovered. YUM! (Ate it all.)  The Bib & Point Reyes Blue Salad, with walnuts, pears, pancetta and dried cranberries was an enormous presentation. Light as air dressing included blue cheese (that was a surprise!). (Ate it all.)  By the time my main entree arrived I was stuffed. But, have no fear, I welcomed Mediterranean Bass like there was no tomorrow. When something is stuffed with crab meat and the hollandaise is so light, well, you make do. (Ate it all.)  Dessert was a blur. Eggnog was involved. (Ate it all.)  Our seats afforded the most wonderful views of Phoenix I've had to date. The food was amazing. Exploring the outdoor patio was fun. I can't wait to come back to enjoy drinks another time!  Four Stars: Only per a hiccup noted with the downstairs check-in. I've reached out to the restaurant.   This place is stellar!  Updated: Oops! Forgot to mention our bomb diggity server Nicole S. She reached out to me. She's super chipper and really knows the menu well! You'll love her too!",

I went to many nice restaurant and I was never asked this question. It was very disappointing and made me very uncomfortable going to this place. This is big NoNo. We went there anyway. It is located in talking stick resort and U have to go through the casino to get to the elevator to restaurant. It is in 15th floor and as u walk out u will see the host. I was not pleased with the way they greeted us(didn't look ready). The lady explained about the private rooms and booth as we were walking to our table and she again mentioned that people have to spend $100/person in order to have those rooms. Ahhhh, please Do Not mention about how much we have to spend here. Considering this is upscale restaurant, it was very disappointing. And the restaurant was pretty empty including those tables with the view.  Finally we got to our table and our server, Julio, was introduced. We ordered the NY stip, skirt beef, shrimp and scallop, buffalo soup, etc... I have to say everything was really good. The buffalo soup was superb and the beet salad was very fresh. The skirt steak was little bit salty but perfectly cooked. The NY strip was also very good and goes well with the wine sauce. The shrimp and scallop wrapped with the bacon was very tasty. Julio provided us delicious dessert and he was very great. The views were not that impressive but better than nothing.  Will I be back? Maybe...they seriously need to get rid of those rules and stop telling us how much we need to spend. This is why i am giving them 3 stars despite of delicious food and our great server.",

Portion sizes are toddler sized. Steak tenderloin the size of a large scallop with a halved beet next to it no bigger than a hush puppy on a huge plate. They are trying to be haute cuisine with artistic plating...but then you have to actually eat it. BLAH! Sent back pork tenderloin TWICE. Asked for my pork to be well done. First time the pork was served rare and the little food around it was lukewarm and appetizer sized portions. The polenta was bland, but it usually is anywhere..then came the greens. OMG! I have never spit out food into my hand in a public restaurant in my life! So bitter with an overwhelmingly vinegar taste (window cleaner maybe? ) Plus side: scotch on the rocks was good and so is the view. Staff was helpful if they were older...the younger ones are clueless and tactless, beginning with the young man at the podium when I first walked in. His first words to me were \"Do you want to have dinner at the bar?\" Not a gracious greeting befitting a higher end experience. Short order cooks with chef's jackets, dressed up staff with little grace or True service knowledge. The Biltmore is worth the cost of the bill but Talking Stick is still a casino with discount store clientele and cigarette smoke. Lesson learned.",

You have to spend $200 [believe me, you will!] to sit at a private booth on the west side and enjoy the magnificent sunset, but they fail to tell you that you will also be looking over the parking lot! We were on the other  side and enjoyed the sunset orange hues, but looked over the beautiful lakes and water features. We were there for the IBM Magic Convention and enjoyed a delightfully magical wine for Walla Walla... a red blend called ''Sleight of Hand'', cleverly that was the label.

A number of menu choices were not of the traditional flair. No pasta, veal and only one chicken entree. The views are breathtaking at sunset. I know why they call it the orange sky restaurant, the setting sun casted an orange color across the western sky. The decor is very modern. There is a sky deck for viewing and dinning. The only reason I gave the restaurant a 4 was due to menu pricing. I had a Caesar salad that would be a side salad anywhere else that cost $12. The sides for dinner were expensively well over $10 for mashed potatoes. I do want to stress this is a $$$$ rating for price and the food was excellent. I will return.",

We were seated next to a very large party, which at first I didn't mind.  Our waiter arrived instantly to take our drink order, so we asked if he could give us a couple minutes to look over the drink menu.   It was clear that the large party was taking a lot of his attention, so he wasn't able to make it back to take our drink order for another 10 minutes.  After we were served our drinks, it took another 15 minutes for him to return to take our dinner order.  My mother and I ordered the bacon-wrapped branzini, my husband ordered the scallops, and my sister order the pork loin.  We ordered three sides, since everything is completely a la carte.  The branzini is served as a whole fish with the head removed wrapped in multiple pieces of bacon.  The bacon was fine, but the fish was completely tasteless otherwise.  I ate about half of mine and my mother barely touched hers.  My husband received thee medium-size scallops, sitting forlornly on a large plate.  He was terribly disappointed in the sparse serving, given the size of the scallops.  My sister was pleased with her pork loin, which she said was tender and moist.  The Brussels sprouts side was by far the best.  The baby carrots were pale, tasteless and overcooked, and the cauliflower side was also tasteless.  Throughout the entire dinner, the large group at the table next to us became louder and louder.  They were clearly having a great time and ordering a LOT of cocktails, which distracted the wait staff from other patrons.  Despite the fact that it was my mother's birthday, we opted to leave without ordering dessert, given the noise level next to us and the rather underwhelming entrees.  Our bill was $260 without a tip, so we paid to have a much finer dining experience than we actually did.  My husband mentioned something to the host on the way out, who offered to let him fill out a complaint form.  Given that my mother was tired and it was getting very late, we opted not to do so.    I'm particularly disappointed in the evening, since we've been to Orange Sky several times in the past, including hosting my husband's birthday party in a private dining room.  The quality of the food was far below what I remember.  In the future, if we want an elegant dining experience with top-notch seafood and exceptional service, we'll stick with one of our favorite choices, the Salt Cellar in Tempe.  For the same price we paid last night, we would have had an outstanding meal in a lovely setting.    I'm confident that we won't be dining at Orange Sky again at any point in the future.",

I think it's probably because I am used to eating scallops a different way.  We we ordered sides for the entire party. My favorite were the smash potatoes; the asparagus were good as well. I do plan to go back and order salmon instead. I'm not much of a steak person. The birthday dessert was delicious. The restaurant itself it's very veryyy beautiful our reservation was at 8:00pm so we had a roof of stars at the patio. Even from inside we had beautiful views. It's definitely a place I recommend. I rate it a 4 stars due to the cleanness, friendliness, stunning views, great drinks, great sides, my sister loved the scallops, and I didn't.  I plan to give it another chance and give it the last star it deserves.",

I wish I got the waitresses name because she made me feel better that we would be taken care of and our guests. You could tell they were really trying hard to fix everything on their end to leave the night on a good note . The bartender gave us a good experience as well. In fact, he is the one that ran down the stairs to see why the ceremony wasn't beginning.( Door was locked. Edward called and reminded them about bride using this entrance two days prior and we talked to the spa manager face to face and she was more than happy to help us. I believe this was the breaking point for myself ) The lack of preparation, customer service,support and overall experience falls on the lack of leadership that was displayed with management staff and hotel staff. Let me begin by saying we chose this as our wedding site because of the food, balcony that really served as a real intimate location and we overall loved this restaurant. We also liked the idea our guests could go to the club or gamble afterwards. Seemed perfect. In fact Edward and I thought this would be so much easier and less stressful to have at this location.We were wrong . They blamed management changes . If professionalism was displayed this would not of  been an issue for clients paying thousands of dollars to use your restaurant . First we had Felicia. Who was amazing promised us a lot made it seem like we picked the right place to spend our money. We talked about photography ( she said no problem to use grounds and restaurant we just need security clearance. Wrong . Fast forward to two years later a week before the wedding. Kandiss tells us no and huge miscommunication. I expressed that I would of not spent 5000 on a private Photographer and would of gone another route if you guys gave us different information. ) We also discussed about personalizing the menus to make it more personal and between all three Felicia Christina and Candiss they seemed on board. Didn't happen in fact they had the wrong soup on the menu and I quote from a waiter, \" I do apologize but we ran out of time\". They ran out of time? We have been planning this for a very long time ! Let me remind everyone thousands of dollars and this is our wedding. Our communication was ignored and the day of our event was ridiculous and stressful . Even my photographer, who does a lot of high end weddings and photo shoots was in disbelief with the lack of professionalism with hotel staff and Orange Sky management with our event. ( I could go on and on about the lack of communication prior and day of . Let's just say the happiest day of our lives was overshadowed by a lot of UNNEEDED stress. Our guests even took notice. We could share so much more that happened but I think if your reading this review you understand how our event turned out . Little things matter when you plan an event and we had our fill of apologies last Saturday.",

I decided to get us a private booth this time, which has a $120 minimum spend, but most likely you'll end up doing that anyway. We starting out with the nosh board which was an assortment of meats, dates, and cheeses. She had the chicken, I had the sirloin steak and we both got the mashed potatoes. The chicken was savory and practically melts in your mouth. As for the steak, I've had a ton of steaks in my life but this was by far the best, I mean, it was so tender that I was literally able to cut the steak with a fork! The green chili mashed potatoes were off the hook, great flavor and a huge portion.   The service here is amazing. Our waitress was super friendly, and what I liked best is that she never over talked and almost floated in every time she stopped by to refill our champagne. Quickly in and then back out, so we never broke our conversation. After dinner we went to the patio and enjoyed a view of the city with the comfort of some heaters and even a fireplace.   I will be sure to revisit this place for any special occasion!!",

Both are bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.    Atmosphere: This place is really built for romance!  Make reservations for a bench booth to watch the sunset!  Four or five months out of the year the outdoor seating would be very nice.  In July not so nice.  LOL.  It was 100+ degrees at sunset when we were there.  Service:  It was awesome.  Cannot say enough about the wait staff! There recommendations spot on!  They over heard us talking about his graduating from the sixth grade and brought him a desert consisting of mousse, cheesecake, and more.  Oh yeah... Congratulations spelled out in a chocolate sauce and a lit candle.  Thanks guys!!  Food:   My son and I decided to try something we have never had and something we knew we would like so we could share the two plates.  I ordered the halibut and he ordered the elk.   The elk was new for us... and so good that my son didn't really want to share.  I did get to taste it and I agree with him, the elk was that good.  I wouldn't want to share either.   I was probably okay with it because I had the best halibut I have ever had.  I really didn't want to share the halibut either.  We both loved the food!",

The tenderloin and salmon are big favorites and you can't go wrong with any of the sides.  Additionally, we enjoy the atmosphere.  The restaurant is lovely and the views are great.  There are many options spanning private dining areas, main dining areas, patios, etc.  The patios do have heaters as well.  The place to go for great sunset views!    We like Orange Sky so much we selected it for our company holiday party.  It was outstanding.  Again, the food was great - even for large parties.  We worked with Cameo Wall and she was fantastic.  She was on top of everything and a real pleasure to work with.  The entire staff was great and very attentive.  I would highly recommend Orange Sky for both individual dining as well as corporate events.",

Our server was fantastic and all the staff was very attentive to us throughout the evening.  The chairs were a little beat up looking but I could never decide if that was intentional or not. I will also know better and ask for a private booth. The food was underwhelming at best. We started with the Artisanal Cheeses which was pleasant and what I would consider standard fare. My wife ordered the salmon with the crab on the side, and I chose the Wagyu striploin. For our sides we had the asparagus, and the Crushed potatoes which were both very good. My wife's salmon was cooked well and was very pretty. From a taste stand point it was Ok but nothing to write home about. The crab was well cooked and tasted great. The steak was such a disappointment. When you see Wagyu you expect a certain quality and experience. The steak was cooked very unevenly, there was a fairly significant chunk of fat or gristle that I was forced to spit out, and the flavor just didn't live up to the hype. Maybe I built the steak up too much in my mind which led to my disappointment but it was definitely not what I was expecting.  In closing, good views, good environment, great service, ok food. The experience fell short for us.",

There is a dress code warning including no flip flops, t-shirts, shorts or cut offs which helps to keep the casino riff raff out.  There are glass widows lining the restaurant  with tables and booths placed all around them. The mountain and desert views are spectacular and the overall ambiance is classy and captivating.   The food was excellent although a bit overpriced. I had the tenderloin flatbread , the steak was tender and juicy and had the perfect amount of rosemary. The Tuscan kale salad and the fried green tomatoes were also delicious choices prepared with care. I agree with another reviewer who said the wine list pricing was all over the place, luckily the selection made up for the scattered pricing. The bartender we had was personable and friendly and made our visit quite enjoyable.  Overall I don't think I would make dinner reservations here, but it is a nice place to grab an app and a glass of wine and take in the stunning views of our beautiful desert city.",

We also inquired about the booth for fancy romantic dinners and they said the minimum to spend is $200. I believe I read somewhere on here it was $120 but they have obviously changed that!

However, during our 2 hour dinner the restaurant had several open seats and it was obvious they were not at full capacity. The dinning room had several open tables.   Our 5th guest showed up after we were seated and had ordered and boy did they all of a sudden accommodate us.  The frustrating thing is why couldn't they have just added a small table to our table in the very beginning ?   They were not fully committed and they lied to us.   Other than being hard to do business with the food and atmosphere was incredible. They need to work on their flexibility and be more attentive to their customers.  For the price you pay to dine there they sure make it hard to do business with them..",

One thing you should know, even if you have a 5 pm reservation, they do not open the doors to the elevator until 5 pm on the dot. The view from the private booth wasn't as great as I expected, as this side of the building overlooks at an empty dirt lot. The other side of the building has a better view. However, when I visited the main dinning area, I was really glad we booked the private dinning booth. Our experience was peaceful, relaxing, intimate, with great service. The main dinning area was louder, with a lot more going on. We order some cocktails and a bottle of wine. I got the limoncello cocktail, which was just what I was in the mood for (crisp, balanced, refreshing!). For entrees, we all ordered different steaks, and we were all happy with them! Our servicer went out of his way to make sure he truly understood how I wanted my New York Strip cooked. And when it arrived, it was cooked perfectly! For our accompaniments, we ordered the crushed potatoes, whipped potatoes, and brussel sprouts, which were on special for the night. I couldn't pick a favorite out of the three! Our server nicely brought out a little dessert for our celebration at the end of the night!",

We were ten minutes late but welcomed with smiles and seated immediately. Our water, wine and cocktails were served within minutes and the appetizers followed soon after.

Demitrio's wine recommendation was excellent and paired so well with our steak and crab.

    "text": "I would like to say the friendly service, sparkling ambiance, extensive wine menu are all excellent. Sean was our server and we reserved a table to enjoy drinks while viewing the beautiful sunset. Sean had a detailed knowledge of the menu, especially the wines, and even about the hotel's background. He made a great first impression (this was our first visit here) as did the beautiful sunset and kind staff. After learning that we had our parents' wedding anniversary to celebrate as well as mine and my husband's he specially brought out a luscious chocolate crunch cake for both couples to enjoy. As we exited the restaurant there was a man singing and playing the piano for live entertainment, I would have loved to experience the bar area for a fun atmosphere to enjoy the view and drinks. All of the views from the restaurant were magnificent. The entire experience was spectacular and I would love to come back. I did notice the menu had very limited vegetarian options and maybe a phone call to check on those options would be helpful for those looking for veggie dishes.",

    "text": "Spectacular from start to finish.  My husband and I booked a stay here to celebrate my coming home after 7 months away on a military assignment as a little 'stay-cation.' Upon arrival we're guided to our gorgeous executive king room with a spectacular view. After settling in we of course head downstairs for a bit of gaming (it is a casino resort after all). We were a little disappointed to find out the hard way that their on-floor drinking policy doesn't mirror that of Vegas where if you're playing you drink for free. We paid approximately $18 for two drinks while playing, nevertheless, the cocktails were well-made and delivered with a smile.   After losing several games we decided to head upstairs to Orange Sky restaurant. As we were a little early for our reservation they shepherded us to the bar where naturally we could add some much-needed lubrication to our wait. The wine list was excellent and we selected a bottle of 2013 BenMarco Malbec. We enjoyed the bottle for about 30 minutes and took it to our table which had become available. At the table we were greeted by our server Elyssa or Elissa (SP?). Before I continue, I must say that she is the reason I chose to write a review at all. Her service was impeccable! Not only was she well-educated on the offerings, but what would potentially suit our needs best. She was funny, but not obscene, accommodating but not intrusive, and professional without being stiff, curt, or dismissive. Too often have I gone to restaurants where the recommendations by the staff are simply the most expensive. Today was not the case. Her suggestions were all spot on and indicative of what she actually enjoyed the most and it was so refreshing to discover how much I enjoyed them myself.   We started off with replacing the bottle we had brought to the table with yet another of the same (why toy with perfection). I then selected the agave-chile beef tenderloin with sweet potato, avocado, pumpkin seeds to start and my husband the crab and corn fritters with i'itoi onion tartar sauce, and squash pickles. The tenderloin was absolute perfection. Few times before have I had such an exemplary protein. Cooked to perfection, melted in the mouth, and the sauce was fantastically rustic (as if rustic can have degrees which I argue it can). My husband enjoyed the crab cakes but did seem the slightest bit envious of my selection which is a rare occurrence to be sure.   For our entrees I chose the grilled elk loin with wild mushrooms, leeks, and a carrot-ancho sauce. He selected the twin 4-oz cuts of beef tenderloin with the added shrimp and scallop steaks option. He chose the yellow tomato horseradish cream which he enjoyed quite a lot and while mine came with the carrot-ancho sauce, I also asked for a side of the garlic-chile hollandaise. I was going to order the wild boar but was advised against it in favor of the elk which I'm thankful for considering the reviews on here of the boar and that they align with her conclusions. Too game-y, dry, and somewhat disappointing while the elk was anything but! Truly a delight, and he loved the beef! There was no part of the meal I didn't enjoy and just as we were ready for the bill, out came several complimentary desserts! A wonderful chocolate hazelnut ganache with a dark chocolate mousse quinelle and both chocolate and vanilla ice creams all because my husband had casually mentioned I was in the mood for some ice cream! This exemplifies service beyond what would ordinarily be called for or expected.   In summary, to dine here one cannot go wrong. Ask for Elissa, order nearly anything except the boar, and be prepared to be wowed! The cost was reasonable in relation to the experience and without question...we will return to enjoy the soon-to-be released winter menu!",

    "text": "My fiance and I ate here last weekend for his birthday, and we are so very glad we stopped by to give them a try!  The walk alone to the restaurant is very cool! First you walk through the casino into a glass enclosed room with 2 elevators and a desk in front of them. There will be someone there to guide you to which floor you need to go to, and it just kind of adds to the experience. Once you go up the elevators there is another large open room with many windows in which you can see the whole city from. Very cool. The ladies at the front desk will confirm your reservation and will walk you through another room with a piano, couches, a very stylish bar, and a glass enclosure full of bottles of various types of wines and champagnes. A gentleman will then lift a velvet red rope for you to pass through as you walk to your table.   The actual restaurant is gorgeous - it has the most beautiful finishes all over, small details, large floor to ceiling windows with a view of the city, a romantic fireplace, and an amazing outdoor patio with comfortable seating and an infinity pool.  All this and we haven't even discussed the food!!!! The food is prepared with so much care there and you can tell the chefs are very mindful of their work. The service is top notch. We started with some drinks; I ordered some sort of tequila-based drink off of their cocktail menu and it was flavorful and delicious. My date ordered a drink similar to an old fashioned and while it was sweet, it was still very good.   We drank out on the patio until our crab cake appetizer was ready (our server came out and let us know). The crab cake was very good, but nothing to rave about. The salads however were a very unexpected amazing surprise! I had an arugula salad with berries and pomegranate seeds and some sort of citrus dressing and it blew my mind. My fiance ordered a Cesar and it was so light and delicious.   For the main course, I ordered the scallops which were so delicate and savory that I have been craving them this past week! He ordered the lamb and he said it was the best he has ever had. We shared the chili potatoes which were so delicious.   The waiter brought out a small piece of cake and fruit for dessert, on the house because it was a special birthday dinner. I was skeptical of the cake because most cakes at restaurants taste about the same, but this was truly the best chocolate cake I have ever had. it was rich and creamy and the mousse was to die for. Even though it was very small, it was more than enough and was the perfect end to our experience at Orange Sky.   I definitely recommend trying this place out for any special occasion, romantic dinner, or adult celebration. Make sure you make a reservation and try to come at sunset if possible. You will not be disappointed!!!!",

This restaurant provides great views, impeccable service and outstanding food. As I go out to eat more and more I start to look at the overall ambience - noise level, space between tables, promptness of being seated, lighting - especially when you are paying a certain price. This place provided a seamless experience from start to finish. Now for the food:  a wonderful chilled beet and blackberry salad with honeyed goat cheese, decadently cheesy cauliflower gratin, plump and juicy diver scallops, buttery steak that didn't need a steak knife- and let's not leave out dessert - gorgeous flourless chocolate cake with bruleed banana. Oh, and I didn't mention they serve house made bread and lavash first thing. I have the utmost respect for restaurants that still serve bread!

What we weren't told was that the service was second rate out there...had to continually track down our waiter  Thomas and at one point had to actually walk inside and tell him how tired I was of having to keep trying to track him down.  He had no personality, we had to ask for our appetizer, salad and dinner plates to be removed. Had to ask twice to have our heater turned on. Our salads were placed in front of the wrong people. Asparagus came to the table cold. Long wait for an antipasto appetizer. As far as the bar goes we had to ask for napkins for our cocktails and the outfits of the staff were disheveled and not the caliber of \"fine dining\" hype we expected.  We are local residents and I have never left a review but was so incredibly disappointed I had to let others know. Heading out...our party( who arealso discussed how typically you see managers walking around in fine dining restaurants askin patrons how their dinner is and no one came out to check on us at all.

They even accommodated our quirky requests for bar drinks, letting us take over the reception area and patio, etc.  The only thing that could have possibly been improved was the price (it was a bit high but not unexpectedly so) and some wine recommendations (they have a great wine list, but no sommelier).  There are some adorable tables on the side of the restaurant surrounded by sheer curtains so you can have a view and privacy, I can't wait to go back and eat at one of those tables.

She appeared to be sorry and actually trying to listen - but who knows? I told her \"this is the worst food I've had - since living in Phoenix\" and \" I would not recommend it to anyone\".  She just nodded her head - with her hands together and walked away.  At least they did take the OS Salad - or as I called it - the OC Salad (Oil Change Salad) and the lobster my dinner partner ordered - which we both called \"Rubber Chicken Lobster\". The waitstaff were very attentive - that's why I'll give the place one star. I'll be dining at Cholla's instead - inside the Casino Arizona on McKellips.",

    "text": "TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! My husband and I dined here last night (a Tuesday) with his mom for a late Valentine's Day dinner and it was really disappointing. I am not joking when I say that we saw our server twice during our entire meal. I ordered a glass of wine from her when she came around the first time (after about 10 minutes of waiting for anyone to appear) and 20 minutes later there was no sign of my wine or of her.  I eventually had to flag down a bus boy to get it. The waitress came by the next time after the bus boy dropped off my wine and she realized that she had forgotten all about it. At this time she took both our salad and our dinner orders because we had been sitting and waiting for so long that we had plenty of time to decide on what we were going to order. This was the last time that we saw her the rest of the night. No one came by to refill our rolls. My salad had almost zero dressing on it and I had to eat it that way because no one came around to check on us at all. Our food took forever to come out of the kitchen and was delivered by the bus boy when it finally did. We wanted to order dessert and again had to flag someone down to get any type of service. After another 10 minutes the bus boy came out with the dessert tray and we were so frustrated that we declined and told him to let our server know that we just wanted the check.  Our server never appeared. A bus boy dropped the check to us and that was that. We tipped a measly 15% (which would have probably been closer to 0% had I not waited tables myself for 10 years in the past) and left. We will never go back which is a shame because the actual entrees were very good. The wine list is hugely over priced and so ridiculous for the wines that are offered. At that price point you expect impeccable food, wine selection, and service and that is just not what is being offered here.  Skip it and go to City Hall.",

Service was good, though no one could figure out who was to serve our water for the first 15 minutes we were there.  The food (lobster bisque, king crab, and steak) also tasted good, but within about 4 hours, my wife and I both became violently ill.  I reported this the next day to the hostess, who seemed completely unconcerned.  So, we also reported it directly to management, mostly so they could investigate and possibly prevent others from having the same experience.  Management, however, was also not interested in how food poisoning occurred in its restaurant.  For the price tag you pay to eat here, I'd recommend someplace else.  Most restaurants of this caliber put food safety very high on their priorities list.  Not so at Orange Sky.  (We also were there to celebrate a special occasion.  The restaurant was not half full.  Where did they put us???  Next to the restroom.)",

They sat us outside where i had asked to be seated when i had made mt reservation, and then Julio arrived at the table. We immediately knew that our evening would be enjoyable. My brother, who was visiting from out of town, asked Julio about almost every item on the menu, and Julio was perfect at explaining all the items. As for the food...it was delicious! The rib eye and sirloin were cooked and seasoned perfectly, As was the swordfish. The accompaniment's we ordered, Brentwood corn and sweet potatoes with goat cheese were amazing! All the waiters that we had at the table were great, but hats off to Julio for making the evening that much more special.  We'll be visiting again for sure, but maybe next time I'll reserve a private dining booth for me and my girlfriend. Either way inside or outside you can't loose.",

I had a nice refreshing glass of moscato and my husband had kettle and sodas. He ordered the scallops and kale and I had the NY strip steak and crushed potatoes. It was all delicious. The potatoes had a little too much vinegar for me. What we didn't realize was that when we initially sat down and were offered water, was that we were charged for that water. We should have just said no water, or tap water. So instead of a 2nd glass of wine and dessert, I filled up on water... We also thought it was odd that they took our IDs for like 5 minutes. IDK maybe its an AZ thing?",

From my experience this is probably a three star restaurant. For entrees, we ordered steaks and one person ordered scallops with shrimp which  he said was excellent. I had the New York strip which I would say was average. I have had better steaks for less money. One person said the tenderloin was very good. Perhaps the most disappointing part of the meal were the side's. They are served sort of family style with portions for two people. We ordered potatoes, Brentwood corn, and asparagus. They all were good but I can say the portions were fairly light. For dessert we had the cheesecake and the raspberries with cake. I think they both were good. Our total bill including tip for three was over $200.",

It was a welcome to AZ dinner for my parents so I called ahead and ask for a nice table I was booked into a private booth looking out over the valley.  Amazing views and was very nice.  Although after exploring the rest of the restaurant a normal table in the main dinning room by the window would have been just as special for a family dinner.  If you are looking for a special occasion restaurant for you and someone special the private booths would make a really special experience (~$150 min FYI).  I would highly recommend for anniversary dinners etc.    Service is what you would expect for a restaurant of this level, several people worked the table and were very professional.  One thing I would say negative was I asked for a recommendation between two wines, the server preceded to ask me my price range and then recommended a wine $40 more then the range and then could not even find it on the menu.  Made for an awkward situation but other then that service was great.    Food was really good, although they are known for their steaks we all ended up getting seafood which was all very good.  Salmon was some of the best I have had.  The Crushed potatoes and Carrots were the sides we ordered and they were both good.  The desert was amazing it was some chocolate and berry creation don't remember the name.    All and all it was a great experience and I will be back for sure.",

We were told there was no table yet, but would grab us when it was ready.  About 7:40 came around and we had not been set yet. The hostess comes over and has to continually ask us our party name and what we are waiting on. I told her 3 times our name and our reservation time. We finally are sat down and are promptly poured glasses of water. Then we sit for over 15 minutes before we are approached by a waitress who was not ours to ask if we had been helped yet. We had not even ordered a drink yet... At this point I was thoroughly dissapointed and we have yet to even order our food. When the waitress came to finally take our order, we order our drinks then them she has to take our IDs to the computer to scan them for 5 minutes to make sure we are of age...she tells us it's easier then doing the math. We then go to order, she asked us if we were ready and then tells us \"even though you are ready I will help you with the menu\" as if we were 10 years old and have never been out to eat at a restaurant. She then goes to question my wife about how her steak is being cooked....is this really a fine dining? I've been all over the US and world eating at highly rated restaurants and this was one of the worst experiences I have had. I would have had better service at IHOP. Thankfully the food was spot on! And my steak was cooked perfectly.",

    "text": "I love the atmosphere.  I love the view.  I love the modern decor.  I love the openness of the place.  I could probably spend all day and night here in one of their comfy chairs drinking martinis.  However, when it comes to the food and service my 'love' of this place is downgraded to 'eh.  I went here with my wife and a few friends before seeing a comedy show (Jim Gaffigan) downstairs.  We had a reservation which really wasn't needed because the place was pretty dead.  We were seated promptly and our waitress was pleasant.  We had about 2 hours before our show was to start which we figured would be plenty of time for a cocktail and dinner.  For being so dead this place was somehow very slow with just about everything except with our entrees which came out before we were done with our salads/appetizers.  The waitress awkwardly turned around to put our steaks back in the kitchen for 5 more minutes which ultimately screwed them up.    Here is my rundown on the food:  * Bread = nothing special but comes in handy because you will wait forever for your food.  * Roman Caesar Salad = worst Caesar type salad I've ever had.  It had hardly any flavor due to not enough dressing, sub-par quality lettuce, and an overall weird mix of ingredients.  * Burrata and Prosciutto Pesto = not bad but somebody took it away without asking if we were through with it yet.  * Kobe Flat Iron Steak = very good and very flavorful  * Ribeye = just ok for a $40 steak.  Nowhere near the flavor or quality of some other high-end steak places in the area.  * Garlic Steak Fries = wtf?  They are HUGE (think a potato cut into 4 pieces) and lacked any kind of garlic flavor.  Needed ketchup or aioli badly.  * Brussels Sprouts = excellent!  * Garlic Herb Butter \"Sauce\" = wasn't a sauce at all.  It was clearly hard butter.  I think they forgot to microwave it.  This place is definitely worth a visit to sit, sight see, and have a drink.  If its top notch service and steak you are looking for try Dominick's or Mastro's.  I'm glad I went here but I won't be back for dinner.",

It doesn't take a special occasion or an event for me to splurge or treat my lady to a nice dinner.  If I'm going to drop 200 to 300 for a nice dinner, the food and service should be excellent.  My lady and I requested a table with a view, the view was nothing special, it was looking out towards topgolf and the 101.  The food quality was very average.  My steak was no better than a Keg Steakhouse or even a Longhorn's for that matter.  I wasn't pleased with our sides either.  All and all not a memorable experience and very mediocre food and service.

We were hoping to have a nice, romantic dinner. We don't get out for date nights much since we have two little kids at home.  I understand that not all requests can be accommodated, but I asked to be notified, in advance, if they couldn't make this happen.  No one called or emailed.   Got to the restaurant and they seated us at a center table, far, far away from the window, in the noisy main dining room. Said that not only were the private booths taken, but the window tables in the main dining room were taken as well.  Made the reservation 3 weeks in advance, and then saw three tables empty while we were there! And one of the filled tables was a family with two little kids. They clearly made no effort to honor a special request on a special occasion.   Our waiter was very kind, so we ordered champagne and an appetizer. But we went somewhere else for dinner. I doubt we'll be back. Restaurant gets two stars only because of our waiter who was thoughtful, prompt and friendly, and did his best to make our experience pleasant despite our palpable disappointment.",

Because it was my birthday, they seated us in on of the private booths, even though he had not requested it.  That was definitely a nice touch, as we were able to watch the end of the sunset from the comfort of our private table.  Our food was delicious.  We had soup that was fantastic, although I don't remember what kind because this was a couple of months ago.  Then, for our entrees we shared the crab legs and some sort of steak.  The steak was good, but the crab was INCREDIBLE!  It was already shelled, so we didn't have to go to any trouble and were just able to enjoy it.  Then, they brought us a free dessert for my birthday, but I'm not really a dessert person, so I don't remember what it was.   ** One tiny little complaint-- a few months earlier my bf and I had been at the casino and just wanted to go up and look at the view.  They would not allow us to go up because my bf was wearing flip-flops.  I think that's kind of ridiculous in AZ, but, oh well, just be sure to dress to impress when you go there.",

We ordered our entrees and after over an hour of waiting, were told by the manager our server was new. Maybe you should have better training!!! They offered to bring our food & comp our meal, but we were finished. We paid for our cheese board & left. What a disappointment, especially after my husband planned a nice evening out!",

    "text": "We really enjoyed our 11 year anniversary dinner.  However I wish we could have gotten the private (high back) seating so we could have gotten the sunset view directly.  We walked by the high back seating and noticed some of them were empty the whole time we were there.  The food was delicious!  We ordered and shared the Small Beef Tenderloin and Chilean Sea Bass.  The Tenderloin was cooked perfectly and the Sea Bass melted in your mouth like butter, both perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious!  We also each had a scallop and steak, but it was too salty and perhaps too much food by the time we ate the steak and fish with a side dish of crushed potatoes (recommend this one too!).  Our server did a fantastic job separating our dishes into two for us and she gave us a very yummy chocolate cookie dessert that was beautifully displayed!  Our view from our table was disappointing, although we were looking directly at the fireplace, the 5 Neon Exit signs were very distracting and took away from the romance.  But we walked outside, enjoyed the view and very impressed with the heaters.  We're planning on taking his parents here when they come into town in March.  We'll make sure we can get the window seating to watch the sunset!",

    "text": "Upon our arrival there was lots of confusement regarding our reservation & seating. Once we were, it was a lovely table where we were to celebrate a mildstone Birthday. After 10 minutes a group of a least 30-40 men were standing across from being very loud where we could not hear ourselves speak. We did speak to a waitier & they were then seated across from us in the bar area. It became apparent that this was going to continue all night & right before our dinner was to be served we had to speak to a manger to be moved to a quiet table. We felt as though we were at a spots bart instead of a special occasion rest.   The service was not great & he was pushing drinks more then anything. The rolls were terrible.  He recomended a white wine & to my surprise when the bill came it was $17.00  which was ridiculous. To top it off the waiter at the end of the evening brings out a desert with a candle & lights it when 2 of our guests were not at the table & he wanted to blow out the candle & leave it with his lighter.  What an insulting evening & had to pay big dollars for an evening that deserves 2 stars for the view.  We shall not be back.",

At least that's what I thought.  The second we got to the restaurant it seemed like we were bothering the people who were supposed to sit us at our table.  The huge dining room was half empty with no ambience and our waitress was not exactly \"warm and fuzzy\".  We ordered drinks and dinner at the same time and they both came to the table at about the same time meaning the food was not exactly made to order.  The food tasted okay at best.  We were at dinner for less than an hour with a bad waitress, okay food, and a drink each which all cost about $120.  Money we don't mind spending if it's worth it.  We gave the waitress the smallest tip I have ever given anyone.  I'm not sure she noticed or even cared.  Both of us were so upset that we went straight home.  My girlfriend looked stunning and thats the only good thing I will remember from my trip to Orange Sky.",

    "text": "Our thoughts about Orange Sky mirrors many of the other comments here.  The bad offsets the good.  We arrived for a reservation timed to watch the sun set.  As others have noted we had to walk through a smoke-filled Casino to get to the private elevator up to the restaurant.  I'm not sure if there is another way in, but we asked several outside staff where we should park for the restaurant and followed their directions.   Once inside the casino from the west parking area, we followed the signs on the ceiling signs to get us into the general area, although not all signs along our path indicated the way.  We had to look around until we found other signs that brought us to the private elevators.  There's a young lady there who we assume is the doorman preventing the general population from getting up to the restaurant as looky-loos, which we appreciated.  What we didn't really like was the dress code.  Not that there was a dress code, but why bother if it only excludes the most basic t-shirts, flip-flops, and baggy pants.  We were dressed up for our special occasion, but most of the other patrons to this high-end restaurant were dressed like they were going out to shop at Walmart.  Not really the experience we were expecting.  We would have liked the code to rather tell you the minimum standards of dress.  The ambiance at the restaurant is simply spectacular, less of course the view of the parking lot.  We didn't find it as distracting as some others, but the point is noted.  That being said, the sunset was amazing and when it got dark the lights on the 101, the Pavilion, and the houses on Camelback were just beautiful.  The open floor plan is very appealing also.  Many people talked about their private booths on the way into the main seating area, but we like to see all the action.  The service was OK, but we've had much better at places like Remington's and Casa Mia.  While the staff pays attention, the interaction is just not at the level of professionalism you'd expect at a high-end place.  The exception was the Sommelier, Lukas, who knows his stuff and added a lot of class to the experience.  Another issue we found was the waiter stations located in-between every other table against the windows.  We were uncomfortable having conversations with the staff standing right behind our chair and their constant movement around us distracted from our experience.  Why in the world are there wait stations on the floor in-between tables?    Food presentation was mixed.  We started with the Antipasti plate.  It was a work of art, laid out wonderfully with flatbread accents on a wooden platter.  What ruined the whole thing was the metal sauce cup, which held the delicious fig compote. These are the same ones you get at a diner to hold Ketchup.   Why they wouldn't put it in a white ceramic bowl I don't know, but that little change would really step it up instead of having the cheap metal cup drag it down.  Attention to detail if you're a 4 star restaurant.  Our steaks came on a giant white plate with the steak and a small pepper as a garnish.  Food presentation can't be stressed enough.   We stared at our plates and found it to be of limited appeal.  While the steaks were outstanding, they didn't look very appealing all alone on the big white canvass.  Yes, the sides are served in separate bowls and you need the room on the plate to put them, but that doesn't excuse being served a slab of meat on a giant white plate.  Pretty plain.  The steaks come with a side of sauce.  Again, the sauce came in a cheap SMALL metal cup that was placed on the table instead of a white ceramic bowl matching the plates, and placed ON the plate.  That would have helped with presentation.  The blue cheese butter was piped in the cup instead of the typical \"coins\" made by rolling the butter and cheese into a log, then cutting it into coins.  The coins are easier to place on your steak and melt much better.  The coins would have actually provided enough for the steak.   The amount that came in the cup with the steak wasn't even worth serving with a $38 steak, and an extra cup was $4.  I would rather have given the small amount back and had them knock $4 off the steak.  Wine.  This is always a touchy area and there are several schools of though.  First, Lukas's wine list is spectacular.   It has a wide range of offerings at a wide range of prices, and he has probably the best selection of Cakebread in the state.  That being said, I found the prices all over the place.  Some were priced at 100% markup, some at 200% and some even higher.   I don't mind paying 100% as this is probably the maximum \"fair\" price in my view.  That's my school of thought.  Other's, including Orange Sky, may think they can charge more because of the view out the windows. That's their prerogative, and maybe they have the clientele that doesn't mind paying these markups.   Maestro's does this and that's their niche, but Maestros is head and shoulders above Orange Sky in",

    "text": "First off- this place has an amazing view. Set upon the 15th floor of the Talking Stick Casino- make sure and make reservations for sunset, as obviously this is what it is named for.  They have private seating areas that are secluded and could be a very romantic setting- although we didn't sit at one of these booths because we had a large table.  I suggest making a reservation if you'd like to eat here. Also, make sure and go into the actual restaurant and not just the bar area- it is separated.    Service: On point!  The waiters came full of recommendations and were very attentive .   Food:  Amazing!  Simple, yet elegant menu, reasonable portion sizes (large enough to split), and great presentation.   I had the seasonal oysters (very clean- served with cocktail sauce and fresh grated horseraddish root), twin fillets (enough for 2), truffle baked potato (very rich and plenty to share with 2-4), carrots (everyone always forgets about this veggie- they did it up right), mushroom risotto (decadent) .    Drinks: Large wine menu but glass prices were a little high.    Atmosphere: They had a great piano player and singer in the bar/lounge area when you walked in.  They also had several patio areas which we did not visit because it was quite chilly out.   *One complaint- I came to the bar side first before our reservations and ordered a glass of wine that was $13/glass.  When I got my tab it was $17.50, and did not include gratuity. I did not want to complain, but it was a little strange.  Same thing happened to the two girls next to me.  Still not sure what this *upcharge* was for.",

We ordered drinks and appetizers. Our waitress was FANTASTIC. As our waitress went to get our appetizers, the hostess came to get us for our table in the restaurant. When we asked whether we needed to close our tab out at the lounge, the hostess told us, \"No worries, we'll transfer it to your table\" Nope, our lounge waitress came over in a huff to close out our tab.   We sat down at our table at 8:10PM. It was obvious that our server and the lounge waitress were arguing about our lounge tab. The restaurant really wasn't that busy. It was 8:50PM, and our server had not bothered to come take our order. The only time he hustled over was when he saw us get up to leave - WITHOUT ORDERING BECAUSE HE DIDN'T BOTHER TO COME TAKE THE ORDER.   The menu is \"meh\". Limited steak and seafood menu. Meat 'n potatoes. I expect better service for the prices they were charging.",

We went for a late night dinner at the bar area in the back, but got to see all the really cool private dining areas they have with views. It felt like Vegas!  Really amazing.  We are vegetarian and not a lot on the menu as far as dinner entrees we could eat (in fact, none) but we did a la carte sides and they were really yummy. The broccolini, caesar salad, steak fries and bread were great. I really enjoyed the modern design and sleek atmosphere. When you see all the little private dining areas (reservations needed for those I'm sure) that also have super incredible views, you will be sold. I truly forgot that I was in Arizona. I felt like we were in a big city or in Vegas. Cool place.",

Anitpasti plate with prosciutto, sopressata, ciabatta bread, olives, artichokes, and asparagus was good. Didn't touch the portobella mushrooms (GAHROSS!!), duck confit (DOUBLE GAHROSS) or the goat cheeses on the plate though... Could've done without those!   The lobster bisque tasted like someone poured it out of a can :o( but to their credit, this IS Arizona and I don't usually have bisque comparable to Seattle or San Francisco.   They made up for the bisque with the Tenderloin Tips served as requested at medium rare. Melt in your mouth good! The garlic steak fries and smoked cheddar whipped Yukon potatoes were quickly devoured! It's a jip though if you want any sauce on anything because they charge extra.   The tab was way overpriced for an Indian Casino. I mean, really. This isn't a hot spot in the middle of Vegas, Miami or Los Angeles but they priced those places out of the stratosphere. Will I go back? Probably not... unless it goes on the expense account!",

You will love dining at Orange Sky at the Talking Stick Resort.\"  She was absolutely correct!

Quite the combination.  And the food was perfectly prepared, and delicious.  Large portions and very tasty, every single item.  Recommendation:  Order less than you might think you need, or you will leave stuffed.  And then there was the sunset.  Oh, my.  God was all over that orange sky that night.  Gorgeous.

I went on Restaurant Week. Yes... it is amateur week but, I could not have been more impressed.  The GM gave us a tour of the restaurant which apparently they do not offer normally on the weekends. After walking past the live music every night there are 2 private dining rooms and 7 private dining booths. The private booths are incredible. You have your own personal window that looks over the 101 and has mountain views from 15 stories up in the sky (hence the name!). The entire restaurant is so spacious. Truly non-existent anymore. We were lucky enough to go out on the patio and spot panoramic views of the golf course and you can even see wild horses running through the dessert!!  The sommelier was Luciano. He was wonderful and didn't make us feel we should order a $100+ bottle of wine. The wine list was extensive but, we settled on Wild Horse pinot noir (it was only appropriate). Kim, our server was experience, knowledgeable and friendly. Then came the food!! My steaks were cooked perfectly and my wife is still raving about the yellow fin tuna. Dessert....Oh my God......  Negatives: Have to walk through the smoky gamblers and poor signage. Positives: The friendly staff and unparalleled atmosphere.  We really had a wonderful evening and we were thrilled to find the best kept secrete in AZ!!",

From the very first interaction with the staff at the restaurant, my experience was nothing less than stellar.  Helpful, friendly, professional and simply a delight to work with.  We hosted our dinner on the outdoor covered patio overlooking the golf course and the mountains from the 15th (top) floor of the hotel.  A very contemporary design with a huge infinity pool/fountain and glass partitions.  Padded seats at the outskirts of the pool for your viewing pleasure.  Usually open to the public, due to the size of our group and another single large party, we had the entire space privately to ourselves.  The wait staff introduced themselves to me immediately upon arriving and were as attentive as I would have hoped for without overdoing it.  We were never without drinks in hand or waiting too long for our order to be taken or food to arrive.  The food was really really good - and I know feeding a group our size can be a huge challenge.  It was as if we were the only patrons in the entire place.  Indoor seating is equally delightful and ther are even beautiful private booths that overlook the desert/mountains facing a floor to ceiling glass wall.  I would recommend this restaurant to just about anyone - especially for a romantic experience.  Well done Orange Sky and to Cameo Wall (group events coordinator)",

    "text": "Wish I could give more stars just because of the servers Kyle and Efren.  These gentleman are a class act.  We were seated at a wrong table, based on the reservations we had made.  These gentleman somehow realized this and rescued us from a bad situation.   Some of the interior tables here are sooo close to other diners, and the tables are very deep  so you cant even talk to each other, terrible design.  Once settled at our actual reserved space, these 2 gentleman  treated us like royalty. They were fun, attentive and knowledgeable. This made for  a wonderful evening for us, which would NOT have been the case without these gentleman recognizing the restaurant error and fixing it.   The food was very good, its pricey, but at least no screaming kids and jerk people on cell phones. We do not return to restaurants that allow this behavior  to impact their civilized diners when paying for expensive dining experiences.",

We came here for a team dinner and everyone was floored by the great mountain views  Stumbled upon this gem as I looked at close-by places. \"Hmm, it's on the top of a casino on a road called Talking Stick Way, let's check it out..\"  LAMB CHOPS Literally floored at the masterful lamb chops I had. The best I've ever had  A friend of mine got WAGYU and the piece I had was literally melt in your mouth umami fat protein ughhhh  Mac n cheese was great and even the kale was tasty!!!  POST- FOOD HIGH- i think they pump oxygen in here because we were all euphoric (i kid you not) after our meal  Phenomenal dining experience. Our waiter was amazing and super attentive. Orange Sky is a MUST if you're even within 50 miles. Seriously. I can't wait to take my future wife here.",

There was a blueberry currant on the meat that made the meat so sweet that's all you tasted in the dish. Also, reservation spot given to us was supposedly the best in the house at the time but we were given just a normal spot at the restaurant. Risotto was also less than mediocre. Overall: less than mediocre experience.",

    "text": "We were looking forward to dining at Orange Sky for the first time, and unfortunately we left very disappointed. Our waitress was not what you would expect at a fine dining restaurant, very casual and she made several errors. We ordered cocktails and appetizers to start: the shrimp chowder and the crab fritters. The fritters were the highlight of the meal, delicious and unique. The chowder was good, but served luke warm (bordering on cold), and definitely needed to be warmed.   We ordered our main course, drinks ran out (and it took quite a while for her to come back and inquire if we wanted anything else), and we waited for the food to come out. Two of the three steaks were not cooked properly, my husband and I ordered medium rare and it was medium well, and our friend had a steak that was not done enough. It took ten minutes to reheat it (should have been three minutes) and by the time his steak reappeared the rest of us were almost done eating. The sauces that come with the beef was also somewhat of a fiasco, they arrived at different times and our other friend waited five minutes for one to arrive while her steak sat in front of her.   It was a subpar experience, and probably explains why it was so empty on a Friday evening. The waitress did make the comment a few times (when she made a mistake or as she said \"goofed\") that she has just flown in. Our friends had been before about four years ago and had a similar experience, so this was a second chance and let's just say we will not be back.",

    "text": "Ooooooooh boy here we go.   This was a very rough night all around. I will start with the service. Our main server seemed to either be having a horrendously bad day or just genuinely did not care about his job. I am someone who tends to ask questions or for recommendations and I don't think I got an answer out of him that was more than four words and that was when I asked where the restroom is and he said \"It's over there bro\" and pointed. It felt as if we were a burden to him which is not a good feeling.   Moving on to the food. The kitchen also had a rough night.  Our starter was pretty good. It was some kind of a Bruschetta and it was very nice. No complaints there. My date had a salmon dish as an entree and when it came out it wasn't cooked evenly, one side was burned and the other side was almost raw which is kind of strange to me. My Rib-eye was requested rare and brought out well done. We let our server know that both our dishes were cooked incorrectly and he rolled his eyes and said \"Oh fine\" and snatched out plates and didn't return until they were made again. Mine came back cooked medium rare which is absolutely fine and my dates salmon was cooked much better. The server put the plates down and pretty much ran away before we could tell him if anything was wrong again.   After what can only be described as one of my most bizarre meals out I didn't feel like sticking around for dessert which is a shame because I was really wanting something sweet.   Overall. This was horrible for the kind of money that was spent. If I had gone through and booked a table at one of the windows I would have been livid.   The only reason this got two stars and not one was because the hostess at the front was exceptionally nice and apologetic. She offered to get a manger when we were leaving and I didn't want to stay around for anything more. Definitely not coming back to this.",

As far as value is concerned, there isn't much but the wine list is definitely reasonable.

We're paying over $800 for our meal and your response to our food taking forever is you don't have your chef hat on?

    "text": "My parents were celebrating their 51st wedding anniversary last week, and decided to spend it at Orange Sky, overlooking the AZ sunset.  They made a reservation a few weeks ahead of time, and on that call learned of the different seating options at the restaurant (interior, near window, on plexiglass deck, etc).  The restaurant suggested they come in to see the options in person and choose their table, and about a week prior to the anniversary dinner they made a special trip Orange Sky, chose their specific table, and were told everything was all set.    They arrived 10 minutes prior to their reservation on the night of the big anniversary dinner, only to see that their table was occupied and that those diners were still on their pre-dinner cocktails.  The restaurant then told them that their table was not available and that they could sit at one of the interior tables instead.  When my parents explained that it was their 51st anniversary and that they specifically come out the week prior in person to choose the table, the restaurant manager, Joy, told them there was nothing she could do.  She offered no solution except for them to take an interior table, and my parents were so livid they decided to leave instead.    The concierge at Talking Stick was helpful in getting them a new reservation at a different restaurant in town, and was appalled to hear what had happened at Orange Sky--it sounds like the restaurant is not run by the resort itself but by a 3rd party?   Regardless,they will never set foot in another Talking Stick Resort restaurant again.",

    "text": "I went to Orange Sky Saturday night for cocktails and a dinner party. It was my first time at this restaurant and I always like to use Yelp to read reviews and see other people's thoughts. I would say the reviews were 50-50 some people complained about the food a lot of people complained about the service.  I got to say the service was spectacular. Every person I passed even if it was one that bussed  tables, said hi with a smile. Our servers we're always prompt, could give food recommendations and understood the menu, and always checked up to see if we needed anything else. I don't know if they have been looking at the reviews and had some type a meeting with the staff to make sure that they were friendly and their service was great at all times, but whatever the case was they definitely made sure they were doing things right.  The food was awesome. I had a rare ribeye, mind you 17 ounces so I shared it with someone and it was cooked to perfection. I also had the garlic mashed potatoes and they were yummy as well. Everyone at the table enjoyed their food.  I did have a couple cocktails. My first cocktail was the Orange Moscow Mule. I did not enjoy it maybe it was the orange flavor or my disappointment that it was not served in a copper mug. What's the point of offering a Moscow mule when you don't have a copper mug if I would've known that I probably would not have ordered it. My next cocktail was the Raspberry Mojito it looked beautiful and it tasted yummy. It was a little on the tart side but I enjoyed it.   It's not cheap to eat there my ribeye was $45 but for two people definitely well worth it also there are sides it says they serve two people but you could probably share a side with four people for about 15 bucks. The drinks are $18 apiece which is normal for that type of restaurant.  Last but not least, the ambience is fabulous. The bar and restaurant area is surrounded by glass so you can see the north, south, east, and west sides of the valley with all the mountain views. We went before the sunset which is a must do if you plan on going there.  Even though prices might be a little high you need to remember this restaurant is on the reservation so there is no sales tax and as a reminder they include the gratuity already in your bill, 20%.",

Enough with the bad. I would give five stars for the experience after that point. We were seated at a nice table in the corner of the large dining room with a great view. Our server(David) was great. He made us comfortable, read the table well, and was able to describe and answer questions about the menu.    The Nosh platter for 2 with aged cheddar fondue was just slightly underwhelming.  We decided to split the elk loin with a mushroom tart side for two. I couldn't have been more pleased. I was told that the chef suggested at least medium rare on the elk but I was very hastily that i decided to go with rare. Perfectly rare and the best elk I have ever had.    It isn't cheap but the combination of food, service, and atmosphere is worth it. We went with a budget of $200 with tip and accomplished that with an appetizer platter, a shared meal, a shared side, 2 before dinner drinks, 2 glasses of wine with the meal, and we split a glass of porto with our decadent desert.   I want to do it again in one of the private couch booths with the $200 minimum.",

    "text": "This is a beautiful and worthy concept restaurant. The views are spectacular, service is top notch and food is amazing.  So, why only 4 stars? My wife made reservations on the Orange Sky web site for an early seating, requesting a western view to view the sunset (hence the name Orange Sky). When the restaurant called a couple days before our dining reservation, she was told we'd be sitting in a location with a partial view of the west, but mostly of the McDowell Mountains to the east and the golf course. She again asked the caller from Orange Sky to do what she could to get us a better view. After reading a few reviews, it became apparent to us the online reservation system does not necessarily ensure preferred seating. I called back to get the view we wanted and lo, there was availability. Annoying to say the least. If they get this squared away, the place could reach 5-star status.  The service and food was exceptional. I had the veal chop which was delicious. My wife had their NY Strip and it too was prepared excellently. Everything that came from the kitchen was beautiful in presentation and delicious on the palate. The wine list was going through some changes as the new Sommelier, Wednesday, was working on some new features. The list is quite nice, showcasing several decent value wines as well as the obligatory over the top Ch. Haut-Brion & Ch. Petrus. Both of these are available for stupid money.  I would return to OS, for the food, service and view again. It is certainly worth the price of admission in our opinion.",

We dressed up of course and we looked amazing! :)  I had made a reservation for two next to the window at private booth. I was a disappointed when he sat down in the middle of the restaurant not next to the window and was not private...  Being a vegetarian is a pain, but if course the chef whipped up something... and it was amazing, quinoa, fresh vegetables and the asparagus so tasty and crispy. :) the gnocchi... so chewy and had a weird after taste.. Mister order the steak, he said it was \"ehhhh\" He said the steak can be more juicy..  Love the patio view. So romantic looking over the city :)",

We shared the beef tenderloin for two, added the scallops with shrimp and wrapped in jalapeno bacon, mushroom ragout, and served with green chili mashed potatoes and asparagus with crispy pancetta.

    "text": "Wow, this is a hard one. I have been here several times for work functions and this last time for a nice Date Night with my husband. Hands down one of the most AMAZING views in town. They have these really cool high top private booths that face the sunset, and since my hubby is always planning the date nights, thought I would plan one for him.  First, I tried for 2 weeks to get a reservation at sunset. It was either 5pm with the seniors, 8pm or 9:45.  8pm it is which barely makes the sunset. Well, we were seated 20 minutes LATE (even though we were there 30 min early), but at least got to see the beautiful view of Camelback Mountain and watch the sunset from the balcony. Balcony is small and no handles on the doors so you get locked out once you shut the doors, so you have to knock to have someone let you back in!  Finally seated in our beautiful private booth. (BTW, it is $125 minimum on the weekend) We order some wine. We have to ask for bread, not automatically just brought. Bread was not that great, but before wine, I make sure to eat it! We ordered a dozen oysters, which we love. They only had 1 kind, and they were just OKAY....plus they only brought 1 TINY TINY lemon for the oysters for 12 oysters!! What?!?!  I despise horseradish and hubby loves it, was not very happy that they serve the cocktail sauce and horseradish together in the same bowl, so i have not choice by the end to eat some or ask for my own.  We ordered a bottle of Red Zinfandel. I strongly feel any restaurant that is $75-$90pp should automatically decant the wine, which they did not. At least the red wine was slightly chilled. (YES, i have become a wine snob after having lots of great wines, there is a HUGE difference when it is slightly chilled and decanted)  Dinner, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass ($32) and hubby had the New York Strip ($I think $30 something) along with a side that was a mix of quinoa, corn, green beans and much to my distaste-goat cheese. I HATE goat cheese and can always tell when it is in something. I asked the waiter if I had missed it in the description on the menu and he said no, for some reason they don't list it there and he has had quite a few complaints about it.  Sea Bass-needed salt badly. No salt and pepper were on the table, so I had to ask for it. I was pleasantly surprised the server came back w/ 3 kinds of sea salt-regular, bamboo and an alderwood type. The bamboo was my favorite and found my fish tasty after seasoning it.  Steak:Hubby said it was cooked fine but wasn't wowed by it.   Server was nice, but not what I would call fine dining material. He greeted us promptly and started to tell us the specials and then said he was getting old and forgot what they were.   Another odd thing, this restaurant is pretty large, and the bathroom in the restaurant is a 1 person bathroom. Very strange! There is another one in the lounge down the hall that is bigger.  Fun factor though there is great. in the lounge we ran into 3 different groups of people that we knew and had a great time. Then we went downstairs and just played some slots since Craps is my only real love and I don't do the video craps they have, I like the real deal.  SO, overall, great to experience it, sunset and view is AMAZING, place is hopping with all kinds of people, dining experience is subpar. I hands down would spend the money and Mastro's City Hall and just go to Orange Sky to meet up with friends for drinks when we can break away from the kiddos.",

    "text": "Romantic views- dining & service has room for improvement!  We stayed at the talking stick and went to this restaurant on a Sunday night. There is a private elevator and cocktail lounge right outside the hostess area.  As we are being seated our host asks if we would like a private room.  We said that sounded nice as we had never dined alone like that.  We had a spacious booth with a view to the west- not the most amazing ever but not too shabby.  We started with a bottle of red wine and the chefs cheese selection which was lovely.  Our server was a young confident guy who uncorked our wine perfectly.  He did explain the items in the chefs selection.  For mains the dish I wanted was sold out (sea bass) so I opted for the roasted chicken.  I wasn't starving and wanted something lighter than steak. This dish did not disappoint or thrill me.    My hunny had the demonico steak medium which was cooked nicely & seasoned.  He choose the horseradish sauce which wouldn't be my top choice but I could at least enjoy the 1 bite I tried.  *Overall our service was extremely extremely slow  *the music was a top 40 mix including Ke$ha and boy bands... I did comment to our main server about it.  It did not set an elegant tone and felt as if we were in there too late so the servers pick the music.  I don't classical music necessarily just something made for grown adults.  This is supposedly this elegant spot but it didn't feel like it.   Our server did invite us to enjoy the patio which was nice & we really would have rather sat out in the gorgeous spacious open patio.  Next time we will be sure to sit out in the open so they can see when we need service.",

One of the first things we noticed is we waited on our table for about 20 minutes and then afterwards once we were seated I counted at least 20 open tables in the dinning area we were in and that didn't include the exterior seating....Also when I asked about the private table the lady told me those book up a week or 2 weeks before and they don't have any availability but they remained empty the entire time we were there....Interesting just because such a nice restaurant you would think that this restaurant would over book for those that book 2 reservations and let their date pick and don't bother to cancel one of the reservations. The waiter Julio we had was an absolute GEM! He had such a sweetness and sincerity we just loved. He was just head on with his suggestions for food and we really enjoyed the experience even more with him helping us make our food selections. We loved the Elk cooked medium rare it was absolutely to die for. We also go the shrimp and scallop wrapped in bacon that we really enjoyed and topped off dinner with the lemon cheese cake which was really light and tasty as well.  We will definitely be back and hope you will take some of the thoughts I have put into this review into consideration when booking your restaurant to the \"T\". Someone like Julio could make more money as a waiter and be delighting lots of customers and it really would be neat to see that place full. Overall I loved it and had a really great time there!",

    "text": "It's very rare that Yelp does me wrong but it happened tonight.   To start, host was inattentive and disorganized which seemed odd once we sat at one of the few tables taken.   One of the reasons for selecting this restaurant was for the romance. Not tonight. Why the host sat us near a large ignorantly loud party I have no idea.   Onto the food. Shrimp cocktail on a block of salt. If the shrimp was fresh it may have been ok. Four large shrimp, one of which was mushy and bad. We told the waitress and she brought one back on a small plate. Main taste was salt.  I had a tasteless filet that they claim was 12 ounce. I figure it to have been closer to 8. It was tender but had little to no taste.   My wife had sea bass.  Flat and fishy, again, not very fresh.   We had no drinks, no sides and the bill for the poor service and food was over $100.    We found it odd that no waiter, waitress or host asked us how our meal was, they really didn't seem to care.  Scottsdale has some great restaurants but this isn't one of them, I wouldn't even use the word good.",

    "text": "I visited Orange Sky at Talking Stick before a concert. I did not have reservations which I highly recommend. The staff did after all do their best and got us a table with very little wait time. The table we sat at was in the middle of the room. The view is spectacular, wish I had a seat closer to a window. The wait staffs knowledge of the menu and their suggestions made our dining experience great. From the appetizer to the main course the food was cooked to perfection and it was delicious. My only wish is that they had a different dessert menu. Everything was chocolate ( which I can't eat) or ice cream. I was hoping unique dessert. Everything is 5 star and to offer a dish if ice cream just turned off the experience. I definitely give the meal five stars because who needs dessert anyways!   Can't wait to go again.",

My fiance and i really never go to upscale places but we are very glad we decided on this one. Im one that is not used to such catering when out to dinner so it was out of my element but a fantastic environment. Only one draw back would be the hostess. Im in retail and know the importance of a first and last impression, which is a huge part of a customers experience and patron retention. She was leaning on the hostess stand upon arrival. Im not possitive on what she was doing on her phone but it took a good time for her to acknowledge us. Not very pleasant or excited on arrival or as we left.",

    "text": "Driving up and down the 101 in Scottsdale, I watched as the new tower for the Talking Stick Resort rose majestically from the desert.  Well, this Saturday it was time to check out Orange Sky, their fine dining restaurant on the 15th floor.  Winding our way through the noise and smoke of the casino floor, we were able to find the bank of elevators that whisked us up to Orange Sky.  We entered the bar area and were greeted by panoramic views.  The golf course and mountains to the east and Phoenix and Camelback Mountain to the west.  The decor is very modern and contemporary.  Kind of a minimalist style that I really like.  We ordered a drink and watched the sunset.  An orange sky, indeed!  As we walked back down a long hallway to the dining area we noticed a few private booths for two people that faced west and looked like a nice romantic seating option for our next visit.  The menu was pretty straight forward with plenty of meat and seafood options.  I ordered a rib eye steak which was huge and cooked to medium rare perfection.  The smoked cheddar mashed potatoes and asparagus sides were very good also.  My girlfriend had the shrimp cakes which were shrimp wrapped around scallops with bacon.  It's pretty hard to go wrong with that combo!  The service was good and the dining area was very attractive.  Afterwards we walked outside and noticed that there was a large patio for dining as well.  On the way back out through the casino I played a couple of slot machines and actually won!  Like T Cook's, Prado and Deseo I think this restaurant is good enough that it will attract local diners as well as the resort guests.  All in all, our group really enjoyed the experience at Orange Sky.",

    "text": "When we made our dinner reservation we told them it was my birthday, just as the people behind us had advised them it was their 10th wedding anniversary. After waiting 50 min we were seated at a lonely table with no ambiance or view (they had moved all surrounding tables to accommodate a big group). We felt like kids relegated to the little 'after-thought' table at Christmas. When we requested a different table, they told us they had nothing else and we decided to leave.   On the way out we met the couple who were celebrating their anniversary who not only didn't get a bad table, they didn't get a table at all! When the hotel valet asked how we enjoyed our meal, we said we didn't get to eat and he replied, \"You have no idea how many times I hear that\". Clearly, this is not unusual and is a very disappointing result for what both couples thought would be a special evening.   I would only recommend taking an early reservation at this restaurant. It is obvious that they overbook and aren't efficient enough to turn the tables to accommodate the next seating. Also beware that it is a hike getting to the restaurant, which makes it inappropriate for many grandparents who might join a special occasion dinner. The valet is at the front of the hotel and you have to walk through a smoky casino before taking the elevator to the restaurant. After waiting in the bar for your table you have to walk that far again to the restaurant.  Only really amazing food could compensate for these problems and there are many great restaurants in the Valley that can deliver that. Thus, why not go to one who cares that it is a special occasion and treats it as a privilege to share that time with you?",

This place celebrates the desert and all things Arizona- the view is incredible in every direction, and the ambiance of the interior is just as stunning. When we arrived there was a lounge singer near the waiting area with a drummer and pianist accompanying her- we were taken back to our table and the menu was explained in great detail by our friendly server, Lisa. Once we ordered, we were encouraged to spend our wait for the food sipping our drinks on the 15th story patio that overlooks the golf course. I killed my smartphones batteries taking pictures of the wild horses wandering the outskirts of the property.  My wife ordered the pork chop- I had the Australian lamb. They were both very good- as were the sides, drinks and dessert (smore creme brulee). All in all, we spent two hours there and never felt rushed. The bill was expectedly high ($170 after tip- roughly the amount we paid for the room that night), but for me, eating here is a one-time thing anyway, so the expense isn't one I have to plan for in the future. Not really a place I'd drag my toddlers.  I highly recommend Orange Sky if time and money are no object.",

Beginning, leaving a voicemail to make reservations is not a good idea. This is a high class place, don't have first impression of not being just that. Also, I'm not sure why, with an expensive restaurant, the valet parking lot was full from the gamblers. I think it would make sense to at least accomodate the patrons that will be eating. So in we came, dressed to the nines, from the back forty. Not another great start. That all said, Orange Sky is breathtakingly beautiful! The food is fabulous! Fine dining at it's best... except for the three times we've been in the past year, the waiters need either more experience, or much better trained or both. Normally when fine dining the waiters are truly pro's.  4 stars is not a bad review so do yourself a favor and try Orange Sky. For management, I gave 4 because of the above mentioned; there are areas for you to improve and become the best Scottsdale has to offer. I hope you're listening.",

    "text": "The Thanksgiving prix fixe 4 course meal was one of the best meals I have ever had anywhere.  And I moved to Scottsdale 2+ years ago from one of those foodie Meccas, Austin, TX, home of Top Chef Paul Qui.  The first course, a Brussel sprout and hazelnut slaw, was outstanding.  The second course, a spicy shrimp and red quinoa dish that I thought had a touch of orange flavor, was also fabulous.  I liked that these first two courses were both super nutritious and insanely delicious.   The third course was prime rib or turkey.  The boys went with the prime rib with a mushroom grazy, mashed potatoes, and sauteed kale.  I went for the more traditional turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes, sauteed vegetables, and cranberry sauce.  The sugar snap peas were cooked to perfection, as were the other vegetables.  It was more than I could eat, but my son was happy to take the leftovers back to his dorm at ASU.  The dessert choices were limited and a trifle disappointing, but not enough to dampen my enthusiasm for all that had come in courses one through three.  We hope to make this a new family tradition and eat there every Thanksgiving.  I plan to eat there as often as I can.  While pricey, we basically got the meal of our lives for three adults for the same price one steak and a couple of sides would cost at qui in Austin.  The decor, ambiance, breathtaking views, and service were all that one could hope for.  Whoever their chef is, I think someone referred to him as Chef Ron; hang on to that guy!  We don't drink alcohol, so we cannot comment on the bar situation.  But we did eat at the bar and the service we received at the bar was outstanding.",

The food quality was also mixed. The views, however, are fantastic, and the private dining areas offer a romantic setting.  Here is a quick summary of our visit: - We waited a good 30 minutes before we were seated at our table. - After seating, we waited another 15 minutes before our waiter came to take our drink orders. And then another 10 minutes for our food order to be taken. - Our food order got lost. It took more than an hour after we placed our food order for our meals to arrive! Our waiter was mostly nonexistent during this time: Our drinks went empty, and we had to flag down someone else for refills. We seriously contemplated leaving because we were famished and frustrated! - Our waiter finally showed up about 40 minutes into our wait. He apologized and brought us a shrimp cocktail on the house. Our waiter later offered us free dessert (which we ordered To go for fear of another long wait). - Our entrees were good. I had the salmon which was very fresh and nicely seared. I thought the flavors were great. - Our sides were not good, and we left them mostly untouched. The pasta and pea dish was too salty to eat. It also contained a chunk of greens that would not separate and were therefore difficult to eat. Our fried green tomatoes tasted like a frozen dinner that they had microwaved.",

Consistantly disorganized, scattered and pitiful.  You have to strain to find a manger, server, bus boy etc.  The hostess always seem scared and confused when you ask them a question about your reservation.  Our last visit....and truly our last visit.....our server was seemingly professional, seemed to be in his early 40's...so seemed to be a career waiter and he seemed knowlegeable about the menu which was a pleasant surprise b/c former waiters had seemed ignorant about the menu.........we were jazzed b/c we thought finally Orange Sky \"gets\" that they have to hire and train their staff on appropriate/high end restaurant service.  Well Michael (our waiter) was a totall disappointment...he either was petrified of the chef or an arrogant d*ck.  We asked that our salads be chopped and he said the kitchen was too busy to chop a salad.  I explained that I would like to talk to a chef that wants his waitstaff telling customers that they are too busy to chop a salad......he said he would try to ask the kitchen to chop the salad for us, but they were really busy and he could not make any promises.  I again explained that our expectation is that our salad be chopped upon presentation and if it was not, we would not pay for that salad and would send it back and contiue to send it back until chopped.....he never relented to say that the salad would be chopped....just he would \"try\".  ( Of course the salad came chopped...but the interaction was strange.)  Then when two of us ordered our steaks, one of us ordered it medium well...after the waiter asked how she wanted her steak cooked.  When she said medium well....he said that it not the proper way to cook a steak and the kitchen prefers it to be cooked just medium.  So I said why even bother asking how she wanted her steak to be cooked and he said well he assumed she would \"know the proper degree of cooking for a filet\".  Again we asked for the manager and of course no manager came.  When our entrees arrived, the assistant waiter ( I think every table has two waitstaff or one in training...not sure) brought everyone's entrees but had no clue who got what and four of us got the filet.......but cooked at different temperature......when we asked if were receiving the correct steak....she said she did not know..and we should cut into our steak and figure it out ourselves......when the gal who ordered her steak medium well...cut into hers while the waitress was there, she could tell it was rare and she told the waitress and the waitress told her to \"swap with someone else at the table to find her right steak\".    So, not a rude or snotty staff....but running ragged, afraid of the chef or kitchen...but sorely .ill trained on fine dining and somewhat embarrassing on their lack of decorum for a luxury restaurant.  So have to give it only three stars.  I want to love this place...but cannot if the staff continues to be so sub par.",

The restaurant was SO cold! While my husband and I were waiting for our meal, we were prepared to leave because we  were both shivering! The silverware was ice cold! Manager said he turned down the A/C and it did begin to warm up. But then our entrees arrived........bones in the bass \"fillet\", overcooked salmon, cold corn side dish....very unpleasant. Do I ever pass up dessert? Did this night!! Was anxious to pay the bill and get out of there.",

At first 3 different people came to our table and took our wine water and food orders.  Then when I got my soup they didn't bring me a spoon.  So I sat there for almost 20 minutes staring at my bisque before the waiter came to ask me how it was.  It was cold by the time I finally got a spoon.  Then, it was 30 min later we were ready to walk out because they had not dropped of our entre yet and nobody had checked in with us.  Finally the steaks came and they were barely average.  Not worth the money.  This place is on the 15th floor and the view from our private booth was great but everything else was pretty bad.  Not recommended.  Such a shame because the setting is very nice.",

As for side dishes, the Asparagus and the Whipped Potatoes are amazing.  The anniversary cake for dessert is also delicious as well as the seasonal blueberry cheesecake that we recently had.

From the impeccable interior decor to the elegance of  the perfectly positioned indoor/outdoor fireplace! The views of the skyline are breathtaking and add instant romance to any dinner. However this is not just any dinner. The waitstaff makes you feel so cared for  and looked after that you feel weightless from the stress of the day! I was waited on by very charismatic lady with the loveliest British accent! She had such a great rapport with the people at the tables as well as mine. Effortlessly making sure you had everything you needed as well as throwing in a bit of British humor, which I found utterly charming and entertaining! Oh and the tenderloin..........just melted in my mouth as well as the chocolate surprise dessert they brought me without my asking to celebrate my birthday! How thoughtful! This is definitely the spot to impress, visitors or clients from out of town. But for me it could become an every weekend dinner. There is not enough great things I can say except for, Keep up the great work, Talking Stick Resort! And Orange Sky you definitely belong among the many wonderful restaurants in this amazing 5 star resort! See you again soon!",

I wish I would have made reservations earlier to sit next to the window but the ambiance of the restaurant was still good. Two of us for dinner had Calamari for an appetizer - good but nothing special. Had the coffee rubbed skirt steak with a shrimp and scallop wrapped in jalapeno bacon on the side. The skirt steak was delicious and I had a little red wine sauce on the side. One of the best steaks I have ever had. The shrimp and scallop were good too. My husband had the crap legs, which were already cracked and laying in a butter sauce. They told him that they were already cracked but not about the sauce, which he wasn't a fan of. The crab meat was good though. Had the green chili mashed potatoes which tasted like taco seasoning potatoes, least favorite part of the meal. Overall a beautiful restaurant to experience but will not visit too often due to the prices. Had a wonderful server and busser that were VERY attentive to our needs but not over-bearing. Great service!",

    "text": "let me tell you about this \"five star\" restaurant the Orange Sky. The view was quite spectacular and it had a charming elegant look to it. I know this because we had so much flippen time to look around. Our reservations were for 7:45PM and we were seated exactly on time. I was impressed. After we were seated the server arrived about ten minutes later and took our drink order (bottle of wine) and our food order. 40 minutes later the manager showed up with the wine. 15 more minutes our dinner arrived. My wife had the 12oz fillet of beef cooked to perfection and I ordered the rack of lamb med rare. It was raw. I sent it back. 15 more minutes and I hadn't even seen our server so I asked another server to send over the manager. She said which one? I said \"don't care, any or all\". The manager came over promptly and I told him the story of our visit and he apologized and said that they were very busy. Our server was responsible for our table and the one behind me and there were several empty tables around the restaurant. They sure didn't look that busy. Anyway, I told the manager to bill me for the wine and that we were leaving. He said I'll put two new orders in for you right now. My wife wouldn't eat until my rack arrived. I told the manager that we were leaving again and he said that he would comp the wine. This conversation with the manager lasted about eight minutes and my rack of lamb still hadn't arrived. We left and the hotel manager hooked us up with reservations at Ruth's Chris steakhouse which is where we should have went to begin with. We were greeted at the door and seated right away. Dinner was spectacular. I will never ever go to the Orange Sky restaurant again for anything more then to enjoy the view and have a glass of wine that will be ordered from the bar. 5 Star restaurant? I don't think so.",

The staff starting with the young woman at the elevator to the person who cleared our plates were very friendly and professional.  The view was beautiful.  I noticed that some of the arm chairs were a little overly worn out.  I think they should get some love and attention.  Our server was Teresa and she was great.  I thought the salmon could have been grilled slightly longer but I am not a connoisseur nor a chef but the presentation was lovely.  My side was a little disappointing because there was a flavor in the red potato dish that overwhelmed.  I am picky but my friend whose birthday it was completely enjoyed the generous serving of perfectly cooked calamari, the shrimp dish and his side of gnocchi.  They brought him a delightful and beautifully presented chocolate mousse crunch for his birthday.  I want the dessert chef's writing ability in chocolate!  It was wonderful experience and I would venture there again during the week.",

The restaurant itself was beautiful and the private booths would be a real treat but I doubt there will be a next time. The king crab was swimming in sauce and was $50 with not that much of a portion. The salmon was  undercooked.

She said o.k. and looked back down....we stood there for a little bit until we realized we were being intentionally ignored, we said we would wait right over here...(about 5 ft away)   After waiting for about 15 minutes a friendly woman came up and asked if we would like to get a cocktail or appetizer while we wait - I asked how long before our table would be ready (we HAD to take 5:30 reservation for the table, couldn't imagine it was taken)  She checked and informed us it was ready, soooooo all that standing for nothing - no \"enjoy your dinner\" or any professional comment from the dumpy hostess.  Our server was always timely but let's talk about the martinis we started out with.   The two martinis would have bought a bottle so we expected them to be top notch!   The glass was not chilled, the martini was a tad cooler than room temperature and one of the olives was one of those most people toss.  Then came the bread, room temperature, dry and unremarkable.  Salads were good, not great but good....steak was good, not great but good - was cheated on a half filled little bowl of bearnaise sauce (too early in the evening to run out!!!)   Chili whipped potatoes tasted like they used water instead of milk, maybe instant?  Just not good....cauliflower augrautin was o.k....not much to write about, little dry and lacking.   Dessert was o.k. but didn't taste fresh.  Yes, we made it to $200 with one disappointment after another.  So you wonder if the view made up for it???   Well, there's a parking lot, dirt field, frwy and then the sky....I'll leave the question up to you but we won't be going back, there's too many other great restaurants - all they had to do is kick it up a notch on each item to get the review they should have.",

You sit in a high-back booth facing the window on The 15th floor of the Talking Stick Resort & Casino.  The booths are separated by curtins and significant space so you never see anyone but your waiter and seldom hear other conversations.  Plan on spending about $100/person.

This review was going to be a 2 star, but after my horrible night, it definitely is a one.  It is not only that the prices are high, but the food is nothing special.  I like to eat and I couldn't find anything I really wanted.  I decided to order the beet salad, it was ok, but I had great ones in so many other places.  I should have stopped there and call it the night.  But since some of my girlfriends were ordering the Restaurant week menu, we had some more time to kill.  I asked to the Artichoke potato au gratin.  Big mistake.  It is really big size and I am glad I only ate half of it.  After that I felt I had a brick in my stomach.  I left my girlfriends around 10p.m. and I went home.  I couldn't sleep, I was so uncomfortable, and nauseous. Stop here if you don't want to be grossed out.  By 3:30 I couldn't take it and I was kneeling in front of my toilet.  It all came out undigested.  I was glad, but my throat was in pain.  Yuk! By the way I only had two glasses of wine.",

    "text": "This place is great!!!  My husband and I took my parents here for their 50th wedding anniversary anniversary and we were not disappointed.   Let me begin by saying you won't find a better view of the valley than from this restaurant.    We arrived while it was still light out and left at night so we got to witness the beautiful sunset.   The restaurant provides floor to ceiling glass windows that provide a 360 degree view of the valley.  Everything was topnotch.   Like another reviewer stated you do have two food servers which is great.   If you need anything during the course of your meal there is always someone close by to attend to your needs.   These are the items that were ordered by members of our party:  Antipasti Plate, Roast Pork Chop, Mixed Grill, Roast Rack of Lamb, Alaskan King Crab Legs, Crab Louie Salad, Wild Mushroom Risotto, artichoke au gratin.  Everything was superb!!    They did bring us out a special dessert complimentary due to the occasion.   All the drinks we ordered were prepared correctly also.   It is pricey so be prepared to shell out a few dollars but it's worth it.",

    "text": "I wanted to be wowed... I really did.  Any why wouldn't I? Date night with my lady at a restaurant that has received rave reviews... I definitely gave this place the benefit of the doubt. But alas, my three star rating is quite generous.  I'll start with the good-- the ambiance was perfect, the decor was tasteful.  We didn't get to enjoy the famous sunset view-- our reservations were at 8pm and it was raining, but even without the sunset, I thought the ambiance was tasteful and the staff was not pretentious.  I loved the very open,spacious feel of the bar and dining areas and the variety of seating options/configurations in the bar area.  The private booths facing the windows also seemed like a nice touch-- although we did not experience them as we were seated in the main dining room. Even though it was May, since it was rainy outside they had a gas fireplace going in the main dining room that added a nice coziness.  The food itself was okay-- inconsistent in quality and texture, but not inedible for the most part. We were there for Restaurant Week and selected a first course, entree, and dessert from the Restaurant Week menu.  As a note, we were informed by our server that none of the items on the menu for Restaurant Week are available normally-- that these were special offerings only for this week.  For my first course, I had the white asparagus salad. Not bad, but not remarkable in any way-- just standard salad with standard dressing. My partner had the roasted artichoke bisque which had a thin film on the top of it leading us to believe it had been sitting out for quite some time.  She commented that it didn't taste fresh-- like it had possibly come from a pre-made mixture.  In addition, it was loaded with pancetta-- which she said overpowered the subtle roasted artichoke taste with \"meatiness\". Ew.  The dinner rolls that were brought to the table were hard, and stale tasting (not \"crunchy\")--  the dinner rolls served at school cafeterias and nursing homes are tastier. Seriously.   For our entrees, we both ordered the grilled steelhead salmon. And cue the inconsistencies.... My salmon was fairly overcooked and quite dry.  To be fair, this is better than it being undercooked--  I'm normally a strict vegetarian, but I do enjoy fish occasionally even though it kind of creeps me out to eat an animal of any sort-- and rare/raw fish would have been a deal breaker for me.  The seasoning was tasty and overall I did enjoy the fish.  However, my partner's salmon came *very* rare-- like sushi rare.  It was seared on the outside, but cool in the middle.  Now I know it's typical for salmon to be served medium rare-- but this was RARE rare.   Both of our potatoes were very undercooked and difficult to eat.  The grilled campari tomatoes were the one delicious exception to the plate-- they were delicious, flavorful, and nicely presented.  Finally, there was a disparity in the temperature of our meals-- mine was piping hot, while my partner's was lukewarm at best.  Now mind you, we ordered the exact same entree that came out of the kitchen at the exact same time.  So why the difference?  My guess is that with it being Restaurant Week, the kitchen was pre-cooking these meals en masse and the attention to detail went by the wayside.  Nonetheless, not an acceptable excuse--Restaurant Week should be an opportunity for restaurants to highlight their best dishes and talents in hopes of bringing in more business-- not to churn out subpar food that turns patrons off from ever visiting again to enjoy their standard menu.    We both had the chocolate pot de creme for desert and it was completely delectable-- no complaints there.  The texture was smooth and creamy and the chocolate was flavorful without being too sweet or bitter.  I wonder if it is a coincidence that the best part of the meal was the one part of the meal that it is acceptable to prepare ahead of time?!   All in all, it was not a horrible experience-- the ambiance and dessert were wonderful.  I doubt I'd return again for dinner, but perhaps for cocktails and dessert.",

    "text": "What an outstanding dining experience!!!  While the food is more like a 4 - between the food, service, and atmosphere, I have to give it a 5.  We went here to celebrate my hubby's birthday.  Price-wise, it did cost what we would have spent on a little over our usual 3 Sat. nights out.  We did reserve a private booth and I am glad we did as it just adds to the whole experience. Sunset has moved a little more westward by the time they open so we didn't get an outstanding view of that but the overall view, especially  in the dark, was splendid.  Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable when it came to the details of the menu.  My husband likes all that \"heat\" seen on the menu but I cannot tolerate even a little as it totally destroys the food itself for me - all I taste is heat and what is mild to some, just kills my taste buds. You can Wasabi and horseradish me to death, just don't set my tongue on fire. So the waitress really helped me pick what could be easily adjusted to my liking of seasoning for which I will be forever grateful.  We split a shrimp cocktail which consisted of 6 very large shrimp. I make it myself a lot at home and two of the six were ever so slightly on the soggy side.  However, the cocktail sauce had shaved horseradish on top and made me forget about any flaw with the shrimp. My husband had the tomato bisque which I am sorry I didn't also.  That was outstanding.  I had ordered the Campari Tomatoes, white balsamic and sea salt. I am a tomato freak (NJ girl) but I would not order this again as it was not worth the price. Again, this is something I do myself at home.  Maybe regular balsamic would have been better or regular salt. Salt  was not on the table as I am sure the chef takes pride in the proper amount of seasoning and it is not the fault of Orange Sky as in many restaurants we frequent, I do not add salt except to raw tomatoes so maybe it is just me.  For dinner, hubby had the rib-eye with yellow tomato horseradish sauce and I had the flat iron steak with the garlic butter sauce. There is plenty of sauce to mix and match so we did.  I was worried the flat iron would be chewy but it was perfect. We added a side of the poached king crab for a surf and turf.   We shared smashed potatoes with pancetta, artichokes, and Parmesan.  Unfortunately, while the pancetta added to the flavor during cooking I am sure, the pieces were like hard little bits and would have been better if not included in the finished product.    Since there was a little mix-up on the soup order and we had to wait longer, they comped us (we didn't ask, they just did it.). They also gave my husband a complimentary dessert which was a chocolate mousse type of square over a crunchy layer of what we would find out later were rice crispies. In a million years, you would not guess rice crispies.  Drinks were pricey and we did order wine but like my husband said as the dinner was over \"we are worth it\".  I would definitely go back for another special occasion!!!  This is True dining folks.",

Made reservations one month in advance stating that it was an 18th birthday celebration for my daughters and requested sunset side table.  We were seated about as far away from the sunset as possible, and practically ignored all night by our waiter - waiting 30 minutes for our drink order when the place was practically empty at 5:15. Then dinner I think took easily an hour wait from the time we placed our order.  And the only reason I reviewed with two stars is because the food was delicious. When I asked to speak to the manager I was told he wasn't in.  The biggest kicker was having to pay our horrible waiter an $80.00 mandatory gratuity because we had six people in our party.  I think that's why our service was so terrible. Not going back for a loong time!",

    "text": "Great place to hang out on a random day of the week when there are no bands in town because it isn't a Friday or Saturday.  This restaurant has a lounge area which had a band on a Tuesday night and was fabulous to dance to.  I have gone twice and had a great experience both times but not necessarily because of the food.  I love the sustainably farmed salmon although I say it could have been improved with some amazing sauces and sides.  The problem with dishes that are not composed as is the case with the dishes here is when you pick your sides they don't necessarily pair well with the main entree.  My suggestion would be to carry a couple of dishes which are composed dishes and let them sing together in food harmony.  The second time I went I ordered the NY with horseradish cream sauce and devoured the entire steak.  Super YUM!!  Their wine list is vast which is good but at the same time, it leaves their servers with this huge amount of knowledge they will never be able to know.  They carry an amazing Arizona wine called \"Sand Reckoner\" but our server didn't know anything about it.  This is unfortunate because they could be selling local wines and especially when they are this good!!  When you get bored with the band upstairs, go down to the cigar lounge and enjoy a good solo singer who makes you want to get up and dance on the random day!  Enjoy a good cigar and a nice cordial.  Day finished sweetly.",

    "text": "yay! my 100th review :) So glad its a 5 star.  Hubby surprised me with a night out- He heard from a little birdy (gf Heather) that I wanted to try Orange Sky. This experience is probably slightly biased in that I was completely smitten from being surprised with a nice dinner at a beautiful place... but here goes :)  The valet area at Talking Stick is nicely lit and busy, good energy there. When you go to the elevator lobby for the OS, there is a receptionist that checks your reservation before you go up to the 15th floor in a glass elevator- oh, the view. Just amazing. Its the kind of elevator that makes you want to hit the emergency button and make out, except that now I'm old enough to think 1) elevators are probably really germy places 2) there's probably a camera in that elevator (not my thing so much, but I'm not judging), and 3) what if there was a real emergency? what kind of jerk would I be? ok, I digress.  After checking in with the hostess we got drinks at the bar. Yes, I know, people complain about the drinks being too expensive, they're $10-$15. But the price is comparable to any other high end restaurant in the valley, and they're all alcohol. I'd rather pay top dollar for a stiff drink than have 3 watered down drinks. The Sunset Martini was soooo good.   We were shown to our table, a big booth facing the fireplace, perfect for a romantic dinner. The service was fantastic, really- its what Mastro's was back in the day. I had the artichoke bisque (a special for Restaurant Week but I didn't want the rest of the menu, so they accommodated me and let me get it anyway)- it was very tasty (the pancetta didn't hurt). Hubby had a beet salad that he enjoyed, and got the scallops which were cooked perfectly. I had the shrimp/scallop steaks wrapped in jalapeno bacon and they were as good as they sound. We also got the smoked cheddar whipped potatoes (this was the only so-so part of the meal, they were on the bland side) and the mushroom risotto which was really good. Risotto is one of those things thats either cooked right or not, and it was done really well.   I can't wait to go back, it was really enjoyable.",

    "text": "My boyfriend surprised me with two nights at TSR for our anniversary. I have reviews of our experience of the hotel and the spa but wanted to write a separate review for  our experience at Orange Sky.  As my other reviews stated, service at this hotel overall is a bit mixed, maybe 2.5 stars at best. When we checked in at the desk on the Casino floor before going up to the restaurant, the man at the desk asked for our name and asked what time our reservations were for. We gave him the information and he asked again what our name was. I could clearly see were next on his list of names. We repeated it and then he just said 'ok', and another man walked over and hit the button to the elevator. No smiles from either, no 'have a nice dinner'. Neither one of them said anything more to us and it almost felt like we were interrupting their conversation.   Upon arriving on the 15th floor, the hostest informed us that our table would be about 10 minutes even though we were right on time. No big deal, we just took a seat in the lounge area and waited to get a drink. Our pre-dinner cocktails were okay but the service was slow and without a smile.  What are these people so crabby about? In addition, rather than take our order after having the menu's for 5 minutes, our waitress waited at the bar for what seemed like forever for 4 glasses of water to be filled for another table and chatted with the other waiters. Luckily once we ordered our drinks, they arrived fairly quickly and we were able to have one drink before our table was ready. Shortly thereafter, we were summoned to go with a hostest to our table.   We were lead through dancing couples on the dance floor and were sat in the second booth from the front.  The hostest never offered to pull out our table so it made it a bit awkward to get into but it was cozy once you sat down with all the pillows. We did have a nice dinner and the way the booths are positioned, it makes it feel very private...that is unless you have a noisy group next to you on the other side of the divider. Ours weren't overly noisy but you could clearly hear everything they were saying while we were busy eating.  Our waitress was more friendly after striking up a conversation and all the food was good. I had the sweet corn soup with the filet and the bf ordered a salad with the ribeye. Not anything particularly memorable but it was good.   We were given a dessert for our anniversary but can't say whether it was free or not since I didn't pay the bill :) It was good, some sort of chocolate cake with hazelnuts with some very pretty penmanship wishing us happy anniversary. It was the best service related touch we had received the whole evening.   We missed the sunset during dinner which I'm sure would have added to the experience but watching highway traffic whiz by on the 101 after dark isn't overly romantic in my opinion. Even if there are mountains in the background. Overall though, given the mediocer service at the front, the standard steak affair on the menu and lack of atmosphere past dark, I can't say that I would go back.  If you do decide to go anyway, make sure you go early enough to catch the sunset!",

Suggestion: Request a window seat. Some prime locations ( facing west) have a minimum charge\" The east side is fine as well. There are many booths in the middle of the restaurant, but it doesn't seem like you get a good view of the area. As you walk in to the dining area, you pass the kitchen. It is quite a show. It is spotless from our view and the folks working there looked great. It is fun watching all the activity. Now to the good part. We had a wonderful waitress- Elyssa who made us feel like we were the ONLY customer she had. She was super. It is not inexpensive, and is alacarte. But for a special occasion--it is the place to go. They have some great items on the menu. A couple of items that stood out. The Caesar Salad. They prepare it a slightly different way. Delicious. I had the skirt steak and added the \" SHRIMP & SCALLOP STEAKS* (3) prawns and divers wrapped in jalapeno bacon.\" Wow. And a side dish I would recommend- are the \" Crushed potatoes\". Never saw them prepared that way before. Very good. With wine and desert a couple will get to around $200.00. Between the wonderful service ; the views; the food, I whole heatedly recommend the Orange Sky",

Though the glass in food incident did put a slight damper on things, the staff made up for it by taking two entrees off the bill and also gave a complimentary Anniversary dessert.  Overall, was I blown away by my steak/sides... no, not really, but the service and ambiance made up for it.

We've dined there several times in the past with excellent results. Last night, however, did not measure up to those previous experiences. Most disappointing was the menu. Where in the past there were oysters and,other great appetizers, this time it was mostly salads. The entrees were good, but the selection was limited. All-in-all I wouldn't go out of my way to dine there again. There are restaurants with just as good menus and quality closer to home.",

Took my ID and read the date, continued to take it back to scan it after \"scanning\" it told me she couldn't serve me because it wasn't turned the correct direction. Obviously this person was bitter and had something up their ass because I had been served all day at other restaurants, bars, and the pool at this resort. Worst restaurant of them all and the food was not good. Definitely never coming back after being treated so poorly. Pricey rude and not worth my time.",

    "text": "Wonderful restaurant!  My husband and I dined here for our anniversary.  Upon arrival, you'll be whisked to the top of the resort in a private elevator which opens to a lovely lounge.  The piano player is definitely a nice touch.  There your hostess will greet you.  Yes, greet you.  No employees huddled in private conversation.  My husband requested a private booth for sunset.  Once I relocated half a dozen pillows in the booth, I settled in to the table overlooking a wall of drawn shades.  There were a couple side chairs in the corner as well.  I'm assuming this is so your dining partner has somewhere to sit in the event you overdo it and need to lie down in the booth between courses.  At the magic hour, the blinds were raised and there was a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows with lovely mountain views and a setting sun.  Very romantic, but let's get to the food.  We started with a small iced shellfish platter with king crab legs, oysters, mussels and shrimp.  The crab legs were already cracked which I appreciate greatly.  For my entree, the mediterranean sea bass with leeks and mushrooms in a white wine sauce.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, perfectly eaten.  For sides we shared the fried green tomatoes and the cauliflower gratin.  The gratin was sinfully rich and creamy.  The tomatoes were nicely fried, but not quite tender enough.  We were given a complimentary dessert as well.  Service was impeccable from start to finish.  I felt the pricing was more than reasonable for a restaurant such as this.  Our meal was somewhere around $250, excluding tip, but that also included flowers for me (which were beautifully done!) and a bottle of wine.  They do have a dress code that while enforced, it's not terribly strict..mostly no t-shirts, ripped up jeans, flip-flops, etc.  Nothing that would kill any of us to abide, even in the middle of July.  Note to husband...would love to go again!!",

That being said, my evening there was flawless, & gotta hand it to GM Nick Colwell.  He has an amazingly talented, superior staff, and they seamlessly manage to make you feel very special and attended to, even while they serve 300-400 dinners around you!  Great job in guding the ship, Nick.  The food and wine list reward you with the meal of the year.  Get settled in and enjoy an amazing culinary experience while watching amazing views of the sunset over the McDowells and Camelback Mountain.  Can't wait to return!",

Food met my expectation and loved the sweet potato side.My daughter did get a gritty scallop-- it happens.

Went to a birthday party here where we paid in advance to partake of appetizers. $30 a head included am array of cheese cubes, a clump of blue cheese and some cooked veggies that were slimy and cold. The drinks were tiny pours in glasses with slanted bases to make it look like you are getting more than you are! To top it off the server decided to add her own gratuity of 22% and not tell us about it. There was just two of us on the bill. Our friend noticed his bill and the tip they added was higher than his entire bill! If you look out you may catch a nice view of the sunset but if you look down it's just brown dirt! Not good food, not good drinks, not good service! One star is generous!",

    "text": "9/26/10  I am overjoyed w/ my decision to have dinner here on the last night of Restaurant Week despite three days' of failed attempts to get out of work early enough to enjoy the sunset views!  The terrific value on such a delicious meal coupled w/ a great perlustration of the eternity pool/fountain in the patio deck made up for the missed survey of the desert mountain landscape (don't forget the beautiful Talking Stick golf course, resort pools, and water fixtures!).  Besides the two restaurant lounge areas, private dining booths, two Chef's tables ($2000 minimum ticket), and a large, yet intimate, main dining area, there are many \"pockets\" brimming w/ positive energy in the patio where one can enjoy a cocktail (or not!), catch up w/ friends, or just linger and take in the beauty of the space.  Before or after dinner, you can also enjoy a bit of live music (tonight featured a pianist)-- loved the aeronautic-themed chairs!    Enough on the atmosphere, let's get onto the food!  For Restaurant Week, Orange Sky's $39 menu featured:  APPETIZER: Lobster bisque; Half-dozen of iced oysters; OS dinner salad. MAIN COURSE: Filet of beef; Grilled half-chicken; Herb-crusted Pacific yellowtail tuna. DESSERT: Chocolate dome; Lemon semolina cake; Choice of gelato or  sorbet.  If I didn't have food allergies to worry about, I would've chosen the oysters to start; the tuna for the main, and the lemon cake to finish.  Instead, I ordered the salad, the filet, and the crowd-pleaser chocolate dome, and what a wonderful meal they made!!  The salad was comprised of greens and spicy candied walnuts dressed in a roquefort-sherry vinaigrette, and sprinkled w/ a few dashes of toasted shallot ribbons.  The sherry vinaigrette gave the salad a lovely, smooth, and mild flavor.  That is, until I'd bite into a roquefort crumble, which lent a welcomed burst of tang and pungency!  The combination of candied walnuts, roquefort, sherry, and shallots might not be for everybody, but I loved it- a great way to stir up my appetite!  The twin tournedos of beef filet were truly remarkable!  Cooked to medium, the filet was lovely to behold, and even more delightful to eat- the sauce choron, a bearnaise variation, that supplemented the dish made for a perfect pairing!  The steaks also came w/ two roasted sweet peppers, a few asparagus spears (a few I found were slightly overdone, but still very good), and silky mashed potatoes.  (I personally like a bit of texture in mashed potatoes, so I was very happy to find that this specimen wasn't TOO silky.  Alone, it was a tasty side, but after tasting the meat, the potatoes could've used a bit more seasoning.  However, I feel it's better to have to add more seasoning after than to have too much and not be able to enjoy a dish at all!)  I really appreciated that the steaks were presented twin-style instead of one whole-- I was able to enjoy a small serving and still have some room for dessert!  And oh, what a great dessert I had!  Drum roll please... The chocolate dome, made in-house, presented w/ two blackberries and a glaze of white chocolate and bitter orange.  The dome itself was a \"hard shell\"  of chocolate ganache (it really wasn't hard at all, and I personally would've appreciated the \"break\" of a chocolate bar here), sprinkled w/ almond brittle, and inside lay exquisite mantles of chocolate mousse and chocolate cake, which sat on top of a chocolate cookie!  While the dessert looked very rich and decadent, it was surprisingly light (I had three glorious bites before putting it aside to move onto the gelato).  I definitely wanted to take some of this cake to enjoy later at home ;)  The gelato, while not made in-house (or so the server believed), was equally satisfying- the coffee flavor was quite delicate-- this was a scoop to be savored ever-so-slowly, like a favorite spirit to be sipped over time, and not chased down.  I also had a cup of Peet's coffee to go along w/ dessert.  I waited a very long time to experience Orange Sky, and what a remarkable evening I had!  I will be back very, very soon!  p.s.  Small details, such as pretty dinnerware and embedded crystals in silverware (although I noted fingerprint smudges all over- tsk, tsk!), friendly and courteous service, and the lovely upgrades to the fixtures and decor really added to my overall satisfaction w/ my OS experience.  I would suggest everyone try Orange Sky at least once, but make sure you arrange yours w/ a sunset reservation!  (Unless, of course, you quite enjoy looking at the tops of brightly lit parking lots!)  p.p.s  Recall those private dining booths I mentioned?  They're certainly worth checking out if you value some privacy-- the tables all face panoramic views and certainly keep prying eyes from seeing who are seated.  [The only giveaway to the tables' occupancy was the pockets of barely discernible conversation my ears picked up as I walked by.  Visual inspection of the tables would have you believe that the booths were empty.",

    "text": "We dined at Orange Sky last Saturday and the place was packed! The casino was full and so was the restaurant.  We had a party of 11 and were not so lucky to get a super long table from tip to tail. Use the potty before you sit down in the large comfy chairs because backing them up for a break can be interesting.  The service seemed great at first and then went progressively downhill. The servers should probably learn how to do magic tricks and make balloon animals to entertain the customers while they are waiting and waiting and waiting.  The restaurant was out of lobster for a 7PM seating and after 3 people ordered oysters they came back to say they were out of those as well.  The crab Louie salad had an odd flavor to the dressing and 3 unexplainable crustini's that you couldn't cut or pick up.  Tough and slow seemed to be the buzz words at the table. I had the pork chop and it was so dry I felt like I could blow dust out of my mouth while trying to muster up enough saliva to swallow it.  Everyone that ordered steak said they were tough and overdone. The beef comes from Arkansas.  The asparagus was the size of my big toe and was recommended over the brocolini.  They graced our birthday boy and girl with a fabulous chocolate mousse desert which was very good. As we all stared and shared they came back 10 minutes later to see if anyone else wanted desert, but the chocolate mousse was not an option.  When the one dreaded desert order was taken I ordered a hot tea which had at least a half of a cup of tea leaves in a two cup pitcher. Can you say, \"tea buzzzz\"?  Maybe they need to read some of these reviews as these seem to be common complaints.  The venue is very very nice and I think you know what I think about the rest.",

Well we made a reservation earlier in the week and even added it was for our anniversary. We were seated about two feet away from the couple next to us. We could hear everything the they were saying and vice Versa. It was very awkward. We ended up leaving before the food arrived so can't comment on quality. I just didn't want to spend $150 for a long awkward dinner.",

Me and my date called to make reservations in a private booth for dinner but when we got there they had us waiting for 20 minutes and we went to the bar while we waited and never even got our drinks because the bartender was having an issue with something. So we finally get seated and it's a gorgeous set up and view but the service was so terrible. The servers were very rude and after they seated us at one table someone else came and had us move to a different table (closer to the dining room) which was much louder and less private. We ordered some drinks and it took over 15 minutes just to get them finally the manager come over and said everything was okay because apparently there was an issue with my drivers license being speculated. At this point we had been there over 45 minutes and hadn't even been served drinks. The sunset was almost practically over and we ended up leaving entirely because the whole experience was ruined. I am very disappointed with the way the staff was acting (rudely) and the service (non service) we received.",

Despite booking well ahead and letting them know in the reservation and when they called to confirm the reservation that it was an important celebration which is why I requested a table where we could see out of the windows (not the booths), we were seated at a 2-top where we couldn't see the sunset, a private party was on the deck so we couldn't go out there, and we felt like we were sitting 5' apart from one another at their 2-top. The 2-tops were so close on either side that the romance that could've been was a lost opportunity. Very disappointed and somewhat embarrassed after I had raved for weeks about how awesome and romantic this restaurant is.

That's why I was excited to start the new year's day 2013 with my family.   I stepped out of my routine of ordering a Malbec or temperanillo with my meal, and ventured to ordering an Old Fashioned. They do it well here! I'm almost thinking about making the picture I took of it my phone wallpaper because I always want to remember it!   My family ordered oysters to start as always. One of the oysters I chomped into contained a special surprise... A pearl! Don't worry, I didn't break a tooth or anything, but it definitely surprised me when I was chewing and thought, \"Wow, this is a huge piece of grit in my oyster,\" and was shocked to find a small pearl! I guess that doesn't always happen, but I will look for another when I eat oysters so I can make earrings or something!  My twin beef tournedos (mini twin filets) was just as amazing as always paired with the Bernaise sauce. I actually split it this time with my friend so we could try their special for the night... A chilean sea bass sitting on lobster cakes topped with an Asian glaze type sauce. Usually I love sushi, so cooked fish seldom impresses me, but this sea bass was incredible, especialyl mixed with lobster cakes. Who wants crab cakes, when you can have awesome lobster cakes, right??",

I rarely give 5 yelp stars on my reviews. Yeah, I'm that picky.  We've known about this place for years, but just never seemed to make it over there. My loss. Totally my loss. Wow! We went there to celebrate our 19th anniversary. Easy parking, and plenty of it. After we parked, we went inside and followed the signs to Orange Sky. It was a bit hard to find because it's accessed by a specific set of elevators that are inside the casino. Once we arrived at the restaurant (15th floor) we were greeted with a very hip, lively ambiance.  There's a lounge close to the elevator, where there are plenty of places to, well, ... lounge. Large full cocktail bar and there was live music. If I had known it was such a destination, we would've gone early to have a few drinks.  Instead we went to the maitre d and were seated. There's all kinds of seating you can choose from. There are quite a large number of private cubbies facing the glass wall so you can enjoy the sunset (seats up to 4), there are larger rooms decorated with wine bottles (seats 10), main dining area, patio, and larger banquet rooms for large parties (25+, 50+). The patio is a large space outside (with heaters) where you can eat alfresco. Inside the main dining room is very elegant and spacious.  We chose the main dining room. Our server, Julio, was simply one of the best servers we've ever had. He first wanted to know how we wanted to pace ourselves -- if we were on a timeframe or not. We said we weren't on a timeframe, and wanted a leisurely dinner. We ordered cocktails and he encouraged us to leave the table, walk around the patio, admire the view, and he would bring us our cocktails wherever we were. That was fantastic.   Once we finished our cocktails on the patio (yes he found us!), we went back inside, ordered apps and wine. The food came quickly and was simply perfect. Dinner came after that and I must say, the steak I ordered was delicious. Dessert consisted of grappa and a small 'anniversary' dessert. We rolled out of there, we were so full.  This place is a bit pricey, but it's an amazing restaurant with awesome ambiance and definitely a place to go for a fancy date, romantic dinner, or just to impress the boss or out of town guests.   But when you go, please request Julio if you remember. His name was on a different review for this restaurant and for good reason. He'll give you awesome service!",

We came here for my birthday along with our second year of being together. Our waiter Kat was genuine and provided the most exquisite service. I started the night off by ordering a \"blood orange sky martini\" and that was enough to get me quite tipsy. The amount of liquor in there was more than I probably should have consumed. It was delicious and very sweet.  We then ordered our dinner which was the \"17 oz rib eye\".  This steak is so juicy and flavored to taste like a filet mignon. Out of the 17 oz of steak there was less then 1 oz of fat on it. It was trimmed to perfection. We also ordered the \"Foraged Mushroom Ragout\". Those were very different but a good different. They were almost in like a creamy rice mix. I loved it. Because it was our anniversary/my birthday they gave us a complimentary dessert that was very tasteful and beyond sweet.",

She went on and on about how much the minimums were to sit at private tables, and for the private dining room etc. This was not the time or the audience for this.   Add that to the heinously smoky casino you are forced to walk through and I have no desire to return. Especially when there many other choices just as good.",

Give the chef specials a try and you can never go wrong with the brussel sprouts.   Save room for desert as the lemon cake is fascinating.  Life on the edge of greatness with outside dining too. The Ryder up to the 15th floor will change your attitude.  If the night lingers on, consider a few songs to dance to in the club one floor below.",

We requested a patio table outside and because it was a hot day, we had the entire patio and Elyssa all to ourselves.... lucky us!! She coordinated our courses perfectly so that we had time to relax and enjoy the spectacular view before heading downstairs to our show. Looking forward to returning very soon and bringing a group next time. Ask for Elyssa, a patio table and that incredible skinny margarita with jalapenos. Wasn't on the menu, but Elyssa made it happen. Cheers!!",

This is an elegant fine dining establishment, but people were there in flip flops, running shoes, casual shorts, wornout jeans, tee shirts, etc...this brought down the whole experience that such a restaurant should be able to command. It takes several weeks to get a reservation, especially for a table with a western view which has a $200 per table minimum, so they should require collar shirts, no flip flops, and the like, i.e. business casual minimum. Having the guests dress up for dinner creates a classy atmosphere which leads to a pleasing diningexperience. When people wear their better attire, they reflect a different demeanor, this change would create a positive elegant atmosphere throughout the restaurant.",

I was fortunate enough to be gifted with a Package won in a silent auction from the march of dimes. The package included a 2 night stay at the resort, a 90 minute couples massage and a $50 gift card. We figured we would book dinner at Orange Sky and use the gift card toward the dinner. When we showed up they informed us that we would be having a one of a kind, off menu experience as part of our package. It turned out to be a 7 course meal paired with wine at each course. We are adventurous and love to try new things, so we were super excited. Each course was better than the next. The wine was beautifully paired.  Above all, the food was outstanding. I have eaten at a lot of ravely reviewed restaurants and I would have to say, this was the BEST meal I have ever eaten. Complements to the chef!! A big thank you to our server (Wes...I think?.....you gave us a LOT of wine) and a thank you to Orange sky/ the talking stick for supporting the March of Dimes by offering such an amazing package. Also, I have to thank the best CPA ever, Jim Laubham (capital accounting Ahwatukee), for this amazing gift. If you win it again next year, I highly recommend you keep it for yourself!",

    "text": "We wanted to find a super romantic place for our Anniversary. After a lot of reviewing 5 star romantic restaurants in Scottsdale. We decided on Orange Sky for the PATIO area view. We made online reservations for a Saturday night at 5:15pm in order to see the sunset at dinner. About a week later, I called to confirm my reservation, I was told everything was in order and we have a note to put you on the patio.   A few days later, my boyfriend called just to ask about the dress code and again confirm our reservation. He was told that we no longer could be sat in the PATIO area and that a large party booked the entire PATIO area. He was quite shocked to learn that we had been booted out of the table we really wanted. He spoke with a lady manager (no name) she told us that this happens and would be putting us in the dining area now. We only booked here for the sunset view, but now we are unsure where we will be. We were pretty disappointed that we wouldn't have a view. But decided to go anyways.  Upon arrival, you have to wait a few minutes just to check in and get into the elevator. Then at the restaurant, we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. Expecting to be in the middle of the main dining area, we were surprised that we were taken to a private booth facing the sunset on Camelback Mountain. We were thrilled! That lady manager really made our Anniversary!!   Our waitress Maggie, she was GREAT!! Very nice and attentive. Will ask for her again. The food was great too, but we both agreed that when we go back we would just do wine and a appetizer and dessert.  The main courses were good but lacking flavor. Then at the end of the night she brought us a Happy Anniversary Dessert, Very pretty and tasty. All over experience I give it 4 out of 5 stars.",

    "text": "The restaurant is by far one of the nicest in town. Our server was attentive and service was quick. However we had a few minor issues. 1. Husband ordered the brentwood corn and although not a normal request he asked for the duck egg to be poached hard. Server said no problem but then it arrived soft. I can eat soft, so it was fine for me, but sort of disappointed that they chose to ignore his request.  2. My side was Agave and Chili roasted carrots. I'm assuming they roasted them to aldente, but some were hard as a rock while others were soft.  For $10 sides they should all be consistent and cooked to perfection.  3. The desert options were pretty limited for such a nice place. I order some sort of cigar crepe. It was horrible. Ice cream was the best part but how do you screw that up. The cigar crepes seemed like something my kid would make in my own kitchen when there was nothing else to make. My suggestion is to take this off the menu. 4. Then finally the biggest mistake of all is that when the bill arrived it was nearly $500. After almost having a heart attack we saw that the server added 4 other entrees to our bill. I am assuming it was an honest mistake, but really double checked the bill after that.  We didn't let these minor details ruin our evening. My husband had the steak and I had the sea bass. Both cooked to perfection and were delicious, and the oyster appetizer was incredible. The liquor was poured generously, so that helps, but they may want to watch over serving. There was a woman who made a scene and had to be escorted out.  Not something you normally see in a fine dining environment but made for a good dinner show.  My husband and I dine out frequently and we have our favorites list for celebrations. Unfortunately this one will not make our return list.  When we pay that much, it's gotta be perfect.  Sorry you missed it Orange Sky.",

They had an attitude- very rude-The Restaurant was empty and we were told we had to go to our Table because they weren't going to hold our table any longer.... there was no one in the restaurant. The Hostess went to the Manager and she came back and said yes you can stay for a few more minutes.. Really.. When it took 20 min. to get a drink- that was the wrong drinks... The Cocktail waitress was very busy talking to the bartender and we sat there waiting... We were definitely an inconvenience... In 5 minutes the Hostess came back to get us and take us to our Table.... The Wine had turned- the bottle was bad and we had to order a second that was more expensive... Our Bill for two was almost 300.00 and to be treated like we were an inconvenience is just not work the great view... They say they have a dress code but when we were leaving a group  came in and were seated with frayed jeans and cut offs and  tee shirts. Not dressed appropriately..

Upon arrival for our 5:00 p.m. sunset dining with a private booth reservation, we were asked to wait in the bar while they got ready for us.  We ordered drinks and waited and waited while others were seated -even after we asked twice it was probably 30 minutes after our reservation time before we were seated and missed the majority of the sunset.  The piano music while we waiting sounded recorded.  The waiter and bus boy were not the level of professionals you would expect for the restaurant.  Nice but goofy.  The private dining booth was wonderful.  Now on to the food.  Oysters great.  Son-In-Law's Rib Eye Steak - wonderful.  My pre-cracked crab wonderful.  My daughter's scallops - disappointing to her to get only 4 scallops on her plate.  Mashed potatoes OK.  Asparagus disappointing - tough.  Bread OK.  Huckleberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream - yummy.  The outdoor patio - breathtaking.  So C for service.  B for food.  A for ambiance.",

The SHRIMP AND SCALLOP STEAKS were good, but the bacon was not crisp, and the presentation was a little cumberson.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of eating at Orange Sky lastnight saturday evening. We had reservations at 5:30 to celebrate a friends birthday.  As previous reviews stated, there is a dress code, and a private elevator up to the restaurant. We were seated immediately and greeted by 3 servers.   Our main server was very knowledgeable about the menu and answered any of our questions. Restaurant week had just begun that day and she explained that menu.There was some confusion when it came to the restaurant week menu.  I did not opt to do restaurant week however, one of their dishes was on the main menu and priced seperately so I was under the impression I could order that dish seperate. When my dinner came, it had no sauce as the menu stated it would, and it lacked the extra flair. The waitress, Lisa, was quick to bring it back to the kitchen and have them fix it. She stated it is confusing and they were expecting it as it was the first night of restaurant week. I enjoyed the dinner from there on out.   Also, our water glasses were often and that is a plus to me!  One complaint I had, was regarding my wine order. I had left the table for some time while the others at my table had ordered a glass of wine. When I came back, the servers had failed to ask me if I wanted another glass of wine. I had to then ask for the wine menu and take it from there.   Overall, a great experience, and would go back for a special occasion!",

Last night we started our experience with the leaving us waiting at the hostess stand for 30 minutes despite the fact they weren't busy. Did I mention my wife is 6 months pregnant?  When we got our table it looked very promising. We had 2 servers. At first I thought it was because 1 was in training, but I soon realized there were 2 servers for each table. In the end we got the service equivalent to having 3/4 of a server.   The food was good, but not worth the cost.",

If you care about the origin and quality of what you consume this may become your favorite restaurant!  Our group tried salmon, scallops, sea bass and center cut filet. We sampled each other's meal but liked our own and were all unwilling to share more than a bite. We liked the cauliflower gratin and kale (with a cayenne kick) sides too.  For dessert we again shared a panna cotta and a chocolate treat; both were delicious.   And then we enjoyed the orange, pink, red, blue, purple light play over Camelback and sunset beyond Mummy Mountain in Paradise Valley...",

    "text": "Cracker Barrel in the sky! Unremarkable over priced food presented on plain white plates. While the service was fine, the view from our private dinning booth at sunset was non existent. The only way to watch the sunset was to leave our booth, traverse the dining room and walk out on the patio, not exactly what you would expect when you agree to pay the $200 minimum for the private dining/sunset experience.  As for the food, the $12.50 Caesar salad could have come from Denny's, the bread plate included just two varieties of sliced bread, no rolls, nothing special at all. The appetizer cheese board tasted fine but again the presentation was lacking. I ordered the rib eye steak, it could be cut with a sharp knife and some effort preceding a long chew!  I also opted for the \"Oscar\" sauce for my steak. I expected a seafood mixture in a tasty sauce to compliment my steak, what I got was two pieces of crab, each about the size of my index finger, resting on top of the steak and a bowl of some sort of sauce. I should note that this was an \"off menu item\" thus no price was listed. It was $32, ridiculous, even for this place! Lesson learned, next time I'll spend a little more and dine at KAI.",

We sat in the restaurant area and as we were guided to our table, employees smiled and greeted us. The service was incredible and professional. The food choices included a variety of foods including scallop steaks, elk, steak, seafood, and lots of vegetable sides.  The wine list was extensive. We enjoyed wine by the glass: the Merlot and Tempranillo were tasty.  We started with the cheese board which offered 6 different cheeses, bourbon cherries, local honey, almonds and some bread. Our server described them all and they were all delicious, especially the smoked blue cheese.  Our table ordered the elk, beef tenderloin, and shrimp and scallops wrapped in jalapeno bacon. The bacon was a bit spicy but didn't impede the ability to eat and enjoy the dish. We also ordered the side of asparagus and the corn which was a mix of sweet corn, asparagus, chard and bacon. We finished off with Peet's pressed coffee and the Frozen Chocolate Dome and Rhubarb Tart.    All the portions were just the right size that we finished everything.  This is definitely a place we would visit again. The dress code states business casual so it didn't have that stuffy dressed up feel to it.  We came directly from work and were dressed appropriately.",

    "text": "Orange Sky is the signature fine dining restaurant at Talking Stick Resort.  People come here for special events and the sunset views and we came for the food.  OS has a great selection on wine and for starter, we ordered the braised beef cheek stuffed marrow bone and wild arugula and pickled apple salad.  They were interesting.  For main course, my hubby had the New York steak with red wine sauce and I had the halibut with their special feature, an creamy Asian style side dish with baby shiitakes.  The side dish was drowned in cream and I simply couldn't handle it.  My hubby enjoyed his meat!  We also had a dessert to share.  Overall, the food was just okay, with beautiful setting and topnotch service.",

The shelled Alaskan King crab legs are delicious!  Also tried the mushroom bruchetta, a must.  The green chili whipped potatoes.   Yum!!  The birthday dessert was a gift from Orange Sky and it fabulous!  I will always come back for the views, service and food!  Thank you for making my 50th a full happy belly affair!",

    "text": "Came in from Michigan for our anniversary and chose Orange Sky for Anniversary dinner. Upon entering, had to sit and wait to be taken back (I made our reservation 1 month in advance). Upon entering we noticed that the majority of the restaurant was empty. Despite making my reservation a month in advance at \"sunset hour\", we were taken to the direct opposite side of the restaurant next to the servers stand with a view of the kitchen. Oysters were nothing short of basic (we can get better back home), beef tenderloin appetizer was just ok, a bit spicy if that would bother you. We ordered the scallops in wrapped jalapeno bacon which was extremely spicy and the swordfish that came out dry as a brick. Another server who wasn't our server or a manager asked how our meals were and we told him about the swordfish at which point he agreed that it looked horrible and suggested the salmon. Ok fine. 20 minutes later the salmon comes out and it is over cooked. We had a squash side that was the best part of our meal. Then another came out as perhaps they were trying to compensate? No one told us why tho. They also brought me another drink after I told them I didn't want another one. The service was nothing short of being ignored. Our waiter had 3 other tables of groups of 10 or more! We were waited in by 3 different people. A guy we had never seen before asked us if we wanted dessert from the servers desk! Are you kidding me? This was not first class anything. We had better meals the entire remainder of our stay in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area. After 3 hours of this circus, the Manager came over, apologized and told us our food would be comped. The bill showed up with the drink I didn't order on it. We asked for that to be removed, paid for our other drinks and left. And we had to chase the waiter down to pay so we could leave! Upon leaving I actually wondered if we would have had a better meal at the buffet.",

The private dining booths are nice. This was our first time sitting in one of those. Our server Gabrielle was very good but overall the food just isn't as good as it used to be.

Not because of the food presentation, which was lovely. Not because of the decor and location, which was done somewhat modern on the top floor of Talking Stick. Definitely not because of the views, which were fabulous.  I likely won't becoming back because of the overall cost. A dinner comprising the least expensive entree on the menu and a small salad, no beverage, no dessert and no coffee will run about $50, plus taxes and tip.    Conventioneers, business people on an expense account, etc will not find it expensive, buy I did.  Special occasion? A decent choice, although I prefer Durants for such an occasion.  A little better \"Price Value\" and this would be five-star.",

I'm not a kale fan, but the delivery of this side was perfect.  If you want to be super fancy, the booth with a  window view is $400 (minimum spending).

Just looking around you can see the nice views outside they had a piano player in the lounge area.    So this front lounge area you can have cocktails and appetizers or small plates they tell you everything with the black flooring is for that.  It's first come seating which makes it perfect if you want to come up and have a relaxed night out.    Then they walk you to the back you pass the reserved seating where you sit staring out the window into the view a couple private areas as well.   Keep in mind all these are a certain amount for minimum spending which it should be.    We keep walking back and we finally arrive at the dining seating where there's another bar you can actually sit and eat at.  The area is open, nice and perfect for a romantic night.  The chairs were comfy good size and the booths set up perfectly.    Since it was our first time here, the waitress went over everything with us and was very nice and sweet to us.    The drinks were made perfect especially the martinis.  I had a old fashion which they put a twist to     Now the food wow it all looked amazing but ended up on the elk and king salmon.   Man the first bite just sent me into la la land with the elk, seared perfect flavored perfect with the pepper crust and had a blueberry topping that for perfect with the elk.  Now the salmon was just as good flavored with a wasabi type aoli on top cooked to perfection.  Plus the pumpkin crusted shrimp for appetizer and half dozen oysters holy cow perfect flavor and best I've had in awhile.   We will be back especially for the seafood tower to try. Thanks for a great night here",

Big shout out to the executive chef, my friend is Vegan and the chef sent out a couple dishes for him as well as some appetizers for the rest of us that are not vegan. I was celebrating my birthday and they sent out a delicious dessert that accommodated all of us. The view of the city from the restaurant is breathtaking. This place is a must if you're in Phoenix or celebrating something special. The best part was at the end of the meal when I asked the server to have all the cooks come to my table so I could tip them all. Great job to the BOH team!",

We had never been before and were pleasantly surprised immediately after stepping off of the elevator. We opted for an earlier dinner to watch the sunset and we were not disappointed. The ambiance is incredible.  We ordered wine and a cheese board to start, along with their complimentary bread and custom spreads. The flavors were unique and we thoroughly enjoyed everything.  The service was impeccable from beginning to end. Our waitress had personality and an intimate knowledge of the menu. She had a great way of describing every dish we asked her to.   I ordered the beef tenderloin with a scallop and a shrimp, all of which were cooked beautifully. As a table, we ordered the carrots, risotto, and mashed potatoes. You guys, I never knew how freaking amazing vegetables could be made. We all kept stuffing our faces and mumbling words like \"amazing\", \"incredible\", and \"delicious\".   We ended the feast with a snickerdoodle bread pudding, sorbet, and a mousse crisp cake thing that they brought with the word \"congratulations\" written in chocolate in the plate. They have Peet's coffee, my favorite, so we enjoyed a bit of they a well.   Yes, it is expensive, but I feel like their offerings are unique and are prepared expertly enough that the price is justified. Not to mention the ambiance and impeccable service. I highly, highly recommend.",

A reservation was made far in advance as our group was large. I hadn't ever been so I needed all the help from concierge throughout the main level in the casino to direct me up to the 19th floor. I luckily made it in plenty of time before sunset... thus the name Orange Sky. We were graced with an absolutely stunning #SorbetSunset.  A smattering of fancy veggie plates and breads were ready for us as the hostesses led some of us early birds to our tables. The servers were ready to take our drink orders and they definitely kept them a flowing. We had a pre-selected menu and despite my server's recommendation of the beef, I went with salmon. Definitely no regrets picking that- probably one of the best filets I've ever eaten!   This would be a great place to dine to celebrate or have just a nice fancy meal out. I hope this can happen soon for me!",

We were only two so we chose the East facing windows.   We had the Agave Chile Beef Tenderloin which was amazing! The menu says it comes with sweet potato, avocado, and pumpkin seeds but it's only a slice of sweet potato, and one slice of avocado.   We then ordered the weekly dessert special which was a panno cotta with a fruit compote on top of a chocolate cake base. It was good, but nothing spectacular.  The view was great from any side which was the highlight of our visit. The bathroom was very impressive, most finishes were black but it had a clear view of the outside which brought in most of the light. Excellent design.  The service was okay. They became busy around 7 so that's when our service was not prompt anymore. We had to raise our hand if we wanted anything even a water refill or to order anything else. We also ordered the Butter Cake but it was stale so we requested them to take it back to the kitchen, which they did.",

    "text": "There have been few occasions where I have actually wanted to walk out on my meal. Congrats to Orange Sky. I came here for my 5th anniversary and sat in one of the beautiful private booths overlooking the most spectacular sunset. That's where the beauty stopped. It's now been three hours and I am still sitting here unattended to. The food? Nothing short of pedestrian and poorly executed at high prices. The service?  Simply absent. The bill? Incorrect. A few pointers I feel obligated to give the management: - When making the reservation and seating your guests, don't ask twice if we are celebrating something special if you don't plan on congratulating or mentioning it at dinner.  - White wine should be chilled, not set on the table. It does not need to \"open up\" like a red might so a full glass is not necessary.  - Medium rare steak should be medium rare throughout. Not well done to rare depending on where you cut.  - If your sole is fishy, it doesn't matter if you bake it and overwhelm it with ravioli, it still shouldn't be served.  - When sauce sits under the heat lamp for too long, it forms a film.  - If you don't have a qualified pastry chef on staff, don't offer dessert. A two-day old coffee cake with sorbet does not do the trick.   I think cooking is an art and as a former restaurant reviewer and proud home chef myself, I hate to leave a scathing review such as this. If it weren't for the sunset at Orange Sky, I would have left...which says more than words.",

Orange Sky will not be the closer alternative to Kai that I had hoped for.  The $125 per plate prix fixe meal included appetizer, salad, main, and dessert.  No wine pairing option was available, though the server did try to match glasses from their  limited by glass wine list.  There was no sommelier, and even the full bottle list was limited.  A \"complimentary\" glass of sparkling was definitely not a high quality.  Note to Orange Sky:  I would prefer glass of good sparkling poured halfway (normal), rather than a cheap sparkling poured to the rim.  The appetizers were both wonderfully plated.  My abalone was good, and my wife's lobster and risotto was excellent, but felt a little heavy on the cream for an appetizer.  Endive salads were simply average.  The standard lemon sorbet between salad and main was a large scoop in a small dish garnished with a mint leaf and berry.  It was awkward to eat with a spoon too large for the dish.  Main courses were both extremely well cooked lamb and beef, both a perfect medium rare.  Portions of meat were unusually large.  They were let down by the sides that neither paired well nor  were particularly well executed.  My poached pair dessert had a great flavor, but serving was not well thought out as it was difficult to eat.",

She was able to accommodate his request of a reservation for one of the private booths.  We get there on Saturday, waited less than 5 minutes to be seated.  We ordered drinks, our server Amy was so much fun and has a great personality.  We had the scallops and salmon, SO GOOD!  Amazing flavor, everything cooked just right.  We also had the green chile mashed potatoes, delicious!  The sweet potato was just as tasty.  We have been to other more expensive restaurants where the food has just been ok, but we felt that Orange Sky has very good pricing, great views, amazing food, very pleasant staff, and an awesome chef.  We asked about him, his name is Ron Dimas.  We would've loved to meet him, unfortunately the kitchen was extremely busy.  Can't wait to go back and try some of his other dishes.  Bravo Orange Sky!",

We arrived early but at the time of our reservation we were told, outer table would be ready in 15 minutes. Instead of apologizing she intimated it was our problem!

    "text": "I'm giving Orange Sky a solid four stars for a great experience. It's not my favorite restaurant in town, but it definitely one that impressed me beyond belief!   I visited Orange Sky months back when Talking Stick first opened and explored the restaurant sans guests, so I knew what I was walking into. However, I must say that it was even better the second time I went!   Time was running out to participate in Restaurant Week so we looked at the list of restaurants and decided that this was the perfect chance to try Orange Sky. Luckily we made reservations because when we arrived, they said that it was full until 9 PM (this was at 7). Upon arrival at the hostess stand at the bottom floor, I noticed that they have a really strict dress code: no t-shirts, cut-offs, flip flops, shorts, and some others that I can't remember. Once they checked our reservation, we got into the elevator and I was pleasantly surprised to see that one of the walls is glass, allowing us to look out on the desert as we zipped up. We arrived on the 15th floor and walked out into a lively lounge equipped with patios, plenty of seating and even a pianist singing classic tunes.   The restaurant itself is intimate and very much like a restaurant you would find in a large city. Glass windows line the restaurant and they have plenty of private seating. They have rooms to the right that seat roughly 15-20 people, including a wine rack room. To the left, they have private niches that seat between 4-6 people with windows looking out on the skyline. The main section of the restaurant has plenty of booths and tables as well as other tables along the windows. Then the rooftop patio has couch seating as well as regular tables. They even offer light-up menus since it's dark. The patio would be a wonderful place to sit and grab drinks and food and they even have a staircase that goes directly down into the club on the 14th floor.   Moving on to the food, it was pretty good. I started with the Artichoke bisque, followed by the game hen and ended the meal with a chocolate tarte. Everything was tasty. A couple things I noticed that stood out was when I asked our waitress what appetizer she suggested off of the prix fix menu, she said she didn't like one and hadn't tried the other and really did a pretty poor job of selling any of the items. I opted for the bisque without high expectations and it was a lot better then she sold it to be! Then for the wine, another waiter came by and asked us if we wanted refills on our cocktails. My bf opted for another beer and said so but I still had a half of glass of wine so didn't order another one. The second beer shows up and the next thing I know the waiter is pouring wine into my glass. I stopped him and said I didn't order a glass of wine and he said he thought he heard me say I did. I said I hadn't and at this point it was too late because the wine was already poured in. However, the waiter was very nice and since I hadn't asked for the wine, they didn't end up charging us for it.   In summary, I like Orange Sky and this is definitely a great option for date night, if you have visitors in town, or if you are staying at the casino. It's worth it to go for the ambiance alone.",

    "text": "The restaurant is located on the 15th floor of the towers at Talking Stick casino/resort/spa.  It was an unplanned visit, after the blackjack tables.    The entrance of the restaurant has dark wood floors and a jazz pianist with a singer to create a lounge feel.  I felt that the lounge needed more sofas and comfortable seating.  it seemed like an afterthought.    As you walk down the hallway, there are high backed sofas on your left that overlook - the parking lot???  These are by reservation only and require a $150 minimum on the weekends.  (Views of the parking lot at street level are free)  There are private dining rooms on the right side of the hallway which seat 6 and 16-18 respectfully.  The prices were appropriate for a large group, especially if you are sampling the wine.    The large dining room boasts a dual sided fireplace and sophisticated atmosphere.  There are several large booths along the outer edge and tables near the fireplace.  Service was excellent and as was the wine. I had a steak, truffled potatoes and seasonal squash and vegetables.  The steak was cooked medium rare and had a mushroom ragout sauce on the side.  It was satisfactory and the sauce added to the flavor.  Personally, I prefer my steak to stand on its own merits and not rely on the sauce.  The best side dish was the vegetables, which were sauteed in butter and a pinch of salt.    The outside patio is beautiful, with a small, central infinity pool and pillowed bench seating around it.  There are small tables and chairs, with some near the other side of the dual fireplace.  Again, this would be a fantastic place to see the sunset, if it were facing west and did not have views of the infamous parking lot.    This restaurant was very poorly planned with regards to layout.  It distracts you from the ok food but is saved somewhat by the quality of the wine.",

Looking out at the city lights while enjoying our perfectly prepared steaks. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because of the bar service. We checked in for our reservation and wanted to get a quick drink from the bar while they prepared our table. However this was far from quick. Sarah, the bartender proceeded to ignore us for 10 minutes. There were only 8 people in the bar area.  Finally after 10 minutes we were greeted. Then another 5 minutes go by before we are asked what we would like. And finally after 20 minutes we had drinks in our hands. This is no exaggeration, we checked in 10 minutes before our reservation time and didn't get seated until 10 minutes after. I expected a lot better service from the bar staff in an establishment like this. So if you see the blonde younger girl Sarah at the bar be prepared.",

The crab, however, was spectacular. They crack it all for you and bring you only the meat.  I would definitely eat here again.",

We requested a table to watch the sunset and what a beautiful sunset we had!  we were seated promptly and our server was very nice and gave us excellent service. I ordered the beet salad and is so good and the salmon which was cooked perfectly. My husband and daughter split the ribeye as it is 17 oz and it was delicious just as the previous time. The selections of wine are ample and they make great martinis.  After they cleared our table, our waiter came with a beautiful Birthday chocolate little cake, with \"Happy Birthday\"  written on the plate, that was a very nice touch. I recommend this restaurant to anybody wanting to have good service, good food and an amazing sunset!",

    "text": "This review relates primarily to a group function.  The restaurant is terrific, but other reviews might be better guides for a typical night out. Recently, Our company asked for ideas to mark 20 years in business, on which the staff then voted.  The winning idea was a spring training game followed by dinner.  That led us to the Salt River Fields and the Talking Stick Resort.  I had dined at Orange Sky (the resort's fine dining option) several times so I ended up volunteering to help with the dinner arrangements. I contacted Orange Sky and was directed to Cameo Wall, a very professional and accommodative event coordinator.  She gave us options, like a private party room, fixed menus, etc.  All communications were clear and included full details including both per person costs and total costs. Our group numbered about 45 people so Cameo requested that we work with a restricted menu.  Not a problem for us as we opted for Scallops, Salmon, Chicken and Filet options.  We polled our group to make sure we had the bases covered and the feedback was positive.  In the end, it looked like almost everyone opted for the massive 12 oz. filet.  My point here is I would not sweat too much over the number of options - a fish and a beef option would have worked fine. The 5-star rating is not so much for the atmosphere, although the view is terrific.  It is also not in particular about the food - which also was top notch.  It is purely a comment on the ease of process created by Cameo, who handled all matters with great care and delivered exactly as promised.  After this experience I would feel comfortable giving Cameo our requirements and allowing her to craft the event from beginning to end.   Only one tip needed for anyone thinking about a dining event - the 12 oz. filet made quite the impression on our staff.  We wanted them to feel pampered and out of everything we did, from open bar to rooms for the night, the filet was the standout in post party conversations.  I only comment because the standard catered menu included twin 4 oz. tournedos of beef - spend a bit extra and you will get bang for the buck.",

We started with Fois Gras that was fairly bland and then moved on to a Caesar salad that was equally bland and had croutons that were too hard to eat.  For our main course I had a veal chop and my husband had lamb chops.  Again, bland and the lamb was heavily coated with fat.  Perhaps we hit them on an off night, but for the money we will not be going back.",

    "text": "We went to Orange Sky for our 34th wedding anniversary dinner.  We picked Orange Sky in part because of the great view of the sunset.  Unfortunately, it was a rare cloudy/rainy evening in Scottsdale.  We started the evening in the lounge, which was very nice.  Windows all around and plenty of comfortable, intimate seating.  Drinks are expensive with mixed drinks around $15 and bottle of beer around $6.  The mixed drinks were very good though and a reasonable size.  You are required to close out your lounge bill before going to dinner, so I don't believe your lounge bill will not count toward the private dining booth minimum.  I should also add that the live jazz trio in the lounge sounded very good and provided nice background music, not too loud.  We then moved into the main dining room, which is nice with windows all around and a beautiful outdoor area, which you can visit during your meal.  Overall the room was very nice, the tables were seated a nice distance apart so it didn't feel crowded at all.  We had a birthday party of about 25 people seated next to us and we could still reasonably hear each other.  The room did get somewhat uncomfortably warm during the evening, which detracted from the enjoyment of the evening.  Service during the evening was very good, but not flawless.  Our primary waiter was very nice and provided answers to our questions about the food.  Our water was kept full without asking.  We did have to slice up our shared appetizer and pour our own wine refills.  And when the food arrived it was a bit awkward placing all the dishes on the table.  the food was the highlight of the evening.  We had two different entrees - wild boar ($34) and skirt steak ($29).  Both were outstanding - flavorful and just as described by our waiter.  I had a good sized portion of the wild boar, probably close to 10 ounces, which was tender and served with gnocci. We had three sides, the cauliflower gratin, the sweet potatoes, and the crushed potatoes.  These were all good but not great, but were definitely enough for two as stated in the menu, and were around $10 each.  Complimentary bread was also served with meal, which was good but just two types of simple bread.  We had a bottle of wine with dinner, Fess Parker 2014 Syrah, which was very good and reasonably priced at $45.  We did not order dessert, were given a small complimentary dessert in honor of our anniversary, which was very nice.  I believe our total bill including pre-dinner drinks, wine, appetizer, 3 entrees and 3 sides was around $300 including tax and tip.  Overall, it was a very nice evening and I would defintely return to Orange Sky for a special dinner.",

You walk down a hallway that is lined with wine rooms and sommelier quarters and flanked by private booths with stunning views.  It opens to a huge white tablecloth dining room with incredible 180 degree views.  They absolutely have that right.  I had the braised porkshank.  It was very good.  It was not amazing and it was not the best that I have ever had but it was very good.  One member of our party had the lamb.  He said that it was just ok.  It looked great and the presentation was really executed well.  The other had a filet.  I am not a fan of filet but that being said it was still very good.  He also said that he enjoyed it.  I have to say that it was prepared perfectly.  I di did not try it but the quinoa was raved about by the others at the table.  I think they have it right.  A beautiful dining room.  Really good food...not the best...  Prices were reasonable for the quality and experience.  I was there on business and would return on my next trip.  Not being from the area, if someone else had a suggestion that they thought would be better I would pass on orange sky and try that new place.",

    "text": "I'm not the type to complain or be vocal about bad experiences, but I really feel the need to write a review after my very negative experience at Orange Sky last night.   It was early Sunday afternoon and I had called 3 times to make a reservation for the restaurant after hearing great things about it. The first two times my call went directly to a voicemail asking me to leave a message with my desired reservation time and that someone would get back to me. As I was uninterested in leaving a message, I called back again and my call was answered by someone. I made a reservation for two people at 7:45pm that night (Sunday) and we planned on arriving a few minutes early to grab a cocktail in the lounge while the sun was setting.   We arrived quite early (around 6:45pm) and let the hostess know that we were there and would grab a drink while waiting for our table. We mentioned that we'd love to be seated early, if possible, and we were told that \"it should be about that time\" (7:45pm) when our table would be ready. We understood, since it was Arizona Restaurant Week and we assumed the restaurant was incredibly busy (you aren't able to see the restaurant from the lounge area, so we couldn't tell).   We went to grab a drink at the bar and unfortunately, the bartender either was not behind the bar or had his back to us. After about 15 minutes, we were able to get a drink and have a seat. We relaxed for quite some time and later learned that it was the bartender's first night - understandable, but should have a bit more training as to not ignore customers when there are only about 4 people sitting at the bar. We went to sit outside on a small balcony right off the lounge.  At around 7:40pm, we started to get antsy and went inside to check on our spot and let them know that we had been on the balcony in case they missed us. We told them \"we were out on the patio and just wanted to make sure you knew we hadn't left\" since no one had said a word to us since we had been there. The hostess' response was, \"We're waiting on our servers to catch up. You'd like to sit on the patio?\" We replied, \"We'd be happy to sit on the restaurant patio, however, we'd like to be seated inside or out - whichever was first available.\" She replied, \"Oh. I'll keep that in mind.\"  We were confused as to what just happened and thanked her although we felt she was giving us an attitude and sat back down.   At 8:15pm, when we still had not been seated or even approached by the hostess even though our reservation had been 30-minutes prior, we debated just leaving. We agreed that we'd give it 2 more minutes and we would cancel our reservation and head somewhere we knew we'd get good service. Just a moment after that, someone came up to us to tell us that our table was ready. However, we didn't receive an apology or anything. We definitely expected more from a restaurant that was so highly rated.  We were then walked back, through the velvet roped entrance, to the dining room. I must say, the space is absolutely gorgeous. Definitely a winner in the ambiance department. However, we were absolutely stunned when we arrived in the dining room and it was quite empty. There weren't many seated tables at all - which made us disappointed that we waited so long to be seated.... definitely a sign that they were understaffed.  We were seated at a booth inside, and waited for our server. And waited. After about 15 minutes of waiting, our server finally came by to get our drinks. We had decided to take part in the Restaurant Week Menu and were asked to put our entire order - drinks, meal and dessert - in all at once. We obliged, and waited. We weren't served our first course until 9:15pm.   When it arrived, we were definitely underwhelmed. The salmon was over-seasoned and overcooked. The soup was marginal, and the potatoes were hard. One thing that was great was the steak - although it was very small, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. Unfortunately, our server didn't come back at all throughout our meal to check on us until we were just about through and she swooped our plate away from us without asking if we were finished.   Also, the women's restroom was dirty and there were paper towels all over the floor. Definitely not something I expected.   For spending over $160 on the meal and drinks for two, the service was unacceptable and the food was just okay. Overall, the experience we had was only a 2 out of 5. And it would be a 1 if the ambiance and view weren't as good.   I hate writing negative reviews, but Orange Sky should make an effort to work on their customer service. Once that is fixed, I'm sure it will be a great spot for a special occasion.",

    "text": "Visited this restaurant with my wife for our anniversary based on a suggestion from someone (and confirmed that it was a decent choice via Yelp).  So, to start it's at Talking Stick Resort and it's on the 15th (top?) floor of the hotel.  The restaurant is the entire floor with the entrance area featuring a bar/lounge with live music for while you wait, you can also sit on one of the many balconies and enjoy the views.  Most of the seating wraps around the perimeter of the restaurant with floor to ceiling windows to enjoy the view.  Group seating and private groups are toward the middle.  We made 8:30 reservations and were seated by 8:40.  Our servers (yes two) were fairly prompt and attentive.  The main one that took our order had many suggestions and was able to answer any questions we had.  Ordered a Mojito cocktail.  Was decent, but a tad on the small side and light in the Alcohol.    We ordered the Lobser Bisque  which they placed into 2 bowls for us.  It was excellent.  We had been told that all the entries were large enough to share.  We got the pork chop which was delicious and plenty large enough to share.  All meals come with a choice of sauce, but based on the recommendation from the waiter, we skipped it which was an excellent suggestion.  The pork had plenty of flavor by itself and was very juicy.  We ordered the \"whipped potatoes\" as the side and those were large enough to be their own meal.  The sleeper hit was the dessert.  we ordered the chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce and raspberry  pop-rocks, yes the kids candy, pop-rocks.  It  was unbelievable!  Overall, very pleased.  Not an every-week type of place to visit, but definitely for special occasions.  Total seating time was about 90 minutes and bill was about $85 with drink and tip.    Tips: Reservation highly recommended (their reservation line is a voice mail box, left a message and they called back within an hour), request one of the private booths, and they do have a dress code (collared shirt, no ripped jeans).",

    "text": "Great atmosphere, amazing food.  The only problem I ran into was the fact that I went for my 35th birthday and had recently gone to the DMV to get my photo retaken (AZ requires this every 12 years).  So they put a hole punch in my license and then gave me a paper copy.  Well, I changed to my purse to a fancier one and took out my drivers license, debit/credit card and a few other things because my purse was so small.  I, however, forgot to put the paper copy of my new license in my purse.  So when I went to order a glass of wine and handed my waiter my ID, it was hole punched.  He went to talk to the manager and bottom line they refused to serve me.  Yes.  This was my fault (even though I thought this was REALLY lame as I was there with my FAMILY and not friends).  The part that REALLY irritated me was that the manager should have come over to talk to me about it instead of leaving it to the waiter. Furthermore, not everyone at the table was carded so if he would not have asked to see MY ID it wouldn't have been an issue.  And again, I get it.  It was my fault and they were just following the laws.  But it was a huge buzz kill for the evening and fair or not, left a sour taste in my mouth.  On the bright side, I probably saved 300 calories and $25!!!!",

We called Orange Sky Saturday at 4 and left a voice mail requesting a reservation that night between 7:30-8. Orange Sky opened at 5. Nobody ever called to confirm or deny availability. I called at 7 to check status. Spoke with Mirandee (sp?). She indicated they were full until 9. I asked why I hadn't been called. She stated that she was just now getting around to the voicemails. Makes no sense to me. No apologies. My review is based off their lack off customer service since we never made it in the door to taste their food.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here for a pre vday dinner. It was the first time being here for both of us and we were excited to see what all the fuss was about. Our dinner reservation was for 930pm so we called at 8 to see if they could possibly fit is in sooner. They lady said \"yes come in and we will seat you as soon as possible\" and informed us we could hang out in the lounge. So we came in and waited...and waited...and waited. 9pm came around, we were still waiting. Given that our reservation wasn't until 930, i remained patient. 930 comes around, then 945... This whole time watching people come in and get seated right away or soon after arriving. Finally at 10:10pm they finally came over and said they were ready for us. We were pretty much the last to be seated even with arriving an hour and half before our reservation!!! By this point I didn't even want to eat there anymore but we waited that long, my as well try it out. Going in I was expected to see room full of people which would make the long wait acceptable. Instead the room was half empty.. And to top it off we were seated in the middle of the room with little privacy, even though they had open seats next to the windows with beautiful views. Our view was the couple in the booth in front of our table making out and taking selfie after selfie. The only good thing I can say about whole thing was the food. The food was really good. I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the rib eye steak which both were cooked perfectly. This however, did not make up for the complete lack of service from the hosts. Needless to say I will not be going here again nor will I recommend this restaurant to anyone. Such a disappointment.",

    "text": "Terrible, worst piece of meat ever, save your money. All this restaurant has to offer is a view.  Pre drinks: Bartender was dense, unprofessional, and unapologetic when questioned. He was obviously unhappy with his career choice as a mixologist.    Dinner: We were seated 40 minutes after our reservation. Seated at a table that was set for three when our party was four. We waited awkwardly for our lackluster team of servers to dig up a chair and table setting. Three of us ordered ribeye. One steak was undercooked, one overcooked, and one was just right. I was lucky enough to be delivered the Goldilocks steak. Shame on you chef for your uninspired preparation of such a wonderful cut of meat, the cow herself should feel disrespected. In an effort to self-season with salt and pepper I found none on our table. With no waiter in site I helped myself to the salt and pepper from the empty uncleared table next to us. Potatoes and cauliflower were dry and had the appearance and texture of food fresh from a microwave.  Our wine was wonderful. Our server managed to successfully opened it and poured it flawlessly. This was the high point of our meal and I'm proud of him. No dessert or coffee.   Be prepared for mediocrity, both service and food. You're paying for the view.",

The hostess was late seating us for the sunset dinner we planned, then we did not receive the correct booth as requested and reserved.  They moved us to a booth with  no view!  The manager and the server did make up for the rudeness and the mishap but enough to make us come back.  The food was good but very overpriced.  We were very disappointed, the managerial team seemed very unorganized. I hope they improve these areas.",

We did make a reservation ahead of time in order to make sure we got a table (the restaurant was super busy when we came). We ordered the cheese board and calamari to start with for appetizers. Super delish! and they also give you bread and butter to snack on. My meal of choice was a the veal chop and it was cooked perfectly! I shared the smashed potato side with my friend and the artichokes that came with is was amazing. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a classy dinner.",

View is amazing (really, figure out when the sunset is and make your reservation accordingly). Service was spot on (knew the menu but didn't push things). Food was amazing from the starters to the steaks,  scallops,  and shrimp. Dessert was very original. Had drinks at the bar on the top floor with good live music (why is this hard to find in Phoenix without it being head banging music?)   All in all a wonderful experience.",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. We usually go to Mastro's or Durant's and I wanted to try something different. We arrived at 4:55 p.m. and noticed a crowd of people waiting. Apparently, they do not open the elevators to the restaurant until 5 p.m. Once we got to the restaurant we told the host, we have a 5 p.m. reservation. The host said she would get us when they were ready. So, what's the point in making a reservation? At 5:10 p.m. they seated us. The booth was a nice couch with pillows, curtains for privacy and a view. Unfortunately, we weren't able to see the sunset. But, we did have a good view of Top Golf. I had the Honey Poached Pear Salad, which was delicious. My boyfriend had the class Caesar Salad, which was just OK. He had the 12 ounce beef tenderloin. We thought it was tender and tasty. I had the 8 ounce Tajima Wagyu Striploin. I wish I had ordered something different. It was tough and lacked flavor. I've had Kobe beef before and it was delicious. This was terrible and even worse was the price of $60. Also, we both had the King Crab Merus (3 ounces), which was good but pricey. For the sides, we got the Cauliflower Aged Cheddar Gratin and it was bland. I couldn't taste any cheddar, it was just like watered down cauliflower. The Green Chile Whipped Potatoes were good. The server gave me a tiny slice of flourless chocolate cake for my birthday. It was so rich that we could only take one bite. For dessert, we ordered the cheesecake and cobbler with ice cream. I thought the dessert was good, but nothing like the desserts from Durant's! Overall, I'd say save your money and go somewhere else. The positives: server and private booth. The negatives: food wasn't worth the price and view wasn't great. If you're going to spend $250 (not including tip) on a meal and one cocktail, I think it should be one of the best meals of your life!",

The atmosphere is upscale but warm not to stiff, I enjoyed the food as well. I had a shredded asparagus salad and my date had a new york strip and all was amazing.. the view from the restaurant is beautiful . If I could make any suggestions it would only be to add more variety to the salads on the menu I only seen two salad options. Im not a meat or seafood hater but I do enjoy a fresh salad. I will definitely come back and recommend to others",

She recommended some great suggestions and was very attentive. So attentive that a table of four cost us $500. We ended the meal for the four of us with great desserts and coffee. Once we were done my friend said have you ever seen the outside patio. I said no and he said well check it out. We got out of our private booth and were heading done to the patio when all of a sudden an obnoxious staff member named Octovia stopped us and said where are you going? And then said normally we don't allow people to go down this area and you have to be quiet and I will make this exception. When you send $500 on a meal and want to walk to a public patio on the same floor, that is not how to approach a patron, especially when they just had a great evening. And to make his even better of a story, I asked for the managers name and got Nicks card. But wanted to make sure I got the correct persons name. So when we took the elevator done to the main floor, Octovia was there. And I told her how rude she was. She didn't care and then I said I will be sure to let Nick know. And she just walked away and said do that. Octavia might need to get some customer service skills because I will let Nick know.",

The food was excellent as well!  We didn't care for the snotty waitress or manager.  My wife, sister, brother in law, and myself all went here for a late dinner.  We are all in our early to mid thirties.  They asked for our ID's at the table for drinks (no issue).  However, I didn't like that the waitress took our ID's away from the table and into the back bar area.  I asked her to come back with them, and she explained it was policy so I asked to speak to her manager, who basically rolled her eyes at me.  From that point forward, our service definitely suffered.  I wasn't trying to be a pain in the @ss, I just don't feel it is appropriate to take all our personal information away from the table where we can't see them.  It wasn't like we were questionable in age.",

Excellent service from attentive and knowledgeable staff, with several delectable food options that were pleasing to the palate. Surprisingly, only one beer choice that wasn't just another tasteless nationwide-brand lager. While the food was legitimately delicious, my experience never recovered from seeing fois gras on the menu, because I know the cruelty geese must experience to produce this. If patrons saw how their choice of fois gras caused a goose to have a large steel pipe constantly forced deep down their throats, I doubt they would enjoy the rest of their dining experience either.",

You can't beat it! We found the appetizers to be great. Cheeseboard was great. He loved the soup.  Average bread. We both decided to have steaks and I'm sorry we didn't try something else. My husband had the ribeye and it was quite chewy. I had the market price Japanese steak. I honestly thought it was an average steak I couldn't even say that it was great in anyway. That steak cost me $60. I got caught up in the pitch of it being like Kobe beef. It was nowhere near Kobe beef. We told our waiter that my husband's steak I was chewy- nothing was done about that as far as they will throw in a dessert or discount the meal a little. We didn't even tell him how I felt about my steak. I didn't want to be that complaining customer that's not happy. We will give it a try again because the appetizers were great the views are great and the service is great! Oh and they did bring me a Happy Retirement complimentary dessert! Very yummy!",

    "text": "Wow - what a fantastic view of the entire city. This restaurant is on the 15th floor of the Talking Stick Casino and Resort. I've never seen a layout quite like this before.   You go up the elevator to the 15th floor, the door opens to a very spacious bar and floor to ceiling windows facing west (perfect for a sunset dinner). They held our reservation with delight (although we were a little late) while we enjoyed a cocktail and live music in the bar area.   Once we entered the dining room I knew this place was unique. There are HUGE captain sofa's facing west with unobstructed views of the entire city. I can only explain this ambiance by saying, you literally have your own living room while you eat. The staff was more than accommodating, 2 waiters to each table. Although that seems like too much, they balanced it out perfectly so we weren't annoyed at all. Actually my date and I ended up having a great conversation with Jeff, a server from Duluth Minnesota (where my family is from)   Prices are comparable to Mastro's although I did only give 4 stars because my steak was a little too done. But it was still really good.   Then I went down to the casino and lost $100 bucks - bummer! LOL!  When Spring Training starts I bet this place will go OFF! There are several banquet rooms that looked really fun for parties of 12.",

Maggie provided excellent, knowledgable service. One waitstaff came between us and the sunsetting view which contributed to my less than perfect rating. Our group was generally pleased with the food but my bacon wrapped scallop/shrimps were a bit over done. On three previous visits the food seemed more exceptional; not sure if they have changed or if my expectations have changed. Anyway, the view at Orange Sky is consistently a perfect 10!",

I'm not convinced the food is worth the prices they charge but what the food lacks is definitely made up for by the beautiful surroundings. Having said that, I would certainly go back to enjoy drinks and apps in the lounge and relish in the atmosphere and listen to the live music. Would probably skip out on dinner though unless someone else was footing the bill. They have live music seven nights a week in the lounge but the guy who performs on Tuesdays really blew me away. Acoustic guitar combined with a superb voice. His version of Piano Man on the guitar was exceptional.   As others mentioned, you have to walk through the smoke filled, noisy \"ching ching ching ching\"  casino to get to the Orange Sky elevators but once you're up there you forget about all the casino happenings below you. And, the resort should really do a better job marketing this great spot. It doesn't even mention on their site that they have live music and to me that was the highlight. One more thing, I would probably wait a few (or more) months before going as they are still in construction clean-up mode surrounding the resort. Once the desert is free of construction debris and returned to it's natural desert habitat the views will be even better.",

I had the oysters and the fillet (with the compound butter sauce), both which were excellent.   Unfortunately, it took some time for my dinner to come out of the kitchen despite the fact that the restaurant was not all that busy. This made a quick bite turn in to a multi-hour affair. Additionally, it was disappointing that you are exiled to the no-view back bar if you want to have an entree at a bar.   Otherwise, I had a great time. I would recommend reserving a west facing table around sunset if you're looking for a great romantic setting.",

The waiter was experienced and knowledgeable. He gave some good advice. The assistant waiter was attentive. The wine list was the same with decent value among overpriced selections. The vodka martinis are great. The ribeye steaks were excellent: not best in the valley but good quality for price. The desserts were decent quality though a little high priced. The sides sounded better than they were in real life. We had five at our table of four and none tasted good. The salads were a disaster: ingredients tired and dressing not right. This was our fourth visit but the first time we felt we had a poor, overpriced meal. I know they can do better so can't understand what happened.",

My wife had the crab legs that were already de-shelled, that rocked!

We enjoy the ambiance the decor and atmosphere and of course, the great food!!! Tonight was no different. I ordered the New York strip with the red wine reduction sauce, and my girlfriend had the alaskan king crab legs. Everything was delicious as always!! We had a great server too, his name was Bradford. Very warm and gracious and very attentive when my girlfriend requested a wine that was she was not able to find on the menu, he took the time to look over the menu and was able to find the wine we requested by her just explaining what the bottle label looked like. It really showed how committed he was to ensure that we got what we wanted. He was very knowledgable about the  menu and really had a grasp of the assortment of cheeses on our artisan cheese board. Very impressed.  We will certainly be requesting Bradford again next time we dine at the Orange Sky.  The only reason we did not give 5 stars is that we were not seated till about 35 minutes after our reservation time. (but again, it was a crazy valentines evening) one of the busiest dining out nights. And the other although has nothing to do with the restaurant, but again still apart of the total experience of Talking Stick Resort, the valet attendant (short overweight guy with a beard) was very snooty and disrespectful. But hey you can win it all. Overall I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant and our server Bradford.",

The lighting is super dark & sexy, which makes for blah photos, but amazing in-the-moment vibes. So, prepare to be impressed! Also, request a spot out on the patio... you'll feel like you're on a luxurious vacation somewhere far far away from Phoenix. Very classy.   Food-wise, also very impressed. I expected glorified casino buffet food, but Orange Sky was truly gourmet. Steaks were cooked expertly, veggie sides were unique and seasonal, and the prices were actually not that bad. Mains were $25-40, and the wine list is long with plenty of affordable bottles.   We sat outside on the covered patio, but the inside area is huge if you prefer staying out of that glorious dry Arizona air. There are even private seating nooks, for an extra intimate date night.   I was nervous about Orange Sky being too wannabe-classy, too pricey, or just lacking character, but I was completely proven wrong. Definitely recommended to impress yourself, a date, or a large group!",

It came out to about $100 per person and we didn't even drink alcohol. Great for a vacation visit.",

We were promptly greeted and sat, which was great. Once our waitress greeted us we were oh so foolish to order a drink, my wife and I were carded. Although, I'm not sure how many underage kids are trying to order $20 cocktails from a fine dining establishment.   The waitress took the id's for the greater part of 20 minutes and came back to inform us my wife's id had just expired. Instead of asking for another form of id she disappeared until I had the audacity to ask the manager if there was a problem. The manager proceeded to blame that policy on the Indian reservation and casino policy. My wife is 33 years old, she would've gladly produced a current id if that was requested. Instead they decided to have my wife work with her expired id and sign a waiver. This was a bit embarrassing and to me is unacceptable for a place that is going to charge essentially $100 a head. All of this followed by bringing me out the wrong drink.   My wife did love her scallops, my steak was maybe a little over cooked but it tasted alright.",

    "text": "Here's the headline: Ask for Julio to be your server if you want a phenomenal dining experience. Julio made dinner even more awesome. From the moment he came to our table to introduce himself, we knew we were going to have an amazing night.  Now, the rest of my review.  The location of Orange Sky is awesome. The view of the valley of the sun from the perch atop the Talking Stick Resort is spectacular. To avoid walking through the smoke filled casino, try to park on the north side of the resort, not the side that faces Talking Stick Way. You will shave a 10 minute walk through the mindless, hypnotized gambling people.   For special date nights, i'd recommend making reservations for one of the private sweetheart tables. The atmosphere is super romantic the view is as mentioned above and you have total privacy while you dine. There is a $200 meal minimum, easily met if you order appetizers, drinks, bottle of wine, etc.  Let's talk about the food. Was it good? Yes. Was it great? No. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give the food an eight or nine. Have I had better steaks? Yes. Have I had better side dishes? Sure. But, food is very subjective. The food was high-quality, tasty, prepared perfectly, and exactly what you would expect from a high-quality, high-end restaurant.   We started with a prickly pear, crusted, shrimp for an appetizer or. My wife ordered some exotic margarita and I ordered an old fashion.   She ordered some market price cut of beef that I had never heard of, nor can I pronounce. It came out rare as she ordered it, it was tender as can be without being Kobe beef. I got a perfectly cooked ribeye. We shared the sweet potato and goat cheese side dish with maple bourbon. We also had a great bottle of Pinot Noir from New Zealand. We finished it off with a lemon curd cheesecake and two French pressed coffee's. Our dinner came out to $207 and was worth every bit of it. We tipped Julio on the bill total and rounded it up to 25% as he alone increased the enjoyment of our dinner immensely.   What makes the experience at Orange Sky is a combination of all of the above elements. When you start with the sweetheart table, and Julio as your server, order a terrific meal with good wine, you can't go wrong.",

    "text": "My inlaws love hitting the slots so as a result of having spent way too much time here and having lots of extra credits, I got a free meal and I couldn't have been more excited. I had been wanting to come here for a long time. We arrived early and sat at the bar and ordered a couple of cocktails. I got a glass of wine and my husband got a beer. The wine list is pretty impressive and not horribly priced. The had live music playing in the lounge which was really good. I was very surpised at the quality of the music. If I were braver I would have gotten up and danced.   Eventually we were lead back to back to the main dining room and I was floored by the view. Very nice! We were seated by the window facing west which I had read ahead of time was the place to be for the best view. The reviews were right, it was beautiful. If i were just here for drinks and the view I would definitely be giving this a five star review. Unfortunatelly the rest of the experience was less than impressive.   When our waitress came over we asked her what she recommended for appetizers, of course she recommended the $80 oyester and clam plate. Her next recommendation were the two next most expensive items on the menu paired together. Really? I hate it when you can tell a server is trying to up their payout. Maybe she really did like those items, but she could have at lease sold them better. Her attitude was very cold and felt like she had much better places to be than waiting on us. We did get one of her recommendations, the anitpasto platter. It was good but i've had better. No one at my table seemed to like it besides me. Since it was a Spanish themed tapas platter, I think the ingredients were a little to exotic for the small town midwesterners I was eating with.   We then ordered our dinner. I had the strip steak with the farro corn pesto salad. It was very good. Very well cooked and the flavors of the salad worked really well with each other. When I asked my dining companions if they enjoyed their meals, they all seemed to think their food was good, but i think when you see the caliber of the restaurant you just expect more. Something to wow you. We were never wowed.   I've seen other people mention this and they're right, if you're eating a 3 course meal expect about a 3 hour dining experience. I'm not saying this is bad, it's actually nice to sit amd just enjoy the views all night.   From what I saw there's only one bathroom for both men and women. For a fairly large restaurant, this is surprising.  having to wait for a restroom after spending so much on a meal seems ridiculous. While waiting for the women's to open I saw a man and women walk out of one together. Seeing that just summed up my entire dining experience.   This restaurant definitely sucks you in for the views which are great, but they definitely stop trying there. They know they'll keep people comimg for the views so no need to impress them with service and food.",

Large spread out dining areas, special rooms, bar area and outdoor seating are all available. Amazing views are the big draw at Orange Sky. Service was exceptional with a well trained staff that is knowledgeable and friendly. The menu isn't the largest but there are ample choices to please land and seafood lovers alike. The wine list is fairly extensive and reasonably priced so we had a bottle of one of our favorites to accompany our superb meal. Desserts were also sampled and were right up to par with the rest of the meal. We have stayed at this resort several times and we have always found it to be very nice but never dined at Orange Sky. Now we have another great choice in restaurants too. We will return!",

    "text": "Our waiter, Will, was terrific. He provided an overview of the menu and answered all of our questions. He was very personable and was very attentive to our needs throughout our meal.   The restaurant atmosphere was superb and the view was great from almost any place you sat. One thing we didn't know was that there were seats behind a curtain along the wall on the left as you were shown to your seats in the main dining room. Those seats provided a great view of the distant horizon. But, the seats came at a cost of $200 just for the view. If you want romance, the seats are well worth the extra cost.  My wife ordered Sauteed Foie Gras and I had a Green Salad. The Foie Gras looked delicious, but my Duncan Farm Field Salad had a lot to be desired. I definitely would not order the salad again.  My wife ordered the Diver Scallops and I ordered the Skuna Bay Salmon. As a side, we shared the Crushed Potatoes with Sherry Vinegar, Pancetta and Parmesan. The side was okay except it was overpowered by the vinegar. The Diver Scallops were delicious and my cedar-blanked Salmon was okay. It wasn't prepared with a bourbon hickory sauce, but it did come with a raspberry chutney, which I enjoyed.  I forgot to mention, we had a Sweet Muddled Southern Comfort to start our meal, but found the drink was short on Southern Comfort. We asked to have the drink strengthened and found out later that we were charged for the extra shots.   As I said earlier, our waiter did a great job, but I found the food lacking. I don't think I will be trying the restaurant right away again. For the price, the meal should have been a lot better.  Janet & Roger Race",

Minimalist decor, super, super spacious, many options including semi private couch seating for couples - all with incredible views of Scottsdale and sorrounding mountains....  Caesar salad 2/5 (it was the only food on the menu I did not care for as it had bacon and other non-traditional ingredients I did not like)  12 oz Filet 5/5 (medium rare plus)  Side order of mushrooms and cauliflour 5/5  Bread 4/5  Drinks 4+/5 (I only tried the original margarita) you can have whatever you like as most bars, but their list is comprised of traditional styled drinks (preparation the way they were originally conceived...)  Chocolate Dessert 5/5, special root beer dessert weak 2/5  Service 5/5  Pricing is fair and comparable to most upscale steak houses.   Bottom line...if you want the best steakhouse in Phoenix, maybe the camelback inn's BLT steak is still the best for steak (bone-in filet), an Ocean Club at Kierland (if you want more of a people watching, live music & open restaurant feel) But dont discard orange sky if you are looking for incredible views, in a super chic setting, with pretty good food and service.",

We pre-ordered our wine and hor d'oeuvres and had a private server.  The restaurant allowed us to decorate our area in advance and we even had a small private balcony.  The bar and dance floor were just steps away and the band was a lot of fun.  Between eating perfectly spiced crab cakes and tuna tartar we packed the dance floor.   We have enjoyed dinner here in the past but this was the first event we experienced here.  I can tell you it won't be the last.

    "text": "The most disappointing dinner at a fine dining restaurant that I've ever had....EVER.  Where to begin...we were a party of 6 celebrating our son's first job after graduating from college.  We wanted a special restaurant and had heard great things about Orange Sky.  We arrived for our 7:45 reservation and were seated in the main dining room next to a party of 75-100 people who were enjoying their business dinner.  It was so loud, I couldn't believe that that the restaurant would not have made an effort to seat us somewhere else as it was a Sunday evening and aside from the huge, loud party there were few other guests.  We were there about 20 minutes when the manager came over and apologized for the noise.  She said they should be done pretty soon (no offer to move us, or buy us a cocktail or dessert).  Our waiter was polite, not super attentive.  Food was ok.  My scallops were cold in the middle.  Mashed potatoes were warm, not hot.  Some of the asparagus was tough. My son's GF had salmon which she took 2 bites of yet the waiter never asked if it was ok.  The assistant wait staff was shocking. We had ordered sides for the table and when they didn't all fit, they just stacked on top of each other (on the rims of the plates. I couldn't believe that in such an upscale restaurant how poorly trained they seemed.  Dessert was meh.  We spent $800 for this dismal experience.  I doubt Orange Sky reads these reviews, but they really should.  If I had known how bad this experience would be, we would have gone to Kai or Elements. Lots of great choices in the valley...Orange Sky is not one of them.",

The combination of sweet, spicy, and savory on the lamb chops with an ancho honey glaze is divine, and the lamb is good so well--juicy and tender.  The Jidori chicken is tender and flavorful, and it is a large portion of protein (but definitely order a side to complement it!).  The Chilean sea bass has always come out perfectly cooked and is light, flavorful, and really quite a large portion for a sea bass entree!  For sides, the roasted sweet potatoes are nice if you want a taste of fall.  The green chile whipped potatoes have a nice depth of flavor, and it is a nice take on classic mashed potatoes -- this is one of our go-tos when we dine in.  The only disappointment I've had here is with the gnocchi side, which is very, very small in portion--it is the type of dish where you can easily count how many are on the plate. The few on the plate were delicious, at least!  It is at odds with the other sides, which are easily shareable.",

Plate #1: Rib-eye steak - worst steak he has have ever eaten. There was an extreme amount of tasteless fat and appeared to be lower quality beef. The seasoning could not mask the underwhelming flavor of the meat.   Enhancement: shrimp and Scallop steak - very good. Wish we got only the starter and a few of these.   Plate #2: New York Strp: More tasteful than the rib-eye but only slightly. Again, lacked flavor and had terrible presentation. Served on a huge plate with NOTHING else on the dish. Just the pure sight of the dish had us both saying \"something is missing\"   Accompaniments: asparagus, garlic butter, lemon zest. Again, very disappointed. Lacked flavor and did not taste fresh.   The server also never asked how the meal was or if we needed anything else (other than drinks)  Lastly, when I called to confirm the reservation, the staff asked if we were celebrating anything special. I let them know we were celebrating a major work promotion (plenty of other yelp reviews had mentioned how the restaurant did little extra things for their celebrations). They did nothing for us so that was a little disappointing as well. I would not have even mentioned the promotion, but since they asked I was shocked nothing was done.   Safe to say, we will not be dinning at Orange Sky again.",

The service was excellent and our server had personality, which is nice because typically at high end restaurants its been my experience staff can be rigid or uptight. If you are in the Scottsdale area definitely try this restaurant out. There is a casino on the lower level if you are interested in gambling after.",

The sea bass was impeccable. The elk was amazing. The sides were creative and full of flavor. The scallops were delicious As well and a great add on. Appetizers weren't the best part of the meal. But the view.....Oh the view. Do NOT miss this restaurant! Don't be fooled that it's in the same building as a casino. This is a 5 star dining experience. Be sure to look up the sunset times and plan your meal around that. They have private booths and window seating. Ask for those!!!!",

    "text": "Though I have been to the Talking Stick Resort and Casino and its restaurants several times, I have never had the pleasure to eat at Orange Sky.  Orange Sky is certainly fine dining at its finest with an amazing sunset view!  It's on the 15th floor of the resort and has huge floor-to-ceiling windows for the views.  In fact, Orange Sky has a 360 degree view of the Valley of the Sun, so walk around the restaurant before or after your meal to see the different views.  My girlfriend and I were invited to join my parents for my mother's birthday.  The experience and yes, the food and drinks were all incredible!  To celebrate a special occasion, we reserved a private dining booth for the four of us.  It was comfortable with pillows, a glass wall to see the view of Scottsdale and the sunset, a wall behind us, and curtains on either side.  I learned later that minimums apply when you reserve a booth.  It was certainly worth it though!  Other spaces available for reservations include the community table, the wine room, the chef's room, the patio, and cocktail reception areas.     After we ordered drinks, we decided we wanted to order a shared plate for the four of us.  While we went back and forth between the Artisan Cheese Board (seasonal variety of cheeses, local honey, bourbon cherries, and macron almonds) or the Nosh Board (aged cheddar fondue, artisan cured meats, and vegetable pickles), we eventually went for the Artisan Cheese Board, as each of us was excited about something else on the board.  When it was time to order our food, I ordered the Mesquite Rubbed Organic Chicken with sorghum, golden raisins, tot soi.  My three guests each ordered seafood dishes:  (1) Georges Bank Diver Scallops with avocado, chile-miso butter, (2), Skuna Bay Salmon with cedar roasted, mustard gremolata, and 3 Shrimp & Scallop Steaks, prawns and divers wrapped in jalapeno bacon.  We also ordered two accompaniments:  (1) cauliflower and aged cheddar gratin, parsnip and (2) green chile whipped potatoes.    That was plenty of food though the fun wasn't over yet!  Our wonderful wait staff brought out a special dessert with some chocolate mousse cake, chocolate gelato, and berries in a nice display.  The wait staff certainly made us feel valued, and I can see myself coming back again for another special occasion in the future.  Unfortunately, as the prices are quite high, I cannot imagine myself eating at Orange Sky for a casual meal.",

Unexpectedly the automatic blinds open to sheer curtains revealing pointing mountain tips. As you wait with anticipation the sheer blinds slowly pull back to reveal breathtaking view of the the sun plunging deeply into the crevice between the two large alert mountain points. It's fabulous!    The menu changes frequently but this summer if you make it try the smashed potatoes with sherry vinegar and artichoke hearts. You're welcome in advance. Steak is always perfect and there is always a variety of wild game options.   Claudia the hostess worked with us with no reservations much appreciation to a great young lady with a fabulous attitude. Our waiter Julio is the deep voiced master of menus. Great staff, great chef, great view.",

The meal itself was a three star experience, but when you consider the incredible ambiance, I could have been eating McDonalds and wouldn't have cared.   I was more than impressed with the atmosphere before we even sat down. We waited for our seats on a glass balcony that protected us from the wind and while standing at the handsome curved bar. Walking to our table, we passed many an elegant private room and some booths with views that would have made for perfect date nights. Our group made reservations far in advance, so we were guaranteed a lovely patio setting with panoramic views.   The service was prompt and consistent. My only beef (no pun intended) was with the beef tenderloin, two four ounce cuts presented plainly and without any accompaniments on a large white plate. Talk about feeling like you didn't get your moneys worth. The beef was tasty, but it left me hungry enough that I needed sides and to share someone else's plate just to be full.   That one dish was the only hiccup. Other than that, you can expect a memorable dining experience that you'll surely be reccomending to friends!",

First, the sunset views and private patios cannot be beat! Talk about romantic!   Now on to the food -- They serve yummy warm bread to start. Next, I split the caesar salad, filet, and scallops with a co-worker. The scallops were melt-in-your-mouth good. Holy yum, I could eat them every day! The steak was also amazing but the presentation left much to be desired. For sides, we split the crushed potatoes and kale. Oh my goodness, both were heavenly and the potatoes even had artichoke hearts in them!!! SOLD!   Although this is a pricey meal, I do think that it is worth it! Great views, great service, great food, what else could you want in a fine dining experience? I hinted at my fiance that this is a very romantic spot and would be great for a special occasion {especially because he loves sunets}. ;) I'm sure that we'll be back someday soon!",

There were 12 in line but it didn't really move for 15 mins.  We arrived here at 7:30 on a Saturday night but the restaurant was full, so we ate in the lounge.   I ordered the 3 bacon wrapped scallop and shrimp plate. My wife got the ribeye. We also added a plate of smashed potatoes and three drinks for $150.   Scallops were overcooked but it had a good flavor combo with the two proteins, which were both large. It came with a pea puree plus a small frisee salad, so it was presented well.   The steak was excellent with the accompanying savory sauce on the side. The meat was cooked perfectly despite being 3/4\" thick. The ribeye flavor was well pronounced because they didn't over season it. Yay! The potato dish had pancetta and artichoke hearts for a well constructed side. The garlic and shaved asiago cheese set it off well.   The service was very good, despite eating dinner in a cocktail lounge. The table was rather small but we pulled it off.   I recommend Orange Sky for a romantic, fun evening.",

We started off with the cheese board, and a nosh board. The amounts were tiny (but I am used to Postino which are a bit more generous) but it didn't spoil our dinner and was yummy to snack on. I ordered a prickly pear margarita, husband and father in law each got a Manhattan, and my mother in law ordered a glass of white wine. The drinks were AMAZING, and well worth the price.  Most of us got steak, one person got chicken, and one person got the veal. Everyone loved their food, and we split 3 orders of the white cheddar mashed potatoes, and an order of the beets. Our server (Dane) was quite good, although his jokes seemed a bit rehearsed at times. We would be having a conversation and he would try to join in with some random joke. I'm all about bantering (I used to work at a restaurant and love to show appreciation to those who still do) but it just seemed a bit forced. Everyone except my husband and I ordered a dessert, and then Dane brought each of us a truffle to end the meal with, which was nice. Bill came out to $560, including tip and tax, for six people. However, that included 2 appetizers, 4 drinks, 6 meals, 4 sides, and 4 desserts. Definitely pricy compared to where I normally go, but I am already asking my husband when we can go back! Everyone was very nice, and the live music was very soothing too.",

    "text": "my impression of Orange Sky?  in a word, inconsistent.  but when you're paying for fine dining, you have high expectations, and those were not met.  if this were a mid-priced restaurant, i would rate it higher, as my food was good.  the others in my party did not enjoy theirs nearly as much.  we were surrounded by multiple staff when we entered, and while they were pleasant and friendly, they seemed inexperienced, as if they were unsure as to who should do what.  when our server was finally identified, he was able to answer questions about the menu items, but unable to confidently recommend anything.  one of my party asked what his favorite was; he answered with 4 or 5 dishes. when she asked about another dish, he agreed - yes, that, too.  he was either guessing, or rehearsing a scene from a light comedy.  diner: what do you recommend? server: whatever it is that you're thinking of ordering.  there was a long wait to get our food, even tho the place seemed fairly empty of diners.  maybe the chef was also guessing?  some of the portions were huge and others small.  one of the side dishes looked burned, and was dry.  again, everyone was very nice, but it was as if they had been plucked from another venue and assigned to Orange Sky without much instruction or guidance.  i hope they get this sorted.  the location is great, and both the staff and diners deserve better.",

You can dine looking West during sunset, eat inside or in the back outside patio, overlooking the McDowell mountains. The food is fantastic and so is the service, so make sure to make reservations. I will say that the decor, atmosphere and menu is very high end so if you're picky, you may want to view the menu online before you visit. Overall you will enjoy the relaxing experience they provide.",

We ordered the finest wine, seafood platter and ribeye steaks. They were excellent and the steak was amazing.

Everything that came out on our plates was decidedly snack-sized. Plan to spend $75-$100 per person for dinner, but be sure to budget an extra $20 for McDonald's on the way home because you'll still be hungry afterward.  This is \"girl food\" at extremely expensive prices. There's much better value for your money elsewhere in Phoenix.",

Very fresh seafood and not overly fussed with so the quality shines through!   The king crab was shelled which was an added treat for me.   There is also an extensive wine menu to choose from.",

I would have to say it is definitely overrated , I always read reviews on restaurant before I go, so I know some of the reviews on this restaurant is definitely over rated ! We got the famous Diver scallops dish, that dish was $36 or $38 for 4 little pieces of scallops that still tasted sandy , and we also got the \"tajima wagyu striploin \" which I felt like we got ripped off on that, it was suppose to be a 10oz steak , but it did not look like a 10oz and it cost us $85 dollars just for that little with no sides that comes with it , if you don't like fatty meat, I would definitely not suggest that dish , we got the \"broccolini\" to share, and it was so so , and also kind of cold! The only thing we actually really enjoyed was their delicious dessert wine and their peach pie for desert !",

When we originally got the reservation I was nervous that it would just be a standard steakhouse like I am used to in Chicago. They did have great steak options but so much more! Their sides menu was very unique and oh so delicious. We also had a vegetarian in our group and the bent over backwards to highlight the options on the menu that could be turned vegetarian AND also had a vegetarian option not listed on the menu. That was the ravioli and it was one of the best ravioli dishes I've ever had! They have an option to reserve a booth that overlooks the valley and I highly suggest this for a date night.",

They were wrapped in bacon with a jalapeno flavor that was the best thing I've ever had! I could have eaten way more of those.

I'll start by saying this is already an advantaged encounter because of its location. Situated on the top of Talking Stick Resort, on Indian Bend and 101. You get a wonderful 270 degree view of the valley. My best friend and I were lucky enough to catch the sunset. I recommend you bring a nice camera cause I took amazing pictures. Upon our arrival, they immediately seated us. I wasn't thrilled they put us in the middle of the dining room, but I later found out this restaurant charges you an extra fee for a table with a view. Fair enough. We stepped outside several times for pictures so it was good anyway.   Michael was our server, he did a great job introducing specials and giving us recommendations on dishes. We started with crab cakes, then I had the shrimp and scallops, my girlfriend had the halibut. Both good. But what impressed us most was the sweet potato side with goat cheese! We LOVED it!  Since it was my birthday, desserts were on the house. Very nice of them.   Atmosphere was trendy, this is a perfect place to dress up and put your favorite heels on! ;) it was a Friday night and they also had live music with a moderate spacious dancing floor.  So do you want to have a good time and awesome food? Go to this restaurant!  Thank you Orange Sky, our experience was unforgettable.",

    "text": "Ah, the casino and the restaurants within it. There are folks from all walks of life trying to make it big and get lucky. Those who don't (and the few that do), settle for a delicious meal at this establishment. Located at the very top of the talking stick resort, it is somewhat of a contrasting environment. On one hand, there is extremely expensive food and a top notch view. At the same time, you have folks dressed in country clothing, others in suits and others just in tshirts. It is a very confusing vibe and frankly, not much different from the casino itself. Just be ready for some people watching.   Ron Dimas, the chef here, aspires to keep the heritage of a restaurant in a Native American casino and has a few dishes inspired by Native American cuisine. Started off the meal with a very good soup, part minestrone, part their own creation, it was extremely delicious. It wasn't just some \"cream of ...\" soup, but had lots of vegetables and a spectacular broth. Continued with the main course of wild boar tenderloin, which was dry and did not have much of that delicious boar taste to it. I suspect they must have marinated it quite a bit to get the gaminess out or it was frozen, which is too bad. I do respect that some people may like having less gamey taste and the chef is catering to that. Onions served with the boar were completely burned unfortunately. Then, there was a side of ricotta ravioli or another pasta, can't recall which, but it was delicious. Finished it off with a dessert special of the day, which was unfortunately oversweetened. There were complimentary house made chocolates provided and you can't complain about free stuff, but they were mostly sugar and little taste to them.   The view of course makes this place the spot to be. For a one time visit, I would recommend making a visit. The water feature on the rooftop is very cool and makes photography easy. Our waiter (I believe Brandon) was spectacular, very kind and attentive. The food overall was good, with some highlights and some disappointments. Overall, enjoyed the meal, but not quite sure if I'd come back given the very steep price tag and a mixed experience. Despite some dishes being delicious, others left me wondering why.",

    "text": "I reserved this restaurant a while ago as I wanted my hubby and son to have a nice steak or seafood dinner when we arrived in Scottsdale....plus I heard the view of the sunset is amazing. I got 2 responses to my question on yelp if they would make a vegan, gf meal for me....both said yes. I even got a phone call a couple of days before my reservation and the lady told me there is no separate vegan menu but they can tell me some options when I arrive. We arrived and took the elevator up to the restaurant on the 15th floor. The large open lounge was lovely with windows all around. We were taken through a long Hall that had private dining rooms and sectioned off sofa seating facing the window to see the sunset.....a romantic date night experience I think. We were in the main dining room by the window and they opened the curtains for us to view the sunset. I captured it in time-lapse on my phone. The patio seating was full but we were able to go out there and see the infinity pool on the patio and the lovely view of the mountains. When it came time to order, I was told the vegan option was a vegetable plate. No tofu, no quinoa or grains, just a variety of vegetables. There was no vegan/gf option for appetizer. I was very annoyed and did let my server, Lori, and the manager (Nicole?) know. For such a high end restaurant I expected a lot better in terms of options. My guys ordered 3 apps.....crab and corn fritters, crusted shrimp and mushroom bruschetta. They loved all of them. I really wanted to be upset with my vegetable plate but the chef did a good job. The sweet potato was cooked nicely and topped with walnuts. The shredded Brussels sprouts were warm and too salty, but flavourful. The collard greens/mushrooms/onions were glazed in balsamic I think and were spicy. The asparagus was steamed and bland. Overall, the veg plate was decent. My son had the angel food cake for dessert but said it was too plain. The staff were friendly and nice, but a little slow in clearing dishes. The food arrived quickly. The decor was very nice and the washrooms were clean and decent. The pricing was on the expensive side but overall it was a better experience than I expected when I first sat down.",

I thought maybe it was me but the other person at the table who got the rib eye agreed.  Not only did I ask for it medium rare and it was definitely cooked all the way through but it was incredibly fatty.  Now I know rib eyes tend to have more fat than other slices but I had to really use my muscles to work out any edible meat in this 17 oz.  I shouldn't be able to eat 17 oz so I'm guessing from my plate at the end of the night I probably got 4 oz, if I'm lucky, out of it.  The view is amazing at this place and our waiter was really nice but considering the cost of this place, I wouldn't ever order a steak here again and it would have probably been the only reason I would have gone.",

There was also a lovely live band playing in the hall music  As for the view, I'd LOVE to dine here again during sunset.After all, there aren't many restaurants located high enough for a scenic view in Arizona, right?   I highly recommend this place for a nice date. Definitely get the private booth during sunset!",

    "text": "To start the live music is amazing and the hostess staff that greet you are so professional and kind. We had a reservation and showed up a little early and told them we would grab some drinks before until they were ready for us. The staff said we could go ahead and head back to our table. We had a private dining experience and it was absolutely stunning. The view was perfect to watch the sunset and the room felt like private dining. Very comfortable! Our server demitrio was not only knowledgeable of the menu but allowed us to take our time and even encouraged us to go look at the view from the patio.   I am so thankful we did because the view of the golf course from the top of the building was stunning! There aren't enough kind words for our server he was amazing and so very kind. He knew my boyfriend would be purposing to me and wanted it to be special and I knew after that he knew ahead of time. Knowing that now really makes me appreciate all he did even more to make my night special. He doesn't even know me and he went above and beyond for us! I recommend asking for him at your next visit.   Now for the food...I ordered the salmon and he ordered the filet. It was amazing! The salmon was seasoned to perfection and fell apart with my fork. The side of crushed potatoes was one of my new favorite dishes and he loved the perfect cook to his steak. We were stuffed by the end! Then to finish it up he brought out a desert that said congratulations! So sweet of them to do that and then knowing I had a dairy allergy brought me out the most delicious sorbet I have ever had. I will literally dream of the apple and cherry sorbet. Seriously it was amazing. They know what they are doing and if you are considering coming here for any special occasion or just for an amazing dining experience I definitely recommend it.",

    "text": "Although I had originally planned this as a business meeting for three; instead of cancelling the reservation, I opted to keep it and convert it to a nice intimate dinner for my wife and I.  As we traversed the long corridor towards the main dining room; my wife commented on the west facing booths for couples, asking why we didn't get those tables?  I summarily and promptly quipped that I had originally meant this reservation for our foreign business guests, and I didn't think it was appropriate that we share such an intimate setting.  She chuckled as we proceeded along, and was immediately impressed by the panoramic view presented to us as we entered the main dining room.  We were promptly seated; and Faye, our server, cheerfully greeted us. She went through the customary introductions, and proceeded to take our drink orders. Kyle, her support wait staff, promptly filled our water glasses.  We ordered the Nosh Board, which is a combination of aged fondue, cured meats, and pickles. They were absolutely fabulous, and the inclusion of the Marcona Almonds just added another dimension to this delectable shared plate.  I was quite famished; therefore, I opted for the 17 ounce Rib-Eye Steak. My wife ordered the New York strip. For our shared sides, we ordered the Asparagus (I love asparagus!), and the Smashed Potatoes.  My steak was quite tender and juicy, and the remaining portion after cooking was quite prodigious. The flavor didn't quite permeate all the way; probably because of the way that it was prepared, but it was quite delectable, nonetheless.  My wife's steak wasn't quite as juicy as mine, and certainly much smaller, but none of this detracted from its overall superb flavor.  Overall, the presentation, care and preparation of our food was definitely superlative. Faye, and her support wait staff were absolutely on point in every aspect - fleetly anticipating our needs as we progressed through the evening's meal.  And what about the view that everyone comments about?   Well, it's always quite challenging to articulate the experience that accompanies a personal visual perspective. All I can say is that you need to experience it yourself; especially during a beautiful sunset because it definitely is quite splendid.",

We ate after 8:00pm and would have enjoyed it more at an earlier time.  Mostly, everyone was nice from the hostesses to the waiter who took our order.  The only wait-person not up to parr was the man who plopped our food orders down on the table and clanged the silverware on the plates doing so.  He wasn't the man who took our order, just the guy delivering the food.  He probably needs some coaching in that respect, as well as how to say \"enjoy your food\" in a more pleasant voice. Maybe he was just having a bad night. All in all, we enjoyed the meal and the complementary \"birthday dessert\" and would go back to catch the sunset.",

My friend and I get on the elevator and we were asked if we had reservations, no we did not.  We stated we simply wanted to grab a drink and watch the sunset.  We were told by the snippy little elevator worker that \"it was at capacity\".  He then said he'd take us on a ride to the top and we could briefly peek out the elevator door.  My friend and I kind of rolled our eyes at each other and played along.  We get to the top and the damn lounge area was wide open.  What is capacity?  To have half of your seats empty?  We promptly walked out of the elevator and were told by the obnoxious elevator guy that because it was 'at capacity' we couldn't get out.    We ignored him and walked up to the bar and ordered drinks.  We then walked right up to empty chairs BY THE WINDOW FACING SUNSET and relaxed.    So while the lounge is gorgeous and the views of sunset are spectacular.... how about you get off your high horse Mr Elevator Director and chill out?  The lounge was in no way crowded, at capacity, or anywhere near. There were empty seats everywhere.   It's laughable, but seriously...",

    "text": "I have to teeter between three and four stars on this one and tell you the short story is that the atmosphere is among the BEST so food almost doesn't matter. The decor is modern, beautiful and whimsical. The Food I tried was somewhat Basic and really was OK but was unlike the decor. (maybe I just wanted it to be a little fancier to wow me)  I thought the Kitchen not the servers seemed a bit out of sync to me on our visit here so  that helped influenced me to go with three stars.   This is a special destination place and is good for groups but  if you desire a private room for your group they must spend at least two thousand dollars. You also need to be aware That a three course dinner with a group of people takes about three hours.  I will say I don't agree with most of the reviewers saying the pricing is too high for what they got. I don't recall all the pricing but from what I remember  $24. for Jidori Chicken, $39. for Kolbe style hanger steak, $30 for Sea bass and $8 for ample sides are really what most places would charge.  I will say I didn't care about the parking because it was 118 degrees, I was all dressed up and didn't feel like walking threw the hot parking lot and we felt like valeting it but the valet was closed to people not staying over night in the casino.   While waiting for the group I was joining I decided to try a Negroni ($15.) Cocktail. It was made with all name brand stuff and was a double size. So I think it was a very fair price for a special old school cocktail that is one of Anthony Bourdain's last meal list. It's a very unique taste of bitter, sweet  but not too sweet and boldly strong in a good way and seemed kind of refreshing. They had live entertainment in the lounge and some people were dancing.  It was very dark in the restaurant and so you had to use your phone as a light to read the menu. Our group takes a very long time to decide so I do an Anthony Bourdain and decide to have another cocktail. I don't know how long it took but we arrived at 7 and I looked at my phone and saw it was 8:38 and we still didn't have appetizers yet. I was thinking that they'd come out with dinner but they didn't (Phew) and did arrive after some amount of time.   When my halibut arrived I found out it was dry and over cooked but the majority of meals that were served to our table were fine. The waiter asks me how it was and I was honest and said the halibut was very dry and over cooked but still edible and I didn't feel like sending it back. The waiter talked me out of feeling that way and said he'd have a new one for me shortly....and he DID! The new one was cooked just right so it was good. Nothing wrong with it just good sitting on some dried chili pineapple sauce. I did find out latter that the other person at my table with halibut also had dry halibut but didn't tell the waiter.   Over all I was happy and now know I also like Negroni Cocktails. Those cocktails are almost even healthy as the bitters in the drink are good for your liver and help contradict the gin.  The halibut was good but wasn't up there with a few others I had this year so that's why it's three star to me. I know everyone was happy and we would go back again.",

    "text": "What an absolutely incredible experience! Orange Sky is located on the 15th floor of the Talking Stick Resort. A private elevator whisks you upstairs, whereupon you are greeted by smiles and hellos by *every single person* with whom you come into contact. The staff is one of the friendliest and professional we've ever encountered. Great job, guys!! This is so important and so overlooked by other places!  So glad we made reservations on a Saturday night. We made our decision to go there in the afternoon so when we went to make the reservation, only 5:45pm or 9pm were available. Sunset was at 7:41 that night, so we went with the 5:45pm reservation. We wound up arriving late--a little after 6pm--but we were seated immediately.  It turned out that many other tables were available at that time, so if you go early without a reservation you'll probably get seated.  It didn't matter that we were early for the sunset, though. 6pm turned out to be the perfect time to enjoy the changing colors of the sky. And *that* is why I'm glad we made a reservation...because by being forced to go at 5:45 (in our ignorance we would have made a later reservation) we were able to fully enjoy the sky. The sun actually dropped completely at 7:41, leaving us with only light left until well after 8pm--no colors, so keep that in mind when calculating this! (Also, remember sunset changes during the year, depending on the season). We went one of the longest days of the year.  The space itself is unique. A modern main lounge area up front--with curved, modular seating and window views all around --further expands into another area where a piano sits. This area has additional seating and a dance floor.  You'll find the restaurant itself at the end of the long corridor. This hallway is flanked on one side by private tables with westward views, and on the other by two private party rooms and their state of the art kitchen.  Entering the main dining room for the first time is a treat for those who are already jaded by most high end restaurants. The room is vast, but warm and inviting, with a fireplace centered on the back wall. The 270' view is amazing. You can even dine or take drinks outside on the lavishly furnished patio. If you're lucky you'll see a glimpse of wild stallions running through the reservation  toward the east side. You can dress up here and ENJOY it. It is worth the effort.  The food here is stellar. We both had the Chilean sea bass, and shared sides of corn with chard, and green chile mashed potatoes. The bass was cooked sparingly and to absolute perfection, which delighted our server when we told him. (He said that many people expect it to be cooked more--which ruins the delicate texture). It was seared and caramelized on the outside and *barely* raw in the center--just a wisp. Perfect.  The sides were huge. Each side feeds two people, possibly three. We shared a full bottle of sauvignon blanc, drank tap and sparkling water, and finished with French press coffee. Our anniversary was earlier in the week, and the waiter brought us a gratis chocolate mousse desert with a \"Happy Anniversary\" message to share.  The bill came with two caramel/chocolate candies that seemed homemade. It was phenomenal caramel! Our entire bill was $130. We expected to pay more. We cannot recommend this restaurant enough! The value is there. The food, most importantly, is fantastic. And really...isn't that what dining is all about if you are going to go out with people you love to share it?  GREAT PLACE!!",

It is so cool to do this. The view from the room is amazing and they open the curtains for you to watch the sunset in private. You can walk outside while you are waiting for your food to a really nice patio type area where you can bring your drinks and relax.   The food was really good overall, but  not what you'd expect from a restaurant so amazing in every other way. We ordered the filet, scallops, crab, oysters, and cheese plate. The filet and scallops were cooked perfectly, but both had a little too much seasoning for our taste. The crab was seasoned much better, but slightly overcooked. The oysters and cheese plate were both nice, but nothing exceptional. The desert was fantastic.   I would recommend Orange Sky to anyone looking for a special occasion place. The view really sets this place apart from any other restaurant in the area that I can think of.",

The food is four diamond rated and rightfully deserving. Highly recommend the small plate, which features scallops served on their original shells, to start with. Some other highlights feature the rib eye and sea bass which are beyond reasonably priced for their quality. Our server, Julio, was amazing and was there attentively throughout the night with helpful suggestions and whitty banter. He even went above and beyond when it came to dealing with a very particular/demanding customer such as my father. Oh and did I mention the view is FANTASTIC!",

The wonderful restaurant manager, Kristina P., was so professional and friendly when I called to arrange the reservations and made it very special. She made sure that our view and table was one of the best. I have to mention that pretty much all of the tables have outstanding views of the desert mountains and gorgeous sunsets, hence the name, Orange Sky. The food was outstanding, and we are picky! The menu selection is one of the best and will cater to fish, beef, vegetarian, and chicken lovers, so many options! Some of my favorites were the seafood appetizer platter, the green chili mashed potatoes, and the scallops! Kyle, our waiter, was so personable and informative. He really made sure about having no nuts on anything at the table, we have a nut allergy. The service overall was magnificent, from the minute you arrive. If you ask where the ladies room is, they actually walk you to it. I want to credit, Kristina, for hiring and training a great staff! Thank you to the great chef too! We will be back when visiting AZ!  P.S. There is a gorgeous huge outdoor deck with the most perfect opportunities to take pictures with a beautiful back drop!",

When I dine at a finer establishment, it irks me when the wait staff is \"in my way\". Ex: they constantly check up on our table, interrupt the tables' conversation. The staff here are experts at being invisible. Props! (Please don't think I am a jerk, but a great waiter/waitress is a skill and a talent. Let's face it, we're there for the experience with the guests we bring) Not to mention, tables get 2-3 wait staff at a time, so everything comes out at the same time. They are also so polished, and smooth. The wait staff must be mind readers; only coming when they pick up on the electrical impulses from when you just begin thinking you need something, before you can say it.  Sorry to drone on, but this kind of thing I really notice.  2. The steak is really, really well prepared. Now, some people may balk on more well-known places, but the preparation in conjunction with the sides make it my favorite place to get a NY strip.  3. To sum everything up, I've not had a bad experience here. The staff, food, service...heck the men's restroom, is flawless.  I'll update the review when I go back!",

We shared a bottle of lovely wine while Julio, our server, described the various menu options and fielded our questions. Service is perfect. We had the elk loin for 2 served Oscar style and it was delicious. The portions were very generous. We had a big bag of food to take home. Highly recommend this.

However, I think the prices are too high for the quality & taste of the food. I had to 'try' to like everything..  Starters= mediocre  Salad= bad  (Steak) Entree= horrible !!  Dessert= boring menu, so we ordered 3 different things hoping to like One, also very mediocre :/  The kitchen really needs to step it up!",

    "text": "Very disappointing. We were so excited to try this place and made a reservation to watch the sunset from the dining room. There is a $200 minimum for certain tables but I was reassured by 'Joyce' more than once that this was not one of those tables. When we arrived they questioned our intentions with our table, whether we were having a full dinner service or appetizers or what. I mentioned that I was told the table I reserved had no minimum but the girl who led us to it said we had to all have dinner. Not everyone wanted full dinner service but would rather share some things off the regular menu. They said that wasn't possible and escorted us back to the lounge. We ordered drinks and appetizers from the lounge menu and got an appetizer from the regular menu (and still spent over $200) but were brought zero silverware so couldn't eat it and needed to get someone to the airport. The waitress was nowhere to be found for the majority of the time and I had to chase her down to pay the tab. Oh, the view is good though if all the other bs is worth your time. Won't be back. There's better views and better service at plenty of other places",

    "text": "The ambiance was great and food great.. Unfortunately service not so great.. Ordered  one 17 oz ribeye and two filets.. Served three filet.. took one back but wrong one so my friend got a rare filet instead of med well..Ordered wine but had dregs . Alot of dregs in glass.. maybe they shouldnt pour last inch of bottle. Dessert described as mint chocolate mousse. It was chocolate mousse with a bottom layer of tasteless mint jelly.. should be described as layered chocolate mousse with mint leaf on bottom..So dessert was overall disappointing. The ribeye and one glass of wine taken off bill which was nice but I would rather have good service and pay. Finally, manager never came by which again would be more important than free food. I expect to pay but good service is just as important as good food.. Hostess was great and bartender also great",
