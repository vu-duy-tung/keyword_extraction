    "text": "\"Oh, look,\" I say, \"They have a 'to-go' counter.\"  But not an expedient one.  You order off of the menu and then they make your food, and if you're me, then they make the wrong thing and have to make it again.  So twenty minutes later, you can go catch up with your friends and actually board your plane.  They did give me the botch, though, which was a nice bonus.  Food was a little bland and not quite as delicious as I'd been hoping for.  I also found the breakfast sandwich a little difficult to eat while I was sitting on the plane, worrying that I wouldn't be able to bite into the giant bread without squirting over-easy egg onto everything surrounding me.    Sadly, it's about the only restaurant in this terminal, though it looks as though they might be building another one.",

    "text": "Currently waiting in line, so I can't rate the food. And I don't really care about the price (it's an airport, that's expected). But a 25-minute wait (and still counting...) for a take-out order of tacos and a torta is completely unacceptable, especially in a virtually empty airport with the tables in the restaurant area only half full.  They're somewhat new. Hopefully the next time we're here, these serious problems will be resolved. And if it's not, hopefully they'll be replaced by the next time after that. They need to fail if they can't figure this out.  *Update*: After a 30-minute wait, I decided to run to the plane (which was otherwise boarded and ready to go). After I asked for my money back, the employee at the register did not respond to me at all, then went to the kitchen window gave me one of the two to-go boxes and said it would only be a little while longer. I couldn't wait, so I figured we'd just split the one meal. Of course, it wasn't even our order. So in addition to my awful experience, that means someone else who was waiting also did not get their order (because I got it). And the torta we did get was not very good.   Ultimately, I share some blame in this. I read these other one-star Yelp reviews and still went there anyway. That was a huge mistake. This place is a disaster.",

You know, what can you REALLY expect from an airport restaurant.  You don't go for the food.  If you're really hungry enough to eat at the airport, then don't expect 4 star restaurant quality.... and don't judge the airport restaurants as such.   This really is the only bar/restaurant option in the Southwest terminal.  I found a security guard and asked about some of the other restaurants in the airport and was told that unless you want to make the 20-30 minute hike around security to get around to some of the other gates, you should just stay put.  I'm actually glad he suggested this- even though I had a 3 hour layover.  The menu LOOKS impressive... but again, remember where you are.  I did happen to be starving and needed a little something to soak up the drinks I would be consuming during my loooong layover.  I ordered the poblano burritto.  For an airport burrito it wasn't bad- but it was slightly lacking in flavor.  I asked for something to add some spice and they provided me with three different kinds of salsa to try, which did make it a little better.    What most impressed me was the service.  The bartenders and servers were all upbeat and smiley- very friendly and definitely created a welcoming atmosphere.  The drinks were not HORRIBLY over- priced and now if you order a beer, you can add a shot of ANYTHING for $4!  I got a shot of Don Julio (which might normally be at least $10+) so ended up paying $11 for a 20oz Modelo Especial and excellent tequila.    And other reviewers were right.... this is definitely a great place for eye candy!  All the hotties seem to flock here...",

We also ordered the pork tacos and all of the pork was very fatty, I couldn't even eat it. I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!",

It's great for people watching and although much of the food is stylized versions of Mexican food, including a lot of quick prep, reheat and serve kind of food, it's actually pretty tasty. I've had the shrimp tacos and they are pretty tasty, a bit over battered but good just the same. The fish taco plate is actually pretty decent size portion (4 tacos) for the money. Considering you are trapped for food choices the prices aren't too out of whack. The only major downside, and it is out of their control, is the volume of a/c being pumped into the terminal creates cold/windy spots in the dining room.",

Also enjoyed some delicious Fresh orange juice.  Service was fast and the restaurant clean. Btw the restrooms are just outside the restaurant entrance. If you have time between flights, this is a good place to grab a meal. Only complaint...not exclusive to this restaurant....why do you seat customers on top of each other when the restaurant is about 20% full? When we were initially being seated, the hostess proceeded to take us to a table right next to another couple, a two top right next to them.  We asked if we could have a another table so that we would give them and us  privacy considering the restaurant was not full.   Then the hostess proceeded to seat a gentleman right next to us, literally an arms length away...when there was clearly 10 to 20 tables she could've been seated him at... So, we got to listen to him talk on the cell phone while we ate breakfast and he got to listen to us talk...Just asking for some commonsense and thoughtfulness please.",

I got the Chiles en Nogada, which is a \"roasted poblano pepper filled with chicken, dried fruits, apples and pears all in a delicate almond cream reduction.\" I was floored with how good it was. Pricey at $26, but wow. Amazing taste, texture, and presentation.  My girlfriend got the Tacos de Pollo Poblano, which include \"grilled spiced chicken breast, roasted poblano peppers, caramelized garlic and onion, tomatillo cream reduction, goat cheese, pine nuts, and crema Mexicana.\" Delicious and filling at $14.  To top it off, our server Carma was attentive to us and every table around us. She made the hectic dinner rush look like no big deal. A True professional. We will definitely be back for more.",

It gave it a \"divey/neighbourhood\" feel.    I had the fish tacos which were OK.  The fries that came with it kinda sucked.  They were pretty stale.  The ketchup was pretty good, it had spicy kick to it.  At $15 for three tacos however it's a bit over priced even for airport food.  Sitting at the bar you're able to witness some stuff.  I should've followed my instincts and just pushed my tacos away.  Hygiene wasn't great with the staff.  One bartender got choked up and started coughing...immediately proceeded to make drinks with out washing his hands.  Another came by to pick up some cut limes clearing her throat over them, they were unwrapped. This is after I received my meal and got given silverware that looked a little dingy.  To make matters worst...a 1/4 way through my flight my stomach did not feel so good.  Luckily my flight was short and my place is near the airport, otherwise I would had blown up the bathroom (no pun intended)  Overall...stay away from here if you plan on grabbing a quick bite between flights.  It's overpriced and mediocre at best...and food poisoning on a flight is no fun. The star is more for the atmosphere of the bar area.  Bartenders should clean up a bit more though",

Moist and nicely seasoned chicken and sauce with goat cheese (no rice/beans) :). Far from the usual gut bomb at other Mexican restaurants. Of course it's on the pricey side but well worth it. Serves fresh coffee made in a French press. The caramel filled Churros made the perfect finishing touch! Great service too! Highly recommended. We'll definitely dine there again on our next trip... time permitting.",

I could taste the tequila in a well balanced margarita. They did well by my husbands gin martini too.   I ordered the pork tacos and my husband had the chicken tacos. Yes. They were spicy. If you like heat - they were delicious!  The pork was their special slow roasted pork and very tasty. The chicken tacos had a delicious cream sauce. We chose the house salad.  The salad was made from salad greens and topped with onions, tomatoes and crumble cheese. The salad was lightly dressed with balsamic vinaigrette. Presentation was excellent.

I guess this was her attempt at humor, however after the first time, it seemed to have lost something. By the way, she never really indicated that she was joking.  So, $50, 1 ceasar salad, 1 spinach chicken whatever salad,  a kids chicken tender meal w/ browning apples, and a failed attempt at a pollo poblano burrito later we were on our way to catch our flight.   Oh, in between sitting down and paying the check, the service was sub-par to say the least and worse than the cold, soggy burrito and rubberized tenders. The waitress never picked up our menus and never once smiled.   While I understand we ate at an airport, this is unacceptable. Next time I'll be sure to read up on more yelp reviews before I waste a meal here.   They'll be hearing from me soon.",

Hubby got the Arizona burrito and I the shrimp tacos both with side salads. Fresh avocado slices topped the tacos even though not mentioned on menu - which made them perfect. Only complaint was each taco only came with 1 shrimp and chips/salsa were not included on table with our meal as we would see at other similar restaurants (maybe not custom @ airport setting?). Hubby described pork as a stewed pork with good flavor in large flour tortilla. Service was super quick, friendly and food surprisingly yummy. Would eat here again.",

I happened upon Barrio cafe, which was right next to my gate. I sat at the bar, ordered a beer, and took a look at their menu. They don't have a very big selection, especially for breakfast. I can't fault them for that - they're a restaurant in an airport. They're also expensive - again, I don't fault them too much for that. The food came out quickly, the bartender was nice and helpful. It helped me accept that my vacation in Arizona was over.",

Big bold letters on the sign that say \"please wait to be seated.\" After 5 mins i sat myself and the mysterious hostess arrives out of nowhere and says \"you need to wait to be seated.\"  I just stared at her and didn't respond at all.  She handed me a menu.   I took this is validation it was OK to be seated here.  I wait 10-15 mins without anyone asking me if I wanted a water, etc.  I got up and left.  Never again will I come here.  P.s. I fly in and out of Phoenix about 6 times a month.  I would have eat here every time.  Average bill of $20 x 6 times a month x 12 months = $1,440 in lost sales.",

We were seated and greeted and provided water right away.  Our server was friendly and attentive throughout our whole meal.   When I looked over the menu, I discovered it wasn't really your standard Mexican food and the husband was disappointed not to find beans and rice on any of the dishes.  We both ended up going with tacos,  I got the fish tacos and I think he got the chicken tacos.  All I know is they were FANTASTIC. Both came with a small green salad with a spicy vinagerette that was tangy and zesty.  The husband never gets vinegarette and he loved it. My tacos came with good sized slices of Avocado and were super tasty.  It was the perfect amount of food and my fish was battered and crunchy on the outside and flaky on the inside.  We were skeptical when we ordered, but both agree we were very happy with the choice. If you're in Sky Harbor awaiting a flight, I totally recommend Barrio Cafe.  Its not your regular Mexican Restaurant, but the tacos are delish.",

Although it's advertised as being served with chorizo, I barely found more than a few chunks... 1-2 ounces at most. The cheese was a poor attempt at being \"melted.\" The bread was extremely chewy, like I had to use some strength to pull it apart with my teeth. The scrambled eggs and pico were the only redeeming components, but at $13.00 they were hardly worth it. Obviously the high standards that are applied at her other restaurants are not even a consideration at the airport location. Such a shame.",

I ordered just a traditional margarita on the rocks with salt and in my mind, I imagined it to arrive in a big wide rimmed margarita glass but instead it came to me in a tiny quarter size larger than a shot glass! World's smallest margarita, mostly made up of ice. I then decided to try a chicken quesadilla and found it to be the exact opposite of what a traditional quesadilla is.... it was an open faced corn tortilla more like a tostada but limp... okay I guess it was a taco?? So strange. After tasting it I then realized they made the dish with cream cheese. So strange. Needless to say, I will not be back.",

I had the carne asada tacos and thought they were quite bland. The cheese they added to them was more sad than anything and it was dry and crumbly. My boyfriend had the AZ burrito and it was again, just ok. What I found to be really weird was that they had no chips on the menu( or at least from what I saw ). My boyfriend got French fries instead of chips since that's what they offered. I thought this was a bit odd as the flavors clashed a bit. I'd probably try the place next door the next time I went to PHX.",

It was okay, the marinated pork was good. Unfortunately the tortillas were soaking in the juice which made for a nasty soggy mess. Ramiro brought a fresh side of tortillas at no additional charge.

Perhaps I've grown a bit too used to the \"fake\" Mexican food in California however this place didn't come up short. I'll digress again and state that perhaps my expectations weren't all that heightened in lieu of this being \"airport food\".  I was quite taken aback. Haha... Maybe I'll fly back in for another meal.   Maybe....  Did I mention that my colleagues all became so inebriated on the booze served here that we all missed our flights??? Nothing better than being buzzed in an airport and having to wait standby for the next flight.  -___-",

What I had: *cochinita pibil-  meat was flavorful and tender, and large portions.  The sides it came with complimented the meat. *guac- what a nice, surprising twist adding pomegranate seeds to guac.  Nice how you can add items to the guac (like onions, cilantro, tomatoes, etc) and it is made fresh to order at the table.  I thought this place is the best airport food I have had.

    "text": "Inside the airport at the 'D' Gates, you will find two restaurants with sit down options. Barrio Cafe is one of them, but they lure you in because in addition to standard tables and chairs, they also have couches and lounge chairs.  Sign at the entrance says wait to be seated, but with only two wait staff running around a considerable area, I wasn't optimistic one of them would greet and seat me. Eventually, after a minute wait, a waiter with a smile on his face, yelled across the room as he was delivering someone's order, \"Seat yourself, anywhere is fine.\"  I found a nice two-seated, black leather couch in the corner. I occupied one of the seats, and my bags the other. A friendly waitress made her way to my area after about five minutes and delivered a menu and took my drink order. I wasn't that hungry, but I felt I might be on the verge of a migraine, so getting water to take my meds was paramount to me. I also ordered a Coca Cola to help give me a jolt of energy. I think I waited another 5 minutes for the drinks to arrive.  When you are in pain and wanting to take your meds, the wait for water is exceptionally noticeable.  The menu didn't really have anything appealing, so I ordered $10 guacamole from the appetizer menu. I was intrigued that mashed avocados could be listed at that price. Apparently you pay for the entertainment value. The waitress wheeled a cart that looked more like the bus boy cart in front of my coffee table and asked me if I wanted all of the ingredients. I said yes even though I had no idea what special ingredients might be included in this masterpiece. The waitress sprinkled, scooped and mixed about seven different items together, many of which I had no idea what they were. She then presented me with a small, red, mixing bowl with some mashed and some chunked avocado with bright red pomegranate seeds on top. This was highly unusual to me. I tried it, but the pomegranate seeds added to the mix didn't really do anything to enhance the flavor. I ate a few more bites to see if it would grow on me, but alas, I left the majority of the creation sitting in the bowl and promptly fell asleep on the couch using my bags as my pillow.  My waitress was kind enough not to disturb me, but she promptly attended to me when I awoke 30 minutes later asking if I wanted anything else. I told her that I wouldn't be getting anything else, but that I would be here for another 30 minutes since my flight was delayed. We settled the tab and I tipped her handsomely to compensate her for the loss of new customers that might have sat in her section on the couch.  The service was okay, the food selection and guacamole was...meh, especially considering the prices, the comfortable lounge seating was a nice perk, and with limited choices in this section of the airport, I might be forced to return, but hopefully not.",

I ordered take out once, service was terrible, and I'm never coming back.  I give it a try, so I order the Torta del Barrio to go, with fries. It's a vegetarian option for $13, including cheese stuffed peppers among other vegetables. One gentleman was in front of me, so I wait after my order.  Three people order after me within 15 minutes, each ordering items on the menu of similar preparation (one even got the same dish). They were ALL SERVED BEFORE ME! I ended up waiting for 35 minutes for a meal that wasn't even that good. The fries were soggy and bland, and the bread for the torta tasted stale. No way that cost $13, I could've made that for under $5.  The restaurant didn't look that much better. The place was packed, and they pumped out a couple dishes every 10 minutes. The majority of tables were not served the entire time I was there, and they definitely ordered before I arrived.  When you're trying to fly out, you want a quick bite to eat. The 35 minutes wait was inexcusable, especially since all those customers were served until I was dead last. The most I got out of the cashier was \"Sorry, I tried.\" If you're going to serve food at the airport, that kind of service won't cut it.  I've never said this before, but I'd have preferred fast food at the time.",

Fortunately, I'm not much of a meat eater so it made little difference to me. But, for $17, when I want chicken, I want more that 2 oz. scattered in little pieces throughout.   The sidebar guac looked entertaining although we did not partake. There's also televisions so you can watch the latest game before catching your flight.

She was older and when she approached our table, she mentioned that they have $4 tequila shots. She didn't really offer the shots, as much as she told us about the shots in a way that we felt like it was a demand. Being challenged, and essentially called a wimp, we ordered the shots. My husband and I NEVER order shots when it is just us.. but hey, way to take our vacation to the next level, lady! We also ordered a couple beers (heck yes to Golden Road brews!) and the Barrio Nachos. These nachos were really really good. Beef with sauteed mushrooms, garlic, onions, jalapenos, spinach, cream, chorizo and bleu cheese and \"fresh Mexican farm cheese\". They also came slightly \"deconstructed\" so it wasn't just a messy mash of flavors. The rest of the menu looked pretty interesting as well.. not your typical Mexican food and certainly not your typical airport food. The nachos were $15, but large and enough for 2 to have as a meal. Would definitely stop here again!",

There are so many great local food options here and I wouldn't say that Barrio is the best of them by far. They had some beer of draft so that was cool, just mexican beer though which isn't very exciting.   I ordered the Pork something Burrito which said it was Enchilada Style, with a side of Barrio Fries (only because my husband wanted fries). It's kind of weird to serve Seasoned Fries with a Burrito but whatever. The Burrito was just Pork, nothing else, and it hadn't even been filled all the way so there were gaps where filling should be and it was very thin for a Burrito. The Pork was fine, didn't see or taste the Green Chilies mentioned in the description and the Enchilada Style consisted of a teaspoon of grated Cheese pathetically sprinkled on top. The Tortilla was so soggy and not in a saucy Enchilada sort of way, in a watery wet nasty kind of way.   I ordered it to go so I couldn't really say anything but next time I'm going somewhere else. There are tons of other really great options in this airport!",

The food arrived in a surprisingly quick fashion and once I took my first bite I was in heaven.   My only issue was we asked the waiter for no mushrooms and it came with mushrooms. When we mentioned it he made a comment only four chips or so had the mushrooms. Are you serious? I would leave only 4 stars because of him as he was not friendly and was extremely slow on drink service. Waters and diet cokes...but the food redeemed him.  Back to the nachos. The chips were thick and delicious. The odd combination of spinach and bleu cheese added made an incredible addition to the nachos. Underneath the chips was a hidden liquidy sweet cheese we couldn't figure out what it was but didn't care it was SO good.   As mentioned before, I wasn't that hungry to begin with but once my sister stopped eating, I finished the whole plate. I would love to try and recreate these nachos but that seems near impossible.",

I know the signature dish is the puerco pibil, this will have to wait till my next visit. I was pleasantly surprised to have fresh spinach and blue cheese on my nachos platter. The cheese tasted like it was gourmet home made cheese. I like the story how authentic Mexican dishes with French influence plays a roll in the dishes served. Keep in mind this was what they served at the Phoenix Airport location. I really need to stop by the downtown location. My only complaint if I had one was the price being a little on the high side. $40 for two beers and a nachos plate. Honestly, you get what you pay for here though. I would totally do it again!  Great job Barrio Cafe!!!",

It's a pork roast that is seasoned, paired with chiles and sour oranges and then wrapped in banana leaves and roasted slow overnight. You cannot imagine.

We were told no, that would take 15 minutes.  Tacos are fast, and they were.  Beef is good, but if you like spicy, go for the pork. Pork it is.  Sadly, I am not sure how they managed to combine all those ingredients, and make it devoid of any flavor.  The salad that came with was the high point of the meal.

The tables are pretty small which makes sense as you want more people in an area, but with everyone hauling their carry on luggage it can get fun trying to walk in the aisles. Be careful folks.  Each table had a device where you can press one of three buttons to get your waiter's attention, get the check and there was another button I can't remember what it was for. The server wore a wristband that would notify them of the table calling for service. Pretty cool since this place gets busy being at the airport.  We ordered the guacamole Barrio ($12.35). The menu states it is prepared table side. Our guacamole came out in a bowl already prepared. The server had cilantro all over the plates she handed us. The guacamole was good, but needed some salt. Definitely had a spicy kick to it that I appreciated. The salsa that was brought out was very tasty too! The tortilla chips were thick so it was easy to scoop up the guacamole.  The Michelada with Dos XX (asked for it extra spicy) was not bad at all. The server recommended that over the Bloody Maria. Good choice.  Overall, the place is good and of course any time you buy ANYTHING at an airport it will be at a higher price than other places outside the airport. The food wasn't bad at all.  Good place to hang out at and watch the game. Must check out the murals in here. Pretty cool.",

Well I decided today to finally go and eat there since I love the actual restaurant on 16th street.  This place was a joke, I was so upset in the food because it was nothing, not even a little bit on how it is at their main location.  The enchilada suizas say they come with chorizo and they didn't, the sauce and cheese is not the one on the menu nor the one that should be used. The sides were also disgusting, I couldn't even eat them. My waitress was very nice and attentive but the food was just gross. Never will I ever eat at this one. My meal was 40 bucks for some nasty enchiladas and guacamole. It was ridiculous. It makes me more mad because I have gone to the original one and the food is phenomenal, so I was expecting the same thing.  Don't waste your time or money",

The restaurant wasn't busy at all otherwise I would've understood a little bit. There was a lot of servers walking around and chatting. Two were arguing about who swept the restaurant last... um you're not going to have any floors to sweep if no customers come because the lack of service. A table gets sat after us and they got greeted within minutes.   We got up and left. No one said anything. We clearly were ready to spend money on food and alcohol but nothing.   This will be the last time I come to this place. I made my way over to Zinc and was greeted and served within a minute. Glad I found a place who will take my money.",

It's almost good enough to want to schedule a lay-over in Phoenix just to get this burrito.  Filled with Oaxaca cheese, pork and green chiles this is a delicious piece of work.  I thought that the salsa was also excellent - nice flavors and spices without it trying to kill you in the process.    The service however, while good, wasn't great.  I had to ask for the salsa again after my food was served, and that took awhile.  Getting a beer was harder than it should have been, too.  The staff was super friendly and accommodating though, and that counts for something in my book.     The Barrio Cafe is hands-down the best place to get a meal in Sky Harbor - so if you are in terminal D, this place is worth your time!",

I have given Barrio Queen a chance even though the reviews were iffy at best and found out that Barrio Cafe at the airport could be even further from the original.   Staff sucked: now this may be because it's tough to get people to work at the airport so I will let that slide.   Food: Honest to God, I wouldn't serve this to my dog. I ordered the Tacos De Arrachera (Skirt Steak) and I am not kidding when I say this cow must have either been 70 yrs old or the chef has never grilled a skirt steak in his/her life. Unchewable and absolutely flavorless!   My girlfriend and I are always debating over the Original Barrio Cafe as to whether or not it really is that good. I think one thing they are good at is ambiance. Cool Urban Mexican Art can't make up for a shit show in this kitchen.",

    "text": "For airport food, this is pretty good. The prices are typical of airport prices but not crazy. I had a glass of wine and the steak tacos (3 tacos and french fries) and I paid about $23.00.  The service: I sat at the bar. The bar tenders were friendly, One Hispanic guy and a lady who had a lot of tattoos ( I don't remember their names lol). The guy was great. he was super friendly and helpful and just fun. The lady was a little more reserved; she seemed annoyed with one of the patrons but she wasn't serving me so whatevs. The guy who was serving me was helpful with suggestions and was quick with service.  The food: Eh. The tacos were alright; nothing to rave about by any means. They had steak, a cabbage slaw and pico on top. It came with a side of mild salsa. The fries were the best part. They are seasoned and steak cut. The menu is a good size but not a lot of variety.  The wine: great! hard to mess up Chardonnay.   Overall: If I was every in the airport again and wanted some mexican food I might stop here again. I don't think I'd spend that kind of money again on tacos though.  *shrug* I guess I won't be back.",

They came drowned, and I mean totally smothered, in goat cheese and some type of cream sauce. It was literally dripping when I tried to eat it. The salad had a very light dressing, but was unremarkable. The service was bad. I felt ignored because I was seated way in the back away from everyone when there were tables available elsewhere. Took my server 10 minutes to greet me, and he seemed shocked when I told Jim I was ready to order. Once my food came he never checked on me again. I placed my credit card on he table when I was finished to give them a hint I was ready to go. This just reinforced my belief that you can't get decent Mexican food outside of California. Sorry PHX! Still love ya tho...",

I ordered the fish tacos.  I think (and I'm not exaggerating) there was 1 oz. of fish in THREE tacos.  One was just batter.  And waaaaay over seasoned...think seasoned salt and Old Bay together.  Service?  Praytell, what's that?  I had to wave down my server after she was texting and later chatting with other servers.  Bottom line:  If you have time go to C gate (short walk) and you'll find TVs and better service.",

Here are a few things to note.: 1. if you care about the planet, request to get no straw with your drink. I hate restaurants that bring straws in the waters and other drinks that don't need one. Come on restaurant people, don't you know plastic waste is clogging our oceans? And you'll save money by only giving straws to those who requested one 2. Ask for your salad dressing on the side. I had tacos with a side salad, and there was so much dressing on it, it was in edible",

I have truly never dealt with someone who had such a large chip on their shoulder.   I originally asked the question of the server and told her I did not want to speak to the manager.  She sent him anyway.    I would suggest that she not have her manager intervene for her as he was not a good advocate but quite rude and condescending.   I would not suggest eating here.  LaGrange next door is much better in terms of quality and taste.   I understand it's quite difficult to find quality employees.  It's too bad this establishment has had to settle for someone who is not an advocate for customer service.  Approach makes all the difference.

The margaritas must have been good or the guys were thirsty because they tanked the first one and took it easy on the second.  Good customer service. We weren't rushed as all the business travelers were starting to pour in.   I thought my fried shrimp and fish dish was really good and it appeared my co-workers enjoyed their meals as well.  As we were leaving, as crowded as it seemed, we could still get through without tripping over the other customers with our hand carry in tow.  One thing I was mostly impressed with, the murals on the wall. Even my tatted co-worker thought it was tastefully done and fun.

Their prices are a bit extreme for just a snack, but the fresh-made guacamole sounded delicious, and was reasonably priced.  They prepare it table-side, and the anticipation of watching it being prepared makes it taste better. (True story)  It had large chunks of avocado, jalapenos, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, lemon juice, and is topped with pomegranate seeds.  One of the most amazing guacamoles I've ever had, and I have had, and made dozens of recipes.  I may have to head to the location outside the airport, and try one of their entrees.  If I spend any significant amount of time in the airport again, I'll certainly hit this spot again!",

I ordered the Chilaquiles Verde and when it arrived to the table: a few soggy, stale chips, with a few pieces of pork, and two bland eggs. Seriously, there was no flavor and barely any pork. The two stars accounts for the server who was nice and prompt, the coffee (pressed), and the decor. We killed some time but really should have grabbed a bagel and coffee, and saved the dollars.",

So I asked for my fries. They simply scraped the salad off the plate and plunked fries on top of the balsamic mess. My burrito was soggy, mediocre amount of chicken, and the vinegar taste was strong. Another thing I didn't like was that if you order takeout you cannot sit in the seating area. Dine in only. It's an airport. I don't have time to wait for someone to bring me a check when I'm trying to catch a plane. I'm not stopping here again. Pizza Hut probably would've been worth the walk...another note, the drinks in the cold case were warm so they had a bucket on the counter with ice. This ensured colder drinks but it was crowded and I almost pulled a muscle trying to lean over to get the drippy water on the other end of the counter.  I don't understand why the cashier couldn't have just handed me one as she saw me struggle. Just a negative experience all around. :( See pix.",

I often eat a late lunch here before I fly out, but each time I'm there the service is a bit slower, the hostess a bit more snippy.  Today was the last time I go here.  Many tables open, but hostess insisted on putting me in back of restaurant next to another table against wall.  When I asked if I could sit elsewhere so I didn't have people up on me, she said they need all the other tables for other people.  Maybe 10 tables open, and you need them all?  I said never mind, I'll eat elsewhere.  I don't do rude well, and rude and ignorant is really not good.

I ordered a shrimp quesadilla, and out came four small flat tortillas each topped with a single juicy jumbo shrimp, then covered in melted cheeses and super fresh pico de gallo. Everything was on point - the texture and home-made quality of the tortillas and chips; the slow roasted and marinated pork; the freshness of all ingredients, run out of the kitchen as soon as they were prepared. This place is better than any of the 5 mexican places in my small SoCal town. And it's in an airport. In Arizona. HUH? A bit pricey for what it is, and the wine by the glass is $10 a pop, but again, you're in an airport. If you want to eat well, it's going to cost you.",

First off, no frozen margaritas.  They're on the menu, but they were out?  How does one run out of traditional frozen margarita?  Pretty sure you take all the usual ingredients with ice and stick it in a blender.  So 2 members of our party left.  Then we get food.  Disaster.  I order the cochinita pibil (which I had the last time I was at Barrio Cafe).  Definitely not as good.  Didn't finish it.  Hardly ate it. Husband was served overcooked, dry, microwaved chicken.  We had margaritas on the rocks.  They tasted like salt.  Just salt.  They comped the chicken (after my husband complained), but we're not going back.

(Fyi my meal was cheap but everything else besides the tacos and burritos were spendy) The tacos were street taco sized but there were 4 of them and the salad serving was pretty generous. The salad was delish and I suspect a lot of it had to do with the cheese. It was unlike anything I've ever had. It's like a cross between a mild goat cheese and cottage cheese. The dressing was really light on the greens too which was great after a weekend of horrible eating. The tacos were really tasty too. On the salty side but the marinade was good and the pork was really tender. Topped with a pico de gallo and more of the cheese. I actually really enjoyed it. Though I ended up scarfing it down like a starving coyote since my first flight got in a little late and it took me a while to order. There is nothing else really for food in this terminal but regardless I would probably stop here again. I would just make sure I had more time to enjoy.  I should note I sat at the bar. This is not for the to-go window.",

The restaurant wasn't busy and a large number of employees socializing and ignoring us caused us to leave.  The last visit, we were seated and left at a table without being approached for almost 10 minutes. This seems unacceptable to me and we will probably not be back and we travel to Phoenix often.",

Came back and said $15 to double and I ask, each shot or for the flight?  She was confused. Then realized I ordered a flight and acted like I was the person in the wrong. Weird.   $27 for a flight of good tequila in an airport. Not bad. We had a quiet corner, Mexican coke, and pressed coffee too.   Can't comment on the food but be patient and CLEAR with the waitstaff.

I got the burrito (I forget what this one was called) and while it was good, I wanted something more from it. It didn't have anything exciting or different for me to mention. And I know it's airport food, but I was excited to eat in Arizona because I've heard so much about the food. I chose barrio fries on the side. There really isn't anything special about them. They are fries with spicy seasoning on top. For airport food, this is a great place. A little pricey but still decent.",

However, guacamole, enchiladas and fish tacos were all lacking some binding component to taste good. Guacamole was freshly made basically in front of us. That's nice. But I'd add more cilantro and onion to it.  Enchiladas had too much butter. Really, butter was all I could taste pretty much. Scampi shrimp on top of them was very good but I wish the dish had more shrimp and less butter. Fish tacos were rather bland, unfortunately.  The murals are pretty cool and the service is quick. Summary on the food - good house made ketchup and scampi shrimp, good guacamole, but everything else is on the blandish side.",

We told her we'd prefer to keep it with us and she said it was a fire hazard. She did let us sit at the end of the bar with the stroller after my husband asked. Then, while sitting there we saw a family leave with a stroller and one more family come in with a stroller. Ironically we're at an airport where you hear every 3 minutes not to leave your items unattended. Waiters was great! Manager needs to find some where else to work with her bad attitude!",

The server sat me with all my luggage towards the back left side of the restaurant where it was nice and quiet. I ordered the shrimp and avocado salad and enjoyed every bite. I can easily say avocados are my favorite lunch fruit/veg and they are not commonly served in airports!  When I got done with my lunch I was able to plug in my laptop and get some work done - what a pleasant surprise Phoenix airport had to offer me this trip! Thanks to Barrio Cafe for easing the burden of traveling just a little bit. My server was super nice and left me alone when she saw that I was working. When I needed to checkout she was quick to run my card and get me out to my flight.",

We kept thinking that we weren't that impressed with the food and prices last time; we should have listened to our gut. We ordered the guacamole and the cochinita pibil tacos (which they are known for). They first brought out the tacos piled high with fries, but we ordered a side salad. When they brought it back out, the side salad was so small. We were both shocked at how small it was. $14 for a taco platter and a tiny, tiny side salad is steep! The guacamole was not cheap either at about $12-13, and it had cranberries in it. Server was not very friendly. I recommend you go to one of the burrito/torta places in another gate area. It will be almost half the price.",

The server did bring us some crema Mexicana & Oaxaca cheese when we complained, but naturally the cheese wasn't melted. We tossed the cold cheese into our burritos.   My fries were decent for airport fries, and came with a spicy ketchup which I enjoyed. Our server was cheerful.   The cafe is in the D terminal and is convenient when flying Southwest.

And, if I had known the 'soft' corn tortillas would come basically raw and plenty hard, I would have had airplane peanuts for lunch.  The saving grace was the side salad. Great flavors.  Was it worth the $15 price tag? No. Next time, I'll walk down to A gates and eat at Blanco's Tacos & Tequila.",

That said,  I probably would have been far happier had time allowed me to go to one of their other locations.  I could sense a much higher level of cuisine when reading their menu than what arrived at my table.   I secured a table after a wait of less than 2 minutes.  Securing a server took quite a bit longer. There was a waitress who showed up after I had been sitting there for about 5 minutes but she walked right past me and proceeded to lean against a fixture behind me.  I turned around and asked her if she was my server.   She wasn't.  She didn't approach my table, didn't ask if she could be of assistance and didn't offer to find my server.  She just leaned.  I asked her to assist me with finding my server and she offered me a seat in her section instead.  I was settled,  my bags were settled... I just wanted to be introduced to my server.  With much reluctance, she finally pointed her out.  Thanks.   When my server was table-side,  I told her I can't eat jalapenos.  No problem - we can prepare almost anything you want without them.  I selected an enchiladas dish and asked if it could be prepared without jalapenos - she said the dish doesn't have jalapenos.  It arrived with something on  the side that looked a whole lot like it contained jalapenos.  Her answer: it's on the side,  you should be fine.  Should, huh?   I had the enchiladas with shrimp.  There were six small cheese enchiladas with a beautiful sauce and four decent size shrimp perched on top.  The dish was beautiful.  Sadly,  it arrived barely luke warm and the waitress vanished.     I could tell that this would have been a killer dish in one of their real restaurants  but it was flat here.  The sauce was creamy, cheesy and just slightly salty with that great mouth-filling taste that you get when you bring goat cheese to the party.  I wished I had a few tortilla chips to scrape up the remainder after I finished the enchiladas but chips don't come with the meal at this location.  The shrimp were cooked just about perfectly but lacked a scampi flavor as the menu had promised.  The tortillas were slightly hard around the edges... not sure if they were stale but it seemed likely.  I really, really wish that I had the opportunity to try their food in one of their real restaurants.  I don't know that I will be back in Phoenix anytime soon but getting to one of their real locations will be my first dining priority and I will do so with an open mind.  Unfortunately, and the other Yelp reviews bear this out, the only thing this location is doing is besmirching their good name among travelers.",

She took our drink order and thankfully gives us time to look things over for our food order.  When our waitress came back with our drinks, she joked that she didn't take a sip...ok...haha...but maybe she should have. My $10 original margarita was nothing more than water and lime. There wasn't even a hint of a taste of tequila in it. My husband's $14 margarita wasn't any better. For the cost, I shouldn't have to guess if the bartender remembered to put tequila in our drinks!  We attempted to find out waitress so we could ask for our drinks to be remade. She was no where in sight. In fact, we couldn't get anyone's attention.  Not willing to find out if our $17 tacos would be equally as bad, we left.  If you want weird and not great service, and terrible and terribly overpriced drinks--this place is for you!

Roasted tomatillo and poblano soup topped with shredded cabbage, sliced radish, and diced onion. What a fabulous choice. The large chunks of oh so tender pork, the spices, and the wonderful broth was off the charts. I added some hot sauce and bingo it went from a solid 8 to a 10.  This was one of my best airport restaurant experiences to date. I just wish I had a thick slide of coarse bread to sop up the remaining broth!!!! Service was great at the bar.

    "text": "Was headed out of town for the weekend and thanks for a flight delay I had some time to kill and thought it would be cool to check out what Terminal 4 has to offer now so I checked things and out and made my way on over to Barrio Cafe.   Ok one of the things I like about Phoenix Sky Harbor, they are supporting locally owned restaurants and bringing them into the terminals for others to enjoy, I think it's a great thing. <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fskyharbor.com%2Fpdf%2FTerminal_4_L3_Current.pdf&s=c40695cadfec99e521eaddda4b327b55375a00731fcc7973cad62f93d7cf8d40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">skyharbor.com/pdf/Termin...</a> I like the look of Barrio Cafe, the art work is cool.   I think there is a lot of improvement to be made with the hostess and there crew, when I 1st got there I told the host I was a party of one, she gave some other person a menu and told them to sit me at the bar table area facing the people walking to their gates,  walked me to the spot, put menu down and walked away, not once did they check to see if this chair belonged to someone else, maybe the drink should tipped them off, told the person whose seat I just stole I was sorry, walked back up to the podium and gave them back my menu, then they put me at a table for 4 with 3 other guest who didn't even know each other, and this was a bench seat, so I had to ask the man if he would mind moving the bench so I could sit down.  This was not cool, I was so very close to saying screw this shit I'm out. Since I was at table with a bunch of strangers I didn't know and room was limited my idea of reading my book while eating a meal was no longer available.  Barely had room for my purse on the seat because everyone but me had a carry-on bag. Also at the table next to me a man was sat there, and he waited for about 10 minutes before anyone came to him so he walked up the bar to order his own beer, but when he left his table the host put 2 people at it, he came back and saw no room for him anymore.   Our server was Victor, he was a friendly guy just very over worked, I even heard him tell the host not to place anymore people in his area until he can clear some tables.  Again this is something I shouldn't be hearing.  Ok so I had some time to check out Barrio Cafes web site while waiting and learned 2 things, supposedly this is truly excellent, very authentic Mexican food and BC notes on its website that its food is not deliberately chile-hot, wants the flavor of the seasoniongs & spices to revel themselves.  So don't expect heat, no chips no salsa either.  After looking the menu over I went with the burrito pollo pablano , it had grilled chicken breast with roasted poblano peppers, caramelized onions & garlic with goat cheese and a cream reduction and had the choice of salad or spicy French fires (because spicy French fries are way more authentic than beans or rice?) I picked the side salad, it was salad greens with diced tomato and goat cheese on top of it with a balsamic dressing, it was good, enjoyed the flavors.  The burrito though, I had high hopes, the chicken looked like the stuff you can get at the store, the deli fresh grilled chicken breast, it was perfectly sliced with grill marks, had no flavor at all, the peppers, onions and garlic was bland, no flavor, the goat cheese didn't have that bite it normally has, the cream reduction was like a thin alfredo sauce but bland. This entire burrito lacked flavor & spice and not the heat type of spice.  I wasn't impressed with Barrio Cafe , even if it was the airport addition and not sure if I would wonder on over the downtown Phoenix location .  And I really wanted to like it, So thrilled that Sky Harbor is putting in locally owned places, just think they missed when they added this one, but good news is Los Taquitos is almost done being built.",

I knew I was in for something special when the waiter brought the bread and sauce, a sublime combination of tapenade, caponata and salsa.   Then came the menu. Decisions, decisions. Should I play it safe and order a burrito or try something different and new? I chose the latter and went with the cochinita pibil, a slow-cooked (12 hours) pork dish served with mashed potatoes, a sort of pico de gallo, marinated cucumbers, tortillas and a little au jus on the side. Fan-freakin'-tastic.   Not sure why the other Yelpers on here gave this place such short shrift. If Barrio's other locations really are that much better than here, then this is the best Mexican \"chain\" on earth.   Worth getting to the airport early for!",

I ordered the table side guacamole for $12, so I guess since I was sitting alone I didn't rate the table side service. My server brought a bowl with the ingredients piled in it and proceeded to smash it all together with a spoon. There was so little avocado in the bowl that even after mixing and smashing it all together it still didn't look Iike guac.  So I ordered the shrimp tacos for $14, they were street taco size and I was surprised to see 1 fried shrimp in each taco, that's it! I understand they are small, but come on, I expected at least 2 shrimp per taco! To add insult to injury, each street taco had a huge slice of fat avocado on it.... Guess I know why my guac was so stingy... They save it for the tacos! Not my favorite, even though it's the airport, there are other choices....",

There's some serious chunks of pork in this soup! A little spicy and extremely salty but I mean, it's pork soup. Duh. My only gripe really was when the waitress placed had spilled soup from the bowl into the dish and I had to rescue a soup covered spoon before I could eat. I'm sure I could've gotten a new one had I asked but I just wiped it down. Other than that, $10 well spent at an airport.",

I love supporting local businesses and have been so pleased to see the arrival of so many to the airport but when I'm at the airport I must put efficiency first. This is where barrio Cafe sadly fails. In the future I will stop in for a drink but I will only sit at the bar and nothing more. This is because the service is sadly some of the worst I've experienced. On two separate occasions I've eaten here and both times the lack of service have almost cost me to miss my flight. After serving the food the wait staff seems to disappear and it's impossible to find them. I would ask and ask and then when I note my need to hurry for fear of missing my flight I have been snidely commented to by the staff. The food and drinks are good but I think the customer service and efficiency needs major improvement if they want to be successful in an airport environment.",

Ordered the Chilies en Nogada - a poblano pepper filled w/chicken,dried fruits, pears, apples in almond creme sauce. Execution is the problem, dark brown food in a nice soft pepper with light tan sauce and big red cranberries and dried cilantro leaves. Chicken was overcooked! Why didn't they use fresh cilantro? The favors could have been great but I think they are trying too high a scale of cuisine for the location. A smaller menu of all fresh food would not embarrass the chef/owner. P. S. Because of a 2hr delay, I tried the Flan, it was very tasty, but the strawberries were not ripe...",

The pork has a strange gamy flavor and I actually wondered if the eggs were real!?! Something was very off and totally disappointing. My kids had the pancake kids meals. They were fine.

    "text": "I am a pilot with an hour to kill before show time of my next flight. I opt to sit down and relax while I get some good Mexican food. That was nice. I order the $6 Jamaica. The waiter was very confusing when he called it the Jamaica flower water. I've never heard it called that way and it sounds more like a lightly flavor infused water like rose water or something ludicrous. Nope, the waiter just didn't know how Jamaica is made so it seamed normal to him to call it water and not more like sweetened iced tea of flore de Jamaica. Now that's out of the way I get the Arizona burrito.  After a few minutes I down the Jamaica and the food comes out. It looks great  and I ask for a refill on the Jamaica.  There are no refills. The glass was a 12oz glass with 8oz of ice. That is $1.50 an ounce for Jamaica. Are these managers completely nuts? It was good but outside of Manhattan I've never ordered something so expensive.  The burrito was very flavorful but again small for $13 then piled high with frozen steak fries.  So $20.58 for a burrito and Jamaica later I'm out of here never to go back. There are many other great dining options here in sky harbor. No need to stop here unless you are not hungry and you don't care what things cost. Note to the managers. An appropriate price for these would be $1.75 for the Jamaica (or have free refills) and $9 for the burrito. Out the door with tip $12.50. I was so overcharged by your prices that I did not include a tip. I hope you pay your waiters well",

I saw someone else commented on cold food so looks like they have a little problem. Also the waitress was completely overwhelmed and it wasn't that busy, but To her defense I think she was the only waitress in the whole place and she was hustling and very sweet. Overall... Wasn't bad and flavors were good and authentic, but when you say things like world famous on your menu it kinda sets the bar pretty high. If they hadn't I may not have been so disappointed.",

I can't fully review this restaurant as we were only served drinks.  The margaritas were good, not the best I've ever had but they held their own. Prices were ok, for being a Terminal restaurant, pricey for other standards. We were seated quickly and the hostess was nice. Our server came to the table some time later and we ordered two margaritas. My wife ordered the pink one and I ordered the spicier one, can't remember the names of them now as its been a few weeks.  The restaurant was busier so it took alittle time to receive our drinks and the server was ok. After we got our drinks our server went on her break, which isn't a problem at all, but the server that took over for her was absent. I mean, we never saw him/her. We would have had another round but after waiting 30 minutes with no server even after hitting the call button on the table we finally hit the Payment button. Still, no server, we finally had to wave another server down just to get our bill.  Overall I could do without going back to this spot, though the margaritas were good they aren't worth the wait.",

My server eyed me from across the bar, reading my impatience and immediately came over.  I had the carnitas torta (Mexican sandwich on a hard roll). with fries.  The pork was tender, super juicy, and bursting with flavor.  The bun was good but could have been a bit crunchier.  Fries were fresh and tasty, accompanied by spicy ketchup.  The Cadillac margarita was excellent.  Take this out of the airport and it would be a winner.  All in all, a good experience.",

It still takes 35 min for it because she said she forgot to put it in. The bartender (Teri) keeps busy. Then she starts hollering at the servers while I'm sitting at her bar. This is rude. She says how it's her first day back from vacation and she's struggling. That's fine, but be nice to your coworkers. The granola parfait wasn't that. It was a fruit plate with yogurt and a dusting of granola. Disappointing.   On another not there's an older gentlemen who seems to be her bar back. He does her job of making sure everyone's takin care of. He's nice. Made sure I had silverware because she only gave me a spoon. He makes small talk. He makes her money. I hope she knows this!",

The service was good and we found a seat at the bar right away, but for the price I was disappointed.   We ordered the Quesadilla Barracha (shrimp quesadilla), and it honestly didn't even look like a quesadilla. It was four little tortillas arranged in a circle, with one shrimp on each and some toppings in the middle. I actually saw the waitress walking over with it, but I honestly thought to myself \"I wonder what that is?\", because it didn't look at all like a quesadilla lol. The shrimp also had the shells on the tails, which was kind of weird and not that appetizing to see. Once we got the shells off and made them into little tacos, it was actually pretty tasty, but not very filling. For $16.50 I expected more.",

Next we got \"tableside\" guacamole that was not made tableside, and was so full of o ion it was inedible. Then the $16 quesadillas arrived. Just ew. Four smushy small tortillas drowned in broth of some sort, topped with four shrimp covered in Mexican cheese with a little pico de gallo in the middle. When politely brought to the servers attention, she did nothing, no apology, no attempt to replace, nothing. This is new after she disappeared for ten minutes and the manager didn't respond to my waving.   Update: the server did end up taking them off the bill, yay for justice!! But yeah, don't come here.",

I hope this one will help someone so they don't make the same mistake I did. My 3-egg omelette came out cooler than lukewarm and unedible. But the potatoes and toast were even colder. It came out very fast which would have been awesome if it was hot. I suspect they had premade it expecting a breakfast rush and it sat under a heat lamp for quite a while.  I asked for a replacement, which came out just as quickly (I don't normally complain about fast service unless they aren't actually fresh cooking my food). While the eggs did come out hotter, they must have given me the same potatoes and ice cold toast.  and once I started eating, it became obvious there was not 3 eggs in my omelette. Maybe 1.5. Lesson learned. Look for reviews. Avoid Barrio's. Normally I would eat before coming to the airport, but I'm on day two of what was supposed to be a 6 hour trip, so choices are limited.",

Well... Bland and distasteful... The meat had large chucks of hard inedible fat in it and lacked flavor. Even for airport food the Barrio Cafe is terrible. Service was mediocre the waitress was indifferent and preoccupied talking to her co-workers. I will never go here again. Even if this was the only place to eat I would rather go hungry until I land at my destination then eat at the Barrio....",

I had the burrito with chicken and goat cheese and all sorts of yummyness inside. I thought it was very good! Very close to the quality of the food at their original restaurant. The service was a bit slow for an airport place, but that means you have to get there a bit earlier. The BF had the pulled pork torta and really enjoyed his food as well. I would say the cons include: expensive, not enough space between tables for a place in an airport...need a little space for luggage etc, and the service is slower than fast casual places (obviously). The pros, however, include: The food is very tasty, the ingredients in my food tasted fresh, they have tasty margaritas, and you're in the airport and not eating at pizza hut.....Hopefully the kinks will get worked out at this location and it can be just as successful as the location on 16th st.",

The menu was rather on the small side, and while I THINK I saw it on some tables, I definitely didn't see it on the menu, and that is, chips and salsa. I dunno, maybe I have lived in El Paso for too long, but damn, chips and salsa? That's not even something you pay for, that's like automatic when you sit down... get with it Barrio.   This is one of very few places to eat in this particular terminal, so yea.. it was hella busy. But That is ok. We honestly didn't wait that long, and had 2 hrs to kill. So win-win I guess.   The menu was kinda small and kinda, I dunno how to put it, but it just wasn't like El Paso. If you've ever been to El Paso, you understand that its actually North Juarez. So yea, cant really get more \"Mexican\" than the Mexican food here... since we are in Mexico. Anyways.... I ordered some tacos, they were OK.. the tortillas was fried or cooked or whatever.. kinda weird. They did have a bunch of tequila on hand, and many travelers seemed to be enjoying that.   Here you go, here is where all 3 stars came from: The freakin double churro and ice cream dessert I ordered. O_M_F_G dude.... so I ordered this dessert, it was basically 2 (rather large) churros, with cinnamon and chocolate powder on top, with this inside made of melted caramel, they were HOT... and they sat on a plate next to a generous scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and fresh strawberries. Now dude check it... I have had churros, from japan (yes they sell them there in movie theatres) to Mexico, I have had some churros.... THIS, this random kinda ehhhh spot in a terminal at the Phoenix International (Sky Harbor) Airport... was the best churro dessert I have ever had. Honestly, the dessert alone was 4-5 stars, but the rest of the place 1-2 stars so it evens out at like 3.   I dunno, if you're in Phoenix, and in this terminal, why not try it out? But then again, why would anyone (voluntarily) be in phoenix?",

Food was EXCEPTIONAL. Pricey but well worth every penny. As others have said, their margaritas are terrible. Hard to figure how they can make a margarita so bitter and yucky. Maybe \"fresh\" lime juice isn't so fresh. Food was very very good and I will definitely seek out Barrio Cafe & try other menu items next time. TIPS: 1. Have 2 hours and take your time. It's not for someone in a hurry. 2. Ask for extra cilantro in your guacamole. 3. The shrimp is so GOOD and TASTY, ask to pay for extra shrimp. 4. Lastly, ask to taste the margarita mix BEFORE ordering or get beer.",

The only reason our server got a decent tip was we didn't have time to wait for change.",

I opted for coffee, which was sour and see-through but it got the job done.  The pancakes and bacon were actually very tasty, and I received 6 pieces of bacon with it plus fresh and hot maple syrup. I couldn't finish the plate and found it to be pretty tasty. However, $17 for pancakes and coffee is outrageous. I recommend any other place in the airport. In addition to the typical outrageous airport pricing, the service was mediocre. I don't need a bright, beaming ray of sunshine. I just need polite service without mistakes. Asking for a coffee refill seemed to ruin this waiter's day.",

I had flan and a strawberry frozen margarita. Both were fairly average tasting and a bit expensive ($12 each).  The booth was ripped in multiple spots and I waited 30 minutes after sitting down before someone asked me if I had been helped. Luckily I wasn't in a rush.    A plus, if you sit along the booth there are outlets so you can charge your phone.",

    "text": "I really appreciate having the option of sampling some local restaurants in an airport, rather than just the standard chain places.  Barrio Cafe is a restaurant in Phoenix, and this is their representation inside the airport.    I chose this spot because the menu items were interesting, slightly more exotic than the standard cheese quesadilla or fish tacos.  My guac was fine.  I was not a fan of the really thick chips, but I did think the dried cranberries were a nice twist.  My pork tacos were excellent.  The side salad was small and pretty much just lettuce, but fresh.  The bar style seating facing out towards the gates was great for people watching, and there are outlets at about every other seat.  The service was fast and friendly.  I like that they have those call buttons so you don't have to try to flag down your server to get your bill, but the device design could use some work.",

    "text": "I spend a lot of time in Phoenix Sky Harbor and in airport restaurants in general. The most important aspect to airport restaurants is that you have to provide prompt service, as your customers have a hard and fast deadline (e.g., plane boarding). For the fourth time in a row, I've had to essentially beg someone to serve me here, and then, after finally getting served, I have to beg them to bring me my bill. The push-button service call buttons must not be connected, as they don't seem to bring the servers to my table any quicker.   HMS Host, you do it right at all the other great restaurants in Terminal 4, including LGO, Zinc, and Humble Pie. I've never had an issue with any of those places. Why can't you figure out how to make Barrio Cafe work correctly?   Yes, the food is good -- once it finally arrives. Too bad I have to wolf it down to catch my flight.",

    "text": "I've been to many airport restaurants through the years as a business and personal traveler. This is on the better end of those eateries. The menu is fairly diverse and everything looks delicious, not warmed up in a microwave in back.  I was seated in a lounge area I hadn't seen when I was waiting for a table. I was the only one in the room for quite a while. There were two sofas, a high top table wrapped around a post and my high top. Two TVs were off and I overheard a waiter say one was broken. I was worried I would be neglected but my waiter made sure I wasn't.  I wanted a snack so ordered the nachos with chicken and a Cadillac margarita, rocks salt. OK, it was a bit heavy for a mid-afternoon snack but I had skipped lunch.  The nachos were good but the homemade chips were quite chewy, not crunchy. I found it a bit challenging to eat. The flavors were all over with bleu cheese, goat cheese, chorizo and a creamy cheese fondue. I liked the look of the dish more than how it tasted.  The margarita was super strong.   The menu has quite a bit and it's unique Mexican food so it's on the upper end of airport food. Even though I wasn't thrilled with my meal, I liked the ideas coming together and want to try more the next time I'm in Terminal 4, D section.  The discrepancy in reviews is amusing. Airplane travel is stressful and time is limited. Of course a sit-down restaurant like this with a higher end menu is going to take time or the understaffed wait staff will neglect people. Have to take the low reviews with a grain of salt.  I saw the tall beers and was envious of those who ordered them. Next time.",

Coffee was very bitter so I added all my creamer and still couldn't get rid of the bitterness. I just skipped it and drank water. Waiter did remove from my ticket and didnt charge me. Chiliquelies were interesting. Was more like 2 eggs on top of stew nachos on top of potatoes. Potatoes got soggy under the sauce of the stew. Pork green chili stew was flavorful but not spicey on top of tostada strips.  Wait staff was ok. Not super friendly. Didnt refill my water or ask if I needed anything else. It was not busy.  Overall was ok but bit pricey. I think next time I'll opt for the quick counter serve places than this sit down restaurant. Unless they have the pozole.",

It was truly a SW style restaurant gem.   Then, a few years ago the pressed coffee stopped.  And recently the portions have grown smaller with mixed quality. Now, you get a near shot glass full of coffee and I had to beg for a refill at 7am.   It's sad, as I can no longer say this is my favorite. I'll still eat here but the flame is gone.",

Fortunately Barrio Cafe was near our gate, so we stopped for a dinner break. I'm glad that they're dog friendly enough to let us sit at a table. Well, I sat at the table, and the dog laid on the floor... it's always nice when wait staff LOVE dogs instead of just tolerate them.   I ordered the Arizona burrito (apropos) and a peach margarita, then got a side of plain chicken for the dog. They were so sweet to do that for us. The burrito was filling and just the kind of food I needed after a long day of events and waiting at the airport. Oz the Husky wasn't too keen on the chicken until we got to the gate. Wiped out from the dog park, I imagine.    I paced back and forth in the terminal deciding what to eat and reluctantly chose Barrio. I'm paranoid about bad Mexican food, but it was a surprisingly wonderful experience with excellent customer service and tasty food. The margarita wasn't super strong, but I probably shouldn't have gotten something so sweet in the first place. Anyways, I hope never to be stuck at Sky Harbor again but would visit Barrio Care if I were.",

After 15 minutes, we informed the server that we needed to close out and the drink wouldn't be necessary as we were getting ready to board. The staff then still brought me another drink and rolled their eyes when I reminded them we needed to close out.   The bill was brought, and we demanded to speak to the manager. We informed him that as the drink could have caused serious bodily harm, we would not be paying our bill. The manager attempted several times to blame US for not going to him first, which we explained good customer service (e.g. the staff) should be reporting it to him, and were appalled he attempted to blame us. We again informed him we would not be paying, and he let us go.  Several minutes later, while we were boarding our flight, the manager grabs my husband out of line (as I had already boarded in an earlier group) and demanded my husband pay the bill. My husband refused and threw cash at him as he didn't want to miss our flight.  Your service and customer satisfaction is unacceptable and appalling. I would like to be reimbursed for your inability to train competent staff, for your disgusting behavior towards my husband, and for attempting to kill me.",

Very messy and the portions of meat, mushroom, spinach, and pico were very small. It was tasty but I didn't care for the presentation. Too difficult to eat nacho style. Might have been better if presented in typical layers on top of the chips with more of each ingredient. I think I identified two pieces of spinach and maybe one mushroom sliced up. Disappointing. Not worth the $16.75 in my opinion. I'm still hungry. Service was pretty fast though.",

It's the first time, in a long time I can say I enjoyed my meal at the airport. Even feel the price was worth it. I know, I know, it's just too good to be True. I can only vouch for what I had, but they did a good job.  The Pollo Poblano burrito was actually quite tasty, particularly the tomatillo cream sauce over the top. Side salad was fresh and crispy. My San Tan Devil's Ale was an excellent local brewery I had never tried before.  Service is average. I had to laugh when my server asked me if vinaigrette was okay on my salad. I responded \"What are my other options?\" To which she replied, \" That's all we have.\" Looks like I will have the vinaigrette.  My food came out very fast. So fast I can't help but feel like it was just precooked and quickly assembled for me, but again I did enjoy it. I find myself with a layover in this terminal frequently, and fully expect to visit this place again.",

    "text": "First off, in my estimation, there are very limited options for food at the Phoenix Airport particularly if your flight is in Gate D (where Barrio is) or Gate C. I can't speak to the other Gates. As someone who has frequently traveled through Phoenix, these are the Gates I usually end up in.   So, if you've had a long day of traveling and need a solid meal at a restaurant, Barrio Cafe proves to be one of your only options particularly when you are a vegetarian as well.  My most recent visit to Barrio was my third time there and I officially struck out. The first two visits were nothing special and I accepted it for what it was: overpriced food at an airport that I just need to consume because I have to eat something.   This time around I order the nachos but asked them to be vegetarian. First, the menu item itself is just a strange combination of a variety of items. I do not know which barrio tosses blue cheese with regularity in their nachos but that Mexican community is not getting represented well here. Blue cheese just doesn't match up with the other all over the place components to the nachos.   The presentation was just terrible. Tortilla chips tossed at the bottom, a suspect cheese sauce is on top, then just throwing everything else on it in sectioned off yet disordered ways. Grilled vegetables, blue cheese, jalapenos, avocado. The avocado so clearly was just scooped out and chucked onto the plate. There was just clearly no effort with it. It had the presentation of a Taco Bell Nachos Supreme but at least Taco Bell has the excuse of being fast food.  The taste was uninspired but I'd come to expect that from my previous visits to this location.   But what made this experience particularly terrible and dropped what would have been a 2-star review to 1-star is that these nachos definitely affected my stomach. I had to poop on my flight. I got back home, went to sleep, and within 30 minutes was awoken to my body immediately having to head to the toilet. Same thing happened over again. They should probably change the name of the restaurant to Bano Cafe. I don't know what it could have been in the nachos (my suspicion is the cheese sauce) but, when already not great tasting food ends up leading to a sleepless night and troubling stomach, that's a problem.   The service was fine but fairly indicative of the plate of nachos. The bartender kept ripping into the host who wasn't doing much of anything. She acknowledged being bored because it was dead. The other bartender wasn't doing much, either. In a sense, I wasn't clear who was on shift or off shift. But these kinds of things with service don't really matter to me if the food was good. It's just the cherry on top (that will probably make me go poop) of the experience at Barrio.   Obviously, I will not return. I think anyone is much better served to just getting prepackaged snacks from one of the stores or maybe even going to Panera Bread since that's at least a reliable chain where, one would hope, a bagel sandwich would not lead you to sprint to the toilet.",

The menu seemed to be over priced, even for being in an airport; with not many options to chose from or at least anything that sounded good.   My husband ordered an Arnold Palmer, and it came out super watered down. We didn't order any food, as we weren't finding anything on the menu that seemed to stand out. Our waitress wasn't very friendly, and kept touching my shoulder which I didn't appreciate.   It was a very uncomfortable and short experience for us.",

So your kids will be screaming/crying for mercy with one bite. And there's not even a warning... Just some idiotic \"our famous barrio browns\" in the menu description. Wake up and fire some CEO's please and fix your menu. Also the food was horrible. $30 at the airport for two breakfasts that weren't even as good as Mc Donalds or Burger king breakfast. You people should be ashamed. I didn't know that it was even possible to screw eggs, bacon and hash browns up this bad. My advice would be to avoid this place at all costs. A microwave breakfast burrito that has been frozen since Abraham Lincoln was born would be better. Run for your life.",

The food is way over priced. I got the roasted pork plate because when I asked any questions about anything else the server just told me it was the best (its also the priciest of the options I was looking at).  I originally wanted wine, but they were out of about half the options and I wasn't about to pay $15 for a glass of Mexican merlot.... My $12 blended margarita was semi runny but also hard to consume due to chunks of ice in it... I mean come on if you're going to over charge me at least give me something decent.  My meal arrived about 120 seconds after I ordered it... I think I just paid $40 for fast food (that zucchini could not have possibly been cooked fresh...)  Since I have been sitting here I have noticed rude staff (not necessarily to me but to others around me!) one of the gimmicks of this place I guess is that they make guac table side.... I straight up saw the host and a server get into an argument while the server was making the guac for a table next to me.  No one smiles. No one accommodates. And my corn tortillas stuck together and ripped apart :( :( :( very sad I wasted my money here.",

I was so happy to be seated at a bar and watching the game that they could have served dogfood and I would have been OK. Rest assured they did not serve dogfood. This wasn't as salty. I am kidding of course but the food was not memorable. Ordered the Torta Cochinita Pibil. It was a big sandwich of pork marinated in achiote and sour orange. That sounds great but it was rather bland. It was topped with pickled onion and pico de gallo. Those were nice but the strong flavor of the torta bread overpowered. The fries were decent and I enjoyed the spicy chipotle ketchup. Ultimately, the pork was underwhelming and a torta cannot recover if the star fails.",

I order the chilaquiles and when they come out, they look different from what I'm accustomed. I give them a try anyway as they do look appetizing. Turns out the tortilla was cold, almost as if it had been just pulled out of the packet. I ask the waitress if that's how the dish was meant, since I'd never seen chilaquiles assembled in this format and she said no and took it back. When she returns the tortillas were warm but my over medium egg was also now fully cooked. I ate 1/2 and then notice my potatoes have 2-3 small chunks of pork meat. Btw, I don't eat pork and the dish did no describe to include any meat. I confirm with the waitress again and her simple response was, it must have just slipped in.

Significantly overpriced for poor quality food is a pretty good summary. I even got sick one time within 20 minutes of eating. I wish D gates had better options, but I am guessing Barrio will be replaced in 2014.",

Anyway it's sounded great spicy chicken with grilled pablano, onions,  etc... I asked the waitress she went to the kitchen, only to come back and say it doesn't come with peppers or onions.  My response,  menu says it does. Well we're out of peppers, I can give you 10% off is that ok. No,  I didn't order a pile of chicken I'm a soggy burrito.  5 minutes late she comes back with a side of grilled onion,  peppers,  whatever else was supposed to be in the burrito.  It helps but I'm annoyed and the meat is cold at this point.  Whatever,  I have a flight to catch,  I just paid my tab (no discount), I'm done and never coming back.",

First of all the service I received from both the manager and my server was some of the best I have had. After being seated, the manger stopped by to see if I had any questions about the menu, which I did, and he proceeded to go back to the kitchen and show me the type of chip they use for their nachos. While my daughter and I were waiting for our food, he brought her out a thinly sliced apple without me asking for anything. The nachos were different than I have ever had, and were awesome! Their pork is delicious and the sauce, yes sauce, for the nachos was super good. I wish they had a Barrio in Seattle because I will be craving these nachos!!",

I watched them pour more Grand Marnier than tequila into the tin and then squirt about 3 times more cheap sweet and sour juice into the tin. Her shake was pethetic. She gave it one up and then one more. She looked scared like she was holding a soda that may have been shaken around. Being a Mexican restaurant and the margarita being the most popular cocktail in the world you'd think they would have it down, especially for $13 each! Food is very average! For the money they charge and the quality of service you're better off going to a different terminal and eating anywhere else I promise you. If the food was average and the service was at all passable I would give this a 3 star but they really go out of their way for piss poor all around. I won't be back.",

I think my favorite thing here is the Mexican Cafe. It's a rich full bodied coffee with complex flavors served to you fresh in a French press. I've emptied it every time I've had it! I get it even if I'm flying home at 11p. I risk being up all night just to enjoy the great cafe!  If you're at the Phoenix airport on a long layover or just want a bite to eat, go to Barrio Cafe! Make sure you get the coffee!  They also have a large selection of Mexican tequila. I'm always in Phoenix for work, so I've never had any of their tequila samplers myself...",

Service by loud, tough Asian lady and snot-nosed kid was horrendous. The latter slammed the food down and left without giving one of us silverware. Had to walk down one of the waiters.

While waiting for a Southwest flight (like everybody else here), I ordered the \"Arizona Burrito\" which was on the small size and not adequately heated. This came with either fries or a small salad. I opted for the salad, which was made with mixed greens and chopped tomatoes. The salad was just OK - a little heavy on the dressing. But the biggest problem was that the Arizona Burrito didn't come with any cheese or crema. These were clearly on the burrito's description on the menu! No Oaxaca cheese or crema Mexicana at all. The waitress was nice and brought out some cheese and crema on the side, but it just wasn't the same! Any other restaurant would have had the manager come to the table.   Another big problem has to do with the general atmosphere at this Barrio Cafe. It felt like the workers and waitstaff were not too serious about their jobs. They were pretty casual about everything - too much goofing off. This is clearly a problem with management.   I won't be dining at the Barrio Cafe in the future. My food was just OK, made incorrectly, and way overpriced for what you got.",

We were greeted and seated immediately. The staff were really friendly.   The place is very artsy and there were art works from Pablo Luna. You can buy some of his artworks as there were prices.   We were really hungry and the food we ate definitely hit the spot! We live in San Francisco and usually prefer eating authentic Mexican foods in the Mission district.

This airport extended location will get you the basics with the limitted menu.  The guacamole made fresh is one of their signatures. If you cant decide between tacos and something else choose tacos.   The service at this location is great. One of the people in our party asked for ranch dressing which they dont have. The manager went to the resteraunt next door and got it with no questions asked even though we told him it was no big deal (props to la grande orange).  If you're in Phoenix go to the original location, if you have a layover in Terminal D go here.",

I've found myself at this bar twice now, and each time the margarita has been stellar (premium tequila, freshly squeezed lime juice, agave nectar, and Cointreau floater). Can't speak for the food, but the dishes that went past me looked tasty.  Special shout-out to the bartender who 86'd the drunk dude sitting next to me (he was already 6 beers deep!). That's not an easy situation to be in, and she handled it like a pro. I pity the folks who had to sit next to him on the plane.  Prices ain't exactly cheap (I believe my drink was around $12), but I guess that's pretty standard for an airport bar/restaurants. That being said, the Barrio is still a fun place to pass the time before boarding a flight.",

But the counter person realized this pretty quickly and went to find my shrimp tacos as soon as she saw that I was still hanging around.  Four shrimp tacos and a bottled water for $16 seems about right for airport food, and this food was good!  I even liked the seasoned fries, and I rarely like seasoned fries.  I'm going to keep this one on my list since I actually seem to hit the Phoenix airport a couple times a year.",

I ended up ordering some kind of veggie sandwich, which was okay.  It came with this delicious yellow sauce that made the sandwich edible. I was told that it was tomatillo sauce- yea, I'm pretty sure that was inaccurate.    What was disappointing about this place was how unwilling they were to accommodate your dietary needs.  No substituions or changes... you order what's on the menu. That's it.  And no salsa or chips to start-- I was told they didn't even have traditional salsa in stock... Rather rude staff too.  And, of course, prices are quite inflated to properly exploit your hunger during your airport visit.  I encourage you to bring some snacks before going to this airport.",

Barrio Cafe was right next to my gate, so I decided to go for it even though the prices were a little high.  I was seated quickly next to an older couple, and shortly after I was settling into my seat they had an appetizer delivered. I asked them what it was, because it looked quite good, and found out it was the tecate breaded fish and shrimp. I was tempted to grab it for a meal, and thanked them for letting me know.  I perused the menu. No server came by.  I plugged in my phone at the A/C outlet next to the table. No server came by.  The couple next to me finished their meal. No server came by.  The couple requested their check and their waiter dropped it off, then turned and walked away. No server asked if I had been helped.  The couple next to me paid their check and asked \"Has anyone even gotten you a drink yet?\"  I checked my watch. It had been 15 minutes since I was seated, and I had 20 minutes before my flight was supposed to start boarding.   I stood up to leave. The waiter who had come by to collect the check from the couple next to me asked how my meal was. I told him I didn't know, since no-one had ever taken my order.  He asked if I wanted to sit back down. I explained to him that I was concerned about missing my connecting flight, and that I really just wanted to get some lunch  quickly.  Instead of letting me go, he gave me a rather nasty look and said \"Well, if THAT'S the way you feel, SIR, maybe you /should/ go somewhere else.\"  I'm very, very glad I didn't give them my money, and if I'm going through Sky Harbor again, I don't intend to ever return.",

When I ordered the chips and salsa, the waitress told me they cost $9, and if they were actually edible I would say OK. However, this was a huge waste money. I even tried soaking the chips in the soup to soften them up, but that didn't really work. I left nearly the entire bowl of chips. I walked out of there feeling totally ripped off.

    "text": "Had a friend recommend this place to me while I was in town on business.  He mentioned that Sky Harbor is attracting great chef-driven operations to place their restaurants in the airport.  But he thought I wouldn't be able to get to Barrio Cafe because it was only available behind the D Gates (Terminal 3) security check and I was going to Terminal 3, but was behind the US Airways security check (B Gates.)  I figured that sounded wrong, and had 3 hours to kill before my flight so I started exploring.  To my surprise, I found that I could make the long hike, and after about 30-45 minutes of horizontal escalators, a cappuccino from Cartel Coffee Lab, and a near-taco purchase at *another* place, a dude drove by on one of those people carriers and offered me a lift.  2 minutes later and I'm standing ten feet from Barrio.  First, had to wait about ten minutes to get a seat.  I could've sat immediately in the bar, but needed to do some work on the laptop.  Finally got a seat, and perused the menu.  It was short and sweet...and a bit expensive.  Average price around $15 for a plate of tacos, etc.  Specials over $20 each.  I order the Cochinita Pibil tacos with fries.    The tacos were amazing.  Two or three homemade corn tortillas around each helping of juicy pork.  They left the pork nude and let the arbol/sour marinade and slow-cook do the flavor work.  Then they top it with their pickled onions and a habanero sauce and pico de gallo,...or was the habanero inside the pico de gallo?  Either way it was hot, perfectly cooked juicy pork, and exploded with flavor.  They also give you this side of \"yellow\" salsa.  I try some of it on my 3rd bite.  Their chef knows what's up.  The yellow was a cooling agent, that basically cleanses the palate and cools your tongue for the next bite.  Balance and complexity like this is hard to find.   Three tacos later and I am fully satisfied and very impressed.  I couldn't finish the fries, but they were crispy, hot, and lightly salted with what I'd imagine was arbol powder or maybe just cayenne and salt? (I forget)  While the dish was expensive, the portions were generous and the quality was well worth it.  If this was the airport location, I can't wait to try their original storefront operation when I'm back in town.",

However, they still served pancakes and it was delicious just like the server said it would. (: overall cute place to sit down and eat/drink.",

The enchiladas, which are tightly rolled in crusty tortillas and are consequently more like flautas, are outstandingly creative and delicious.  The rest of the fairly small menu is also up to snuff.  The only catch is, the service, especially the taking of orders and, even more, the bringing of the check, are on the leisurely scale of a sitdown city restaurant, not of an airport.  If you have less than about 100 minutes till your flight, then FORGET IT.  Don't eat here: you'll expire of a heart attack while fretting over whether the bill will come before your plane starts boarding.  But the food is good enough to make it worth arranging a long layover, or coming here from another pod in the same terminal, at least.",

My breakfast sandwich was absolutely average and exceptionally messy given the fact that you are likely going to be eating it off your lap.  The bread was heavy and bland; I wound up discarding it.  One general complaint about the overall new restaurant plan.  I am absolutely a fan of the local restaurants in the airport but as I was in the Southwest terminal I couldn't find any reasonably priced dishes.  I find that interesting given the fact that the Southwest terminals are usually ground zero for families and young kids.  I feel bad for the mom of 4 who has no option but to spend $15 for some french toast at Barrio or LGO.  What happened to  the cheaper options?",

This time around not so good....I was hungry and Taco,s sounded great, one of the offerings that looked great were chicken tacos covered in a cilantro lime sauce and cheese....YUMMY!!! Not so much, the waitress was sweet and friendly, but the Tacos were tough and chewy...pre made, seemed frozen and reheated.....reheated to the point that the cheese was glued to the plate, chicken dense and thick, and the tortilla shells would crack your teeth if you had ok dental hygiene. The crema and sauce were yummy....not enough to save the dish...  After eating the edible portions that would not crack my teeth, I asked for the check and showed the waitress how tough the tacos were by smacking them with my fork, I asked her to do the same and she did and agreed, I asked her to tell the chefs not to overcook them for other customers.  She returned with my check and stated \"I told them\" with a worried look, and nothing else....I tipped her well as she deserved, and I left...I guess what I have to rationalize is....\"well....it is only airport food\"",

The manager was nice and apologetic, but nothing was comp'd and our meal with 2 drinks each cost about $75, not including tip.

This place was a delight on my palate, the michelada mix was authentic and full of flavor, they had to have used ground red dehydrated chile in the mix and on the rim; totally worth having two! My wife ordered the green pozole woth a tomatillo base, I thought it was going to be tangy and water (True to airport style food) and I was absolutely wrong, the caldo (soup) was delicious, hearty and absolutely full of flavor; the prok was tender and garnishes were the cherry on top. I had the green chile pork burrito which was also really good, they top off the burrito woth extra green sauce which made it even better. Wasn't too spicy which is normally a downfall for me but becauae the burrito and chile verde weren't lacking on flavor there was jo need for extra salsa. For an airport restaurant this was and will be one of my top picks! I understand people complaining about price, but get over it, you're in an airport and everything you buy past those tsa lines are going to be way over priced, so sit back and enjoy your overpriced beer and fairly priced airport meal. Our server was also attentive, friendly and brought us everything we needed before we even asked. :) happy airport hopping people",

Spoke with the Manager and he stated that he gets this complaint a lot and that I should have said something when it came out. Only thing is, is that this dish comes out stacked , so how are we suppose to know if there is no meat before eating some to get to that point. Also, it was obvious there was still a lot left on the plate when we returned it. I noticed other complaints about meat portions as well. Wish I had of read reviews prior to coming here.

I was greeted immediately by the pleasant hostess who seated me right away. My server was super kind and helped me with any questions I had, giving suggestions along the way.  I ended up getting the fish tacos and I'm so happy I did!!! The plate had 3 tacos stuffed full with fried mahi mahi and avocado on corn tortillas. It came with a lovely side salad with delicious balsamic vinaigrette.  Great service! My water glass was always full. My empty plates were promptly cleared. My check was brought immediately when I asked.",

I don't read reviews until after because I like to find out for myself. My husbands chilaquiles were watery/soupy with egg on top and no flavor. My plate (chorizo/eggs)... the chorizo was super salty and the eggs had no salt so I mixed it up. I tried everything available to me but there was no fixing our plates. They were not good at ALL. This was by far the worst breakfast I have ever had. We tried to force ourselves to eat it and it was unbearable. I figure we got a bad batch of food or people who give it such a high rating just don't know any better. They're starving or don't know Mexican food at all. The waiter, Matthew, was very attentive etc. He's the only reason I'd give a decent rating but if I could give no stars for the food and the flavor and anything that revolves around that, it'd be ZERO stars.",

Neither was bad, but I wouldn't eat here again as I was not \"wowed.\"  The French fries were blah. The tacos were meh. The best part about our meal was our adult bevvys (cold and refreshing).   Honestly, I've never had more mediocre food. I expected more from Barrio Cafe, but I won't be back again.    I look for oomph or at least a mouthful of flavor when I'm eating Mexican food.

Waitress did not mention the iced tea was flavored, we took two sips and sent it back. We replaced the tea with Diet Coke & water. We ended up being charged for the tea we sent back plus the Diet Coke. (We should only have had to pay for the Diet Coke). Refills and seeing our waitress again were out of the question. At one point we took the empty Diet Coke up for a refill & were told by the bartender he was too busy to refill the Diet Coke, we would have to wait on our waitress. If our waitress was accessible, we would not have been at the bar asking for a refill. Who does that?! Definitely not a team atmosphere with the bartender.   We never did get the refill on the Diet Coke, we finally got refills on the water from another waitress after we went back to the bar to grab the water pitcher ourselves to fill it up.   My meal was messed up from the start, I ordered shrimp enchiladas, they brought me chicken enchiladas. All at the table heard me order shrimp not chicken. Waitress said she would get it fixed. Waitress never returned to our table after this. We waited forever, finally it was getting too close to my boarding time, I had to flag down the manger that seemed VERY indifferent to the service provided. The manager brought my bill out with the tea charged on the bill, tea that had been sent back, and offered no apologies for the service, messed up meal etc. I got on my flight without dinner and extra charges on my bill because I didn't have another 30min to wait on them to get it right   The service was 100% unacceptable. I don't know if this restaurant feels they don't have to provide a quality experience since it's in an airport, but they will never see my credit card again. My advice....keep looking.",

The decor is not bad considering we're in an airport, and the volume level is louder than most areas due to everybody being compacted in a small area and drinking beers.   Our server was Lori. I wasn't too impressed with her. She was all business and it was clear that she was only there to take our order and fill our drinks. The restaurant was busy as it was lunch time, but it doesn't take much to smile and pause an extra second or two.   I ordered the chicken quesadillas. I was expecting a quesadilla in the traditional sense of two tortillas with cheese melted in between. What I got was more of a street taco with melted cheese and chicken on top. 4 small tortillas with 4 small pieces of chicken. NOT worth the $16.50 we were charged. The food definitely was flavorful but unfortunately the service just made the whole experience very bland.",

The server, Jane,  was fantastic - completely on top of it, and had our order and ticket out quickly as she knew we were in a hurry. But the food was just not good. I chose the special, the Burrito Arizona, which arrived an uninspired lump which tasted like salty pot roast. Nothing special about that. The side salad (I thought it was odd to have a choice of side salad or fries with a burrito, but i went with it) was just old. The leaves were wilted and starting to scum over, and no amount of dressing could hide that. And while the guacamole itself was good, the chips served with it were stale.   We ended up downing our beers and picking at the food. I might have complained had I had more time, but alas, we had a plane to catch.   Good thing Southwest gave me extra snacks once on board.",

The cup was filled with approximately 80% ice. While this would simply cause me to never visit the restaurant again for providing little value in the equation, I write this review to warn others of a more egregious problem. When I asked the waiter for a refill, he asked if I wanted to purchase another drink and I said no, I simply want more as the cup was mostly ice and for $6, I expected more. He argued that he did not set the amounts nor was he responsible for establishing the price.   Perhaps, my expectations of adequate service in this day and age are not realistic but to have a business operate in this way with their customers seems right down nasty! While the general discourse in our society sinks deeper in the gutter, one would expect for a business that relies on customers frequenting their establishment, the common sense approach would call for a decent treatment even if there's a disagreement on the value one receives. While I know competition is limited at an airport and I know there are many out there like myself, I will never shadow their doorway and surmise many that have a similar experience will rather opt to starve.",

No said we'll be right with you after I'd already been sitting 10 minutes  If you're going to bitch about your customers, maybe choose not within their hearing range?!?

I opted for the bar as the ambience was very cool and they had a great selection of tequilas (passes on the tequila this time around, but it was enjoyable to scan everything they have).     I was greeted promptly and also served some complementary bread and tapenade.  I'll admit I have never had this combo before at a Mexican spot, but it was very good.     After looking the at the fantastic menu, I went with the seafood enchiladas.  They came out within 15 minutes.  3 good sized enchiladas with nice portions of crab, shrimp, and small scallops!   The flavors and textures were phenomenal.  There was a mild cheese along with goat cheese inside of the enchiladas - didn't make the dish heavy at all and the goat cheese added a nice tang.  It was also served with a side of veggies which paired great with the cheesy main dish.    Everything was pretty much perfect with regards to this experience.  If you decide to go with this dish, make sure you like goat cheese.  They put a good amount of it in the enchiladas.     Can't wait to head back to try another dish soon!",

The chilaquiles were just eggs on top of hard chips with little sauce and my french toast was underdone. The bacon was so burnt it was inedible. What were they doing with the 40 minutes. I asked the waitress to bring me the check and I'm still waiting for her to pick up the check so we don't miss our flight. It makes me never want to sit and eat in the airport again.

    "text": "It's always a nice surprise when you get through TSA without the humiliation of a body cavity check and find yourself with an unplanned extra half-hour before going through the routine of lining up for your Southwest Airlines flight. At least that's what spurred me on to give this cafe a try. I usually skip airport eateries since my track record with them is dismal worldwide. Take a look at my list if you don't believe me (list: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2c4CL6X&s=efdefc285b93fae2babaefc0e4e1edd744d3fe9d02584bd5a712e624eb566c50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2c4CL6X</a>). This one appears quite popular as I must have tripped over at least three roller suitcases on the way to my tiny table.  Getting the server's attention was the biggest challenge since everyone looked like they were getting ready to take off. I didn't have time to have lunch at the office since I tried to squeeze in too many meetings before getting to Sky Harbor. Airport prices are a bitch but what the hell since I was expensing it anyway. I decided to order the $9.75 bowl of Posole Verde, which combined bits of pork, hominy, roasted tomatillos and poblano peppers into a nice broth and topped it with shredded cabbage, sliced radish, and diced onion (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2c4DwwD&s=7b8bcef91ef744eaa170ac2c34938cb8fdc75567ec561687f5d975f04858869f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2c4DwwD</a>).  It was one of the better soups I've had, certainly at an airport terminal. I followed that with the $14 Tacos de Pescado, a trio of Tecate beer-battered fish topped with shredded cabbage and avocado slices, drizzled with a Baja aioli, and accompanied by a tiny side of baby greens (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2cxjFWm&s=7d39c94acf193d4a10c0117e8fab0799335f4f5597d56a6f52dc57e805ca0196\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2cxjFWm</a>). They were pretty decent for bar bites but honestly not much more than that if you're expecting something close to your favorite taqueria. Anyway, I'm just glad Phoenix Sky Harbor has one decent dining option in Terminal 4.  FOOD - 3 stars...posole was good and flavorful, the fish tacos less than stellar AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...it is the airport so guard your toes against aggressive travelers who pull their roller suitcases with indifference SERVICE - 2 stars...he disappeared when I needed to get going TOTAL - 3 stars...airport eating is a dicey proposition but this one is a cut above",

My chorizo was burnt to a char and it was supposed to be the star of the dish.  The redeeming factor was the sunny side up eggs. -  Incredibly expensive for what you get.  We get it, it's an airport.  But when you're paying close to 15 dollars for a plate of two basic eggs you're getting shafted. -  Slow service for food, quick service for drinks.",

I was very disappointed do not recommend them at all. Very small one shrimp on each taco, no flavor. I had to dump Tapatio and it still tasted like I was just eating corn tortilla with fried batter. Anna did offer me something else but I didn't have time to wait for them to make something new. I had to catch my plane. The star is for Anna",

It is pricey compared to most of the other food options in the terminal. However! Did you know that all the restaurants in most US airports are all owned by the same company, it allows it to fix the market and keep all the prices high once you pass through TSA.  An absolute crime in my opinion.  This place also has a nice grab and go menu if you're in a rush.  Safe travels!!",

I kept having to ask for a refill all the while my cup being visually empty and within eyesight and we were only 15 mins into just being here not even received our food yet(I just happened to be thirsty). Only some of us had silverware and no napkins. A customer from another table tried to ask a waitress for something and before the server gave her any attention the server said \"yeah, I'll be right with you\" the server walked behind me and said \"Jesus\" rolled her eyes and kept walking. Pretty unprofessional to say those things within earshot of other customers. It makes me think that even though I'm paying not only for my food but for their service and what I have to say is not important and that I, as a customer am not important enough to be heard.",

Bread wasn't fresh and required some shearing strength to complete the only bite i took.  Went looking for salvageable contents - chicken breast was thin sliced in half, no flavor. Bunch of onions that i carefully read the ingredients to avoid. Steak fries were cold. Spicy ketchup was the best thing on the plate.  I'm writing this review from next door at La Grande Orange where I'm enjoying the well reviewed Kale salad... Should have listened to my fellow Yelpers and saved $33 wasted next door.",

The food was excellent, not too spicy but enough spice to linger throughout and cause a few sniffles. It was a generous helping of meat with sauteed onions, tomatoes, garlic and fresh cut jalapenos (not pickled) served with steak fries and the house salsa and spicy ketchup.  I'm a native Phoenician, and I've been missing proper southwest flavor since I moved to northern Cali and this delivered while I waited for my flight back home. It's a little pricey, but it's airport food and I am leaving satisfied, so I'm not going to subtract for that.  Apparently this restaurant has been around in south Phoenix for a while, I'm going to make it a point to stop in next time I'm here.",

My server (well, most of the female servers) was inattentive, bringing me a refill for my drink when I was clearly finished with my meal, and all of the women seemed to congregate near the kitchen or next to the bar to chat and joke.

    "text": "Yes, I am the traveler who seeks - even during airport layovers - to maximize the culinary adventure. Because I don't know who doesn't need a fresh meal and a stiff drink while slogging across almost the entire nation in nine hours....  Things one needs, then: a fresh meal. I know airport-fresh should be flitting around here in air quotes, but it helps in that case to avoid any of the million ready-to-eat burrito joints in favor of somewhere you actually sit down and order from a menu. A good sign of such a place is guacamole mashed and made tableside: no sleight-of-packaging there. Another good sign of such a place is an external presence elsewhere in the relevant city; reputation matters a bit, insofar as it sets up comparison, expectation, and perhaps a bit of consistency.   And then there's the stiff drink. My flying preference is a margarita: a little salt to help you retain water and avoid dehydration, a little sour to wake up your tired mouth, and a little citrus to freshen your mind. And the only acceptable sign in an airport for one of these is that you're ordering it within the confines of a Mexican restaurant (by which I don't mean Chili's Too).  Barrio Cafe it was: a pretty good choice if you have a bit of time to kill, and similar standards for how to best slay it. While much of the menu is too pricey for an airport terminal (it'll be a cold day in Arizona when I'll pay $22 for an airport meal of anything), there are tacos, tortas, salads, and soups like posole for much cheaper. Plus the tableside guacamole, which looked lovely and which you can slightly customize to your preferences. I went for one of the tortas with avocado, cotija and queso fresco, all spread over a huge split-and-splayed poblano pepper. This isn't a buttery melty torta, but it was nevertheless so big I had to take the face off and eat it with knife and fork. Americanized? Yep, but good, with plenty of nice rolling heat from the poblano in every bite.  And the margarita was perfect. Seriously, that alone is worth a visit even if you're not hungry; it was all I wanted in a little salty, lime-y glass, and was better than many a margarita I've had at Mexican restaurants nowhere near an airport terminal. I only had the basic version, but if you're feeling a little spendier they had several variations that looked quite tempting.  Very friendly service too; I was impressed by how knowledgeable my server (Brianna, I think) was when suggesting wine to other customers. I noticed because, let's face it, wine pairings in an airport aren't usually a top priority, but she was informed, attentive, and patient. And to top it all off, the music in here was Gipsy Kings: a nice change-of-pace and something that added just a touch of perceived sophistication to my meal.  Phoenix SkyHarbor, you're off my misery list. Now let's just get some signage in the airport so people can find Barrio Cafe without having noted the location the night before....",

However......This one star was for the service and the guacamole.  My fiance and I happen to have noticed that we were sitting next to a semi-famous rock musician at lunch (yes, here at the airport). No big deal to us, really, but our server became VERY star-struck when he noticed and was so giddy and distracted. He lingered at the rock star table, and was trying to engage him in conversation constantly. It was really annoying and our service suffered big time.   The guacamole on the menu stated it was made table side by your server, which is always awesome, so we ordered it. Needless to say we were VERY surprised when our shameless server boy quickly dropped off a small bowl of Pre-made guacamole instead of fresh guacamole made table side. Ohhhhhh K.......It's also covered in pomegranate seeds. Not exactly easy to eat as the seeds are not meant for consumption (just the red juicy part around them). It was straight up sour! Soaked in lime juice, and absolutely salty. Disappointing and gross.   I think a restaurant that advertises expensive table side guacamole should actually MAKE table side guacamole. That way there's no chance of F'ing it up with too much lime or funky pomegranate seeds. I also think focused, attentive waitstaff is a must. Barrio cafe just doesn't cut it. Get a better overpriced meal further inside the airport terminal.",

    "text": "Warning, don't go to this place if you're looking for good authentic Mexican food. This place is terrible. I was happy when I got seated right away but only to find out why. Food taste like it's from a can bought from a low end grocery store. They don't serve complimentary chips. It will cost you at least $9 and they are pretty bad. I ordered posole and it tasted like something out of a can. Maybe my expectation is higher than average but I don't think so.  The only good thing are the people serving. They are professional and nice. The cook and management should be fired. Terrible terrible terrible!  Go somewhere else.",
