The pizza, sandwiches, salads, and appetizers keep me coming back for more. My family and I are OBSESSED with their French fries from the appetizer menu. We love them so much we call them \"crack fries.\" We always ask for extra aioli because it is the best! I love the pizza and the fresh taste of the sauce. So delicious, and always perfectly cooked. I always look forward to coming back to Humble Pie and trying something new, or sticking to my favorites.",

Okay, so not wanting to cook or grill on Memorial Day my husband & I decided to go out. The restaurant that we went to first had a small parking lot with no spaces left. The restaurant that we went to second was packed with only outdoor seating. So, the universe must have wanted us to try Humble Pie again and I'm glad we did. My husband had the mushroom pizza, he added sausage to it and said it was better than The Parlor. I ordered the grilled provolone tuna sandwich which was outstanding. It's a wee bit salty, but I like salty.  I was debating whether or not to deduct a star because of the subpar service we received from our waitress. No smile. No refills on water. No questions regarding our meal.",

We were seated quickly upon arrival, promptly served drinks, and within about 5 minutes we had placed our orders.   We ordered 4 different pizzas and some side salads from the lunch special option. The Cesar salad was great and my wife had no complaints with the chopped.  Solid serving size and out quickly.   I got the meat lovers pizza, wife got the BBQ chicken, my son had pep and cheese, and mother in law had the goat cheese and tomato. All pizzas were served hot, fresh, and at one time.   I tasted all four and I would say in my preference order it would be: meat, BBQ, pep, goat. The goat cheese was very good just not my cup of tea. No complaints from this entire visit.   The place looked great, staff was friendly, and food matched the pair. Very pleased and we will be back.",

So, when we went here w/our kid and saw it, we thought, \"Maybe they have it on the kid's menu.\"  To our delight, it was there.  Then, when our child's dinner came out, to our HORROR, it was KRAFT MAC & CHEEZE.  Yes, people, it was that orange pasta...dry and not creamy at all.  My kid was hungry and our food hadn't come out yet, so we didn't send it back, but mostly, I think I was honestly in shock for the next few hours about the whole situation.  Thank goodness he didn't eat much of it anyway (because it sucks!).  Red Robin has better mac & cheese for kids and that's not saying much.  Hello Humble Pie...KIDS ARE PEOPLE TOO.  Why not serve the good stuff to little ones???  At the least, if you are going to continue to serve shitty food to kids, please make that clear on your kid's menu so we adults can make informed decisions....i.e., \"this is the crap...er...kraft mac and cheese, not the good stuff we serve to adults.\"  Thank you.",

We waited and waited for someone to greet us. There was only 1 other table    with customers. The young waiter with the long puffy hair and backwards red hat came over and chatted with them several times, looked over at us and kept walking.    We gave him benefit of doubt thinking he was serving the other table. Even the young lady at the other was shocked he wasn't asknowledging us, making a comment like \" I know he saw them\" to her friend.   We are working professionals in the area, not a group of hobos sitting there. After close to 30 minutes the other lady got up to get the waiter after he ignored us waving him over. We were so beyond insulted we left and went next door to The Main Ingredient which was soooooo much better. OMG talk about fresh delicious food.   Sorry Humble Pie, your racist/sexist, rude, ignorant horrible whatever waiter killed it for us. We will be sure to let everyone know about this experience. We will be moving our group over to The Main Ingredient.",

To start for appetizers I have had the calamari with basil chili dipping sauce. Very good sauces calimari is like most other local restaurants. Surprisingly a very small portion for ten bucks. Caprese salad was great small portion easily feeds two.    I really couldnt put my finger on it but wasnt happy with antipasto board. Big pieces of bread cheese ehh lotsa of olives I think the meats just werent that tasty. wine bar in arcadia is what I compare it to and for about same price much better quality and larger selection.  But lets focus on what they are known form.   I have had margherita and SOP(sausage onions peppers mozarella and ricotta) and all have been great experiences. Most recently was the margheriata and added proscuito(italians forgive me for my horrible spelling) . Nice light crust good tomato sauce . generous serving of mozzarella tomatoes and proscuitoo covered the entire pie but not overdone.   Donuts for dessert are a must powdered sugar and some sugary goodness syrup",

I solely blame one rude employe named Hannah she's a short blonde with a horrible attitude, it's really disappointing we eat lunch at Humble Pie often, this was our first time at this location and never again. I see that they treat certain customers better than others. If you're a young person don't bother coming here you'll be disrespected and taken as a joke. I absolutely hated it here! Good luck if you try it, they're awful and honestly I was afraid to eat my food. They seem as the type to spit in it. Also, I am an open lesbian women and if looks could kill..

The vibe at Humble Pie on 7th is definitely good, perhaps due to its proximity to the alterna/artsy Coronado hood.  Relaxed, cool people, good atmosphere and tasty food.  We decided on drinks (a beer for the hubs and some tasty tempranillo for me) and ordered a large salad and a pizza to split.  Our server was great, always making sure our glasses were full and we were happy.  The salad was tasty and our arugula pizza was so good.  Who knew arugula on pizza would be so yummy?  While I was a tad disappointed when I didn't find something super chocolatey on the menu for dessert, the apple crisp topped with vanilla ice cream was delicious.     We've since been back for drinks and pizza at the bar.  The bar tender was very attentive and friendly and the brick oven pizza was delish.

James Brown was playing in the background, I thought that was awesome, we had the choice of sitting at the bar or at a table. So we chose the bar and the bar has a very old school feel to it.  With wine bottles lined up on top of each other and what seemed to be a full bar of different alcohols.  We got mimosas and they use a presecco champagne that we were fond of.  Once we ordered our pizza and soup combo, the soup came out surprisingly fast and was very tasty. The minestrone with sausage. I ordered the parmesean chicken pizza and my mom got the artichoke pizza both very delicious and served fast. Nothing was necessarily mind blowing, but it was a nice first experience and very chill place to have lunch.",

    "text": "I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.   At lunch.  No cover charge.  No two minimum drink.  FREE ENTERTAINMENT It wasn't just me either. Side splitting laughs from the service provided by our server, Rizzo were heard throughout the restaurant. I wish I had caught the other fellas names who were singing and putting on a show. (Listing to Bon Jovi, Bruce Springstein and whatnot takes on a whole new meaning when someone else is passionately belting it out.)  I said singing, but, no. That does not quite describe the action that was going. I really wish I had a photo. Think Elvis. Arms swinging, legs shaking, THAT.  I've photographed everything in the world, but not this. I've failed you.  FOOD I wasn't sure what my stomach was in the mood for, so I ordered the soup | 1/2 sandwich lunch special. Sweet deal for $8.95!   The Creamy Butternut Squash soup greeted my with the cutest sour cream detail. (see photo!) It was also incredibly rich. In private I'd probably lick the bowl. (Sorry Mom!)  The Grilled Caprese Sandwich surprised me a bit. (Mozzarella, pesto, roasted grape tomatoes.) Grilled cheese sandwiches are meant to be buttered. This one was definitely buttered!    SEATING The bar area provides a nice view of the pizza hearth. There is additional high top seating in the bar area. In the back of the restaurant there are low top, four top tables that can be pushed together to accommodate groups.  SIDE STORY We heard Rizzo taking photos of another group. \"Will you take our picture?\" \"Sure!\" [Takes pictures using everyone's camera] \"Can I take a picture with MY camera?\"  There is a cute outdoor patio area as well. I asked Tracy J. to take photos of this area and some others for us. (These walking sticks will be the death of me!)  GREAT SERVICE I joked about the show. But we were checked on constantly. Our drinks were never empty. Our plates were cleared as we nibbled away. I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch and appreciated the great customer service.  Love it!",

Much to our surprise they offered an express lunch option even on the weekend which we thought was great! So we both had the express lunch... I had the pizza/salad combo for 9.95 which was a lot of food. I chose the veggie salad, it was awesome. Lots included in the salad (white beans, cheese, avocado, jicama, green beans, lettuce). My pizza selection was the margherita which was simple and great. I love the crust! We also tried the soup/salad combo for 7.95. Soup was butternut squash which was very good and the strawberry Gorgonzola salad which was equally as delicious. Great prices and the food was wonderful.",

My usual go-to is their original Bruschetta, Margherita Pizza with cherry tomatoes baked in the pizza, and a glass of wine or Kilt Lifter. I recently tried their S.O.P. Pizza and it was delicious! Another favorite would be their Grilled Chicken Pesto pizza (I like it best with red sauce). Their fries and fried calamari are also pretty yummy!   Keep an eye out on Groupon- they're constantly offering good deals for certain locations!",

    "text": "So, I've lived downtown for over 20 years, and have had my share of good pizza! The food here was good, but service left a lot to be desired.   All three of my kids work in the service industry, so I try to be extra considerate and always offer them (servers) the benefit of the doubt. But this time, I just couldn't...  My daughter and I came in on a Sunday evening, around 6-ish. There were only a couple of other parties there when we walked in. A young man walked up to us and asked us if we'd like to sit outside or at a table inside, We chose inside. We picked a table near the back corner, and the server right away asked for our drink order. I think it was then that he realized the table he sat us at was a little dirty, so he offered to clean it. After wiping it down, we gave him our drink order. Our table was cleaned, but, he forgot to give us place settings. We waited a few minutes to see if he was going to come back with some, but after about 10 minutes, we just grabbed some from the table next to us.  He comes back with our drink order, and asks if we would like to order any appetizers. My daughter orders the  tempura fried green beans, and before I can order anything else, he leaves to put the order in. He comes back about 10 minutes later and asks if we've decided what to order. By then we had finished the green beans. I order the toasted ravioli, and then we both order our entrees. I order the meat lover's pizza and my daughter has the grilled caprese. The ravioli comes out fairly quickly, and a few minutes later, the rest of our order is out as well. Everything tasted great. No complaints there.  Between getting the last of our order two more families come in. A party of three and a party of six. There are two other servers that we can see come out to help with the other parties. Once the other parties arrived, we were just short of ignored the rest of the time we were there. Our drinks were never refilled, even as the other parties' drinks (wine mostly) were never left empty.   We had been done eating for about 10-15 minutes before our server came by to ask if we needed boxes for our leftovers. We say yes, and he promptly gives us a box and the check. I place my card in the bill, and we wait...................for almost another 20 minutes..............all the while, these other parties, I felt, were being given great service. It was very disappointing. I also hate to mention that the other parties were of a 'lighter' skin pigment than us......   I just hope that this was a fluke, and a bad night for \"________\", our server (because he never told us his name either!).  I won't be going back to find out.",

Every time I've been in, the staff are friendly and give great service! It can be a busy spot, and they do a great job multitasking with a smile!   The food is incredible! The pizzas are made in the wood oven, so have a great flavor (can sometimes come out with darker/ more cooked spots, but that is what happens in a wood oven and adds to the authenticity)! My favorite salad of all time is their chopped salad - the lemon vinegarette is fresh and the salad is hearty and delicious! Oh, and the tempura green beans are amazing!   All in all, this location is a Phoenix gem offering great food, great ambaiance, and great people! Enjoy!",

They have food deals from 3pm-6pm and drink deals from 11am-6pm. We have tried a lot of their food and have never been disappointed. The only reason that I am giving it four stars  instead of five is because of service. The service is really hit or miss. Sometimes is great and other times it is awful. Our visit in January was one of the awful ones and I think it was due to being a bit understaffed on their kids eat free day, but when it takes an hour to get your check and pay it, that is just too much. We also only saw our waiter a handful of times and often had empty drinks. Past visits we have had better service, but it is never a guarantee here.",

Service on the phone for the takeout order was solid. We arrived about 10 minutes late to pick up . It was to be ready in 15-20. We arrived in 30. Though the service was good and prompt, the order wasn't ready and the crew seemed to be hustling pies out of the oven. It was only another 5 minutes or so. No biggie.  The veggie salad was very good; however, when we opened the pie boxes, we thought the Margherita was pretty sad. Sure there are all kinds of variations on this fare that has evolved from peasant food, but we took a pic so you can judge for yourself. It tasted rather \"okay.\" The roasted mushroom pie tasted really salty to me, which might have been because it was a bit overloaded with pancetta... probably cheap pancetta. That might have been nice for many folks to get extra swine, but we wanted a mushroom-based pie, not a pancetta pizza.",

The pizza wasn't super good, and with a $75 bill for two pies, two salads, and two glasses of wine, I expect a lot more.  Its a nice sit down spot, and I love the location, but a few notes:  - Service isn't good. We ordered two salads, two pies. Pies came out before the salads did, so our pizzas sat there and got cold while we finished our salads. I am a big fan of things being timed and plated properly. Especially when I am paying what we did for dinner.  Also, hand your customers the proper pizza box for their left-overs, not a styrofoam container. Its a classy move to give the cardboard box, and since you're trying to be a classy place, go with the solid.  - Too much salt. They use A LOT of salt in the dough and in the toppings. So much so that my girlfriend was having a hard time later in the night with all the sodium intake. If your food is good, you don't need that much salt to make it great. Take it down 80%.  - Work on your wine list For what you have, its over priced. Get something different in there, stop with the stock bottles from everywhere else in Phoenix.  - Damn its loud. The acoustics in there are unrelenting. If you plan on having a conversation with your date or fellow diners, try somewhere else.  ----   Long story short, you're not Pizzeria Bianco. Stop trying to pretend to be. Go a different direction and get better at that.",

I wish I hadn't as not more than 50 feet from where I sat people where most likely enjoying some awesome appetizers and good food for way less.  I tried the wings which had an odd taste but were so so. The antipasto board was terrible and for 11$ should have had a little effort to it. The food came slow as well as the service was slow and inattentive. The lady we had seemed to not be thinking about the place since we had to request a pizza to go 3 times she came back out from the back. I must note that at the time there were 2 people at the bar and one other couple in the whole place. The steak and turkey chili was pretty bad also.    I am not a fan of pizza much besides maybe Red Devil or the now closed Western Pizza but I live with 3 females that are and not one of them cared for it. The bread was good but the sauce had the hint of toothpaste( probably from too much tomato paste) that peter piper seems to have in their equally terrible pizza.    I can't say I will be back, I think my girl liked the martini she had but she will have to go alone if she wants another.  I would mention that just like a terrible steak house or a Chili's you will pay more than you should for sub par dining. I don't mind paying well for good food but you can't help feeling like you have been ripped off when you have a larger than average bill for crappy food.",

I really don't want al dente fungus on a pizza. Second visit I had the Mac n Cheese. You have to step your game up for Mac n Cheese in this neighborhood. I guess if you like really salty Mac n Cheese, this is your place. Third visit, the egg pizza. Seriously, after being open for a couple months, have your oven dialed in so not to dislocate your jaw trying to eat the crust. Total disappointment for a needed neighborhood pizza joint. They do have good beer prices for happy hour. That's a positive.",

    "text": "So I had bought a groupon for this location right as it was changing from the Living Room to Humble Pie. Then, as the reviews came in, I started to dread going here... I was kind of scared that I made the wrong decision. Well, we went tonight and honestly, I'm glad we went. It's not because it was super awesome, but they do have some super awesome fantastic garlic fries! These things were good. They were garlicky, spicy, and lemon -y. Soooo good. I'd come back just for these. The rest of the food was pretty meh. We got the tomato bruschetta and it was ok, but the bread they use is too soft and got soggy and the balsamic was watery. We also got a margharita pizza (mostly to go, but we each had a slice there) and it kind of tasted like the frozen pizza you can get at trader joe's. So not awesome, and with so many excellent pizza places in the area, this would not be my first or even like tenth choice.... But they were nice to us, even though we came in at like 9 pm and the fries! yum. Maybe try happy hour?",

On my first trip I went with two girlfriends, one of which was about six months pregnant at the time.  We were forced to stand and wait for a table despite the fact the place was 80% empty.  We waited a good ten minutes, for no apparent reason, before being given the privilege of being seated.  The service was abrupt and rude.  At least the food was tasty, because I had something to stop my mouth from screaming at the obnoxious locals sitting at the bar.  I was sure I'd never go back there again, but about a year later another friend suggested we pop in for a glass of wine after yoga at Sutra, the studio next door.  Big mistake.  This time, the bartender barely paid us any attention in favor of entertaining another rowdy group of very intoxicated locals at the bar.  I guess Humble Pie is the place for people to get wasted and act ridiculous on a weekday night, no thanks.",

It's located in the same building as the unsuccessful \"Living Room\"  which has an awesome interior.   The joint was hoppin' but they managed to squeeze our family of three into a spot.  The service was great and we were in luck because the specials and happy hour prices were in place.    We decided to go for \"pie\" and each of us ordered a pizza all were quite good and our favorite was the Meatball Pie.  We would like to go back to try out something other than \"pie\" -- which I think I prefer Cibos instead.  This is definitely a family-friendly establishment that doesn't frown upon small well-behaved kids, but it still has the nice cool downtown vibe.",

    "text": "Humble pie has become a go restaurant for my family. When I became a parent I was worried we would be relegated to eating at places like Red Robin until my kids were in college. As a \"foodie\" this deeply concerned me. I made the decision that we would train our kids to be well behaved in a restaurant so we could continue to have fun dining experiences. Well, that didn't happen. My son is one of the pickiest eaters and as never ending ants in the pants which makes sitting for long periods of time a challenge. Thankfully for me there are places like Humble Pie. My husband and I really enjoy the pizza and my son seems to enjoy all the food on the children's menu. The location on 7th street has a trendy vibe and if you can get a seat on the patio, there's always great people watching. On top of good food in a cool atmosphere, they're fast and kids eat free on Sundays!! If you're not a parent, you will really enjoy Humble Pie for their food and drinks, but if you're a parent and want good food in a child friendly atmosphere, look no further than here! It's a win for everyone!",

We started off with some fabulous pink lemondrops and some hummus.  The drinks were very tasty and we polished them off in record time, then decided to order more drinks and food.   We ordered: olives, baked raviolis, a wedge salad for me, and bruschetta for my buddy.  The salad was yummy; I was craving something light after the holiday and it really hit the spot!  The olives were delicious as well.  I wasn't as thrilled with the ravioli....it was bl and needed more spice and texture, in my opinion.  There were tons of people taking pizzas to go so I plan on trying some next time.  Overall, my experience was positive,....the place is cute, the staff is attentive, and the natives are friendly.  I will most definitely be back :)",

    "text": "I have been to Humble Pie three times now. The first time was take out pizza, and I was helped promptly upon arriving at the restaurant. I was not very impressed with the pizza, although I came back to dine in to give it another chance. My boyfriend and I ate at the bar. I enjoyed the toasted ravioli appetizer, and the Schreiner's Italian Sausage was average. There are so many other pizza places in the area that make a better pizza with high quality ingredients. My third visit; however, was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.  I went in on a Friday after work for happy hour with 6 co-workers. All but one drink came out in a timely manner, although 3 waters took quite some time. Our food arrived and we were missing one appetizer and two pizzas. I spoke to our server to inform him we were missing some items, including the water and drink. He said we only ordered one of the two missing pizzas and I assured him we had ordered two. Everything except the second pizza arrived. When we asked for it, our server's comment hinted at disbelief as if we ate it and lied! At the end of dinner, we still had not received the pizza. We ordered 2 to go orders and one dessert. The to go orders came out in regular dishes, we asked for them to go and asked for the dessert and the elusive pizza. We received the to go dinners, but no pizza or dessert. When one person asked for the check, our server made a comment in a rude tone about how she probably wants to pay for her portion out of all 7 and asked if she knew what she ordered. At that point we asked a food runner for a manager and our server was brought over. We insisted to talk to a manager. The manager finally came to our table, apologized profusely, took off the pizza and dessert from our bill, and made sure we had all items requested. He also was kind enough to give us coupons for a free pizza when we spend a minimum of $20!",

I got the text saying that my food was ready, so I headed over to the restaurant to pick it up. I just moved here from Louisiana, and I can say that this place reminded me of New Orleans, but not in a good way. The restaurant smelled like Bourbon Street, in the fact that it smelled like stale beer and vomit. Not a great first impression. Then, the staff were very friendly, which was the only redeeming quality of this whole visit. It took about 10 minutes to figure out where my food was, and by the time I was handed my food, it was completely cold. I got home to pizza that had cheese so cold that it had congealed on the pizza. The crust is so thin that it doesn't hold anything on it, especially toppings like meatballs. The fried mozzarella tasted good, but it was too cold to really enjoy. This has definitely been one of the worst experiences I have ever had since I moved here. I will most certainly NOT be back.",

    "text": "On January 4, twenty of my friends and I had a dinner at Humble Pie on 7th Street.  Two days before the date, I spoke to someone who took my original reservation for 15 w/o any problems. I also informed her that we will want separate checksI'm sure, to which she said that it wouldn't be a problem. On 1/4 around 2 p.m.., I called again to confirm the reservation at 5 p.m. and also informed the guy on the other line that the reservation will now be for 20 not 15. He said it wouldn't be a problem, but noticed that the note on the reservation said \"separate checks.\" He then said that Humble Pie CANNOT do separate checks for groups of 8+ because that's their policy. I wish that I was given the correct information when I first called because that would've changed my decision to have the dinner there. Some of my guests were just going to stop by and not stay long for dinner. At that point, it was too late to find a place and inform all 20 guests of the change, so I stuck with it. But for the record, I was already annoyed that a staff member did not know an important restaurant policy that should've been ingrained from the firstday of training. The reasoning I was given for the \"one check policy\" was: \"You only have one server for the evening...\". That sounded like a recipe for poor customer service.  Well, that's pretty much what we got that evening.  1. As a guest was finishing up his Kiltlifter, he noticed that there was a piece of \"ice\" at the bottom of the glass, which he thought was odd for beer. As he got the piece of \"ice\" in his mouth, he realized it was a piece of broken glass. Luckily, my guest is so even-keeled that when he informed our waitress that evening of the broken glass, he didn't make a big fuss and just told the waitress to inform the bartender in case there are other shards lying around. She said that earlier in the day, a glass or two did break/shatter and the piece was probably one of the remnants. My other friend then got worried and checked her Kiltlifter from the bottom and noticed that the bottom of her pint glass was cracked.   The incident was clearly NOT the waitresses' fault and she quickly told us that both beers will not be charged. My guests were grateful and they each received another pint of Kiltlifter. Luckily, my guest didn't order a diet Coke first, which is his usual, because if he had, he wouldn't have even seen that piece of glass coming, and probably sucked on it like ice. But he didn't make a fuss because well, sh*t happens.  2. Then the SAME guest ordered his burger with no cheese because of dairy allergies. Everyone ordered pizza or wings. People got their food served, but an HOUR AND A HALF after he placed his order, he still hadn't gotten his burger. Again, the waitress was apologetic but at that point he didn't want the burger. You would think that they'd give him extra attention after the glass incident, but no. He didn't say anything because that isn't his personality and he knew that I would be upset. And since it was my birthday dinner he didn't make a fuss to ruin the evening. Some of my guests asked for water and that was a little difficult to get, too.   3. After all this inconvenience, we were hoping that they could honor our request for separate checks. But there were inconsistencies--some were granted that request and then some were not. Frustrating! To be honest, she was good for the most part doing her job solo. She probably would've gotten a 20+% gratuity anyway from each of the guest  Now imagine this concept, if there were maybe  2 servers or maybe 1 1/2 servers for our party, the poor service wouldn't have happened. One of them would've noticed that while everyone else was eating, one guest wasn't. Our waitress was not only waiting on our tables but other tables as well.  Humble Pie, look at it from our perspective: my guest, who sucked on a piece of broken glass and was not served his burger (but instead a consolation pepperoni pizza, which, according to the waitress, was ordered but she can't figure out who ordered it, but it didn't matter anyway because my guest is allergic to dairy) was forced to pay part of the gratuity that was included in the bill. For bad service.  And we're not faulting the waitress, who was working her a** off that evening, we fault poor management. I think you've done her a disservice because she seems awesome, but physically, you can only do so much.   I've supported this establishment when it was The Living Room and I wanted to support  Humble Pie because I support local. Sometimes good food is not enough.  Anyone can get \"good food\" anywhere and they are plentiful out there, but selling an experience is an art. I'm not complaining because I'm asking for compensation or a freebie. But I am asking you to consider how you manage the restaurant.",

In my classic move, I called in my order and then arrived early to have a drink at the bar (I always do this to A) get a beer and B) make sure I get my food right when it's ready, to ensure quality control haha. So I called in our order, and promptly drove over for an ice cold beer. The place was nice, i could see just having a beer and an app at the bar. It was very welcoming. I got this pizza with sausage, roasted peppers and ricotta that was pretty good. Wifey went with a cheese pizza to split with my daughgter. Both were pretty good, but missing the char I love from the usual brick oven restaurants. The service was great and the quality of the pizza was good, just a bit of for me. I'll go back again as I didn't have a bad experience. It beats the wait at Cibo, but I think Cibo's ;pizza is better. it's closer than LGO (to me) but LGO's pizza is better. it's not quite as good as Centurion, but a bit closer.

The woman stated that we could sit anywhere and our server would be with us soon. About ten minutes later, the same woman came back and stated that she would be taking our drink order but our real server would be with us soon. Ten minutes later, the same woman came back with our drinks and then took our food order. My friend ordered a white wine and she came back with a red. When it was time to go, we put our forks and napkins on our plates, indicating that we were done. It took another ten minutes to get our check.  We left a four dollar tip. Never, in my life, have I left a tip under five dollars. It was well deserved.   I will be eating the food from humble pie again, but I will be taking it home to REALLY enjoy it.",

I was with 5 other girls and it was our first visit to Arizona.  Our waiter was super nice and really helpful! We had a vegetarian in the group and they were telling us of their favorite vegetarian pizzas and being really accommodating to everything that we wanted.  We ended up getting 2 fried raviolis, french fries, and 2 pizzas, the margarita and the fig and prosciutto. It all tasted absolutely amazing!  We stayed until about 10:30 and not once did they try to rush us, they just cleaned up the restaurant and left us alone!",

Order the Garlic & Potato pizza and then ask them to include Pancetta as a topping. The combination of all of the flavors really works together: the bacon-y goodness of the pancetta, the herbal notes from the rosemary-seasoned potatoes, the rich roasted garlic and pungent Gorgonzola. A new favorite!",

Went on a Thursday to take advantage of the Date Night Special which is one app, 2 salads and a pizza to share. Really good deal for $20.  I got there about 8 minutes before HH was over and took advantage of that too.  We order the toasted ravilois (rocatta cheese is the best), 1 chobbed salad and 1 apple and a rugloa salad. He got the chobbed and it looked better than mine, but to each their own. Rizzo (hands the best waiter there) recced the Scheiners pizza and it was fantastic. 6 hearty slices was more than enough after the 2 small meals that came before it. Drinks are best on HH but moderately priced afterwards. THe atmosphere is fantastic. Outdoor seating are large park picnic tables. Not the most comfy things to sit on and they're a bit far between bench and table top but it was worth it. The canopy lights and great smells and sounds coming from the main dining had a great ambiance.   I'd totally go back here. Would like to try the fried green beans from the app menu and the grilled chicken pesto pizza. On online and check out their daily specials in addition to HH each day. Super place.",

The service was average or even less than. The staff didn't have very good personalities and on one occasion, a manager came over and had apologized for the wait time and the fact that the waitress had been short/rude. He tried to make a joke about how she was helping out from the Scottsdale location (which we have been to and enjoyed before) and how she wasn't exactly a 7th st location fit just yet.. It seemed out of place for him to comment, but he was light hearted and it didn't disturb us. We have always had great food from here.. and I would recommend their salad and the goat cheese pizza.

Updated December 21, 2017 I came tonight with my daughter Sara. She is gluten intolerant as well as unable to eat any type of dairy products. The wonderful staff here made sure that our meal was perfect. We were able to get a gluten-free pizza even though I had gotten a free pizza coupon. They made sure that they only put the cheese on my side of the pizza. Plus we ordered the veggie salad, which was excellent. They also separated that into two portions and put the cheese only on mine. Hannah and the staff here are so wonderful. Come and try it out",

However it has the most tasty pizza of the three. They have a bar with mediocre beers on tap. It is a nice spot with great food to take a date. They have both patio and indoor seating. It is moderately priced and conveniently located to many Downtown Phoenix places of interest, but probably not within comfortable walking distance. However, it is an inexpensive Uber or Lyft ride to many nearby destinations. The food is great, the staff is friendly, and I have never had a bad experience.",

Seating is stylish and comfortable, and service is good.  The bad: The fries looked good on paper, looked good in person, but were way too salty. The equally salty aioli didn't help. The pizza was alright...I'm a huge fan of the sauce they use, and the cheese was totally legit. The crust left much to be desired...it was a bit too thick and crunchy toward the edges...not the texture you want from a wood-fired pie.   The ugly: During normal hours, they charge as much for their specialty pizzas ($15) as some of the valley's most coveted pizza parlors, but are clearly not in the same league. This is a strip mall chain that wants to compete your favorite gourmet/Neapolitan locale, but at least needs better dough to come close.   It's great for a quick lunch, or some day drinking with your pals, but if you want a sit down pizza place for dinner, you can do better. Much better.",

    "text": "3/13/2018 Yelp Review  6149 N Scottsdale Rd  Scottsdale AZ 85250 - 2.2 miles  (480) 556-9900  I have been coming to this Humble Pie for years and it does not disappoint. While this is not a five star, fancy restaurant, it is delicious food at a good price. My boyfriend and I like to come here for the express lunch menu, which is offered everyday from 11-3 where we order a 10 inch margherita pizza and small chop salad for just $9.95. It is the perfect amount of food at the perfect price. We also try to make it to \"Date Night Thursdays\" every Thursday after 6:00 where you get an appetizer to share, two small salads and a pizza to share for $24.95. The food is delicious and consistent. I am a die hard margherita pizza lover and theirs is my favorite in the valley. It is light, fresh, not too cheesy and has the perfect tomato and basil taste. All of their pizzas are wood-fired. I recommend asking for your pizza to be a little bit more charred than usual to make sure the crust is not too floppy. The chop salad, which has salami, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and romaine is also to die for and compliments the pizza perfectly. As far as appetizers go, the tempura fried green beans or toasted ravioli are my favorite. Aside from the margherita pizza, the organic local vegetable is also a must try!   The ambience of Humble Pie is family-friendly with a comfortable, neighborhood feel. Kids eat free every Sunday and everyone is very friendly. The restaurant is very quaint; a small dining room, patio and bar that wraps around both the inside and outside. I've eaten here by myself, with my boyfriend and in a group of people and they're always very accommodating.   While sometimes it can get busy, the service is overall pretty fast and accommodating. I think the key word here is fast. Lunch time is pretty busy because when they say \"Express Lunch\" they mean it. I have noticed that sometimes the restaurant can be a little understaffed, where at times this can cause a little bit longer of a wait for a table or to be greeted by a waiter or waitress but overall, I have never had a bad experience nor waited a ridiculous amount of time for a table or for any of my food. My family and I also enjoy ordering take-out. It is done in about 20 minutes and is just as good.  Overall, Humble Pie is a great place to eat for lunch or dinner, on a date, with family, or by yourself to grab a quick bite for lunch or happy hour. Therefore I give Humble Pie 4/5 stars for it's comfortable ambience, fast service and consistently delicious pizza and salad. The food is great but the service could be a tad bit better. For what you pay, you get good food, good service and it's nice having a place you can rely on.",

My daughter and I each had the Express lunch, 10\" pizza with half salad. I had the strawberry and goat cheese salad and she had the Caesar. Both were so delicious!  For pizza I had the prosciutto and fig pizza which was a lot of fun. I didn't think I would eat the whole thing In one sitting but I did! My daughter had the pepperoni and her only complaint was she thought there were too many pepperonis on her pie. I don't see how that could be a bad thing but some kids are funny that way! They had some other interesting combinations and I'll surely be back to try them all!!!",

    "text": "Mr. B and I decided for pie this evening. We arrived at a good time (Happy Hour; best time of the day). We immediately sat down at the bar and began to peruse the menu. There were 10 patrons throughout the entire establishment (including the tables outside). That in mind, I'm curious why the service was so mediocre (3 stars).  We started out with an order of french fries (parsley, garlic, lemon zest, pecorino cheese, chili flakes with garlic aioli). There was another couple at the bar having the same and they LOOKED delicious. For an entree we decided to share a Humble Pie Signature Sausage Pizza (roasted fennel, house-made mozzarella, tomato sauce). Mr. B has a thing for everything sausage. All of that was washed down with a few glasses of Pinot Noir.  Though the fries were visually tasty looking in front of others, I have to say I was rather disappointed when I received our order. Its apparent that they're frozen pre-cut fries however, they shouldn't taste as such. The wet ingredients overpowered the fries making them horribly soggy and extremely cold. If I were to rate the fries on their own merit, they'd be worthy of a whooping 3 stars.  The Signature Sausage gets a good 5 stars (we've been back several times and Mr. B gets the SAME thing every time). The combo of the ingredients is perfect! Something about that fennel. If you are really hungry, grab a pie for self. Should you adore your company (as much as I do mine), I'd suggest sharing a pie and perhaps a salad to bring your meal full circle (you won't be overstuffed). Definitely a pie you should consider.  I am quite disappointed with the level of service that we received, or lack thereof. For there to only be a few people in the restaurant, I found it unacceptable that servers were not attending their respective areas as they should. Our bartender spent more time away from his area than he did behind the bar (there were only 4 of us at the bar). The disappointment that night has not stopped me from returning (I LOVE A GOOD PIE) however, I am cautious as to whether we dine in or take-out.",

This place was over priced, had fairly poor service, and the pizza just wasn't that good.  I ordered the sausage pizza.  The sausage was pretty bland.  They also screwed up my order by adding onions when I didn't ask for them.  I've had my order messed up on pizzas before by having toppings left off, but never added on that I simply didn't order.  Found that strange.  I would have sent it back, but the waiter didn't check to see how everything was until about fifteen minutes after the food was brought to the table.  I'd give Humbe Pie 1.5 stars if I could, but rounded up since it is better than Dominos and Pizza Hut.  I went after buying the GroupOn coupon, but won't be returning.",

Those who enjoy brick oven pizza this is a must.  And those who just eat delivery pizza must come to grips that Pizza Hut's HQ is not in Italy.    Food: The heart of the house is right in the dinning area, a wood fire brick oven. And ladies, were talking real wood here.   They make the pizzas right in front of you, how fun see. Quick note, they do a great job with non pizza items, and a fun kids menu.   Service: this is a pizza joint right,  rule number one for amateurs, don't get antsy pansy because things take time on the weekends, this place gets crowded. Why well probably because Humble Pie has created a popular brand.     I like personal service, most the time your server takes care of you from start to finish and i like that.    I think restaurants like Humble Pie have given new life to the 7th St. Phoenix restaurant district.  Im glad to see the 85006 zip code continuously attracting more restaurant owners.  The Phoenix area is building up and keeping growing businesses a shot at success.    Happy Pizza, Kevin U.",

The menu clearly states that they don't want you to substitute any ingredients...which is a little annoying for a vegetarian.  The cream of the crop at this place is their french fries - they come piled high and are flavored with garlic, lemon, cheese and red pepper flakes...oh man.  I can't believe I ate the whole thing.  We had great service here, and my water-loving boyfriend never had an empty glass - seriously, he drinks so much water. So, I just wanted to give the server and bus boy props for that!    For the people who were fans of The Living Room (who was the previous occupant in this building), there is a little menu of \"Living Room Favorites\" that they will still serve you.  I didn't order anything from it, but I thought that was a nice added extra.",

Was there at happy hour and drinks were 4$ for specialty drinks and appetizers were half off.   Ordered a lemoncello margarita which was awful, it tasted like sweet and sour mix that was filled 70% with sour mix and then had 30% more sour mix poured on top. BLEH. After my drink arrived the server comes up and lets me know that the appetizer and my drink are not happy hour price because im using a groupon. I tell him to hold the appetizer as its 8$ instead of 4$, but since i've drank some of my drink feel bad about sending it back....turned around the sour mix drink was 8$ instead of 4$...DOH!.   Ok enough with the sucky nickle and dime stuff...on to the food and taste.   I had the Prosciutto and pear pizza and my roomate had pepperoni, both were good but not amazing. Not what I expect from a $14 personal pizza. If I had a choice between this place or a place like Pizzaria Bianco or The Parlor I would never go here again.

The pizzas are average (do not order the chicken pesto pizza - wth is up w \"fried onions\" on top they were completely dry, hay like n inedible), the salads aren't too bad (the wedge was good) but they do have a heavy hand w dressing which can ruin a salad very fast.  Unfortunately the mozz app was the best thg so far n idk if that's a good thg .. Plus idk how many folks wld be here if it wasn't for Groupon.",

    "text": "Maybe it was our fault that we didn't go for Happy Hour pricing like many other reviewers mentioned, but when we received our tiny little Meat Lovers pizza at the full price of $17, we were extremely disappointed. The size could be ignored if the pizza itself was mind-blowing, but it was not. I wouldn't put it on the same level as fast food pizza chains, but it is not even close to any of the other specialty gourmet pizza places in the area which use fresh ingredients and have signature sauces. We also ordered the fried ravioli, which was good enough, but all in all, just as the pizza, it was sickeningly average.  Do they only price their food so high just so they can slash it down for happy hour? I think that's good business sense for them given the quality of their products but I won't be giving this place another chance when I'm actually craving pizza for taste and flavor.",

The servers we spoke with were very nice, though service itself was surprisingly slow considering how few folks were dining. We never did get water refills and had a 15 minute wait to get our check, and had to flag someone down.  I ordered the lunch express with a veggie salad, and fig and prosciutto pizza. The salad was okay; it was a bit heavy on beans, so that flavor dominated. I liked the crust of the pizza. The toppings were tasty though the fig jam was in very heavy dollops. I really liked how the fig flavor worked with the prosciutto and goat cheese.  My husband had the lunch express with the Caesar salad and meat lovers pizza. He found both to be okay, but they didn't strike him as standing out in a \"wow\" kind of way.  Really, the lunch express is a very good buy. The pizzas were okay but we wouldn't go out of our way to come here again. There are a few other pizza places around with a lot more oomph and more attentive service as well.",

We sat at a pub table near the wall- small so not a lot of good seating, the bar was full of a group who knew each other. We ordered drinks and happy hour mozzarella- the mozzarella was very good, the tea- average. We ordered minestrone soup- it came out when we had our first bite of our appetizer so I asked them to hold on the pizza so we could catch up, but no... it came out after a couple more bites, so we had all 3 courses on the table, getting cold and feeling rushed. The soup had large noodles, a mishmash of veggies- never seen peas in it and thin slices of sausage. It was not very flavorful and I was not impressed. The pizza was ok-not thrilling, very small for $16.00!!  A solo musician was coming in to start playing as we were finishing- of course! I will not be back!",

It was not nearly as good as before and we added chicken which came out as a dry sliced chicken breast on top.  Also ordered the meatballs app which came out just warm with a sprinkle of  parmesan that looked like it was out of a can. The cheesy bread appetizer was the best thing. We also had a kiddo with us but didn't notice until we were leaving the sign that said kids eat free on Sunday.  Since she's only 2 we don't usually get her a meal but it would have been nice if they had told us.  For $50+ I'll go someplace else next time.",

The pizza was unimpressive, it was actually burnt and bland. I was excited about the fact that we got there in time for the \"Happy Hour\" which is 3-6p. We tried the chicken drumettes which were just okay. We also ordered the fries that we were told 'were amazing' and sadly...they were not. We did rather enjoy the calamari. So if you do choose to go there: I guess get the calamari.  (p.s the server was this amazing college kid. I forget his name, but it was something biblical. GIVE HIM A RAISE).",

Went with three friends and we started with a bruchetta appetizer that was delicious and then we each ordered a different pizza.  These pies are 12\" around and they only make the one size...easily enough to share if you want.  One friend got the gluten free crust (an additional $3) and he really liked it.  I ordered the BLT pizza which is exactly like it sounds....a BLT sandwich on pizza crust and it was very good...topped full of lettuce, cherry tomatoes, bacon and mayonnaise (yum!)    Our waiter was adorable and very attentive.  I was the only one hungry enough to finish my pizza and the others took about half of theirs home.  The vibe is comfortable as a place on lower 7th St. should be.  Its more like being down on Mill Avenue than being in Scottsdale or uptown Phx (not that there is anything wrong with either of those places).  We were all too full to order dessert but next time I want that pizza cookie!",

We opted to order the wings, pretzel with cheese dip, cheesy bread, and fries. To our surprise the portions were huge! The cheesy bread alone was the size of a flatbread pizza! Overall, good experience and would definitely be back for happy hour :)",

I ordered the S.O.P. pizza (Sausage, carmelized onion, roasted pepper and ricotta) which was very tasty although the middle pizza was a little soggy.  I didn't pull out my measuring tape but I'm sure the pizza was closer to 12\".  The 12\" version cost $14.50. You get to choose between the four salads they carry on the menu (all sounded great).  The chop salad had roasted turkey, salami, grape tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and a divine herb vinaigrette.  The small salad on the menu costs $7 so the $9.95 price tag on the pizza/salad combo was a great value.  Will definitely stop here again.  P.S.  Kids eat free on Sundays!",

    "text": "Ironically we decided to try this place not for the pizza, but specifically to try the pasta dishes, as I am always looking for a nice place (live in south phx, options for Italian slim). Sat outside, which is another fav of mine. Yes parking was a bit full...there are 4-5 eateries in immediate area so they all compete for spaces....but found a spot easy enough a couple buildings down. Wait staff were absolutely delightful, friendly and helpful in selecting wine choice and meal. Our pasta dishes were great, not huge selection, but what they had was fresh and very tasty. We are a fan and will go back. Anxious to try the mac and cheese. We also tried the olives....yum a nice start with a good bottle of wine (which was 1\\2 price!). We were seated immediately with no wait...roughly around 6:30.",

    "text": "Sad to say but I've been coming to humble pie off 7th street for a long time and have gotten to the point where I'm going out of my way to write this review. I'm never one to openly downgrade or talk bad about any business but after tonight I have decided to no longer eat here. I walked in to place an order for take out and was not greeted. Once I flagged a worker down to place a worker, he responded by looking at his phone clock as to possibly say it might be too late. It was not, lol I was \"just in time.\" So, after I ordered a buffalo chicken pizza, I had to find myself a seat to wait for the order to be made. Never offered water or beverage while waiting, (which I guess is fine but this is my review) once the pizza was done I opened to find one of the worst looking pizzas I have ever seen. Not to mention one of the items that is always on the pizza (celery) was missing. I awkwardly asked about the celery and got \"oh do you still want the celery?\" Im response. At that point I felt it appropriate to point out how poorly made, the pizza looked. Cheese poorly spread around crust, and chicken sparsely placed on about a fourth of the pizza. I love this place and the food tastes pretty good but after reoccurring incidents like this, again, I will not be eating here again. The one star is for when the food ordered is made correctly, or in correlation to how it is presented on the menu. The staff didn't seem to care or find anything wrong with the pizza. Again I am not picky and have never ever even posted about any other restaurants on yelp.",

Shortly after Humble Pie opened in its place, a Groupon came out, so it was perfect timing to try it.  We bought two Groupons, and I'm so glad we did.  The first time we went, we ordered the shrimp pizza and the mac and cheese, and split both. The food came SO fast after we ordered it, and the pizza was fresh out of the brick oven. The shrimp pizza was so tasty, and the mac and cheese was sinfully rich and good.   The second time, we went a bit lighter. The fiance ordered the chili (which is a holdover item from The Living Room menu - we had intended to try it before the Living Room closed) and a sandwich. I ordered a caprese appetizer. The chili was really good - I ended up eating half of it even though I thought I didn't want any. The caprese was soooo delicious. The mozzarella was super creamy and high quality, and the pesto was incredible. I would go back just for the caprese alone, but will certainly go back for the pizza, too.   The prices are good - not the cheapest around, but definitely high quality ingredients and preparation for the money.",

And I highly suggest that to anyone else wanting to avoid the very big lunch crowd. We all went with the lunch combo of pizza and salad- what a great deal and even better portions! I had the veggie salad which was so good and the perfect amount of everything. Every bite was delish. Then I had the BLT pizza, also very good. When you first see that mayo is on a pizza you might think twice, however it went perfectly with the rest of the toppings.  Due to the fact that we were on work hours, no adult beverages were purchased, however their happy hour drink menu starts at 11! That is great and it seemed like they had some good selections at good prices. The service was normal, nothing extraordinary or bad about it. The waitress did not huff and puff over the fact that we all needed separate checks. Waters were filled appropriately.  Will definitely return here.",

This place gets really high marks for both, in fact the crust is just darn good and chewy.   Tempura green beans were a really nice surprise as well. Probably my second favorite place for appetizer/side dish veggies after The Grind.   Service was spot on, atmosphere is way more fun than the previous Treinte Cinque(granted I never got to this location when it was The Living Room).    Now you may think we're getting a tad saturated with pizza places (cibo, Bianco, brick, oreganos, Zpizza, mama Mia, aiellos's, parlor, et al.), As do I, but this place is top tier and stays in the rotation.",

The food is terrific; I'm addicted to the tuna sandwich, and the lunch half-sandwich special is a great deal. You basically get a whole sandwich with a corner cut off plus a salad. And of course the pizza is cravable too. But what inspired me to write this review is the staff, who has been consistently friendly and accommodating. We had a birthday party there, and Aimee took amazing, patient care of everyone there. Rebecca and the other bartenders and waitstaff are also committed to making the guest have a great experience.

I've seen this place numerous times and one day we saw a Groupon for them, so decided to purchase it and give it a try.  The place was fairly dead for a Saturday night. I had always seen this place packed when passing by. Maybe we missed the rush?  The service was nothing special. Our server had no personality and seemed bored. I ordered a pizza with pistachios, parmesan and red onions and my boyfriend ordered some kind of BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza was dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. It wasn't AWFUL, but it wasn't REMARKABLE either. We left unimpressed and don't really have any craving to go back there again. Wish we understood what all the hype is about. Maybe we just ordered the wrong pizzas?",

We stepped in the back door and of course looked a little lost because we didn't know where or how to find a seat, as we passed a waiter, he told us to just take the table we were next to. He was back in a flash to bring us some water and see if there was anything we wanted to start with. I had a White Grape Martini, very good, very crisp: I would recommend if you like martinis.  For an appetizer we had the Tempura Fried Green Beans... pretty sure those are little pods of heaven in your mouth, just sayin. Then... the main course. Humble pie offers burgers and stuff, but of course we went for the pizza. We had the potato garlic pizza and took off the leeks and added sausage. It was wonderful. I love their crust to no end. The pizza, despite being cheesy, was not greasy, which so commonly happens. The only thing I would have changed about it would be to not have the potatoes slices, but cubed instead, but it still tasted magnificent.   Our server deserves his own section: Pretty sure his name was Rizzo, and he was HILARIOUS. He made my whole night just that much better. He was very funny and very engaged in making suggestions if we asked and complementing the selections we did make. He was just fun!   I will be going back!",

Intentionally or not, the place still has the same vibe as The Living Room which occupied the space until earlier this year. It's a very welcoming place and the staff has always been very friendly.  The variety here is what makes the cut. If you're making pizza like this, add something other than the same three or four pizzas I can get at any restaraunt. The Pear Pizza and the Egg Pizza here (among others) provide enough variety to keep me curiously coming back.  Their non-pizza items are also quite decent, but nothing notable.  On my most recent visit, I tried the egg pizza with Italian bacon. The crust was perhaps just a bit overdone, but still had a nice crisp consistency on the bottom with a slight buttery fluff on the outside. The toppings blended well and made for a very rich pizza. so much so that I had to ask for some to go home.  The prices are maybe just a hair high, but not unacceptably so. This place won't spring to mind first when I recommend pizza in Phoenix, but the good service and decent variety will assure that I probably come back again.",

I should have had the burger though because it came with a mountain of fries. When I was done with the modest serving of mac and cheese I was still hungry.

But that was okay, we got two delicious pizzas out of it, and the accommodated to us with the bill, too. I fell in love with their balsamic vinaigrette on the strawberry and gorgonzola salad. Only complaint is that if you choose to get chicken on your half salad, they give you a whole breast - it feels off balance!  The mixed drinks were delicious, and flavorful instead of cloyingly sweet like many places make them. The pomegranate martini was incredible, and the limoncello margarita will continue to give me wet dreams. Swearz.  The fact that I can get egg on pizza, and that they locally source ingredients creates many points in my book! I loved the place! The environment was perfect to facilitate conversation as well!  OH!

Food, 2 pizzas, arrived promptly, one good, the goat cheese pizza, though have had better for less elsewhere, the other with prosciutto, \"extra crispy\".  Blackened burnt crust utterly devoid of any trace of moisture - dry dry dry.  Hard & brittle.   Liked the general ambiance though rather dark to read the menus and the noise level was rather high.  Service was decent and fast.  After having just recently made first visit to the Parlor however, it was a poor showing by comparison as far as taste & price.  \"Gourmet\" indeed.     Based on this one single visit, to paraphrase a quote mis-attributed to Winston Churchill, Humble Pie has much to be humble about.

    "text": "So excited to try Humble Pie, but ultimately underwhelmed by the entire experience. The pizza was just average, which does not cut it with so many other fantastic pizza options in the area.  My husband and I started with the bruschetta. The serving size was pathetic-- two small slices, each cut in half. We then ordered the Chicken Pesto pizza. We had originally wanted to do half Pear Gorgonzola and half Chicken Pesto, but we were told they don't do split pizzas. We were a little thrown off by this, as splitting pizzas is a common practice at most places. The Chicken Pesto itself was unimpressive.  After the pizza, we were still not satisfied, so we ordered a side of garlic fries. The garlic fries were delicious... probably the best thing we had there, which is pretty sad for a pizza place.  But, what really turned the whole experience sour was our server's refusal to honor a coupon we had. We had received a coupon for a free pizza with the purchase of $20 worth of food and drink. We spent well  over this! However, since we were dining with our friends who also had this coupon, they refused to take it. We each met the minimum separately and had separate bills. It made no sense that by the mere pushing together of two tables, the coupon was None.   This was very upsetting as the server knew all along that we had the coupons and never mentioned this catch. It said nothing of it on the coupon itself either. We would have been more than happy to make up for the discount with a generous tip and perhaps a return visit. But the service was the nail in the coffin for us at Humble Pie.",

It has really good company on that stretch of 7th Street between Virginia and McDowell (The Main Ingredient is next door; America's Taco Shop is close by and I've heard great things about the Coronado Cafe), but Humble Pie just... falls short.  4 stars for location; 4 stars for ambiance (very chic); 5 stars for service (so friendly!), but - maybe - 2 stars for the actual pizza?  The crust had a great texture (lightly crispy exterior, but nicely chewy), but no flavor.  The pizza was over sauced and the sauce tasted like it came from a can.  The cheese was good and the basil was actually exceptional (which threw me off because they present it shredded, and I am used to nice, whole leaves on Margherita pizzas).  The cumulative effect?  OKAY pizza.  If it was a Sunday and I HAD to have pizza, might I go to this place again?  Maybe.  But I'd probably just wait 'til the next day and get one of those proven pizza pies from places close by - Cibo or Pizzeria Bianco.",

    "text": "I'm so disappointed!!! The food was great and I would love to come back, but unfortunately now I won't. My boyfriend and I stopped in last night and were greeted promptly. To her credit, our server was very nice (despite not smiling at us once). My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and I ordered the meatball pizza. My bf's order came out solo. The server's explanation (gesturing at the pizza maker) was, \"He kinda destroyed your meatball pizza. He's going to make you another one.\"   Ok, I totally understand that these things happen. But it would have been nice to get an apology. My bf and I shared his spaghetti and meatballs, but had I known we'd be sharing, maybe I wouldn't have ordered a MEATBALL pizza. OR maybe offer us another drink and to keep his plate warm until my entree was ready (so we can eat at the same time? Crazy idea.)  When my pizza finally arrived (after my bf's plate was finished), I still received no apology or hint of any possible inconvenience. I know this is awful, but I was shocked when the bill came and was charged the full $12.50 for my tardy pizza pie. (I'd like to add that I totally don't expect anything for free! Simply an acknowledgment of the problem.)  Too bad because it was delicious. But with gourmet pizza a-plenty downtown, service is key. To Humble Pie: a simple and friendly, \"sorry about that!\" goes a long way.",

I brought an appetite, and I was able to eat an entire pie... my wife, on the other hand, ate most of her pizza but brought one or two slices home.  The service was great.  When I ordered, I wasn't certain what to get, so I asked our waitress for help.  She recommended the pepperoni pizza but that I add olives on top.  I was immediately convinced, and I'm glad I was, as it was delicious!  The pepperonis were large, and the olives were a mixture of multiple olive types (as opposed to just cut-up black olives).  In addition to a tremendous pizza recommendation, our waitress was constantly refilling our drinks and checked in multiple times.    One thing we noticed was a Thursday Night \"Date Night\" special.  For $20, Humble Pie is offering 2 pizzas and a salad.  We will definitely be back to try this Thursday special out soon!",

    "text": "Unfortunately, after years of going to humble pie, I have seen their quality steadily decline.  I usually go in a few times a year for the the past 6 years or so now and I order the same thing every time, a simple pepperoni pizza.  Today, was the last straw.  I waited over 45 mins as one of the only 2 parties in the restaurant for my pizza.  All we ordered was a pizza, a Mac and cheese an appetizer and a dessert.  The other person in the restaurant ordered a salad and a pizza.  Her pizza came out before ours and she ordered a few minutes after us, that's when I realized something was wrong.  Our waitress brought the appetizer and the Mac and cheese just fine and then we sat there waiting for my pizza as our waitress lied blatantly to my face over and over about how it would be out shortly and that the pizza tore in the oven.  I could literally see them in the mirror and hear them talking behind me about how the dough was bad.  He shuffled around boxes and boxes of dough and I guess finally found something to make for us.  Meanwhile, our waitress came back and tossed a few coupons on the table and told us our pizza would be out in 5 mins.  I explained we were in a rush and were already gonna be late.  About 15 minutes later, the pizza comes out.  This pizza was nothing like what I know humble pie can do.  The dough tasted like a different kind of dough other than for pizza that they used as a backup in a pinch.  It was also clear that the pizza had been reheated.  The cheese was piled on top of the pepperoni to hide that fact.  Mind you, I've been going for years and order the same thing every time so I know what a humble pie pepperoni is like.  At the end of the meal I said something about it and the waitress tried to make me feel bad because it was the cook's 2nd shift?  As if it's my fault the restaurant is understaffed.  All she did was admit to me that the restaurant employs inexperienced staff and is okay with serving low quality food.  Not a good look.  I may or may not be back but I think after seeing them slowly use less quality ingredients over the years on top of my recent experience I think that the public deserves to know what direction the management is taking this restaurant in.  The bottom line is, our food took way too long, they served us some weird substitute dough, our server was flat out rude, and it wasn't even a busy time of day!",

    "text": "We came to Humble Pie after seeing it featured in Phoenix magazine (so sad that I can never find a place on my own...) and we were blown away.  It was a weeknight and all I wanted was some pizza to go and veg out on a couch watching a movie.  Well, after waiting on our to-go order we both wished we just stayed there! The restaurant is so incredibly inviting with its modern yet warm decor and a brick oven smack in the middle of the restaurant.  It was warm and smelled nice which was a bonus after walking from a car in 30 degree weather (crazy winter this year, isn't it?).  The staff were incredibly nice and we snacked on the \"butter\" mints that were placed by the exit while waiting.  I know they are for after the meal, but we were hungry!  Anyways, the pizza was fantastic.  One word: \"sourdough\"!  Well, it's either sourdough dough or something that tastes like it, but I thought that the pizza was fantastic!  It is not too thin and definitely not thick. Just perfect, on my taste buds.  We had parmesan chicken pizza (I think) and a margherita pizza.  Both were phenomenal.  We also ordered some french fries that were likewise super yummy.  As an aside, I was raised in NYC, which is famous for its pizza.  I have to say that Humble Pie's pizza is at least as good as New York pizza.    I will definitely come back, and I cannot wait to try a date night (Thursday after 6 pm: an appetizer, pizza, and two salads for $20).  Also, apparently there are like 10 different food places in that general area on 7th Street -- time to check them out!",

Positives: staff, Mac-and-cheese. Negatives: pizza taste, value for money spent. Overall, not a good value for what was received.",

    "text": "We tried this out last night. We won't be back.   There is no indication when you walk in that it's a seat-yourself restaurant. We stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something.   We sat ourselves, and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us. Perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons, so a server knows they've arrived?  Finally, the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us, and she was very polite and took our order.   Our drinks came out fairly quickly, but then we waited and waited for our food. This would have been understandable if the placed had been packed, but it wasn't. It was maybe 75% full (7:30 on Saturday) and there seemed to be plenty of servers. There was one large party on the patio.  I ordered the vegetarian salad (can't remember what it was called) that advertised avocado, jicama, beans, and other yummy things. When it arrived, there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top, and no more to be found. It was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad. It would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether. Also, the white beans were undercooked.   The pizzas were good. I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese, and it came loaded with summer squash, roasted carrots, olives (local? Hmm...), leeks, roasted onions, and the crust was thin and crispy. My husband also enjoyed his pizza.   I should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress, who comped my salad when I complained about it. I was willing to pay for it, but she offered to take it off the bill.   The final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant, but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners' experiences, then I'm afraid it's left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in. No such luck.   Anyway, this place has some things to work on. Fortunately for us, there are too many other great businesses nearby for us to give it a second chance.",

Then my \"white\" veggie pizza came out...it smelled terrible it was sopping in olive oil and I couldn't bare to eat more than one piece. The buffalo pizza my partner got was to heavy on the sauce and almost no chicken. The wait staff took their sweet time to get us the check and didn't even ask how the meal was. I can think of a thousand places with better pizza and service.",

    "text": "I probably would have given this place another star but..  well...  So at first the service seemed great, the staff seemed friendly, and we were having a great time.  We ordered one express lunch which is a great deal - half salad/soup with 1 pizza that's approx. 3 in smaller than the normal size for $10 and 1 of the roasted mushroom pizza.    The turkey chili was great - not too many beans, not too few, not too brothy, not too dry, nice chunks of turkey, etc - it was pretty perfect.  We got our pizzas very shortly after - another great thing since our appetites were appropriately whet.    The pizzas were pretty good.  The sauce was a bit plain, pretty good quality ingredients, and good amount of topping.  However, at least half of the outer rim of both our crusts were burned.  The mushroom pizza was even worse - the bottom of the crust of 2 slices were completely charred.    I usually comment more on the food than the service, but seems like ours took a severe nose dive after we got our pizzas.  My coke was empty for 20 min before a refill was even offered - at that point I asked for a box and the check since we'd been waiting for some attention for over half an hour.  Very disappointing after such an impressive start.  The waiter was actually helping the table right next to us and came and left without asking us if we needed anything about 5 times.    I rate harshly on steak restaurants that overcook steaks and in this case pizza restaurants that burn crusts to an inedible state.  The standard is higher when they base their whole business on a singular food.  I can't give this place more than 3.  I will go back though because the chili was so good, I would like to give this place another shot.  Maybe I just won't get the pizza.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place on our side of town as we've had takeout from another location and loved it.   We came in and there was a wait for a two top. No biggie, we both got a glass of wine and waited just a short while before our table opened up. We sat down having had maybe 4 sips of our wine.   We waited.   And waited.   We had our wine....  But no menus.   I joked that it was like Costa Rica and the slow service there. I was in a good mood and happy to sit down after a long day on my feet.   Still with the waiting.  No... STILL MORE with the waiting!  Now it was not funny anymore and we were being completely ignored. I checked my clock and it was 7:57pm. Clearly not a closing time issue. I tried to assuage my companion by telling him how tired I used to get after a big rush and they were probably trying to catch their breath.   Yeah... that argument only holds weight for so long before you realize you've still been sitting there with a glass of wine from the bar and NO MENUS OR ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM ANYONE. Seriously the guy who seated us was really nice. Where was he?  A girl came around and put place settings out at 4 tables. ALL AROUND US.   Still. No service.   Fuck. Are you kidding me? I was seriously patient. I know what working in the service industry is like. This is ridiculous.   \"If we finish our glasses of wine and no one has said a single word to us... we are leaving\".   \"But you are not allowed to chug your wine\".   \"Deal\".  {{{insert witty conversation for 5 minutes}}}  Alright. All done. We have not sped up our drinking. We were very fair and patient... up we go.   And we left.   Would you have done anything different?",

I tried to grab someone's attention but every time they just dodged me. We walked out and headed next door. If your busy it's understandable but at least bring by a water and greet the table. It's very rude and unprofessional to let a table sit for 15 min without acknowledging them. The Main Ingredient next door has been a much better experience.",

    "text": "We've been meaning to try this place for quite a while and the opportunity finally afforded itself. The parking lot was full, which we took as a good sign and lots of happy people enjoying their food inside & outside. Lively atmosphere, well appointed interior. The staffer who greeted us said she had 3 available seats at the bar or a high-top (if we didn't want outside). We told her there were 4 of us, so we'd take the high-top. She then brought us 3 menus and proceeded to take the 4th place setting away. We reminded her once again that there were 4 of us. This does not bode well.  We ordered drinks, which took quite a while to arrive. We kept seeing the server taking food/drinks to other tables. Finally, another server brought us our drinks. The first server returns to take our order. We had decided to try the garlic fries appetizer - she asked if we wanted to place our dinner order, too. Sure, we said, as long as the appetizer and entrees don't come out together. No problem.Again we waited...and waited. Then, low and behold, our entrees arrive- served by yet again a different staff person (may have actually been the one who brought our drinks, I'm not sure.) I commented that I guess we weren't going to get our appetizer after all, and she was surprised & offered to take our food back to bring out the appetizer. Really??? Just leave the food and cancel the app.  Now for the food. Our order included the SOP Pizza (sausage, carmelized onion, roasted red peppers), The Egg Pizza and the Mac &Cheese. The SOP was tasty, crust was a bit soggy, though. The portion of the Mac & Cheese looked a bit small but was told it was good - not great, but good.  Overall, the service was lacking - I'm not sure a server is actually assigned to a table as it seemed new faces keep showing up at ours - very confusing. There was live music in the bar area - wasn't too fond of his music (but that's personal taste) but it was a bit loud to carry on conversation. Food was fine - again, not WOW, and for the pirce point, I would expect more.  I think the majority of the cars in the packed parking lot were for The Main Ingredient which is right next door (and has awesome food at a very reasonable price point!) Would I return? Maybe. But given other options, I'll probably go there.",

The pizza came out without pepperoni and had what I thought were onions.  It was fennel and not onions.  This was probably just a miscommunication of what I thought it was and the server thought.  They made us a pizza with just the pepperoni.  The pizza was okay it did not seem to be the same as I remember it.  I guess the place is under new ownership and they are coming out with a new menu.   We did order the shrimp appetizer and it was really good.    I will try their pizza once the new menu comes out.",

I ordered the sourdough burger and it is pretty good, but their definition of medium rear and mine are quite different. The bartender realized how red it was and sent it back, but the kitchen served the exact same redness a few minutes later. I don't mind rear, but this ruined the toasty sourdough which ended up being soggy and bloody.  Wine is good. Service at the bar is great.",

They have a daily lunch special of a four slice pizza and cup of soup or salad. There were 4 salads to pick from and two soups. All four of us enjoyed our meal and will be back! The parking was minimal during lunch and we had to park a ways away but it was worth it. Service was great and she kept all our drinks filled. The lunch specials are reasonably priced and filling!",

My wife said she didn't want any of the food when I left but when I got back, the smell enticed her to dig in. Pizza wasn't fancy just good but the shrimp aioli was gourmet good. Hopefully we will go back before we leave Scottsdale.",

I ordered the  \"express\" lunch and when I finally got the pep. pizza the crust was burned. I was short on time so I tried to eat around it but the bottom was uncooked so I sent it back. 20 more minutes and EVERYTHING was now burned. So they offered to make me another pizza (sorry I don't have an additional 20 mins) they \"adjusted\" the bill, apologized and let me walk away hungry and pissed off that I just paid $10.00, with the tip, it wasn't the waitresses fault the pizza chef couldn't cook! I've worked in this industry and they never should have recooked an already burnt pizza and then charged me for it! I will not be back.",

    "text": "I'd like to preface this with saying that I've only ever had positive experiences here the multitude of times I have been here. Although, I was lucky enough to receive the same server every time. I don't know his name but he was wonderful; however, this experience was so frustrating I felt the need to share in hopes management will become aware and make changes.   So a friend and I arrive last night at 6pm. It was not busy but a few others were seated. We choose a high top table next to the bar/pizza oven and are greeted by our server, ETHAN. He brought us water and said he would be back to take our drink orders.   This is where it goes downhill. We wait for about 10 minutes and he has not returned. We aren't in a rush and gave him the benefit of the doubt. He might be busy or doing things in the back. So he comes out, makes eye contact as I wave, and continues to walk by us. He continued to walk by us for another 15 minutes while making eye contact with me and passing directly next to our table. He then seats a table directly behind my chair and returns promptly to get their drink orders and appetizers, still ignoring us. Finally, around 6:30 he walks by the table. I proceed to get his attention as he stops and LOUDLY complains to another employee about how those customers were stupid and \"only tipped $7 what the hell\".   I continue to try to flag him down. Mind you, no drink orders had been taken nor our food order after being repeatedly ignored for FOURTY FIVE minutes. Then as he is bringing the table behind us their full meal, and we have been here almost an hour we get up and leave.  Ethan, if you somehow see this, serving is NOT a job you should have. You were rude and loud and awful.",

I am rating the cleanness of the restaurant when I was there a 1! There were birds jumping from table to table. The dishes were left at every table around me. Then the cold beer came and it got much better. I had their tuna salad melt sandwich which was good. I didn't care for their humble pie sausage minestrone.

When my pizza showed up (which was really yummy) she dropped it off and walked away when I flagged her down to ask for a side of ranch she looked and me and rolled her eyes. I looked at the guy next to me and was like \"wow she must like me\" he replied \"no she has been doing that to everyone one.\" Normally I'm a 20-25% tipper ( use to be a bartender, I get it), but after how rudely I was tried I didn't tip anything (which did hurt my heart) the guy that checked me out, showed me the receipt and the fact that I didn't tip...

They were overly greasy and the marinara sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce you'd dip your grill cheese in.

Waitress still doesn't come back and it was 1245 by now..I have already been there over an hour. I called my client and booked for 130. Finally at 1:10 I waited at the bar and the waitress rang me up there. It was pretty annoying and she did comp an item on our bill but didn't help the fact I couldn't make my 130 in time either. Tip to waiters, when business crowd comes in for lunch they usually don't have 2 hours for lunch. I was disappointed because everything else was good.",

By the time the night was over I had sampled it, cut my delicious burger in half to save for later, and liberally \"helped her\" finish her pizza into gone status. I was impressed and now I have a hard decision to make next time around on what to order.  Oh, we also got the lemoncello margarita and that was super as well.  Decently priced, amazing food.

We are \"locals\" from the Coronado neighborhood, so we are here at least once a week and we have visited at various times of the day. The one time service was slower than usual, our waiter apologized without us having to ask questions and he gave us a discount - nice touch.   As for the food, I am a big fan of the salads, especially the veggie salad, which is not the typical bowl of cold romaine lettuce with hunks of tomato and red onion. This one has enough ingredients to make it a satisfying meal. It is not cheap, but I couldn't make it at home for any less, considering everything that is in it.  A local's tip - go for happy hour and order a martini. The pomegranate with cinnamon is dangerously good, especially for the 4 bucks at happy hour. Add in a side of tempura green beans and you are good to go until dinner time.",

We waited, we looked at the menu again and decided on food, so by the time a server showed up we could order everything at once. We shut our menus and waited. Still nothing. Serveral servers passed us in the 20 minutes that we sat there and no one even came by to acknowledge us. Not a \"Be with you in just a minute\" NOTHING.

I didn't try the pizza, though it looked delicious, but since it's hard to mess up anything with burrata and I wanted something fresh- I went with the caprese.   The pesto was great, the burrata was of course really good as well and I liked the sour ciabatta it was served with. My only gripe was that it was hard to eat. I prefer fresh tomatoes, sliced. I found it a little difficult to get the delicious fresh taste of the ingredients in every bite with the roasted cherry tomatoes. I also just like the fresh flavor or raw tomato with the richness of the burrata and olive oil, and I guess the balsamic could be toned down.  However,  with all my gripes (everyone's a critic, right?), it was still very tasty, and the wine was decent and reasonably priced. I will return.",

My spouse ordered the chopped salad of which he ate every bite. My pizza was a white pizza with mushrooms and pancetta. I thought the fluffy pizza dough crust was very good. My spouse ordered the meatball pizza with a red sauce base. This pizza was very good too.",

A couple of managers came to explain that the glutten crusts are hard to bake and the outside curst may be crispy to ensure the center is not doughy.  We pointed out that the entire bottom of the pizza was black. They did remake both pizzas, but we still could not believe that they would serve pizza that was obviously burnt and then try to explain it away.",

Apps - Toasted Ravioli is delicious!  Bruschetta is even better.  The one made with apples, Brie, agave nectar and fig jam is just incredible.    Pizzas - all good!  I ordered the Pistachio which is a white pizza with leeks, onions, and Parmesan.  The pistachios are coarsely ground - not whole.  Probably a good thing!  I added mushrooms and Kalamata olives to it.  Delicious and perfectly baked, Neapolitan style in a wood fired oven.  So obviously, customization is not a problem.  Many thanks for that!  Parking lot is a little cramped during busy times but there is plenty of quiet street parking nearby - you won't have to hike a mile.    Service is spectacular!  They hire the NICEST people and they are perfectly attentive without being smothering.",

    "text": "My official vote would be 3.5 stars, but I rounded up because of the great service, friendly staff and enjoyable ambiance.    My friends and I grabbed Sunday lunch here.  I love Coronado Sunday brunch and lunch places.  Plus, you can head across the parking lot to the Main Ingredient Alehouse for a beer after and you'll be set for a great day!     I was craving a white pizza and my server recommended the Pear and Prosciutto.  However, I saw a pizza called \"Goat Cheese\" and I just had to have it.   I LOVE me some good goat cheese and pizza!    I salivated watching all the pies being served to the patrons around me and excitedly dug in when mine arrived.  It was good, but not mind blowing.  Goat cheese has all the potential to be mind blowing, so I was a little disappointed.  I would probably order it again, but lower my expectations a little bit.   It does have good flavor, just wasn't quite what I wanted it to be.     Be warned though, on my last performance review at work, I was told that I have unrealistically high expectations of others and myself, so I suppose that could apply to pizza too!  =)    My friend had the BBQ chicken pizza.  Now that is not a pizza I usually enjoy, but after we swapped a slice, I felt like it was pretty good!  It had a nice tangy flavor, a little heat/kick, and was pretty tasty.   My other friend had the sourdough cheeseburger and the fries.  I snuck a few fries - they were awesome!    Next time:  Pear and Prosciutto pizza. Let's see if the waiter did know best!  I'll get back to you and let you know how it goes!",

The atmosphere just doesn't seem to fit the food and service vibe. It is also interesting to me that this location gets the lowest YELP score of the Humble Pies - hard to put your finger on it, but something just doesn't seem right.  We were super excited to have another spot coming to downtown phoenix, but won't be returning.  It's seat yourself when you walk in and the staff was not overly friendly at first. Once we were seated our 2nd day on the job waiter came over to take our orders.  He was friendly and got our girls some kids menus and crayons.    We ordered 2 pizzas and  a bloody Mary. My husband got the Buffalo Chicken and said it was ok and I got the sausage which came with TONS of large onions.  I asked to have a new one since the menu didn't say anything about onions, he took it and then brought it back saying no,that just fennel...um no. But, whatever! So I just picked it off. The pizza was below average and our bill was $37 before tip for just the 2 pizzas and one drink - very over priced.  Our waiter did say to the table just over from us, sorry about the wait - \"It's a Hot Mess in here,or actually I am just a Hot Mess!\" Um Random!  They need to cleanup their act before this location closes",

This place gets 3.5 stars for the pizza, and 5 stars for its hospitality, atmosphere, and Bloody Mary.   Our waiter was so nice, you could tell he had a special place in his heart for Humble Pie.  The pizza was real good - but my stars are comparing it to all the great pizza I have tried around the globe - so for AZ... go give it a try!  Their Bloody Mary was AWESOME. It had basil and mozzarella cheese floating around it in - yum. Also, if you go, you have to get the garlic fries. They were cooked perfectly crispy, with just the right combo of garlic and cheese.  We had my 3 little cousins with us that range in age from 12 - 7.  Great for kids - they eat free on Sunday too! It was an overall great place for a nice relaxed sunday late lunch with the family.",

And that it what we got!  Our waitress quickly greeted us, brought us our sangria and wine, both were tasty and  the price wasn't bad. She was friendly, and did a great job.  The place was clean, with a warm glow from the pizza oven, it felt like a hug in there.  So nice.    We started with Bruschetta, it was good.Really the traditional tomato, mozzarella, basil, and balsamic shone, sometimes the original just cant be beat.  We then went on to the margherita pizza, something I had been craving for months since I had seen a picture of it in a Phoenix magazine.  Those beautiful dollops of mozzarella, rather than being drowned in rubber cheese, are the stuff dreams are made of. This pizza did not disappoint.  The other we tried was the Schreiners Sicilian Sausage, again, simple and delicious.    We really enjoyed our meal here, and will be back.",

The waiter took orders of people who came in after us, and was nowhere to be found most of the meal. I finally got up to ask about when our food would come out (we'd waited 20 minutes after finally getting to order), only to be told by the blonde woman working there that they had a new kitchen person so they were backed up. I brought the drinks for refills to the bar (which finally prompted the staff to come back to our table). We couldn't eat more than a soup/salad since we were so late, and we had to keep asking for boxes and our checks. It still took another 15 minutes to get out of there. I feel bad for the waiter, he seemed new and confused and wasn't getting much help. No offer of discounts (except for one of my team because they made his sandwich incorrectly). Don't bother going to this one.",

I've gotten three different martinis off their menu before and they aren't worth the price. Now I know just to get a glass of wine or their sangria is pretty good. Highly recommended!",

Candice offered service with a smile and even acted surprise at my boy's excitement at having lost a tooth just before we were served.

My boy (7) was the only kid in the place but he's cool. It's got a good happy hour from 11-6. I just missed it. Beer selection is limited but cocktails look mighty drinkable.   My son ordered off the kids menu (noodles with butter) which is always nice. Oh and kids eat free on Sundays! I ordered the artichoke pizza and it was really good. I love brick oven pizza with a soft crust, really good cheese, fresh veggies, and great seasoning. I added peppers and Parmesan to mine because I felt it needed a little more kick. Over all a great eating experience. Noise level was a little higher than I expected but considering the size of this restaurant and the number of tables in there it was understandable. Would have liked to hear the music a little more though. Sounded like good tunes.  I will definitely be back!  Xx, Reesie",

The Chicken Pesto Pizza was loaded with moist chunks of chicken breast smothered in a generous portion of pesto (pictured.) The crust was thin, yet, chewy, not crusty or dry. Yum!  The two flavors of Bruschetta (pictured) were fine, but nothing to write home about. It's not to be compared to that of a few other CenPho dining spots.  The salad (pictured) had a lovely presentation, but I didn't care for it. I'm not sure if it was the greens or the dressing, but it tasted a bit bitter to me.  Unlike some other reviews I read here, i had no issue with the service.  If it weren't for the salad and bruschetta, I'd have given Humble Pie five stars!",

    "text": "Manger was rude and had first refused to remake my order. I had place an order for the first time 3weeks ago, they messed up my pizza I believe I received somebody's else's pizza. I had originally ordered a margarita pizza and a pepperoni with 2 salads. When I got my order I had called right away and expressed my concerns letting them know my pizza was wrong, cold and missing cheese. They said they will remake it next time and had involved a manager and they took my name down. To my surprise today I called today to place my order and to go pick it up myself. I spoke to the manager I believe her name was Jennifer she was rude and said they never had a record of what had happend even though I gave her name and time and day of when I had originally placed my order she didn't want to replace my order we were going back and forth for 10 mins and I told her this is my first time you guys promised to fix it and instead I'm getting the runaround. Finally she agreed to replace it after how upset I was. I got there assuming I was getting what I paid for 2 pizzas and 2 salads and she told me sorry you didn't ask for the salads it's common sence i kept saying I paid a high end price to get what I pay for instead the whole experience was terrible. I will not use humble pie or refer them to my business associates. All I asked was my order to be fixed and for me to pick it up it was very simple task and could avoid losing a customer.",

    "text": "Eh. I don't know. Very mixed experience here.  Appetizer: Caprese burrata was very bitter, drenched in oil, and was not worth the price. I would definitely skip this.  Pizza: Tried the margherita, which was good. I liked the crust a lot - not too thin, not too thick, and cooked well. Toppings were fresh and nice.  Drinks: Tried some wine and beer. Prices were fine. Selection was fine. Nothing extraordinary.  Ambiance: Once again, fine. This place is probably good if you want to bring kids and/or a large group. Maybe not the most romantic restaurant if that's what you're looking for.  Service: Good. Our server was always attentive and polite.  Overall, I don't think I would ever be in the mood specifically for Humble Pie, but if my first choice restaurant was really busy with a long wait, I think Humble Pie would be a very solid backup that I would be happy to dine at. Given how good the margherita pizza is, I am hopeful the other pizzas are good too.",

    "text": "Every one of these stars was for the food. My husband and I joined 4 other couples for dinner on a Thursday night. They had a special and so we took advantage of the special and ordered Calamari, 2 salad and one small pizza to share, and we added in a bottle of wine, and everything was delicious. The Calamari was GREAT!  The wine was really good. And we had a very meaty meat loving pizza.  Yum.  No one had been to this restaurant before, it's still relatively new, so we were all delighted to find it was nicely air conditioned for summer dining and the space (while tight) was comfortable.    Our waitress was really nice, and very attentive. I was even more amazed when the cook came out to apologize to another couple for delivering their ravioli slightly frozen.  He brought out new ravioli and apologized personally for the issue.  What service!   Then it was time to settle up and leave and things got a little uncomfortable. Our host for the evening had a \"Groupon\" coupon.  He wanted to use that coupon and was denied because their bill (which had been done individually) was priced out at the \"special\" pricing.  Okay, so they didn't read the fine print, but the manager came by to explain that they couldn't see fit to use this coupon under any condition (not even the condition that the owner of the coupon brought in 8 other diners for a \"big party\" where they had put mandatory service charges on the bill.)  I get that a restaurant has to have rules for coupons and other specials, but they also have to take into consideration how uncomfortable this was for our host and how he really wanted to show off this cool place to his friends.   That was such a sad ending to a perfect meal!",

I told the waiter who apologized immediately, explaining that there are two types of marinara that they serve and we must have gotten meat by mistake. He asked if we wanted more mariana for our cheesy bread. With reserve, I said yes. It pretty much ruined the experience for me. I used my knife to explore the new mariana sauce for mystery meat floating in it.  They did not offer to comp anything - I had to ask. Most restaurant managers make the first move, but even when we suggested we should not have to pay for the dish he said he would \"see what he could do.\" In the end they did comp the dish, however the experience left a literal bad taste in my mouth...I would expect a more sincere response and sensitivity to various dietary restrictions.",

I could literally count on my hand how many olives were on my pizza....and it cost me an extra $2 to add olives!  For about 10 olives, $2.  No joke or exaggeration. And I could see more sauce than cheese.  Feel like I got ripped off for a $15 pizza that had only half the ingredients on it.

For $20, you can get an appetizer, a pizza, and two salads. It's a great deal!  We both really like their pizza - it's got this fantastic crust that is flavorful and both chewy and crunchy at the same time. A perfect combination! Plus, there's plenty of toppings to choose from - all forming fantastic pizzas.   The appetizers are pretty generic - fried calamari, French fries, caprese, green beans, etc. None stand out as amazing, but my husband really likes the calamari. Our favorite salad is the Strawberry and Gorgonzola. Our favorite pizza is the Roasted Mushroom as it has pancetta on it as well. Then for dessert we usually order their chocolate chip pizza cookie - warm with vanilla ice cream!      We normally sit at the bar, since the dining area can be full, but our bartender/waiter has always been super friendly and helpful. All of the staff here are really friendly and I always feel like I'm coming to hang out with the locals. This place has a great atmosphere!",

I haven't eaten outside on the patio due to the proximity to 7th St & all of its traffic.  I can visualize a quite, landscaped patio behind the restaurant, but then where would we park?  LOL!  That aside, I've enjoyed every meal I have eaten there - lunch, happy hour & dinner (plus pick-up!).  I live close enough to walk to Humble Pie & it has become a favorite hang in the 'hood!  The service is attentive, friendly & professional.  I'm looking forward to my next visit there - which will be in 2 days for lunch  Yum",

If you are craving for pizza and an amazing time come here, it's small but not too small interior gives me like urban wooden cabin feels? If that makes any sense to you review readers! But I like it, when you walk in you sit yourself anywhere you like actually. They always have a daily special and HH is daily too from 3-7pm drinks/ appetizers. So let's get into the food, definitely check out the basket of fries and let me tell you it was huge  for 4.50 you can't go wrong with skinny fries, seasoned to perfection. Also I love getting Margherita pizzas, so I ordered that, they have that item on the HH menu, you get a 10inch and shareable for about 2 people! It was just what I expected fresh and full of flavor! Draft beers and cocktail selections aren't that bad as well! Service was to a tee, awesome and on point. Other than that no complaints, obviously ! Definitely check this humble place out if your ready to dig in and enjoy friends companies or yourself! Ok Phoenix stay cool, stay hungry!",

He had to borrow my pen. Then HE STOLE MY PEN, and I never got it back. The food was bland and not very flavorful. There were no gluten free options. When I asked for garlic powder it was like I asked him for the moon. He didn't think they had any, so he went to go check, but he never even came back. The bill was so expensive and no alcohol was purchased. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The bathrooms were dirty and smelled of burnt crust. Coincidentally our crust was burt as well.",

We sat there waiting for at least 10 minutes until somebody came up and took our drink order. We decided on splitting the caesar salad, macaroni and cheese and margherita pizza. All the food came out in a timely manner which was a plus because we were starving. The salad was your typical caesar sald. The macaroni and cheese was DROWNING in sauce and looked disgusting, but the pizza looked decent. We dug in on the macaroni and cheese first which had no flavor and we had to fish for our noodles because there was so much sauce. The pizza was the only decent thing about this place.    Needless to say, there are much better pizza places out there so I will not be returning.",

The beer selection is a bit lame, but I'll survive. My only complaint would be that the two times we've been here, the food shows up too quickly... needs to be timed out better so we don't feel rushed.

I can't say much for the interior, I'm not a fan of exposing the bare bones of a building and calling it \"decor.\"  However, I still found it comfortable inside.  I ordered a Stella (on tap) and a margherita pizza.  The pizza was good.  I found the dough comparable to Red Devil, although, still not as good.  The sauce reminded me of this delicious spaghetti sauce that my mom learned how to make when she lived in Italy.  She uses grape tomatoes and that's what this sauce tasted like, I enjoyed it, I thought it added a nice flavor to the pizza.  By definition, a margherita pizza should have garlic, this one didn't have any.  The basil had been chopped up and again, the pizza typically calls for whole pieces.  All in all, I'd give the pie 3 stars.  I'm kicking in an extra star for the amazing service from Rizzo the bartender, he made my day.",

We were seated, decided on the caprese appetizer and the pistachio pizza.  When our appetizer came, it was a wide soup bowl with about an inch of olive oil in the bottom, a glob of mozzarella, about a half cup of basil pesto, 4 cherry tomatoes and a few slices of bread.  The mozzarella was so tough, we had to use a knife to cut it.  Trying to skewer little, round tomatoes one they've been rolling around in a bath of oil proved to be one of the least glamorous things I've done in a long time.  After wrestling with the appetizer for about 3 minutes, our pizza was brought to us, and it was COVERED in rosemary.  Now, I like spices as much as the next girl, but there was enough on the pizza to actually change the texture.  After eating half of each dish between the two of us, we decided to leave, sans take-out boxes.  My vote is leave the pizza to places like Cibo, P. Bianco and others who have proved themselves.  And as a side-note, please update the music selection for the folks who do dine there.  Bad 90's pop sprinkled with radio commercials isn't a help to the experience.",

Our watier was kind enough to warn us that the large salad was huge and he was right - the small version was what other restaurants call a dinner size and it was more than enough to share as an app.  When our waiter accidently forgot to bring out my boyfriends beer (which was really no big deal) he followed up with a complimentary drink as well as a small beer for me \"so I didn't feel left out\" :) We really aren't the type to care about a lost drink order but it's really nice when someone goes out of their way like that.

So we sat down at a clean table and waited to be greeted....and waited...finally about 10 minutes or so someone finally came by to take our drink order. It was definitely not busy. So we got a couple beers-some good beers on tap. Got the bruschetta and was very disappointed. I think I could make it better at my own home, but I knew they were known for there pizza so I went onto the next. Got a basic margarita pizza and it was good. Liked that the best of my visit there. I am a lover of ranch and they had the best ranch I've ever had. Over all I was not super impressed by my Humble Pie experience and will try other places instead of this.

We started with the green beans which were fantastic!  Perfectly seasoned, crispy, and a nice dipping sauce.  We then got two different pizzas, one with the schreiner's sausage, one marg with goat cheese added.  Both were fantastic, the crust was perfectly crisp on the outside, nice and chewy on the inside.  I had just visited parlor the week before and I could not say the same for the pizza crust there sadly.  We had a few glasses of wine, and with the groupon deal it was totally reasonable and I would return for sure!  They have live music on the patio Saturday nights also.",

That was probably our best experience. We had the SOP pizza (tasty) and the Shrimp pizza (just ok). We have been to the 7th Street location several times and also ordered to-go a couple times. Last night we ordered the wings, wedge salad and prosciutto and pear pizza to-go. The wings did not have enough sauce and were dry. The prosciutto on the pizza was super thick, not quite what I was expecting.  The wedge was good, and consistent with all the other times I'd ordered it. I think Humble Pie is really best for eating in the restaurant. By the time you get it home, everything is cold and the wings didn't seem to be the same as when we eat them at the restaurant.Not really worth the $35 for a small pizza and a few small items. I will say  I've had the goat cheese pizza on several occasions and it has been good every time. The service is always good at Humble Pie and the atmosphere is casual yet trendy. I will be back!",

I love the food, it's awesome and the goat cheese pizza is heavenly. I typically sit at the bar and did again of my visit. I have to say, I like the restaurant a lot better when the Asian bartender isn't working. She is just not personable and always looks like she is going to blow a gasket.  I found out that she is the manager. She needs to pull it together. On on visit we were greeted by a lisa or lea, regardless, she was awesome and took care of us. Everything was on-time and perfect. I also like the busers/food runners. It's really hot in that kitchen and small, but they are always so pleasant when bringing the food around. That bartender should take a tip. It's the details and food that keep me coming back. All and all, eat at Humble Pie. It's quaint, delicious, and typically great service. Don't forget to eat a pazookie for dessert!",
