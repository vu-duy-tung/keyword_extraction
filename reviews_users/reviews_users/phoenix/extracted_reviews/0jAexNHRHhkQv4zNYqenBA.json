They were both wearing GUCCI sneakers.  The tattooed security guard wearing a Cake shirt said they were underdressed.  Not even 5 minutes later they let in a white guy in Adidas.  You're frickin kidding me.  Way to make it obvious as hell that their skin color was the reason and not their attire. I used to love getting tables here but never again.  Stupid pretentious bar, you just lost my business.  Now I've realized why all my friends used to cringe when I'd say \"let's get a table at Hefe!\"  Maybe y'all should stop catering to the college scene and go for people who actually have money.  Racist as hell",

That's funny there is absolutely no one waiting and she states there is a waiting list. She then says you can go somewhere else if you want too...WHAT you have to be kidding me.

I'll grant you that I'm more than a little biased against 'clubs' in general (I'd rather relax, talk, and laugh than get bumped around, shout, and pay $15 for a whiskey after waiting in line for 15 minutes).   That being said, this place is the worst of the worst as far as clientele goes. Every Phoenician has heard of the $35K / year Scottsdale millionaire. Well, this is where they all come on Friday and Saturday nights to take on more crushing credit card debt so they can pop some bottles and impress some trashy women.   Are you a male in your twenties that likes cranberry mixers, works in 'finance' (read: entry level teller at Chase), leases a 328i, is not above slipping something in a girl's drink, and pretends to be some kind of pseudo-cowboy hardass at Country Thunder once a year? Then you'll love it here among your friends.  Are you a woman that is attracted to the aforementioned Scottsdale Bro? You'll love it here as well.",

We were sat and the server came over to get our drink order, which was probably the only good thing of the night. My boyfriend got his beer, but I didn't get my water. We didn't see our server....or any other server.....for some time. We were ready to get up and just leave, but instead I asked a food runner to grab our server who we hadn't seen. A different server came over to take our order and finally bring me water after having to request it again. We got our food and aside from a manager checking on us as we both had our mouths full, nobody very stopped by our table again. We never received the check.....I had to ask for it after having waiting for far too long. I continued to see our original server not working the entire night. She was either flirting with a table of guys across from us or hugging and hanging out with a guy right in front of us at the bar. I understand these girls are young and working in a bar tends to include flirting.....but do your job. Make sure your guests are being taken care of. It was completely unprofessional and I won't be going back because it took over an hour to eat dinner when it should have only taken about 30 minutes. I almost didn't tip, but the server who ended up taking over most things was running around to other tables, so I didn't want to leave her nothing. She also wasn't attentive, but she at least helped us out some and was actually doing work related things. The good definitely isn't good enough to try and put up with such terrible service.",

Out of no where, two Mexican chicks and two white chicks are being dragged out of the bathroom by the neck! . The bouncer kept grabbing and groping her on the way out, not to mention that he had her in a full choke hold and she looked like she was ready to pass out. As I am sitting outside, the fat bastard, racist son of a bitch fuck starts making unnecessary comments. He started calling the poor chick a heifer, a beaner, a wetback on other things. I was offend and  called him out, to which he told me to shut the fuck up or leave if I didn't like it. After all, this is \"El Hefe, Super macho taqueria\" priding themselves on Mexican food and drinks. I think it was bull shit so I told the guy to let go of the girl and he said that I could go back to Mexico with them. I closed out my tab, they called the cops, i think one of the girls got arrested and I never heard back from the manager after I emailed him. The owners might have the best intentions, but staff and management run this place like they own it. Bunch of lame ass bouncers making 10 bucks an hour on a power trip. I might have not gotten a table there that night but I had before. Either way, my tab was about 200 bucks plus tip, which I think would be enough to pay for the bastards salary for a month.   I wrote this review because i was there this past weekend. I looked over at HiFi and saw that there wasn't too much activity, so i decided to give El Hefe a try and get a table there instead. I was disgusted to see this idiot working there, so I went back to HiFi and had a great time there. I REALLY hope that management sees this review and they take action.",

Only one problem is that the line for guys is extremely long and unless you go early enough so you don't have to wait, that's the only way you're getting in.. Well that's unless you're a good looking woman then you're always getting in.. Great place though!!",

They have happy hour from 3-7 every day with $2 tacos and 3$ Dos XX as well as $5 specialty margaritas. Tons of TV's and a nice patio in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. The bartender was great and very quick. All of the tacos I tried were very good. I will go back and try more items again. P.S. LOVE the fake mustaches they provide free of charge. Mucho funo.",

Well over 1,000 made the trek to AZ to come and spend money, yet they wanted no part in that. The weird thing is that supposedly they arranged with us to have a 10% off tab (along with Whiskey Row) but that never came to fruition. I can say, however, our waitress was awesome! Some of the best customer service! The music was lame and the food was even worse. The chips and salsa was the highlight of the meal. They need a complete revamp of their menu and need to put someone in the back who can actually cook.",

Every time we go we order so much stuff.   1.Queso Dip with the amazing little tortillas and chips 2. Bottomless Mimosas (which have gotten kind of expensive). You still have to pay like a penny after the first one just a FYI 3. Carne Asada street tacos, fish tacos, and pork tacos (not for me). And last but not least the best ever  The Churro French Toast with Prickly Pear Cactus syrup.  Honestly we probably only drive 45 minutes for the French toast because brunch can be cheaper so many other places but it's THAT good. Make sure you call before you go to verify they're having brunch otherwise you might be heavily disappointed.   Also on my birthday they always give me a few shots. Super cool.",

    "text": "I had some colleagues that were in town on business and I wanted to take them out and experience the entertainment district in old town Scottsdale. We decided to get a table with bottle service at El Hefe and I should mention everyone had a great time that night. Here is where the problem started. The following morning my business partner realized he had left his phone at the table since he was contacted by a Michael who happened to be the GM of the club. I was in contact with Michael the following day and he mentioned that they were not open until 4pm and that I could come in and speak to a Jessica or \"Jess\" to pick up the phone (this was around 3pm). When I walked in I asked to speak to \"Jess\" and when she greeted me she was completely rude and told me they were not open and she was busy since they were preparing for an inspection. She then proceeded to tell me that I would have to wait or just come back later. I understand they were not open but I proceeded to tell her Michael said I could come in said Jessica would be able to help me. She told me no and I would have to wait. I stood by the bar and she completely ignored me for about 10-15 minutes. In observing what was going on it looks like she was just doing pre-work and helping the bartender get ready to open at 4pm. I then text the GM Michael back and he said he was sorry and would call her. Of course she did not answer so he text me back and said he would just come down to meet me in about 10 minutes. Finally after waiting about 20 minutes she finally went to get the phone. I understand they were busy but it literally took her 30 seconds to walk over to lost and found and get out the phone. In walking in I was prepared to tip the bar $30 dollars as a form of gratitude for holding the phone. I understand groups come in often and spend money but after spending $500 on a table you would think they might treat you with a little more respect. Jessica was extremely rude and I would never hire someone with her attitude to work for me. I know I'm giving this review a single star but I have to tell you Michael was extremely professional and helpful hopeful this note here will ensure the staff treats there customers with a little more respect, especially Jessica.",

Thank goodness my group of friends have gradually moved to different bars other than Hefe now. The only reason why we would visit Hefe, is to walk by it and say hi to our good pal Taylor.   Other than that, always treated horribly by bartenders and the security inside-they are so aggressive! And I wish the managers would be managers haha",

(RN & Law Enforcement) As you walked up to El Hefe, we were greeted by two security guards one with (beard & hat ) and one who was (slightly taller with the beard).   We were both excited with our ID's out and ready.   The security guard (beard & hat) in his nicest voice stated to my husband that he couldn't get into El Hefe because he had on high top sneakers.   We weren't happy but we obliged as we walked back to the car. We can hear our friends yelling  \"Are you guys coming back?\" Of course we are...  We walked to the car (which was two blocks away) and my husband changed into a different pair sneakers.   We walked back to the front of the line at El Heffe and the security guard w/ (tall w/ beard) states that \"We couldn't get in because of my husband's sneakers\".    WAIT.......Are you kidding me!  We were just here 10 minutes ago and spoke to the first security guard (beard & hat) who stated \" if you change your sneakers to lower top sneakers, you can get it\".    \"Is this a joke\" I stated. As I'm standing there  I looked to my left and there's two young Asian gentleman one had high top sneakers on and he was will denied access into the El Hefe.   The security guard proceeds to tell me that another security guard had gotten fired because he let someone into the club with high tops on. At that moment, I had sympathy and empathy for the security guard and the situation he was put into!    We were ready to leave......  Well to my surprise, two caucasian gentleman come walking out with (You..Guessed it)  HI TOP SNEAKERS!!! I was INFURIATED!!!!!   I looked at  the security guard and said  \"Ok, Now those two Caucasian gentlemen can out with high top sneakers on because I wasn't the security guard that let them in!!!  WHAT!!! I'm a little confused\"!! My husband said \"Look (showing his badge) I'm an officer of the law all I want to do is see the fight it shouldn't be a problem.   All of the sudden the Asian gentleman to the left of me whisper in my ear \"Watch this\"! He tells the security guy \"I'm gonna buy bottles so I suggest you let me in or I'm going to take my business elsewhere\"!!!  The security guard immediately disappears into the back...two minutes later he's telling us all to wait on the side while the manager (Bottle table Mgmr).   A dark haired young gentleman comes out and states \"Are you really going to buy a bottle\" the Asian gentleman said \"Yes, I'm definitely going to buy a bottle\" And I'm sure you guessed it!!!!! WE were ALLOWED into the club an ASIAN and a AFRICAN AMERICAN with HIGH TOP SNEAKERS ON!!!! We were personally escorted  into the club by the table bottle manager.   We ordered Ciroc with a craft of cranberry and seltzer water, nachos, loaded fries.... Etc! All of a sudden we're being treated like ROYALTY not like the MINORITIES who had on HiGH TOP SNEAKERS!!!!  People.....we're in 2015..... Do minorities still have to buy bottles and have tables service to enjoy what we all should get  EQUALLY!!!!!   El Heffe really made a bad choice in discriminating on the wrong people last night; little did they know people know people... DIDDY, Sickamore, DE..... Etc...If you known the entertainment business you know word gets around. I would NEVER, EVER GO BACK!!!!!   We the people ( every ethnicity )help these establishment to make money! I would treat every person like their worth TABLE SERVICE!!!!  It's about treating people fairly and equally and El Hefe didn't do that.....!!!!",

I walked in wanting to fix my makeup, then figured I should pee.... I saw something funny (a girl on her knees and a guy standing over her) the security was standing by the door he knew what was going on but didn't do anything until I pressured him to get them out.   I banged on the stall that the 2 were in and the guy getting the bj blew up on me and started cussing me out, at that point I was so pissed I just walked out and I think the security thought I was going to tell the manager or something bc he got told the couple that their time was up.

I came here many times and never had a better time until they accused my boyfriend of throwing up all over the floor even. After this was unproven they continue to tears us like we were nonexistent but it didn't matter. After these dumb severs found out who did it, they never expressed gratitude towards us and I feel bad for this bar because they have terrible services. Unless you are a single white man with a lot of money don't expect anything from this shitty bar.",

Every time I have gone the bartenders walk straight past me, or look right at me and walk away while. I'm trying to order a drink. I always noticed. All of there bartenders. Have that stereotypical white skinny look. So there does not appear to be much diversity there. I wouldn't recommend this place to go at all. The only positive note I have to say is that the music is good 60% of the time.",

Our server was really on point, she had bottles waiting for us once we finished the one we had. She was pouring heavy, but didn't mind when we started making our own, she had mixers restocked as fast as we ran out.   This place is effinggg loud. The bar girls blow whistles along with the music. This was really annoying at first, but hey, when you're drunk and fist pumping, honey badger don't care. It's a blast. As long as you are sloppy drunk and falling over, they don't care if you dance on the platforms between the booths. Everyone is just there to have a good time.",

I have been to this bar in the past and it was always super packed so this time I was excited since the traffic was slower. Upon arriving we attempted to get drinks at the bar. I've been to bars in the past to know that there is always going to be a bit of a wait when ordering drinks but something was off about the wait time we experienced. A person from our group tried to get the bartenders attention, he made eye contact with him and the bartender went straight to the person to our right to get their order. We figured maybe he just didn't see us so we kept waiting and listening to music. As soon as he was finished he walked the end of the bar and as he was on his way back to our side, he made eye contact with us again but went to the group that was to our left that just had walked up and began to took their order. Now I know he was choosing to ignore us because we had yellow helmets on and bowls attached to our heads with green slime (for our 90's costume) so it would be pretty difficult not to see us in a crowd let alone a bar. We had been waiting so long and were so shocked that we were being ignored that we ended up asking that same group to order our drinks for us. When he came back with the bill and grabbed it and thanked him for finally making our drinks. The more we stood there the more I paid attention to the fact that it wasn't just that we were apart of the 90's crawl but perhaps a race issue as I noticed that a group of really pretty Hispanic girls near by trying to order drinks were receiving the same type of service as we were. It was so bad that another person not soon after asked if we wanted them to order our drinks so we could get service quicker.The bartenders name was Mike B. and the way he treated us and I can only imagine others is unacceptable and needs to be dealt with.",

It's like a middle ground between The Lodge and Dos Gringos.   On a regular Friday or Saturday night El Hefe is a good place to get a quick drink or to just hang out. There always seems to be somewhere you can sit down or hang out at this place, unlike some other bars.   I also went here on NYE and it was very fun. Paid a cover charge and then drinks were a penny all night.   The vibe of the bar is half undergrad Spring Break, half an episode of Miami Ink. However, the service is good and the drinks are strong. Don't let the D-bag outer layer deter you for giving El Hefe a shot. I have yet to try the food, but I am doubtful with all of the options in Old Town I would ever choose to come to El Hefe for their food.",

I was able to get a bite or two to eat, and the food is great it was really fresh, and didn't feel to heavy, just the perfect type of atmosphere if you're looking to have fun with a group of people, or even stop on by for dinner ( which I might consider next time I come back to AZ) Must admit the lemon drops were the best drink of the night for me! highly recommend making this a stop on your weekend and enjoying both the food, and the club.",

The bartenders, management, and bouncers were all rude, slow, and extremely pretentious.    The place is very dirty (wet floors, dirty table tops).  I felt like I was at a fraternity house.

They don't have televisions set up everywhere like a sports bar (if that matters to you), but it got the job done.  Me and my buddy ordered some nachos with steak (I'd recommend splitting if you order it) and it was pretty good. Then tried the carne asada and duck tacos: i'd give the slight edge in flavor to the duck taco. All the tacos are pretty small FYI.  Service was also OK, waitress was pretty nice.

Last time I check bribing was against the law. Hire new door guys who is not associated with same douchy Scottsdale crowd so everyone get a chance to experience this place. Customer service starts at the door el Hefe management team not at the table. Till then I will take my money somewhere else...",

I asked if it was 21 and older and was told by the hostess not if we came in before seven. So, our group met at 6:30 for dinner.  The bouncer and manager were both at the door. They were both two of the biggest douche bags ever. The manager laughed and said \"you are in the Entertainment District,\" you are not getting in here with a child. Hmmm, isn't this why I called ahead and asked?  The manager went on to say if we were going to buy a bottle we could stay. Um, really?  What a joke. You might want to state your policies on your website so those of us who are not as cool as your establishment will know to go to far better places and not mess with your inconsistent policies.",

    "text": "I wasn't expecting a ton from the food at El Hefe, a newish Old Town Scottsdale spot serving up Mexican eats. I figured the bar, which turns into a hopping nightlife destination on weekend nights, would be more notable for its drinks than its cuisine, and I was right.  Not that the place doesn't look hella cool. It had lots of hot pink accents, including pink lighting and pink walls, which I loved even though it sort of reminded me of the now-closed Pink Taco.  I also thought the art-covered skateboards covering up the walls were neat, as well as the giant drawings of a Mexican wrestler and a Dia de Los Muertos-like skull adorning one of the walls.  Don't go there just to dine, though. While there were lots of televisions broadcasting sports, and the margaritas were impressive, I was left wanting a lot more with the food. It was too bad the $8 house margarita, at a whopping 20 ounces, couldn't set the standard for the meal, since that drink was such as killer deal.  The chips and salsa weren't too bad. The chips were nothing to shout about, but I liked that they were served on a cute cutting board spread along with three different types of salsa-chunky and mild, green and a spicy red. I did like the salsas, although I would have preferred the chips were a little thinner. They were only $3, though, which was pretty cheap, although most places would serve them up for free.  My friend and I tried a couple of the Grilled Mushroom Calabacitas tacos ($3 each). They were filled with lots of veggies, including zucchini and onions, but they were bland and sort of awkward to pick up and hold because the tortillas were tiny compared to the filling. Add a ton of salsa to them to give them a little kick.  We also each had a cheese quesadilla ($7 each). The quesadilla was pitifully tiny, and it was served on wax paper, which caused all the melted cheese to get stuck. These were one of the biggest rip-offs I've had, and the presentation was very bare bones, despite the addition of unappetizing pickled baby carrots and a drizzling of goat cheese creme.  There were a couple other things to note about the visit-the napkins at El Hefe seemed to be coming apart and left white threads all over my friend's and my jeans-not cool if you're planning on going clubbing in Old Town later. The bartender checked his cell phone more than he checked on us-clearly, we weren't his first priority. And the menu was really difficult to read, with backwards letters and all-caps. I know that's a weird thing to notice, but just looking at it gave me a headache.  All that said, skip El Hefe for dinner, and head to the cute and trendy spot for happy hour every day from 3-7 p.m., when those giant margaritas are only $5. Enjoy the ambiance while you drink, and go to here, here, or here in Old Town for dinner instead.  UPDATE: Justin, the director, reached out to me about my review, which I think is very classy and shows that he values customer service. I'm going to try out their dining options again, for sure.",

    "text": "So I seem to have a love-hate relationship with this place. At times I love it and at times I hate. Lately it's been the latter of the two unfortunately. Going here for food wasn't bad. In fact, it was delish, but going here and experiencing the night life has not been awesome as it once was. While it is in part due to the people that go here - a bunch of douchey guys and the girls that go with them (it is Old Town) - I can deal with them cause mixed in there are some cool people. What I can't deal with are some of the people working there, starting with the door guys who seem to relish the power and enjoy letting people know it. And if they weren't bad enough, let's get into the bartenders.   I've known some bartenders and I did the whole bar tending thing and no where in all that I learned and know, did they mention giving people crap service. I get it, you're busy and you get slammed, but you get through it and they should want to take and make as many drinks as they can rather than being all selective and choosing certain people over others. I'm sorry, I don't want to swoon over the bartenders, I just want my drink. And, when they finally decide to deign me with their presence and place my order, they get it wrong. And trying to flag them back over after they hand you your bill to point out the mistake wasn't even worth trying since trying to get their attention the first time too a bit of work.   The servers were all right; haven't had anyone exceptional to rave or rant about. The music is usually pretty awesome. And as I've said, there are some pretty awesome people worth going back for, as well as their food. I do enjoy their happy hour menu. I just know that before going to El Hefe, I need to start out somewhere else if I want a drink and then head over, as is the usual plan when we go out.",

Afterwards we came back to Hefe for an after dinner drink. It was a good party. The bar was super busy, and I had one of those moments where I felt like the bartender wouldn't serve me because I was a lady. LOL. Don't you hate that, ladies?   Anyhow, we got our drinks, and we had a few. We watched the fight on the TVs and danced, as the music was pretty GOOD! it was packed though and you had to fight through the crowds to move around.

    "text": "THIS PLACE WILL TAKE YOUR CASH AND STILL CHARGE YOUR CARD.  I go to Old Town on a weekly basis; I am young and love to have fun, who doesn't?! I have never had any issues in old town until my birthday bash at El Hefe. My friends and I wanted to get a table with bottle service because hey, you only turn 26 once. Now, I knew gong in how much the table was, I brought the cash along with my friends who were pitching in too. However they wanted my card to hold the table, which left me a little anxious, I told the manager \"Don't charge my card, I have cash for this table\" he understood with a head nod and said \"of course.\" I am introduced to our little petite blonde waitress/bartender, I also tell her \"Bring me the check and I'll pay for this table with cash, just do not charge my card.\" She understood and said \"Okay, no problem.\" As the night goes on and drinks are pouring, our waitress gave me the bill with my card and ID, I gave her the cash, didn't sign anything, told the waitress, \"Here is the cash\" and she left, didn't see her the rest of the night. Saturday morning I see a charge on my card for $254.50! So she took my cash, along with all my other friends who pitched in and still charged my card. I called the bar, no answer. Disputed with my bank... big help there ... and now I am here, warning you, fellow yelpers, that there are plenty of other bars in old town, mill avenue, desert ridge, west gate, and downtown, just as good, not as crowded, and not a huge rip off from any bartenders or managers.   Am I bitter? ... Yes ... Will this stop me from having fun? ... No but if I can prevent another person getting ripped off like I did, well this post was worth it. Good luck! Be safe! and check your bank accounts in the morning, just in case ;)  Oh and almost forgot, Ryan Hibbert (managing partner for the El Hefe, Whiskey Row, etc) I will be posting on multiple review sites to bring awareness of the service these bars are giving.

    "text": "This place is confused. It wants to be a sports bar, restaurant and dance club and as a result, it does none of them very well.  The food (I had the $3 tacos during happy hour) was decent, but nothing remarkable or earth shattering. The $3 beers were a hit with our group, but to a person (there were six of us), no one had anything nice to say about their food. Just sorta good, but not great.  Other than having some TV's which you can't hear over their music, I don't see how they can call themselves a sports bar...that doesn't even make sense. Maybe it changes during football season, but it isn't anything like a sports bar at the moment.  As for a dance club, we didn't stay to see it, but there is a large rectangular bar in the middle of the place and a DJ station at one end. I guess the dance floor would be between the DJ and the end of the bar which is not a large space. They were preparing for bottle service while we were there, and the wait staff was preoccupied.   Overall, I think this place needs a manager who cares about customer service enough to impart that to the employees, because it feels like they believe that you should be grateful to be there and not the other way around.",

The woman next to me was patiently waiting to have her order taken from the bartender. After helping everyone around her, the girl asked if she could please order a drink. The bartender girl flipped out and called security. The woman leaned over to me and calmly told me that she is so sorry, and to not be frightened but she thinks she's about to get kicked out. I watched all of this go down and it absolutely disgusts me, they had no reason to treat her that way. The first time I went here was with a group and the doorman let in everyone except our black friend \"because he had a white tshirt on.\" I am a female and I was wearing a white tshirt. I said this to the bouncer  and he then added that he cant let him in because of his chain (a small fitted cross necklace under his tshirt). I'm really tired of these night club workers thinking they are gods. Treat people with respect no matter their color.",

Walked into el hefe, there were only two other parties there other than us. We were excited to get fast, efficient service but got just the opposite. There were four waitresses and one bartender. We sat at the bar. It took 15 minutes for the bartender to even acknowledge we were there. When she did, she did not say hello and ask what we wanted, she stood there staring at us. We told her our order. It took another ten minutes for her to pour our drinks. She thought it was more important to go check her phone first. The waitresses and the bartender were on their phones the whole time acting like they didn't even care to attend to the people in the restaurant. Keep in mind, there's only two tables there and we were the only ones sitting at the bar. It was VERY disrespectful and unprofessional. We got up and left. As people were coming in, we told them to not even bother. I will never be back, nor will I recommend this place to anyone.",

A security officer was standing right there watching him so I asked him if he was going to do anything. Keep in mind at this point my shirt is visibly wet with alcohol from this. The security guy asks me who it was and I point him out. He then stands there and does nothing. After a few minutes, I asked him \"are you going to handle this or no?\"  He just put his hands up and said \"what am I going to do?\"  Seriously??  I understand the bar makes money off of the private tables so you don't want to throw them out. But he could've at least spoke to them or faked it and at least pretended to do his job. Lucky for him we are an even tempered group as had we approached the other group and handled this ourselves the \"security\" staff would be lucky to have the skills to call 911 let alone do their job.    I'll never return to a bar that can't even hand the drunks they create.",

The tacos are fine, nothing special, but then again I wasn't expecting anything special. The drinks are of average price and decently strong. I've only been here on Fridays and Saturdays, both nights the DJ tends to spin pretty good music. It's VERY crowded during peak hours and the line can get somewhat long. More than once I've been overlooked at the bar and that's annoying. The bartenders do seem to be doing their best though during busy times. I know damn well one of their door guys recognizes me (my tattoo is very recognizable) and he got snippy with me when he was checking my ID and I had my sleeveless hoodie on during a rainy night. Policy I'm sure, but c'mon dude, I've given you a enough of my business for a better attitude.  Also, you should befriend the head of security, Corell. He's a super duper nice guy but will fuck you up if you mouth off!",

We tried a lot of things on their menu, but I must say the maragarita with the jalapenos was my favorite margarita. It was so fresh and tangy.   The taqueria style street tacos were killer!!! two words Beef Cheek! I definitely recommend them. The Duck were awesome too.   The Carne Asada torta was killer good as well. just really big! My hubby and I split everything and were there from about 5pm until 8 or so and it was a good time.   Fun people watching as well.

We were all mid splitting up the card, got interrupted, turned around and what do you know someone snatched up the bill and put it ALL on my card. ALL 8 people's orders food drink ALL of it on my card. Some of the items I was charged for we didn't even receive as we had been \"forgotten\". So I ended up having to go through the hassle amongst 8 people's orders and my debit card and cash when this all could have been avoided if she hadn't so hastily ran to swipe my card out without even reading any notations I had made on the receipt or even simply asking if we were finished. It was all so quick and all so inconvenient. I had been to the Tempe location and I really enjoyed myself and the food.

Most of the time I have a pleasant experience. But, the last time I came in, I did not enjoy myself nearly as much. I came in with three friends, and they did not have any tables inside, so we decided to sit on their patio which was very hot (not their fault, damn this weather). At first we tried to track down a server, but were unable to, so we ordered drinks from the bar. This took a very long time, and the bartenders seemed more interested in talking to each other than serving patrons. It was relatively busy, but waiting fifteen minutes is a bit much to ask. Finally, once we got our drinks we grabbed a couple menus and were finally able to track down a server. It seemed like she was the only server for the entire restaurant. We ordered our food and it came out in around 20-25 minutes. The food was pretty good, but when my girlfriend asked for her tab she was given the wrong credit card. It then took another fifteen minutes to track down the server again, and she gave her the right credit card back. She wasn't exactly friendly. I'll be back because I like this place, just not to sit down and eat.  4 stars at night 1.5 stars for lunch",

    "text": "Meh.  I was eager to check out this venue simply because my friends used to tell me amazing anecdotes about this place when it first opened. I finally had the opportunity to go there, and I have firmly decided this is not my cup of tea. I have not tried any of the food here so I can't give you a honest review about the whole experience, other than what I experienced as a pseudo alcoholic. Hmmm...where do I begin? Ah, yes. Let's discuss the clientele. Before I proceed, I am throwing a little disclaimer out there so I won't step on any feelings...I have a tendency to utilize the word \"douchebag\" a lot. It's a part of my daily vocabulary. Honestly, can you blame me? I live within close proximity of the watering hole of these aforementioned creatures that seem to spawn at an alarming rate. So, if you are easily offended, you may want to gloss over my review and make the more favorable ones your focal point. The bartenders, from what I can recall, were not very prompt in answering drink orders. I remember waiting around, locking eyes with the bartenders and feeling slightly pathetic. My heart isn't pitter pattering over your Adonis-like looks, Mr. Bartender. I am in need of a beverage to quench my thirst, and it would please me greatly if you could ask me what my little heart desires. The place is also quite small, and for anyone that easily gets claustrophobic, it may present a huge problem. It gets packed during the weekends, and you will be the victim of numerous foot steppers. By the end of the night, you can boast to your friends about your battle wounds. Granted, as with any bar/club, it is a common occurrence. All in all, this place is something I can take in doses. I have heard from numerous friends that the happy hour is decent, so perhaps I will harbor no ill feelings and check it out at a decent hour. Like a moth to a flame, I find myself strangely drawn to this place. I may not like it very much, but we always stop there. It just might be one of those mysteries of life that will go unanswered for generations to come.",

It caught my attention with the fun atmosphere and the drinks!  I saw a picture of the salty chihuahua which is like a spicy margarita and I was sold!  We arrived on a Sunday but earlier in the day when there were less people.  But when we left I could tell the party was just about to get started.  We got carne asada fries and being from San Diego, where we basically INVENTED them, :) I was pleasantly surprised. They added like a green chile or nopales on top which I thought was a cute Arizonian touch. Our bartender/server was really awesome and attentive not to mention drop dead gorgeous. The girls that work here are all really pretty. Props to her though because she was so attentive and I really appreciate that. She had like a blue and green bikini top that looks like a bra. Anyway, such a cool area to visit if you're in scottsdale for the weekend and want to PARTY! :)",

    "text": "El sucko. I need negative stars. While visiting AZ we ended up in this section of town and looking for something Mexican like. The menu looked ok so we thought we would try it.  -For a Friday at 8pm it was dead and it felt like they weren't expecting patrons when we walked in. The host was kind of lounging couldn't tell if he worked there or just a guy sitting in a booth. -LOUD giant tv wall was cool but couldn't hear the soft spoken waitress or ourselves when she finally came over after not realizing we were one of her tables. -Two tables of fist bumping bro's seemed to get get the attention of the overwhelmed waitresses vs. the other couples or patrons. -One of our diet sodas came to the table flat twice. -They ran out of iced tea after trying to switch from flat soda. -They screwed up one of our meals. -The place seemed dirty and being open was an afterthought. Like when people show up unannounced and you are forced to entertain them.  -We paid cash while the other couple with us used credit and had to wait 10 minutes until the register was free because the other table of 12 bro's was overwhelming the hunt and pecking waitress on the cash register.  Our beers were cold, my tacos were ok but definitely not \"amazing\" like the other posters have stated. Really? People use the word amazing to describe this place? What's up with the crazy decor ? Is it a sports bar, strip club or a Mexican place? If you want pseudo Mexican with adult portions and service you are better off going to Chili's or Quedoba.  Couldn't imagine the service if this place was full. We left there annoyed and wishing we searched harder for another place to grab food and drink.",

Back in those goo days I would have rated this place at 4 stars. But the last few times I have been here to go out, the guy bartenders have acted like the roided out frat bros they truly are. Not only have I been overcharged for drinks two weekends in a row, but when I confronted the bartender about it this time he started yelling and cursing at me in front of my two friends (I bought 3 drinks) about how wrong I was. Bad experience to say the least.   The only reason this place isn't a 1 star business now is because the front door man Taylor is a class act and a True professional when dealing with issues as opposed to the primal animals behind the bar. He is the only reason my friends and I might come back in the future.",

The service was friendly however multiple items we did not order appeared on the bill at first, when I asked that it be corrected some were taken off (but not all, the remaining once were small things and our bill was around $100 so I did not bother), then noticed that multiple of the prices were different on the menu then on our bill (mostly by a dollar or 2 off, but it was on a couple different items.) Waitress was confused but didn't bother to get a manager to clear things up, we just paid and left because the 6 dollar difference (Originally 18) was not worth the struggle and we don't go out in Old Town that often.  The food was decent, some in my party thought the breakfast burrito was rather small, another person was told they no longer carried the item on the menu  they wanted to order from it. I normally tip well over the 20% gratuity when I go to a place to watch a football game, in this case since the bill was wrong I just paid the gratuity and did not leave the extra I would have left after being at a table for over 3 hours. Disappointing that they did not have their advertised specials and that the bill prices and menu prices did not add up. The huge LCD screens are cool but they need to get their act together",

The drinks are served in plastic cups and house well drinks taste like rubbing alcohol but still cost about $8. It gets disgusting in the summer because it's just way too crowded and the patio stays open to the bar. All they play is crappy top 20 EDM. DJ never takes song requests and just picks his nose behind a lap top. The only reason I ever came back to this dump is because of the group I was with, but next time I'd rather go home early.",

The next time we went we had a group of 9, we were sitting at two tables. I asked our waitress at the beginning of the dinner if she would do two checks to which she said she couldn't even though the other table hadn't ordered. She too never checked on us once.

Some of us had separate tabs but everyone had drinks flowing, I would say we spend at least $1,200 in the 3 hours that we were there.  We planned on staying here the whole night when out of no where a low budget bus boy comes and says we have to clear the space.. why? I don't know.  He literally came by and told we didn't have to leave the bar but the spot needed to be cleared off.  We tried talking to a guy who I was assuming was some sort of manager and he completely wrote us off, it was this bald short stumpy green eyed guy.

The quesadillas were much more taco like than quesadilla like. The pollo torta had some sort of ground beef or chorizo or something on it which wasn't mentioned on the menu at all and the churros were not stuffed as described and didn't come with a side of ice cream as mentioned on the menu. I know this place is new and they're still probably trying to work out the kinks but really the menus should be reprinted to represent the food. It's also pretty pricey for what you get.

    "text": "After about 6 Sunday football games they discontinued their Football program where each week if you go you get free things, leading up to a Free Happy Hour with up to 20 friends.  3 of us were dedicated and going every Sunday dropping $50 to $100 bux each time, while suffering through HORRIBLE service, dirty conditions, a management that could give a shit less.  They obviously are focused on the night life crowds and not the daytime.  They old us on either the 6th or 7th visit when we whipped our cards out  and it was time for a free T-Shirt the bartender said \"we quit doing those\" and then the manager came over.  He promised that he would figure out something for us since we were loyal customer for the past weeks, he did pick up our drinks (1 each) and if I didn't have anywhere to be later that day I would have sat and drank all day on his tab.  None of us have ever heard back from anyone at El Hefe, let alone from JUSTIN (the manager) who promised us he would get back to us.  I will NEVER EVER step foot in this bar again.  Save yourself time and walk down to Majerie's, you won't regret it.",

    "text": "DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: Worst food ever! Terrible service. From the minute my family and I walked in the door we were overcome what could only be described as an overwhelming scent of perfume. It seemed to permeate through the whole place. Kind of like walking through the fragrance section of Dillards. We had a Groupon, so that was the only reason we stayed to try it out. It took me a while to figure out what I thought about the decor. Finally when leaving I came to the conclusion that the word I was looking for was Tacky. It seemed like everything seemed to collide with each other. The walls, the booths, the music (did not seem to fit the place, and way too loud). The waitress took our order, and seemed to disappear. Never came back to see if we needed any more water until just about the end of our stay. Our food took forever to come out . People who were seated after us got their food, and we still had none, and no explanation as to what the hold up was. Another waitress even came to our table to see if she had been helped. When the food finally did come, the queso was tasteless and chewy. The Hefe Burger, I would say hands down was the worst burger I have ever tasted. Made McDonald's taste like gourmet. Had the consistency of Alpo. No kidding! My kids hated all the food here, and they are not picky eaters. We even left our left over burger behind. The Cobb salad we ordered was disgusting. 4 out of 4 family members thought the combination of goat cheese, boiled eggs, candied pecans, and pinto beans clashed with the sweet dressing. It was like the chef was trying too hard to be creative. Did not finish this either. Tried the pollo torta, and the carne asada tortas. Small and sub par. Nothing to brag about for the price. Resist the urge to try this place.",

    "text": "Went here to use a local dines coupon, otherwise I don't think we would have ever gone here. Greeted by a friendly person, who sat us in a booth (first lead us to a table and I saw the taps at the booths and wanted to try that!!).  Small place with everything opened up to the patio, the weather was perfect. Very good service from our waitress, with a good explanation of the taps, happy hour, and menu.  Speaking of the menu, it is a short menu that is somewhat hard to read.  We could tell we were going to be hard pressed to spend the $30 worth of coupon we had!!   I ordered a salad (very large) and mushroom taco (very small).  It all filled me up and tasted great.  Hubby ordered chicken torte aka sandwich which was good and spicy enough. This is definitely a hip place for young folks!  We were there early but were warned they expected a huge crowd (Thanksgiving Eve) later on.   We enjoyed pouring our own beers (happy hour prices are very good!), however when the bill came, our waitress had failed to charge us for the beers!  We had to get her attention again and have her ring up the proper amount (which turned out be under $2 a beer!)  Of course using a coupon we tipped according to the full price, and we were very satisfied with the service. The biggest drawback for me was..............smoking is allowed out on the patio and the place is small, so we had to smell this during our meal and I am allergic to smoke!!  Plus the music was very loud and we couldn't converse much.   However it was a fun experience and different.  We left still feeling like we didn't get our Mexican food fix.",

I read some people comparing it to Dia De Los Muertos; somewhat a stretch, but it was cool nonetheless. The coolest feature I found was the beer tap on some of the tables, which gives me an idea of where to take my friends for a night of drunken debauchery. Anyways, I didn't get to eat that time since I already had dinner waiting for me at home,  but the tacos look like the ones I've had in Mexico and the guacamole looked like it is really supposed to look like. I decided to skip the beer tap and ordered a \"Corona Familiar\" , which is a 40 oz  bottle of Corona that until recently it was only sold in Mexico. Anyways, my grand total for my big ass beer bottle; paper bag and all, was $5.00. I will say that I will like to come back for HH, only this time I will make sure to order some duck tacos... Salud!",

The chips and salsa are some of the best I've had. The first time we went, the hubs and I tried a bit of everything: nearly every taco and a torta. The most recent visit, we grabbed a taco and split a pork belly torta. If it's a first time, you gotta try the pork belly empanadas and chicken tinga. The table taps are really cool and, if I hadn't had my 3 mo old son with me, I would have had a beer. The only downside were the churros. The sauces were great and would have complimented the churros perfectly had the churros been cooked all the way through. I think the oil was too hot and crisped up the outside before the center was cooked. Even at that, definitely will return. Can't wait to try some nachos.",

    "text": "If you're coming straight from a pool party at the W, already wasted, and looking for a packed Sunday Funday, El Hefe is the place to go. That being said, it seems like business is already being lost with the openings of newer nearby clubs like Hifi and Maya. Have been here for lunch, happy hour, and many times for Sunday Funday and tables on weekends. The service is terrible no matter what time you go. Last time I was there the bartender poured my drinks, about 15 minutes after I ordered them, then set them on the bar where they were immediatly knocked over by a drunk patron. I was told that I still had to pay the over $30 tab and wouldn't get any replacement drinks. I understand that the bartenders might get overwhelmed when it's packed, but the service is just as bad during lunch when its practically empty. Our server looked annoyed, probably because she had to work a lunch shift instead of a busy night shift. My friend and I were literally the only people there besides a lone guy drinking at the bar, but she still took over 20 minutes to get our drink orders. Food was just OK. I prefer the tacos at pretty much every other similar Mexican restaurant in Old Town. I doubt I would ever come back for more than guacamole, chips, and drinks in terms of food. The beergarita drink (huge marg with a mini corona in it) is great. Expensive but definitley worth it. In terms of bottle service, their concept of offering a keg with a tap at the table is unique, and every guy I've ever been there with loves it. Service again was awful, despite our group spending on 2 bottles, a keg, and multiple shots. The server drank from our tap and constantly was jumping up on our table, literally pushing the girls in our group out of the way, so she could dance and blow her annoying whistle in our faces. We still had a great time, the music and overall atmosphere is great if you're looking to party, but for paying that much money I would expect to be served by my server, not treated like this was her table and we were just the bottle rats infringing on it. I definitley would not recommend to anyone who is not into/used to the Scottsdale club scene. If you're looking for a bar you can talk to your friends in, easily move around, etc (which we weren't, we came for the party scene), then Hefe is not your spot. But for striclty a drunken good time, would recommend. I just probably wouldn't waste money on the bottle service. Take your business elsewhere for that",

The music was so loud, we could hardly hear each other.  Typically a restaurant/bar doesn't bump up the music to that level until after 9 when more drinkers arrive.  We decided to try the Mexican Mule (being huge fans of the Moscow Mule).  We ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer.  I ordered the quesadilla for my meal and my roommate selected two carnitas tacos.  Our drinks arrived and the ginger beer in them was completely flat.  They were basically watered down tequila.  Undrinkable.  We asked if we could swap them out for something else.  The waitress complied.  As we waited for our replacement drinks, our main entrees came out.  Within 5 minutes, our chips and salsa arrived.  Another 10 minutes passed and finally our drinks arrived.  The delivery of the meal was a little backwards, but we were hungry.  The tacos were reported as \"really good.\"  My quesadilla consisted of three mini corn tortillas stuffed with some chicken and cheese and folded in half.  Not what I was expecting, but they were OK.  Someone described it as the new Pink Taco.  I would say it's a cross between Pink Taco and American Junkie.  Will definitely return for some afternoon day drinking.",

Granted, I don't like many meats, but no normal chicken or chopped carne asada varieties in sight. They still have the free guac and chips check-in which is worth 8 bucks. I added two rather basic ground beef tacos for $2 each (normally $4) and they were fine, just not memorable. The beer prices for happy Hour are great though as 3 bucks will get a domestic draft.",

I stopped in a few before coming here - Bottled Blonde and Hi Fi were alright. Unlike the others, there was a line here, and honestly I'm not sure why so many people feel the need to cram themselves into this abrasive venue.   My main complaint has to do with the sound levels. Although I was only there for ~15 min, my ears were ringing painfully when I left, and an hour or so later that developed into muffled/distorted hearing. Twelve hours later the next day, the tinnitus is still very present, and this is just from 15 minutes inside. It's beyond me how some people can frequent this venue every weekend or stand around with their drinks right in front of the massive tower speakers. The tinnitus will fade eventually, but I don't doubt I earned some irreversible nerve fiber damage. And I hope the lingerie-wearing bartender/stripper hybrids (apparently a thing in oldtown, just a side note because I think it's the most classic oldtown Scottsdale thing ever) at least have some hearing protection going on because they won't be hearing anything in a year otherwise.   I understand this is a nightclub, and aggressively loud music is par for the course. But this venue specifically went way overboard, and I'm certain they did no technical sound level testing during setup, such as at the maximum point when the sound waves from the speakers intersect basically right in front of the bar. I wouldn't be surprised if it was 150 dB there, when 85 is all you need for permanent damage.",

It came out of nowhere and we hadn't even paid our checks. We did really like our waitress but the kitchen took FOREVER to get us food. We eventually left and they tracked us down 2 hours later and invited us back in just to tell us there wasn't room for us. Would never return. Worst bar in that area we had a lot more fun at the other bars.",

We walked over for a drink and immediately upon walking in the whole bar smelled like dirty mop water. Not very appealing but we decided to stay for a shot. The glasses were all dirty and smelled like the bar itself. Safe to say we quickly made our way out of there and back across the street.",

Before the bartender had finished pouring the incorrect liqour, my friend corrected her, and she was met with a spiteful gaze and no response. The bartender just made her drink and ignored us.  The floors were absolutely filthy, trash and food was everywhere. I have never been treated as poorly as at el Hefe Scottsdale.

I'm not impressed with this place and there are plenty of other bars to go to where you at least get a friendly response. I'm just annoyed and the drink I ended up getting was awful. I won't be going back, the music and the scene wasn't fun.   In addition to that, they had some space theme with items from party city with blow up spaceships and cheap streamers. The people looking at this review won't even care. But I had to write it since I have a few minutes to waste on this review.",

Al Pastor Taco $3.00 - The red sauce on the al pastor taco has a sweet taste to it which was unique in my opinion.

We usually get 1 bottle of grey goose and then just order drinks and shots from our server (spending just as much as a bottle).    Server was pouring EXTRA drinks without putting mixer in them and leaving them on the side of the table. Then I noticed her take one of them away as if it was an empty.   Our server was also pouring very heavy, I don't usually mind and understand the server wants the bottle to finish quicker so we buy more.   Once the bottle ran out the server told us we needed to buy another one. We said we would rather just run up a tab and buy shots, mixed drinks, etc etc.  (there was 8 of us and we would have easily ran up more money than a bottle in the same time frame of drinking a bottle).    THE SERVER TOLD US TO GET OFF THE TABLE SINCE WE ARE NOT BUYING ANOTHER BOTTLE....  This has never happened at Revolver, Smashbox, Firehouse, Axis, or American Junkie.. We said we would be running up an equal amount, she said the only way she would allow us to stay is if each of us racked up a $200 tab.   Cliffs: Server was constanting pouring extra drinks and leaving them around our table. Server booted us from table for not buying another bottle even though we were willing to run up higher $$ tab.",

    "text": "Went to El Hefe to watch the Stanley Cup game last night.  Overall had a good time.  The place is big, loud and as other reviewed mentioned if you are looking for booty and some booze, then El Hefe is your place.  When we first sat down we had unlimited attention from 3 different wait staff.  After they settled in to who had our table, things slowed.  Service and drink delivery times were slow!  We never even got our last drink order.   Food was  good.  Chips, salsa  guacamole, various tacos and fajitas were enjoyed by our group.  All had excellent flavor and good portion size.  The only real problem was with the slow service and the bill.  At the end of the night when the bill arrived, I double checked and 3 items were added to our bill that we did not have.  I think I surprised our waitress by even looking.  She immediately removed them from the bill without question and had a lame excuse, \"This must have been leftover from an unclosed lunch ticket\".  Really, in today's modern service system, 2 items on a lunch ticket would not be closed out at 8 pm?    Overall a fun place to go to people watch, hit on women, watch a game and east some good food.  Just be aware of your bill and don't be in a hurry for service.",

They seem to care more about their social lives than their guests. Went in for happy hour and the server didn't even know what the happy hour margarita was. Took forever to get a drink and when we wanted to order another drink she was no where to be found. She didn't come back around until 7:01 and we missed the \"cut off\" for another drink on happy hour but she didn't tell us. Also had to move from the booths to a table because there was a cockroach crawling around. We let the server know and she said she'd tell a manager then we saw them sit someone else at that same table 2 minutes later. I'll go somewhere else next time for $2 tacos and and $13 margarita for \"happy hour\"",

And...it was just....how do I put this nicely?  Just not the Midwest.  All the women with fake tans, fake boobs spilling out of tanks, faux sexy hipsters mixed Men wearing tight Ed Hardy's with overly gelled hair & possible steriod use?  Just not my thing.  And it wasn't just the crowd of people there.  I ordered two gin & tonics (same gin) and they tasted VASTLY different.  On top of that, there were the overly surly cocktailers who seemed to be pissed off that people were there drinking.    I mean, I get that you want to finish your side-work and get home, but when a bar is open (and it's not even midnight), you can't get pissed off at your customers for putting down a drink on a table in an open section.  My favorite part of the night?  Leaving.  Sorry Boss.",

Came to watch the Suns game and got a prime spot at the bar with no problem. It was Tuesday, so you know what that means..and if you don't, I'll give you a hint: Taco Tuesday. El Hefes TT specials were great--$2 tacos and $3 draft Dos Equis.   So there's the back story.. now for the food.  Their tacos were SO good. I mean, really, really good. If you go to Barrio Queen for this type of fare, stop. Don't go back there, you're getting ripped off. The tacos here were super flavorful, and they do not skimp on the meat. My new favorite taco spot!  Come here for tacos. And to make it even sweeter, come here on a Tuesday so you can get 'em for 2 bucks.",

    "text": "Met my husband there last night for dinner.  I arrived first around 6:40 and the place was basically empty.  Three people or so at the bar and two tables with two people.  I waited at my table for my husband to arrive for nearly 10 minutes.  No server came over.  Once my husband arrived the server walked by our table a few times before my husband asked if we had a waitress.  She took our order and while we waited for our food we watched the drunk people at the bar and one girl announcing that she was going to the bathroom to throw up.  When she returned, she and her \"date\" staggered out the door.  A new patron arrived and sat at the bar but left after 5 minutes with no service.  The other two tables cleared as well.  My Supermacho bowl arrived lukewarm with pinto beans instead of the black beans I ordered.  The sauteed fajita veggies were actually raw onion and diced peppers.  I would have asked for a manager but it did not appear that anyone in there cared.  We could not get out of there fast enough.  Unfortunately it took our server about 15 minutes to process our bill.",

It is the club that started a new fad in Old Town, inspiring other, newer clubs to be more like it with indoor/outdoor setups, plus the taps built into the tables is a cool concept. The servers there are friendly and the place is fun. So what's not to like? Well, I was completely underwhelmed with the food our table had ordered.  The burgers were dry and the portion size of the sides were very small. The prices were a little high as well.

    "text": "I will start off by saying that this review is influenced by two completely different experiences, which is represented by my middle of the road rating. (First visit: 4 star, Recent visit: 1 star)  To keep this relatively short I will just bullet point the things these two visits have taught me.   1. El Hefe is NOT a place to take a group. All the food ordered by a single table comes out together on the same blocks (yes I mean wooden blocks), with no sense of order. Now granted going with a group of 15 people (which I did), tends to lead to some confusion at any restaurant, but this was inexcusable. If you ordered the same thing as someone on the opposite side of the table from you it would come on the same platter and it was up to the customer to yell across the table, find what they had ordered, and have it passed over to them. This becomes particularly difficult with unfamiliar specialty tacos. Everything looks similar so only order something with a noticeable ingredient to guarantee correct delivery.   2. Having said that, this place does well with small groups, during the lunch time hours. Sit in one of the booths with the self serve beer taps at the table. It's definitely a unique and cool feature.   3. Check your bill! Every person in our group was overcharged for a particular drink that we specifically asked about the price. The same thing occurred with an up charge on a food menu item add on.   4. The decor is cool and unique, but be prepared for an Ed Hardy-esque explosion. Just embrace it.   5. The food is pretty delicious, but I am not a connoisseur.  Be prepared for small taco portions and tapas style entrees.   Overall this is a place for a quick happy hour drink and delicious $3 taco or a nice light lunch.  It's growing pains are providing a temporary excuse for some of it's short comings so be patient but provide feedback. It's needed.   P.S Don't forget to try the Bulldog Margarita (Margarita with a Corona in it)",

    "text": "At first my feelings for El Hefe were love/hate. Mainly because I couldn't understand why they built this place to be so freaking SMALL with such a MASSIVE bar... sort of a stupid design plan. Not even a dance floor was included when they built this place yet they managed to add TWO bars.  I would only go to Hefe when I was getting a table or if someone in the group knew a bartender. But after being dragged in all summer, I warmed up to it. It is still not my favorite but I do love the concept and the wall decor.   I would suggest if you plan on coming here on Friday or Saturday, get a table. The money is worth it unless you plan on spending half your night just trying to bob and weave through a sardine can filled with people.",

    "text": "The 2-star description is labeled as \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" That basically sums up El Hefe. Came here late this past Saturday night for my sister's 21st birthday. The line to get in was outrageously long, and we waited probably close to 30-40 minutes before we decided to just pay the bouncer to let us in... wasn't worth it.   The layout of El Hefe is basically this: everything is centered around the bar. The restaurant is pretty much in the shape of a rectangle, with the bar in the middle of it. On the outer layer is the private-VIP seats, and the space between the bar and the seats is your \"dance space\" (I'm not even going to call it a dance floor because it's way too small to be that). There's a DJ on one end of the restaurant, and there's a little bit more room to dance there, but it's just so crowded that you basically can't dance without being back to back or shoulder to shoulder with everyone around you. Even buying a drink is difficult. You'll get your area at the bar and try to order a drink, but the bartenders just go to whomever--not really noticing who's been standing there for longer or shorter periods of time.   I don't know my experience was a typical of El Hefe, or if it was just really busy this past Saturday, but one thing's for sure--I have definitely experienced better at other bars in Old Town Scottsdale.",

I went to the bar to get a drink and you would have thought that I was invisible. The bartender made eye contact with me at least six times and just flipped her head and went elsewhere.  When I did manage to get someones attention, I was told that they were out of Rose. I never got offered anything else.  I might come back when they are not busy and see if the flow and food are any better. If you are 21 to 28, this is probably your seen on party nights.  #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate",

    "text": "A group of 6 of us came in last night for my bachelorette party around 10pm. First we sat at a table, no one came, so we figured maybe we're supposed to order at the bar. I waited at the bar for a solid 5 minutes with no acknowledgement. Finally I asked someone walking by if we can order food at a table. He pointed to a different table and told us to sit there if we wanted service. So we moved. Then we waited another 15 minutes without even a single look from the staff. In retrospect I can't believe we waited that long, but we really wanted some carne asada fries. As a last ditch effort, I went back up to the bar to try to get someone's attention and we were blatantly ignored. I just don't get it-- I might understand if we came in acting obnoxious or something, but we were a really cournteous group, just wanted some food and drinks. I'm disappointed we wasted 25 minutes there. The place was nearly empty, and I assumed it was because it was early, but we went across the street and the other bars were pretty full. Now that I think about it, maybe people avoid this place because the service is the worst. I know I won't be coming back.  Edit: in response to the manager's comment, I am referring to Saturday night on 2/16, and I can assure you I do not have the restaurant confused with somewhere else. What a joke.",

Everything I've tried is fresh and delicious.  I love their ceviche tostadas, salsa, chips and guac to start, but we've also had the corn dip and it's pretty good.  The tacos are all yummy, and the house salad is really good.  I haven't tried anything I didn't like.  The servers are friendlier than I would expect and that's been consistent so they hire well.  Not sure I would've tried this place based purely on appearances and the bar atmosphere because it's not really our style, but the food keeps bringing us back.

We ordered a couple of drinks and people watched for an hour or so.  They serve a specialty Margarita here that's served in a large glass and a full Corona bottle turned upside down inside the glass, they call it a \"Beer-garita\".....it looks ridiculous.  Even more hilarious was the number of people who were walking around drinking this monstrosity....it reminds me of the tourists in Vegas who walk around with those giant tubes of Hurricanes or Margaritas....great people watching I tell ya!

We get our bill and I was charged for a regular priced margarita ($13 - who would ever pay that for a margarita first of all). So I go over to the waitress and explain the situation. She then tells me \"oh we don't really do happy hour.\" I tell her that I've come for happy hour many times AND there is a happy hour menu on our table. Then she tells me that they're not doing HH during the final four. So I ask to speak to a manager. After waiting 10 min for this manager to come over, the waitress comes over and said there's no manager present. After questioning there being no acting manager on site, she changes her story and says he's in the \"back.\" After changing her story a few more times, she says he's in the bathroom and I'd have to wait to get the charge reversed. Clearly trying to make the wait so long that I'll just pay the full bill...nope. After another 10 minutes, he finally comes over and blames the waitress for not notifying us that they're not doing happy hour, but does not apologize.   Giving them two stars because the food was good and the manager ended up reducing the price of my margarita. But will never give this location my business again.",

We ordered tacos and asked for hot sauce, so the waitress asked us if we wanted \"Pico De Gallo, Salsa Verde or Salsa roja\". So we said bring all three. When we got our bill she charges us a $1 each for the little salsa she brought out. If she informed us about charging us then we might as well got the chips and salsa for $3 that already comes with the 3 salsas.    Also, our tacos were cold by the time she brought them out and service was slow when we asked for our check. Not sure why it was slow because it was only my party of 4 and a couple that were the only ones in there other the the 4 other people at the bar, so we wrote a note why we only gave 10% tip.   However, we passed by again at night and it loooked poppin!! The nightlife here is probably the spot for this place because dining in during the day was not the business.",

    "text": "We came here while exploring Scottsdale to satiate a sudden urge for churros. And what a fun place!  The bar was super busy and we decided to get a drink while waiting for our churros, since it seemed like a fun place to hang out on a Sunday evening. I ordered the Margarita, it was plenty to keep me going for the rest of my stay at El Hefe and tasted delicious.   The Churros was simply delicious, came with three dipping sauces, Chocolate Ganache, Coconut and Dulche De Leche. The presentation was fantastic and it was the most memorable & delicious churros experience I've had in my life. The Horchata milk shake that came with the churros was delectable and addictive. I wonder why we didn't get a round two of the churros.",

We asked to speak to a manager and no one ever came except the server. I don't have a problem with gratuity included, however if you're going to add 20% to the bill I expect speedy service and a manager to come to our table when requested.",

My review will be similar to the one for Hi Fi because, well, they both sucked the same!   I went last Saturday night and this place was like a sardine can!! SUPER wayy too packed! There was NO room for dancing, or even just mingling. Frankly, you couldn't even breathe!! Brushing elbows? More like brushing noses! It was miserable and as soon as I felt my claustrophobia kicking in I needed to escape! We were about to leave when this guy started talking to me, lucky for me he did because we found a small 2 feet by 2 feet area we could a least attempt to dance in as they started to play some awesome salsa jams. Best 5 minutes of music we had heard all night so we bounced our little hearts out, all of the white guys in complete shock at seeing these two little Latin fire crackers break it down lol, annnnd then we left.   Seriously though, who wants to \"party\" like that?? I want to be able to mingle, get a drink fairly quick, DANCE and I don't know have room to breathe and chill out. I know places may be popular and \"thee place to be\", but it would seem way more exclusive and maybe even worth paying entry if the atmosphere was right.  Like really EL HEFE they have \"maximum occupancy\" laws for a reason! I could not imagine what would happen if a fire broke out! This place is not only NOT fun, but also NOT safe!   I don't see myself ever going back on a Sat night. The ONLY reason I gave them 2 stars and not 1 is because my friend and I didn't have to wait in their long ass line. We walked up to the front and they just let us in lol.",

That unfortunately, is exactly what has taken place in Old Town when R.H.G. opened El Hefe. While this seven figure restaurant and nightclub has been profiting off of the $73K Median Household Income in the city of Scottsdale, don't be surprised if you see the Owners getting wasted and starting fights in their own bar. (I have personally observed this take place)   El Hefe does consistantly produce good quality food service, and is one of the best Nightclubs in AZ. You can always count on R.H.G. having their DJ's perform the best mixes of EDM/Hip-hop. However, they recently renovated and reopened a smaller nightclub than before by removing a good 5-7 booths where they set up bottle service sales....This move makes no sense and only means less revenue. They still remain at having only one bar after the renovation. We can only wait and see if the Owners are going to screw up the Boss of Scottsdale.",

(Though in retrospect, her recommendation was probably due to her running into the same old man who liked to buy all her drinks every time... should have taken that into account).  Strike 1: So loud I can't hear myself. Literally engaging my diaphragm and voice projection training just to make myself heard to my friends and the waitresess.  Strike 2: The tacos are not that great. They have duck, which is the only really saving grace about them, but they're like $5 for this little tiny,1/4 of a tortilla sized taco. They tasted pretty boring to me.  Strike 3: I had to hunt down my waitress. I mean, I walked around for 10 minutes looking for her to cash out, and this place is SMALL. I was very tempted to walk out on the tab just due to the crappy service..  Strike 4: We got water dumped on us due to the awnings outside. The manager sent us a round of shots, and he wasn't fooling anybody, they were pure grapefruit juice. Gee, thanks for filling my Vitamin C requirement...?  Oh snap, 4 strikes and you are definitely out of the park for good, El Hefe.",

They were having no luck getting through, and neither was I. This was the clubs fault for letting too many people in. But instead of waiting or gentle nudging through the security guard shoved my friends and I, spilling all of our paid beverages all over us. My drink also spilt on them, which gave the trashy bartender the idea to reach down and PULL MY HAIR. I was then dragged out by security being yelled at for throwing drinks. I was completely appalled. I live in Las Vegas and deal with lots of bullshit at bars and clubs but never have been physically attacked by employees, especially when I was trying to leave the bar. This place does not have their shit together and the employees are violent and do not give a single shit about their paying customers.",

Our waters were never empty, we got extra chips for our queso when we were low, and our drinks were delicious!   I ordered their cucumber/jalapeno margarita and it was so yummy! The perfect amount of kick. I tried my husband's house margarita as well and it was DELISH for a \"house\"! Typically they're too sour for me but this was perfectly balanced - so I ended up getting one for my second drink.  We also indulged in tacos. I loved the beef taco! It was only $2 on happy hour, yes please! My husband tried their beef, shrimp, and fried avocado tacos and loved them all.   We will absolutely be back another time! It would be a great place to watch football in the Fall because they have loads of TVs and great sound! It is nice visiting the Scottsdale \"row\" when there aren't crazy lines everywhere and it isn't busy. I guess this might mean that i'm \"old\" now? :)",

Um, since when does ANY bar have a dress code against men in tank tops? One of the most insane backwards things I've ever heard of at a club. Ladies walking inside wearing next to nothing (as they can and should be able to do) and I got turned away for a normal shirt.   As always, the bouncers just had the best customer service and were so helpful and friendly about it all. Wait a second... nope.

Everything was delightful and delicious and even though this was a comped experience the staff was very kind and attentive. I will definitely visit this spot in the future because it was just that damn fun!",

Although it wasn't as crowded as it usually is (I'm assuming because it was Sunday) my friend and I had such a great time hanging out here. The food was amazing. I wanted to order everything off the menu. The drinks were great too. You definitely get your money's worth! And the customer service was superb. I wish I remember the servers name but she was a sweet blonde bartender who made it so easy to talk to and suggested awesome choices for us off the menu. She even stopped in the middle of her busy shift to snap a photo of my friend and I. I highly suggest this place if you're looking for a lively atmosphere with great music and great food!",

I was literally the ONLY person sitting at the bar and have been ignored for the majority of the time. I arrived around 7p on a Wednesday so the place was not very busy at all. I've waited 10 minutes to get another drink. There are 4 other servers at the end of the bar that have noticed I'm done with food and drink (I overheard them talking) yet not a single one of them has come up to me to ask if I need anything. The bartender is nowhere in sight.   I'm the GM of a hotel and never write negative reviews because I know how they can impact business. With that said, I have to write this in hopes that management trains their staff to respond to cues and avoid ignoring customers/guests.   Overall, the food was good, hence the 2 stars, but the service is horrible. Quite honestly, the servers are here to be eye candy and not for their ability to provide good service.",

And I don't mean with just people in general.  I mean sweaty, overly intoxicated, overly \"friendly\" d's.    You have to expect that going into a place where you'll wait in line for 45min if you don't have breasts, right?  But again....the confetti.   They have chicks that dance on the bar running around with a whistle and a bottle of liquor pouring shots into whomever is brave enough to step up to the bar.  (This girl on her birthday! - no judgement needed.)  Note to self: this liquid they pour into your mouth taste more like battery acid rather than actual alcohol, but hey, it's the experience.  I have never even considered eating here being that I only force my friends into this establishment for special occasions.....or nights we've been over poured and feel like Superman.    On my birthday we ventured in here for 30min-1hr.  Enough time for a drink or two and a couple confetti showers. Heaven.  If you haven't been I recommend at least going once to really experience a real \"unce unce\" night in Old Town.  It will be everything you imagined.  That is if you imagine things such as: sticky floors, tight shirts on men, girls with tube socks on bars, overly gel'd - spiked hair, tight/short dresses, long lines (outside and inside), ear drum bursting bass and CONFETTI.   You're welcome.",

    "text": "Visited AZ for the first time from CA earlier this month, my cousin recommended El Hefe for taco Tuesday so we went. When we first approached the security outside, I was confused because he asked for my I.d. I asked him why do I have to show I.d to get into a restaurant? He told me it was the rule and this place was a bar so I brushed it off. The guy was a buff white guy with a long beard and I assumed he was going to give us trouble. However, I told him we were visiting and he was just sweet as pie. He was so cool and down to earth and I felt bad that I passed judgment before conversing with him. They had a DJ with a dope sound and lighting system and it was the perfect atmosphere for a Tuesday. I ordered chicken tacos and I thought they were gross, I didn't like the food too much but after a few margaritas I was all in. We then realized that this place was turning into a club after the kitchen was closed. We weren't dressed for the occasion but we stayed. We began to sit on top of the booths after eating like everyone else who came in to party. After sitting up there for about 45 minutes another even bigger guard with a long beard and buff frame approached us and told us that the booth we were sitting on was reserved. He pleasantly asked us to get down and I could tell he didn't want to really tell us. I assumed the worst of this place when we approached because of the tales I've heard but this place goes up on a Tuesday and we had a ball. The bar tender knew it was my girl's bday so she hooked us up with shots and I tipped her all night. I'm sad to read other reviews about racist bad service because that wasn't our experience. I would go back in a heartbeat! Thank you to staff at El Heffe for treating us like we were guest, y'all made our experience so much more. To the two guards that night, thanks for being so freakin cool and down to earth! Not really down with the swirl but they were cute too lol! Thanks guys!",

The bartenders responded \"You pay for all four or none.\" So he paid for all 4 drinks. A larger woman had accidentally bumped into him and he had accidentally spilt a little of his drink on her. She slapped him so hard and then he had dropped all four drinks on her from being slapped so hard. The bouncer immediately grabbed him by the neck and pushed him out the door.

Then bless your heart and we should be BFF).  I mean I'm pretty much here at LEAST once a week. Most likely 2-3 times. Mostly to rage face on the weekends. Sunday Funday? DUH. I'm usually pretty hamskied by the time I walk over here but I'm pretty sure you can find me dancing somewhere around the bar.   I can say that now have actually eaten the food here and it's def better than I thought it was gonna be. I've had brunch here before...they don't do bottomless but they do like a $15 schooner and then penny refills. Not mad at it. I can't remember what I had for brunch but I'm pretty sure I didn't eat it bc I was hung over and about to vom. But I think the bite or two that I did have were pretty tasty. The tacos are pretty good too - I've had the steak, chicken and beef cheek. Beef cheek is probs my fav. Get it. Don't be a puss.   Hefe is in my little hot corner and I do love me some of that hot corner - it's always packed! but I think with Bottled Blonde opening up, there's been a little more breathing room.   Hefe..hefe..hefe..**sigh** so many blurred memories. All of which I'm sure were a great time.",

But from the entrance, we could see several men with white shirts on. When asked about it, we were told we needed to pay $800 for a table to be allowed in like them. Being me, I went to the side of the bar and asked a random man in a white shirt standing on the side if he had paid $800 for a table.... He laughed and asked what I was talking about. And then I had a security guard (from that same bar) tell me that what I thought I saw was correct and he saw it every night, but he didn't own the place so there was nothing he could do...  This is not a place I would want to spend my money anyways. Just felt the need to share because I believe of you don't, your just part of the problem.",

    "text": "Disappointed with this visit. I had dinner here one year ago and it was truly amazing so much so that I went out of my way to eat at the one in Chicago and then came back this trip to Scottsdale and brought some friends. I had been telling them for weeks the margaritas were one of the best I had ever had and they had to try one. Unfortunately, timing did not work out for us to eat but we decided to grab some of those delicious margarita that I had been thinking about for a year. To my dismay the bartender was in a rush and did not measure very accurately making them too tart to the point that they were almost undrinkable.  We decided we would just finish our drinks and then head to another establishment in the area. Prior to leaving I stopped by the restroom which was in deplorable condition! Two of the three toilets were not functioning, stall doors did not lock and the overall cleanliness was disgusting. The unsanitary conditions solidified the poor experience for this visit. I don't think this location will be on the \"must visit\" list next spring.",

The club/bar layout is open and spacious, giving you an alternative option to the cramped styles of the traditional lunch spots. The tacos are phenomenal, I highly recommend the al pastor or duck carnitas, for great savory options. And the positive, aesthetically pleasing staff kept the experience light and full of good vibes. An all around good experience.",

As you are well aware, there is never a shortage of notes from customers that wish to complain and often the compliments come few and far between. I would like to change that, today. I attended Cinco de Mayo at your establishment and had the most fun I have ever had in my life. You put on one heck of a show. From the \"girls\" that danced on the bar all night, to the \"girls\" that paraded around in bathing suits, it was impressive. Although I only ate one taco, I stared at a buffet of tacos all around me. And they were good. The DJ and the continuous ummmph ummmph from the bass provided the perfect rhythm for girls with daddy issues to rub up on strangers. Like I said earlier, you did well. Real well. The memories of easily manipulated coeds swarming your bar like a couple of retards fighting over the last two pieces of cake will not be easily erased. I can only hope that your Memorial Day party is just as sleazy and creepy!  Keep up the great work. Long live El Hefe.   - (the first tapper booth on left)",

If there was an option for 3.5 stars, I'd do that instead.",

We sat at the bar and had the Pork Belly Torta and Carnitas Tacos. The food was tasty and even impressed my boyfriend the chef.   I'd go back again but avoid ordering anything off their drink menu without finding out the ingredients--who knew that Four Loko is a flavored, colored alcoholic soda-like beverage that tastes like otterpops with cheap vodka? And who would want that in their margarita?   Maybe it's a sign of the times; I'm getting old not keeping up with what's what in the world of flavored liquors. Our server was nice to comp the drink that I wasn't a fan of -- this is always a good move in the service industry. Kudos on good customer service to El Hefe.",

I'm pretty sure I saw someone slipping something in to someone's drink and I warned her, so luckily she didn't drink it. Basically, the only reason I am giving it two stars is because if I had to choose between this place and whiskey row I would choose here - but only if my husband was with me.",

Now my first experience was somewhat awful. It was late on a Saturday night and the place was packed like sardines. If you thought you were going to take a step to the patio for some fresh air, think again. You'd be lucky if you made it out there or found room to stand. I think I learned that night, you just can't bring a big crowd to this location on a 'busy' Scottsdale evening.   Second experience was Happy Hour! I believe it's from 4-7 and they have a great happy hour menu for both men and women. I'm a bit partial to their Beer-goritas. , which is a 32 oz margarita and a coronita upside down in it! I love it, I think presentation sucked me in. Yea I'm a sucker.  The tables with the taps on them seem pretty sweet, and made me think about possibly holding my bday party there but the seating is limited and the booths just arent that big.   They have a lot of creative and unique margaritas to choose from and I definitely plan on making a few visits back but debateable on if this is a good birthday setting or not...",

    "text": "With plans to go to Spring Training in full effect, I turned to Living Social and Groupon to find some deals on places to eat nearby and El Hefe was at the top of my list. I went to their site (and Yelp) page and instantly purchased the Groupon voucher. $20 for $40 worth of food and drinks. Unbeknownst to me there are tons and tons of Mexican restaurants in the Scottsdale area and El Hefe was in the middle of a very nice neighborhood full of eateries trying to cash in on Spring Training.   As you approach El Hefe you'll notice their great outdoor patio, perfect for brunch, day drinking, or a refreshing cocktail as the sun sets. We arrived a little before noon on a Saturday, which meant they were offering their brunch drinks. Even before we got inside the trendy taqueria, our eyes gravitated towards an oversized mimosa with a mini champagne bottle coming out of the goblet. After seating ourselves and our attractive waitress introducing herself, I ordered the Bulldog Mimosa for $12 with refills at $0.01!  After milling over the menu for a bit, as well as enjoying my oversized mimosa simultaneously, I ordered the Pollo Parrilla Torta, a Mexican sandwich with grilled chicken breast with a tomato-ancho jam, chipotle mayo, queso asadero, mixed greens, and a bit of lime oil. My party ordered a few high-calorie appetizers that I passed on, in order to enjoy a few of the penny refills. Priorities first.  A few refills later (3 or 4 to be exact) our food came out and the fajitas looked great as did the two tortas we ordered. The bread of the torta was fluffy and sweet and was a striking contrast to what I'm used to but added great dimension to the sandwich. The chicken was equally great and had plenty of flavor all while being moist. All the flavors worked together making it a truly unique Mexican sandwich. I added a bit of hot sauce and the torta was gone before I knew it. I went ahead and tried the steak fajitas ($16) which instantly made me want to order the steak torta. I didn't. I should mention that additional tortillas are $2.  I should mention that the mimosa refills aren't the big, overflowing, jumbo-sized ones but rather the size of a normal cocktail. Nevertheless you can't complain for a penny. The bar staff messed up a few times and I was lucky enough to get varying sizes of the mimosa refills. Service was inconsistent but you couldn't be mad at our friendly waitress, as she was overworked and was servicing every table. You'd think they'd have a full staff ready to go given that it's a Saturday, at 12pm, on gameday.   El Hefe was close to a perfect 5 stars but after some churros that were sent back and a less than helpful manager, as well as the inconsistent service, 4 stars will have to suffice. I will, however, be back next year during Spring Training, especially to try out their tableside beer taps that I didn't have a chance to try out this time around.   Ambiance/Decor: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Price: $$ Overall: 4/5  Pros: + Unique taqueria decor (very San Diego) + Patio bar/seating + Large main bar + Spacious dining area/tables + Tableside beer taps! + Oversized drinks w/ refill specials + Tasty tortas and great overall menu + Attractive waitresses and bartenders  Cons: - Additional tortillas run $2 - Inconsistent service - Manager did little to resolve our problem",

Each taco is tender and juicy without skimping on the serving of protein. The carne asada are my favorite out of the list.   On a night on, this place can get busy. Lots of guys largely due to the good music, attractive staff dancing on counters and overall nightlife appeal. The service and waiting for a drink is really good. The bartenders in general are attentive.  Good for tacos and good for nightlife. Pick what works for you.",

My friend and I went to the bathroom early in the night and my friend realized she had gum all over the back of her dress. Another girl in the bathroom suggested we try hair spray. I saw a bottle on the counter and grabbed it to spray on my friend's dress. The bathroom attendant yanked it out of my hand and asked if I had tip money. I told her I unfortunately didn't have cash, but needed to try to get this gum off of my friend's dress. She capped the bottle and told us we couldn't touch it if we didn't have a tip. That's not working for a tip bitch, that's charging people. I have never in my life heard of a bathroom attendant charging people to use things, whether they bring it in or not. I spoke to the guy took care of our reservation, but he didn't seem to care. Great customer service.",

At $11 it offered great value for a choice of 3 impressive sounding tacos and 1 side (Street corn for me).   While not a huge deal, a few bumps in the service lead me to drop the 4th star and give a 3. A mix up of 2 taco orders occurred (but was rectified in a timely manner). It wasn't until I began eating my tacos that I realized that mine was mixed up too (I should have caught it earlier, nevertheless, all the tacos were great).   Considering the simplicity of what we ordered I thought it would have been nice if the server just automatically split our bill. Whatever...she didn't, but when the bill came all 4 taco especials came up as $12. I know $4 isn't much to complain about...but it says $11 on the menu. I mentioned it to the server and (in a friendly manner) she returned with a new bill. But all she did was give a discount to rectify the discrepancy...but the discount was only for $3...still charging that extra $1 for the 4th meal. Again...the money is not the issue, just the principle.  Other than that...a great place to grab some food!",

    "text": "Do NOT go here for food. We went here last Thursday around 7pm and it was completely dead, still the waitress walked by us numerous times without ever asking if we wanted water, drinks or food. After 30 minutes we just walked to the bar and ordered our drinks and food there. The waitress NEVER once stopped at our table to \"check on us\" and she spent a lot of the time in the back and was nowhere in site along with the bartender (we only saw two girls working). Around 8pm my friend arrived and she had to ALSO go to the bar to order her food or drinks or flag down the waitress to order something. There were only 2 other tables in the restaurant so its not like she was super busy, she didnt even acknowledge us or apologize for not coming to the table. We felt completely ignored the entire time and she would snicker at us when we would try to get her attention and she ignored us (group of 6). we were wanting to keep drinking all night but closed our tab and left to another bar where our service and tip money was appreciated. I NEVER tip $0 but i had to for this case, we tipped the bartender on the drinks we ordered but that waitress didnt deserve even $1 which i have never done. Even on bad service I usually leave 15%, but NO SERVICE i left $0. Do not go here if you want to get ignored.",

It costed $12.25, seeing that it's a nightclub that's pretty reasonable so I didn't care. When the scantily clad bar tender came back I ordered my second rum and coke, no beer this time, the check came back as $12.25... why?? I was definitely not drunk enough for the bartender to try and play that trick on me. At this point it was like 10pm and the bar started poppin so I wasn't too mad. Then some Mexican bro started grabbing up on me thinking I was the girl he was hitting on, problem is I'm a dude and he was grabbing my stomach. Once I got his hand off my abbs and moved to a different location, found some girls, and had a kick ass time. So all together if you wanna have your wallet drained for a 90% coke 10% rum drink then go right ahead. But avoid the drunk weirdos and find yourself some babes",

An employee not taking our order grabs the card, he's not helping is at all or even knows what we want and my friend says hey, what's up? And the guy helping us finally says HE WORKS HERE. Ok... but why is he taking our card? It's just shady and nasty and they herd you like cattle. It's ridiculous. We had one round and went across the street. Way better. Better music, better drinks. I can still fee his grip on my arm. It's excessive. I'm not one of the other drunkasses barfing outside. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Literally anywhere else would be better. They should really just  erbally tell people what to do instead of grabbing them. What the hell. NEVER happened before and I go to way better clubs in the San Diego gaslamp. Like do not touch me.

I know people complain about the front men at Maya, but at least they do their job professionally. Also, at Mint, they're very professional as well.   Once inside, it's pretty messy, the crowd and patrons there aren't the ideal crowd you want to be around, neither at the El Hefe on Mill, it must be an El Hefe thing. :P An obnoxious, and irresponsible atmosphere.

From the other reviews I thought my visit would have been better but there were a couple of issues that I found very annoying.  Pros:   The bartender who made my mojito was on point - she was smiling, provided quick service, and the drink was good.  Cons:   The layout of this place makes it difficult to socialize.  The aisles are narrow, the bar takes up too much room and it just feels small and crowded.  If you try to talk to someone sitting at a booth inside, all you will hear is \"excuse me\" every 3 seconds because there's no room to get past the tables. There also is a rude person who walks around making people get up from their bar stools and stand so they can take the chairs.  I had just ordered a drink and sat down at the bar when I was told I needed to get up.  Strangely, the people next to me at the bar eating were NOT told to get up.  Not cool. WTF is with hiding the bathroom door??  Do you think I want to look like an idiot staring at a wall and NOT seeing the door?  Douchebaggery at work.  If I decide to go back (and that's a big if) I will try some of the food and update this review.  Let's just say I'm in no hurry to return though.",

    "text": "Protip: Add the Fried Egg to the Torta.  After visiting El Hefe in both the Scottsdale and Chicago locations I must say that this is one of my favorite places to get a modern spin on delicious Mexican food and watch a game, party or attend Happy Hour. The vibe and energy of the bar can't be denied.  If you're looking for a nice quiet night out then this is surely not going to be the venue for you. But if you want to have fun, get a great Beer-Garita (all time amazing) and some high quality Mexican food this is the place. I didn't even know Duck Carnitas were possible until coming here and they did not disappoint one bit. It's hard to pick a favorite taco because they are all enjoyable.   Whenever I can visit Scottsdale or Chicago, El Hefe is a must stop to watch a Bears or Blackhawks game. I'd argue it's almost as fun as actually attending the games themselves!",

I should stress my main experience here is only on a Friday or Saturday night.  Its always packed in here, and hot as can be.  Hard to move let alone dance.  Often tough to get to the bar and order a drink because there are so many people posted up there.  Not my favorite place, there are generally fun good looking people but at the price of standing like cattle.  Drinks are decent and well priced, but I only go here if I have to.  Just far too crowded for me, too hard to order drinks, hard to dance.  No where to sit down really at night.  I believe there is good seating in the day, but they move all the tables and chairs to make space for more people.",

The girls in the bar are there spotting the potential big tippers, I don't blame them but please.... I spent a good while with my card in my hand waiting for my order to be taken while the girls were attending all the boys around me... Fed up, I turned to my husband and told him to try to order himself. He took my place in the bar and within maybe 2 min he was back with drinks for everybody!!!! Shameful!!! But the worst part was at the end... we ordered our drinks and without previous notice from the bar, once we got served and payed of course, this bouncer arrived with the worst manners ever, shouting to us to get out of there. We were really shocked since we were just two couples, quite calm compared with the rest of the audience, not really trouble makers... We told him that if they were not going to let us finish the drinks they shouldn't have sold them to us, right?  Well the bouncer started shouting even more at us and being incredibly rude, we left the place before things would go worse... Horrible experience, never again!",

    "text": "if you want douches and crap service then El Hefe is your spot. Two years ago this was a rotation nightout spot for friends and I, so, I never had the chance to try out the place during early evening hours for food and drink. Fast forward to recently, seeing that Hi-Fi Kitchen across the street was ridic crowded compared to not as busy El Hefe, a friend and I decided to stop by for a drink and a snack. Upon entering we were told by one of the server/hostess girls to pick a table or sit at the bar. We both wanted to sit outside but saw all their high tops were taken and reluctantly sat at the bar. After a few mins, while waiting to order drinks, a table emptied out, and we snatched it up and this is where they get a one star.   Personally they do a good job as a bar in old town during the weekends, they play okayish dance music, it's loud, it's happening, it's relevant. They have the douches out to play and they keep the nighttime masses liquored up BUT that's it. Service wise they fail miserably. As we sat at our table, we waited, and waited, and waited so more. There was a server who went by us to attempt to clean up (attempt because she didn't do much) another vacated table, she passed us yet again to check on another table, and passed us yet again just walking by. She could clearly see that we were sitting there with two menus, looking at it, and now bored looking at our phones, and not ONCE did she take the courtesy to stop by and offer a drink order or water. NOTHING. Let me add, it's a bit disconcerting as a customer when you hear the bar staff express concern that Hi-Fi seems really busy across the street while they talk about their lack of business on their side. With servers that do not provide service I can see why you ought to be worried.   I'm a patient person, and I give props to good service where due but our last straw occurred when a group of girls (six in all) showed up, walked in a grabbed a table behind us on the patio, and lo behold, the SAME SERVER, walks up and assists them, hands out menus, and turns around and ignores us yet again. WTF?!? We got up, we walked out. I saw the manager and felt the need to express my disgust at what I witnessed, maybe I didn't express myself clearly but he didn't seem to care much either. We walked out.",

My friend ordered the chips and salsa which I know isn't really anything super special but the pico de gallo was very good as well, just in case you were wondering.  If you're going to come on a weekend night it does get pretty crowded so I wouldn't recommend coming if you're claustrophobic but it's a fun atmosphere where you can meet a lot of interesting people and get some good drinks and tacos!",

It was pretty packed and we had to wait outside for like 10 minutes before they let us in but it was worth it.  The first thing we noticed when we walked in was Steve Nash chilling with some guys. I wouldn't have expected him at a place like this but it was really cool. They also had Mr. T upstairs dancing with a bunch of women.  Drinks are cheap. We got a couple mixed drinks and a couple beers for $14. Bartenders are cute and friendly from what I saw.  They had two girls up on the bar with a beer bong and I thought that was awesome. I didn't participate, but it was fun watching other people do it.  We got there kind of late, so it ended up clearing out a little bit and we were able to get our grove on. The whole vibe of the place was just really cool. I ended up having a blast here and I'm definitely planning on going back next weekend!",

    "text": "El Hefe - Macho Taqueria. Man...  At first glance it looks like every stereotype you've ever heard about Scottsdale. At second glance you realize that it is, indeed, every stereotype you've heard about Scottsdale. It's a \"Mexican Restaurant\", so when I was there I tried a few of their tacos that were on happy hour. I'm giving two stars because the duck taco that I had was pretty good, but once the food got to the table it took me 4 minutes to figure out which tacos were mine because of the way they present the food. More on this later.   El Hefe has a cool in-table tap system, where you pay at the table and can pour your own beer. When I saw this I liked it a lot, though they only offer two beers, and it's not cheap. After the \"cool\" factor wears off, you realize that you're paying extra to pour your own beer. Not so cool. The upside is the fact that I get beers for myself much faster than the servers at El Hefe did for me.   The booth seats are covered in plastic, in the style of your great grandmother. This is assuming, of course, that your great grandmother commissioned Ed Hardy to design her living room group. The ambiance isn't my style, but I'm sure that a lot of people love it...The biggest issue I had is the way the food is brought to the table. They start you with chips and salsa. It seems hard to screw up chips and salsa, but it happened here. The salsa comes in small jars that are downright weird, and they make dipping your chip absolutely impossible. You need to be a salsa MacGyver to figure out how to get the right amount of salsa on your chip...It's strange. After pushing some salsa around with a chip on a small plate for a while, our food arrived. Apparently, when you order tacos, they come 5-6 at a time, placed on wooden slabs that are roughly the size of a Las Vegas buffet. Our server couldn't remember who's tacos were who's, so we played a game of musical tacos (and wooden slabs) until we all figured out what we'd ordered. When a group of 4-5 orders 10+ tacos, you end up with 2-3 giant wooden slabs on your table and a very confusing family style presentation.   Like I said before, the duck taco I had was pretty good, and I hear good things about the BeerRita. However, unless I'm dragged against my will by a large group of people, I don't see myself returning to El Hefe anytime soon.",

    "text": "Bought a groupon to try out El Hefe..note I am past the club age and honestly I was a little unsure of the place. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm, parked right in front and was told we could sit anywhere.  Not a huge place by any means as all the booths were full, so we sat at a high top table. The place has a bar feel but that was to be expected.  I got a margarita,  the one with the OJ and Grand Marnier, it was really good (I will admit to preferring frozen) but this on the rocks version was tasty. The drink was $10 but it was rather large so worth the price. We then ordered the queso fundido, oh my one of the best I have had. It came with great chips with sea salt and five of their little tortillas.  Both the husband and I ordered the three taco plate, I hate the braised beef, duck carnitas and the mushroom taco. All pretty good, the husband got pork al pastor (his favorite), chicken tinga and the cod. He also loved the corn that came as the side. The cilantro rice I barely ate. All inall we will be back and I am goinf to try their nachos, they looked amazing. We definitely will also order less due to sheer size but had to order at least $40 for the groupon. Great deal. Now this location is in the heart of old town Scottsdale and is across from Whiskey Row so be aware of the scene. But they have a Tempe location. We will definitely be back for lunch and some more of those yummy margaritas. I love trying new places through Groupon.",

    "text": "We came to Scottsdale for my sister's Bachelorette party weekend. We ended up eating at El Hefe. I had the carne asada and thought it was really good!! The atmosphere was fun and we had a great server! After eating we went back to our hotel to get ready for the night and decided to return for the rest of the night. There was no line to wait in because I think we got there early enough. We saw the server that waited on us earlier at dinner and she hooked us up with a Bachelor party that had a table. The music was great. There really wasn't any part of the night that was a bad experience. When we go back to Scottsdale we will definitely go to El Hefe.",

    "text": "Oh El Hefe... it has become one of our new spots to be at all the time.  Its not that the food or drinks are extraordinary but its just the place to be for the moment.  The atmosphere is a lot of fun.  The staff is really friendly and 80% of the time really attentive.  However, it is a very busy place at times so you gotta give them a break.  I've always had a great time here.  Beergaritas are a good deal.  Happy hour and sundayfundays are the best.",

    "text": "El Hefe is one of my favorite spots... whether it's a packed Saturday night or a laid back Tuesday evening. Either way, it's always a good time! Their churros are unreal. They are cooked to perfection and come with 3 different dipping sauces. Their tacos are bomb too! And let's talk about the drinks... the beer-garita is awesome. Margartia + Corona? Genius. And the fact that you can pour your own beer at the tables using taps is pretty kickass in my book too. Overall, my go to spot in Old Town!",

    "text": "This place is great for happy hour. $2 tacos, $5 32oz Coronas and Tecates and $5 margaritas. There tacos are delicious especially after a couple cervezas. They play great music, have good service and oh, did I mention a beer tap at your table? Not one of those tall things that pour 5 or 6 beers, and actual tap hooked up to a keg of Dos Equis and Coors light. I haven't stayed long enough to see this place morph into a night club, but it is worth checking out for happy hour anyday from 3-7PM.",

    "text": "My brother recommended that I try this place and I was a little skeptical based on the website alone. I thought it was a club or something. I went anyway and was soooo glad I did. The food is so damn good. I still think about it all the time! LOL! Why not 5 stars? It's so loud in there that you have to scream to have a conversation. It's a great place to watch the game and to hang out. Perhaps the outside seating area is a little quieter. Definitely give this place a try; you won't be disappointed.",
