    "text": "I absolutely love this place.  Here are my personal reasons:  -They have nutella coffee... that deserves 5 stars alone.   -They have great customer service.  They nearly always remember my husband's name since he is in there more often than I am.   -You can call in your coffee order ahead of time.... what?! Yes, you really can.  This is an amazing thing!  Take that Starbucks!   -They have great food and on Tuesday nights you can get $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta.  Don't get me wrong, I love Postino's for this deal, but this place actually has parking without the hassle! -You can bring your dog...although it seems like very few people take advantage of this. -They have bike racks for when we ride our beach cruisers over instead of walking -It's walking distance -Cute patio with misters and fresh herbs growing all around -The Nutella/Espresso martini.  It's no longer on the menu (or wasn't last time I was in), but I've asked and they've still made it for me.  So. Freaking.Good.  If you aren't convinced yet, stop reading this and just go try it out.    Don't expect a huge menu or a large indoor seating area.  It's tiny and it's meant to be a great, tiny, local spot.  Go when the weather is nice and sit outside while sipping a nutella martini and eating bruschetta.  If you're disappointed, then I'm not sure what to tell you.",

Such a great place to hang out with a glass of wine.   The coffee is excellent and I've never had any issues in the drive-thru. I've tried a few of their limited/ seasonal lattes and they've all been great. The lunch menu is excellent- the salads and sandwiches are incredible. Try the tuna and the omg.  I've never had any issues with long wait times. In fact, I'm amazed at how quickly they get food out- the kitchen is miniscule.",

We've tried several of the sandwich and been very happy with all of them.    They have a full espresso bar and it the drinks are very good.  I used to own a coffee house, so I'm picky about my espresso.  Service has always been friendly to us and our two dogs who usually accompany us.  We have a Doberman that has excellent restaurant manners and a whippet puppy who has well puppy manners.    If you come for dinner ask to be seated.  Yes even on the patio and despite the fact you didn't see the sign.  If you don't prepare to be scolded.  Keep perspective and smile.  They are just doing their best to keep everyone happy.    I really enjoy this place and drop in whenever I'm in the area, which always seems to be with my dogs.",

There is a very cool little patio with plenty of shade and it is dog friendly.  There is a small seating area inside that is very modern and comfortable.  There is a good size espresso bar where you can watch the baristas do their magic.    We ordered two breakfast burritos and the Nutella banana sandwich.  The breakfast burritos were extremely good.  The ingredients are very fresh and there is no need to add anything.  Although there was a very yummy green salsa that I choose to add.  The Nutella sandwich was amazing!   Perfect for a small snack!  We also ordered a vanilla latte and a Bloody Mary.   The latte was very good - not overly sweet and very light.  The only downside I experienced at this place was with the Bloody Mary.  It wasn't good at all and I wasn't able to finish.    All things considered it was a cool place to grab a quick bite and enjoy some socializing.   We will definitely be back.",

If I wasn't there on a date, I would have made out with it. I'm not scared to admit that.   I also had a Mai Tai which was so good as well. Strong enough to be fun but not so strong so that you have to wait for the ice to melt. Maybe if I had a 3rd Mai Tai, I would have made out with the sandwhich.   Would be nice though if the staff frequented the patio and took your order. Was kind of a buzzkill to have to go back inside and wait in line to get another drink.",

No place in the valley makes it better than the baristas at 32S. I can't even find words to describe how delicious the pastries are! Of course the place gets busy... REALLY BUSY. Why?! Because everything about the place is F'ing awesome!! The staff gets a little (sometimes a lot) frantic, sure... Because they're trying to serve you. Sit down and relax (all you 1st time visitors who leave bad reviews). If you don't have time to hang out and enjoy the ambience, maybe go another day when you do. Don't expect fast (Shit) food because this is not that place. The line out the door isn't because the place is mediocre... Au Contraire! I'll say it again, it's Amazing and worth the wait. Sincerely, Tried, True and returning customer p.s. The owner is pretty frigin cool, too!",

We entered the restaurant and stood around waiting for somebody to guide us to a place to sit.  Finally, a guy comes over and asks our preference and we tell him outdoors will be fine.  He seats us and we wait for about five minutes.  Finally, a waitress (Ithink the owner) comes over and tells us harshly \"you can't sit here\".  I say \"we were seated by a waiter\".  She says you can't sit here.  I ask why.  She says, \"because it is reserved for a large group\".  I say \"where can we sit\".  She leads us to the indoor seating.  We sat and waited for 20 minutes.  Nobody attempted to wait on us.  Finally, we got up and walked out.  Saw her again on the way out and said,'your service sucks\".  She just looked at me - no apology, no excuses.  This lady is evil.  Saw a broom in a parking space on the way to the car.  Surmised it must be her mode of transportation.  This is unfortunate.  This place has the ability to be a real bright spot in our neigborhood.

Except for one that called it a formed egg burrito which made me laugh but was the most accurate. I finally took the time to drive out to 32 Shea after being excited about it for so long. I honestly went for the coffee but recent reviews were highlighting the food. I ordered the Nutella mocha & New Mexican burrito. I give it 2 stars for the mocha because it was just ok. Nothing special from my standpoint as I'm always looking for that distinct flavor of espresso but it was not to be so. However the New Mexican burrito was just SAD!!! A formed egg, bacon that looks like its from Wendy's bacon, and potatoes on a store bought package of tortillas. Seriously yelpers the McDonald's burritos have more flavor than that! Ok I'll get off the New Mexican burrito because the salsa was actually pretty good. The mocha wasn't bad just didn't really standout. I probably won't be back. Cartel, Echo, Nami are better spots.",

    "text": "Two words: Lavender Latte  Holy, thank you Lord for this delicious concoction and for this homely place called 32 Shea.  Looks like a bar ... but let me tell you it feels like home- without a doubt.   I had a lovely cashier who was just a sweetheart and was sporting a leather hat that I was mirin', he was quick to take my order yet made it feel unrushed and was sure to answer my questions. I got the Lavender Latte and Steel Cut Oats with fruit. My order came out in a timely manner and was absolutely perfect. The Lavender Latte was out of this world and had beautiful smooth latte art. My biggest thing with Lavender and Rose (floral) flavors in food or coffee is the balance, too much and it's like you're eating soap though when it lacks it's underwhelming. 32 got it spot on in the middle, it was amazing. The oats were good, typical steel cut and more on the wet side. It came with slices of banana, berry, cinnamon and brown sugar. It also didn't cost an arm and a leg, so you can bet the portion is about a cup or so. Prices aren't too bad either!  32 Shea has a spacious open patio, that is secluded enough to make you forget you're sitting in a random plaza parking lot. Serves up great coffee and provides killer food, also they have a twelve hour happy hour. Did I grab a craft beer at 9 in the morning? No, but now I know that I can without some kind of judgement being passed here. Limited space indoors, but airy and open enough to get fresh air and light with a view of the bar as well. Really great vibe here, everyone seems to be in the best mood and looks like there are tons of frequents ... which isn't surprising.  Can't wait to try out their Rosemary syrup, Nutella Mocha, Green Smoothie and Toddy next!",

They have a great oasis patio area with trees for shade and misters during hot days. The modern hip feel of 32 Shea gives it a lot of energy and the place gets hopping during peak hours. The lobby area can get a little tight, but at the same time it's nice to feel up close to the people who are making the drinks. They are dog friendly and occasionally host dog adoption events. I got the New Mexico burrito and really liked the green sauce that came with it. My Iced Toddy was perfect to combat the warm weather outside. An enjoyable experience and I look forward to stopping in again.",

I wish this place were larger and had a bigger bar. They have a sign out front most days about a wine special. I hesitate to go bc I don't know if I will be guaranteed a space at the bar. Totally fine but we are bar people. I recently called ahead and ordered a gluten free stacked turkey sandwich, drove thru and picked it up, so fast, so frickin delicious! I love that sandwich!!!! My boyfriend goes pretty often for happy hour he also loves it. His jam is the roast beef sliders. Yum. All in all my only wish were if it were bigger! One last thing, I had the most amazing cocktail here, of course I can't remember what it is called but it has house made rosemary syrup and gin and bubbles (amongst a few other ingredients) SO SO GOOD!

    "text": "Ate here a few times before. Food is just okay, and usually sounds like it would taste better than it actually does, but would rate food 6 out of 10. The one star is for attitude and atmosphere, which caused us to leave without dining here tonight.  They advertise this place has a dog friendly patio, and we thought we'd take our dog with us (primarily because we were feeling a bit guilty with both of us working long hours).  When we arrived, the patio was full of diners except for one bar height table for six, which the host said he could clean for us. We were tired after working and really didn't want to go anywhere else with our small dog, so we agreed the high top table would be OK. (We debated this because our dog is very small, and their posted rules do not allow him to sit on the chair.)  After standing for a while waiting for them to finish cleaning and resetting the table, a woman brazenly yelled out to the waiter that she really wanted to eat on the patio, and although she was already seated at an open window table inside the restaurant, told the waiter she expected to be seated at that table outside. So, without a word of apology to us, the waiter gave her our promised table. Then, after the waiter seated the woman, the host said to us, \"the table is really big enough to share.\"  Share???  Who said we wanted to share?  Needless to say, after a long weekday of work, and with a dog in hand on leash who was also expecting to eat, we weren't looking to share a table for six or make dinner conversation with a  stranger.. So we said, \"thanks, but we weren't planning on dining communally tonight.\" Then left...disappointed, tired, hungry, and with dog in hand.   I admit I'm not a fan of trendy communal dining, although I have nothing against it for those who may like it.  This, however, was not a communal table, but only a table for six.  This was also very poorly handled by both the waiter and host, and extremely presumptuous of the restaurant to expect two parties to be okay with sharing a high-top table for six without even asking either party's permission first.",

I don't know where management finds these clowns but they are always rushed, sassy, and bothered by the fact that you're ordering from them. Go home and take a nap and come back when you're ready to work and provide customer service! I live right across the street and would prefer to drive out of my way to go somewhere else.",

I was scoffed at for trying to upgrade my smoothie to a large after already swiping my card (gladly willing to pay) they though I was crazy. Finally they said they'll get it taken care of. NOW ABOUT THE SMOOTHIE.... they claim its a fresh made Green Smoothie with a long list of healthy superfoods. (See bottom of photo) This smoothie was LITERALLY Naked Juice Green Machine blended up with some almond milk. I saw them pour it into the blender, $6.50 for a 10oz glass of naked juice is what I bought. I also had the \"southwest burrito\" sounded delicious and hearty when described. It was a tiny taco bell size burrito with egg, potato, and hard bacon bits. Sad. The only reason they still get 2 starts is because it didn't taste bad. But I could have just stopped at Circle K and had the same meal for a lot less than $20.",

On this occasion my friend and I came for happy hour and it started out with who I think was the manager greeting us while counting her drawer and right away we could tell she was annoyed we were even standing in front of her. She rolled her eyes at us and from there it just got worse. Male bartender was very friendly and made up for the unpleasantness of this \"manager\". When we went back for another round we got another female server who I think might dislike her job a lot and you can tell. She was just as rude and honestly made us feel like we were just a bother to her. My friend and i discussed about never coming here again and taking our money somewhere else. Was going to stay for dinner but decided we didn't want to be a \"bother\" to these girls who clearly don't like their job. Both being managers ourselves in this industry we know how stressful this job can be but please learn how to not take it out on your guests. So sad we lost a neighborhood go to spot.",

I had the cold drip coffee and my friend had regular coffee. Wow I had never had the cold drip - a new favorite of mine now. As for the burrito- we both took half home for the next day.  Next we are going to do lunch for the roast beef sandwich or the special and a martini. Can't wait.  A real gem in our backyard.",

We sat close to 30 minutes after we ordered waiting for our food, people were showing up ordering and getting their food and we still weren't getting our order. (A burrito we were splitting) After I was thoroughly annoyed my wife went in and asked, bla, bla, bla they'd have it out as soon as they could a few minutes later we got an over nuked disgusting chunk we couldn't even eat after a good try though we left what was left of what some third world country folk would maybe accept on the table and walked out. Perhaps this is why we stopped coming before. Maybe in a few years when I forget this terrible experience I'll try it again .",

Never had a reason to stop in until my gal-friend, who lives on the west side(!), suggested we meet there for dinner. Now... I hang my head in shame. I should have been the one saying \"Oh, you have to try 32 Shea. It's amazing!\" Well, I am now a fan and we plan on going monthly. This will give me the opportunity to try EVERYTHING.   This visit I had the Roast Beef Sliders. I can't express to you how melt-in-your-mouth moist the beef was, and the wee buns were incredibly soft (I'm sure it's an artisan bread and not just a \"bun\"). And the horseradish spread was delish! We didn't partake in any leaded beverages, but they have a pretty nice selection.  I think the most amazing part of this experience is... you forget you are seated just yards from 32 St. Not an overwhelmingly busy stretch of road, but it does have its fair share of traffic. No matter to me! The strategically placed trees, music and staff divert distract and engage successfully!  The only reason i took off a star is its size, especially indoors. Very \"quaint.\" The outdoor patio is a great location, though, when the weather is kind.   Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves and look forward to returning.",

They always have something different on their dinner menu, so it's worth following their facebook feed to get alerts on what new dish they've whipped up each night.   For coffee several highlights are their Americano (great flavor), their Mochas (you can get them with nutella instead of chocolate syrup) and their drip coffee is great too.   For drinks they have a great wine selection and some creative spins on martinis, including their espresso-tini (amazing drink).   For food I love their new mexico burrito, their toasted nutella & banana sandwich, but can't beat their OMG sandwich (hands down the highlight of their menu) with mascarpone, figs, honey and prosciutto on toasted ciabatta. Great dinner selections and the plus there is the variety each night.",

The menu is small, but fresh, tasty and very reasonably priced. The bruschetta might be the best in town (sorry Postino's). The dingy strip mall surrounding the restaurant is a real eyesore, but they do an admirable job of creating your own little oasis in the cement.  They are pet friendly which makes it great for a Sunday morning bike ride with the pooch (the bloody Mary will knock you off your seat).  Be prepared to sweat. It is REALLY warm inside during the summer months.  The patio is cozy, covered & there is a mist system, but being surrounded by a huge mass of concrete diminishes the cooling effects.  Although the interior is cramped, everyone is friendly and the barkeep will remember your favorite drink and dish and the owners are often your neighbor on the bar stools. There are very few neighborhood watering holes or coffee shops around here and I am so happy for this spot. I would recommend it to anyone!",

    "text": "I have given this place two chances now. It has a great feel and is close to my home so I was hoping that it would be my new place for business and friend meetings. It has a bistro feel to it but doesn't want to be a friendly, hang out, bistro type of place. The staff is inattentive and rude. The food is decent but nothing special and I have to pay full price for an iced tea each time I want a refill. I try not to be cheap but that's $2.25 each time I fill up with plain old green tea. Perhaps the last straw was sitting in the patio area and watching the owner ask two people who had settled in with their two beautiful and well behaved dogs to move from a table with four chairs to a table with two when the place was nowhere near full. Then watching as she moved the umbrella that was shading our table back to another table almost knocking people and drinks over in the process.  This could be a great place but it needs a major attitude adjustment.",

Dined there last night on the reco from our movie-and-dinner partners.  It was a little chilly to eat on the outdoor patio by 8:30, but it's nice to know it's there.  Inside was cozy (maybe seating for 30 or so), and funky/hip without being pretentious.  Menu is compact - a handful of foodie-oriented salads, sandwiches and entrees and a daily special entree and lavosh pizza.   Our flatbread appetizers were nicely done.  My gumbo was absolutely delicious. The fresh basil leaves (from the garden outside) were a thoughtful, unexpected and delicious touch. Wife's roast beef sliders were also good. Great selection of local craft beers available.  Server was uber-friendly and helpful. Owner walked over and chatted with us. We'll definitely put it in the rotation.  I wouldn't drive a long way for it, but its a great neighborhood joint for a 5-10 minute drive.",

I've heard great things about it so I wanted to try it, I went around the lunch hour. I ordered the BLT with avocado and a side salad, it came on Chibatta bread which is one of my favorites, it was very good I just wish the bacon was a little bit less cooked so it wasn't quite so crumbly, it kept falling out of the sandwich. Otherwise very tasty. I also got a Nutella mocha which was amazingly decadent! I will definitely return, very quaint.",

The Early Bird Sandwich is so freakin good, the egg nice and fluffy (made me a little worried when I seen it), bacon nice & crispy, the perfect amount of avocado & mayo! My son had the New Mexico Burrito it was also really good! For coffee I had the Nutella Latte and it was the perfect balance of flavor, not too sweet so it was perfect for me. I can't wait to go back for happy hour (6am-6pm) WOW! A little tip if you are going when it's extremely hot outside, they have very limited indoor seating but a very nicely shaded outdoor area. Be prepared to sit outside no matter what time you go! Overall I really love this place!",

The sandwich with soup was $10 and one of the best cold sandwiches I've ever had. This sandwich has fig, mascarpone, and prosciutto .. what more could you ask for.   Small ish downside, I'm not from around here and it is HOT. Most of the seating looks like it's outside. Probably fine for a cooler day, but less comfy on a 100+ degree day.",

    "text": "First time since being in Arizona that I've gotten good coffee, being from the northwest I'm kind of a coffee snob. The reason I rated 4 stars was because the line in the morning takes forever, 12 minutes for a pretty easy order. I'm glad I didn't order food like I had planned. Another thing is that they have you pull forward to wait for your order, I understand the concept behind this.. but two people behind me got their orders at the window and left before the lady in front of me and I got ours. It's possible that they just got a drip so it's a quick pour and that's why they left first. But it's about guest perception, the average person who isn't in the service industry wouldn't think that way. Your better off just making everyone wait. I'll probably be back because I'm actually enjoying my coffee, but only if I have an extra 15 minutes to wait or just not on my way to work.",

We were able to take the little bit of wine we couldn't finish home. It's a sweet deal on Tuesday nights with the $20 wine bottle and three types of bruschetta. The wine with the special is all California,  which is a little unfortunate as I prefer to drink Italian wine, because of the amount of pesticides used to produce American wine. The Italian Pino Grigio  I tried last time was $8 a glass and wonderful. But this this time we just shared the bottle.",

Our order: early bird sandwich, bacon cheddar waffles and an iced vanilla latte jumbo size. Hubby loved the fact they had 32 oz cups available.   We sat down and waited patiently for our food. Our entrees come \"simple\" with no sides so the presentation isn't spectacular. The sandwich was ok, slightly slim. I enjoyed the bacon cheddar waffles.   Overall, quick, easy and we left full.",

When I pulled into the parking lot I was like whaaaat-- because it's the size of a Taco Bell and literally does have a drive through too, haha, but the inside and outdoor patio garden are SO cool!! It's all painted black inside with cool hippie bohemian decor! This place is pretty hipster. The patio has string lights, lanterns, water bowls for dogs, and tons of greenery! Also, I'm a bit of a bathroom snob and this bathroom is really neat. There is a disco ball reflecting colorful lights on the black bathroom walls, and vintage green chair and chandelier in the bathroom!  Food: 3 stars. I ordered the early bird sandwich for brunch and it was okay--basically, a really fluffy plain egg on toast. Would have been better with more of the avocado spread and tomato for increased flavor.   I also got the Nutella iced latte and it was really chocolatey and cold, not overly sweet either--perfect!   There's also a good selection of booze, sandwiches, soups, salads, and gluten free options. Definitely recommend this place!",

The outside seating is ample if you feel that it's a bit stuffy to be indoors. They keep it dark inside, mood lighting for sure.  I ordered the charcuterie board ($15), nutella cheesecake ($7) and their special expresso, ice cream, liqueur drink ($8). It did take more than 20 minutes, but I did ask for everything to show up at once, so fair is fair. The specialty drink, wasn't even all the way full? Either use a smaller glass or fill it all the way up.   It's kinda funny, but I spent 32$ at 32 Shea (with tax) lol but seriously, it's not the cheapest place, but the quality of their food is really superb. I recommend their charcuterie board as it had a good Mediterranean vibe too it (a touch salty). The nutella cheesecake was mediocre at best and their Specialty drink was decent.  Solid service, decent food, great ambience: this is an overall 4 stars in my opinion.",

I really love this place - especially their outdoor patio. The way that the owners have worked to convert an old photomat into a spot of relaxation and good vibe is amazing. It's small but I've always been able to get a table and their outdoor patio is dog friendly.  I've been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and all three have been a good experience. They even have a drive-thru for coffee in the mornings. For breakfast, I like the egg-white bites. Their flatbreads change daily and they also do some specials during the week that my family enjoys like burgers and milkshakes.  Their cocktails are innovative and delicious and its a great relaxing spot for connecting with friends after work.  There was recently a fundraising campaign for an elderly gentleman in the area and when I went on the website to make a donation, I saw that 32Shea had made a generous contribution for this man. This is the type of business that I want to support.",

    "text": "Guess where 32 Shea is?? Yup, geniuses, it's 32nd Street and Shea Blvd! Yet, I somehow managed to pull right next to it, and still had to ask a pedestrian if they knew where it was. \"That's it. You're right here!\" she said. LOL Well, who could see it with all those trees surrounding it!   Despite my ability to get lost at my actual destination, the aforementioned trees actually surround a rather lovely little patio cafe where one could easily get conveniently lost for a short time, quite happily. The interior is small but kitschy, hip and cute. The tables are nestled closely together so don't plan on much privacy. What you can count on are some inventive drink flavorings. I asked my nice barista for a recommendation and she mentioned how they make many of their own syrups for flavorings. I followed her recommendation with a house made honey-rosemary syrup infused chai tea latte, dirty. It was delicious! I really love it when any eatery makes their own blends of anything. It sets a business apart and is greatly appreciated!  Now, I didn't have any food, so I can't speak to that, but I am looking forward to going back on my next trip. It's a little bit of a drive but that's a great area for trying out little places so it could easily be coupled with other restaurants and outings. I highly recommend asking and taking one of the barista's suggestions. It certainly worked for me! Then take it out on the patio. Come on Phoenicians! In this weather, we Chicagoans would be eating up that scene outside. ;)",

    "text": "I think it's an Arizona pandemic - crappy owners who employ awesome staff.   Exceptional environment. I mean, they nailed the coffee shop/mid-tier restaurant theme with zeal. The outdoor patio is an oasis in the barren, skid-mark stained landscape, known as Phoenix.   The staff are stunning. Energetic, enthusiastic, engaging, informative, very talented. Great mixology, great cappuccino, great latte art, great integration of figs into so many culinary delights.   So what's the issue with this place. Straight up, the owner. I think her name is Rebecca? You'll know you're talking to the owner because she's the one who's stressed out, operating in a state of chaos, rude to her staff, rude to customers, and overall, just very short & unfriendly. I don't know if her posture and attitude is intentional or not, but it affects the customer experience in the most unfortunate ways. Like a ripple in water, it affects the entire lake.   We have had groups there, we have taken our closest friends, my wife and I have gone and worked there for several hours on our laptops pounding out work, we have recommended it to so many people in our massive network - and without question, when the owner is there, everyone who has experienced it, agrees that the owner is detrimental to the success of the customer service experience.   An example? I listened to her chastise one of her employees in front of other customers for letting my wife and I sit at a 4-top inside. The employee tried to explain that we had been there for a coupe of hours and had spent well over $50 in our time there, but she did not have time to hear it. She approached out table, asked if we wanted a refill, and told us that if they needed the table they would be asking us to leave/relocate. Very abrupt with resting bit#h face the entire time.   We suggested that we would be happy to move outside, but recognized that the outside was the most popular place for her customers, so we opted to stay indoors to alleviate taking her most popular seats. She suggested we go sit on the dilapidated outdoor couch (out of sight, out of mind so it seemed.)  I grew up in the restaurant business. My father has owned and operated many casual and fine dining establishments. I have worked FOH & BOH in my early days. I understand restaurant ethics and expectations well, and it's not that she was even wrong in her desire to have us relocate to accommodate a larger group, if one showed up - it's that her delivery was so retched, that it steered us out the door shortly there after. We felt unwanted & undervalued as customers because she choose to operate with a lack of socially acceptable communication (both verbal & non-verbal) skills. It's very unfortunate.   As a former corporate executive of a 500+ employee organization, and now multi-business owner, I would deeply encourage the owner to take note of this review. Hire staff for their expertise, train them on your expectations & policy, and then give them the slack that they need to do what it is that they do best, their jobs. Leadership is not a position or a title, it is action and example. For 32 Shea, after reading so many other customer reviews that validate our experiences, I would recommend the immediate decapitation of owner/customer interactions.   Here's hoping things change. Maybe if we know the owners schedule, we can plan our visits around when she'll be there? That seems ideal for now, because I've got lots of money to spend at local, owner operated coffee shops - but 32 Shea ain't gonna be one of them as long as this woman continues to employ the \"No Fu#!s to Give\" customer service approach to business ownership. ;)",

The surrounding area is so \"ho hum\" and almost sketch, you would never think you would find a cute coffee hangout. There is a small patio area surrounded by greenery and small tables perfect for conversation. The benches against the fence have colorful square pillows lining the entire back and umbrellas provide perfect shade for midday sun. The ambiance is peaceful and inspiring.  Indoors is a little darker and more intimate setting since the shop is not as spread out as the patio. There were sandwiches available and some pastries to accompany whatever coffee you may enjoy. I tried a dirty chai latte. Although I asked for it cold, I received a hot one, but I didn't bother to have him change it, because I didn't really care one way or another. It was really good! I am just curious to have it cold next time. Or maybe I'll try the pumpkin latte... They had quite a few choices and the menu was very clear on their chalkboard overhead. The staff is really friendly and talkative as are the people who seem to be regulars here. There is really nothing bad to be said about this place at all, except for that one minor mistake. I do plan on returning again when I'm in the area.",

My review is based solely off of portion size and quality of freshness . I ordered the lunch caprese salad and asked the guy if it was a big salad or should I order something else to go along with it he said no that salad was big enough . I got it to go and when I got home I was very surprised with what they call a salad ?  there were 4 slices of mozzarella which was an ok portion but there was 4 tiny shreds of lettuce on top that did not even cover the cheese not surround it oh And some rotting tomatoes ? It was not even edible besides the cheese I really wanted to like this place but don't think know that I will be returning :(",

During our drinking days, we treated ourselves to their blueberry margaritas which are phenomenal and are seasoned with fresh blueberries!  Now the iced tea is our drink of choice!

I let one of the servers know so next time they could prepare it better! instead she asked me if I wanted to now talk to the owner... no I just wanted to pass on that it wasn't a good experience & I was disappointed! ..not talk to 3 different people about how bad it was while they look down at me. she tried to blame it on the gluten free bread - but that was actually really good! just not the bottom pieces that were soaked & soggy... be nice to your customers! cute environment, good mimosa, but subpar food & weird vibes when trying to pass on a message to management.",

Everyone who I have encountered is upbeat and friendly, my coffee is always awesome, and if I hit it just right, the drive-thru is quick and painless.   32 Shea was suggested to me countless times since I drop my kids off at school up the street everyday. After waking up one morning and deciding that I was done with my usual Starbucks routine I figured I would give them a try. I pulled up to the drive thru and it was four cars deep. Not a big deal one would usually think, but when you are someone who orders food and need to pull forward with nowhere to go, it gets a little tricky. Thankfully I got my coffee and only had to wait a few minutes for the other cars in front of me to be on their way. I almost didn't give this place another shot after that, but I'm glad I did. Every other experience has been much quicker.  Be sure to ask for a punch card. Buy 10 coffees or teas, get one free.",

    "text": "Three years ago, I checked out the new 32 Shea (named for the corner I've lived near my whole life!), and said I appreciated their presence. Well, three years later, I still do! I stopped in today for a late breakfast and coffee. During the day, I like to do work here-they have outlets and I can sit by the windows overlooking their patio, which gives the illusion of a garden, not a big old intersection!  I ordered the New Mexico Burrito, which was superb! Especially the green salsa on the side. I am also a big fan of their caramel macchiatos.  At night, I am enticed by all their happy hour deals. There's $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta night, and burger and shake night. They keep me informed of these deals on their pretty food photog Instagram page!   There's also an added summer bonus: it's nice and cool inside at 32 Shea. Something about the indie music, iced beverages, and dark walls. Whether I'm here after a YouFit workout or I've just burned my hand on my car door, stepping into 32 Shea always cools me down. So thanks, 32 Shea. I'm glad you're in the hood.",

Conveniently located near the 51 freeway and 32nd street  (you can also get off at Shea), this place has a unique selection combined with common favorites  (like a breakfast croissant or BLT).  I love the green smoothie and homemade soups and muffins. If you get a chance, try the watermelon gaspacho or white mocha lavender muffin, made fresh daily. But once they're gone, they're gone, so go early!  There's a cool funky vibe and wonderful staff. Worth stopping for sure!",

We felt ignored, waited a long time for our drinks... never received our 2 round (decided to cancel and leave instead) and then waited a long time for our bill.  It was clear that they were overwhelmed by their popularity and not staffed adequately. My 3 friends probably wondered why I bragged so much about the place... but I will chalk this up as an exception and will give it another chance.",

They cure their own salmon and serve it with a good amount of cream cheese, a toasted bagel, slivered red onion, a carrot and daikon mixture and capers (they need to add a few more capers to each order, i only had 4 on each half and I really like those little buggers).  They have happy hour all day so you can accompany your breakfast with a $5 mimosa. There is no table service, so walk in and order at the register, then your food is delivered to your table and if you're lucky the chef himself will come out and chat about his food. The service here is never warm and fuzzy, but they get the job done and I always leave happy.",

After 15 minutes of watching several cars go through the drive thru and people receive orders from the counter, we asked about our order. The response was \"oh, it must be sitting in back\".  So while we waited for our order, it sat in back getting cold.   Upon eating the breakfast we ordered, we were sorry we had tried this place again. The breakfast burritos are just not good. The coffee is ok, but not worth the price.   Too bad this neighborhood joint can't get it together. We will not be going back.",

    "text": "I really want to love this place but they'll have to step it up for that to happen. For you speed readers, here's the nutshell: GOOD FOOD, pleasant but *very* slow service, smallish but tasty menu, good beer list, okay wine list, awesome dog-friendly patio with a fountain, great music and vibe. Great features on certain nights of the week (see photos). So tonight, my first time here, I came at 6:30 in the evening, in time for a gorgeous AZ sunset on their awesome little [less than half full] patio, but sadly too late for happy hour. Next time... First and foremost, service was so so so slow. I've been in the industry for twenty years, as a server and manager at places from Chili's to Chelsea's to Mary Elaine's so I totally know and consider all the little cogs moving inside a restaurant \"machine\" during service. I even took into consideration that I was alone, thus more sensitive to the passing of time. My server was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, but he simply needed more support. From what I could tell, he had the twelve table patio all by himself with only one other gentleman bussing and refilling waters. That is simply too much to balance in order to give proper service (but remember I mentioned it was less than half full when I arrived...? No good reason for such slow service). That being said, the food was very fresh and tasty, and worth the prices. I got the daily lavosh pizza and it was TO DIE FOR. Crispy prosciutto, almond slices, diced apples, mozzarella, and arugula. Wow. They have a nice beer list, a few fun craft cocktails, and an okay wine list, which needs to be updated. I ordered a bottle (1/2 off bottles on Monday -- yes please!), but twenty five minutes later when it finally arrived (yes, 25 min, I actually clocked it.. my hummus app arrived first, which was 23 min after ordering) it was a completely different bottle than listed on the menu. I actually only noticed bc the vintage was different. Nbd as by that point I just wanted a flipping glass of wine already and it was actually quite good.  Inside is super cute and I can tell they have good decorating sense though it needs some sprucing up (new paint, at least in the restroom). *Love* all the plants hanging around. Overall it's a quaint little local spot, but I'll just keep it in the back of my mind that I should come here expecting service to be slow. That way maybe I'll be impressed if it's better next time.",

The patio was relaxing and there were fans and misters also. The only reason I didn't give five stars was because some of the staff weren't very friendly. Definitely a place to go for good food, but not necessarily for great service.",

I also adore the OMG sandwich. The staff are always friendly even though they work in a tight space and are often very busy.  This is also a great place to get some work done. My old podcast was born here and my partner and I spent countless hours getting work done on it. We also love to meet up for relaxed breakfast and lunch here.   Great music. Great vibe. Great place. Oh, and they have the trippiest bathroom in Phoenix.",

    "text": "While visiting Phoenix we actually headed to a very well-known breakfast restaurant in the area, but they were closed for Memorial Day holiday. I quickly pulled up Yelp, saw this place was just a few minutes away and had high ratings and headed over. From my quick scan of the reviews, I somehow got the impression that this place was a full-on restaurant (perhaps based on the two dollar sign price range) that happened to serve breakfast, so I wasn't really expecting much.   We followed the GPS and found the restaurant in a shopping center across from a Walgreens. The colorful graphics on the outside of the place looked cute and quirky and I noticed they had a drive-thru.  \"What is this place?\" I asked myself -- clearly, it was not a fancy sit-down restaurant... was it actually a fast-food joint?  We walked inside to find a little counter and a number of tables. The woman behind the cash register explained that for breakfast it was self-seating and that we just order at the counter, get our food, and pick out a table ourselves.  We walked through to the patio and found the most adorable outdoor space!  The entire patio has complete tree coverage -- essential for the unforgiving Arizona heat/sun -- and there's the gentle sound of running water thanks to a zen garden + fountain in the back.  The prices were CHEAP!  The very excellent egg, bacon, avocado, and potato burritos were only $5.50 and came with a green chili dipping sauce which was delicious and really hit the spot. We also ordered the Green Shake on their menu, which was under $6. My husband loved the shake so much, he quickly drank his down and went back inside to order another.  Loved the casual vibe of this place. Music was indie rock (Foster the People, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers). Staff was really nice as well. Everyone seemed to be having a great time and you could feel free to take as long as you wanted to eat there.  Would definitely recommend coming here for a cheap and pleasant breakfast/brunch with friends. Perfect spot!  If I'm ever back in Phoenix, would come back to try out their dinner for sure.",

I greatly adored the garden type outdoor seating and fountain. It was also nice that they allowed pets, its not often I get to go out to eat with my small dog.  In the evening I would recommend getting the bruchetta board, I've tried all the types and they're all very tasty.  It's one of my main places to go in Phoenix. I would definitely recommend going!",

The famous New Mexico Burritos got rave reviews and disappeared in a flash. 32 Shea is locally owned and operated and the owner was so accommodating and efficient that she came in extra early to assemble our order and had it available on time and even earlier than the 6:30 AM pick up requested. The house made  Green Salsa had just enough kick to complement the delicious bite size  egg, potato, cheese, avocado and bacon (optional) burrito platter. They also provided me with their exceptional Coffee- to- Go in a large ready to pour travel container. Next time I will add the outstanding Nutella Mocha Coffee, my personal fav.  32 Shea is a little oasis in the middle of a shopping center with easy parking and access, a lovely patio, and a drive through for those on the go. The owner and staff of 32 Shea are flexible, efficient, exhibit a total \"can do\" attitude, and radiate positivity. The quality of the food and the service cannot be beat for local, fresh, and delicious. They aim to please. I would not hesitate to use them again for all my catering needs for brunches, lunches, or meetings.",

These two girls (new since my last visit there) work there who have no concept of waiting on people, let alone running a business.

What a shame that the good food and drink and nice ambience of the place has been ruined by an incompetent staff. It was like the place has been taken over by high schoolers. Too many other wine bars are out there that provide consistent customer service for me to bother returning to this place ever again.",

Last night we were on yelp looking for a wine bar and this came up so, questioning whether it was categorized correctly, we stopped in.  Wonderful intimate atmosphere, nice patio, a unique menu for both food and spirits.  The reason for the lack of stars, they were out of the wine we wanted, the second choice was a light beer and they only have those rich beers. When I decided on a cocktail, they offered a Jalapeno margarita on their website so I inquired to find they don't make them anymore because people complained they were too hot. She did however offer to make one if they had jalapenos which was nice. I went for the mint lemon drop martini to keep it safe.  Very good!  I ordered the chopped chicken salad.  It was large And came with generous amounts of bacon.  SOLD me right there. My husband ordered roast beef sliders which were delicious.  The service was a bit slow but we weren't in a hurry and they advertise that they take time for preparation.  Everyone around us seemed relaxed and really enjoying themselves!  I would definitely go back.  Oh, and their happy hour looked very decent.",

The gentleman at the window was friendly and patient, he suggested the Vanilla/Honey Latte Iced, this was my first experience here so I was grateful for the suggestion. It was FANTASTIC! I also ordered the breakfast burrito which was delicious, (their home made salsa was perfect) & it did NOT weigh 10lbs so I still feel fantastic after devouring it, not like I want to curl up, clenching my stomach, and sleep for 10 days. The service was also prompt, and the gal who walked my order out to my car was super friendly! Prices were very reasonable as well! This experience sure beats out the long line, hasty service, tiny over-priced cups of joe, and hard pastrys, at your local chain Starbucks. They also serve a great variety of craft brews and wines and, have a comfy, dog friendly, patio! I will definitely be back when I am in the area again!

The location is not the best, but once you are inside, you can't even tell you are in the middle of an old strip shopping center on 32nd street.  It was very nice on the patio and had a great ambience.  When we arrived, the hostess was rude and kept walking by us with a scowl on her face.  Took quite a while for them to get a table together and even then it was too small.  Luckily, most people were sharing food so we had enough room.  The waitress was impatient and forgot to bring one drink (which we later had to have removed from the bill).  I ordered a tuna salad with house made blue cheese dressing.  It was very good.  One of our group ordered a delicious coffee drink and another ordered the moscow mule and said it was great.  One person went to the bar for a margarita and it literally took 20 minutes.  She did like the drink and said it was the strongest she ever had.  When it came time to pay, the waitress said she could not do separate checks and even asked the owner, who also said no, not for big groups.  Would have been nice to know when we sat down.   I asked if there was an ATM and she said no.  I asked if there was one in the shopping center nearby and she said she had no idea.  Instead of giving us any options she simply walked away.  About 10 minutes later, we learned from the owner that while they would not do separate checks, they would allow multiple credit cards.  Again, just tell us and there is no problem.  I really want to try some of their signature cocktails, so I may go back.",

I had two along with a Chicken Raspberry Salad. Delicious. If it weren't for a group run later that same evening I would have stayed and tried a slice of the Nutella Mascarpone Cheesecake.  It's not even Noon and I'm craving a Nutella Espresso Martini -- give me strength Patron Saint of All Things Nutella!!!!",

I've watched countless newcomers arrive and not know how seating works so they stand around trying to find anyone who can help.

Ordered an Irish Coffee. Charged $7 and had to ask multiple times about if it was an Irish Coffee or not as there was absolutely nothing but coffee in the cup. Attitude here, could be a better place if the staff would be more attentive and less concerned about themselves.",

    "text": "I had actually heard about this place from Yelp a year ago but only recently got around to trying it. It's close to our house, but out of the way when we are driving to work, which is a real bummer because I want to grab lattes and breakfast here all the time now!   11/21/12: Driving by this place, it could be a little hard to miss the turn, but they have an outside patio and a drive thru that becomes visible once you get closer. After debating if I wanted to eat alone outside, I decided to use the drive thru so I could take it home and eat. I ordered the New Mexico Burrito and a medium iced vanilla latte. The latte was crafted quickly and I drove forward to wait for the burrito. One sip and I immediately knew this latte was AMAZING. I am a coffee snob who can't stand bitter coffee/espresso or exceedingly sweet syrups, but this was neither. The vanilla flavor was strong, but not too sweet. The espresso wasn't over powering and mixed well with the milk and vanilla. Overall, one of the best latte's I've had. Within minutes, my burrito was ready and an employee walked it out to my car. Once home, I cut the burrito in half, slathered some of the homemade green chili sauce that was included on top, and dug in. Mmm, it was good. I even took a pic and emailed the husband, just to make him jealous! Thrilled with my drink and delicious burrito, I promised to take him here next time.  12/2/12: My mother-in-law was in town, so we stopped here for some early morning coffee. I ordered an iced vanilla latte, a blueberry muffin, and she ordered a regular coffee. Again my drink was fantastic and super quick service. My mother-in-law enjoyed her coffee and the sip she had from my drink. The muffin was delicious as well!  Overall, this place is truly a gem! It's small but the decor is nice and welcoming.  The staff is friendly and the service is quick. I'm really looking forward to going back!",

    "text": "My review is in two parts....first the food and service,  I came here solely on the write up in the North Central Phoenix News which gave this place very favorable reviews, especially the Mint Lemon Drop Martini.  I am a HUGE lemon drop fan so that is what made me make the short drive up the 51 to find this cute little bistro.  Its an adorable little place with a great dog friendly patio and cozy inside space.  I took a seat at the bar but quickly moved outside because it was just too warm.  The bartender was charming and very informative and made me my Mint Lemon Drop which was just as tasty as I was hoping it would be.    I wasn't that hungry but wanted to nosh on something so I had the Lahvosh of the day which was a bacon avocado.  The portion was plenty and the lahvosh was still crispy when it came to me and not soggy.  I ate every piece.  My only negative comment would be on the outside space....I sat at the outside bar and it was very uncomfortable.  The barstools don't have backs to them and the bar top is a little too high for comfort.  Also there was a lot of bird droppings on the bar top and it needs to be repainted.  The tables and chairs on the patio are metal and there are no cushions for the chairs which look like they would be very uncomfortable.  The ambience of the place is charming though and like I said, the food, drink and staff were just fine.  I will definitely go again but will probably ask for a table inside.  Cheers!",

We found 32 Shea through Yelp, only 1.5 miles from where we were, and it was just about perfect.  It was not easy to spot for those of use who weren't local, despite the fact that it's right out there by the street. Once we found it, though, we knew we'd picked a good spot. The enclosed patio was lovely, with a cute little fire hydrant water tap and bowls set up for dogs.  We had glasses of wine and a table that got a little sun. For a northerner, eating outside in December is quite the novelty, and I was going to get as much sun as I could in the process. The sandwiches and salads hit the spot.  My one \"if only\" concerns the lunchtime menu options. There was veg stuff, but it looked like asking for it without cheese would make it uninteresting. There were hummusy things on the dinner menu but not on the lunch. I ended up getting the tuna sandwich without cheese and figuring I'd pretend it didn't probably have mayo. I suppose I could also have asked if substituting hummus for cheese on the veg sandwich, but I may never know now.",

It was always SO GOOD!I brought my boyfriend there yesterday (1st time I've been there in a year or so) and was so disappointed. The guy who took our order was incredibly rude & didn't care to be there. Then my boyfriend & i both ordered the croissant sandwich and it was so disappointing! Bland & the eggs were wet. We both ended up getting sick a few hours later. Won't be back after that.",

It's also great for a casual work meeting place, as there's plenty inside and outside seating and the noise level is low.  Staff is always friendly and the food is pretty good.

It had a handful of (not) chopped spring lettuce mix , HALF of an egg, a sprinkle of diced bacon, half of an avocado, and maybe a tablespoon of cubed chicken. I couldn't even use the dressing as it was a paste. I'm pretty bummed. I was looking forward to a nice meal and the convenience of ordering it while my 2 year old twins and I could stay in the car.   I did enjoy my dirty chai tea latte. I can't recommend my girls' Nutella and banana sandwich.   I just wasted $20, i can't justify it, and I most definitely won't be back.   I have to say that the staff was very friendly. It's too bad the food is subpar.",

Every SINGLE time we have gone there they mess up our order or never bring our drinks? They are soooo slow and there isn't much going on? People always look around for staff. It's like they disappear! Then my mom worked 13 hours and called to make an order for pick up. A girl took the order. Then she comes in 20 mins later and they said sorry we lost the ticket. Then of course she waits another 20 mins for the simple sandwich! That sandwich should have been free for that amount of time. They gave her a stupid lunch ticket? Like that's going to help. This place needs serious help and has so much potential but we will not be going back.",

Maybe it's a glaring lack of breakfast burritos on the East Coast that makes me crave the New Mexico burrito, but honestly I think it's the delicious salsa that gets me so hyped.  The coffee is fantastic, the tea is delish, and the atmosphere is a wonderful retreat from the craziness of Shea that lies just beyond the patio.  While you wait for your drinks on a busy morning, watch the well-choreographed dance that takes place at their espresso bar; it's awesome to watch so many great drinks made and the teamwork of the staff shine through in such a small workspace.  Cheers and hats off to the staff and owners of 32 Shea - keep up the great stuff and I can't wait for my next trip home.",

Stay to get your drink and food is served to you at your table. We got the Carmel Macchiato, and Nutella Coffee, both iced. Both very creamy and yummy. For breakfast we split both the OMG Sandwich (Prosciutto, fig, honey, and mascarpone) and the Tomato and Lox( w red onion, capers, cream cheese on and everything bagel). Also both very scrumptious!!   The atmosphere was cozy and tranquil! Happy Bob Marly tunes played in the background. Friendly people and pets around. You've got to love the Buddha/Water/Succulents shrine!   Tips: Try and know your order before you step in the door. It is very small inside and the staff is very busy and running in & out.   If there are 2 of you one should order and another find a seat.   If you have a dog they are welcome on the outdoor seating area and they have a place to get water for them.   If you follow them on Facebook you can see what their daily dinner specials are!  They have happy hour from 6am-6pm plus daily specials like 20$ bruschetta & wine on Tuesdays!! Awesome!!   All in all its a must try awesome spot and your supporting local business! What's not to love?!",

As for the coke.... $1.25 for a can of coke is a little pricey.  I was expecting unlimited refills on my soda, thinking it was a fountain soda.  Lesson learned.  Ice Chai tea had the perfect blend of ingredients. Definitely not completely homemade but delicious, nevertheless.   The feta, olive, tomato, & pepperoni night bruschetta was pretty good but a little on the dry side.  We asked for a little olive oil to drizzle over it to give it that little extra pop.  Outstanding.  Salami, pesto, tomato bruschetta was a little odd.  Large slices of meat and tomatoes, like one would put on a sandwich.   Still tasted yummy but everything slide all over the place.  Would get it again. ;)  Service was outstanding.   I liked that the waiter gave suggestions and variations to the menu.  Couldn't have had a better experience.   :)",

I ordered a chicken salad with bacon, egg and avocado with a balsamic dressing. The price was less than most places charge so when it arrived I was shocked to see that it had a lot of bacon not just a few bits a large slice of avocado as well as half a boiled egg.  The patio was small but very well shaded and I look forwarded to going back and trying their dinners as well as the happy hour.",

    "text": "READ THIS FIRST:  If you are looking for a high volume, quick place to get a massive quantity of coffee, and a huge indoor space to stretch out and sit for hours using their WiFi, this is NOT the place for you.    For the past 2 years my husband and I drove past the little place at 32nd Street and Shea wanting to try it.  However, we were addicted to the green mermaid and her infinite helpings of caffeinated drinks.  We could get in and get out without much interaction from the staff or clientele.  After speaking to several people who work in the area, we decided to stop in one Saturday morning for a mini-date.  It was the best choice we've made with regards to restaurants in a very long time.    This place is small, dark and cozy, with an eclectic menu, music, vibe, and customer base.  Now, reading other reviews, we noticed that there was a common theme: people who sat themselves and waited for employees.  When you enter the establishment, there is a bar and cashier where all ordering is done.  No one will come to your table with a menu.  When we entered we were greeted immediately.  The menu is behind the bar, so we stood checking out our possibilities.  The space is small, so people patiently wait in line inside and outside.  We ordered the Mexican Burrito, the Croissant Sandwich, and the green apple and brie danish to split.  The burrito was flavorful, as was the croissant sandwich.  But the green apple and brie danish blew our socks off.  We had two drinks: the hot mocha and a cold white chocolate mocha and lavender freezachino.  Yes, I said lavender.  It is an incredibly refreshing summer drink.    We sat ourselves and waited for our food.  The restaurant was about half full with regular patrons whom the owner and staff greeted by name.  Within a half-hour it was packed. People sat both inside and on the outside patio.  When the customer migration slowed, we had a chance to talk to the owner.  We complimented her food and ambiance.  32 reminds us of some of the coffee places we stop at in San Francisco:  great food, great vibe, great people, all local.  The second time we came for lunch.  We ordered the Le Grande Tuna and the Juicy Roast Beef.  Both great sandwiches, but the roast beef is now a favorite.  It is a warm roast beef with melted Munster cheese, creamy horseradish sauce on a Ciabatta roll.  To die for!  I had the lavender white mocha again and my husband had the caramel freezachino.  So far we can say  we have not been disappointed with any of the food or drinks.  The coffee never tastes burnt!  I can't say that about other places.  They have a local roaster where they get their coffee and he does a fantastic job.  This time we sat at the bar.  There were 4 or 5 of us.  Pretty soon we were all talking to each other and the wait staff.  Human interaction?  Who knew it could be that good?  We are now regulars.  We have realized that there are limitations to the order and serving process, simply because of the size of the establishment.  Once you get past that, you will realize what a little gem this is.  32 also has a drive through.  It is nothing to see 2 cars patiently waiting for some one to run their order out.  I think the key word is PATIENCE.  If you want something quick and snappy, please don't punish this place with your bad review.  The second word to consider is LOCAL.  If you want the quick menus with prepackaged food, move on.  The food is really good and meant to be enjoyed. Why only 4 stars, we have not tasted everything on the menu nor have been there in the evening. Also, it is tiny.  I can't really fault them though for that.   When we return for an evening date and finish the menu, I will gladly switch my rating.**  So, sit down, relax and stay a while.  Order first though and be reminded that good things come to those who wait.  **Added 8/2013  Yesterday was my birthday.  With the least amount of personal detail, I shall say that I have a history for sucky birthdays. I have come to avoid them as much as possible.  For this birthday, however, we were going to start a new tradition and try make them better.  I began my day at 32.  Once again, the food was fabulous.  The honey, apple and brie danish causes me to have cravings even now.  What made me change my star count wasn't the meal itself, but what I experienced.  Barista Luke first greeted me with a big  \"Happy Birthday!\"  Apparently, my husband told him the day before and he remembered.  Then, as we were leaving the owner, Rebecca, and Barista Paul came out from behind the counter and gave me a great big birthday hug.  I was so touched. Two of my siblings failed to contact me on my birthday, but I got a group hug at 32.  These people have become my friends. They watch out for me.  The know my children. Every meal is filled with greetings, good conversation and friendly banter.  The food is great, but the people are amazing!  If that's not worth a 5th star, I don't know what does.",

    "text": "32Shea used to be a drive through coffee business.  The coffee is still yummy and the drive-in  remains open through lunch.   The kitchen and eating area inside are tiny - maybe 8 tables. The menu includes homemade baked goods, sandwiches, many on fresh ciabatta, salads, and a single entree each night... it's a tiny kitchen.  I have tasted about half the menu items, including caprese, bruchetta, different daily flatbread pizzas and haven't found one I didn't like. One unexpected aspect is a bar with an excellant selection of alcohal. My favorite is a a minted lemon drop martini. My friend enjoys a manhattan or Crown Royal.  They serve an honest pour. Outside is an enclosed patio which is dog friendly. It's a great place to relax, listen to the occasional band, or read a book. When you go in, it's easiest to order at the register. Then they bring your food to you. The staff is friendly and informed. You do have to get their attention once in a while, but it is worth it. Enjoy!",

They have a killer sandwich called the OMG that I just can't get enough of - figs, prosciutto, mascarpone and honey on perfectly chewy ciabatta. For dinner they have excellent Bruschetta as well as revolving daily specials and an excellent wine selection. This is the perfect place for a romantic dinner outside on the Patio in the cooler months.",

    "text": "I want to love 32 Shea. It is locally owned, has an awesome atmosphere, reasonable prices, and a good happy hour. I love sandwiches, coffee, and a good glass of wine- so it should be the perfect place! The reason for my two star rating is directly related to a recent experience I had with my husband and son when we went for lunch. First, we walked in to the restaurant and there was a line leading up to the cash register (normal). Initially, my husband, holding my son, stood to the left of the line. However, he was in the way of waitstaff, and had to move out of their way several times while holding a baby. No big deal- we just moved to the other side of the bar, where we would be out of the way of the waitstaff while we waited to get to the front of the line. When the line cleared up, the bartender pretty rudely told us that we needed to move to the front of the cash register in order to order because the bar was unopened. It was just kind of weird, because clearly we had just been in the line and had only moved to the side of the bar because we were in the way of the waitstaff. His attitude was just a little bit snotty and not at all understanding that we were holding a baby while trying to move out of the waitstaff's way. After we ordered, I asked if there were any highchairs. The cashier told me that they were only available outside. I get it, it is a very small space inside, but that is a total bummer when you live in a place that is over 100 for several months of the year. So, we were a little disappointed, because it was 95 and we have a one-year-old, but we went outside anyway. This is where the rating really comes in. There were three plastic IKEA highchairs, stacked sitting underneath a tree in the corner of the patio. They were filthy. I mean absolutely filthy. Caked in dirt and old food filthy. Fortunately, I had a pack of Clorox wipes with me and I got to work while my husband went to find a busser. However, even with an entire pack of wipes and the busser wiping down the highchair, it still had black dirt marks all over it and caked food. I even asked him if he would be willing to eat off of something like that, and he shamefully said, \"no.\" Husband and I were both pretty frustrated at that point but were determined to not let it ruin our day. We enjoyed our sandwiches and a glass of wine and everything ended pretty smoothly. Unfortunately, the experience just left a bitter taste in our mouths, and it will be a while before I'm ready to go back again.",

Great place for breakfast and a good cappuccino, but even better for a cocktail and a bruschetta at the cocktail hour.    They've recently renovated the patio which now has a Morrocan/bohemian feel with brightly covered umbrellas and funky brass lighting, Toss in a very dog-friendly patio and awesome custom service (they know how I like my cocktail without being reminded which tells you how often I go/embarrassing) and you can not beat it.  The prosciutto bruschetta is sublime.",

    "text": "Oh i hate to do this, (food and drink quality is still good). 32 has been my favorite spot for awhile now for coffee.  Now where do i start on my new review... I struggled between 2 or 3 stars, but i am being biased and letting them live with the 3 instead.  I haven't been to 32 in 2 weeks, and decided to stop by and get some drinks with my wife. When we get there it is all new people working there, that is a little depressing. I will reminisce that the first baristas i met here have been hands down my favorite and none have filled the shoes they left.  Back to my experience.. I have my loyalty card with one punch left. That means my wife and I only need to pay for one of our drinks! Yay! Sounds like my day is going pretty well. The next event was waiting for this girl who was just tinkering on the Ipad to get done and greet us and get our orders. We order or drinks,   and she says \"I can't give you your free drink.\"  I was just honestly confused and stunned so i didn't say anything.  girl-\"You are doing this in one purchase right?  me-\"yes....\" at this point in my head i am thinking...WHAT!?!? it has NEVER been like that..for the 3 or so years i have been coming here it has NEVER been like that...  girl-\"well you can do it in two transactions\"  me- \"yeah do that.\" ... at this point to prevent me from being over involved in this conversation i flip open my phone and wait for her to figure this all out  The girl turns to the person working on the bar and asks some question about the situation. YAY it's the manager working at the bar, finally a familiar face. She was as confused as i was about the situation.  girl- \"well i don't want to give them a double discount, a punch in the card and a free drink\"  At this point i just space out because this is the most ridiculousness i have heard. NO WHERE does that,  or acts like that...let alone in front of a customer. Granted i did not say anything else and just got my drink and left.   WOW...i just don't even want to express how sad this is for me that 32 is starting to be one of \"THOSE\" places",

Only thing redeeming the spot was the cashier with the white framed glasses, she was absolutely gorgeous. Not all heros wear capes !",

    "text": "The food was great, but I can't say the same about the service.   My boyfriend and I went with our dog. The sign said to go inside and get a hostess to seat us, so my boyfriend went inside while I waited. I guess they were too busy inside to even answer his question. The woman told him that she would be \"right\" with him, but we waited for ten minutes. I'm guessing she forgot about him even though he was standing right there, so he went up to her again and asked about being seated. When she finally got to him, she told him that we could sit wherever we'd like. It's pretty confusing for people who haven't been there before. I also agree with a previous reviewer, it would be a lot easier if they took our order at our table.  My boyfriend and I split the caprese sandwich and New Mexico burrito (minus the bacon). Really good. Their salsa was the best that I've had. I had an iced Nutella mocha and my boyfriend had a hot one. We both liked our drinks although I didn't really taste the Nutella.  All in all, it's a cool place. I will return to try different things on the menu like the \"veggie-tarian\" sandwich. The service could be better though. Maybe update that sign.",

The beer selection is limited, but if you like a good pilsner, they serve Grand Canyon which is a fairly decent brew. I paired it with the bruschetta.   Upon entering, you'll marvel at their ingenuity....getting fifteen or so tables to fit in a space smaller than a Catholic confessional. Kudos to you guys. I felt like we were all part of a human sweat-lodge experiment.  My server was friendly, and patronizing. I like that.  \"You're cute\" will get you a nice tip. I'm not cute and I know it. So did everyone else at our little table when eyebrows raised, signaling she's out of her fucking mind.   If you don't mind being pressed nuts to butts with strangers, I strongly recommend this place if for no other reason than to try their bruschetta combo plate. It's divine.  Four solid stars for someone telling me I'm cute.  If she only knew, I'm shallow too.",

That would be ok if I had been told that ahead of time. Instead I look like a doofus going back to the bar from patio retrieving coffee drinks which had been sitting there for probably 5 minutes. I must also point out the fact that we went during a slow period so there's no excuse for this lack of effort on employees part. When we left I noticed towering boxes of plastic cups and wears being stored on their back loading dock in 110 degree heat or however hot Phoenix was today. I'm sure that's not good for leaching plastic chemicals",

I went for the Early Bird Sandwich and a large cappuccino. The portion size was perfect, all of the ingredients tasted fresh, and it was priced well at $4.50. I loved the cappuccino, but next time I have to try the mocha with nutella.  Attention tea-drinkers: there is no black iced-tea, only green. My mom wanted black iced-tea, and had them make one of the premium loose-leaf black teas and pour it over ice. I'm not sure what the brand was, but the tea tasted amazing! A little expensive if you're used to standard iced black tea.  We ate on the patio with our pup. Nice ambience, you almost forget you're in the middle of a parking lot. If I lived closer, this place would become one of my regular breakfast spots.",

By day, they are a coffee shop that serves delicious food, has a full bar and some of the coolest, most fun baristas in the city.  By night, 32 Shea is the perfect place to grab a glass of wine and some amazing bruschetta, or the dinner of the day with an delicious craft beer or even a lavosh pizza and a mint lemon drop martini (holy yumminess).   The homemade green salsa and bloody mary mix are not to be missed!  **Friend 32 Shea on Facebook or follow them on Twitter to make sure you never miss out on the awesome daily deals they offer.

    "text": "Meh. If you want to skip the details, there are plenty of better places. It's more dog friendly on the patio than kid friendly because of the service. Came here for restaurant week and it was lopsided. For instance, for service we would give it a 2 to 2.5 star rating. The concept of the food we would give a 4 or 4.5 rating. Execution of that concept was 2-3 stars. The frustrating thing is with a little training of the wait staff, and a little more tasting of the food before it goes out of the kitchen and we would agree with the 4 stars. 2 starts feels a little harsh but the yelp \"Meh. I've experienced better\" was exactly how we felt.  First the food: We have the salmon salad and gorgonzola dates to begin with. The salmon was a hair salty, but that was nothing to be too worked up about. The bacon wrapped gorgonzola dates appetizer was the highlight of the evening. On to the main course. We had the nutella mole short ribs and lobster mac and cheese. The first three bites of the mac and cheese were delicious- But then... after a few more bites the richness of the plate began to weigh in, and left us wanting  some kind of vegetable, or color, or something to break up the monotony of an otherwise good dish. Lobster mac can be found in a lot of places, and this just seemed like a lazy attempt at it. Nutella mole short ribs-- The risotto that accompanied was very rich, which made the mole all the more heavy because of its richness. Nutella mole was very sweet and would have been better pared with some kind of spice-- some habanero or something to counter the sweetness. Finally the desert course. K had the mascarpone cheesecake and I had the espresso mousse. The espresso mouse was very good and well done. I'm a coffee drinker and did not think the espresso was overpowering. The cheesecake... we walked away thinking that it was store bought and not made from scratch. Still good, but not great.  Now for the service. We elected to sit on the patio with our baby since the patio is very well done and inviting. We walk past two employees, and although I am carrying a car seat and a 20 pound child, offer no help as where the front door is. Ok, no prob, that's our fault I suppose. You have to be smart enough to get inside a restaurant. We are quickly seated because we are certainly on the early side of the dinner crowd at 5:30pm. With a sleeping baby and a setting Phoenix sun, we are thankful to be sat at a 4 top table (one chair for the baby and 30 things that must accompany a baby). And then we wait. 20 minutes later the server tells us that her \"boss would kill her\" if she kept two people at 4 top table. So wait... the manager would rather we wake a sleeping baby, move the diaper bag, car seat, bottle bag, and another bag so that you can seat us at a two top??? A quick glance around the patio and we see two ladies seated at a 4 top. The patio at this time is half full. We know when we are being lied to, and our first reaction was 1) ok, we will leave and then 2) bring you manager here so they can tell us directly. We went along with it, our fault, because it being a Saturday, we were afraid that our date night would be pizza at home. Here's a tip for service industry people that don't have kids: when you see a couple out, and they have a child/children: their night out is a big deal. It takes work to get your family out into the world and that couple is probably trying to make their night out special. If they get that special night out, the chances of a better tip and/or good word of mouth about the place go through the roof. Add more challenge to that night out and you get 2 stars.   We knew the price going in, but after two glasses of wine (they didn't give us the happy hour price but we didn't know if that was restaurant week so I didn't say anything) and a Moscow mule (bartender forgot to shake it so it tasted REALLY strong at first) $110 after tip. No way that was worth it.",

I felt like I was in the middle of a trendy neighborhood district in San Francisco as opposed to the barren shopping plaza I actually parked in. My hubs and I arrived at 8:30am on Sunday morning for our monthly brunch and placed our orders also immediately. There were a handful of patrons but we managed to find a table easily. Plus, the patio outside has more tables where you can sit with your four-legged friend (bonus points!) and enjoy the weather.   We waited about 10 minutes before our food arrived. I ordered The OMG sandwich which sounded so interesting I couldn't NOT try it. It included prosciutto, marscapone and figs on a tasty ciabatta bread. I was delighted with my sandwich. Yes, I said \"delighted\" because it was that great of an experience for me. I don't even like sandwiches usually....really, ask my husband! He had the Early Bird sandwich which he said was absolutely delicious. His only complaint was that it was small on the portion size and he could have eaten two more of those things. We were both quick to point out though that we could have gone to Denny's if we wanted quantity and mass production. This place has high quality ingredients and gourmet concoctions. We will definitely be going back!   This place apparently is also great for some evening drinks so we look forward to seeing it in that type of setting too.",

There was a chance that I would have to move to Phoenix for work in the next year or so, but I've been accepted elsewhere. 32 Shea was one of those places that made me slightly regret my decision. For anyone visiting Phoenix, it's a must-eat place. For anyone who lives in the Phoenix area, shame on you for not trying it sooner.  It's not a rowdy place. It was relatively quiet and relaxing when we were there. There was a cute and charming ambiance. I'll probably be driving through Phoenix again in May and I will definitely stop by this place at least once.",

That night it was a banana shake (my boyfriend asked for chocolate added and they were able to add it!) with burger that had caramelized onions, bacon, and bleu cheese! It was amazing and cooked to perfection- also definitely two portions. We also ordered 3 of their bruschetta- the one with fig and honey was remarkably good. Finally going here at night made me love it that much more and appreciate the great patio and fun dining atmosphere that my favorite local cafe turns into after 5 pm.",

Again, we stopped to grab coffee and $20 later we are eating a breakfast burrito, pineapple coconut muffin and I'm chugging down my Nutella mocha.  The service is quick and they sure do hustle, I don't feel rushed ordering either which is nice because at some coffee joints they are so anxious to move onto the next guest.   The breakfast burrito is not anything to write home about, it does seem microwaved and the guacamole store bought, just my opinion and didn't stop me from eating it!  The muffin was delicious and coconut packed!  If I ever return to the area and happen to stumble upon 32 Shea again, I would re-order the Mocha which isn't too sweet of your worries about sugar.  Thanks 32Shea for a great experience!",

Now the unfortunate cons: 3 times my husband and I have had our dinner orders forgotten! ( yep not just 1x but 3x!) We continued to go back for the burger and shake night in hopes for a better outcome and better service but clearly that's not the case and we will never return again for dinner. Also, the servers seem overly stressed (1 waiter for the entire patio?)- not once does our water ever get refilled- even when we ask multiple times. Last thing- even after being forgotten about and sitting there waiting for over 3 hours we were not even given a discount, free dessert, nothing!! That to me is just so unfortunately horrible :(",

Even though it wasn't real busy, we had to bus our own table. The general manager, Karyn, was sitting at the bar, and after I put some of the dirty dishes next to her, she didn't offer to help with the rest. When I asked a server for something to wipe the table with, she did wipe it for us, but she commented that she would let us get away with bringing coffee with us \"this time.\"  We told her we were just finishing these up and we had ordered drinks with our lunch. The rude comment was bothersome, and I didn't like feeling like I had to explain myself.   We sat patiently for quite a while, but commented that the food was taking quite a bit longer than normal. We noticed that 3 people who ordered after us were served, so we figured ours would be out soon. Then we saw that another couple who got there well after us were served. When my husband asked, they said ours was going to be made next.  Between the long wait and the rude comment, we were frustrated, so we asked for our money back. We won't be coming back any time soon.   In looking through other comments, I see that we were not the only ones finding the service to take way too long. I hope they figure this out because the place is cute and we've always liked the food.",

I've had the iced tea, nutella mochas and blue van beer.  Yummy!  I love what they've done with the patio with the fountain and the buddha.  It's such a cool place to hang out and the indoors is nice as well.   Go check it out!!",

Drinks were weak and we didn't even like one of them and the server didn't do a check back to get a different drink. In fact ordered another drink from someone just walking by and left the full drink on the table. Literally melted as we got our tab and left. This was my 2nd time in and will not be giving them another chance.",

The wait staff is very attentive and friendly. Even though it was our first visit they made us feel like old friends.  The food is good. It is very reminiscent of Postino's before they became a chain.  My only complaint was the Nutella Cheesecake, which is something they are noted for, was very poorly presented. It was a nearly frozen slice of cheesecake plopped on a plate swimming in a watery chocolate sauce that was dumped on top. Really? Do something. Put some shaved almonds or a dab of whipped cream and drizzle the sauce on top.  They almost got 5 stars. They just need to fine tune the presentation.",

    "text": "\"Let's have coffee!\" Amanda B. said. So I got there early. I hooked myself up to super fast wi-fi. I cursed myself for having stuffed myself already as the menu looked delicious. After hugs were shared I watched enviously as Amanda returned to the table with wine. At lunch time.  Apparently Happy Hour is a twelve hour thing. TWELVE HOURS.  Did you hear me? (Dine in only. This is stipulated on the menu. Who tries to take HH to go? Apparently SOME PEOPLE. 32 Shea does have a drive thru.)  So from 6AM to 6PM folks can enjoy the following: $4 bottled craft beer $5 wine, mimosa, bloody mary $6 martinis, cocktails  AND then (!) they have a 2-hr munchie hour 4pm-6pm (again, dine in only kids) $3 bruschetta $5 munchie menu (which they put on the chalk board)  See here's the thing. If you're a writer, this place is dangerous. You'd never get a damn thing done. You'd show up bright and early for breakfast (which is served until noon), enjoy coffee, move onto a smoothie and then lunch. (The green smoothie is *excellent*.) At some point a beve would make sense, right? And then, well, it's drinking time?  This is an adorable cozy space. You will fall in love with it. Oops! I got all sorts of excited and left something out. You place your order up front at the cashier and food is brought to you. Tables are cleared for you.   I took a menu to keep in my car. YES, I did that. This place isn't in my neck of the woods. However, I cannot wait to grab food the next opportunity I'm up here again!  UPDATE: While you're here be sure to try the New Mexican burrito. The green salsa is to die for. (I'm hoping they start selling this to go soon.) Garlic, jalapenos, cilantro, tomatoes, onion, and some other heaven. I can't remember what else Rebecca, the super cool owner, described with zest. She's currently sporting purple short hair. All the employes rock. There's a punky and fun vibe going on here. Good times :)",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that their Chai Thai Latte makes Starbucks looks like they're in training...and 32Shea should be their headquarters. (That's my full star). I was on my way to the burger joint just right across when I couldn't resist stopping by for a drink, simply because I've heard nice things about this place. I gotta say, the chai tea was cool... What was not cool was a boss who thought it was ok to nearly scold her employee in front of the patrons. A dirty floor does not look worse than a humiliated employee. This woman, which I am going to assume is the owner of the establishment thought it was acceptable to 'instruct' her employee how to clean the floor but could care less to use that same passion & fervor to tend to my order. The other employees said hello, but she didn't even bother. She took my money like if it was her right. Granted it was only 2 drinks but did that mean I deserved less? I actually saw servers bringing up food and drinks to all tables, and based on that alone I thought that was the norm for all orders, but when I finally realized the drinks were not coming I just got up to find them deserted at the counter. Not a call nor anything. I get very fustrated with this kind of service, specially when I am with friends, because when it's my turn, they trust I can pick a nice spot for a nice experience but at times It's embarrassing. I am just thankful I ordered my drink cold to begin with. My friend did not complain, so there was no fuzz over there, but seriously!",

I went there last night for HH with a friend and really liked the atmosphere (5 stars!), the patio was so cozy and quaint. The wine was good and the HH food was also pretty good. I like to have choices that are healthier (caprese salad vs fried everything!).   So, for the personnel - I witnessed some pretty unprofessional behavior between, what appeared to be a manager, and a young man who was seating people and bussing tables. He was showing some ladies to a table on the patio when I noticed this manager (short dark hair) grab the menus from his hand and pull him aside and start scolding him about something - loud enough for others to hear and while leaving the ladies standing there waiting, then she leads the ladies to their table, which was right next to ours. A few minutes later this same woman came up to the ladies at the table and said something unkind about the young man. It was so unprofessional and I'm not sure how a business can have repeat business with shenanigans like this. I won't be back solely based on what I witnessed. If you're going to be in the people business, hire \"people\"people!",

The patio is the place to be--inside is a little cramped and noisy. You won't exactly be able to spread out on the patio but it's still nice and cozy. It's dog friendly, too!  Drinks are super affordable during happy hour, and the food specials are delicious. We haven't tried a bruschetta we didn't like, and the turkey sliders are delicious, too. We tend to just order small plates and drinks and hang out until the sun goes down. It's a great place to wind down on a Thursday or Friday night as a couple or in a small group. I would imagine large groups would be a challenge.  Service is overall good--they get a little frazzled sometimes but when we're there we're never in a hurry to leave. First round of drinks and apps always comes fast :).",

I've now gone twice in the last month and each time I've been pleasantly delighted. With the weather finally cooling down, their patio is nice and serene with trees and shrubs surrounding it.  For a brief moment you forget you are in parking lot. It's also nice that their patio is pet friendly as well. So on the first visit I got their OMG sandwich. Oh my was it good! It's a combination of Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Fig  and Honey. Need I say more ;) . On my second visit I got their tuna sandwich, the tuna salad was good. The only thing I wish is that they could offer another type of bread besides Ciabatta, since it seemed like the bread to tuna salad ratio was a little off. Other than that I'm a firm believer in local businesses and I hope this one continues to thrive!",

    "text": "This is a cool place.    My girlfriend and I were in the area for an appointment and had our Great Danes with us.  We were early for the appointment and hungry for breakfast so when we happened upon this place we were all about it.  The main building isn't that big but they put out some great products.  I ended up with a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich (which was very tasty) and my girlfriend had a bagel with lox, cream cheese, capers and a few other things.  She enjoyed it.  They have a decent selection of coffee and tea drinks that they make.  They also have a drive through, which is very convenient.   The patio area is dog friendly so of course we brought them over.  This is a pretty chill place and I would recommend it if you are in the area.  I will definitely be back if I am in that part of town again.",

My wife had the OMG sandwich (prosciutto, mascarpone, fig and honey) loved the blend of flavors in this one of a kind sandwich on toasted ciabatta.  The turkey, cranberry and cream cheese was also excellent.  Busy spot, busy time of day yet very quick and friendly service. A return to this fabulous little corner is in my plans.",

The idea is great, the feel is great. The execution... leaves something to be desired.   I don't even get why they have the drive thru. They don't have a speaker to give your order. So basically you have to pull up to the window to get your order in. This creates huge problems if there are a few cars in front of you. I've spent over 20 minutes in this drive thru or waiting off to the side while they prepare the food or drink.   The delay wouldn't be an issue if I were inside relaxing, but if speed isn't going to be a priority, then just skip the drive thru all together.   Long story short, visit this place over sbux as long as time isn't an issue.",

I can't wait until they start staying open later and add music to the patio so I can sit out there one of these cool nights with a glass of pinot and maybe the OMG sandwich. Definitely loving this neighborhood restaurant, even while they continually grow.",

We sat at a table that still had not been cleaned yet, by the open window. 1. No one ever came over to clean up and we had to bus it ourselves 2. we got yelled at for closing the window. We closed the window b/c the wind was blowing in. The guy actually yelled across the room to yell at us...\"ummm... could you not touch our window's?\" Really??!!! Shut-up geek.  3. $1 extra for a piece of lettuce and paper thin cucumber 4. I could have had a better sandwich and experience...well anywhere else but here.",

I always get ignored for a while when i walk in then the feeling i am irritating them by ordering . Also I have waited 30-50 minutes for a sandwich most times I've gone. I really wanted to like this place. Really hope management can get the rude too cool for school employees in check ....also I have never been compensated for waiting almost an hour for food . One guy has been very friendly though .",

I come here often for happy hour and wish there were a few bar type munchies on the menu to go with the great drinks.  So, instead I get a sandwich and I'm good for the evening - love the turkey with cranberries.  The toasted cibatta bread gives crunch and texture.  I'm glad this is my 'hood. Looking forward to when everything else nearby updates to this standard.  They also have events to promote community, look for the mommy and me, dog days, etc.    Love patronizing our local indy businesses who work this hard to make a dream come True!",

    "text": "Hooray! We finally made it here for lunch. It felt as though we were in Downtown Phoenix again due to the hip and locally owned feel. I wish there could be SO many more places like this in the neighborhood. The building is small and charming. You can certainly tell a lot of love and effort were put into making this establishment a success.  They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. Have soda's, Italian soda's, coffee, tea, beer, wine and hard liquor. It's small inside with about 6 tables and a bar with seats around it as well. Cute dog friendly patio with umbrellas outside. Multiple Veggie options available! I had the Veggie-Tarian sandwich and it was great. Seems like they have varied menu options and special dishes that change from day to day. The ingredients were fresh and quality.  32 has done amazingly with a concept that is very difficult for restaurants... To excel at ALL 3 meals, keep up variety, have a spectacular coffee bar, innovative menu, and now have a full bar as well.  There is even a drive through window!  I felt right at home and cannot wait to come back for some wine. The wine list looked extensive and varied.  Keep supporting local and get here! It's amazing. I kind of want to live in a little loft above it.",

    "text": "I really want to like this place. I've been going pretty regularly for over a year and a half. Here's what I think:  PROS:  - The quality of food and drinks is vastly superior to any other coffee place you'll find in this area. They have very a very creative coffee drink selection. - The New Mexico breakfast burrito is a revelation. The salsa that comes with it is inspired. - Every cocktail, wine and lunch/dinner item I've ever had has been great. - The was once a young guy who worked there in the morning that was sweet and wonderful and totally brightened my day.   CONS: - I get a ton of attitude from almost everyone that works there, despite the fact that I tip 20% or more every time I come. I generally feel like a burden to them. Depending on who comes to the window when I pull up, sometimes I'll just order a regular coffee because I think it will be quicker and less burdensome. - There is something about their regular coffee that  is just WAY too acidic for me. I ask for a dark roast, but it doesn't taste anything like a dark roast. It is so acidic that I often question whether someone could have actually slipped lemon juice into the coffee. - Too many times, they have not gotten my order right. They have given me the wrong muffin several times and just generally don't give me what I ask for. For example, today I ordered an americano with an inch of almond milk in it. I would never expect anyone to measure exactly, but I can tell you they put less than a tablespoon of almond milk in there and no where near an inch, leaving me with an overwhelmingly lemony, acidic americano that I'm just barely choking down now.  This place has a lot of great qualities, but ultimately, I'm tired of paying and tipping just so they can get my order wrong and treat me like a piece of trash.",

We brought our son, daughter, son-in-law, and grandbaby, and expected a pleasant, outdoor dining experience.  Instead, the service was incredibly slow, the food mediocre, and the manager failed to properly address legitimate concerns.  We arrived at 7:30 pm and didn't leave until 10pm,  because the service was so slow.   We repeatedly asked for our food.  It arrived 1 1/2 hours after we ordered!   By the time we got our food, we were all so tired and starving, we couldn't even enjoy it. When we told the manager about the delay, she accused us of being wrong about the time, and tried to blame the poor waitress, telling us she would call over the server and let her explain that she had somehow failed to tell us the kitchen was slow that night.  It was a terrible way to handle customer service and not fair to the server.   The manager  gave us a free desert and 20% off the tab.  But we would have rather had good food, served on time.  We will not return.",

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. As I understand it, they are applying for their Beer & Wine License which I think will be one of the first steps to rejuvenating this old run down corner. The intersection of 32nd St & Shea used to be such a major thoroughfare before the freeway extension of the \"SR-51\". This area is still home to a wide variety of individuals who need a fun place with great eats that's not too far away. After living in Ocean Beach San Diego for 6+ years one becomes a little picky about his or her coffee shops. I was really pleased with the service here and the quality of the coffee.

First off, they ask you to order at the counter fast casual style but make you pick up your own drinks(and somehow they expect tips). My fiances burrito was cold so she had to spend 5 mins waiting in line to ask for it to be reheated. No apology. No humility whatsoever. No more than an eye roll and a spin in the microwave her burrito came back with a \"here you go.\"  The food is not bad here not overpriced. The breakfast burrito and egg croissant are delicious. The roast beef sandwich had good flavor and a decent slick of horseradish sauce. Even worth dealing with the hipsters that think that you're lucky to be in their establishment. I would give the place at least 3 stars for the food but the awful service and holier than thou servers make me want to only grab a drive thru bite next time.",

The menu item in particular I am referring to is the OMG!  I never thought OMG would be something I would say on the regular or even adapt into my daily vocab but this sandwich could be called a \"shit sandwich\" and I would still rave about it.  So basically no matter how dumb the name is the sandwich, its glory overshadows that.  The OMG for those who don't know is \"Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Fig + Honey\" now what that does is create a flavor explosion in your mouth similar to a pinata but less violent and more delicious.  I cant speak for breakfast or dinner items yet although the \"Crispy Lavosh Pizza of the Moment\" catches my eye cause I love that its named that, I will be going back to try more items.  The only reason I gave this place 4 instead of 5 stars is the coffee was good but didn't blow me away, I blame that on people building it up too much but that OMG sandwich will either change your life or save it, get it now!",

Its nice to see smiling faces in the a.m.  I took my very touchy, food nut girlfriend there for lunch and she loved the sandwich, score!!! one!!! as she is hard to please. Mine was very fresh, tasty and the service was great.  This is a busy place, it is small with a limited menu but that menu has very good items on it.  Like home made food!   Being from small town Iowa (Go Boji) I want that warm family feel that 32 Shea gives me; along with smiles, great food and conversations with people that feel the same.  So if you like the small town warm feeling, great food and banana bread, muffins and Great coffee drinks served with smiles for a smiley a.m. Always great people to chat with from all walks of life.  Make 32 Shea your stop, support small business with Great coffee, food and yummy muffins and banana bread!!  Plus if you sit and drink coffee you will probably be talking to some very well known people without a clue to who they are.",

Just a tip... when you have specials \"moments\" that change daily, maybe limit it to one or two.

The lovely owner takes great pride in her cafe and it shows. The lovely female baristas are very polite and so are the male baristas. The seating inside can be cramped but not bad, outside seating is very nice.  I had lunch there today and my sandwich was exceptional ( roast beef).  I will try dinner after I find a nice GF.  So, if you like good espresso made the right way, Cafe 32 is it.",

The prices are a bit high, but the drive-thru is convenient - just be prepared to wait for a while for your order. The reason I gave this 2 stars is that they have been fairly consistent at messing up my orders, and the service isn't very good. (I finally decided to stop going there as of the most recent incident.) Also, as an FYI to parents, they don't have high chairs because the dining room is too small.  Update: I spoke with the manager, Rebecca, who was very professional & apologetic. She informed me they have a \"call-ahead\" option for those in a rush: 602.867.7432.   Second update: I used the call-ahead option, and my food was ready  - & correct - within 15 minutes. I have thus upgraded this review to 3 stars, perhaps more over time should this become a pattern.",

The atmosphere any time of day is warm and inviting whether it's crowded or a little on the slow side. The Nutella hot chocolate is a must...best in the valley by far. Try any one of their sandwiches, their variety of bruschetta creations, and the lobster mac and cheese. Just typing this review is making me hungry! :-)",

The   lukewarm sandwich and day old unflavored tomatoes on my salad were gross, but not as gross as their customer service. Upon walking in, we stood at the counter to order and look at the menu board, we were handed a menu and asked to sit down to review it, leading me to believe this would be more of a semi-full service restaurant. We ordered food and drink and went out to the patio. No one told us that our drinks would be ready at the counter. After a while a waitress brought out our food and we asked about our drinks. She simply said \"yeah, they are inside. You can get them at the bar.\" Who does that ??? Who says that ? Bring our drinks to us or explain that upon ordering. The staff was incompetent and the food sub par. Coffee was ok, but I wonder what my toxic plastic intake is due to the fact that they have their exposed cup storage sitting in a patio outdoors. Nope nope nope. I will be recommending that no one ever go there. This was my second attempt at this venue (not even worthy to be called a restaurant). Disappointed. Disappointing. Disrespectful.

I I used to frequent 32 Shea when it first opened, and since moving away, make an attempt to eat there at least twice whenever I am back I town. I was looking forward to a quality meal in a lovely atmosphere. The restaurant was a little empty, so I was expecting maybe a softer atmosphere, but to my surprise, the manager seemed to just talk louder at her employees. My cocktails were prepared incorrectly by the same manager who seemed more eager to close up early than to pay attention to the patrons. I was unclear as to who I should order from as people informed her she had a diner and she just ordered the others to do tasks for her, while she reminisced about drinking and talked about leaving for her new job. She infantilized her employees as though talking to small children, when some of them seemed to be older and more mature than her. The food, per usual was amazing, but the single individual who seemed more than happy to be gone and starting a new job while brushing all responsibility off onto her employees, all but ruined my meal. Next time I will stick to the outside seating area. Thank you for continuing to provide quality food!",

The bar area and decor is neat and I really liked that aspect of 32 Shea. There were some bugs flying around inside which was gross but the doors were open, not anyone's fault or anything ha. We were seated pretty quickly. Our server informed us that it was his first night serving, and I totally wouldn't have known if he didn't say anything, because he did an excellent job!  The menu looked to have some good options on it. The bruschetta caught my eye because there were so many kinds, and they're $3 each which I think is pretty reasonable because they are big. I ordered 3 and it was a good amount. I got one with tomato, mozzarella, and basil, one with Brie, apples, and honey, and one with Gorgonzola with figs. Generally they were pretty good but not great, I thought there was too much bread. My favorite was the tomato mozzarella basil one. Though the middle of the bread was completely soggy with balsamic. The Gorgonzola fig one was my least favorite, too much cheese and not enough figs, the cheese was too strong to have so much on there. The brie apple honey one was in the middle, there wasn't enough Brie, but it was pretty good and I liked it. My sister got turkey burger sliders and she did not like them very much, said they made her feel sick. We also got spinach and artichoke dip which we all liked! My mom liked her salmon salad as well. So I'm glad I tried this place, but I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be!",

I'm not saying this comment will have anything to do when race but even a staff member was very rude to me to the point that I had to point it out to management. Not to mention there were no African American employees at this time. Since making those observations , I decided to give it one more shot. This time I noticed they did hire an African American and the experience was a little better.

The outdoor patio is dog friendly which is a plus.  I am excited to go in the evening and have some wine and appetizers!  The staff is friendly and always smiling, which is nice at 7 am in the morning.   The place does get busy and you can always call and order ahead if you are in a hurry.",

    "text": "Love this place - especially their outdoor patio. It is a great spot where you feel like you're in a zen garden... When you're really near a big street!   The owners clearly spent considerable time, energy and money in decorating the whole place! Everywhere you look a thoughtful detail can be spotted. For the mindful amongst you, it's a meditative experience to roam the premises with your eyes, finding visual treats amongst the leaves, tables and windows.  As a not-coffee-snob-simpleton who prefers either an Americano or espresso free of sweeteners or creams, I enjoy the coffee here. I can't speak to drip coffee, lattes or other souped up espresso drinks, but they are available for those who enjoy some flavor and variety.   32 Shea isn't limited to just caffeination... You can fill your belly too! I've had two sandwiches here and was pleased with both - the roast beef and turkey. It's nice that it's only $1 to upgrade to a salad from chips!  Finally, the staff is very friendly, and after only 3 visits recognize me. I find that welcoming atmosphere to be a huge plus if I'm frequenting a locale!",

The menu choices are of wide variety however after a sandwich and salad I left hungry.  My partner had the butternut squash soup and shared with me and I found that to be the highlight of the lunch visit.  Plan to bus your own table and order up front inside.

Never refilled the water. After 45 minutes we finally asked about our food to be told their iPad went down and our order was never put in. As a server you should notice food not out for 45 minutes. Nothing was offered to make up for this and they just let us leave. No apologies or anything. A server forgets to put our order in then lies about it and we are out the time and leave starving.

It sort of tasted like a shrimp cocktail. Definitely different if that's what they're going for.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the outdoor patio with colorful umbrellas, plants lining the fence, and a modern Buddha rain fountain with succulents around it.

This was a hearty salad, the salmon was really flavorful and the veggies were fresh. Service has always been welcoming and I like how they have a decent variety on the menu.

Definitely my favorite place to go especially since the vibe of this place is great. All of the plants and flowers and the decor is beautiful. The patio is especially beautiful. They allow dogs on the patio which was great for me because I have two dogs that I take everywhere with me.   The reason I gave this place a 4 stars instead of five is if you get there to late they begin to run out of stuff. By late I mean 7-7:30pm. Especially if you try and order the special like the burger and shake Wednesday night or the tacos Tuesday night. They also do not serve breakfast lunch and dinner all day which is ok just not ideal.   However, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! It is a great place! Love you guys 32 Shea!",

Everything about this business exemplifies the uniqueness of a small local business which makes this little coffee shop a community treasure in my honest opinion. First of all the building is a clever architectural design tv show Dream in this sense that they somehow manage to consistently pack in the maximum use of every inch with equal amounts of substance and style. In addition to its awesome atmosphere is a fabulous menu that features gourmet all day from morning coffee  to cocktails after dinner. Even the green smoothies are delicious! I routinely order the egg white bite breakfast as it's a personal favorite but have occasionally ventured out to other menu items and always been delighted. It's a great place to study or meet up with other people. Patio umbrellas, heaters and a Buddha fountain  are in the courtyard but the dog friendly crowd and regular customers are reliably pleasant to be around. Inside the seating is tight but functional and the staff is consistently friendly, helpful and efficient.",

Went during the week and in the morning when it was slightly busy. Great service was not compromised and I was greeted with a smile and asked if I needed any  recommendations. This is how I came to have cold brew with their house made pistachio syrup which was super tasty. Not overly sweet and I'm craving this again today! So I had to write about it!  I got a vibe that a lot of regulars visit 32 Shea as I witnessed patrons sitting down and immediately being asked if they wanted \"the usual\" I like that a lot! People working on their laptops, and even doggies on the patio by the waterfall.  It is small inside, however the patio will be great in the cooler months ahead. I plan to revisit soon for an evening glass of wine.",

Update:  September 18, 2018 I stopped in for a martini before my daughters volleyball game. I sat down at 4:14 at the bar and it wasn't until 4:20 someone acknowledged me. And they were two feet from me. The girl begins the bar/coffee machine did not know how to work the espresso machine, so I do t have high hopes for my Martini. I have been coming to this restaurant for over 10 years. I was told the new keenest were going to make improvements when it was sold over a year ago. I see no changes. But I am glad to report that my martini is ok.   I have moved away from the neighborhood, but my daughter is still at the high school down the street, so I thought I would still come by. Not sure I will. I will give it one more try.  Update to my update. Same day.   I sat next to a woman at the bar who ordered the tuna melt. It used to me an opened face sandwich on toasted bread with melted cheese. This sandwich was on focaccia and the cheese was cold. She was sending it back as I left.",

They also have a drive through which is pretty neat for a local establishment that serves food that isn't fast food. I have never had their coffee or drinks here. I've only come for food and have- in the past- tried the avocado toast, breakfast sandwich, and the lox. Most recently, I had the lox. It was good but quite salty and oniony. None of the food here is bad but it's not amazing either. I don't see myself going out of my way to come here.",

I loved the atmosphere and the ambiance. the only issue I had was that when loud cars and motorcycle drove by, it completely drowned out the conversation. (That's why I have given the place 4 instead of 5 stars.)  I ordered the Nutella Espresso Martini because I love Nutella, espresso, and Irish Creme, and as promised, it was worth the wait. I also got a chop salad, which wasn't really anything to write home about, but the martini was definitely worth going for. Definitely go for the drinks, if nothing else!",

When we walked in, the place was small and very dark.  We seated ourselves, ordered waters, and looked over the menu. The waitress had a bit of a 'tude, and kept asking what drinks we wanted to order. Um, sometimes people just don't want to order a drink. Sue me. So we ordered a plate of bruschetta and the chicken salad to split. The bruschetta was so-so; not quite what I wanted. We got the salami and pesto, goat cheese and cranberry relish and feta, olive and tomato. They were a bit sparse with the toppings. The salad was actually very good, but I wish they used chunk chicken instead of sliced deli meat. Overall I will not be back. I will stick with Postino's.",

Wondering to do about dinner, we turned around and spotted 32 Shea and figured, hey, why not? We are so glad we did! We started off with three kinds of bruschetta, which were nicely balanced in terms of what you get in each bite. One was caprese, one was apples, brie and honey, and one was salami (and I don't remember what else). For dinner I got the lobster mac and cheese and my husband got the braised ribs. The mac and cheese is crazy! So much rich gooey cheese and nice chunks of lobster, incredibly luxe comfort food. The braised ribs melt in your mouth (yeah, I tried 'em, I'm not crazy!) they are so tender and perfect. My husband does not really like polenta at all, which is what came with the braised ribs, but 32 Shea has turned him into a believer and he polished his plate. We were too stuffed for dessert sadly, but you better believe we'll be back. Very friendly staff, showed up at the right moment without being too intrusive.  My only comment for the restaurant is that we were going to sit outside but the seats are pretty hard (just metal). I'd love to see them move into a bigger space somehow!",

Bruschetta is yummy and good value. Other items are okay. Menu is limited since kitchen is small and have few items. Portions are small-medium. Mildly overpriced. Breakfast is so-so.

It's simple, quaint, good service, nice atmosphere, and the price point isn't bad at all. We sit on the patio and enjoy the sunshine while we eat our O.M.G. sandwiches - to DIE FOR! Jeff is the guy behind the register most days when we go - he's awesome!  You might be surprised to learn where 32 Shea is located. It's in the parking lot of a strip mall that appears run down and deserted at the corner of 32nd Street and Shea Blvd. Prior to the 51 highway, this little section of town got quite a bit of traffic. However, since building the 51 not much traffic gets down to that corner - causing many of the businesses in the area to struggle the past 8 or so years. I'm hopeful that with the success of 32 Shea other businesses will follow suit: great service, good food and good atmosphere creates a successful business.   Can't wait to see what's in store for 32 Shea. They're doing their own marketing, creating their own vibe and successful in their efforts so far!",

It wasn't busy and there were two people ahead of us. We watched people come in and out with drinks and so I went inside and asked about our coffee order. The not to happy lady working the front counter said that the ticket didn't come out and needed to take my order again to give to the baristas. I then went back outside thinking she would have them make the drinks right away knowing that we had been waiting. Another 10 minutes go by and I see customers walking in and out with drinks. I went back inside for the third time and they were still not making our drinks and she then proceeded to tell me they were making them now. A few minutes later, still nothing. I went inside and they were continuing to make other customers drinks. It was 9:30 and we needed to leave to make our appointment on time. I told the not to lovely or caring front desk girl that we don't have time to wait for our drinks and they all just turned around and looked at me and didn't say a word. No apologies, no money back offers. Nothing. We went in there knowing we had 40 minutes to order two cappuccinos. I would not recommend this place due to poor customer service and lack of communication and respect for their customers.",

I'd seen this place change hands a million times. My brother is a True foodie and we both prefer to support mom and pops over the corporate chains. We took our dogs and were very  impressed. Between the cleanliness, upbeat atmosphere, delicious fresh ingredients and beautiful presentation, this place has it all. The happy hour specials are fantastic and well priced.  The fresh mozzarella and basil sandwich is to die for. nothing quite as heavenly as a relaxing morning with a breakfast burrito and Java concoction from 32 Shea. I've enjoyed the drive thru for delicious coffee drinks. I'm usually a Starbucks girl, but am making a concerted effort to keep the little guy in business. I gave this place a 5 star rating because for the most part it is just that. I have had some less than ideal encounters the past few times. A few of which left me not wanting to come back. For awhile my drive through orders were always inconsistent. Vastly different taste and texture than the exact same drink. (Their version of a caramel frap). I'm not big on complaining, but the third time it wasn't even close to what the owner had made. I   asked if it could be remade. This was not well received. There was no one behind me. I don't know if it was remade or not, but the second one was equally bad. I just took it and left. I always had great success with the owners and decided I'd just go if I had the time to go in.. I've gone once since that time and it was strange. On our only visit for dinner,  we were treated poorly and walked out. Being in recovery, we don't drink. This appeared to annoy our server and we were not given the good service received during lunch or breakfast visits. I'd still recommend 32 Shea based on food quality and presentation, it's just not a place I'll frequent for dinner.",

    "text": "I really liked Shea 32 under the old ownership, but after my service experience today I'm not sure I will return. I waited 20 minutes in the drive thru for coffee, which is fine I get that it can be busy, although I was a little annoyed because I had my baby with me who cried the entire time. But when I got to the window, a guy stuck his head out and said he would be right with me. I waited another 10 minutes while he delivered food and drinks to the cars in front of me who were waiting. He finally came back to the window and told me that their card machine was down and they were only accepting cash. Things happen- I get it- but why not tell me that the first time he stuck his head out? Also, if your card machine is down, you should really put a sign that says so on the drive thru sign so customers don't wait in line for 30 minutes just to find out it's cash only. I didn't have any cash on me so I took my business elsewhere as did a number of other cars behind me. Honestly 2 cups of coffee isn't worth the 30 minute wait I endured today- so I probably won't go back.",

He actually took longer to make 3 drinks than it took the kitchen to make our 2 burritos and a sandwich. Food was terribly plain. Burrito came in an awful dry tortilla. Turkey meat was excellent, but the rest of the sandwich left a lot to be desired. Lettuce and tomato contributed to making this sandwich look and feel like a McDonald's sandwich. The patio is beautiful and the inside is clean. This place could be amazing, but the coffee and kitchen need some help.",

Ive tried drive thru and i get it that it good quality food and that takes time and thats why i go there but come on i wait all day for things and i dont get crazy complex coffee drinks either i only drink ice tea i mean pour it in a cup and give it to me!  I even tried calling in a lunch order a head of time and that took the longest to get believe it or not!  So today i thought calling ahead didn't work and drive thru certainly doesn't work so why not go in and eat inside that way if i am in front of there face they wont forget me or my order but NO,  this was probably the worst service yet!  I mean do they have a bunch of stoners working there or what?!?!  So in review i must say this place is so cute and the ambiance is everything i am looking for and the food if you can get it without waiting an hour is so great!!!! Btw that ice tea i waited forever for tasted like water !!!! I don't think i will return there even though i work down the road and it has the best food in the area by far but the service is lacking big time!!! Give it a try if u got an hour or two to kill but definitely not on your lunch break or before work when you are in a pinch for time!",

What I don't love is being told it would be easier for them if I paid with a card instead of cash, and being left on hold for 15 minutes last week to order takeout. I'm kind of horrified a business THAT ACCEPTS CASH would ask me to pay with a credit card instead. And I'm equally horrified that calling at 11:10 am would result in a 15 min hold, and then when they finally got back to the phone they hung up on me because I didn't respond within a split second.  Needless to say, I ordered takeout elsewhere last Monday.   Like I said, the food is great. Love the green smoothie, the chopped salad with chicken, the house dressing, the bruschetta, I could go on and on. But I don't love the attitude =(",

They have HH 6am-6pm and a \"Munchie Hour\" 4pm-6pm. The HH includes $6 mixed drinks, $5 wine, and $4 beer/cider. The Munchie Hour menu includes a list of 8 $3 bruschetta and $5 dips or a caprese salad. The employees who work here are pretty fantastic so no complaints there.  The first time I came here I got the Stacked Turkey sandwich with a side salad and an iced Nutella Mocha that they promote as \"the only Nutella Mocha in the valley\" which isn't True. I've been to plenty of coffee shops that offer Nutella coffees in the valley. The Mocha was underwhelming. The Nutella didn't shine through at all, it just tasted like a milky Mocha. The Stacked Turkey had quite a bit of Turkey on it, the bread was delicious, and it had a horseradish Dijon spread that had a bite too it. I almost with there was a little less sauce because it overpowered it a bit. Other than that it was a fine sandwich. Nothing to write home about. The salad wasn't good. Small pile of leaves with a tasteless oil dripped on it.  I'm writing this review on my second visit. I got the Caramel Blended Freeze (they call it something similar to Starbucks' Frappuccino) and The OMG (prosciutto, mascarpone, fig, and honey sandwich) with a side tomato bisque soup. The soup is delicious, but pretty small. The Caramel Freeze was better than the Nutella Mocha, but not by much. It was still really milky and not too much flavor to it. It tasted like a milkshake made out of milk and ice with caramel drizzled in the cup. The real star of this show (besides the soup) is The OMG. This sandwich is an adventure of flavor. I literally said 'oh my god' out loud after my first bite. It's subtly sweet at first and takes you on a gentle rollercoaster ride as it turns salty in the best possible way. This sandwich is a work of art.",

My husband come often enough, and we have always  tired to give it the benefit of the doubt. But today was an experience. I personally have 15+ years of customer service so this is coming from someone who knows the business, including restaurant.  We came in today using the drive thru. We always notice every time we come in how many people are working and how unorganized it is. I don't know who is managing this place but the level of staff and the efficiency don't match up. We sat at the window almost 5 minutes before someone acknowledged us, not even a \"hey, we'll be right with you!\" Nothing.  Once we were helped it was from a girl who's face was peeling. I don't know what she had going on, but someone should have pulled her aside and kindly let her know that's a health violation and she needs to do something about it, because she's handling peoples food and beverages and my husband and I were extremely disturbed. Sun burn? Ok, put some aloe on it, but Myself or other customers don't need someone with dead skin dangling off their face handing our food/beverages. Uncomfortable conversation, yes. But managers need to step it up, your running a restaurant. Take care of the personal hygiene. Once we ordered we pulled forward like normal and waited, someone else brought our food to the car and as we pulled away we realized our order was wrong. So we come back in and I explain what we had asked for and our order was quickly fixed.  Once I got back to the car I open up my container of food and there is a black hair in my salad. I was given a free lunch coupon, but honestly My husband and I are so grossed out, we won't be eating here again.  Here is where I'm at... Poor customer service, poorly managed, inefficiency, health violation/hygiene.  We have given this place so many chances, but this was it for me. No more. Good luck!",

The restaurant is a breakfast and lunch spot and it still has a drive-through option for coffee. You order at the counter and the food is quick and tasty.

Jennifer (hostess) was super helpful & tolerant of a rookie patron(myself)  who acted as if I've never eaten it before, I just like to get input from those that work there for ideas & suggestions on my order (When in Rome...). Jennifer is pleasant & very helpful. I ordered a Cappuccino & the New Mexico burrito, both very good.  The ONLY \"negative\" is price/ amount of food, it's a little costly for such a small burrito. This is just how the world is now  but the quality of the food, flavor & coffee are EXCELLENT.",

Since it's summer we definitely didn't want to brave sitting outside so we snagged a table inside. Inside is cute but it is a little cramped since it's a small space. I'm excited to return when the weather is cooler to check out the amazing looking patio.   Everyone working was sooo friendly, nice and helpful. Great service and really makes you feel welcome. Wednesday's are burger and shake night, so if you are in on a Wednesday be sure to ask them what the special is!  Happy hour is from 4-6pm so we actually ended up ordering off the HH menu. I got the turkey burger sliders and my girlfriend got the roast beef sliders. The HH version comes with 2 sliders each. The turkey burgers come with a side of chips and the roast beef comes with au jus. They were each around 5 dollars. The dinner versions come with 4 sliders each and chips and are about double the price. What a deal!  The turkey sliders were topped with mayo, Brie, bacon and apple. The flavor was awesome.. I was quite surprised by how much I loved them! The portion size was great too and I can eat a lot.   The roast beef sliders come topped with horseradish and cheese. They were also tasty and a good size.   Overall this is a cute spot to grab a drink, stop for happy hour or come in for a meal. I definitely want to be back to try their breakfast (looks like they have a good coffee operation too- they even have a drive thru in the morning!) and check out the patio on a cooler day.",

With the exception of 1-or 2 employees the rest of the staff present themselves as very unfriendly and give the impression they do not want to be there. They  never have a smile on their face. They don't say thank you. I've asked questions about the menu items and was made to feel rushed and like I was bothering them. My last visit was by far the worst. I ordered an iced coffee and when I got it I realized there was a lot of milk in it. I went to the counter to ask what kind of milk they used and I was told unless I specified other wise they use whole milk. I appologized and explained I was lactose intolerant and it didn't occur to me at the time to ask about an alternative. I was rudely told well most people tell us I again apologized and assured them I was not blaming them in any way. To make a long story short the manager refused to make me a new drink unless I paid for a second drink. I find this TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. We are talking about a $4 drink that's the customers cost. It cost the restaurant significantly less. I can't believe that they are so petty and desperate for a few bucks that they are willing to lose repeat business and recommendations and future potential business just for a few bucks. When I conveyed this to the manager I was told that was the owners policy. Very sad because I wad looking forward to many more visits at this establishment and would have definitely recommended them to all my friends and coworkers. Very disappointing. Shame on you. Very unprofessional.",

    "text": "Great coffee until today.  My iced vanilla latte didn't taste like the usual, it tasted as though it was just soy milk.   I called later to order another one and rather than just apologizing and giving me a new one, the drive-thru employee had to point out the color of the coffee vs. soy milk in another cup.  Then he proceeded to tell me I should be ordering more than 2 shots of espresso.  I don't think so!  It's the same coffee I order every single time. I'm supportive of small business', however, this will be my last visit.   The owner for some reason has always been rude to me and her rudeness escalates when the cafe is busy.  I've tried to look past it all since the cafe does serve a good latte.   I stopped in one day to inquire about a gift certificate for our school auction in return for FREE advertising to over 300 people.  A simple kind \"no\" would have been sufficient.",

    "text": "I love locals.  I love anyone who will go through the trouble, and hard work, to open a place of business.  Let me tell you, seeing the condition of this building when my wife and I first moved into the neighborhood; the owners wanted to REALLY open this place because they had to put A LOT of work into it.  But, no surprise, it has paid off.  First off, I am more of a tea (Chai, yum!) than a coffee person, so I can't speak to the taste of their coffee drinks, but they smell fantastic!  My hot chai from here, is ALWAYS great.  Always hot, without being too hot, and has a consistent flavor each time.    The food (sandwiches, salads, and coming soon, soups) always look and smell very fresh.  I have had the:  Early Bird (Egg, Tomato, Avocado and Mayo on English muffin (with your choice of bacon or turkey)  New Mexico Burrito (Egg, Potatoes, Cheese, Avocado, Bacon) and a side of homemade Green Salsa (not a lot of heat, which I like, but still very taste),  Stacked Turkey (Tomato, Lettuce, Avocado, Provolone, Mustard+Mayo)  I would recommend all three, and will recommend other foods too, as soon as I tear myself away from the above. :)  I am looking forward to when they get to have beer/wine dinner events, and I don't want to forget to mention the retro Pepsi (in glass bottles!).  Please visit this place, you will enjoy the pleasant interior, or gorgeous outdoor seating and the very reasonable prices too!",

    "text": "I was very excited to discover this new coffee shop last Saturday!  A friend had suggested meeting there, and I mistakenly assumed it would be nested into the strip mall (in typical Phoenix fashion).  Instead, I was surprised to find this stand-alone structure in the parking lot of the NW corner of 32nd St. and Shea.    You can tell just by pulling up that this place is cool:  contemporary and fun signage, an intimate little patio, and bowls of water set out for dogs to enjoy.  Further indoor signals of this place's cool factor and unique character:  coffee drinks with Nutella (file that under \"why didn't I think of that??\"), a fantastic music playlist that reminded me of the Garden State soundtrack, day-old scones discounted to 50-cents each (love how unpretentious that felt), and boxes of matzoh displayed on top of the espresso machine (when I inquired about what they use the matzoh with, she explained that it was Passover so she thought her Jewish customers might enjoy the matzoh options for sandwiches -- so fun and sweet!).  My iced coffee was fantastic, and I definitely intend to come back and explore their \"Wichcraft,\" AKA, Sandwich, menu.  The description of the OMG sandwich will be enough to get me to come back -- fig, marscapone and prosciutto!  Overall, this independent little shop has potential written all over it, and I can't wait to increase my cool factor by adding it into my portfolio.  Watch out, Luci's Marketplace -- you have some new competition!",

My 'large' tea was more like what a Medium would be over at Coffee Bean. My husband said the same about his Pistachio-Mocha Latte. I thought his latte tasted like... milk. He loved it though because he thinks flavored lattes are usually sickeningly sweet.   My Tropical Green Tea tasted pretty good (best ever is Cartel Coffee's tea), I just wish I had ordered two of them (basically- I wish the sizes were more generous, as prices are right in line with Coffee Bean.)   I WILL be back though- this place has such a cool vibe. Overall I am certain it's worth a second trip, I just hope it blows my hair back next time.",

    "text": "Who knew this small, almost overlooked little building had potential to grow up and become so sophisticated? The owner really did a wonderful job transforming this place - I went to high school right down the street and remember not stopping into the place it was previously because it made me feel so claustrophobic. This is a perfect example of making the best use of a small space. It's beautiful, modern, and surprisingly bigger than expected inside.  My boyfriend and I are regulars here - and even though we've moved out of the area we still make the drive up as frequently as the price of gasoline will allow us. Last time I stopped in, the barista greeted me like I was his sister who just came back from a year abroad - never have I felt so welcomed to a place. He showered me with compliments and expressed genuine happiness and gratitude for stopping in knowing that I no longer live near by.  In addition to great staff, the food/drinks are DELICIOUS. I'll just list off my favorites:  - open face grilled cheese (hot, open face caprese sandwich) - 3 diff types of bruschetta: brie + apple + honey                                                  tomato + basil + balsamic glaze                                                  gorgonzola + banana peppers + sun dried tomato - nutella cheesecake for dessert (and I don't even like cheesecake) - Shea Breeze (cocktail) - Iced chai w/ almond milk (their chai is very unique - so good)  Bonuses: Wednesdays are $20 for a bottle of wine + bruschetta, and sometimes they do \"Free Nutella Fridays\" where you can add Nutella to any drink for free. Also, if you \"like\" them on Facebook they post their daily dinner menu - they have a solid menu but they feature a new dinner entree every day. Including a veggie option as well. If you like to be involved with places and keep track of specials I'd highly recommend that!  32 Shea is BY FAR my favorite restaurant/coffee shop in North Phoenix. Truly a gem to the area that lacks a lot of independent/local options.",

    "text": "10/2 update - My husband and I went here for dinner a couple weeks ago.  The food and wine were fantastic and a great value.  We ate inside - what a cozy, friendly atmosphere, and the service was superb.  It felt like family but without all the annoying family members.   Also on our way in, we noticed the misters on the patio so maybe we were too dumb and/or oblivious to notice them on our previous visit.  All in all, a yummy, romantic, fun dinner so I've upgraded it a star.  We will be back!  Btw if you like serious food porn and occasionally Facebook only specials, like them on Facebook.    ********************************** We enjoyed brunch here today and would give this more stars if the service had been better.  The food and drinks were great.  I had the yogurt and granola which was yummy.  My husband had the breakfast croissant which he said was good.  We topped it off with mimosas and a cappuccino.  Prices are reasonable.    The place is as everyone else has described - totally unexpected cute, cozy place in a rundown shopping center.  We had our dogs so sat on the patio which is nice and makes you feel you aren't next to a busy intersection but really needs misters.  One guy at the counter was great though harried.  He was efficient, very enthusiastic and nice, even bringing treats for our dogs.  The girl - not so much.  She wasn't friendly, was way in the weeds in terms of service, and for some reason, felt it appropriate to yell at the nice guy in front of all the customers.  Apparently there was some separation of duties that he wasn't respecting, but it was clear she was in the weeds badly and needed help.    We were really happy to support a local business and will go here again.  They do need to address the service issues as several reviewers have pointed out.  The drive-thru was constantly busy while we were there, and there was a good crowd inside.  We were the only ones on the patio.  They need to find a balance between serving the drive-thru and inside customers.  I cannot imagine how they could've handled it if the patio and inside were full in addition to the drive-thru.  One last thing - I think they could turn the music volume down just a touch.  All in all, we enjoyed our visit and will definitely be back!",

Quite frankly, this place seems a little out of place because the shopping center in which it is located is quite worn. In that sense, 32 Shea is like an oasis in the desert.  The owner was training 2 new people that day. So, things were a little slow. However, I was impressed with how they handled the lunch rush. They communicated well about the expectations, but I did not hear any excuses even when someone's order was incorrect (girl's 1st day). Still, they resolved the issue, and the guest seemed pleased with the resolve.",

Everything I've tried has been phenomenal. Our service has always been excellent, very attentive and good at making recommendations. The vibe of the place is great and the patio is quite happening.  My only critique is that it is so tiny, but I guess that adds to the cozy feel. And to be fair, I've never had to wait for a table.  I want to try everything on the menu. I can't say that about a lot of places. If I had the money, I'd definitely be a regular at this place.  P.S. They make a mocha with Nutella in it. I haven't tried it yet, but I find myself pondering its glory often.",

Honestly everyone I have encountered for the most part is really cool and efficient. The owner is great too and always remembers Brian and I. We would bring my boyfriends cousins dog with us all the time to 32 Shea when we would dog sit. They have water bowls and treats for dogs. It's a great atmosphere and I miss living so close to here!

Thought it was funny after 8 months she recalled my bad review even called it entertaining. And paid our bill for dinner and added 10 straws. Guess she misses us!!!!!   Thanks for the dinner Rebecca.   until today I would of given this place 3 to 4 stars, I liked that it was a local business. My husband and I went to this spot once a week for almost a year now, even made this the place to go to start my 40th birthday. despite having to send my food back once and getting the wrong drink once or twice I came back and chalked that up to basic mistakes.  Today the owner came out of left field on me using 2 straws and that it was costing her a lot of money and as a business owner I should respect her and only use 1 straw. my hubby even joked ok we will go to Dunkin Donuts then and she said you should. At first I thought she was kidding, but she wasnt.   Really you would rather loose 2 loyal customers who come to you and have recommended you to others over 2 extra straws per week? if that hits your bottom line..   I am totally schocked at this and will NEVER go back now.   Too bad Iove supporting local companies and such but apparently you would rather have the 2 cents than the 20 to 40 we spend there a week plus tipping your staff.",

Walking in you see what you'd expect from any city coffee shop, busy baristas but don't let it fool you they were very kind and helpful and always had a smile on their face. That emotion is then expressed in their coffee. I had their nutella mocha. Personally I don't care for nutella but I had heard great things about it and it did have a distinct taste without obstructing from the coffee so it was a great wake-up for my hike at Piestewa that followed. Their food is great and their back patio area is wonderful. A great tranquil spot to meet at all day with the perfect amount of shade in this Arizona heat. Loved it.",

I went in the morning and had the nutella mocha....now, I don't even really like mochas that much, but this was a completely different story. It wasn't too sweet, but it was sweet, and it had that nutty and delicious Nutella flavor.....oh my. Thank god I don't live near here or I would be spending a lot of money and calories on this delicious drink. Anyway, I came back for lunch (but they were still serving breakfast). I got their New Mexican breakfast burrito and it was alright, but not as good as many say. I really like the green chili sauce that came with the burrito, but the burrito itself was pretty generic. Anyway, I would like to come back and try their lunch or dinner food and I will definitely be back for a nutella mocha (but not too soon!).",

    "text": "Went here for brunch for the first time on 7/26. There were 6 of us. When we arrived at 10am, there was only one other table seated. We all ordered - my husband and I both ordered the breakfast burrito without bacon as we are both vegetarian. Time passed and everyone received their food except us. Our friends wanted to wait, but after about 10 mins we insisted they eat, as their food was getting cold. Another table seated 10 mins after we arrived also ordered two burritos, and received their food while we were still waiting. We asked the server multiple times and were told they were on the way. We think maybe they got ours by mistake. 50 minutes later (after the other table had eaten and left a while ago) our meal was finally delivered. At that point, everyone else at the table had finished their meals. My husband and I are both vegetarians - he took a bite and got a mouthful of bacon. We sent them back and then had to wait another 15 minutes for our meal and ended up getting them to go. All in all, we waited for a total of 65 minutes for 2 burritos with eggs and potatoes.  We were really hungry at that point, but neither of us liked the burritos, finding them bland. At no time were we offered any compensation for the error and only received one rushed apology - the server said the kitchen was really busy (but as we were the second table there after a 2-top,  our order should have gone in before the rush). As a former server, I was appalled at the lack of customer service and empathy when, not only did we wait a ridiculous amount of time for a simple dish, but the dish was not made correctly and violated our diet. Thank goodness it was not something more serious like a food allergy. I understand that things happen and would have given them 2 stars (they have great coffee) but no one working there seemed to really care. Needless to say, we will not be returning to 32 Shea.",

It's nice inside but a bit cramped. A loooong time ago it used to be a coffee shack that I used to go to before I went to high school down the street. Definitely a nostalgic area!   We started out with the bruschetta and some wine. Wine was decent and the bruschetta was awesome. I was a bit disappointed with the portion of the bruschetta though. I'm used to Postinos board of bruschetta with the same price but twice as big. Barely enough for 2 people to share.  We both ordered the entree of the moment which was a shrimp pasta dish, sans shrimp for me. It was delicious. The sauce was so creamy and garlicky. The portion was perfect. However the price isn't listed on the menu and I didn't think to ask. It was a little pricey for a cafe type of environment.   Service was warm and friendly. They were great with my dog which always wins brownie points for me. The food did take a very long time to come out though. The bruschetta took about 40 minutes, entree about an hour. Long time for a weeknight.   Overall we had a great time. I can't wait to come back and have a leisurely brunch with my hubby and pooch. The breakfast items look amazing (reasonably priced too!) and they have mimosas!",

    "text": "I really liked 32 Shea! Kinda wish there was a place like this in my neighborhood. It's a really cute place in a pretty random location - smackdab in the middle of the parking lot of a strip mall (it used to be a drive through coffee shop). They've remade it into a cool, hip little spot and managed to fit quite a lot into a small space. There's an outdoor patio that they've surrounded with trees, which, once the weather cools off, will give the outside area a little more ambiance. Inside, there is a small bar and maybe eight 2 top tables (not the type of place to take large groups). Luckily we were able to get a table right away.   32 Shea serves breakfast, lunch, drinks, and coffee (they have a drivethrough). I heard the coffee is excellent. We went there for happy hour and I ordered the Mint Lemon Drop Martini which might be one of my favorite drinks around! Very fresh and lemony. I also had the Shea Breeze (muddled pineapple, vodka, cranberry, soda, and lime). It was good, but I had already fallen for that lemon martini. My boyfriend enjoyed a couple of their local beers.   We also had a few bruschettas: the salami/pesto/tomato, the proscuitto/marscarpone/figs/honey, and the mozzarella/tomato/basil. I'd say they're on par with the likes of postino's and I'd definitely order all three again. We also really enjoyed the roast beef sliders. A little horseradish and some good au jus.",

It's intimate with a punch of coolness and although not an unfamiliar concept, they definitely deliver it in their own unique style. Great menu, various drink options, dog friendly, great staff and a drive up window....I like it. I like it a lot.   Will return- Most def!",

A  friend invited me to join them for a cup of joe, stating \"you have to try 32 Shea, they have the best coffee ever!!\"    I'm glad to say I found it and I've been back a couple of times since.  I'm not a fan of how they are set up with the order counter right at the front door, so when a lot of people are wanting a caffeinated beverage they have to squeeze in or wait outside.    The place is nicely decorated in everything IKEA, if you like that their stuff.  The service is OK, a bit stretched a times and could use more help to handle the rushes but they are very friendly bunch of baristas.  The coffee is A-OK.  Better than at most \"chain type\" of places but not at the 4 or 5 star level.",

    "text": "REVIEW UPDATE:  Ok, I've been here many, many times since I first wrote my review, and the place just gets better and better.  Dinner is now regularly served, the outdoor patio is open, and the Baristas and Bartenders have clearly hit their stride.  Let us hope that Barista Jeff and Bartender Josh continue to rule the beans and the booze for many years to come.  These fellas are seriously at the top of their game, and extraordinarily personable.  I originally complained a bit about my lattes being a tad too \"wet\" with milk, but those concerns have completely evaporated.   In fact, all coffee drinks (save one) are downright splendid, and I really appreciate the uniformity of quality I get from one day to the next.  The one and only coffee drink that lies south of perfection for me is the frozen/blended mocha-ish one.   I taste some granulation in there.  Its not unpleasant at all, but detracts from the smooth \"blendiness\" that one hopes to experience when buying a drink to stave off the imperial Phoenix summer sunshine.  The place continues to avoid pretentiousness, trendiness, kitsch and gimmicks,  and that \"institutional confidence\" in their atmosphere and product is reflected in both their staff and service.  Now THAT is rare, and worth a trip from wherever you may be in the Valley!  The prosciutto-fig-marscapone sandwich?  Yeah, that's really good.  Where's the button for 6 stars for that?",

I asked for one since it was hot and sunny and was told the one for that table is broken and they don't have any more. We brought our two dogs to the dog friendly patio and when we asked for a bowl of water for the dogs we were told there is a charge of 25 cents! How horrible is that to have a dog friendly patio and not even give them water! We were ordering two meals and two beverages so we were put off by that charge of 25 cents. Also, they just give you a paper bowl and you have to fill the water yourself. The sandwich comes with chips and if you want the soup upgrade it cost $2 extra. When the food came out we couldn't believe how tiny that soup is. Don't bother spending the extra $2. You have to clear your own dirty dishes and trash. The place just does not seem like it is run that well. Our sandwiches were mediocre and small portions. No pickle on the side of the sandwich and no garnish. It said sandwiches come on a \"toasted ciabatta\" which neither of ours were toasted and I would call it more of a hamburger bun rather than a ciabatta. I don't see what the hype is about and we both agreed we wouldn't bother going back.",

I found it randomly by searching \"coffee shops\" on my Maps apps and was very intrigued by the decor and vibe I was seeing. It definitely lived up to my expectations! I wanted a place that both my date and I could enjoy so I liked that they offered coffee/tea AND beer! Haha. Just in case I needed to switch from coffee if ya know what I mean ;) ... just kidding ... The place is in a random location, but quaint and cute and they've done well at making it seem zen and not like you're in the middle of some random plaza and on a major street. It's very small inside but cozy. The patio is great, so pretty visually and birds all around chirpy and happy.   Pricing was very reasonable IMO and although I'm not much into (or know about) coffee I enjoyed mine! I didn't try the food and haven't been in the evening so I'm definitely looking forward to exploring this unique find a little more.  Great vibes all around!

The best part about their muffins is they make them fresh and do not carry the regular Flavors you see everywhere else. I tried their Pineapple Coconut muffin. Wow!  Fantastic!    The only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars would be because, although the service is friendly, it is just so slow. Each time I have been here I was not anxious nor in a hurry to be some place.

I don't like to eat much first thing in the morning so I order a $5 item which fills me up. My husband who is just shy of six and a half feet tall orders two items ($10 total) unless he is just wanting a snack. I can't stand when places are expensive just to be expensive and could easily give you 2/3 of the food at 2/3 of the cost and be reasonable, this place solves that problem for me.   They also have alcohol for any time of day... that makes me sound like an alcoholic, but I'm sure you can understand what I mean. If you want a morning cocktail, they have mimosas and bloodys (though you'd seriously injure a vamp with your garlic breath after their bloodys). Lunch rolls around and you want a glass of wine, they've got you covered. Don't feel like cooking dinner and want to let loose with a cocktail, they've got a ton of options.   For about a month, I had an obsession with caprese salads (I still do, but it has lessened) and theirs is only $6 so I'd get a caprese with a sauv blanc for lunch or go through the drive thru on my way home from work which is surprisingly quick. They have so many options that are very affordable. I definitely recommend it!",

The staff wasn't very welcoming though. One girl literally just stared at us as we entered the restaurant and waited for us to order. Not the greatest position to be in when it's busy and you have a line behind you (especially when it's you're first time here). One guy seemed very optimistic working though. Anyhow, I wasn't overall amazed. If I find myself in the area...I will try this place again and update this review. Perhaps it's the breakfast, alcohol, or mimosas that they are known for.",

    "text": "I'm really disappointed to leave a negative review. I have been a regular at 32 Shea for almost 4 years. I fell in love with it when I came here for lunch, and decided to come back for breakfast and coffee. Their coffee is amazing and their food is really good, for good prices.   However, the experience and service is extremely inconsistent. I ordered breakfast this morning and waited 45 minutes for it. 3 other couples that ordered after I did; they received their food, ate it, and left before I even had a chance to ask them where my order went.   When it was brought to my table, it was placed in front of me with no, \"sorry about the wait,\" or explanation as to what happened.   I know you are a small, local business trying to make it work. Consistency is what builds a brand and builds success - I think you need some help standardizing the expectations for your employees to ensure guests receive the same, great experience time and time again.   I invite you to visit 32 Shea for great food and even better drinks, but it'll be hit or miss on timing and guest service.",

    "text": "32 Shea is a hidden gem located in the heart of Phoenix. Located at 32nd Street & Shea Blvd I've been coming to this cute little joint for a few years now! It's seriously the cutest cafe with an urban/hip feel. It's quite the oasis! I love their zen garden and outdoor patio they have! Super cute and cozy!! Their menu offers breakfast + lunch + dinner, happy hour, coffees/teas, cocktails, beers, wine, etc.   Breakfast  On my days off I enjoy coming here for breakfast instead of the usual ihop, Waffle House, or The Good Egg. Their mimosas are delicious and I enjoy getting their Early Bird Sandwich which comes on an English muffin with a perfectly cooked egg, tomato, avocado, mayo and you get to pick your meat! I have a sweet tooth so I also enjoy getting the Yummy in my tummy which is Nutella on a toasted bread with some sliced bananas. Also super tasty with strawberries too! Yummy!! I also LOVE their Nutella iced Mocha which I get most of the time or if I'm on a coffee run!   Lunch The OMG sandwich is one of my faves!! Comes with prosciutto, mascarpone cheese, figs, and honey. So yummy!! Their chicken raspberry salad is also a super popular menu option. The Granny Smith apples and vinaigrette ties it all together.   Dinner I absolutely love doing the bruschetta. You can pick 3 out of the few ones they have. I usually will do that for an appetizer and for my main course The Lobster Mac & Cheese or the open faced grilled cheese! They're both super simple dishes, but they add their little touch of flavor to make it even that more amazing!! Very indulging!  Desserts I've had their Nutella cheesecake once and it's TO DIE For! It has mascarpone cheese filling with a Nutella topping and almond crust!   Yes, they're a super small cafe, yes sometimes it takes a while to get food so this isn't the place to go if you're in a hurry! This is perfect for date night or brunch with the girls. Take advantage of the patio before it gets hot out and enjoy the ambience and AZ sunshine!!",

Service is great, I do wish I have had more of a personal experience and I didn't feel just like another customer but the staff was nice and helped explain the menu if needed. Just prefer not to see drama between the employees or just an inconvenience.   Note. Go during cooler months so you can sit on the patio.",

The patio area is decorated nice with a relaxed atmosphere. They have heaters, a small water feature, nice greenery and plants, and a cool statue head.   Inside seating is small but fun mom-and-pop vibe of a good coffee bar.   Drive thru is also available.   Order at the bar then take a seat. After 4pm it's apparently more of a restaurant style where they serve you.   Definitely a cool spot to check out.",

I'd give this a 4 stars if the food was a little better. We had the yummy yummy, croissant sandwich, NM burrito and an egg Sammy. All were good, but lack a ton of flavor. The eggs were really thick and pretty bland. Reminded me of sheet tray eggs from a buffet. There was also not a lot of bacon in the sandwiches. We will be back, but most likely just for drinks and a pastry. Cool coffeehouse!",

Its too bad that we wont get to experience their services because of the owner.  The owner may know how to light up an open sign, hire great employees, and set a great atmosphere... but she lacks class and needs to know what customer service stands for.  Im all about supporting small business and local businesses at that... but I will not support a classless piece of trash.  We were regulars there bringing in friends family and referring this place to anyone we could.  I will never go there again and dont think it is appropriate to treat customers the way she did us.  Not only did she eavesdrop on our quiet conversation, but then she butts in to tell us that we are being rude talking about how we disagree about her not advertising that only the 1st bottle is half off wine night but fails to tell us until after we have ordered 2 bottles.  Common courtesy would have been to tell us that the 2nd bottle is only $5  off when we ordered the 2nd bottle.... not wait til we question later and she wants to point to the menu stating the fine print says otherwise.  Im sorry, but i didnt look at a menu to look for the fine print when i see your Half off bottle wine night posted all over facebook.  But besides the fact,  after the disagreement, she proceeds to tell us that if we dont like it, we can leave.  Fair enough.....  let us finish our wine we bought and we will never be back.  She then threatens to call the cops if we dont leave that moment.  Unnecessary!  we werent causing a scene.  She made the scene on her own.  I will take my group of 7 that visits there 2-3 times a week and support another business.   In an economy like today, a business owner like herself should really take a step back and see where she will be if she continues to treat loyal customers and/or new customers like she did us.  I work with small business owners on a daily basis,,, and they arent successful by treating their customers rudely.  She should take this feedback as a gift.",

It definitely stands out though, with it's vibrant colors and proximity to 32nd Street. It has a quaint patio, although you do get a bit of street noise.   So... I met my associate and to my delight, they also had a full bar (including a great selection of vino). I think the coffee / bar concept is a great and unique one - definitely worth a visit.  The staff and owners were very friendly too.  Not sure about the food - only because I didn't order any.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this spot has a lovely, tree-lined outside patio and delicious food. So why the low rating? Service. We have family who live nearby and visit several times a year, so when we first discovered this place nearly three years ago, everything was fantastic. We felt lucky to find such a great spot. During the last year, year and a half, though, the service has gotten slower and slower and slower. About a year and a half ago, it took 1.5 hours for us to get two glasses of wine, some turkey burger sliders and a mac and cheese. So we didn't go back for a few months. Then we tried it again because as I've said, we love the location, atmosphere, libations and food. This time it was a two-hour wait for simple dishes on a weeknight. So we waited a few more months and went back and, again, a two-hour wait. After a few more months, we tried it again on a recent Wednesday around 6 p.m. and after half an hour of waiting for a server, we left. As we were pulling our car out of the lot, we saw the couple that had been sitting next to us that had sat down a few minutes after we did also walking to their car.   I would be much more forgiving if this were a one-time problem due to unexpectedly large amounts of diners and not enough servers. But this half an hour (at least) wait to get a server to your table and two-hour long dining experience is nothing new.   To Management: You've got a gem of a restaurant here. All you need to do is hire an extra wait person or two and this problem will be fixed. Unfortunately, you've lost us as there are lots of other great places nearby. I hope you don't lose even more customers.",

Not the type where you feel like you have to dress nice and act perfect, but the type where you feel like you're the boss of a big business and you're meeting with a similar successful colleague.

Often times I tell them what I am in the mood for, often times I let them know I love Nutella, and they give me suggestions. They also will make just about anything on the menu and mix it up for ya! This past time they mixed up a mocha freezeacino with nutella. Pretty darn good, tasted less watered down than sbux.  I have gotten a S'mores coffee (not that great) but you know what? Its the thought that counts, what other coffee shop has a drive thru, local bakery items, friendly and helpful baristas that dont rush you in ordering, and unique drink ideas? HMM 32 Shea does.   Come here, check out the variety, and the local flavors. You wont be upset that you did.  Located over on the Northwest Plaza on Shea and 32nd just past the 51 freeway. Go there. Tomorrow morning..",

The servers are superior for a small joint, and the wait can be longer than most places in the area but well worth the time. The owner, Rebecca, gives extra care to her business and customers. 32 Shea is always on our radar when we are looking for quality local food and bar! The music and neighborhood patrons add an irreplaceable touch! AND we can bring our dog to the patio!!",

    "text": "We always have incredible food and great service here!  Restaurant week was no different - it was excellent.  So good, in fact, I went back a second time.  The first time, I had the Gorgonzola stuffed dates and the Nutella mole braised short ribs on marscapone risotto.  They were both superb.  Very rich and flavorful!  I asked the owner to add the dates to the regular menu!  The ribs were cooked to perfection.  I was stuffed before dessert even came out.  There was a mistake and they brought the Affagado instead of the cheesecake.  Best mistake ever!  I didn't do the drink pairing only because the grapefruit martini (BEST cocktail in town) was not part of the pairing.  I had to be rolled out I was so full (and I'm not a petite guy).  I went back two nights later and had the same dishes because they were so good! Except this time I had the cheesecake, which was great.    I'm always amazed at what they are able to produce in this little place given how tiny their kitchen is.  The small neighborhood feel and ambiance tops it off.    Overall, the best restaurant week experience I had this year (and we went out every night)!!!",

The other night we came in, got our wine and enjoyed the beautiful scenery and relaxing music; we lost track of time and ordered another drink several minutes after they closed. The servers didn't even hesitate and gave us another glass even though they were about to close. I'd have to say there sincerity and kindness was much appreciated and we will continue to come and enjoy theM and YOU should tooo!!!!!",

I can sip on my delicious iced almond milk dirty chai outside in the tranquil little garden they have which is shaded by trees and umbrellas while I read a book or catch up with some friends. I wish I remembered the name of the guy at the front taking orders and making drinks, he's funny and makes pretty damn good drinks. By the way the food is delicious. I got the vegetarian sandwhich so I can't say much for the other stuff but mine was pretty great. And if I want to come back later in the evening with my friends and have a couple drinks and some dinner it's a great spot for that as well.   So overall, great service and good people!",

A great spot to go on a beautiful AZ spring or fall night.   I've been there both during lunch and dinner. They have signature sandwiches and salads to chose from, I like their caprese sandwich. Super yummy! It's a nice spot that offers some healthier options and good ingredients.   I would recommend coming here during their happy hour and sit to have a glass of wine and some artichoke dip on their patio! Perfection. Their staff is always incredibly friendly and accommodating.   Another great thing about their patio is that it's pet friendly. They even have hooks for leashes and water bowls on hand for your pups. It's locally owned and I love when you can feel the warmth and dedication in a spot and 32 Shea exudes that.",

We invited two friends and we were completely and utterly embarrassed by how we were treated. Their happy hour \"rules\" do not make for a happy experience. They have lost us and our friends as customers. We had enjoyed their beautiful zen water garden and wonderful food and wine for the last couple years.  We will be going to our other favorite restaurant who treats us with integrity and respect....but most of all that they want and appreciate our business!",

Dirty nails and stained hands, probably by coffee... I get it. I can get passed that... But then the lid and coffee sleeve looked like they had literally been plucked from the garbage.  The lid had splashes of dried coffee and some mysterious black smudges. The sleeve had coffee stains all over it. Totally turned my stomach and ruined my latte craving. I understand that they're working with the morning rush, and making hundreds of drinks in the morning... And that might be their only sloppy cup served that day. I was really looking forward to a yummy comforting chai, and now  afraid to drink it.",

We were not rowdy, loud or \"endangering the safety of the staff\" in any way. Our server was excellent in every way. She told us that, unfortunately we would not be allowed to have any more to drink. I heard the general manager tell the staff we would not be allowed any more to drink. The general manager came out to talk to us. She  lied to us and said \" I can't believe your server treated you that way\". It was not the server's decision to enforce the policy. Again, I heard the GM tell the staff we were done. Yet she lamely attempted to blame the server. The service was great. I understand the reason for the policy. However, again, we were not loud or rowdy or dangerous or even inebriated. So, if you plan on having fun go to OHSO's or the Dubliner. Stay away from 32Shea.",

I usually just come here for coffee beverages in the morning/afternoon weekdays and weekends. I love their iced toddy (iced coffee), I get it all the time and drink it black, or an iced quad soy latte. Sometimes a strawberry nutella muffin or Turkey Cranberry sandwich, delicious and I highly recommend them!  However the baristas always appear super busy and never smile or say thank you to customers for their business. I'm also a barista, so i don't understand how hard is it to be friendly to customers, even during a rush... However they are usually busy so its possible they are understaffed. But i'll ask for a packet of butter and be waiting ten minutes and have to ask again!",

    "text": "I hate to do this, 32 Shea has been a favorite of mine for a long time, but our last two visits have been a total disappointment.  I get when a restaurant doesn't choose to offer gluten free options, it's extra work for the kitchen and it's more expensive and that's fine.  But when gluten free options are offered, the kitchen needs to get it right.  Too much is riding on it.  32 Shea started offering gluten free bread for its sandwiches about a year ago and at first it was great!  The staff was careful and my beloved stacked turkey was fabulous!  Lately though, the bread has been burnt or so cold it's obvious my sandwich was made first and left to sit while the rest of the order was assembled.  The sandwich has been missing avocado or had lettuce I had requested left off.  Today was a deal breaker.  The kid at the cash register couldn't have been out of high school and although I asked him to repeat my order, it came out on regular bread (45 minutes after I ordered it!).  The person who brought it to me told me that the gluten free bread wasn't on the order, but she did take it back.  My husband was done with his sandwich, his muffin, and his coffee by the time my order finally came back...with no avocado and with lettuce I had specifically asked left off.  Look, I know I'm picky, I really have to be, but I try hard to be nice about it and I tip well!  Come on, 32 Shea!  I don't want to give up on you!",

Biggest gripe is the traffic flow while ordering - no matter where I stood, I was in the way of another customer or one of the workers - the 'dance' to stay out of the way got kind of old.  Other than that - great experience!  Got the beef sandwich with a side salad.  Side salad was mixed greens and the sweet and tangy dressing played nicely against the more bitter of the greens - good stuff. The sandwich was nice.  The expanded patio is a pretty cool place to eat your lunch - and the way it was designed was really neat - liked the decor!",

The homemade green salsa they serve with the burrito is to dieeeeeeeeee. The sandwich is so tasty--I love the combo of turkey and avo on it. The toast can be a little dry without the mayo, but I'm willing to make that sacrifice. Mayo, blech. We always enjoy their very delicious iced coffee. We've also split pasties and muffins and they are choice.  The inside is a little cramped and ordering can be hectic, but once you find a space on their idyllic patio (seriously, so zen and dreamy), it's a breeze. We had our pup in tow on our most recent trip, and the patio is so dog friendly. Lots of head pats and other friendly doggos.  We aren't in this area a ton, but when we are, we love to stop by!",

    "text": "I have been coming to 32Shea since they opened in 2011. There are a bunch of great things to say, but my main proposal for why you should check them out is that you will be blown away by the design and construction of this business. The building is TINY and they have managed to make enough space for you, your family, your extended family, and all of their close personal friends.   Pro/Con: The food here is great, though I little pricy for the amount you get. BUT you must splurge for the bruschetta at least once.  Pro/Con: The cafe drinks are usually remarkable, though the consistency has been challenged by (what I attribute to) high employee turnover. BUT NUTELLA. Also, their chai. YUM.   Pro: The evening drinky drinks have been spot on every time.   Pro: 32Shea has every single coffee shop in Phoenix beat when it comes to atmosphere. It is extraordinary what they've done with their patio in the last few years. And whether inside or outside, SO romantic in the evenings. It's truly an inspiring space that I love to be in both alone and with company.  Pro: dog-friendly patio  Con: Service, like I said, is spotty. There's been some really cool baristas over the years, but for the most part I've had a hard time keeping track of the ever-changing staff.   Pro: drive-thru and call-ahead orders  Con: due to space their entry/line system can get a little confusing.   Pro: Their bathroom has dancing lazer lights, so you don't get bored when you pee like you might at other coffee shops.   GO THERE!",

What I've realized is that their iced flavored lattes are for the latte adventurous- I've tried pistachio, lavender, and mocha, and mocha is still my favorite. I've also tried their hot menu and baked goods, including their New Mexico breakfast burrito. I prefer the baked goods, but that may be because I have a solid sweet tooth, or teeth, if I'm being honest! But the New Mexico breakfast burrito holds its own with avocado, salsa, potatoes, and bacon for morning goodwill. The ambience is very zen, and they have a full bar as well as fountains outside with lots of plant life. If you're looking for a place to hang out, get some work done, or just zone out and day dream, 32 Shea is the place to be.",

Missing items, extremely burned toast, etc.   Today's example:    We always order the Yummy Yummy in my Tummy which on the menu explicitly states:  Yummy Yummy in My Tummy | 3.5 Warm Nutella + Fresh Bananas on Toasted Bread  Simple right??  Nutella, bananas, bread.    As you can see in our photo, they substituted the Nutella with peanut butter. (We weren't notified).

If I could, I would go here everyday (and have in the past for all three meals!).  Everybody is friendly and professional and the food is AWESOME! So is the atmosphere! This is my favorite place in the Valley for food, coffee and just a nice relaxing time.",

They created an impressively cute and unique space in an ordinary strip-mall parking lot! And I love that they are so dog friendly. Almost every table has a pup with them. When I went inside I wasn't expecting the interior to be just as well decorated! Even the restrooms were unique with some super cool lighting. And of course the food was great too! I ordered a mimosa and we got some bruschetta, the chicken raspberry salad, and the roast beef sliders. All delicious! My favorite items were the prosciutto bruschetta and the roast beef sliders, which had some yummy horseradish sauce on them. I want to come back to try breakfast! I already know they have great mimosas!",

Takes forever to get drinks. The food is bad. I have tried a different item each time. The latest was the lavosh. We have all had lavash before... Great toppings on a crispy cracker... The one I got this evening had so much cheese on it that by the time it got to me the cracker was soggy... It was horrible.  Great atmosphere but come on. The menu is so limited that they should be experts on what they are serving... And the place is so little you should never have to wait 10 to 15 minutes to ever see your waiter. Hope you improve. Too many options to get good food and drinks. Would hate to see this place fail. Not sure how this place has so many good reviews.",

Went there to get the New Mexico burrito. It was a average burrito and their salsa verde was homemade. Prob wouldn't get it again... however most Mexican food restaurants are closed on Sunday's so it was good alternative. Overall, I've been here a few times and food is okay not great... not life changing. They do have a cute patio.",

    "text": "After a busy morning and playdate at Imagination Avenue, my friend Jane B and our two almost two year olds had worked up quite an appetite... We wanted a quick lunch before their naptime, so logically, we checked Yelp for nearby lunch spots.    We didn't have to look far as 32 Shea is literally right across the parking lot... we decided to check it out and we were both very impressed.  32 Shea is a tiny little gem of a restaurant  on the corner of (you guessed it) 32nd Street and Shea.  It's colorful on the outside and inside both literally and figuratively... the staff couldn't have been friendlier - and that's even with 2 toddler boys making a mess as Jane and I tried to order and scarf our food down.  We each had \"the chop\" salad and shared two muffins with the boys.  The salads were fresh and a good portion size, and the muffins were delicious... (we had a carrot muffin and a raspberry muffin).  They actually tasted more like cupcakes, so I don't know how healthy they were, but I'll tell myself they were healthy ;)  The menu has plenty more to choose from as well:  all kinds of coffee drinks, smoothies, breakfast including egg sandwiches, burritos and oatmeal (served until noon), lunch and even dinner!  It sounds like at night the place becomes more loungey with candle light and table service (as opposed to the order at the counter style they have during the day).  I'll have to check that out!  32 Shea reminded both of us of the type of cafe you'd find in a more urban environment like NYC or perhaps even Europe.  The building used to be a drive-thru photo mat and was then transformed to another restaurant before the current owners took it over in 2011.  They've done a fabulous job with it, and it still has a working drive-thru and a nice patio too.  I have one request of the owners: please get some lemonade on the menu!  I wanted an Arnold Palmer but was told you don't have lemonade, so that is something I'd suggest.  Other than that, it looks like you've got something for everyone and I can't wait to return to try more from the menu!",

    "text": "In a seemingly abandoned strip mall, my girlfriend and I found this little nook planted right in the middle of it.  We were looking for breakfast after a morning hike and this seemed to get some pretty good reviews.  Really fun little find.  It's not quite a coffee shop, but not its not quite a restaurant, and its not quite a wine bar.  The menu isn't very expansive, but what they do have they do pretty well.  For breakfast I got their croissant sandwich with egg, bacon, and cheese in a baked croissant.  Also couldn't resist trying one of their blueberry muffins.  And decided to wash it down with a nutella hot chocolate.  The croissant sandwich was fresh, simple and delicious.  The nutella hot chocolate was awesome and perfect on a cool fall morning.  The muffin was actually a little disappointing as it tasted a little dry.  My girlfriend got their New Mexico Burrito as well as a nutella mocha.  And they also had a brie and apple turnover in the pastry display so she got one of those.  She loved the mocha nutella and the brie and apple turnover was an awesome combo of flavors.  The burrito was scorching hot, but good and the salsa was a nice accompaniment.  As mentioned, its pretty small.  You order from the counter when you walk in and they bring your food to you.  There's a small seating area inside as well as a nice patio outside.  We sat at the outside high table area which looks down on the patio tables.  The atmosphere is very casual but has a modern feel that attracts locals from the neighborhood and hipsters alike.  And the outdoor patio is dog friendly (at least three couples we saw were taking advantage of this today.  Overall prices are right and the atmosphere is super relaxed.  Total cost for the two nutella drinks, two pastries, burrito, and croissant sandwich was $23.  Food wasn't perfect and the selection was minimal, but we'd definitely come back to sample more of their menu.",

For me, it's good coffee, either a savory or sweet entree, and a place where people enjoy conversations. This place meets all that and they have happy hour mimosas, bloody Mary's, and craft beer. Do I even have to add it's a 12 hour long happy hour? Oh yea, that just happened!  There's plenty of places to park, but you'd think this little place would not be able to pack all the goodies food and drinks have to offer. Well, if Reno is the biggest little city in the world, this has to be the biggest little breakfast place in Phoenix. They also have a drive thru. Can I get a woo woo?  I was not too fond of my wife's choice of the  Nutella Coffee even though many people on Yelp rave about it. I did enjoy my soy chai latte. The New Mexican burrito was flavorful on the initial bite. With the egg, spices, and meat, wow this thing is good, and it's a great portion size. My wife ordered the lox, which was salmon on top of a bagel. Lightly salted cured salmon with tomato and a fresh spread of cream cheese. Very light and tasty.  The staff looked very busy on a Saturday morning. It was our first time there, and no one greeted us or asked us to check the menu. We waited for a couple minutes and accidentally asked a customer (assumed he worked there as he fit the hipster kind of look) if we could sit ourselves down. After he said you can go ahead I realized he didn't work there, apologized, then finally asked one of the busy baristas, and was able to finally order. I will say the barista was very helpful, but busy during our order. As a result, I had to knock off one star.  Overall, what a great morning hanging with our neighbors and enjoying a meal where I felt satisfied and not over stuffed. I will definitely be back again!",

    "text": "It is rare to find a drive-through that actually serves healthy food. Thank you, 32 Shea, for bringing fast and nutritious food to those in a hurry in the north Phoenix area.  I've never actually ordered food from the drive-through myself, but every time I've observed a sale, it seems to be delivered quickly. The menu consists of coffee drinks (and a full bar, though alcohol can't be ordered from your car), as well as salads and sandwiches and a daily soup. With the sandwiches, you get a side of chips or a side salad. I've always gotten the salad, but I prefer swapping the house vinaigrette with ranch. As for the sandwiches, the veggie sandwich, which comes with cream cheese, tomatoes and greens, is tasty - just go light on the greens, unless you'd like a second salad on your sandwich.  32 Shea has a lot going for it - a really cute patio with comfy seating, and eclectic design inside that creates a funky, relaxing ambiance. I really like the restaurant has a bar area. The space can be anything you want - eatery, coffeehouse, bar, patio, or drive-through -- which is awesome.  Every time I've dined in for lunch, though, ordering has been an awkward experience. The ordering space is tiny, barely fitting two people comfortably, while anyone else is left to hover over them as they order. It'd be nice to just be able to pick a spot to sit down, then have a server come and take your order. The crampedness of the front ordering space is not a fun way to start your meal.",

We were craving some coffee one day and were feeling nostalgic about the drive through coffee joints in Portland, OR when we drove past 32 Shea.  My hubby ordered an Americano and he loved it.  I had an iced chai that was creamy and delicious.   A second time, we stopped here for a quick breakfast.  We both had the breakfast burritos that come with little cups of homemade salsa.  The salsa is so flavorful, and really enhances the flavor of the burrito.  It causes a serious case of heartburn later in the day though, so be ready with the tums!!  I would chance a little heartburn for another cup of salsa!",

Beautiful outdoor setting (inside is a bit small) with shade, umbrellas, misters and the ability to have protection from the traffic on 32nd Street Their drive-thru is fast, even though they have you pull forward and then bring your food out to you.   This is also a dog-friendly place on the patio, very cute little features for dogs (and dog parents).   Service is good and fast. You can tell they try to be efficient and accommodating. I have tried only the breakfast items since I'm out early hiking with my dogs. But I'm bringing my daughter here next time she visits (in November to run Ironman Tempe). There are lots of athletes who stop in here, as well as businessmen and women, and casual friend meetups.",

Everyone knows my wife and me by name and always have great service.   On Saturday night, we attended for restaurant week. We were quickly seated and ordered drinks. The place was packed but I thought the staff did a great job of attending to us. I ordered the artichoke dip,short ribs, with mole sauce and the chocolate mousse for dessert. I didn't plan to eat much of the artichoke dip, but it was so good my wife and I ate the entire appetizer. The bread served with it was perfectly toasted with a drizzle of olive oil. Next up was the short ribs, which I thought was wonderful. I like to try new things during restaurant week and the ribs did not disappoint. We finished up with the mousse, it had what I think we're candied almond pieces on top. It was creamy and delicious! We love how the chef is so creative with her dishes, echelon the specials every day.  Great atmosphere and great food! Well done.",

Hell I'm probably pissing everyone off with this review.   32 Shea has a great intimate feeling with a great shaded patio and smaller indoor dinning area. Had the perfect burrito coupled with the best Mocha Latte ever! This place has great service as well!

My husband was going to be out of town, so I had the nanny come, since I didn't want to miss it, this place being my suggestion.  I got there on time as usual, so I was the first one.  I asked the lady inside if we had a spot reserved since we were a group, and she confirmed and told me I would be seating outside in a minute. I sat down on the bench outside to wait to be directed to my table.  Five minutes later a couple arrived and went inside.  What do you know, the server was guiding them to a table outside.  That was a little rude, but I decided to just walk myself to the table.  My friend who organized the event got in just then, and I had only one menu for me.  The server again, said she would be right back.  I ended up going in and grabbing another menu. By the way, there were only 2 other tables with customers besides ours.  Not really a happening night, it was St. Patty's day after all, so people where drinking somewhere else.  We ordered our drinks.  They are really good.  A few other friends arrived and again we were struggling to get her attention and more menus.  One of the ladies ended up going inside to order her drink, she said the server was rude to her inside also.  We ordered a few bruschetta.  Mine was pretty good, but I wish it would have been a better experience.",

OK, I will say more: the bruschetta is $3 a pop, with plenty of delicious options, and they have a nice selection of wine and beer for $4-5, and mixed drinks for $6 during HH. It's not a beer bar per se, so they don't have everything, but they have a respectable selection. I will be coming back!",

I was sad that I couldn't enjoy the patio because it was honestly the one thing that really drew me in from the photos I saw here from other yelpers.  The interior was as packed as a small place this could be.  At this point I'm a little unsure about staying, no patio and tight quarters.   The staff was immediately very happy to see me and showed no signs they were at all put out by the weather.    I ordred a beer and the pizza of the day.  The waitress tried to tell me what was on the pizza of the day but I really wanted to be surprised so I asked her to stop.  All she got out was \"it's called black and blue\".  I was told the beer I wanted wasn't in stock or going to be carried anymore so I said surprise me with a random beer that is similar.  They brought me one of my favorites so I was very happy with their choice.  The pizza took a lot longer to come out than I would have expected but I really didn't mind.  The atmosphere was so comfortable that had I not looked at the time I wouldn't have realized so much of it had passed.    The pizza was great, I had fun figuring out why they called it Black and Blue and the waitress asked me if I had figured it out.  The blue cheese flavor wasn't overpowering nor was the blackened steak.  It was a very well balanced flavor over all and I enjoyed every bite.  I'm sure I'll be back so I can explore more of their menu and hopefully try out the patio area.",

Stopped by for happy hour the other night.  Service is normally a bit slow as its a  small prep area, but the yummy cocktails were always worth the wait.   Guess what, the yummy cocktail is gone....instead mixers have been changed and the cocktail that was so yummy now tastes like a melted creamsicle instead of tart and tangy.  The new outdoor area is cute though.  I am giving a 4 vs a 3 due to the past...let's hope they regain their old form.",

It's a super cute coffee shop and cafe by day and wine bar and restaurant by night. Or I guess by afternoon.  Their breakfast menu isn't huge but good if you're looking for a simple, smaller meal. We all opted for the breakfast burrito. (we each got our own, of course - haha) It was a decent size - not Chipotle-size but big enough for a meal. The tortilla was nice and soft and it was full of eggs, bacon and potatoes. On the side was a green sauce that added a nice little kick without being overwhelming. I thought it was very tasty and everyone else enjoyed theirs as well.  The place isn't very big, they do have a patio but in the summer that might be pretty hot. But it's got a good atmosphere and the staff was friendly. I would love to go back to try one of their lunch or dinner options.",

Not only does 32 Shea have THE best beverages in town (my new fave is a slow, gravity dripped iced coffee toddy) and killer pastries & food....they now have a liquor license and serve alcohol; a True bistro!  The outside patio is complete and looks amazing!  These guys are really hitting their stride!  Check 'em out!",

The decor is modern yet cozy, with plenty of large windows.  The people working there were nice.  The prices were very reasonable.  I enjoyed my veggie-tarian sandwich and appreciated that I was able to substitute whole wheat bread.  The only issue I had was the air-conditioning, specifically the seemingly total lack thereof.  Sure, there was a ceiling fan lazily spinning along, but in August in Phoenix it takes a lot more than that to keep a place bearable.  Just saying.",

    "text": "This was the perfect place for a lazy, Sunday brunch. Ample light coming through the big windows, the easy-going duo at the register, and the self-service water station (?) with copper mugs hanging on hooks all contributed to the calming, relaxing effect that permeated the relatively small joint (it sits maybe 20?). I had the OMG - prosciutto, mascarpone, and fig on Ciabatta bread. The combination of sweet & savory with the layer of creamy mascarpone and honey to blend the flavors was fantastic, and the texture of bread was really incredible. I would have been happy with just the bread and some soft butter on the side. I wonder if the bread is baked in-house? In any case, I'll definitely be returning for more \"wichcraft.\" Looking forward to trying their dinner menu too, and supporting a local business while at it. A couple of things I think it can improve on: Unkemptness - it adds to that \"hanging out at a friend's house\" vibe, with crumbs hanging out here and there...but it was a little off-putting for me. And no, I'm no neat freak - I used to troll around east bay eateries all the time, and God knows they're not the cleanest of establishments to say the least. Oh, and the temperature - a tad bit cooler, and it would have been perfect. Maybe it was because the to-go window was being open and shut constantly, but I didn't feel cool enough to want to stick around.",

The staff is very friendly and I noticed that they knew several customers by name. It is very comfortable with seating at the bar, table or on the patio. It is a great place to swing by after work for a quick drink and convo or dinner. I could see riding my beach cruiser here on the weekends with my dog in tow for an app and drink in the patio. This is a great place and much needed in this area. Well done!!!",

I don't understand the reviews that go on about the servers having poor attitudes. We've never felt a negative vibe. On the contrary, the servers and owner know our names and even our baby's name.
