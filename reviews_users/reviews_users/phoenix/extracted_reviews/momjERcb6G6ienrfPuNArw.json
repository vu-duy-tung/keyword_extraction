Just tasting the broth before adding anything - it was very good (dinner service). Next I tried a meatball - there's something different about the meatball, it was dense but had a full meatiness - what I mean, is some pho meatballs have a lot of gristle in them. This one did not. Added the usual suspects - it was a great bowl. Took home leftovers and was even better reheated.  Sorry no picture - but if you're pho eater, you're mouth should be watering!",

The service got worse and worse, our regular nice waitress left, and it was basically long faces on the folks who remained.  The place is dirty--dirty walls by the tables, with food encrusted on the walls from months ago. Super dirty floors by the entrance and below the booths. I think the kitchen is the same, but after getting a stomach bug we decided not to come back anymore.  ***********  We really enjoyed our meal here.  Food was delicious and fresh and RAPIDLY PREPARED.  Very nice ambiance; well-decorated and comfortable.  Equally as good as the other Pho restaurants we've frequented here in the valley - and the price is right.  $24 for 2 people, no drinks, ate until we were full.  We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I was craving some Pho and didn't have much time on my lunch break so I called Pho Da Lat since it was the closest.  I called ahead and ordered the #11.   5-10 minutes they said, which was great!   Prices were about .50-1.00 higher than most of the Pho places I've been to, but that's not bad. The broth was delicious, they were a little skimpy on the beef, but I could deal with that.   The problem and the reason for the lower rating was the fact that the host who brought my $7.00 pho to me asked if I needed change after giving him $10.00, Umm, scuse me? I contemplated about posting this as I don't want to sound petty, but.... I always tip for to-go orders at sit-down restaurants, at the very least 10%, and round up. But I was shocked this guy presumed I was going to tip 30+% on one item??  A little pretentious I thought.  How bout bringing my change first and let me decide if I am tipping? (which I was going to, but he seemed to be petty as well taking his sweet time bringing my change to me).  Sorry, but service goes right along with the food when it comes to rating,  This would have been a solid 4-star.",

    "text": "Oh, where to begin. While the food we had was good, the service, though friendly, was just atrocious! Not only did they....bring out the entree's first (Bun) and forget the garden rolls, they gave the wrong dishes to each, brought the dipping sauce for the appetizer we didn't get, told her to bring fish sauce for each of our Bun bowls, brought only one out, had to get another, had to ask for chopsticks, hoisan sauce and chili sauce. On the bright side, the bowls were very tasty and fresh. However, another gripe is the very high prices. I've eaten Vietnamese food at dozens of places and this was by far the priciest. A Vietnamese iced coffee was $4.50 that was maybe 25 cents worth of ingredients. Most other places it's $2-2.50 tops! You get a small, maybe three-four ounces of coffee dripping into a glass with sweetened condensed milk. Literally filled the glass of ice only half full. The Bun, which usually costs between $4-6 no matter where you go, was $10.95 to $12.50! Insane. Our waitress asked if we wanted separate checks, which we did, and when the check came, both receipts were wrong. The woman sitting next to us was also taking her waiter to task for bringing her the wrong dish twice. This seems to be a pattern here. At these prices, they need to raise the level of their service.",

We had to order it to-go because it was almost closing time. The serving size is good and so are their prices.  The flavor is VERY good, we had the pho with tendon and brisket, and brisket and rare steak. Overall is is really good food and I would recommend it. The only asterisk would be that the pho is a bit too greasy in my opinion compared to other ones we've had in other places (El Paso, Denver, Houston, Hanoi, Saigon). But as I said, the the flavor, pricing and serving size really make up for everything. Thumbs up!",

I guess comparing this place to Pho Thuan Kieu at Mekong Plaza, for the prize and the amount of side dishes that they give you here, Pho Thuan Kieu gives you more for your dollar.

A little water feature at the entrance with live koi swimming around, and very tastefully placed Asian decorations throughout.    My daughter ordered the spring rolls and I ordered the summer rolls to start, which provides me with my only criticisms from my visit.  It took more than 10 minutes to bring out our rolls -- and in fact, my daughter's fried spring rolls came out BEFORE my raw summer rolls!  I'm not sure if they had to drive to the nearest body of water to catch the shrimp in my rolls or what, but it took waaaaaay too long to bring out some simple rolls.  The summer rolls themselves were just okay, not as good as Maxim or Sekong by Night.    For our meals, I ordered the seafood pho (minus the fish balls) and my daughter ordered the curry chicken.  The broth of my pho was absolutely delicious!  It was flavorful and tasty, and I will definitely be going back for more!  It included crab, calamari and shrimp.  My daughter also enjoyed her curry chicken, although I wasn't that impressed with it when I tasted it, but, to each his own!  All in all, a good experience, and I'll be going back for more seafood pho.  But they just need to speed up service a bit.",

The decor is much cooler than what you would expect from the outside. They have done their best to make it look classy but still comfortable and low-key. I like the koi pond, that is pretty cool.  And the pho is much better when it is served fresh. I like the fact that they have so many different options. I had the seafood one tonight and it was very tasty and extremely filling.  As others have mentioned, their fresh spring rolls and those beef rollup thingys are winners too.  Add to all that the selection of affordable wines by the glass and tasty boba smoothies and that's it, I'm hooked. I love the fact that the menus have detailed explanations of the items so that if you aren't that familiar with Vietnamese cuisine you wont sound dumb asking a bunch of questions. The servers are all friendly, though, and seem to take pride in the place. So, I'm sure they'll answer any questions you want. :-)",

I've been eating A LOT of pho lately and this is one of the many places I've been to. I only eat seafood so my order is usually pretty standard. The pho itself usually doesn't have too much variation so I look at other things about the restaurant.  The price was just average compared to most pho places, nothing exceptionally cheap, but it stood out he place is a lot cleaner than most other Vietnamese places. The service was also great, they were very friendly and prompt about everything. I wanted an item that wasn't on the menu but didn't bother asking because I didn't think they would bother making a special order of spring rolls for me.

    "text": "We came in for lunch in the middle of the week so it wasn't busy. I wanted to try it out because I've visited the town that the restaurant takes its name after in Vietnam. (Visit that town if you're ever there. Very pretty.) We were helped right away and the service was pretty standard. The lady that helped us spoke Vietnamese so that made ordering more authentic for any of you individuals that are Viet.   The atmosphere was pretty casual as you are greeted with a small koi pond and water fountain with top 40 music playing overhead. The restaurant has many tables and booths so it's ideal for big groups. And the lighting is medium so it's not too dark. It's fairly clean inside though for a slow afternoon lunch hour, there were tables from previous patrons that were not cleaned for awhile after we got seated.   My girlfriend ordered a vegetarian spring roll and I ordered a \"Pho Dac Biet\" or a pho special. It has all the meats and fillings. My first choice whenever I visit a pho restaurant for the first time. They were a little skimpy on the fresh vegetable dish for your pho. The broth was ok. And the sliced beef wasn't freshly prepared. But overall the pho was still pretty tasty. It was just enough to fill you up. We stayed there for almost a couple hours afterwards to chat and were not bothered by the staff in any way. And they kept refilling our drinks so that's a plus. So all in all, not the best pho in town but I would return to try their other authentic dishes.",

I didn't feel like I was overwhelmed with noodles and they had enough meat in it to keep me satisfied. Their boba and cafe su da (Vietnamese coffee) was delicious as well. I've been looking for a new favorite pho place and I think this might be it!!",

The reason for the 3, and not 4 starts, is the price.  A regular bowl of Pho costs you somewhere between $10-12.  Couple that with an order of spring rolls or other entrees for the family, and you wonder whether a night out for Pho should be costing that much.",

The pho beef broth lacked any significant flavor and appeared to be watered down perhaps because it was getting late and they were running low, but either way, it was not good at all. Additionally, they use instant jasmine tea which should be an automatic no-no for any Asian style restaurant or any other restaurants for that matter. I chose this place based on the reviews, and was disappointed as a result. It's hard to give a restaurant another chance when flaws such as I've described exist.",

We had the veggie spring rolls, which are very fresh and delicious.  Our favorite is also the vegetarian Pho which has broccoli, mushrooms, baby corn, and other veggies in addition to a generous portion of rice noodles and is served with the usual plate of bean sprouts, thai basil, cilantro, jalapenos, and lime.  We typically add tofu as well and all of the ingredients are very fresh and high quality.  Another nice aspect is that they offer both the traditional beef broth and a vegetable broth.  We've found the beef broth to be a bit more flavorful, but for those adhering to a vegan diet, the vegetable broth would still provide a flavorful option.  Another plus is that this restaurant also serves alcohol and offers a daily happy hour, so it would also make a nice dinner spot as the atmosphere is more tasteful than many Vietnamese restaurants.  If you're a fan of Pho, this is a place you'll want to check out.",

I ordered the #8 Pho which included meatball, beef, tendons, sinews, and other parts I was unsure of but was completely delighted by their chewy and jello like textures in my mouth. I'm a texture person. The flavor was awesome as well. The noodles were perfect. Long, thin, and chewy. I had looked them up before going and saw they only took cash unless you spend over $15.

    "text": "Pho is one my favorite lunchtime eats.  I used to work on the west side of Phoenix where there are more choices of Vietnamese restaurants.  Pho DaLat was my first venture on the east side.  It's a great location off of Kyrene and Elliot Road and is upscale compared to your typical mom and pop shops over on the west side.  Good staff and fast service.  My problem was that food was not that great.  Not bad either, but not as flavorful as I've had elsewhere.  The Pho broth was a little weak even though there was plenty of meat in the bowl.  The veggies were limited to a small handful of sprouts and some fresh basil.  I would have love to have some mint and cilantro as well other leafy greens to throw into the steaming broth.  Just a bit skimpy for my tastes.  The spring roll were decent, but again missing something..  The menu itself seemed to skimp on other Vietnamese fairs.  Anyhow, not the worst, but not the best.  I'll continue to search out for a better bowl of Pho on the East Side..  My adventure continues...",

    "text": "Now before I go on with my review, I am originally from Northern California which is a Vietnam mecca (San Jose, CA), therefore there are pho joints on every corner. I've been to the good, the bad, and the ugly places, Pho Da Lat was somewhere in the middle. Not too bad, but OK.  I was craving some good Pho and my brother who has been living here for 9 years recommended this Pho place in town, Pho Da Lat. He praises this spot and I somewhat trust his intuition, sort of. So I gave it a try!  First off, they sell bubble drinks here (aka boba, tapioca drinks) and they were very good. You have a list of flavors to choose from and I tried their mango boba drink and it was delicious, now onto the actual Pho....  The broth, which is the main pull to my love for Pho was actually a little bland and not flavorful. Honestly, this is the foundation to a great Pho, you have a good broth, all else will be excellent! The broth was okay, nothing special. Also I didn't get receive much beef, it was actually quite sparse. My mother ordered a seafood Pho and she only had like 3 or four shrimps in hers, NOTHING. I will give them props for the spring rolls which were pretty good, I strongly recommend those if you try this place. The service was VERY good, the server was very friendly, helpful and patient! The restaurant itself was very clean and professional looking. I will go back, if my brother invites me again, lol.",

They have a koi pond inside right when you walk in, but I was disturbed at the size of the fish in that little pool.. Definitely not enough room, and I'm thinking this might be a violation, and i'm looking into it. I may eat fish, but I don't believe the living ones should be confined like that.. I certainly don't like elevators, do you?",

I would hope that Nam pla was a default accoutrement for most authentic Vietnamese restaurants. I counted 3 meatballs and a few slivers of the rare beef pieces. The quantity was smaller than most other ones I have tasted in the area. Ah well I don't feel too bad as I can trundle on down to Saigon Pho for the better deal and food",

The pork in the vermicelli bowl was tasty, but there was hardly any of it in proportion to the noodles and salad. The meatballs in the pho were rubbery and the broth was hardly a lukewarm temperature with a strange taste. When we expressed to the manager that the pho was not good, he told us it's always made with the same thing and his repeat customers like his food. He refused to take it off the bill and just kept offering to give us another bowl of pho....from the same batch.

The ones I love to go are along the light rail tracks on Camelback, and that's not a place you'd drive to on a daily basis. This place, wasn't bad. The phos tasted good, but something was missing. I don't know what's missing from the broth, but it lacked a bit of finesse, in my opinion. The broth still stands on its own, however, and it is good to go if ever I need a quick pho fix.",

The spring rolls were excellent. They had the perfect balance of ingredients and had a light, fresh taste.   The vermicelli was filled with the rice noodles, shredded lettuce, bean sprouts, and grilled shrimp. Overall, it was good and had a nice balance of textures and flavors and I especially enjoyed the grilled flavor of the shrimp.  The atmosphere is nice, with a koi pond and elegant decor.

Can't speak for the other dishes though.   The service is also good. Yeah, it takes a little while to get your food to you, but it's worth the wait. The owner is very nice.

And once my check came, it listed how much to tip, 15%, 18%, and 20%.  And seriously, you don't provide any service at all, why should I follow your suggested tipping chart?

    "text": "While our waiter, I think his name was Kevin, offered great service and was friendly and helpful, I was just very unimpressed with the food.   It should be noted that we were a group of 16 people, so things were a bit hectic for them. I ordered the Hainan Chicken and it took the longest to come out, after everyone got their pho and spring rolls. The chicken was dry and wasn't that good. The rice, although flavorful, was also dry.   My friend ordered Hu Tieu Xao (Flat rice noodles stir fry) and they brought out the wrong order and gave her Mi Hu Tieu (Clear Noodles Soup). After some more confusion and discussion, they brought out her Hu Tieu Xao but it was nothing like what we knew that dish to be. I finally realized that it must be a regional recipe since we were at Pho Da Lat, which is a region in Vietnam.   I took the Hi Tieu Xao on my tab so she could order something else and took it home. While it was flavorful, the noodles were all broken and not quite appetizing.  However, while I did not taste their pho, it did smell wonderful. The other members of our party that ordered pho did say that the pho is pretty good, but they didn't give enough noodles.   Considering that their prices were on the higher end of most Pho places, their food wasn't that impressive. Aside from the good customer service we received from our waiter, nothing else stood out to me and I don't think I would come back here.",

Let me just start by saying the pho here is fine.  It's pretty good.  But when compared to all the other pho out there in Arizona and California, I can't quite get it to even 4 stars.  First, a bowl of pho here costs about a buck more than most other places.  A buck, in relation to the cost of pho generally, is pretty substantial.  The broth is typically less flavorful than other places, though it is a very clean broth.  The bowl is a little smaller, meaning you get just a little less of everything (and when you get a pho dac biet, a little less of everything is noticeable.)  The spring rolls, also smaller, a little heavy on the noodle filling.    I've had a couple other random dishes from here which have been fine, but again, nothing outstanding, which is the general vibe of the entire place, thus the 3-star review.",

My mother had asked how much are their hot tea and the long haired female server explained in a way that we could not understand. Before we even asked her to clarify about their prices, she walked away. She ignored us whenever we need something from her. We decided to ask the other two male servers to get some orders and utensils for us. After the girl came back from the kitchen with the two male, they all gave us attitude and tossed utensils that we had asked for on the table. How rude??? My uncle was rolling the table to get food and the male server was dropping the vermicelli noodles for us. That server told my uncle to \"just stop\" with an attitude. Towards the end, we said excuse me to call our female server over... she didn't acknowledged us or even look at us. She set her broom aside and ASSUMED that we wanted ur checks. Each time we said excuse me to ask for a togo box or ANYTHING, she walked away as if she didn't hear us... UNLESS we YELL out excuse me. We are sure that we said excuse me loud and clear for her. Before we left, we asked the female server what is her name. She asked us \"why do you need my name?\" And pointed at the receipt and walked away! Are you serious? Are we not allowed to ask for our server's name either for yelp review or anything? Just know that they have lost another customer. TERRIBLE EXPENSIVE PRICE, RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Not to mention, all the servers checked up on all the customers , EXCEPT FOR MY TABLE!",

When I asked what was in the \"house sauce\" they told me that they didn't know and that none of the servers knew because they weren't the ones in the kitchen making it.... OK.  Food: Really good! A lot of different options. I had the #11 pho with brisket and flank steak but added rare steak. Lots of meat so that's always good. I didn't even try the broth before adding a bunch of basil, jalapenos, sriracha and chili paste so I can't comment on that.   Drink: Their wine list is pretty great for a pho place. They also have great prices on the bottles so that's always a plus!   I probably would eat here again if I was in the area but definitely not a place I'd go out of my way to eat at.

However, I saw other people eating rice dishes which I'll def go back to try.  It's hard to find good asian food in AZ.  Note: If you plan on using CC than make sure you purchase more than $15 otherwise you will be charge .45 cents to process your CC.",

The place is oddly named, though -- they're really not a pho shop, at least not in the sense of what I usually see at similarly named restaurants here in OC.  Their pho really isn't even all that good, but the rest of their dishes are usually quite tasty.  The look and feel of the restaurant is also decidedly more upscale than your average pho restaurant.    They've got a good variety of dishes, and everything that we've tried  (other than the pho) has been very good.  In an area where there's relatively few good Vietnamese restaurants, it's definitely worth a try.",

I've been going to Pho Da Lat for about the past year and have to say that in the beginning it was great... superior service, quick and tasty food and priced right!  However, my last three experiences... not so good!  After the first two I should have known better!  Generally my coworker and I get the same thing... Veg garden roll and peppered tofu to share... The last time we ate in this is what we ordered.... suffice it to say the server was not very gracious that we were sharing the dish and asked if we wanted the dinner portion instead (never been asked this before and we've ordered the same thing probably a dozen times in the past year!)  We agreed thinking that maybe that's what we had previously been given.  It was not.  Hmmm... same size as we had always gotten but more expensive when the check came!  Oh wait,  not to mention when she brought the dish out it was not what we had ordered and literally had to get up from the table and walk back to the kitchen (after a 10 min wait) to have the dish corrected (brought shrimp when we ordered tofu.)  Needless to say... not a great experience!!! So last week I had a serious craving for the veg garden rolls! Just those... nothing else! So decided to call in an order and go pick it up... Called the number that I got from google...  Oops not the right number, actually seemed like someone's cell phone but he must work there since he was nice enough to provide me the right number.  Anyway, called the right number, placed my order and was told that it should be ready in 5 min... Great! Left work and went right over there... Got there in probably closer to 10 min... order not ready... not a problem... glad to be out of the office... I can wait... Order ready, and I hand the host my card... he gives me a funny look and asks if I have cash.  Nope, not on this day.  Hmmm... could have told me on the phone that I needed cash... Dontcha think???? Apparently not... Never had a problem using my card here before  but I guess we always met the min.  So figured... OK I'll order the peppered tofu and throw it in the fridge at work and have it for dinner.... Still not enough!  Actually had to add a to go tea on to the bill so he would run the freaking card!   I won't be going back anytime soon considering that the peppered tofu was completely over spiced and undercooked and in generally just a really bad experience... Even if it means not having Vietnamese for lunch occaisionally... I'll survive! Skip this place... You never know what your going to get!",

Gone are those days when the waiting staff were shy but politely chatty and regular visitors were acknowledged. Now the prawn or meat in a bowl of Bun has dwindled, smart but precise waiters have been appointed and the prices have been hiked along with the number of discount -announcing advertisements in local newspapers. I sincerely wish that this restaurant finds its footing once again because it has always had quite a few things going for it, like good quality food, quick service and some great ambiance.",

    "text": "Alright! This is my very first review and it's negative for the simple fact that I just had the worst experience at a Pho restaurant.   I called in a to-go order at this place, that included Pho and spring rolls, and the host on the line stated my food would be ready in 10-15 min, thinking that is pretty long in my head but I did order crispy spring rolls with lettuce and mint leaves, so i say \"sounds good.\" I get there 15 min after I placed my order and tell the host I was there to pick up and he gave me a deer in headlights look and said \"we are running behind do you still want your order?\" Not thinking he might have not placed my order when I called in (which is exactly what happened) I said \"yes.\" It's raining out and I love Pho when it's raining! I actually waited another 20 min before my food came out while 2 other patrons came in and received their pick up orders. I said something to the host about it taking soo long 10 min in to the wait and again the deer in headlights glare came back and he said \"sorry we're just so busy.\" I would be OK with this if he would have told me on the phone that it would take 35 min to make Pho even though it's just broth and noodles!! I will never go back to this place, I will stick to my Saigon Pho on Alma School in between Warner and Ray in Chandler to fulfill my Pho needs!  PHO YOU PHOCKERS AT PHO DA LAT!!!!",

    "text": "One simple word for you.... BUN... This is my go to dish on a  hot summers day, my mouth is watering right now just thinking about the cool, crisp, deliciousness. Living in Tempe there are probably 5 Vietnamese restaurants within a 4 mile radius of my house, most of them are mediocre at best. So I decided to drive out of my normal Tempe hood and check this place out. I am the takeout queen... having an active 2 year old makes it hard for me to actually sit down in a restaurant and enjoy my meal, so I opt for takeout 99% of the time. I ordered the Bun with chicken, and a side of spring rolls. The customer service was awesome, the ladies were super nice. While waiting my son enjoyed watching the little koi pond they have. Back to the food.. It was very good! The bun was perfect temperature, the fish sauce was the perfect balance of salty and sweet, and when I asked for extra sauce they gave me a ton without flinching.  The spring roll were amazing, probably some of the best I have had in the valley. This is my new favorite close Vietnamese place, maybe soon I will try the pho since it seems to get pretty good reviews!",

They give you about 4-5 shrimp and they are huge really wish they would cut them down a little smaller. As for the Pho, it's pretty good but I've definitely had better. I always have to ask for more sprouts and lemon because they just don't ever give enough. I will be back because this the still the closest place for Pho by my new work but I'm only giving 3 stars.  :-)",

    "text": "Our favorite waiter left the restaurant about a year ago and since then, the service is really crappy to the point now where I have to update my review. Before he left, He told us that the other waiters felt like we were bad tippers and he was surprised to hear that because we always gave him a big tip. We didn't take offense to him telling us this because he knew that we use to wait tables before and our tip is solely based on the service we receive. He even backed us up and said that if they want a better tip from us- they have to learn how to give good service.  My update isn't about the food much because I still think the food is good and we visit this restaurant time to time just for it. Kudos to the chef! The bun bo hue is delicious!!  What I would like to express to the staff and management at this restaurant is that, if you expect your customers to tip well, you must first provide good service.  For example, if you drop off the food and never check back on your customers until they flag you down for the check and water, do you believe that you've earned your tip simply by taking an order and delivering the food? I know some waiters believe that there is justification for giving bad service if the  customer is a bad tipper--but let me tell you, if this is your understanding of customer service, you may want to find another job.   I almost want to give the staff here a free lesson on how to be attentive to their customers and what good service is all about if they get butthurt over tipping.  As a waitress, I had customers who actually followed me restaurant to restaurant. As a customer, I enjoy getting to know the wait staff and try to be as easiest customer.   Now, yelp readers must be wondering how bad of a tipper my husband and I are if the wait staff labeled us cheap. For shitty service we still give 10% because we've waited tables before, however, our tipping is usually above 20%.",

Response: no manager here! We walked out, after having wasted an hour for nothing! AVOID THIS AWFUL PLACE,",

I told him this was wrong and he returned the food and asked me to specify on what i wanted again and I did, and he came back with the wrong sh*t again. This time it was even nastier because it looked like they didn't want to waste the previous soup and somehow extracted the liquid to make the \"sauce\" and just added different noodles! The color of the \"stir-fry\" looked exactly like the color of the soup that i returned!! I tried it and then it tasted so SWEET LIKE THEY USED FISH SAUCE (NUOC MAM)!! WHICH IS WRONG!!! I was even more frustrated when the manager came out as if i was in the wrong! she was like \"ok, what do you want!\" showing me the menu. I had it and didn't order anything else because the service was terrible and the food was even WORSE!!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. (THERE IS MORE I WOULD ADD BUT ILL END IT BY SAYING IT IS THE WORSE VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT AND FOOD EVER)",

Initially I came here on a lunch break with co-workers and since then I've been back with them, with family, and friends. The Pho broth is tasty, the selection of meats is nice and the serving is huge! The rolls they have as an appetizer are great as well. But since first trying it with my b/f my favorite thing on the menu is the delicious Ginger Clams, man they are good! My friend May always gets the vietnamese coffee with the condensed milk and I love their Thai iced tea.  I always leave full and happy, everytime I visit. Plus not long ago they did some major renovating and the place looks really cool and fresh. Totally recommend, 5 stars!",

The flavor is so good that by the time you're done with the broth you're wondering where the rest of your food is.   There isn't a lot of meat and even the noodle portion could've been a little bit more. I like when places have the extra large bowl option because I'm a big guy and like to eat a lot.  I felt like the service was nominally all right, but when it came time to pay I had to keep waving my money around in order to get someone to come let me pay so I could go.  I feel like I want to give a 3 1/2 star rating on this place but in all fairness because the broth is so good I gave it a four star.

I let the waiter know and I love that they did just brush it off. He told the manager and they took the bowl off my bill and offered me a new one togo. Most places will just have a oh well that sucks attitude, but the way they handled it I will still go there and eat. Thank You!!!",

I asked why and the poor waiter said that when they don't charge for it, the owner takes it out of their check.. Are you kidding me? Not like I needed 2 dollars, and not like it was a big deal but it was when the waiter told me about the owner. I will never be back and don't recommend. It looks like they are struggling anyways so good luck attempting to obtain clients with the way you practice  your business and treat your employees. If you are the owner, and you want to reach out to me and talk about it let me know. I'd love to give you a piece of my mind.",

The broth is so tasty, not overpowered by cinnamon or anise or salt.  I do miss the side of cilantro that other pho places include....But this is quick and satisfying and cheap.  My journey to find the yummiest pho is not complete, but this place is great and tops my list, especially considering it's so close to home.  Another favorite are the beef roll appetizers.  It's thin meat, marinated in like hunan sauce, filled with caramelized onions and rolled info a little finger food and served with some dipping sauce.  All the other dishes I've tried have been good, although when you say spicy it doesn't really come out \"spicy\".  They do charge a convenience fee for totals of $10 or less if you're paying with credit card, the staff is always friendy and the place is clean with a very low key atmosphere.  The kids love the fish pond at the entrance.",

On the other side, a lot of my American coworkers won't go to a mom and pop pho house.  Pho Dalat is somewhere they would be okay with.  If you're on that side of town.. have a pho craving.. then Pho Dalat will definitely cure that.. but don't get expected to be wow'ed by the complex flavors of the broth",

We ended up just leaving it that way, we just made sure it wasn't charged at the end.   The food had good flavor, but it wasn't particularly fresh. We both had chicken pho. There wasn't anything particularly special about the food here.   One thing I didn't like at all was that they had large fish in a tiny little pond by the entrance, which is awful, poor things.   Also, by our table, there was this (adult) guy putting his bare feet on the booth seat and touching them.  I'm not sure if there's anything the management could have done about that, but it was definitely gross, especially in an eating establishment.",

Wonderful atmosphere - koi fish, mini waterfall, wonderfully decorated. Perfect for a date night on a budget.   My partner had some kind of Pho with meat (beef, I think), and I had the veggie Pho. Our waitress was thoughtful enough to ask if I wanted beef or vegetable broth.   We both received huge bowls of Pho with plenty of the condiments - mint leaf, jalapeno, lime, and bean sprouts. Our food came quickly and was piping hot. The vegetables were perfectly done - still fresh and with a crunch, but cooked through. My partner loved hers, as well (and she's one of the pickiest eaters I know when it comes to eating out!)  We walked out of there after getting two bowls of Pho, a diet Coke, and a Thai Tea and only spent $20+tip. Our waitress didn't bother us every two seconds, but was very attentive when we asked her for something - drink refill, to go box - which is how I wish all waitstaff were! We walked out of there 2 minutes until closing time, but never felt rushed. We'll definitely be stopping by again!",

I then opted for Vietnamese food.  I am rather new to Arizona, but have visited Saigan Pho in Tempe area twice thus far with my room mate, but wanted to try a different place.    I walked in and was seated right away.  I am not going to lie, when I first arrived the parking lot was almost fully empty, with just one SUV parked in front, which made me a little skeptical.  I walked in to find just one couple eating their food.  The aroma coming from the kitchen welcomed me and as soon as I opened the menu, I knew that they were serious about their Vietnamese food.  I ordered the fresh shrimp and chicken spring rolls, which come with a delicious peanut sauce.   My main order was of the seafood Pho which consisted of big delectable shrimp, squid, fried fish cakes, and crab meat (imitation, but still yummy) in a rich and flavorful pork broth.  I wanted to try something different, so I chose the yummy pork broth, as opposed to the normal beef broth.  I also had them combine two different types of noodles for me, ramen and clear ones.  The combination of the various flavors and noodles, really enhanced the meal.  I also enjoyed a cold Sapporo beer, which for happy hour was only $2.00.  I love their happy hour prices for appetizers and beers.  I will be back for more happy hour deliciousness at Pho Da Lat.   BTW, I went to wash my hands before I ate and the bathrooms were beautiful and clean and the waitress was very attentive and sweet.  I think I may have my next East Coast foodies event here.  THe prices are amazing, the food is delicious and plentiful, and the ambiance is welcoming.",

On a rainy Saturday evening, we were craving something hot and wholesome. After driving down to Paradise Cafe and discovering they were closed (who closes at 8 on a Saturday night??!) and then to Whole Foods and finding their food counter full of the day's last leftovers, we headed to Pho Da Lat.   Not a bad  choice at all! The waiter was really attentive and our orders came really fast. It could be because the restaurant was almost empty. It was good we didn't order appetizers because then I'm sure we would have needed doggy bags. I got the well-done beef shank pho and my friend got the Pho Da Lat special. Our orders came in huge bowls, filled with steaming hot liquid, meat, and veggies, with a side of a few bean sprouts, a lemon wedge and some basil leaves, and of course Hoisin sauce and hot sauce. I'm glad I went easy on the sauce because the pho was so hot (not spicy hot...temperature hot) it made my eyes water. Well, as I said it was my first time having pho, so I don't really have anything to compare it with. But boy, was it delicious! It filled me up,, and it was healthy...so yayyyy pho!",

I like to add extra limes in my soup for some extra sourness. The service was great as well. When I ordered my Vegetarian Pho, the waiter immediately asked me if I wanted Veggie Broth. The only downside was that they charge $0.45 for a credit card charge of under $15. If you are going to go by yourself, make sure to take cash unless you are planning on buying two meals.",

I like to be the Yelper that proves everyone else wrong! or something like that.  went at the end of the lunch rush.... and no one was at the hostess station. so i stood there for a good few minutes before being noticed and seated.  since i was planning on ordering spring rolls, i stopped by the restroom to wash my hands .... and was DISGUSTED at the squalor.  yes, i just said squalor. it was that bad. filthy.   i had the nem nuong cuon (grilled pork sausage spring roll). it was decent, but definitely not the best i've ever had.   i was all excited to try the bun (vermicelli noodles), because the waitress told me a i could get 1/2 chicken and 1/2 beef.... the meat was oily, sparse, and..... just lackluster, which is strange because all of the ingredients were there.... it just fell so short of the mark.   i then proceeded to wait for 10-15 minutes for my bill. well for anyone to come pick up my empty dishes and bring my bill. AND... does this bother anyone else but me? they give you the bill in an AmEx folder thing that says \"we take AmEx\" and then... they tell you they don't take it. anyways, i had to wait another few minutes to have my card picked up so i could pay and get out of there.   were there warning signs? yes, and i should have listened. such as the overall Yelp reviews were pretty bad. there were pretty much NO other Asians in the restaurant - it was filled with middle-aged businessy white-folk. And the decor was trying too hard to be upscale. sigh, so disappointing. too bad.",

Today, we ordered out and got an order of spring rolls, a #9 rare pho and #39 grilled chicken and rice. The spring rolls were a pretty big disappointment. They were soggy (but they were to go), kinda chewy (too chewy) and they came with fish sauce I'm not a huge fan of. My grilled chicken and rice also came with fish sauce. I would prefer something else and I know you can ask for peanut sauce instead. The pho was good (as I was told) but nowhere near as good as khai hoan. They recently did some remodeling. Overall, it's pretty good and I would recommend it to someone looking for a spot in this area to get Vietnamese.",

I don't eat a whole lot of Vietnamese food, but this place is real close to my neighborhood so that is always a plus.  They have made the restaurant bigger so there is plenty of seating although they due tend to be busy around lunch time.  The last few times they weren't breaking any records for speed even though my waitress was very nice.  I'm not sure this would be the best place if you are in a hurry. I appreciate the vegetarian options they have on the menu.  I thought the Vegetarian Pho was very good.  I haven't had many versions to compare it too, but it was much much better than the vegetarian versions I have had at the noodle shop downtown. The Tofu Vermicelli is really great.  it;s a cross between a hot noodle dish and a salad.  Which sounds kind of odd, but it's very good. They also have a pretty efficient take out so calling in and picking up isn't a problem.  Try:  - Vegetarian Pho. - Tofu Vermicelli",

She was rude and I mentioned I didn't even sign the receipts yet. So she gave me back the receipt book and I had to just leave a zero tip.  I used to come to this place almost every week.

They have 1-5 of spicy level, which 1 is the lowest spicy and 5 is the most spicy. I went with the 5 because I love spicy food and especially  when it comes to bun bo hue.   The broth and noodles cooked perfectly but it missing some stuff such as pork blood and pork feet, but overall I think it's the best bun bo hue  I ever ate in arizona. The spicy level was perfect for me and also it's not over powering. I love the Vietnamese ham that they put in there and the veggies were all fresh.   The service was nice. Our waiter came to our table to check on us from time to time to see if we need anything else. The restaurant was clean and well organized. I would definitely recommend here if they want to find a decent Vietnamese restaurant. I am looking forward to come back to try other dishes on the menu.",

I had ordered the bun bo hue and had thought my waitress brought out the wrong dish since there wasn't any pork blood or pork knuckles. Turns out that this place is just an Americanized pho restaurant that doesn't carry pork blood. Ugh. I should have read the menu more closely. My bad.  The dish itself was disappointing. The noodles used had an odd texture and were super soggy. It didn't hold the flavor of the broth at all and seemed like they either overcooked it to death or reboiled leftover noodles from the day before (which is likely since they just opened up on the Sunday when we went). Minus the liberal use of hot oil as their preferred method of heat, the broth didn't have much depth or flavor. What a pity. This was my first meal back in town after an incredible weekend in the bay area! I did like the slices of the Vietnamese ham though.  Service is okay and the place is clean. They do seem to cater to a more Americanized clientele though. I won't be back.",

    "text": "We actually were surprised there was a Pho in Tempe, AZ. Of course we had to try it out. This was one of the fanciest vietnamese restaurant we've eaten in. It was very clean and I loved the seating arrangements with the booths and the ceiling was decorated with fancy lighting which dimmed the restaurant. It felt like a romantic lit dinner for my husband and I. One thing I also loved was THEY HAD HAPPY HOUR FOR APPETIZERS! (It was only for certain hours in the afternoon) who does that? THIS place of course =0)  We had two orders of fresh spring rolls that only came in 2 long rolls cut in half. I think they could of added another one, they actually don't give much. We also had an order of fried egg roll, it was delicious. The wrapper was a little different than most egg rolls. It had a bubbly crispy texture but good. Prices for the appetizers were kind of expensive, so its best to go when its happy hour.. but over all well worth it.  When you order the pho noodle soup, its always about the broth that makes a noodle soup taste good and this was really good! Had a beefy & sweet flavor to it. I had to add a little salt, but other than that, it was good! The mediums size pho bowl was pretty big, so it was just right for me.   The waitress and staff was great. They were very prompt and friendly to us. They checked up on us every so often to make sure we were doing okay and thats what I call customer service. If only all the pho spots had manners and decorations like them, but thats what makes them stand out! Sooo Pho Dat!!!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that our server was friendly, friendlier than most I have had a Vietnamese restaurants. However after she took our order we did not see her again until it was time to pay the bill. There were about 6 or 7 other tables in the restaurant and other servers walked by us constantly and ignored the fact we had been done and sitting there for 15 minutes.   Now onto the food, I got the easy rare Pho, when the Pho came out  I did not smell the usual aroma of onion, ginger and other spices that make Pho the best soup ever.  Instead I smelled salt. This was troubling. After tasting the broth I immediately knew what I was smelling and now tasting, beef bouillon. There was a very subtle flavor almost like watered down  Pho. The taste and flavor of the bouillon lingered on my tongue and left and and odd feeling in my mouth. This was probably the saddest excuse for Pho I have ever had. Real Pho requires a missive amount of bones and spices to create the broth that soothes the soul. Now onto my husband, order the charbroiled pork Bun, his vegetables were mushy the pork was not anywhere on par with other places we've been. Again watered down flavor.   To top all of this off this place is more expensive that other Vietnamese restaurants we frequent. Save your money, visit another Vietnamese restaurants we have in the area, there are much, much, much better ones than this place.",

It is not cheap like the ones near ASU, but you get what you pay, it is 1-2 dollars more for bowl of Pho, but taste way better. It a little noisy on Sat after 9pm, as they have karaoke, other than, it is great. The size of lunch is smaller than dinner size and price is different too.

(He does add some rare beef to it though).  The staff is always extremely friendly and accommodating.    Happy hour is good.  I recommend the spring rolls, which are around $3 with happy hour.

The food is more expensive then other pho places I've been to. They also don't offer a kids bowl of pho. The food was ok. I ordered oxtails which were $14 but only had 4 miniscule pieces of oxtail the flavor was light but good. The worse part was that my daughter ordered a bowl of pho and they never brought it out to her, my husband and I were nearly finished and still no pho for my child (she was eating off of my husbands plate) we asked our waiter and he said he thought we ordered something in place of the pho (which never happened) he brought out the pho and I asked if the restaurant would cover the pho because we all were done and my daughter still wanted the pho. He said \"You ordered it you can pay, or we can take it\" I asked for the manager, she came out but she didn't speak much English. When I finished explaining what happened she ended up communicating the same thing our waiter stated. They never took ownership of the mistake or tried to make things right. After that exchange we sat and waited another 30 mins while our daughter finished her food. We left having spent $60 on mediocre food and horrible customer service. My family will never come back!",

The meat is thick and dry. It wasn't marinade well so the taste was bland. It was warm and not hot as it seemed to be microwaved and not freshly made.  Hot tea is free everywhere else and they charged$3 per person. When I asked another server, who wasn't our server, for a to-go box. Most American restaurants' servers would be glad to bring a box even it wasn't their table, not these weirdos who served in this restaurant. The waitress stared at us like we were aliens, then went to tell the supervisor that it wasn't her table. The supervisor then told the server who waited on us to bring us the boxes. I dropped my chin and couldn't believe it. Wow, such drama!!! If the restaurant was busy or that waitress was, I would not be shocked, but she stood around to chat with another server.   In conclusion, this place is not worth your money considering the quality or price. I'll NEVER return to this restaurant or give them my business again.",

Though later I have had multiple times are multiples places, I could now tell which one was really good.   The place gives a very old school restaurant vibe when u enter in. However you are seated immediately with the number of seating capacity they have. I have tried their roasted duck pho and the chicken breast pho. The roasted duck was really good and delicious. I can go to this place just for that.  However the chicken pho was average and the taste was a little bland to me.   Overall a decent place to eat but not the best Vietnamese food. The price range is alright. Give it a try for a variety in your lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "Walked in and the ambiance of this restaurant seems really friendly but don't let that fool you. A guy server/host came and greeted us but there was already a table waiting so we sat down. As we sat down we asked for a pot of tea and the server asked us how many cups because the female server (don't know her name) didn't explain well about the pricing of the tea. Had to clarify with a different server and apparently the tea is unlimited but they charge $2.00 per cup... that is ridiculous and it's the first time ever I've encountered a restaurant doing that.   Moving on, I ask the female server for some menus and she walked away without acknowledging that we've sat there for almost 10 minutes without menus! I saw some random menus laying on the counter and just went for it myself. She came back with some water and I had to ask if they charge for water because in some restaurants they charge for filter water... she then told me \"well if you want me to charge then I'll charge it.\" Excuse me but I was asking a serious question and all she did was walked away before I can say anything. At this point I'm really piss at this girl, she's rude and obnoxious. We had to get her attention several times to take our order and when she does she only asked two out the nine people that was there what we wanted to eat.. are you even serious because she can't even perform basic etiquette of being server...   Prices are freaking ridiculous here. Seriously, almost 13$ for a bowl of Pho... $4.95 for two rolls of spring rolls that are smaller than usual. Egg rolls tasted like it was refried several times, oven baked catfish was not marinated well at all, the sauce that came with the fish (mam nem) was so inconsistent with one being so bland and the other being very salty.   She never checked on our table to see if we needed anything and it's so unethical to treat all the other tables so nice and professional but when it comes to our table she gave the worst attitude and never acknowledged us when we call her. Asked for her name and she said \"why do you need to know my name\" and pointed at the receipt book then walks away! I've seriously gave up at this point as I was there for a birthday dinner so I didn't want to cause any scene.   I just think that the service here are very rude and it's unethical to be treating every table with respect and professionalism but my party had to worst night with her. We didn't come here for free food! We pay for our food and also gave her a 15% gratuity and that's how she treated us. My appetite was the down the toilet and my dinner was ruined because of the way she act towards us. Never will I step my foot in this restaurant again and I'll promise them that I will never recommend this place to anyone.",

It was really odd. They must host events because there's a stage and lights in half of the room. It's like they're not fully committed to being a restaurant. I would not recommend a friend go here based on the atmosphere. If they want an event space, maybe put up a movable dividing wall between the restaurant and the stage/event area? Also please get furniture for your guests because two people sitting at a large round plastic table is weird. Good food though.",

I ordered the combo vermicelli noodle salad which had shrimp, pork, and crispy egg rolls. The server took our order then after about 20 or 30 minutes my wife asked the status of the food, the server went back and came out a few minutes later asking again details in the order. About 10 minutes later our food came out. (We think they may had initially forgotten our food). They forgot extra limes, nbd we asked again. The didnt have any chopsticks, sriracha or hoisin sauce (my wife got pho) so we had to wait for that. I loved how crispy the egg rolls were, really the highlight of the salad. The rest was mediocre, no complaints but not amazing. My wife said her pho was bad. I tasted her broth and agree that there are other places with much better pho broth. The server dropped off the bill early but took awhile to pick it up. After we paid she just threw it back on our table without eye contact or saying anything and kept walking.  A few days later I got beef vermicelli noodle salad to go and it was again mediocre. Not very much meat, wish the fish sauce had more flavor.",

From the parking lot, it looks like a small restaurant but as soon as we stepped in it is actually a very large restaurant.   There are tables and booths, we were seated in a booth.  I ordered a seafood pho, Ron ordered the Chef chicken special. I also asked for a Vietnamese coffee, which was good. Food took time to be served. My Pho was disappointing. It was a lot of clear broth and a few rubbery, tubular chunks of squids, one small shrimp and one chunk of fake crab, one sprig of basil and some soy sprouts.  Ron's chicken was on top of a huge mount of steamed rice and it had been boiled to death.  The skin was pale and had goose bumps. Ron said it was just plain boiled and had no taste.  My bowl of pho was plain and not to be repeated.  Ever.",

Emma had the Seafood Pho which was suppose to come with shrimp, squid and crab meat. She counted a total of 1 shrimp in her soup to go along with a genetically manufactured substances they called squid and crab meat. It was rubber in texture. Not a type of fish she's ever had before. I had the Hainanese Chicken Rice plate. Per the menu it states it's a specialty prepared by their chef. What I received was a plate of rice to go along with skin on boiled chicken.....boiled. Like Emma's fish it also had a rubber like texture. Needless to say it was a horrible experience.",

Bad service, boring broth, stale tasting spring rolls, dry ass chicken, and barely any vegetables to put in the Pho.  Idk what the other menu options taste like, but as far as the Pho is concerned, go somewhere else like Pho Thanh (They are cheaper and taste way better).  You can go and try this place if you want, but you could also spend your money and get a better value elsewhere..",

The menu at first glance seems pretty expensive, $5 for two egg rolls, appetizers, etc. But if you come during their weekday happy hour (something like M-F 3pm-5pm) the appetizers are half off, which makes them \"normal\" priced as far as Vietnamese joints go. What you pay for is the nice atmosphere, everything is very clean, and the decor is very nice, and modern.   The bowls of pho are around $9-$10 which is expensive, but the bowls are actually fairly large so it evens out. My first impressions of this restaurant were that it was far too expensive to be a Vietnamese restaurant, but after seeing the large portions of pho and bun bo hue, I'd recommend this restaurant!",

Went on a Friday at 6:30pm and it was pretty empty, so we got sat right away by a very friendly server.   Ever since I tried Pho Ga at Noodles Ranch in Old Town, I've been trying to find a place just as amazing mostly due to location. I've tried two others in Mesa off Dobson rd. NOTHING has topped it yet. Here's why...  Pho Dalat's beef based broth was very tasty; I'll give them that, but there wasn't much chicken. Other then the usual add-ins provided with Pho, the soup consisted only of shredded chicken breast pieces and noodles. At NOODLES RANCH the Pho Ga comes with bright greens of broccoli and baby bok choy.   I'll continue my quest for a nearby pho place !",

You don't like it when people pay with credit or debit cards?  You don't like paying that 3-4.5% fee for electronic paying customers?  Huh.  Well guess what... you should build that into your pricing!  'Cause guess what?  NO ONE likes to see a sign that they will be paying 50 cents or whatever extra just because they don't have cash.  It rubs me the wrong way almost every time - and I know I'm not the only one.    So - in the best interest of your getting people to RETURN and RECOMMEND your place of business to others?  Get with the 21st century and suck it up - debit / credit cards aren't going anywhere.",

    "text": "Let me preface by saying I was born in Saigon.  I understand Pho like a redneck understands buckshot.  That's to say, both can be a total miss or to die for.  But, on average they both tend to hit the target.  People who get all worked up over whether the broth was too cloudy, or too sweet, or they got one lime instead of 2 limes need to loosen up a little about this treasured Vietnamese dish.  Pho Da Lat's pho is pretty average in a city where all pho is pretty average.  So I'm saying it's a good showing for pho in Phoenix.  So why 4 stars?    Two reasons:   1) The roast game hen is simply perfect.  It's not a typical dish in any Vietnamese restaurant and transports one to idyllic Provence.  Evidence of the French colonial influence.  It's charred and crispy on the edges and succulent in the meaty areas.  It's served over white rice and accompanied by cucumbers, cilantro and lettuce.  A small dish with salt/pepper & lime is for dipping.    2) These guys have a selection of wine.  Wine with Pho unheard of you say?  Don't pair with red wines, instead pick a dry white wine.  I chose the 2009 Farrier Alexander Valley Andiron (Semillon/Sauv Blanc) $6.  The hints of lime and bright finish go perfectly with spicy Pho broth.  It's also excellent with the roast bird.    The Pho and the Andiron are good by themselves but together they transcend.",

We requested spicy level 4 (out of 5), and I actually probably could have handled the 5.  We also had the Vietnamese iced coffee, and it was so good it puts Starbucks to shame.

The owner is often to be seen walking around and chatting to his clients and can explain a lot about the dishes. The ambiance is very nice with a good \"fung shui\" about it. The fish in the waterfall and pool at the entrance are gettingquite big now.  Tonite we had a starter veggie garden rolls,  1 x veggie noodle soup, 1 x spicey shrimp dish with rice and 2 x tiger beers for approx  $29. The owner threw in a free Tiger beer since we told him we hadn't seen the coupons in the Az Republic.... I took the shrimp dish with a level 5 spice - so it had me sweating a bit. My wife on the other hand likes her dishes very mild - and they are always able to suit her taste.  My wife has a sensitive tum to msg and such things and so has difficuly eating at some chinese or asian  restaurants without getting stomach-aches. However she never has a problem here and she loves the veggie noodle soup. The bowl is rather large so she never gets thru it all.  The veggies they use are all very fresh and the flavors are great.

However, this strip mall place is a step up from the average local Pho joint. The Crazy Noodle and Pho are both winners. The Vietnamese iced coffee is fantastic. Service is always great, prices are very reasonable.",

Not sure if it was an off day or they were running out of broth because it was late, but it was very bland. I probably won't take another chance on this place since I know of at least a few other places that consistently serve good pho.",

The salad rolls (garden rolls) were fresh, but too minty for my taste, but my boyfriend said he really like the heavy spearmint flavor that they had. Peanut sauce can be hit or miss, but their sauce was pretty good. Seemed like it had a smoked hint to it.  As for the Pho we had, so tasty. Not over oily broth, a lot of meat, and just the right amount of onions. I also like the portions of bean sprouts and peppers they bring for the pho. It wasn't a huge heaping pile that you feel like you are wasting by not using.  Looks like they have karaoke on the weekends or something. That along with their wine collection could make quite the pho-king experience.",

The only thing I didn't really like was the egg cake, never have... So not there fault. My friend ordered #39, grilled chicken and rice. It was her first time eating there and she loved it too. She is always picky about her food, but she was pleased with the outcome.   So overall it was a great experience!! Plus they have my favorite, Vietnamese coffee!! =)",

The flavor has a hint of lemongrass along with other herbs and spices which are essential building block of the soup.  It is NOT authentic but a very successful creation without all the grease.  The Vietnamese Coffee is in par with other places in town.  I have asked the bean sprouts to be cooked on the side and they were very happy to comply with my request..Will return soon and try their other items on the menu soon",

Whatevs, you can always spice it up to suite your needs. My order was ready very quickly, but prices were slightly on the high side.

    "text": "Was excited to find a pho place near Costco on I-10, since I shop there semi-weekly. I live in Laveen, which is not close to any pho--and I LOVE pho. I typically go to Glendale or north Phoenix for pho. I have tried almost every pho place in Phoenix, and this one would have been an excellent addition to my rotation because of where they are located. Despite the two stars rating I would go back to Pho Du Lat again if I am ever shopping at Costco or Total Wine, and having a craving for VIetnamese---however---let me be clear that it is only because of the location. But I'd be complaining about how much they charge for what I get AND the lack of some very important essentials. So, if you want an EXCELLENT pho place to try--THIS ONE IS NOT IT. Let me explain.  The restaurant is a good size and clean. Bathrooms are clean. Service is fine. Not spectacular, but basically good. You can get in and out for lunch in a reasonable time. The staff is lackluster, though. Let's just say unenthusiastic, okay?  I ordered a dry noodle dish (I chose egg noodles) that came with fish ball, pork, chicken, beef ball and shrimp. I ordered it because it comes with the pork broth on the side, and the entree has a *spicy* star next to it, and I like spicy dishes.  The server asked me on a scale of 1-5 for hotness. I chose a 4. So...let me tell you what I got.... I got an unusually small serving of food. A small portion of egg noodles that were cooked fine (but sticky, which is common, so I had to use my broth to separate them--not a big deal), but the meat was so freaking skimpy. There was a fish ball a little bit smaller than the diameter of a quarter. The beef ball was somewhat bigger, and cut in half. There were two medium/small shrimp (the menu says \"jumbo\"--but they aren't remotely jumbo) and there was a few strands of bland, boiled/rubbery flavorless chicken and two tiny, thin pieces of pork. The meat sat hidden under the small portion of noodles and on top was a smattering of ripped up romaine lettuce. The broth, as advertised, came on the side. The broth was good, and contained the grilled shallots. This dish cost $8, but you or I would have spent about 99 cents making it, if that. The heat level was around 1 or 2 at most. I had to request chili/garlic paste----and she returned with a meager tablespoon in a small dish.  There were NO herbs...No cilantro. No limes or lemons. No fresh, cut jalapenos. No fresh, chubby bean sprouts. NONE of the tables had any garlic/chili paste, spoons, chopsticks, etc.  My solo lunch included iced tea and an order of vegetarian spring rolls. The spring rolls were pakced tightly with romaine and lacked any herbal flavor. The sauce was primarily fish hoisin sauce with crushed peanut in it. I much prefer a thick peanut based sauce with chili flakes. This stuff was okay, but not what I prefer...  The total cost (NOT including tip) was $15.09. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR LUNCH. That being said, if the food was outstanding and worth driving to, I'd have happily paid $15 for it. It was NOT THAT GREAT. It was...MEH.",

I asked that the manager please remove the item from our bill since I was not satisfied with the food. The manager said he would give me another bowl, but I would have to pay for it. I didn't want anymore of there disgusting food, and the manager would not take it off the bill, so I paid, and left.   I will never return, and I would not recommend this place to anyone.

We also got the garlic Clams I think. The curry was a solid 2/5, and the Pho Tai, neither of us liked. The clams tasted great, but only about 1 of 3 clams, had something in them. They were all SHELLS! That is what really got to me, especially with the price tag for those guys. I feel as if i spent an equivalent amount of money on grade A Thai place, but had no satisfaction. I don't think I'll be coming back to this place.",

    "text": "I love Vietnamese food, so I just had to try this place.   I was pleased with this restaurant. They had great food and offered lots of variety in the menu, including rice dishes, pho, buns, and more. I never tried quail but it was surprisingly good (it tastes like a saltier/chewier/bonier version of chicken if you're curious). The sauce on top of the quail topped off the appetizer - I would recommend it. We had another appetizer - the tofu spring rolls. It tasted very healthy and clean, and I liked the peanut sauce that came with it.   I ordered the chicken \"bun\" noodles, which had rice noodles, lettuce, chicken smothered in sauce and a side of fish sauce. My friend got the vegetarian pho, which she enjoyed.   The server checked in pretty often and were very polite and helpful with our order. While we were unfamiliar with some of the menu items (like the quail), she provided us a detailed explanation of what the appetizer would entail. I'm glad that she did, because it convinced us to get the order. Yum yum!  I went to dinner on a Thursday evening and there were quite a large amount of people in there - Pho Da Lat has good business which shows that customers regularly go to this restaurant.",

As a vegetarian in Phoenix, I'm always starved for entree options, and I wish there were more dishes like this. I got this dish to go while I waited for my car to be serviced nearby, and a couple employees walked by to tell me how good my lunch smelled. I asked for it extra spicy, and the extra jalapenos added just enough heat.  I came back again with my husband to try some of their veggie pho, and I was disappointed. It was good but nothing special. My husband felt the same way about his beefy pho. We shared a plate of spring rolls, and they were so bland. Even the peanut dipping sauce had very little flavor.  We would still come back to try other dishes here. A big lure was the large wine list where all bottles are $20. The great $20 price tag puts many of the bottles right a retail cost which is awesome when you're dining out. Sign me up for some La Crema.",

The egg roll with cold noodles. Unfortunately it was a bit tasteless even after I add half a bowl of fish sauce in it. For drink, I ordered a fresh coconut.

The waitress was slow, doesn't know her menu, and a bit argumentative, had to ask for drink refills all night. When our food came out, which actually did not take long, we were disappointed at the skimpy vegetable servings for our Pho, the lack of sauce/gravy for the crispy egg noodle dish, and a complete misunderstanding of one of the orders. Not enough veggies, no problem, we just asked for an extra vegetable plate for the Pho to split between three of us, but it took them 3 trips back to our table to remember to bring it to us after 2 reminders. Then when we asked for more sauce for the dry crispy noodles, the kitchen came back and said they are unable to make more without making a whole other batch and essentially charging us another plate... As for the misunderstood order... My friend just asked for their chicken rice plate except he wanted to substitute the chicken with shrimp since shrimp rice plate was not an option on the menu, waitress said yes they can do that but will have to charge him extra which he was fine with. What my friend ended up with was a simple sauteed shrimp served over plain white rice in their smallest white rice bowl, nothing like what is shown in the pictures of their rice \"plate.\" After several run arounds and back and forth with the kitchen about the rice plate we thought they finally understood so they took his dish back to the kitchen and what came back was merely the same thing now served back to him on a white plate... To top off the ridiculous evening we were told we had to be charged a fee for using our credit cards! To be fair, the Special Pho was good but nothing spectacular, definitely not worth enduring the poor customer service when there are other Pho restaurants serving better food and with service that exceeds Pho Dalat's by 100%",

After being seated no greeting just stood there with pen and pad.....really?  I ordered spring rolls and bun bo hue soup.  Food was good but the empty appetizer plate and eaten soup bowl sat on my table.  No follow up for how meal was.  Even had to ask another employee for water.  Such disgust.  As a Vietnamese I consider this place catering to white type folks. I only said this because there was a white family that was sat behind me.  Omg server was as pleasant as can be.  Oh please.   Prices are high and portions are small.   My money is spent better elsewhere.",

    "text": "Pho Da Lat was a great impromptu lunch decision on a Saturday afternoon when I had an hour or so to kill with a friend. 2pm on a Saturday almost no one was in there, which I like.   We were immediately led to a table and given menus. The staff gave us enough time to look over our menus and think of any questions we wanted to ask in our heads first. When we finally ordered, we decided to try the quail appetizer and then each had questions on dishes. In response to my guest's questions, samples were brought out to try, which I thought was excellent.  I asked their opinion in regard to the best of the spicy flavorful dishes and it was suggested I try the lemongrass chili chicken which I did.   Unfortunately, our food came out and our appetizer was forgotten about. However, the food was plenty and I ended up not even being able to finish it all anyway. The spice was right on par and we both seemed to enjoy our lunch there.   I will be back again, as I found several dishes I wanted to try, which is the key to high rating and return visit with me, and hopefully next time I will try the 40+ advertised wines. All at once you ask? Hmmm... let's see where the night goes...",

The broth was very light and not too salty but it was missing something (I think someone else said this) and I will agree with the other poster about their rice dishes; that looked pretty good.  A friend had the veggie pho and that looked pretty delish, actually; and healthy.  Yes.  Bring cash.",

They were no longer greasy, hopefully last time was a fluke. The pho was awesome. I have never had a bowl of pho with so much meat in it. This time I got the #9 which was $1 more than the rest...maybe that's why.  Anyways, it was a very good lunch!",

    "text": "I've eaten here six times in the past year and can say that the quality of food and service has been consistent each time. Standard fare as far as Pho is concerned. I have not eaten here for lunch but dinner portions have been enough to take home for a second meal.  The spicy beef vermicelli is very good if you aren't in the mood for Pho. You can choose from 1-5 for the level of spice in the dish. If you like it hot then 4 is very good but I don't think a 5 would cause much trouble if you're feeling risky. Also, the garden spring rolls are worth getting if only for the peanut dipping sauce that accompanies them.   Altogether a good place with a nice atmosphere and attentive service.  ------ Update Feb '13: Five years later and I'm still a regular. The Combination Bun Tom has quickly become a summer favorite and the pho supplies me with a warm soup fix on \"cold\" (Phoenix cold) days. I'll even stop by and purchase a big container of pho broth to sip on if I'm feeling under the weather. I'm happy have this place in the area since good asian food is generally reserved for Mesa and I'm not alway in the mood for that trek!",

    "text": "The food was GREAT!  A large menu with a lot of options, lots of noodle/soup combinations, Vermicelli/meat and Rice/meat dishes.  Very reasonably priced too- with appetizers our meal came to $20 (we didn't get drinks though)! appetizers start at $2.99, entree's range from $6.95 up to $12.95.  I had the Beef with Lemon-grass Chili sauce over jasmine rice and LOVED it, it was very flavorful.  This restaurant offers \"choose your own spice level 1-5\".  I ordered a 3 and there certainly was a kick to it, I like spice though and probably could have done a 4.  The atmosphere was nice and clean, good earthy colors of green and brown helped add to the clean and simple feel.  The bathrooms were the nicest and cleanest I have seen in a restaurant in YEARS.    The only downside to the experience was the service.  The wait staff were polite and kind just dreadfully slow!  After finishing our meal we waited about 10min for someone to come check on us and offer us our check- no one came.  I had to flag down the hostess who brought us our check.  Placing our order was a lengthy process as well.  After we placed our appetizer order it seemed forever before they came back for our dinner order.",

The spice level is somwhat weird, it's 1 through 5 and a 9...I get the 9 and it is still full of flavor and doesn't taste like all chilli sauce.  The decor is relaxing, unlike typical mom and pop places where I feel a bit uneasy, the selection is great you can tell them to cook it anyway you like, with beef or veggie etc., the price is resonable.   The service is a bit slow, but I think that is the industy standard as far as asian cuisine goes.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I can't remark on menu items at Pho Dalat other than the spring rolls and the pho. And not the pho generally, but the chicken pho in particular. Problem is, every time I visit, I order the same thing, chicken pho, despite going in with an open mind, an empty stomach, and a curiosity about the menu. The chicken pho is simply too good for its own good! Picture it: Perfectly cooked rice noodles in savory beef stock, with shredded white meat chicken, bean sprouts, lime, basil, hoisin sauce, chili sauce, and a few pepper slices floating in the fragrant clear broth. The results are intoxicating. And the spring rolls! Light, crispy, meaty, with a balanced burst of mint and the lightest, most delightful fish sauce I've tasted in the Valley.  Let's face it: It's hard to screw up a bowl of pho. The ingredients alone virtually guarantee a good meal, as long as the noodles are cooked properly and the broth is decent. But Pho Dalat does pho right. Like their fish sauce, the broth is marvelously light, the noodles thin, perfect-textured, and plentiful. This is like chicken noodle soup on steroids, and you won't need anything else to fill up. Although, trust me, you'll want the crispy spring rolls anyway.",
